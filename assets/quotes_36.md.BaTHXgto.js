The song is listed as number 207 in the Roud Folk Song Index. Origin The theme of the shanty, which dates from at least the 1850s, may have been inspired by topical events in the news related to conflicts between the armies of Mexico, commanded by Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, and the U.S., commanded by Zachary Taylor, in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The lyrics are not historically accurate: for example, both the Battle of Monterrey and the Battle of Molino del Rey (different versions refer to one or other) were US victories, not Mexican ones. Some suggest that this tradition was caused by British sailors, who deserted their ships to join Santa Anna's forces. Lyrics As with many shanties, there are many recorded variations on the words and tunes, which may have developed on particular shipping lines - and the shantymen who led the shanties would make up their own versions as they went along, many of which were never recorded. Shantyman and shanty collector Stan Hugill wrote that \\"Santianna\\" was originally a pump shanty, but became a popular capstan shanty as wooden ships were replaced by iron in the common call and response form. Part of one of Hugill's versions is below The call is in normal type and the response is in italics. :O! Santianna gained the day :Away Santianna! :And Santianna gained the day :All across the plains of Mexico! :He gain'd the day at Molly-Del-Rey*. :Away Santianna :An' General Taylor ran away :All across the plains of Mexico :All of his men were brave an' true. :Away Santianna :Ever soldier brave and true :All across the plains of Mexico :Oh Santiana fought for fame :Away Santianna :An' Santiana gained a name :All across the plains of Mexico : *Monterrey or Molino del Rey Hugill states that there were many variations in the refrain, including: First refrain: :Heave and weigh Santiana :Hooray Santiana :And away Santiana :Hooraw boys, hooraw ho :Horoo Santy Ana :'Way Santiana Second refrain :Heave away, hurra for roll-an'-go :All on the plains of Mexico :Heave an' weigh, we're bound for Mexico :All across the plains of Mexico :All along the shores of Mexico :Along the plains of Mexico :On the banks and plains of Mexico :Around the Bay o' Mexico :All along the coasts of Mexico :Upon the plains of Mexico Alan Lomax published a completely different version, that he heard from a sailor called J.M. Hunt in 1935 :We're sailing down the river from Liverpool :Heave away Santy Anno :Around Cape Horn to Frisco Bay :All on the plains of Mexico Chorus ::So heave her up and away we'll go ::Heave away Santy Ano ::Heave her up and away we'll go ::All on the plains of Mexico :She's a clipper fast ship and a bully good crew :Heave away, Santy Anno :A down-east Yankee for her captain, too :All on the plains of Mexico In the 1950s and 1960s, shanties became popularised as part of the American folk music revival and British folk revival, and Santianna became part of the musical repertoire of musicians including Paul Clayton and The Clancy Brothers. Sometimes there is an additional chorus or bridge, after A. L. Lloyd: :Mexico oh Mexico :Hurray Santy Ano :Oh Mexico where I must go :All on the plains of Mexico Other versions=Covers in English One English version recorded by both Odetta (1956) and The Kingston Trio (1958) is about a ship that leaves from Liverpool to California \\"Plenty of gold, So I've Been told, way out in California\\". The Weavers album The Weavers at Home (1958) describes a journey from Boston to California. These versions are probably about the California Gold Rush and based on Lomax's version. The soundtrack to the game Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire includes a cover of the song called Aim Spirente. Its lyrics are similar to Hugues Aufray's Santiano, but adapted to fit the game's lore. The lyrics, written on a scrap of paper, can also be found as an in-game item. The Longest Johns covered the song on their album Between Wind and Water. Catalan-language folk group El Pony Pisador released a metal cover of Santiana in English in 2020. Covers in French \\"Santiano\\" was recorded in 1961 by Hugues Aufray and refers to a ship leaving Saint Malo bound to San Francisco, described as a wealthy place. It became very popular and has inspired several cover versions including the reality show Star Academy in 2005. Covers in Welsh A Welsh language cover of Santiana was recorded by Welsh folk singer Meic Stevens in 1969. It remained unreleased until 2002, when it was released on the Disgwyl Rhywbeth Gwell i Ddod compilation. Stevens' version of the song contains references to contemporary events in Wales such as the incarceration of Free Wales Army soldiers in 1969. This version has also inspired recent cover versions of the song by Alun Gaffey, Cowbois Rhos Botwnnog, Iwcs a Gaff and Alaw. Covers in other languages In 2008, German folk-collective Werkraum under leadership by Axel Frank recorded their own adaption of the English original using some changes in the verses, referring to Tory Island instead of Liverpool, probably inspired by a stormy cruise to the north-west coast of Ireland and the historical Irish immigration to America. In 2012, the German group Santiano recorded a new version of this song. The group has had much success, and received an Echo for their first album containing Santiano as well as other shanties. Metusa, a German Folk-Rock band, recorded a German version of this shanty called \\"Santyano\\" which appears on their album \\"Piratenseele\\". There is a Norwegian version of this song about a man who sails from Copenhagen to Kristiansand and meets a girl with whom he spends a night. He then has to travel to India and, when he arrives, he is handed a letter saying that his Norwegian friend is dead. He never returned to Norway for his Anna is dead. The song is remodeled by Storm Weather Shanty Choir. There is a version in Icelandic, called \\"Fulla fer√∞ Sant√≠an√≥\\" (\\"Full Ahead Santiano\\"), a seaman's story about sailing home after days at sea, written by Siggi Bj√∂rns an Icelandic musician and an ex- fisherman. This version was recorded and realised on a CD with a band called\\"√Üfing\\" from a small fishing town, Flateyri, in the Icelandic Westfjords.

At one time it was the only high school serving the city of St.Charles. Prior to moving to its current location in 1977, the high school was located in the middle of town at the corner of Main Street and Seventh Street, in the building that now serves as Thompson Middle School. The new St.Charles High School campus was built in the open fields to the east of Dunham Road, adjacent to the existing Norris Recreation Center and Dunham Junior High School (which educated 7th graders for the 1975‚Äì76 and 1976‚Äì77 school years before being annexed into the new High School campus for the 1977‚Äì78 school year). The campus change was not made without controversy ‚Äì the old downtown campus was an \\"open\\" campus that allowed the student body to depart and return during the school day, while the new campus is \\"closed\\". The first month in the new school featured student protests, leaky roofs, and problems with the school's (at the time) state-of-the-art solar heating system. The first class to graduate after attending all four years at the newly built high school was the class of 1981. In the year 2000, due to increasing population in the area, District 303 was split between two high schools, and St. Charles High School was renamed St. Charles East High School. (A new high school, \\"St. Charles North High School,\\" was built on the west side of town). The first class to graduate after attending all four years at the renamed school graduated in 2004. The Saint Charles East High School campus includes the Norris Cultural Arts Center, and the Norris Recreation Center. These facilities were established to serve not only the high school but the community as well. The Delora A. Norris Cultural Arts Center, a 1,000-seat performing arts theater and art gallery, was founded in 1978 with funding from the St. Charles Charities, which was created in 1924 by Lester and Delora Norris and Edward Baker. During spring break in 2001, a serious black mold problem was discovered at the campus (Stachybotrys and Aspergillus). It was believed to be the source of some student and teacher illnesses. In 2001 the building was shut down and the students remained on an extended spring break while officials struggled with the issue. For the rest of the 2001 school year, St. Charles East students shared a split-schedule with St. Charles North High School. East students attended class at the North campus during the morning, while North students went during the afternoon. During the summer of 2001 through the next school year, the school underwent an enormous renovation. For the entire 2001‚Äì2002 school year, the current students had to take classes in the adjacent Wredling Middle School building and mobile classrooms surrounding it (brought in specifically to accommodate the larger student body). Meanwhile, the Wredling Middle School students took classes in mobile classrooms parked in a field between Haines and Thompson Middle Schools. Classes resumed their normal locations and schedules the following school year (2002‚Äì2003).

He wore uniform number 65. As of 2018, Coleman was the NFL's longest current tenured referee. Officiating career=Early years Coleman worked for the Arkansas Activities Association, the governing body for high school athletics in Arkansas, for 14 years before moving up to the college level. His college officiating career included five years in the Southland Conference (Division I-AA) and five years in the Southwest Conference (Division I-A). He was never promoted to referee during his college officiating career since he could not justify heading a crew with his five years experience in each conference. National Football League Coleman served as a line judge for the first six seasons before being promoted to referee at the start of the 1995 NFL season when Dale Hamer was forced to sit out that season after undergoing open-heart surgery. Mike Carey had been promoted to referee when the NFL added another crew for the 1995 season in anticipation of the arrival of expansion franchises Carolina and Jacksonville. Coleman's NFL officiating crew in 2018, his final season, consisted of umpire Jeff Rice, down judge Jerry Bergman, line judge Mark Stewart, field judge Greg Gautreaux, side judge Jabir Walker, back judge Greg Yette, replay official Darryll Lewis, and replay assistant Saleem Choudhry.http://www.footballzebras.com/2018/07/06/officiating-crews-for- the-2018-season/ Coleman's final NFL game as referee was the 2019 Pro Bowl in Orlando, Florida, along with Pete Morelli. They both retired after that game.Referee Pete Morelli will retire after 22 seasons (Football Zebras) After his last regular-season game, which involved the Patriots, the team awarded Coleman a game ball.https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-keeps-losing-refs- with-pete-morelli-and-tuck-rule-referee-walt-coleman-set-to-retire/ Over his NFL career, Coleman worked two conference championship games (1998 and 2003) and was the alternate referee for Super Bowls XXXIV, XLII, and LI. =Notable games= Coleman made an instant replay call on January 19, 2002, in a game that led to its moniker as the \\"Tuck Rule Game\\". With 1:47 left, Oakland cornerback Charles Woodson knocked the ball from New England's quarterback Tom Brady. It was recovered by Oakland linebacker Greg Biekert. The play was originally called a fumble. Coleman reviewed the play and overturned the fumble call to an incomplete pass using the tuck rule, which says that \\"any intentional forward movement of [the thrower's] arm starts a forward pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body.\\" In March 2013, league owners voted 29‚Äì1, with Patriots owner Robert Kraft abstaining, to abolish the rule. Coleman never officiated another Raiders game the rest of his career. Coleman was the head official in the 2003 AFC Championship Game between the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts. Colts players later publicly complained that the officials did not properly call illegal contact, pass interference, and defensive holding penalties on the Patriots' defensive backs. This, and similar complaints made by other NFL teams during that season, would prompt the NFL during the 2004 offseason to instruct all of the league's officials to strictly enforce these types of fouls (the \\"chuck\\" rule). Coleman officiated the 2012 Thanksgiving Day game between the Houston Texans and Detroit Lions. Houston running back Justin Forsett ran in an 81-yard touchdown, but replays indicated that Forsett was down by contact after a short gain. Detroit head coach Jim Schwartz threw the challenge flag before he was entitled to, which negated the automatic review that would have overturned the call. Mike Pereira wrote that he would favor a rule change to make this just a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike behavior, but still allow the review. (That rule would eventually be passed.) Personal life Coleman resides in the Mabelvale neighborhood of Little Rock, Arkansas, and is the manager of Coleman Dairy, which dates back to the 1860s and was acquired by Hiland Dairy in 2007. Coleman's son, Walt Coleman IV, joined the NFL as an official in the 2015 season. His father, Walt \\"Buddy\\" Coleman II, refereed in the Southwest Conference. Coleman was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2009, joining his father, a 1994 inductee. Outside of officiating, Coleman serves on many local boards and associations including the Little Rock Boys and Girls Club and Greater Little Rock YMCA. Coleman is a former president of the Arkansas Dairy Products Association and Major Sports Association of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce.

In 1934, he topped the bill at the Holborn Empire but in the same year moved back to the Astoria Ballroom where he led a twelve piece band. In 1935, Vera Lynn appeared with the Joe Loss Orchestra in her first radio broadcast. With broadcasting, recording and annual tours in addition to the resident work the band became highly popular over the next few years. In the 1950s and early 60s, Loss was resident band leader at the Hammersmith Palais and was remembered by a trainee nurse at Hammersmith Hospital as being as kind and gentlemanly when she attended him in hospital as he was in his public persona. His band's signature tune \\"In the Mood\\" would often be requested three or more times a night. He was the subject of This Is Your Life on two occasions: in May 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews, and in October 1980, when Andrews surprised him again at London's Portman Hotel during a star-studded party to celebrate Joe's 50 years in show business. A favourite of the British Royal Family, Loss's orchestra performed not only at Royal Variety Performances but also at Christmas parties hosted by the Royal family, which earned Loss not only the OBE but also the LVO, an honour in the personal gift of the Queen.https://www.jmi.org.uk/event/joe-loss-quartet-barbican/ Loss's daughter Jennifer is the wife of British coach-builder Robert Jankel. Loss died on 6 June 1990 and is buried at Bushey Jewish Cemetery in Hertfordshire. Joe Loss Orchestra The Joe Loss Orchestra was one of the most successful acts of the big band era in the 1940s, with hits including \\"In the Mood\\". In 1961 they had a hit with \\"Wheels‚ÄîCha Cha\\", a version of the String-A-Longs' hit \\"Wheels\\". Other hits included David Rose's \\"The Stripper\\" in 1958, \\"Sucu Sucu\\", \\"Must Be Madison\\", \\"The Theme from Maigret\\" and \\"March of the Mods (The Finnjenka Dance)\\" of 1964. In April 1951 Elizabeth Batey, vocalist with Joe Loss, fell and broke her jaw. Joe was badly in need of a replacement and remembered hearing Rose Brennan on radio during a visit to Ireland. Within days he had located her and, before a week was out, she was in Manchester rehearsing with the band. She stayed with Loss for fifteen years, before giving up show-business in the mid 1960s. She wrote many of the songs she recorded with Joe Loss under the name Marella, and co-wrote songs with John Harris. Her co-vocalists with the orchestra from 1955 were Ross MacManus (father of Elvis Costello)Don Wicks: The Ballad Years. 1996 and Larry Gretton. The Joe Loss Orchestra carries on under the musical direction of Todd Miller, who was a vocalist with the band for 19 years before Loss's death. In 1989 Joe Loss became too ill to travel and in 1990 he entrusted the leadership to his longest serving band member, trombonist and player manager of many decades, Sam Watmough and to Todd. The orchestra has been in constant operation since 1930 and in 2015 it celebrated its 85th anniversary. Specialist dance band radio stations continue to play his records. Joe Loss also features regularly on the Manx Radio programme Sweet & Swing, presented by Howard Caine.

The company is based in Southern California and sells solid state relays and Ethernet-based input/output systems and controllers. It is based in Temecula, California. Opto 22 Headquarters in Temecula, CA USA  History  Opto 22 was founded in 1974 as a manufacturer of solid state relays. The company soon expanded its offerings to include a variety of computer-based industrial automation, remote monitoring, and data acquisition products. In 1978, Opto 22 developed the first computer-based plug-in I/O modules, and created the Yellow-Black-White-Red color scheme used to identify digital AC input, digital AC output, digital DC input, and digital DC output modules respectively. In 1982, the company created Optomux, a serial-based I/O system using the ASCII protocol. The following year, with the introduction of the personal computer prompting a shift in the automation industry to PC-based control, Opto 22 developed what was to be the first in a series of software packages for designing control strategies on a PC using flowcharts. This provided a new alternative to the more popular ladder logic programming model. Later, Opto 22 introduced the mistic controller, which had many of the same features and functionality of a modern programmable logic controller. Opto 22 markets the SNAP brand of Ethernet products, including industrial processors, controllers, I/O racks and modules, software and accessories. In 2007 the company introduced the SNAP PAC System, adding higher powered controllers with redundant Ethernet communications, new programming and human machine interface development software, higher density I/O modules, database connectivity tools and software that simulated the SNAP PAC controller hardware. The result was a suite of control system components, suitable for simple cell control or complex, distributed control architectures.

Its first book publication was in New York by Putnam in 1902; it was also published in Britain in Typhoon and Other Stories by Heinemann in 1903. Plot summary Typhoon is a classic sea yarn, possibly based upon Conrad's actual experience of seaman's life, and probably on a real incident aboard of the steamer John P. Best (according to the book by Jerry Allen on the \\"Sea years of Joseph Conrad\\", first published in 1965). The author of the mentioned book - an American journalist - did not reveal in her book any further details. Joseph Conrad himself described it as a \\"recent and much-discussed incident\\" (Author's note to the novella). The \\"Typhoon\\" describes how Captain MacWhirr sails the SS Nan-Shan, a British- built steamer running under the Siamese flag, into a typhoon‚Äîa mature tropical cyclone of the northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean. Other characters include the young Jukes - most probably an alter ego of Conrad from the time he had sailed under captain John McWhirr - and Solomon Rout, the chief engineer. The novella classically evokes the seafaring life at the turn of the century. While Macwhirr, who, according to Conrad, \\"never walked on this Earth\\" - is emotionally estranged from his family and crew, and though he refuses to consider an alternative course to skirt the typhoon, his indomitable will in the face of a superior natural force elicits grudging admiration. Characters * Captain Thomas MacWhirr, an empirical man without imagination. * Captain Wilson from \\"Melita\\", the \\"storm-strategist\\". * Jukes, the first mate (with no first name). * Jukes' absent friends - second mate Jack Allen and another mate from trans-Atlantic liner (addressee of Jukes' letter). * Solomon Rout, the chief engineer, an experienced seaman. * Second engineer Harry and third engineer Beale. * The boatswain. * The second mate. * Sailors, steward and cook of the \\"Nan-Shan\\". * The coolies, hired workers from India and China. * The clerk for Messrs. Bun-Hin Co. * Mrs. Lucy MacWhirr, the Captain's wife. * Lydia MacWhirr, the Captain's daughter and Tom MacWhirr, the Captain's son. * Mrs. Rout, the chief engineer's wife and the elder Mrs. Rout, the chief engineer's mother. * Messrs. Sigg and Son, the owners of the boat. * Owners and foremen (Mr. Mr. Bates and Tait) from the building yard.

F√ºrst) was a title attributed to a hereditary ruler, nobleman or prelate recognised as such by the Holy Roman Emperor. Definition Originally, possessors of the princely title bore it as immediate vassals of the Emperor who held a fief (secular or ecclesiastical) that had no suzerain except the Emperor. However, by the time the Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806, there were a number of holders of Imperial princely titles who did not meet these criteria. Thus, there were two main types of princes: those who exercised Landeshoheit (sovereignty within one's territory while respecting the laws and traditions of the empire) as well as an individual or shared vote in the College of Princes, and those whose title was honorary (the possessor lacking an immediate Imperial fief and/or a vote in the Imperial Diet). The first came to be reckoned as \\"royalty\\" in the sense of being treated as sovereigns, entitled to inter-marry with reigning dynasties. The second tier consisted of high- ranking nobles whose princely title did not, however, imply equality with royalty. These distinctions evolved within the Empire, but were codified by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 when it created the German Confederation and recognised a specific, elevated status (Standesherren or Mediatized Houses) for the mediatized princes of the defunct Empire. The actual titles used by Imperial nobles varied considerably for historical reasons, and included archdukes, dukes, margraves, landgraves, counts palatine, princely counts (Gef√ºrstete Grafen), as well as princes and prince-electors. Moreover, most of the German fiefs in the Empire (except electorships) were heritable by all males of a family rather than by primogeniture, the princely title (or whatever title the family used) being likewise shared by all agnatic family members, male and female. Imperial state The estate of imperial princes or Reichsf√ºrstenstandArnold, Benjamin (1991). Princes and territories in medieval Germany, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York, pp. 24-25, . was first established in a legal sense in the Late Middle Ages. A particular estate of \\"the Princes\\" was first mentioned in the decree issued by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1180 at the Imperial Diet of Gelnhausen, in which he divested Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony and Bavaria. About fifty years later, Eike of Repgow codified it as an emanation of feudal law recorded in his Sachsenspiegel, where the lay princes formed the third level or Heerschild in the feudal military structure below ecclesiastical princes. Officially the princely states of the Holy Roman Empire had to meet three requirements: * territorial rule and the droit de r√©gale, i.e. sovereign rights, over an immediate fief of the Empire * a direct vote (votum virile) and a seat in the Imperial Diet * direct support for the expenses and the military ban of the Empire. Not all states met all three requirements, so one may distinguish between effective and honorary princes of the Holy Roman Empire.Fra Cyril Toumanoff, \\"Genealogical Imperialism\\" (1985) vol 6 (no 134) (NS) Coat of Arms pp. 145, 147.Duke and Prince Jean Engelbert d'Arenberg, \\"The Lesser Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in the Napoleonic Era\\" dissertation, Washington, DC, 1950, published as Les Princes du St-Empire √† l'√©poque napol√©onienne (Louvain, 1951) 15ff, quoted in Almanach de Gotha (Almanach de Gotha, London, 1998) pp. 275‚Äì286. The Princes of the Empire ranked below the seven Prince-electors designated by the Golden Bull of 1356 (and later electors), but above the Reichsgrafen (Counts), Freiherren (barons) and Imperial prelates, who formed with them the Imperial Diet assemblies, but held only collective votes. About 1180 the secular Princes comprised the Herz√∂ge (Dukes) who generally ruled larger territories within the Empire in the tradition of the former German stem duchies, but also the Counts of Anhalt and Namur, the Landgraves of Thuringia and the Margraves of Meissen. Coat of arms of Hieronymus von Colloredo, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg From the 13th century onwards, further estates were formally raised to the princely status by the emperor. Among the most important of these were the Welf descendants of Henry the Lion in Brunswick-L√ºneburg, elevated to Princes of the Empire and vested with the ducal title by Emperor Frederick II in 1235, and the Landgraves of Hesse in 1292. The resolutions of the Diet of Augsburg in 1582 explicitly stated that the status was inextricably linked with the possession of a particular Imperial territory. Later elevated noble families like the F√ºrstenberg, Liechtenstein or Thurn und Taxis dynasties subsequently began to refer to their territory as a \\"principality\\" and assumed the awarded rank of a Prince (F√ºrst) as a hereditary title. Most of the Counts who ruled territories were raised to Princely rank in the decades before the end of the Empire in 1806. Grave of the Prince of the Holy Roman Empire Johann Siebenhirter (1420‚Äì1508) at the parish church in Millstatt, Austria Ecclesiastical Princes were the Prince-Bishops (including the Prince-Archbishops of Besan√ßon, Bremen, Magdeburg and Salzburg) as well as the actual Prince-abbots. They comprised a number of political entities which were secularized and mediatized after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, resp. fell to France or the independent Swiss Confederacy. Honorary title The honorary status of prince of the Holy Roman Empire might be granted to certain individuals. These individuals included: * Rulers of states of the Empire who did not hold an individual seat in the princely chamber of the Imperial Diet, but held a seat as a count and shared with other counts in the one vote exercised by each of the four regional comital councils or Grafenbanken. * Sovereigns outside the Empire, such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.Prince of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsf√ºrst) 1607, cf in 1620, Austrian prince (His Serene Highness) 27 December 1880, cf 1889 and 1905. Most Eminent Highness by Italian royal decree 1927 (long by usage).

A constant-speed propeller is a variable-pitch aircraft propeller that automatically changes its blade pitch in order to maintain a chosen rotational speed. The power delivered is proportional to the arithmetic product of rotational speed and torque (), and the propeller operation places emphasis on torque. The operation better suits modern engines, particularly supercharged and gas turbine types.  Operation  An aircraft propeller operates as the source of thrust that overcomes the drag acting on the aircraft. It can also partially overcome the aircraft weight, causing the aircraft to climb. When an aircraft is stationary with the propeller spinning (in calm air), air flows past the narrow leading edge of the propeller. This is the most efficient configuration, as the drag forces on the propeller are across its edge. As the airplane starts moving forward, the airflow begins to push against the front, wider cross section of the propeller, creating greater drag. A constant-speed propeller is able to partly rotate along the longest axis of the blade to take a larger bite of air with respect to the airplane, allowing the propeller to maintain the most efficient orientation to the airflow around it. This balances the tradeoff that fixed-pitch propellers must make between high takeoff performance and high cruise performance. A shallower angle of attack requires the least torque, but the highest RPM, because the propeller is not moving very much air with each revolution. This is similar to a car operating in low gear. When the motorist reaches cruising speed, they will slow down the engine by shifting into a higher gear, while still producing enough power to keep the vehicle moving. This is accomplished in an airplane by increasing the angle of attack of the propeller. This means that the propeller moves more air per revolution and allows the engine to spin slower while moving an equivalent volume of air, thus maintaining velocity. The first attempts at constant-speed propellers were called counterweight propellers, which were driven by mechanisms that operated on centrifugal force. Their operation is identical to the Watts governor used to limit the speed of steam and large diesel engines. Eccentric weights were set up near or in the spinner, held in by a spring. When the propeller reached a certain RPM, centrifugal force would cause the weights to swing outwards, which would drive a mechanism that twisted the propeller into a steeper pitch. When the propeller slowed, the RPM would decrease enough for the spring to push the weights back in, realigning the propeller to the shallower pitch. In newer models of constant-speed propellers, oil is pumped through the propeller shaft to push on a piston that drives the mechanism to change pitch. The flow of oil and the pitch are controlled by a governor, consisting of a speeder spring, flyweights, and a pilot valve. The tension of the speeder spring is set by the propeller control lever, which sets the RPM. The governor will maintain that RPM setting until an engine overspeed or underspeed condition exists. When an overspeed condition occurs, the propeller begins to rotate faster than the desired RPM setting. This would occur as the plane descends and airspeed increases. The flyweights begin to pull outward due to centrifugal force which further compresses the speeder spring. As that happens, the piston moves forward, allowing the pilot valve to open and oil to flow from the oil sump into the hub. This increase in oil pressure will increase the pitch of the propeller angle causing it to slow back down to the desired RPM setting. When an underspeed condition occurs, as in a climb with loss of airspeed, just the opposite takes place. The airspeed decreases, causing the propeller to slow down. This will cause the flyweights to move inward due to a lack in centrifugal force, and tension will be released from the speeder spring. As this happens, the piston will move in the opposite direction causing the pilot valve to allow oil to flow from the hub back to the oil sump. The propeller blade angle will now decrease to a lower pitch allowing the propeller to speed back up to the desired RPM setting. This process usually takes place frequently throughout flight. Virtually all high-performance propeller-driven aircraft have constant-speed propellers, as they greatly improve fuel efficiency and performance, especially at high altitude.  Constant-speed units  Pitch-change forces on a constant speed propeller. A constant-speed unit (CSU) or propeller governor is the device fitted to one of these propellers to automatically change its pitch so as to attempt to keep engine speed constant. Most engines produce their maximum power in a narrow speed band. The CSU can be said to be to an aircraft what the CVT is to the motorcar: the engine can be kept running at its optimum speed, no matter at what speed the aircraft is flying through the air. The advent of the CSU had another benefit: it allowed the designers of aircraft engines to keep ignition systems simple; the automatic spark advance seen in motor vehicle engines is simplified in aircraft engines. Three methods are used to vary the pitch. Engine oil pressure is the usual mechanism used in commercial aircraft and the Continental and Lycoming engines fitted to light aircraft. Alternatively, or additionally, centrifugal weights may be attached directly to the propeller as in the Yakovlev Yak-52. Small, modern engines with a CSU, such as the Rotax 912, may use either the traditional hydraulic method or an electrical pitch control mechanism. A pilot requires some additional training and, in most jurisdictions, a formal signoff before being allowed to fly aircraft fitted with a CSU. CSUs are not allowed to be fitted to aircraft certified under light-sport aircraft regulations in the United States.

It is an entertainment channel: although it broadcasts nationwide, most of the content on ERT3 is centred towards Northern Greece: consequently, ERT3 mainly broadcasts from Thessaloniki instead of the Broadcasting House in Athens, with regional studios in various cities in the north, including Florina, Komotini, Alexandroupoli and on the islands of Paros, Mytilene and Samos. History The channel launched as ET3 (, Ellinik√≠ Tile√≥rasi 3) on 14 December 1988, following the merger of state-owned TV and radio services into ERT, as a single entity. On 11 June 2013, the Greek coalition government (then with Antonis Samaras as Prime Minister) abolished ERT and attempted to close the Thessaloniki studio, but the station's employees continued to unofficially transmit ET3 via the Internet as part of the ERT Open movement, protesting the closure of public television and producing citizen journalism. Exactly two years later, the following coalition government (with Alexis Tsipras as Prime Minister instead) restored ERT as part of the counter-austerity measures: on the same day, ET3 adopted its current name and identity. The channel, under the new name ERT3, returned on all domestic television platforms.

Citizens passed a bond in 1909 to construct the high school building and a supplemental bond in 1911 to complete construction. Formal dedication of the original high school, located on Shoshone Street next to the Twin Falls County Courthouse, occurred in February 1912. The current Twin Falls High School on Filer Avenue opened in September 1954. The original high school building became Twin Falls Junior High School (now O'Leary Middle School). The original building was condemned and torn down in the early 1980s after O'Leary moved to a new location in 1979. Athletics Until 2009, TFHS was among the largest high schools in the state, classified as 5A (enrollment over 1,280 students) by the IHSAA. With the opening of Canyon Ridge High School in western Twin Falls in August 2009, both schools were classified as 4A (four-year enrollment between 640 and 1,279).IDHSAA School Information A crosstown rivalry between TFHS and CRHS has since developed.Twin Falls-Canyon Ridge Rivalry (accessed 24 December 2011) With the move to down to 4A in 2009, TFHS also changed conferences. It is currently a member of the Great Basin (West) Conference, competing against Canyon Ridge, Burley, Jerome, Minico, and Wood River, all located in south central Idaho's Magic Valley.Hicks is here CRHS football coach meets players Twin Falls won the 5A state championship in football in 2004 and in boys' basketball in 2006. After dropping to Class 4A, the Bruins won the boys' state basketball championship in 2010, and the state baseball championship in 2011 and 2014. The water polo team and bowling team won state championships in 2007. The boys' cross country has won three state titles in a row since 2007, and both golf teams have won many state titles, as well. The Bruin track team won many championships in the 1970s and continue to be a state power. The last state team track championship was in 1997.

The squadron, known as the \\"Greyhawks\\", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). The squadron has the distinction of being the first helicopter transport squadron in the world.Kristy, \\"Museum Preserves 60 Years of Marine Corps Rotary Wing Aviation\\", Fortitudine, 2007. History=Korean War The squadron was commissioned on January 15, 1951 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California, as Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron 161 (HMR-161), Air Fleet Marine Force Pacific. The squadron moved a month later to Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana, California to train on their new helicopter, the Sikorsky HRS-1. Except for the commanding officer, LtCol George Herring, most pilots in the squadron had flown fighters during World War II. In August 1951 the squadron deployed to Korea and attached to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1 MAW), where it operated in the central and the western fronts. USS Sicily in September 1952. After becoming the first helicopter squadron to deploy troops into combat, HMR-161 successfully flew from the USS Sicily (CVE-118) to test new concept of combining vertical envelopment with amphibious assault during Operation \\"Marlex-5\\" off the coast of Inchon on September 1, 1952. While not the first ever ship to shore helicopter flight with Marines aboard, that having been done by HMR-162 during Operation Lex Baker off the coast of Southern California in February, 1952, it was the first on foreign shores. During the course of the Korean War, HMR-161 flew 16,538 hours during 18,607 sorties eventually accounting for over 60,000 troop movements and moving 7.5 million pounds of cargo. The Greyhawks then participated in the defense of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from July 1953 to March 1955. The Squadron then relocated that month to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and attached to Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG 13). While in Hawaii, HMR-161 was redesignated on December 31, 1956 as Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron (Light) 161 (HMR(L)-161), MAG 13, 1st MAW. In May 1960, the Squadron received the new Sikorsky H-34 Seahorse. On February 1, 1962, the unit was once again re-designated as Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161 (HMM-161), MAG 13, 1st Marine Brigade. On October 3, 1962 the Greyhawks assisted NASA by recovering astronaut Wally Schirra and his Mercury Capsule \\"Friendship Seven\\" out of the Pacific after a successful launch into space. During 1963, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 161 (HMM-161) assisted in several biological warfare tests conducted under Project SHAD at Pearl Harbor, Kaneohe Naval Air Station and in the Pacific Ocean, near Oahu, Hawaii. The rest of the early 1960s were spent conducting anti-guerrilla training in preparation for deployment to Vietnam.  Vietnam War and the 1980s  A helicopter from HMM-161 waiting to transport prisoners just south of Chu Lai during Operation Starlite in 1965. HMM-161 deployed in May 1965 to Phu Bai Combat Base, Republic of Vietnam and attached to MAG-16, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. It then relocated in January 1966 to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa to receive its new Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight. By April 1966, the Greyhawks had redeployed to Da Nang, Republic of Vietnam with a move to Phu Bai that June. On September 25, 1966 a UH-34D HUS from HMM-161 was struck by a friendly artillery shell while conducting a medevac mission during Operation Prairie resulting in the death all five Marines on board. It is the only known case of friendly artillery fire shooting down an American helicopter during the war. The squadron relocated once again in November 1966 to Futenma, Okinawa, where it was attached to Marine Aircraft Group 15 (MAG-15), 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade. A month later the Greyhawks returned to CONUS, as they were attached to Marine Aircraft Group 26 (MAG-26), 2d MAW at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. HMM-161 then redeployed in May 1968 to Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Combat Base, Republic of Vietnam and attached to provisional Marine Aircraft Group 39 (MAG-39), 1st MAW. The Squadron finished its Vietnam years with its final deployment to Phu Bai in October 1969 while attached to MAG-16, 1st MAW. HMM-161 came home in September 1970 and attached to MAG-56, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, Fleet Marine Force Pacific. It was reassigned in July 1971 to MAG-16, 3d MAW. Elements of the Squadron participated in the August 1989 cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska. CH-46E  The Gulf War and the 1990s  Old HMM-161 insignia. In 1990 they deployed on August 17 to Saudi Arabia as part of MAG-70, 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade in support of Operation Desert Shield. The squadron would eventually participate in Operation Desert Storm in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In 1995, they participated in Operation United Shield, the withdrawal of United Nations Forces from Somalia. By the end of the year, the unit had relocated to MCAS El Toro, California. In 1997, the Greyhawks deployed in March aboard the USS Boxer to the WESTPAC and Persian Gulf as the ACE for the 15th MEU(SOC), where they flew missions in support of Operation Southern Watch in Iraq. In February 1999, HMM-161 moved from MCAS El Toro to MCAS Miramar, California. Global War on Terror The new millennium began well for the Squadron, as it won the Edward C. Dyer Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron of the Year for 2001. This followed the 2000 WESTPAC Deployment, which saw the Greyhawks provide humanitarian assistance in East Timor. On January 6, 2003, HMM-161 (Rein) deployed as a part of the 15th MEU for a WESTPAC Float that would end up supporting Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Greyhawks were assigned the mission of Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP). Although no TRAP missions were necessary during the OIF, the Squadron did fly Casevac and numerous other missions. The Squadron returned home to MCAS Miramar on July 12, 2003. In November 2003, Marines of HMM-161 were told they would be redeploying to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom II (OIF II). Immediate preparations were begun, and the Squadron used its December deployment to Indian Springs, Nevada to train for the conditions that would be faced during OIF II. While at Indian Springs, the Marines of HMM-161 made their mark in Squadron history by surpassing the 40,000 mishap-free flight hours plateau. This climb into the history books began back in August 1995 and culminated with a ground crew appreciation flight over the Hoover Dam and the Las Vegas Strip. After receiving its cargo and aircraft at Ash Shu'aybah Port, Kuwait, the Squadron flew up to Al Taqaddum, Iraq during the first week of March to set up for the relief in place with the 82nd Airborne Brigade. The Squadron made 752 consecutive mission launches in support of I MEF operations during OIF II, logging 3072.8 hours of flight time. The Greyhawks were relieved on September 1, 2004 by HMM-268 with the main body arriving back at MCAS Miramar on September 6. Throughout their service during OIF II, the Greyhawks moved 116,480 pounds of cargo and 2,929 passengers, including 328 patients that needed urgent care. HMM-161 Phrog painted for squadron's 55th Anniversary celebrated in Iraq on January 15, 2006. In August 2005, the squadron redeployed to Iraq for its third OIF deployment. The Greyhawks provided around-the-clock casualty evacuation and assault support in Al Anbar Province. During this deployment, the squadron flew 5,199 combat flight hours, transported more than 2,100 wounded personnel and conducted 19 raids and assault support missions that led to the capture of numerous insurgents. The Greyhawks safely completing 2,999 assault support requests without mishap or damage from enemy action. On February 8, 2006, HMM-161 marked their 50,000th flight hour without a Class \\"A\\" mishap during their latest deployment to Al Taqaddum, Iraq. During this time period, which began February 19, 1995, the squadron flew 9,100 combat hours during three combat deployments. The squadron returned from its third OIF deployment on March 4, 2006. Following the deployment the squadron was awarded its fourth consecutive Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award and the Marine Corps Aviation Association's 2006 Commandant's Aviation Award in recognition as the year's best overall performance by a Marine squadron. On February 3, 2007, HMM-161 embarked upon its fourth combat deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the Global War on Terror by sending a small advance party back to Al Taqaddum, Iraq to prepare for the arrival of the Squadron's Main Body on March 1. The Greyhawks officially resumed their role in Casualty Evacuations and General Support on March 9, 2007. On September 24, HMM-161 returned from Al Taqaddum, Iraq, with their CASEVAC bell, the symbol of their mission in the area. They took the bell with them instead of leaving it for the next squadron because the mission of CASEVAC had been temporarily turned over to the soldiers of an Army Blackhawk detachment on the same base.Hammel, \\"HMM-161 flies 50,000th safe hour in Iraq\\", Marine Corps News, 2006. As of the end of the deployment, the squadron is at a record of over 58,000 class A mishap free flight hours total. This achievement is unable to be surpassed by any other CH-46E squadron due to the fact the new MV-22 Osprey will be replacing the CH-46E, and no other squadron has a record close enough to the Greyhawks' that they would be able to beat it. In December 2009, HMM-161 became the first of ten west coast squadrons to transition to the MV-22 Osprey and changed their name to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 161 during the change of command.‚ÄòGreyhawks‚Äô celebrate history In May 2017, VMM-161 lost an Osprey in an accident in Hawaii.

Members learn about the mechanics of government, such as parliamentary procedure, decision making, and the rules of debate in a parliamentary democracy. Additionally, members are exposed to a variety of viewpoints from youth from around Saskatchewan. At its annual Christmas session, SYP members are given the privilege of debating at the Saskatchewan Legislature in Regina, in the same seats as the real Members of the Legislative Assembly. SYP is run for youth by youth by a cabinet elected at the Annual Christmas Session each year. Cabinet does everything from planning the events, to finances and communications. According to its mission statement: > The Saskatchewan Youth Parliament is a non-partisan, not-for-profit, youth- > run organization. SYP provides the opportunity for youth across the province > to expand their knowledge of parliamentary procedure while fostering good > citizenship. The organization is dedicated to developing leadership and > public speaking skills among youth. While striving to create an inclusive > environment, members forge lasting relationships based on cooperative > learning and mutual respect. History SYP first met in 1912 as the Saskatchewan Older Boys' Parliament. However, it had a shaky beginning and collapsed after a few years of existence. In 1923, SYP was revived under the TUXIS movement as an organisation for Christian boys. That Christmas, the session was held at the Saskatchewan Legislature, where it has been held almost every year since. There were no sessions of the SYP during the Great Depression and World War II. This resulted in a fifteen year gap between the 8th and 9th sessions of the SYP. It was not until 1945 that the SYP met again. At that time, the Saskatchewan Older Boys' Parliament began its evolution towards what is now called SYP. There were many spirited debates on whether to admit females, non- Christians and smokers. The members at the time decided to allow smokers to join but not females or non-Christians. In 1969, the members of the Saskatchewan Older Boys' Parliament debated a resolution that would permit young women to join the organisation. One of the members at the time was former Saskatchewan premier Lorne Calvert, who gave a (reportedly tongue in cheek) speech against admitting female members. It was not until 1972 that females and non-Christians were allowed to join. At that time, the name was changed to Saskatchewan Youth Parliament. In 1987, SYP celebrated its 75th Anniversary. To celebrate, a reunion was held which brought together different generations of SYP alumni. Soon afterward, a new draft constitution and standing orders were prepared. These came into effect in 1988. In 2012, SYP celebrated its 100th Anniversary with a special reunion in Regina at the Saskatchewan Legislative Building, being the first people in Saskatchewan to use the new green carpet that had been installed in the legislative chamber. Throughout the years, a number of SYP alumni have become notable political leaders, including former Prime Minister the Right Honourable John Diefenbaker; former Clerk of the Legislature, Clerk of the Senate, Secretary of the University of Saskatchewan, Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan, and former acting President of the University of Saskatchewan, His Honour, the Honourable Dr. Gordon Barnhart; former MP Simon De Jong; former Federal Cabinet Minister and current Deputy Leader of the Opposition Ralph Goodale; former Premier Lorne Calvert; former MLA and cabinet minister Mark Wartman; and Minister of Environment Ken Cheveldayoff. Many other former members have also made their mark on Saskatchewan and Canada as lawyers, diplomats, teachers, and journalists. Annual events SYP has four events each year, the biggest being the Annual Christmas Session in Regina, Saskatchewan. At Session the members take part in a number of activities, which include debate of resolutions in the Saskatchewan Legislature, a formal dinner with the Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan, and cabinet elections. Session is also the opportunity for the organization to debate legislation that affects the operation of the organization, including the annual budget and the acts governing each cabinet portfolio. Session functions as SYP's annual general meeting, and outcomes of legislation debates are binding on the organization. The topics for debate are chosen by the members themselves at the event and are often related to topics that are of interest or are featured in the news. For example, switching to a nuclear-based energy system was a favourite debate resolution during the early 1990s. Other perennial topics include the death penalty, abortion, and the legalization of marijuana. The three other events held throughout the year take place in March, May and November. These are called \\"Minis\\" because each is held over a weekend is like a miniature Session. The location of the March and May minis vary each year, but tend to be either a North/South town or city or an East/West town or city. Mini debates are of resolutions and not SYP's legislation. The November Mini is typically held in Saskatoon and is the yearly Tri-Provincial event. Saskatchewan Youth Parliament invites the Youth Parliament of Manitoba and the TUXIS Parliament of Alberta to join them in a weekend of debating. There are also Cabinet meetings held in January, July and September, as well as at each official event as a time for the Executive Council (Cabinet) to discuss the running of Saskatchewan Youth Parliament. There is also an annual Board meeting of the Chief Returning Officer, Premier and other board members, which includes a report from the Minister of Finance.

The screenplay, written by Reginald Rose, is based on the 1955 novel The Border Jumpers, by Will C. Brown. The film co-stars Julie London, Jack Lord, Arthur O'Connell and Lee J. Cobb in supporting roles. The film is one of Cooper's final western roles. Former outlaw Link Jones (Cooper) travels from his small town to Crosscut Texas to catch a train to Fort Worth to hire the town's first schoolteacher. When his train stops for fueling on the way, they are set upon by armed robbers but the train escapes leaving behind Jones, the fast-talking gambler Sam Beasley (O'Connell) and saloon singer Billie Ellis (London). They start walking and eventually reach a place that Link knows well: the farmhouse where he once lived. There he finds the men who robbed the train and their leader, his uncle, Dock Tobin (Cobb), who wants Link to return to his old ways and re-join the gang, which consists of some of Link's cousins. Link has no interest in doing so and has to find a way out for himself and his two companions, knowing the gang are untrustworthy killers. The film premiered on October 1, 1958. At the time of release, the film was largely panned by American critics, but it was praised by Jean-Luc Godard, who, before he became a director, was a film critic. Godard claimed that Man of the West was the best film of the year. Decades after the film's release, it has gained a cult following and greater acclaim, with film historian Philip French claiming the film to be Anthony Mann's masterpiece, containing Cooper's finest performance. Plot Link Jones (Gary Cooper) rides into Crosscut, Texas to have a bite to eat, then catch a train to Fort Worth, where he intends to use the savings of his community of Good Hope to hire a schoolteacher. On the train platform, Sam Beasley (Arthur O'Connell) speaks with Link briefly, rousing the suspicions of the town marshal, Sam being a known gambler and con man. When the marshal comments that Link looks familiar, Link gives him a false name Henry Wright. Aboard the train, Sam joins Link, learns of his mission in Fort Worth and claims he can be of help. Sam introduces him to the Crosscut saloon singer, Billie Ellis (Julie London), insisting she could make an ideal teacher. Their conversation is overheard by Alcutt, a shady-looking passenger. When the train stops to pick up wood for additional fuel, male passengers help load the train but Alcutt remains on board, feigning sleep. From a window, he signals three horsemen, Coaley Tobin (Jack Lord), Trout (Royal Dano) and Ponch (Robert J. Wilke), who attempt to rob the train. The armed guard on the train thwarts the attempt. Link tries to intervene and is knocked unconscious. The train pulls away, with Alcutt riding off with Link's bag containing Good Hope's money. Alcutt is wounded as he and the three other robbers flee. Link revives to discover that he, Sam and Billie have been left behind, many miles from the nearest town. Link leads them on foot to a ramshackle farm, admitting that he lived there years earlier. Link sends the others to wait in the barn, given Billie his coat to wear. Link enters the run-down house and finds the train robbers hiding inside. Coaley is suspicious of Link's claim that he simply wants to rest for the night. They are interrupted by aging outlaw Dock Tobin (Lee J. Cobb), who is startled to see Link, his nephew, whom he raised to be a killer and a thief. More than a dozen years earlier, in order to go straight, Link abandoned Tobin and the old man laments that nothing has been the same since. He introduces Link to the others, including Link's cousin, Coaley. Disturbed by the revelation of Link's true identity, Coaley demonstrates his toughness by shooting Alcutt, who is near death from his wound. Realizing the danger of his situation, Link brings Sam and Billie in from the barn and lies to Tobin, telling him that Billie is his woman and also that he purposely set out to find Dock after being left behind by the train. Tobin reveals his long-held ambition to rob the bank in the town of Lassoo and asserts that Link's return to the gang makes that possible and will breathe new life into them all. In order to protect the lives of his companions, Link agrees to participate in the holdup. After Link and Sam are sent outside to dig a grave and bury Alcutt, an increasingly drunken Coaley decides to force Billie to strip. Her cries alert Link and, when he returns to the cabin, Coaley holds a knife to his throat while continuing to demand Billie remove her clothes. When she is nearly undressed, Tobin steps in and ends the situation. He tells everyone to go to sleep and sends Link and Billie to sleep in the barn. Claude Tobin (John Dehner), another cousin, arrives the next morning and is displeased at finding Link there. Tobin rejects the suggestion of Claude and Coaley that it would be best to kill Link and the others. They all depart on the four-day trip to Lassoo in three wagons and two on horseback. When they make camp on the trail, Link seeks revenge for the brutal treatment of Billie at the ranch and goads the brutal Coaley into a fistfight. Link beats his cousin severely, then forcibly strips him of his clothes. Deeply humiliated, Coaley attempts to shoot the unarmed Link, but Sam interferes and is shot instead. Tobin then shoots Coaley for disobeying him. During the trip, Billie bemoans the fact that Link is a man worth loving but that she cannot have him. He says he has a wife and two children in Good Hope. Gary Cooper With the town of Lassoo in sight, Link volunteers to go in and do the holdup job, secretly hoping that in town he can seek help. Tobin insists that he be accompanied by the mute Trout. It turns out that Lassoo is a ghost town, its bank deserted except for a frightened Mexican woman who has the two at gunpoint when Trout coldly shoots her. Link uses the woman‚Äôs gun to kill Trout. He then awaits the arrival of Claude and Ponch. In a drawn-out gun battle, Link kills Ponch first, then eventually and with some regret - because as children the two of them had been fairly close - Claude. Returning to camp, Link discovers to his horror that Billie has been raped and beaten. He goes in search of Tobin, who is on a cliff nearby. Link calls out to his uncle that he, like Lassoo, is a ghost and is finished. Tobin is ranting and starts firing his gun and Link finally shoots Tobin and reclaims the bag of Good Hope's money. Riding back to civilization, Billie tells Link she loves him but, knowing that he intends to return to his home and his family, she is resigned to the fact that she must resume her singing career and proceed alone.

Production=Development The script of the film which was written by Reginald Rose (best known for writing 12 Angry Men (1957)), was based on the 1955 novel The Border Jumpers by Will C. Brown. The title of the film had nothing to do with the novel entitled Man of the West, which was written by screenwriter Philip Yordan. Yordan's novel had been adapted into a film called Gun Glory, which starred Stewart Granger in the lead role. The producer of the film, Walter Mirisch (whose company produced the Academy Award-nominated films: The Magnificent Seven (1960), West Side Story (1961), The Great Escape (1963) and In the Heat of the Night (1967)), assigned director Anthony Mann to direct an adaptation of the film. Casting Stewart Granger was originally considered for the lead role. James Stewart, who had worked with director Anthony Mann in eight movies, five of them westerns: Winchester '73 (1950), Bend of the River (1952), The Naked Spur (1953), The Far Country (1954) and The Man from Laramie (1955), eagerly wanted the role. Supposedly, Stewart was extremely upset when Mann didn't give him the script for the film, felt betrayed, and had no interest in working with him ever again, although Mann thought that Stewart would be unfit for the role. Another probable reason why Mann didn't give Stewart the script was that Mann and Stewart had a falling out during the shooting of Night Passage (1957). While Mann and Stewart felt that the script of the film need some rewrites, Mann wanted a darker edge for the main character of the film and dropped out of the film because Stewart softened up the character and sang a few songs in the final film, as a showcase for his own accordion playing. With Mann out of the picture, James Neilson took over his position as director. Gary Cooper was eventually cast for the lead role of Link Jones, a former outlaw who is forced to relive his past. This was Cooper's first true western since 1954's Vera Cruz. He initially felt that he was miscast in the role of the former outlaw because he was twenty years older than the character; Cooper was 56 at the time of filming, the lead character being 36. However, in an interview at the 2008 Cinecon in Hollywood, Mirisch claimed that having just wrapped Love in the Afternoon, he promptly signed Cooper for another picture, which ended up being this one. He stated that they hadn't even considered a director yet, so Stewart was never a factor. According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, Cooper, who struggled with moral conflicts in his personal life, \\"understood the anguish of a character striving to retain his integrity ... [and] brought authentic feeling to the role of a tempted and tormented, yet essentially decent man.\\" Lee J. Cobb (who had starred in 12 Angry Men as one of the twelve jurors) played the role of Dock Tobin, the uncle of Link, who wants his nephew to return to his old ways and rejoin his gang. Despite playing the uncle of the main character, Cobb was ten years younger than Cooper. Makeup was applied to make Cobb look older than Cooper. The main villain of the film, Tobin wants his nephew to return to his old ways and rejoin his gang. This was the same case with John Dehner who played Link's cousin and childhood friend, Claude. Denher was fourteen years younger than Cooper. Arthur O'Connell played Sam Beasley, a fast-talking gambler, and saloon singer Billie Ellis was played by Julie London. London said this was her favorite movie. Tobin's henchmen Coaley, Trout and Ponch (who rob the train) were played by Jack Lord, Royal Dano and Robert J. Wilke respectively. J. Williams played Alcutt, one of the passengers on the train and Chief Tahachee was cast as Pio. Joe Dominguez, Dick Elliott, Frank Ferguson, Herman and Signe Hack, Anne Kunde, Tom London, Tina Menard, Emory Parnell, Chuck Roberson, Glen Walters and Glen Wilkerson play minor roles in the film and are uncredited. Filming Principal photography of Man of the West started and ended in 1958, with a budget of $1.5 million. The film was shot on the widescreen CinemaScope process (which was introduced in 1953) by cinematographer Ernest Haller, who is best known for his Academy Award-winning work in Gone with the Wind. Although the film takes place in Texas, most of the film was shot in California. The train scenes were shot on Sierra Railroad, Jamestown, California. The Red Rock Canyon State Park, Santa Clarita, Thousand Oaks, Newhall and the Mojave Desert all served as filming locations for the film. Two ranches located on Newhall and Thousand Oaks respectively were used as sets which were designed by art director Hilyard M. Brown, best known for his work in Cleopatra (for which he won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction), Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Night of the Hunter. Gary Cooper did his own horse-riding scenes despite physical pain that he suffered from a car accident years earlier. Chuck Roberson, Jack Williams and Jack N. Young were the stunt performers for the film. During a snow storm, Mann observed Cooper's eyes, which fascinated him: \\"It's all in the eyes. The heroes, all the stars the public loves, have very light blue eyes or green eyes....The eyes reflect the inner flame that animates the heroes. The guys with dark eyes play supporting roles or become character actors.\\" Themes Canadian film critic Robin Wood noted that Man of the West is director Anthony Mann's version of William Shakespeare's play King Lear, whose elements appeared in The Furies, The Naked Spur and The Man From Laramie, with its sense of emotional whirlwind, and an older order crumbling. Man of the West, like most Mann films, is a tale of redemption. We are asked to consider the essential monstrousness of the hero, and whether redemption is a tenable idea. The noble frontiersman is made the Other, and one not very deserving of sympathy, a savage whose past ghoulishness seems unimaginable. Wood also noted that the film looks down the road to the contemporary horror film: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974) and The Hills Have Eyes (Wes Craven, 1977), with their savage clans and desiccated American wasteland, are not far away. Reception When first released, the film was largely ignored by American critics, though renowned French critic Jean-Luc Godard regarded it as the best film released that year. Howard Thompson, in The New York Times, gave it one of the few raves in the mainstream press. In the decades since the film's release, it has garnered a cult following as well as considerably greater acclaim. Some, such as The Guardian's Derek Malcolm consider the film Mann's best and a landmark in the western genre's canon. Malcolm included the film in his 2000 list The Century of Film. Critic and film historian Philip French cites Man of the West as Anthony Mann's masterpiece, containing Gary Cooper's greatest performance. Paul Mavis, for Movies & Drinks' review of the 2014 Kino Lorber Blu-ray release, wrote, \\"over 60 years later, Man of the West is still a hammer-blow experience.\\" As of 2015, Man of the West maintains a rare 100% approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes film website, based on reviews from 13 critics. \\"Morally objectionable\\" The trade publication Motion Picture Daily reported in 1958 that the National Legion of Decency objected to the content of Man of the West. In its October 3 issue, just two days after the film's release, the daily magazine provides a few examples of the Legion's classification system for judging a Hollywood production's level of \\"decency\\": References=See also * List of American films of 1958 External links  * * Trailer for Man of the West at Internet Archive Category:1958 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:United Artists films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on Western (genre) novels Category:Films directed by Anthony Mann Category:Films produced by Walter Mirisch Category:Films set in ghost towns Category:American Western (genre) films Category:1958 Western (genre) films Category:Films with screenplays by Reginald Rose Category:Films scored by Leigh Harline Category:Films shot in California ","title":"Man of the West"},{"id":"3755309","text":"Isopropyl acetate is an ester, an organic compound which is the product of esterification of acetic acid and isopropanol.

Overview  A version of the Golden Driller was originally built in 1952 by the Mid-Continent Supply Company of Fort Worth as a temporary feature of the International Petroleum Exposition. Six years later, one was erected again for the 1959 show. Due to the positive attention it attracted, the company donated the statue to the Tulsa County Fairgrounds Trust Authority which had it anatomically redesigned http://www.tulsagal.net/2010/10/golden-driller.html and permanently installed in front of the Tulsa Expo Center for the 1966 International Petroleum Exposition. The statue's right hand rests on an oil derrick which had been moved from a depleted oil field in Seminole, Oklahoma. An inscription at the base of the statue reads: \\"The Golden Driller, a symbol of the International Petroleum Exposition.

In geography, a confluence (also: conflux) (and is pronounced kuhn-floo-ence) occurs where two or more flowing bodies of water join together to form a single channel. A confluence can occur in several configurations: at the point where a tributary joins a larger river (main stem); or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name (such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers at Pittsburgh, forming the Ohio); or where two separated channels of a river (forming a river island) rejoin at the downstream end. Scientific study of confluences Confluences are studied in a variety of sciences. Hydrology studies the characteristic flow patterns of confluences and how they give rise to patterns of erosion, bars, and scour pools.A widely cited work is James L. Best (1986) The morphology of river channel confluences. Progress in Physical Geography 10:157‚Äì174. For work citing Best, see . The water flows and their consequences are often studied with mathematical models.A recent contribution with review of earlier work is Laurent Schindfessel, St√©phan Cre√´lle and Tom De Mulder (2015) \\"Flow patterns in an open channel confluence with increasingly dominant tributary inflow,\\" Water 7: 4724‚Äì4751; available on line. Confluences are relevant to the distribution of living organisms (i.e., ecology) as well; \\"the general pattern [downstream of confluences] of increasing stream flow and decreasing slopes drives a corresponding shift in habitat characteristics.\\"Quoted from Beechie et al. (2012), who cite earlier work. Tim Beechie, John S. Richardson, Angela M. Gurnell, and Junjiro Negishi (2012) \\"Watershed processes, human impacts, and process-based restoration.\\" In Philip Roni and Tim Beechie (eds.) (2012) Stream and Watershed Restoration: A Guide to Restoring Riverine Processes and Habitats, John Wiley & Sons. Excerpts available on line at Google Books. Another science relevant to the study of confluences is chemistry, because sometimes the mixing of the waters of two streams triggers a chemical reaction, particularly in a polluted stream. The United States Geological Survey gives an example: \\"chemical changes occur when a stream contaminated with acid mine drainage combines with a stream with near-neutral pH water; these reactions happen very rapidly and influence the subsequent transport of metals downstream of the mixing zone.\\"U.S. Geological Survey, \\"How do contaminants mix at the confluence of two streams?\\", on line at . A natural phenomenon at confluences that is obvious even to casual observers is a difference in color between the two streams; see images in this article for several examples. According to Lynch, \\"the color of each river is determined by many things: type and amount of vegetation in the watershed, geological properties, dissolved chemicals, sediments and biologic content ‚Äì usually algae.\\" Lynch also notes that color differences can persist for miles downstream before they finally blend completely.David Lynch (2014) \\"The Confluence of Rivers\\"; Earth Science Picture of the Day, at .  River confluence flow zones  Hydrodynamic features of a river/flume confluence can be separated into six identifiable distinct zones, also called confluence flow zones. Hydrodynamic behaviour of flow in a confluence can be divided into six distinct features which are commonly called confluence flow zones (CFZ). These include # Stagnation zone # Flow deflection zone # Flow separation zone / recirculation zone # Maximum velocity zone # Flow recovery zone # Shear layers Confluences and mankind The fountain at Point State Park in Pittsburgh, at the apex of the confluence of the Allegheny (top) and the Monongahela Since rivers often serve as political boundaries, confluences sometimes demarcate three abutting political entities, such as nations, states, or provinces, forming a tripoint. Various examples are found in the list below. A number of major cities, such as Chongqing, St. Louis, and Khartoum, arose at confluences; further examples appear in the list. Within a city, a confluence often forms a visually prominent point, so that confluences are sometimes chosen as the site of prominent public buildings or monuments, as in Koblenz, Lyon, and Winnipeg. Cities also often build parks at confluences, sometimes as projects of municipal improvement, as at Portland and Pittsburgh. In other cases, a confluence is an industrial site, as in Philadelphia or Mannheim. Often a confluence lies in the shared floodplain of the two rivers and nothing is built on it, for example at Manaus, described below. One other way that confluences may be exploited by humans is as sacred places in religions. Rogers suggests that for the ancient peoples of the Iron Age in northwest Europe, watery locations were often sacred, especially sources and confluences.Rogers, Adam (2011) Late Roman Towns in Britain: Rethinking Change and Decline. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 42. Excerpts available on line at Google Books. Pre-Christian Slavic peoples chose confluences as the sites for fortified triangular temples, where they practiced human sacrifice and other sacred rites.Gasparini, Evel (n.d.) \\"Slavic religion\\", in Encyclopedia Britannica, on line edition: In Hinduism, the confluence of two sacred rivers often is a pilgrimage site for ritual bathing.Source: Letizia (2017), who writes, \\"as rivers are considered holy entities, at the meeting of two streams the 'sacredness' of the first river add to that of the second one. The confluence seems to have a sort of 'additive fame' ... because it gives pilgrims the chance to bathe in two rivers at the same time.\\" In Pittsburgh, a number of adherents to Mayanism consider their city's confluence to be sacred.Ann Rodgers, \\"So how did the Point get on a Mayan calendar?\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 22, 2008.

Pleomorphism has been observed in some members of the Deinococcaceae family of bacteria. The modern definition of pleomorphism in the context of bacteriology is based on variation of morphology or functional methods of the individual cell, rather than a heritable change of these characters as previously believed. Bacteria In the first decades of the 20th century, the term \\"pleomorphism\\" was used to refer to the idea that bacteria change morphology, biological systems, or reproductive methods dramatically according to environmental cues. This claim was controversial among microbiologists of the time, and split them into two schools: the monomorphists, who opposed the claim, and the pleomorphists such as Antoine B√©champ, Ernst Almquist, G√ºnther Enderlein, Albert Calmette, Gastons Naessens, Royal Raymond Rife, and Lida Mattman, who supported the posit. According to a 1997 journal article by Milton Wainwright, a British microbiologist, pleomorphism of bacteria lacked wide acceptance among modern microbiologists of the time. Helicobacter pylori in curved rod form Monomorphic theory, supported by Louis Pasteur, Rudolf Virchow, Ferdinand Cohn, and Robert Koch, emerged to become the dominant paradigm in modern medical science: it is now almost universally accepted that each bacterial cell is derived from a previously existing cell of practically the same size and shape. However it has recently been shown that certain bacteria are capable of dramatically changing shape. Sergei Winogradsky took a middle-ground stance in the pleomorphism controversy. He agreed with the monomorphic school of thought, but disagreed with some of the foundational microbiological beliefs that the prominent monomorphists Cohn and Koch held. Winogradsky published a literature review titled \\"The Doctrine of Pleomorphism in Bacteriology\\" in which he attempted to explicate the pleomorphic debate, identifying the fundamental errors within each side's argument. Winogradsky posited that pleomorphists Naegli and Zopf were unable to perceive the existence of bacterial morphological classes, and that Cohn and Koch, within their own suppositions, ignore species of morphologically variant bacteria that are unable to grow within axenic cultures. Winogradsky explained the perception of pleomorphic bacteria as bacteria progressing through different stages within a developmental cycle, thereby providing the fundamental structure for a theory of morphology based upon the concept of dynamic deviation from a morphological type, or biotype. Coxiella burnetii bacteria displaying pleomorphism While the pleomorphic debate still exists in its original form to some extent, it has predominantly been altered to a discussion regarding the methods, evolutionary inception, and practical applications of pleomorphism. Many modern scientists regard pleomorphism as either a bacterium's response to pressure exerted by environmental factors, such as bacteria that shed antigenic markers in the presence of antibiotics, or as an occurrence in which bacteria evolve successively more complicated forms. A hypothesis referred to as \\"Pleomorphic Provolution\\", a component of Stuart Grace's \\"Ambimorphic Paradigm\\", takes both of these theories into consideration. Although it has recently been shown that certain bacteria are capable of dramatically changing shape, pleomorphy remains a controversial concept. A well accepted example of pleomorphism is Helicobacter pylori, which exists as both a helix-shaped form (classified as a curved rod) and a coccoid form. Legionella pneumophila, the species of intracellular bacteria parasite responsible for Legionnaire's disease, has been seen to differentiate within a developmentally diverse network. The genera Corynebacterium and Coccobacillus have been designated as a pleomorphic genera, diphtheroid Bacilli have been classified as pleomorphic nosocomial bacteria. Additionally, in one study focused on agents involved in a non- infectious disease, pleomorphic bacteria were found to exist in the blood of healthy human subjects. One factor that affects the pleomorphism of some bacteria is their nutrition. For example, the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans has been shown to exhibit pleomorphism in relation to differences in the nutrient contents of its environment. Viruses The virions of certain viruses sometimes exhibit pleomorphism, in the sense that their appearances can vary. However, this is not true pleomorphism, as individual virions are not changing shape, but being succeeded by virions with different shapes. One example is the bacterial viruses of the Plasmaviridae family. A group of haloarchaeal viruses has been shown to exhibit pleomorphism as well.

A Swiss citizen of Hungarian origin, he was a sociologist, a historian, a Doctor of Political Science, a former journalist and the author of a number of books on politics. Biography Nagy was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1921, discovered Scouting and went on to become an assistant Scoutmaster. He attended the 4th World Scout Jamboree held in G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, Hungary in 1933. Nagy received a Masters in sociology and law, and a PhD in political science. He was a graduate of the business administration School at the University of Geneva. He studied for many years under the direction of child psychologist Jean Piaget. Later, he became the Director of Study and Head of the Department of Research and Documentation at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. Nagy was also a journalist and author. He was Foreign Editor of the Gazette de Lausanne. Internationally he was recognised as an authority on the problems of Eastern Europe and of Sub-Saharan Africa. The books he authored included Imre Nagy, Katanga, Lenin and History of People's Democracies. 140px In 1965, he undertook a two-year critical study of the world Scouting movement around the world, sponsored by the Ford Foundation and appointed by the Graduate Institute of International Studies. Nagy published the Report on World Scouting in June 1967. In the course of the study, much data was compiled for the first time about worldwide Scouting, with many international trips made and countless interviews held. In the report, Nagy analysed and defined both the problems and strengths of World Scouting.Eduard Vallory (2012), World Scouting: Educating for Global Citizenship, Palgrave MacMillan, , p. 33. The 1967 World Scout Conference accepted the Nagy Report with its many recommendations for the improvement of World Scouting and its reorganisation. In 1968, WOSM invited him to put his recommendations into practice and appointed him to his WOSM post, for a three- year term that eventually lasted 20 years. Nagy was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting, in 1977.

He won the Brownlow Medal in 2008, with 24 votes becoming the tenth Western Bulldogs player to win the award. Early life Cooney attended Flagstaff Hill R-7 Schools, Blackwood High School and later Aberfoyle Park High School and played for the Flagstaff Hill Football Club. AFL career Cooney was recruited from West Adelaide in the SANFL to the with the number-one pick in the 2003 National Draft as a priority pick. Cooney was noted as a pacey player who could kick goals on the run from outside the 50-metre arc as well as snap kicks near the goal posts. Cooney debuted in Round 1 2004 against the West Coast Eagles, where he recorded 8 disposals and kicked a goal, and his first season saw him play 19 games and kick 11 goals for the season. He had a vastly improved 2005 season: he played every game, averaged 20 possessions a game and kicked 21 goals. He was ranked second for clearances in the Bulldogs team. Cooney progressed to the elite of the competition, four seasons after being selected as the number one draft pick. His threat as a goalkicking midfielder grew, in 2006 and 2007 he kicked 30 & 28 goals respectively, he then pushed into the upper bracket of ball winners, by collecting 458 and 469 total disposals over the 2006 & 2007 season, while maintaining his average of more than a goal per game and also directly assisting in many scores. Cooney was rewarded for a strong 2008 season by winning the Brownlow Medal. He polled 24 votes, beating Brisbane Lions midfielder Simon Black by one vote. Cooney is the first No. 1 draft pick (and the first player taken as a priority draft pick) to win the award. His 2008 season saw him amass 637 total disposals and boot 23 goals, highlighted by a 25 disposal, 5 goal outing against the Sydney Swans in Round 7. He played 25 total games in 2008 and averaged 25.5 disposals per game. In 2009, Adam had another great season, playing 23 games, kicking 14 goals and averaging 26.8 disposals, although he only managed to poll 3 Brownlow Medal Votes. He also featured in the official advertisement for the AFL, brushing off tacklers including a bull in a bullfighting ring. From the 2010-2012 season Cooney struggled with injury and form, his impact on game, particularly his goal kicking was very minimal, as he only provided 27 majors over 3 seasons, and playing a total of 47 games in that span. Cooney then bounced back in 2013, playing 19 games, kicking 19 goals and tallying 485 disposals for the season. The 2014 season was Cooney's final year at the Bulldogs, he kicked 13 goals and played 18 games. His last game for the Dog's saw him tally 20 disposals and 2 tackles, a game in which the Dog's lost to the GWS Giants. In October 2014, Cooney was traded to . The 2015 season was Cooney's first in the red and black, he only managed 11 games and kicked 10 goals, including 3 on debut against the Sydney Swans in Round 1. The Essendon Supplements Saga ordeal allowed Adam more of an opportunity to play regular senior football during the 2016 season. He managed to play 20 games and kick 6 goals, he also tallied 457 disposals. In August 2016, Cooney announced he would retire after the round 22 match against at Etihad Stadium. His final AFL game was also his 250th game and was fittingly against his old side, the Bulldogs, he gathered 22 disposals and kicked a goal. Personal life On 24 October 2009, Cooney married Haylea McCann. He proposed to her with a burger ring.

The remaining cards are then removed from play. =Trick-play= A round of ' consists of either 4 or 6 tricks. The dealer has the lead on the initial trick; the winner of each trick leads the subsequent trick. Play is standard no-trump trick-taking. Players are not required to follow suit; nor are they required to attempt to win a trick if they are able. There are no penalty cards in the game. At any time, a player may slough (play a card face-down); when this is done the player is ineligible to win the trick. After four tricks have been played, one of two situations will have occurred: *One player will have won all 4 tricks: If this occurs, that player is the winner of the round. He/she collects the pot, and becomes the dealer for the next round. If 4 or more players play (depending on house or regional rules), the player is additionally entitled to his winnings‚Äîthe other players must immediately pay the winner an additional amount equal to the initial bet. *Two or more players will have won at least one trick: (There is no advantage to winning more than one trick in the first four rounds). All players who have failed to win any tricks are eliminated from further play at this point; those players who have won at least one trick may continue. At this point, the 5th trick is played. The winner of the 4th trick leads one of his two remaining cards. The other remaining players play a card face down; after all cards are played, they are overturned. The winner of the 5th trick leads the last trick; all remaining cards are then shown. The winner of the 6th trick wins the round, and the pot. =Sped-up play= Players may, at any time, fold their hand by throwing all cards face-down onto the table. That player is then eliminated from the remainder of the round. He is not excused, however, from paying double should the rules require it. There is no tactical advantage to folding. Players with exceptionally strong hands may claim a win by displaying their remaining cards. If the hand is indeed unbeatable, they win the round, as if the hand had been played out normally. If their hand is not unbeatable, however, they are penalized. Again, there is no tactical advantage in claiming a win in this manner. =Scoring= There is no scoring as such in ', only the accumulation of winnings. At the end of each round, the winner collects the pot, and any bonuses due to him from the other players. Automatic winning hands In some games of ', the following hands are automatic wins‚Äîif a player is dealt one of these hands, he may display it immediately and the round ends. The player may win the pot, or double the pot, depending on the rules employed: * A hand containing four of a kind, of any rank, regardless of the two other cards. Note that a hand containing four aces is an automatic win, regardless of whether this optional rule is employed. * A hand containing a flush, consisting of six cards of the same suit. Note that a poker flush, five of the same suit is not sufficient. Penalty for holding an ace It is a common strategy for a player whose hand is rich in a particular suit, and who believes, to keep playing the suit until it exhausted, in an attempt to win the fourth trick while playing low cards. Winning the fourth trick is advantageous. Conversely, if one suspects an opponent is doing this, to hold onto a high card in that suit until the fourth trick is played, in an attempt to win the pivotal fourth trick, an optional penalty rule is often employed, which is triggered when: * A player who wins the first four tricks wins double the opponents' bets. * One player wins the first three tricks, by playing cards from the same suit. * Another player holds the ace of that suit, and does not play it‚Äîin order to wait for the last trick. * The player who wins the first three tricks then leads a suit in the fourth trick, winning that. If this occurs, and this rule is in force, the player who withheld the ace is required to pay the extra penalty for the other losing opponents. For example, if the initial bet is $1, and this occurs in a four-player game; the guilty player forfeits an additional $3--his share of the four-trick bonus, plus that of the 2 other losing opponents. Side pot One other common variation is the maintenance of a side pot. In addition to the normal bet, at the start of each round, a set figure is bet into a side pot. At the completion of the deal, one additional card from the deck is upturned. If any player has the card of the same suit, he is entitled to claim the side pot. He may do so at any time during the round, until the cards are collected and shuffled for the next round. If no player has the winning card, or a player who does forgets to claim the side pot, the pot accumulates until won. The side pot is completely separate from the main game play; a player need not win the main round, or even win a single trick, to claim the side pot. Variation: Eighty-three Like ', the main objective in eighty-three is to win the fifth trick, rather than the last Additionally, the game uses a scoring system with points rather than a winner-take-all format. Eighty-three is one of the easiest trick-taking card games to learn, but it is difficult to master. The name of the game comes from the fact that five is 83 percent of six. Dealing Three to eight people generally play this game. It can also be played by two players, but at the risk of decreased quality of the game. One player deals each hand, and each player receives six cards. Play The player to the left of the dealer leads with any card. Deviating from ', other players must follow suit and place their cards face up. As there is no trump suit, whoever has the highest-ranking card in the leading suit wins the trick. Trick winners lead subsequent tricks, and play continues until all competitors play each of their six cards. After points are assigned, the next round commences with the next player, in clockwise turns, leading the first trick. Scoring The player who wins the fifth trick is the winner of the round and scores two points. This player can earn an additional point if the fifth trick is won without an Ace (or a face card, depending on house rules) and another point if this player does not win the sixth trick. All players, whether they win the round or not, can earn a point if their hands contain four-of-a-kind of any rank or if all six cards are of the same suit. Because both conditions cannot be met simultaneously, a person can score a maximum of five points per round. Whoever reaches a predetermined final score based on the total points of each round wins the entire game. If two players pass that threshold and have an equal number of total points, tiebreakers depend on house rules. The player who won the most rounds might win the game and/ or more rounds are played until a clear winner is established. In the latter case, it is possible for other players to remain in contention and pull an upset by catching up and surpassing the tying players. This possibility, which also depends on house rules, essentially punishes the tying players for not definitively winning a game. Strategy In this game, players determine their own strategies based on numerous factors. As such, they may need to make alterations to their tactics often during a game. However, the most stable strategy, aside from keeping track of suits that have been played, is to win the fourth trick. The player who does so sets the suit for the fifth trick and has a good chance of winning with a high-ranking card. By extension, winning the third trick can help with the fourth; however, winning all of the first five tricks is an unreasonable goal, and so each player must decide on the best time to win tricks. A less stable strategy is to expel low cards during the first few tricks in order to save the high cards for the fifth trick. However, the limited number of cards and the requirement to follow suit makes this strategy difficult to follow sometimes. Additionally, the scoring provision regarding the sixth trick encourages players to keep at least one low card.

Part of the Province of Valladolid, it is the centre of a farming area. History Medina del Campo grew in importance thanks to its fairs held during the 15th and 16th centuries. This helped with banking and the businesses of wool, textiles, books and an enormous variety of other goods. As the population increased, the town expanded outward toward the plain of Zapardiel brook. Since then, the Padilla Street became the business centre of Medina. In 1489 a great trade agreement, that would last for 96 years, united the kingdoms of Spain and England with the reduction of trade tariffs, the recognition of France as a common enemy, and the marriage of Catherine of Aragon to King Henry VII's son, Prince Arthur (and later to King Henry VIII)‚Äîthis was known as the Treaty of Medina del Campo (1489). At the time of the Revolt of the Comuneros, Medina del Campo was a major town housing the royal artillery. A Royalist attempt to take possession of the artillery pieces led to heavy resistance culminating in the burning of the city. During the 16th century Medina del Campo thrived, with its fair becoming the most important among the triangle of great Castilian fairs (Medina del Campo, Villal√≥n and Medina de Rioseco). The fair of Medina del Campo featured a notable presence of international dealers, chiefly Castilian, Portuguese, Italian (Genovese, Milanese and Florentines) and Flemish, as well as also some French, English and German merchants. Medina del Campo in the mid-19th century, as drawn by Parcerisa. Between the 17th century and the 19th century decline set in. The city experienced a deep transformation in its social fabric during the early 17th century, through a process of ruralization that increased the proportion of the populace employed at the primary sector. The town took off again at the end of the 19th century, thanks to the arrival of the railway, the opening of the military district (the quarter of Marques de la Ensenada), and the opening of the hydrothermal establishment of Las Salinas. Also adding to the growth were the strong commercial sector, such as the furniture trade or the opening of shops on Sundays (which is not customary in Spain), and finally proximity of quality wines with the Denominaci√≥n de Origen of Rueda. Main sights Royal Palace Almost all the buildings of artistic interest date from the 16th century; examples are the country house known as Casa Blanca, the Palacio de Due√±as (Don Rodrigo de Due√±as Manor House) and the Hospital of Sim√≥n Ruiz. These buildings were promoted by rich merchant bankers who prospered thanks to the General Fair of the Spanish Kingdom held in Medina del Campo during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Museum of the Fairs was created to exhibit items connected to this open market, and it is a popular visitor attraction. The word \\"Medina\\" which means \\"city\\" in Arabic (). Medina del Campo was founded on the hill called La Mota in the 11th century, in the same place where the Castle is, and remains of a wall still survive. At the moment, the Mota hill is a suburban area, however in the Middle Ages it was the town centre. In addition, this hill has archaeological remains such as a stronghold, a medieval village and a Celtic walled settlement dated from the 4th century BC (Iron Age). Castle of La Mota Front view of Castle of La Mota. The word Mota refers to an artificial hill built to defend the castle better (See motte-and-bailey castle). The Mota fortress had a military function and it also was a royal dungeon, among its most notorious prisoners being Cesare Borgia. The castle was built between the 12th century and 15th century. It has a moat with its own drawbridge (today fixed), an outer curtain wall (for artillery), an inner curtain wall (with arrow slits for archers and guards) surrounding a large courtyard, and a great square tower (which is the Keep). The castle was abandoned and collapsed, but was restored after the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). It was the first monumental building in Medina designated as a Heritage Site (Bien de inter√©s cultural).  Walls Medina was a walled village, and its stronghold was a very important building around the town to protect the people from attacks. The walls date from the 11th century, and they were enlarged three times, as the population was growing. At present, there are only remains. St. Michael's Church This church was built beside the wall gate of the old town, opposite the original city hall, which no longer exists. Probably, its entrance hall was the meeting point of the council. The oldest part of the church is of Mud√©jar-Gothic style; but was renovated several times. The greater chapel has large dimensions, with Gothic ribbed vault roof and an interesting altarpiece dated from the 16th century. In the choir, which is in the west facade, we can admire the magnificent baroque organ, dated from the 18th century, a recently restored masterpiece. Las Reales Carnicer√≠as This is an ancient market-hall, in Spanish called Mercado de Abastos, on the left bank of the Zapardiel brook, was built under the Catholic Monarchs in 1500 in Renaissance style. Later, in the reign of Philip II, it was used for the sale of meat to the population. It is the only historic building of this type in the world still used for its original purpose. La Calle Padilla (Padilla Street) This lane connects the Main Square with St. Michael's Bridge (also called Puente de las Cadenas). This street was named in honour of Juan de Padilla, a communard leader of the Castilians in the 16th century (see Castilian War of the Communities); but earlier was named \\"R√∫a Nueva\\" (New Road). Padilla Street was the downtown area where numerous banks and jewellery shops settled, and actually some of them still mains. Whereas the financiers settled in Padilla Street, the other merchants were distributed in the Main Square according to Ordenanzas de Feriantes (Lodging Ordinances). La Casa del Peso (The House of Pounds) This building stands in the Main Square and is built over five elegant arcades with long balcony. It was established in the 17th century in order to keep the \\"Peso Real\\" (Royal Weight) and to guarantee the official weights and measures. Royal Palace This mansion was the residence of the royal family in the time of Fairs. In this palace many historical incidents happened during the 14th and 15th Centuries. The most important episode was the will and death of Isabel la Cat√≥lica (Queen of Castile), 26 November 1504 (for this reason it is also called Palacio Testamentario, Testamentary Palace). The Palace was started in the 14th century and was enlarged both by Don Fernando de Antequera (Lord of Medina del Campo and, afterwards, King of Aragon), as well as by the Reyes Cat√≥licos. It was restored three times, in 1601, 1603 and 1673. It was at one time much larger than the present-day building. Facade of the Collegiate Church of San Antol√≠n in Medina del Campo Collegiate Church of San Antol√≠n This church, dedicated to St. Antoninus of Pamiers (San Antol√≠n), is in Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque styles. It was constructed between the 16th century and the 18th century. The nave and the aisles are of Late Gothic style, with numerous chapels, such as the Chapel of the Virgen del P√≥polo, with a balcony, which was used to celebrate the mass for all the market traders lodged in the Main Square. The Collegiate Church of Medina was restored in 2004. Economy Silos in Medina del Campo The main activities of the industrial sector are furniture (example Castill Confort), metal (for instance, MADE S.A., or Ferroaleaciones Espa√±olas SA) the food industry (like Productos Casado and others). As for the service sector, it has a special place in the history of Medina, due to the tradition of Fairs. Today, many services are offered in the town such as administrative (private and public ones), or trade activities that are gathered in the historical centre of the town. Most of the land is dry, so, the most important crops are cereals. However, viticulture is important too in the north of the municipality.  Events  The Holy Week has been officially declared a Tourist Attraction, because of the artistic value of his religious images and the documented antiquity of its processions. The Film Festival Week has been, for 19 years, an appointment for the producers of Short-Films of the whole world. There is also a Sports Week in spring, one rooted Half-Marathon and a tennis tournament. It is famous for the Greyhound Races National Championship, which consists of hare-coursing. The local patron feast San Antol√≠n (Saint Antoninus of Pamiers) is held on 2 September. The celebrations revolve around the religious ceremonies and, above all, around the bullfighting. The encierros (Running of the Bulls) are very typical of Medina (they let the fighting bulls loose throughout the fields and along the streets of the city, leading them up to the bullring). Also emblematic are the Dodges, in Spanish so-called cortes, in which people go towards the bull and, just when the beast attacks, try to avoid them. ‚ÜíAnnual temperature average: 11.6¬∞C ‚ÜíAnnual range of temperatures: 18.4¬∞C ‚ÜíAnnual precipitations: 392 mm/m¬≤ ‚ÜíDry months: June, July, August and September ‚ÜíMonths with average temperatures under 0¬∞C: none ‚ÜíClimate: Mediterranean Continentalized.

The park is unique due not only to the size, but also the strange features, and unusual history of the reserve. For example, the centrepiece of the park is a pedestal designed to hold a large statue of Queen Victoria. However, this statue only stood watch over the gardens for three years before mysteriously going missing more than a century ago. It was never replaced, and the bare plinth remains as a strange reminder. Former Railway in Edinburgh Gardens A spur of the former Inner Circle Railway once bisected the gardens. The Fitzroy spur diverged from the line along Park Street, followed Mark Street across Alfred Crescent and finished at the former Fitzroy Station, located behind Brunswick Street Oval. This passenger service was never viable, and was closed only a few years after being built. The area was then used as a freight yard until the 1980s. Some sections of the old track are still visible through the park. Level crossings were retained when the tracks were removed. The old line has been replaced with a shared path that joins the Linear Park Reserve and leads to the nearby Capital City Trail. Factories associated with the line have been demolished and the land either returned to the Edinburgh Gardens or sold. A timber pedestrian bridge remained in the south-west of the gardens until about 2003. it was sold and removed to make way for a low-rise development for the Office of housing. W.T. Peterson Community Oval The grandstand at the W. T. Peterson Community Oval, built 1888 An Australian rules football oval located at the south-western corner of the gardens, the W.T. Peterson Community Oval (named after a 21-year veteran of the Fitzroy City Council) (GC: ) is better known to generations of Fitzroy Football Club supporters as the Brunswick Street Oval. The ground has a capacity of approximately 15 000 spectators. It served as the club's home ground in the VFA competition, and later the VFL competition from 1883 until 1966. The last game played there was in August 1966 when Fitzroy played St Kilda. Fitzroy lost that match by 84 points. Currently the ground is used by the Fitzroy Football Club playing in the VAFA and the Fitzroy Junior Football Club in the YJFL, it is considered the spiritual home ground of Fitzroy. The playing ground is now framed by the remaining original features of the oval: the visiting members gate structure at the corner Freeman and Brunswick Streets, and late nineteenth century grandstand, gates and ticket box on the opposite side of the oval. The main grandstand is on the Victorian Heritage Register. The ground record crowd for Brunswick Street Oval was set on 6 May 1935 when 36,000 fans saw Fitzroy draw with Collingwood. Both sides scored 14 goals and 9 behinds and were deadlocked on 93 points.

The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The Academy is often referred to as Annapolis, while sports media refer to the Academy as \\"Navy\\" and the students as \\"Midshipmen\\"; this usage is officially endorsed. During the latter half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, the United States Naval Academy was the primary source of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers, with the Class of 1881 being the first to provide officers to the Marine Corps. Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army or United States Air Force. Most Midshipmen are admitted through the congressional appointment system. The curriculum emphasizes various fields of engineering. The list is drawn from graduates, non-graduate former Midshipmen, current Midshipmen, and faculty of the Naval Academy. Over 50 U.S. astronauts have graduated from the Naval Academy, more than from any other undergraduate institution. Over 990 noted scholars from a variety of academic fields are Academy graduates, including 45 Rhodes Scholars and 16 Marshall Scholars.

It may present with lower back pain, kidney failure, hypertension, deep vein thrombosis, and other obstructive symptoms. It is named after John Kelso Ormond, who rediscovered the condition in 1948. Causes Its association with various immune-related conditions and response to immunosuppression have led to speculation regarding an autoimmune cause of idiopathic RPF. One-third of the cases are secondary to malignancy, medication (methysergide, hydralazine, beta blockers), aortic aneurysm, or certain infections. Diagnosis The diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis cannot be made on the basis of the results of laboratory studies. CT is the best diagnostic modality: a confluent mass surrounding the aorta and common iliac arteries can be seen. On MRI, it has low T1 signal intensity and variable T2 signal. Malignant retroperitoneal fibrosis usually give uneven MRI signals, bulky, extend above the origins of renal arteries, or displace aorta anteriorly. Besides, malignant retroperitoneal fibrosis less frequently displaces ureter medially when compared to other retroperitoneal fibrosis. On fludeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan, it will show accumulation of FDG in the affected area. Although biopsy is not usually recommended, it is appropriate when malignancy or infection is suspected. Biopsy should also be done if the location of fibrosis is atypical or if there is an inadequate response to initial treatment. Treatment In the absence of severe urinary tract obstruction (which generally requires surgery with omental wrapping), treatment is generally with glucocorticoids initially, followed by DMARDs either as steroid-sparing agents or if refractory on steroids. The SERM tamoxifen has shown to improve the condition in various small trials, although the exact mechanism of its action remains unclear.

Painting by James E. Buttersworth The Maritime history of Europe represents the era of recorded human interaction with the sea in the northwestern region of Eurasia in areas that include shipping and shipbuilding, shipwrecks, naval battles, and military installations and lighthouses constructed to protect or aid navigation and the development of Europe. Europe is situated between several navigable seas and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way which greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. Great battles have been fought in the seas off of Europe that changed the course of history forever, including the Battle of Salamis in the Mediterranean, the Battle of Gravelines at the eastern end of the English Channel in the summer of 1588, in which the ‚ÄúInvincible‚Äù Spanish Armada was defeated, the Battle of Jutland in World War I, and World War II‚Äôs U-boat war. Defeat of the Spanish Armada, 1588-08-08 by Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg, painted 1796, depicts the battle of Gravelines. Ancient times Greek trireme Egyptian sources mention regular shipments of copper from the island of Cyprus, that arrived at the city of Byblos as early as 2,600 years BCE. The Minoans of Crete are the earliest known European seafarers of the Mediterranean Sea. Little is known of their ships, but they reportedly traded pottery as far west as Sicily. According to the historian Thucydides, by 1,900 years BCE. their King Minos commanded a navy and conquered the islands of the Aegean. The Mycenaeans would obtain maritime hegemony in the region around 1,600 BCE and hold it until the attacks of the Sea Peoples, that disrupted the maritime culture and the naval balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age collapse between 1,200 and 900 years BCE. During the following centuries the ancient Greek navies first began to use ships with two banks of oars and by the 6th century BCE. the three banked trireme had been adopted by all sea-faring Poleis. Alongside the Phoenicians, who since around 1,200 BCE. had settled in the Levant and Northern Africa, Greek trading fleets and navies dominated the Mediterranean until the ascent of Rome in the third and second century BCE. Greek ships, methods of engagement, movement and command under the Athenian Strategos Themistocles proved to be highly effective during the Greco-Persian Wars (499 to 449 BCE). Relatively small Greek forces successfully delayed the Persian fleet in a series of naval engagements in 480 BCE. Naval conflict culminated in the straits between the port of Piraeus and Salamis Island during the Battle of Salamis (September 480 BCE), when 371 Greek triremes and pentekonters defeated King Xerxes' Persian fleet of over 1,200 ships, that included Phoenician, Egyptian, Cilician and Cypriot contingents. The city of Athens, that had risen to naval supremacy among the Greek poleis was defeated in the Peloponnesian War and lost its fleet against the Peloponnesian League under Lysander in the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BCE. Around 325 B.C. Pytheas, a Greek geographer and explorer undertook a voyage of exploration to northwestern Europe (modern-day Great Britain and Ireland) and beyond. In his account On The Ocean (Œ§·Ω∞ œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·Ω®Œ∫ŒµŒ±ŒΩŒø·ø¶), that is only known through the writings of Strabo and Pliny the Elder, he introduces the idea of the land of Thule and describes Celtic and Germanic tribes, the Arctic, polar ice and the midnight sun. Maritime history of Republican and Imperial Rome The administrative divisions of the Roman Empire in 395, under Theodosius I. Depiction of Greek fire in the Madrid Skylitzes manuscript. During the First Punic War, the admiralty of the Roman Republic cunceived new and progressive ways of fleet construction, development and composition in order to successfully engage the Carthaginian navy. Victories at the Battle of Mylae, the Battle of Cape Ecnomus, the Battle of Cape Hermaeum and the Battle of the Aegates encouraged the Romans to pursue naval-based warfare and strategies in order to push the center of combat to the Carthaginian heartland in North Africa. By the end of the Macedonian Wars in the latter half of the 2nd century BC, Roman control over the Aegean sea was undisputed and full hegemony over the entire Mediterranean Sea, now referred to as Mare Nostrum (\\"our sea\\") had been established. Roman galleys helped to build the Roman Empire. The empires‚Äô struggle with Carthage inspired them to build and to fight in war galleys, but the galleys did not have much cargo space, so ‚Äúround ships‚Äù were constructed for trade, especially with Egypt. Many of these ships reached in length and were capable of carrying over a thousand tons of cargo. These ships used sail power alone to haul commodities in the mediterranean. The volume of trade that the Roman merchant fleet carried was larger than any other until the industrial revolution. We know quite a bit about these round ships, since Romans, like Egyptians and Greeks, left records in stone, sometimes even on a sarcophagus. There were many shipwrecks of Roman vessels, which can be explained by the very large number of trading vessels during Roman times since the volume of sea trade in the mediterranean reached a quantity to be only equaled in the 19th century. This greatly increased the number of shipwrecks. Byzantine Empire The western Mediterranean came under the control of the barbarians, after their invasion split the Empire in two, while Byzantium dominated the eastern half of the sea. The eastern empire lasted until 1453, such was the efficiency of the Byzantine navy, with its fleets armed with Byzantine fire (or Greek fire), a mixture of naphtha oil and saltpetre, fired through tubes in the bows of the ship. Enemy ships were often afraid to get too close to the Byzantine fleet, since the liquid fire gave the Byzantines a considerable advantage. The Viking Age Voyages of the Norsemen Also called the Vikings, the Norsemen raided towns and villages along the coasts of the British Isles, Scandinavia, as far south as C√°diz, Spain and even attacked Pisa, Italy in 860. They sailed up the Seine River in France, settled Normandy (which derives its name from the Norsemen), and settled Dublin after invading Ireland. Varangians were more concerned with trading than raiding, and sailed along Russian rivers and opened commercial routes to the Caspian Sea as well as the Black Sea. The Vikings were the best naval architects of their day, and the Viking longship was both large and versatile. A longship found at Oseberg, Norway, was , more than wide, and had a draft of only . The shallow draft enabled them to navigate far inland in shallow rivers. Later on during the Viking period some of the ships were reported to be over long. \\"From the fury of the Norsemen, good Lord, deliver us,\\" has entered apocryphal knowledge as a common prayer among the people of western Europe during the period of the Norse raiders from the late 8th century to the 11th century. According to the website Viking Answer Lady, which in turn cites Magnus Magnusson's Vikings! as its reference, > No 9th century text has ever been discovered containing these words, > although numerous medieval litanies and prayers contain general formulas for > deliverance against unnamed enemies. The closest documentable phrase is a > single sentence, taken from an antiphony for churches dedicated to St. Vaast > or St. Medard: Summa pia gratia nostra conservando corpora et custodita, de > gente fera Normannica nos libera, quae nostra vastat, Deus, regna, ‚ÄùOh > highest, pious grace, free us, oh God, by preserving our bodies and those in > our keeping from the cruel Norse people who ravage our realms.‚Äù. The Hanseatic League Hanseatic League's formation in Hamburg, Germany (circa 1241) The Hanseatic League was a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant guilds of towns and cities in northern and central Europe that established and maintained a trade monopoly over the Baltic Sea and most of Northern Europe between the 13th and 17th centuries. Although trading alliances in the region were forming as early as 1157, the town of L√ºbeck did not form an alliance with Hamburg (which controlled access to salt routes from L√ºneburg), until 1241. Trade was carried on chiefly by sea in order to escape tolls and political barriers, and at the end of the 15th century the Hanseatic League controlled some 60,000 tons of shipping. Although compasses were commonly being used in the Mediterranean during this period, the captains of Hanseatic vessels seemed slow to adopt the new technology, which put them in greater danger of wrecking. They also had to deal with pirates. During its zenith the alliance maintained trading posts and kontors in virtually all cities between London and Edinburgh in the west to Novgorod in the east and Bergen in Norway. The League‚Äôs power declined after 1450 due to a number of factors, such as the 15th-century crisis, the territorial lords' shifting policies towards greater commercial control, the silver crisis and when the great herring shoals disappeared in the Baltic. During the late 16th century and early 17th century, the League fell apart, as it was unable to deal with its own internal struggles, the rise of Swedish, Dutch and English merchants, and the social and political changes that accompanied the Reformation. Although a tight-fisted monopoly, the League‚Äôs need for more cargo space led to new designs in shipbuilding, and its free association of about 160 towns and villages was a historically unique economic alliance that showed the benefits of well-regulated commerce.Istvan Szepesi, \\"Reflecting the Nation: The Historiography of Hanseatic Institutions.\\" Waterloo Historical Review 7 (2015). online Republic of Venice mariner's compass. Around 1300, Venice began to develop the great galley of commerce, the ‚Äò‚Äôgalea grossa‚Äô‚Äô. It grew to carry a crew of more than 200 and weighed as much as 250 tons. These galleys took passengers and goods to Constantinople (now Istanbul), and to Alexandria in Egypt, and returned to Venice carrying luxury items. A sea route to the Indies discovered by Portugal signaled an end to the glory days of Venice's merchant galleys and spice trade, but the war galleys (or fighting galleys) lived on. The war galleys were mostly manned by prisoners of war or convicts, who were chained to benches, usually three to six per oar. More than 3,000 Venetian merchant ships were in operation by the year 1450. The trading empire of the Republic of Venice lasted longer than any other in history, and even merchants vessels were required to carry weapons and passengers were expected to be armed and ready to fight. From the beginning of the 13th century until the end of the 18th century, the Republic ruled the Adriatic, the Aegean and the Black Seas. The Republic of Genoa was Venice‚Äôs main rival, and many wars were fought between them. In 1298 the Genoese destroyed the Venetian fleet at Curzola, but were themselves defeated in 1354 at Sapienza in Greece. The European Age of Discovery (1400‚Äì1600) The Age of Discovery started with the Portuguese navigators, where Prince Henry the Navigator started a maritime school in Portugal, eventually leading to new shipbuilding technologies including the caravel, the carrack and the galleon. The Portuguese Empire led the Portuguese Kingdom to discover and map more of the globe, such as the remarkable voyage to find the sea route to India via the Cape of Good Hope. Initially Bartolomeu Dias left Portugal and rounded the Cape of Good Hope, with Vasco da Gama reaching the southern tip of Africa and on-wards to India. It was the first time in history that humans had navigated from Europe around Africa to Asia, though the Fra Mauro map suggests that ships from India had crossed the Cape of Good Hope in 1420. It led to the discovery of Brazil and South America, and the first circumnavigation around the world, with the Portuguese nobleman Ferdinand Magellan, sailing around the world, across the entire Pacific Ocean for the first time. At the beginning of the 16th century, sea clashes in the Indian Ocean as the decisive Battle of Diu, in 1509, marked a turning point in history: the shift from the Mediterranean and from the relatively isolated seas, disputed in antiquity and in the Middle Ages, to the oceans and to the European hegemony on a global scale. A Spanish galleon Christopher Columbus set sail in Santa Maria on what is probably history's most well known voyage of discovery on August 3, 1492. Leaving from the town of Palos, in southern Spain, Columbus headed west. After a brief stop in the Canary Islands for provisions and repairs, he set out for Asia. He reached San Salvador first, it is believed, (easternmost of the Bahamas) in October, and then sailed past Cuba and Hispaniola, still searching for Asia. He returned home in 1493 to a hero's welcome, and within six months had 1,500 men and 17 vessels at his command. The year 1571 saw the last great battle between galleys, when more than 400 Turkish and Christian vessels engaged each other on the Gulf of Patras. The Battle of Lepanto as it was called, saw some 38,000 men perish. Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote, was wounded during the battle. In April 1587, Sir Francis Drake burned 37 Spanish ships in the harbor at C√°diz, in southern Spain. The publication of Jan Huygen van Linschoten's book Voyages provided a significant turning point in Europe's maritime history. Before the publication of this book, knowledge of the sea route to the Far East had been well guarded by the Portuguese for over a century. Voyages was published in several languages, including English and German (published in 1598), Latin (1599), and French (1610). Widely read by Europeans, the original Dutch edition and the French translation had second editions published. Once knowledge of the sea route became available to all Europeans, more ships headed to East Asia. A Dutch fleet embarked on a voyage to India using Linschoten's charts in 1595. (The Dutch version of his book was published in 1596, but his sea charts had been published the previous year). The publication of the nautical maps enabled the Dutch and British East India companies to break the trade monopoly Portugal held with the East Indies. Protestant Europe was ushered into the age of discovery in large part thanks to his work. European innovations Astrolabe, used for navigation until around 1730, when they were replaced with sextants From the sixth to the eighteenth centuries, the maritime history of Europe had a profound impact on the rest of the world. The broadside-cannoned full-rigged sixteenth-century sailing ship provided the continent with a weapon to dominate the world. During this time period, Europeans made remarkable inroads in maritime innovations. These innovations enabled them to expand overseas and set up colonies, most notably during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.1588 map of Northern Europe by Nicolo Zeno They developed new sail arrangements for ships, skeleton-based shipbuilding, the Western ‚Äúgalea‚Äù (at the end of the 11th century), sophisticated navigational instruments, and detailed charts. After Isaac Newton published the Principia, navigation was transformed. Starting in 1670, the entire world was measured using essentially modern latitude instruments and the best available clocks. In 1730 the sextant was invented and navigators rapidly replaced their astrolabes. Barbary pirates For several centuries, from about the time of the Crusades until the early 19th century, the Barbary pirates of northern Africa preyed on ships in the western Mediterranean Sea. In 1816, the Royal Navy, with assistance from the Dutch, destroyed the Barbary fleet in the port of Algiers. The best-known pirate of this period may have been Barbarossa, the nickname of Khair ad Din, an Ottoman-Turkish admiral and privateer who was born on the island of Lesbos, (present-day Greece), and lived from about 1475-1546. Siege of Gibraltar and the Battle of Trafalgar The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782. By John Singleton Copley (1738-1815) July 1779 saw the start of the Great Siege of Gibraltar, an attempt by France and Spain to wrest control of Gibraltar from the British. The garrison survived all attacks, including an assault on September 13, 1782 that included 48 ships and 450 cannon. In October 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar took place, which involved 60 vessels, 27 British, and 33 French and Spanish. The British did not lose a single ship, and destroyed the enemy fleet, but Admiral Lord Nelson died in the battle. It was the most significant naval battle of the beginning of the 19th century, and confirmed the British Navy‚Äôs supremacy of the time. Lighthouses Tower of Hercules The Pharos of Meloria is often considered the first lighthouse in Europe since Roman times. Meloria, a rocky islet off the Tuscan coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea, was the location of two medieval naval battles. The Tower of Hercules (Torre de H√©rcules), in northwestern Spain, is almost 1,900 years old. The ancient Roman lighthouse stands near A Coru√±a, Galicia, and is 57 metres (185 ft) in height. It is the oldest working Roman lighthouse in the world. According to Smithsonian, a lighthouse on the Gironde River in France, Cardovan Tower, was the first lighthouse to use a Fresnel lens in 1822. The light reportedly could be seen from more than at sea. Oil spills There have been several large oil spills off the coasts of Europe since 1967.

The name \\"sand monitor\\" can be used to describe various other species. Taxonomy John Edward Gray described the species in 1838 as Hydrosaurus gouldii, noting the source of the type specimen as \\"New Holland\\" and distinguishing the new varanid by \\"two yellow streaks on the sides of the neck\\" and small flat scales at the orbits. An earlier description, Tupinambis endrachtensis P√©ron, F. 1807, was determined as likely to refer to this animal, but the epithet gouldii was conserved and a new specimen designated as the type. This neotype was obtained in 1997 at the near coastal suburb of Karrakatta, between the state's capital and port cities, and placed with the British Museum of Natural History. The decision of a nomenclatural commission (ICZN) was to issue an opinion suppressing the earlier names, Tupinambis endrachtensis and Hydrosaurus ocellarius Blyth, 1868, that would be unsatisfactory to some who had commented on the case, but provided taxonomic certainty for future revisions of the associated taxa. The specific name is assumed to be a Latinised form of an associate of the describing author, the ornithologist John Gould, who was actively assembling specimens of fauna from Australia but is not thought to have any direct connection to this species. In some Aboriginal languages, the sand goanna is called bungarra, a term also commonly used by non-Aboriginal people in Western Australia. In Pitjantjatjara and other central Australian languages it is called \\"Tingka\\". Two subspecies are recognised, *Varanus gouldii gouldii ‚Äì Gould's goanna *Varanus gouldii flavirufus ‚Äì desert sand monitor Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Varanus.  Description  Eromanga, Queensland A species of Varanus, lizards known as monitors and goannas, that is found in a variety of habitat. Due to the taxonomic uncertainty during the twentieth century the species form and behaviour has included taxa later recognised as distinct species, this includes V. rosenbergi, formerly treated as a subspecies and later elevated, and V. panoptes, described as a new species in 1980 and resolved as a legitimate publication in 2000. Biology Gould's monitor is a terrestrial or \\"ground-dwelling\\" reptile that excavates large burrows for shelter. Rock escarpments and tree hollows are also suitable dwellings. V. gouldii inhabits a vast range throughout Australia, and reaches an average length of and can weigh as much as . They can be found in northern and eastern Australia, where they inhabit open woodlands and grasslands. V. g. flavirufus, a slightly smaller subspecies, resides in Australia's interior. In some places, however, the ranges of Gould's, V. g. flavirufus and the Argus monitor overlap. The similarities between the species and their close proximity frequently cause confusion.Northern TerritoryThe sand monitor is a relentless forager. It is diurnal, meaning most of its activities take place during the day. Anything smaller than itself will be eagerly devoured. The diets of hatchlings and juveniles often consist mostly of insects and small lizards, but generally varies more with age. Adult monitors will prey on mice, small birds, large insects, small lizard species, snakes, and carrion. They are seemingly immune to snake venom and will kill and eat even the most venomous species such as the Inland taipan. The sand goanna does consume smaller species of monitors: Ackies, rock monitors and other dwarf species are often found and eaten. It is common to see a Gould's disturbing rock piles in an attempt to flush out any Odatria. It lays its eggs in termite mounds to protect them from the harsh desert climate. Like all goannas and snakes the sand monitor has a forked tongue, with which it \\"tastes\\" the air. Scents are picked up on each side of the fork which, when retracted, brushes over an area in the mouth called the Jacobson's organ, which identifies on which side the scent is stronger. Upon identifying this difference in scent strength the sand monitor can alter its direction accordingly.

Life and career=1994‚Äì1998: Beginnings and Life Is Just a Game Van der Kolk was born on 16 September 1974 in IJmuiden, Netherlands. In 1991, she met DJ and producer DJ Sammy at Zorba's Club in El Arenal Mallorca. In 1992, DJ Sammy became resident DJ at the Joy Palace Club in El Arenal, while Van der Kolk was a resident dancer there, for whom she started to be a background singer for live performances. She soon adopted the stage name \\"Carisma\\" and performed as a featured artist on DJ Sammy's music. In 1996, they released their first singles \\"Life is Just a Game\\" and \\"You Are My Angel\\", which was their first hit. In 1997, with the release of their third single \\"Prince of Love\\", they scored a Top 30 hit in Germany, followed by the singles \\"Golden Child\\" and \\"Magic Moment\\". DJ Sammy's debut studio album Life Is Just A Game, which heavily involved van der Kolk on vocals, peaked at 62 in the German album chart. In the Summer of 1998. van der Kolk came up with a new project called Loona (leaned on the Spanish word \\"luna\\" for \\"moon\\"), also produced by DJ Sammy. Originally started as a Duo, DJ Sammy stayed in the background for music videos and cover arts. The first single, which also appeared as a bonus track on Life is Just a Game, was a cover of Paradisio's song \\"Bailando\\" and it became the summer song of 1998 in Germany, reaching the number 1 of the German charts and Echo-awarded as \\"Best International Dance Single\\". By Autumn, it was followed by another single \\"Hijo de la Luna\\" (a cover of the Spanish band Mecano) which also reached number 1 on the German charts. These two singles sold millions and became gold- and platinum selling records in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 1999‚Äì2000: Lunita and Entre dos Aguas In 1999, Loona's first studio album titled Lunita was released, followed by the third and final single from this album, the Top 30 hit \\"D√≥nde Vas\\". Afterwards, the song \\"Mamboleo\\", a cover version of Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer's song \\"Mambo\\", was released from the second album Entre dos Aguas. It was Echo- awarded as \\"Best Dance Single\\". Due to a lawsuit set up by Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer for infringement, a second black and white music video was shot, and finally both videos were banned from music stations and only played for just one day of airing. The song itself then had to be removed from Entre dos Aguas, the re-issued versions of the album do not include the track and only can be found on rare and early pressings. Still the song re-appeared and included on Loona's first compilation album Greatest Hits later in 2000. Entre dos Aguas saw three more single releases \\"Salvador Dal√≠\\", another cover of the Spanish band Mecano, \\"La Vida es una Flor\\" and the Christmas single \\"Navidad\\", becoming minor hits which did not reach the Top 50 in Germany. In 2000, Loona's first compilation album Greatest Hits and its first single, \\"Latino Lover\\" (a Spanish remake of \\"You're the Greatest Lover\\" by the pop band Luv'), was released and peaked at #6 in German and Swiss single chart. In 1999, van der Kolk again provided guest vocals as Carisma for DJ Sammy's single \\"In 2 Eternity\\" from his first remix album DJ Sammy at Work (In the Mix). 2001‚Äì2002: Baila mi Ritmo and Colors In 2001, Loona released the singles \\"Baila mi Ritmo\\" and \\"Viva el Amor\\" followed by her second compilation album Baila mi Ritmo. \\"Viva el Amor\\" became a number 1 hit in Spain. In 2002, she released the singles \\"Rhythm of the Night\\" and \\"Colors\\" from the third studio album Colors. For this album, Loona experimented with a more mature and oriental sound, which can be heard on songs like \\"Land of broken dreams\\", \\"If you want my love\\" or on the third single release and #4 hit \\"Rhythm of the Night\\", a remake of \\"Hadi Bakalim\\" from Sezen Aksu's 1991 album G√ºl√ºmse. In 2002, van der Kolk continued providing guest vocals for DJ Sammy's singles \\"Sunlight\\" and the Don Henley cover version \\"The Boys of Summer\\" from his second studio album Heaven, but this time for the first time credited as \\"DJ Sammy feat. Loona\\". 2003‚Äì2005: Wind of Time, hiatus and motherhood In 2004, Loona was featured on DJ Sammy's single \\"Rise Again\\" and released her first and only single, the Eric Clapton classic \\"Tears In Heaven\\", of her fourth studio album Wind of Time, followed in 2005. Both singles became moderate hits. The album is a collection full of cover versions. According to van der Kolk, she dedicated the album title, selected track list and the entire album to her mother, whom she lost ten years ago. It features covers such as Procol Harum's \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", Peter Sarstedt's \\"Where Do You Go to My Lovely\\", Ralph McTell's \\"Streets Of London\\", Sting's \\"Fragile\\" or Bob Dylan's \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\". She emotionally performed \\"Tears In Heaven\\" at \\"The Dome\\" crying and pregnant with her first child, her daughter named Saphira Maria, welcomed in 2005. In 2005, Loona released the David Bisbal classic \\"Oye el Boom\\" and went on hiatus for her baby. 2007‚Äì2008: Everybody on the Floor and Moonrise In 2007, Loona's third compilation album Everybody on the Floor and the same titled single, a reggaeton song titled \\"Everybody on the Floor (Uh la la la)\\" have been released. In May 2008, Loona signed a new contract with Sony BMG/Ariola and returned with her fifth studio album \\"Moonrise\\" in October, preceded by its two single releases \\"Por la Noche\\" and \\"Salam Aleikoum\\", all with limited success. Professionally and in private, van der Kolk parted ways with her longtime collaborator and father of her daughter, DJ Sammy. She was also a Judge in the seventh season of the German version of \\"Popstars\\" alongside rapper Sido and choreographer Detlef Soost. 2009‚Äì2013: Rakatakata (Un Rayo de Sol) and collaborations In 2009, Loona returned with the cover version of Cidinho & Doca, \\"Parapapapapa\\" to her summer tune roots since \\"Viva el Amor\\" in 2001. The single peaked #29 in the German single chart. van der Kolk attended the VOX television program \\"Das perfekte Promidinner im Schlafrock\\". In 2010, the single \\"Vamos a la playa\\", a Miranda cover, she landed another summer hit, charted at No. 2 in Belgium, and \\"El Cucaracho, El Muchacho\\", a collaboration with Movetown, followed. \\"Vamos a la playa\\" also reached No. 3 in France, No. 1 in Ha√Øti, No. 5 in South-Africa, No. 16 in Swiss, No. 22 in Denmark, and No. 29 in Germany. In July 2011, the single and Pigbag classic \\"El Tibur√≥n\\" charted at #31 in the German single chart. Again in 2012, van der Kolk attended the VOX television program \\"Das perfekte Promidinner im Schlafrock\\" and the ProSieben program \\"TV Total Wok WM\\". In June 2012, Loona posed nude for the German edition of Playboy. Until 2013, Loona released four further songs, the singles \\"Policia\\", \\"Oh la la, dance avec moi\\", the Los Diablos cover version \\"Rakatakata (Un Rayo de Sol)\\". All these singles to be included on her long-awaited, sixth studio album with the working title Summer Dance, later retitled Rakatakata (Un Rayo de Sol). Loona appeared as guest vocalist on DJ Cassey Doreen's single \\"Tell it to my Heart\\", a Taylor Dayne cover version. 2014‚Äì2015: Brazil and singles In 2014, the single \\"Brazil\\", a cover of Francisco Alves's \\"Aquarela do Brasil\\", was released for the FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Loona was also guest vocalist on Flava & Stevenson's 2k14 remix of their single \\"Rio de Janeiro\\", found on their album Quantum of Dance, which both latter mentioned songs appeared on her first extended play titled Brazil. In 2014, Loona released the single \\"Ademloos door de Nacht\\", a Dutch-language cover version of German singer Helene Fischer's single \\"Atemlos durch die Nacht\\" and first release under her real name Marie-Jos√© van der Kolk, from her upcoming studio album. In the summer of 2015, Loona re-released her single \\"Caliente\\" in a remixed version, and the German language single \\"OMG! Dein Body ist so Hei√ü\\" alongside Ko&Ko;, formally Gebroeders Ko. 2016‚Äìpresent: Badam In 2016, Loona released her single \\"Badam\\", a cover version of Lylloo & Lorinda, as a lead single from her eponymous titled seventh studio album. Artistry Loona is best known for her catchy, good mood, summervibe tunes such as \\"Bailando\\", \\"Vamos a la Playa\\", \\"Mamboleo\\", \\"Latino Lover\\" or \\"Viva el Amor\\" with easy beats, sounds, melodies and simple lyrics. Although she also released ballads such as the Mecano cover versions \\"Hijo de la Luna\\" or \\"Salvador Dal√≠\\". Other genres include pop (\\"D√≥nde Vas\\" or \\"La Vida es una Flor\\"), vocal trance/electronic (\\"Prince of Love\\", \\"Sunlight\\" or \\"Rise Again\\"), R&B; (\\"No one loves you (like I do)\\") or reggaeton, such as \\"Everybody on the floor (Uh la la la)\\". While Loona experimented with ambient sounds on the second album Entre dos aguas, such as in \\"Pajaro sin cielo\\" or \\"Tell me why\\", for the third studio album Colors, she used a more mature and oriental sound, which can be heard on songs like \\"Land of broken dreams\\", \\"If you want my love\\" or \\"Rhythm of the Night\\", a remake of \\"Hadi Bakalƒ±m\\" from Sezen Aksu's 1991 album G√ºl√ºmse. Since \\"Parapapapapa\\", Loona has returned to the summervibe tune roots.

All three titles were flick-screen adventures, in which the player controls the title character through a number of rooms, dispatching enemies and rescuing innocent people. The manner of this varies between the three games. Joe Blade Joe comes across a kidnapped World Leader and a guard (ZX Spectrum) The first Joe Blade title portrayed Blade as a lone commando sent into an evil mastermind's complex to release a number of diplomats. It was one of the earliest video games to be placed on the Index in Germany due to accusations that it \\"glorified\\" war and that the villains resembled SS troopers. While the game was still legally obtainable, it effectively banned the game from distribution, as technologies such as the Internet were not available at the time and German publications were not permitted to advertise the titles. Joe Blade 2 Joe encounters a trenchcoated citizen and a punk (ZX Spectrum) Joe Blade 2 took a rather different approach to the first game. Instead of being a soldier, Blade was this time a vigilante taking to the city to rid the streets of criminals, rescuing old-age pensioners along the way. Blade was no longer armed with a gun, and had to jump over villains, just touching them with his feet, to dispatch them. This almost surreal take on the game was in stark contrast to the comparatively more gritty realism of the first installment. The game was also known for being considerably easier than the first title, almost to the point where many players managed to complete the game in one hour-long sitting. The Spectrum version of the game featured a version of Invade-a-Load featuring Pac ManCargando‚Ä¶ Publicado por Diego Cuevas (in Spanish). Joe Blade 3 Joe Blade 3 returned to the first title's formula, arming Blade with a machine gun. Exclusively released for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC, it included Commodore 64 instructions in its inlay, but no Commodore 64 version was ever released. Legacy A 1991 Players game, Prison Riot plays very similarly to the Joe Blade titles and a hacked version that identifies itself as Joe Blade 4 has been distributed on the internet.

This additional data is often \\"folded\\" into the pointer, meaning stored inline in the data representing the address, taking advantage of certain properties of memory addressing. The name comes from \\"tagged architecture\\" systems, which reserved bits at the hardware level to indicate the significance of each word; the additional data is called a \\"tag\\" or \\"tags\\", though strictly speaking \\"tag\\" refers to data specifying a type, not other data; however, the usage \\"tagged pointer\\" is ubiquitous. Folding tags into the pointer There are various techniques for folding tags into a pointer.Friday Q&A; 2012-07-27: Let's Build Tagged Pointers, by Mike Ash Most architectures are byte-addressable (the smallest addressable unit is a byte), but certain types of data will often be aligned to the size of the data, often a word or multiple thereof. This discrepancy leaves a few of the least significant bits of the pointer unused, which can be used for tags ‚Äì most often as a bit field (each bit a separate tag) ‚Äì as long as code that uses the pointer masks out these bits before accessing memory. E.g., on a 32-bit architecture (for both addresses and word size), a word is 32 bits = 4 bytes, so word-aligned addresses are always a multiple of 4, hence end in 00, leaving the last 2 bits available; while on a 64-bit architecture, a word is 64 bits = 8 bytes, so word-aligned addresses end in 000, leaving the last 3 bits available. In cases where data is aligned at a multiple of word size, further bits are available. In case of word-addressable architectures, word-aligned data does not leave any bits available, as there is no discrepancy between alignment and addressing, but data aligned at a multiple of word size does. Conversely, in some operating systems, virtual addresses are narrower than the overall architecture width, which leaves the most significant bits available for tags; this can be combined with the previous technique in case of aligned addresses. This is particularly the case on 64-bit architectures, as 64 bits of address space are far above the data requirements of all but the largest applications, and thus many practical 64-bit processors have narrower addresses. Note that the virtual address width may be narrower than the physical address width, which in turn may be narrower than the architecture width; for tagging of pointers in user space, the virtual address space provided by the operating system (in turn provided by the memory management unit) is the relevant width. In fact, some processors specifically forbid use of such tagged pointers at the processor level, notably x86-64, which requires the use of canonical form addresses by the operating system, with most significant bits all 0s or all 1s. Lastly, the virtual memory system in most modern operating systems reserves a block of logical memory around address 0 as unusable. This means that, for example, a pointer to 0 is never a valid pointer and can be used as a special null pointer value. Unlike the previously mentioned techniques, this only allows a single special pointer value, not extra data for pointers generally. Examples A significant example of the use of tagged pointers is the Objective-C runtime on iOS 7 on ARM64, notably used on the iPhone 5S. In iOS 7, virtual addresses are 33 bits (byte-aligned), so word-aligned addresses only use 30 bits, leaving 3 bits for tags. Objective-C class pointers are word-aligned, and the tag fields are used for many purposes, such as storing a reference count and whether the object has a destructor.Friday Q&A; 2013-09-27: ARM64 and You, by Mike Ash[objc explain: Non-pointer isa] Early versions of MacOS used tagged addresses called Handles to store references to data objects. The high bits of the address indicated whether the data object was locked, purgeable, and/or originated from a resource file, respectively. This caused compatibility problems when MacOS addressing advanced from 24 bits to 32 bits in System 7. Null versus aligned pointer Use of zero to represent a null pointer is extremely common, with many programming languages (such as Ada) explicitly relying on this behavior. In theory, other values in an operating system-reserved block of logical memory could be used to tag conditions other than a null pointer, but these uses appear to be rare, perhaps because they are at best non-portable. It is generally accepted practice in software design that if a special pointer value distinct from null (such as a sentinel in certain data structures) is needed, the programmer should explicitly provide for it. Taking advantage of the alignment of pointers provides more flexibility than null pointers/sentinels because it allows pointers to be tagged with information about the type of data pointed to, conditions under which it may be accessed, or other similar information about the pointer's use. This information can be provided along with every valid pointer. In contrast, null pointers/sentinels provide only a finite number of tagged values distinct from valid pointers. In a tagged architecture, a number of bits in every word of memory are reserved to act as a tag. Tagged architectures, such as the Lisp machines, often have hardware support for interpreting and processing tagged pointers. GNU libc malloc() provides 8-byte aligned memory addresses for 32-bit platforms, and 16-byte alignment for 64-bit platforms. Larger alignment values can be obtained with posix_memalign(). Examples=Example 1 In the following C code, the value of zero is used to indicate a null pointer: void optionally_return_a_value (int* optional_return_value_pointer) { /* ... */ int value_to_return = 1; /* is it non-NULL? (note that NULL, logical false, and zero compare equally in C) */ if (optional_return_value_pointer) /* if so, use it to pass a value to the calling function */ *optional_return_value_pointer = value_to_return; /* otherwise, the pointer is never dereferenced */ } Example 2 Here, the programmer has provided a global variable, whose address is then used as a sentinel: #define SENTINEL &sentinel;_s node_t sentinel_s; void do_something_to_a_node (node_t * p) { if (NULL  p) /* do something */ else if (SENTINEL  p) /* do something else */ else /* treat p as a valid pointer to a node */ } Example 3 Assume we have a data structure \`table_entry\` that is always aligned to a 16 byte boundary. In other words, the least significant 4 bits of a table entry's address are always 0 (2^4 = 16). We could use these 4 bits to mark the table entry with extra information. For example, bit 0 might mean read only, bit 1 might mean dirty (the table entry needs to be updated), and so on. If pointers are 16-bit values, then: * \`0x3421\` is a read-only pointer to the \`table_entry\` at address \`0x3420\` * \`0xf472\` is a pointer to a dirty \`table_entry\` at address \`0xf470\` Advantages The major advantage of tagged pointers is that they take up less space than a pointer along with a separate tag field. This can be especially important when a pointer is a return value from a function. It can also be important in large tables of pointers. A more subtle advantage is that by storing a tag in the same place as the pointer, it is often possible to guarantee the atomicity of an operation that updates both the pointer and its tag without external synchronization mechanisms. This can be an extremely large performance gain, especially in operating systems. Disadvantages Tagged pointers have some of the same difficulties as xor linked lists, although to a lesser extent. For example, not all debuggers will be able to properly follow tagged pointers; however, this is not an issue for a debugger that is designed with tagged pointers in mind. The use of zero to represent a null pointer does not suffer from these disadvantages: it is pervasive, most programming languages treat zero as a special null value, and it has thoroughly proven its robustness. An exception is the way that zero participates in overload resolution in C++, where zero is treated as an integer rather than a pointer; for this reason the special value nullptr is preferred over the integer zero. However, with tagged pointers zeros are usually not used to represent null pointers.

In February 1995, Bally and Lady Luck entered into a joint venture agreement, under which Bally would close its casino and move the barge upriver to dock at Lady Luck's hotel. Bally would own 58 percent of the combined venture and manage it, with Lady Luck and a local partner owning the rest. Bally's at Mhoon Landing closed on February 9. The casino reopened at its new location in Robinsonville (now Tunica Resorts) on December 18, 1995. Hilton Hotels acquired Bally in 1996 and then purchased Lady Luck's share of Bally's Tunica in 1997 for $15 million. Hilton's gaming division, including Bally's, was spun off in 1998 as Park Place Entertainment, later renamed as Caesars Entertainment. In 2004, Harrah's Entertainment agreed to purchase Caesars. The deal provoked antitrust concerns in some markets, including Tunica, where the combined company would own 5 out of the 9 casinos in the area. To ensure approval of the merger, Harrah's and Caesars agreed to sell four casinos, including Bally's Tunica and Harrah's Mardi Gras, to Colony Capital. The sale was completed in April 2005. The casino continued using the Bally's name under a licensing agreement. The two properties became part of Resorts International Holdings, a newly formed affiliate of Colony Capital. In 2011, facing a threat of foreclosure, Resorts International Holdings agreed to hand over ownership of Bally's Tunica and Resorts Tunica (formerly Harrah's) to lenders. Foundation Gaming Group, a company based in Gulfport, was retained to manage the two properties. In January, 2014, RIH Acquisitions MS II assumed the management of Bally's Tunica and Resorts Tunica. In May 2017, Bally's and Resorts Tunica were sold in a joint deal, with Gaming & Leisure Properties acquiring their real estate assets for a total of $83 million, and Penn National purchasing the operating assets for a total of $44 million. The casino was renamed in September 2017 to 1st Jackpot Casino Tunica. The hotel was later demolished.https://wreg.com/2017/10/30/ballys-hotel-in-tunica- demolished/ See also *List of casinos in Mississippi ReferencesExternal links * Category:Casinos in Mississippi Category:1995 establishments in Mississippi Category:Casinos in Tunica County, Mississippi Category:Tourist attractions in Mississippi ","title":"1st Jackpot Casino Tunica"},{"id":"3755579","text":"Adrien Gabriel Victurnien de Roug√© (2 July 1782 in Everly - 16 June 1838 in Guyencourt), was a French statesman, distinguished soldier, and Peer of France member of the House of Roug√©.

He represented Virginia in the U.S. House from 1793 to 1801. In 1798, before the enactment of the Sedition Act, which made it a crime to publish \\"false, scandalous, and malicious writing\\" against the government or its officials, Nicholas declared the proposed Act to be unconstitutional. The Act was inconsistent with the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, Nicholas said, because the press could be punished for publishing true statements if it were not possible to prove the truth of the statements, which is often the case. In 1799, when Republicans in the House proposed to repeal the Sedition Act, a party line vote resulted in the rejection of the proposal. Nicholas wrote a minority report describing the policy goal of the Act as being related to Great Britain's form of government: \\"The King is hereditary, and according to the theory of their Government, can do no wrong. Public officers are his representatives, and derive some portion of his inviolability.\\" Nicholas distinguished this form of deferential respect for public officers to the level of respect owed to their American counterparts, who serve the people and can be removed from office during elections. In 1803 Nicholas moved to Geneva, New York and started a farm. From 1806 until 1809 he served in the New York State Senate. He died at home, and is buried in the Glenwood Cemetery in Geneva. State Senator Robert C. Nicholas (1801‚Äì1854) was his son.

The first issue was released in February 1933, a month before Doc Savage, which was released in March 1933. The title continued to be released until 1953, with a total 170 issues. This is the third highest number of issues for a character pulp, after The Shadow, which had 325 issues, and Doc Savage, which had 181. In western titles, Texas Rangers would have around 212 issues of their main character, known as the Lone Wolf. Publication history The Phantom Detective in America's Best Comics #26 (1948) The series was published by Ned Pines' Thrilling (also known as Better or Standard) Publishing. Ned Pines had a comic book imprint, which collectors usually refer to as Nedor Comics, and The Phantom Detective had a series in their title Thrilling Comics. Stories were credited to several pseudonyms. The first eleven Phantom Detective stories were published under the Better house pseudonym of \\"G. Wayman Jones\\", and were largely written by D. L. Champion, a.k.a. Jack D'arcy. The rest were published under the pseudonym \\"Robert Wallace\\". These were largely written by Edwin V. Burkholder, Norman A. Daniels (36+), Anatole F. Feldman, Charles Greenberg, George A. MacDonald, Laurence Donovan and C. S. Montanye. Less frequent contributors included Paul Chadwick, Norvell W. Page, Paul Ernst, Emile C. Tepperman, Henry Kuttner, Ray Cummings, Ralph Oppenheim and others. Ryerson Johnson is credited with #46, The Silent Death. There have been several reprints of Phantom Detective stories over the years. Soft porn publisher Corinth Books released the most, with 20 titles. Character overview The Phantom (as he was called in the stories) is actually the wealthy Richard Curtis Van Loan. In the first few issues of the title, the Phantom is introduced as a world-famous detective, whose true identity is only known by one man‚ÄîFrank Havens, the publisher of the Clarion newspaper. Richard Curtis Van Loan is orphaned at an early age, but inherits wealth. Before World War I, he leads the life of an idle playboy, but during the war he becomes a pilot and downs many German planes. After the war, Van Loan has a difficult time returning to his old life. At the suggestion of his father's friend, Havens, he sets out to solve a crime that had stumped the police. After solving it, he decides he has found his calling. He trains himself in all facets of detection and forensics, and becomes a master of disguise and escape. He makes a name for himself as the Phantom, whom all police agencies around the world know and respect. When dealing with law enforcement officials he carries a platinum badge in the shape of a domino mask as proof of his true identity. The initial stories were less about a detective than an adventurer using disguise and lucky escapes to conclude his cases. In one issue, Havens installs a red beacon on the roof of the Clarion building, which he turns on when he needs to see the Phantom. (This served as an inspiration for Batman's Bat-Signal; two early Batman editors, Jack Schiff and Mort Weisinger, got their start editing The Phantom Detective under editor-in-chief Leo Margulies.) Other people in Van Loan's life include Muriel Havens, Frank Havens' daughter, with whom he is in love, and Clarion reporter Steve Huston. Laurence Donovan introduced a kid sidekick named Chip Dorlan in the 1939 novel, The Sampan Murders. After Pearl Harbor, Chip joins the Army as an Intelligence officer, returning briefly to the series after the war. Van Loan's former mechanic and pilot, Jerry Lannigan, assists him in several cases, as do others from time to time. The Phantom employs several alternate identities, including Lester Cornwell and Dr. Paul Bendix, a chemist. The pseudonym \\"Robert Wallace\\" was coined to evoke popular British thriller novelist Edgar Wallace, and was used on short stories and novelettes not featuring the Phantom. Cultural references The early episodes of Lee Falk's The Phantom newspaper strip strongly resemble the Phantom Detective. Abruptly, Falk abandoned this tack for the exotic adventure approach, abandoning his Manhattan locale and the Phantom's original identity of playboy Jimmy Wells. Reprints & Continuations The property slid into the public domain when the copyright was not renewed, allowing others to bring the character back into print. From 2002, Adventure House has been reprinting the stories of The Phantom Detective. As of 2018, 133 of the 170 novels have been reprinted, 126 of them as replicas, including the cover and additional contents, of the original Phantom Detective pulp issues. In 2006 Wildside Press LLC printed the \\"first new Phantom Story in 50 years\\": The Phantom's Phantom, which takes place in 1953 after the original pulp series ends. It was written in the first person, which allows an in-depth study of the Phantom's personality that never occurred in the pulps. In 2016, Airship 27 Productions published a new anthology featuring five original Phantom Detective stories by Gary Lovisi, Gene Moyers, Whit Howland and Robert Ricci.

History =1840s In 1841, the current Newport area and the community of Port Leon, just south, endured a severe yellow fever epidemic.Baptist, Edward E., Creating an Old South, Edward E., UNC press, 2002, In 1843 Port Leon, located on the St. Marks River, was devastated by a hurricane that produced a 10 foot storm surge. The area still struggles against the same recurring hurricane surges that move up the St. Marks River entrance. After the hurricane of September 13, 1843, washed away all of the homes, buildings and railroad tracks in Port Leon promoters Nathaniel Hamlin, James Ormond, Peter H. Swain and several others met a week later and made plans to establish another town. They spent several days searching for a site safe from the sea, then selected a piece of land on the west side of the St. Marks River, about two miles below the old town of Magnolia, Florida. This location offered high ground, fewer swamps, and beautiful bubbling springs. It was owned by the Apalachicola Land Co.Apalachicola Area Historical Society The organization permitted citizens who had suffered from the storm to draw lots at a cost of $25 and up. The promoters named this new town Newport and platted it with four streets running east and west. The streets were New, Washington, Market and Adams. Those that extended north and south bore the names Bay, Pine, Elm and West. These street names were remarkably similar to those in St. Joseph, Florida territorial Florida's largest town, about 80 miles to the west down the coast. =A seat of government= Since most of Port Leon was destroyed by the storm, Newport became the seat of government in Wakulla County on Feb. 1, 1844. One of the priorities became removing the debris from the St. Marks River, a project discussed and attempted almost 20 years earlier. Dredging was undertaken, but it failed to really deepen or remove many of the rocks from the river. Daniel Ladd, Newport's leading cotton merchant, solved the situation by ordering a 100-foot steam tugboat named Spray, later the CSS Spray.Haze Gray, Naval History Ladd used this craft to tow vessels into and out of Newport. Although those involved in the cotton brokerage businesses built several warehouses at Newport, the town shared its shipping with St. Marks further down the river. By that time, the Tallahassee Railroad had rebuilt its tracks that had been destroyed in the storm of 1843, and 40 hard- working mules were back pulling cars. A stage coach transported passengers from the terminal near St. Marks to Newport. Exporting cotton, tobacco and animal hides and importing items such as flour, coffee, whiskey, gunpowder, quinine and other medicines by rail proved expensive, however. =A plank road= Newport competed as a port with nearby St. Marks that offered a rail connection to Tallahassee that, in the beginning, featured mule-pulled train cars. Inland cotton growers and shippers through the rail terminus at Tallahassee would carry their cargo to these river ports on the St. Marks River from which they would be carried to other ports and processing points along the gulf coast and eastern seaboard. Although several roads led to Newport, the idea of a \\"plank road\\" became popular in the mid-19th century as an alternative to high railway charges and road-building problems. This type of road was introduced by the Spanish centuries earlier when they created routes of travel by laying logs across low places. Ladd, Ormond, John Denham, William McNaught and several others in Newport backed a plan to build a plank road proposed by Green and Joseph Chaires, wealthy Leon County planters. The Florida Legislature incorporated the Georgia and Georgia-Florida Plank Road Company in 1851.Florida Natural Areas Inventory: Wakulla County The road was to run from Newport to Thomasville, Georgia, but it was completed to only the Tallahassee vicinity. Wagons used this road at a cost of about $1, and it brought competition to the Tallahassee Railroad. Eventually, the rail connection from St. Marks was upgraded to accommodate locomotive-pulled trains and the St. Marks port became dominant over Newport with their wood plank road to Tallahassee. Newport dwindled but remains intact with a handful of residents. 1850s In 1856, the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad obtained controlling interest in the Tallahassee-St. Marks Railroad. The new company improved the tracks and replaced the mules with a steam locomotive that cut travel time from nearly five hours to two hours.Excerpts from an article by Marlene Womack, Historian.

Its selectivity to the cerebral D2 receptors is characterized by its respective Ki-values, which are as follows: 1.8, 3.5, 2400 and 18000 nM for D2, D3, D4 and D1 receptors respectively. It can be radiolabelled with radioisotopes, e.g. 3H or 11C and used as a tracer for in vitro imaging (autoradiography) as well as in vivo imaging positron emission tomography (PET). Images obtained by cerebral PET scanning (e.g. PET/CT or PET/MRI) allow the non-invasive assessment of the binding capacity of the cerebral D2 dopamine receptor, which can be useful for the diagnosis of movement disorders. In particular, cerebral D2 receptor binding as measured by carbon-11-raclopride (11C-raclopride) has shown to reflect disease severity of Huntington's disease, a genetical disease characterized by selective degeneration of cerebral D2 receptors. Other studies have investigated the relationship of D2 receptor binding capacity and personality disorders. For example, one study found decreased binding in the detachment personality trait. Radiolabelled raclopride is also commonly used to determine the efficacy and neurotoxicity of dopaminergic drugs.

The outgroup members can be anyone who possesses characteristics that are different from one's own, such as people of different races, religions, cultures, etc. It is a framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership and is conceptualized as a measurable state of mind with tangible consequences. Terminology The term allophilia was coined by Harvard professor Todd L. Pittinsky in 2006, after he was unable to find an antonym for prejudice in any dictionary. The term derived from Greek words meaning \\"liking or love of the other\\". Statistical factors # affection, # comfort, # engagement, # enthusiasm, # kinship. The allophilia scale measures each of these factors. It has been adapted and validated to other languages such as Italian and Spanish, also to various settings, such as to measure positive attitude toward people with dementia, younger and older adults. Allophilia scale Prejudice and positive intergroup relations The typical remedy for prejudice is to bring conflicting groups into a state of tolerance. However, tolerance is not the logical antithesis of prejudice, but rather is the midpoint between negative feelings and positive feelings toward others. Allophilia enhancement should serve as complement to prejudice reduction. Allophilia predicts positive relationships with outgroup members. For instance, a study in Spain shows that students having higher allophilia had lower social distance toward people with obesity. Besides, positive experience with outgroup members may increase allophilia, as it is shown in a longitudinal study of a cook's tour in Vietnam. In that study, the participants, who were Americans, reported positive feelings toward Vietnamese mirroring Allophilia facets in nearly 10 years after the event. In one study, symhedonia (experiencing empathic joy) has been shown to be more closely associated with allophilia, while sympathy (experiencing empathic sorrow) has been shown to be more strongly associated with prejudice.

It is a remake of the 1925 film Seven Chances and stars Chris O'Donnell and Ren√©e Zellweger. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $36.9 million against its $21 million budget. Plot A confirmed bachelor, after spoiling his would-be and half-hearted proposal to his girlfriend of three years (whereupon she leaves the country on assignment for work), discovers that his eccentric grandfather has died and left him the family business under the conditions that he be married by 6:05 p.m. on his 30th birthday (which, unfortunately for the bachelor, is the very next day), that he not be apart from his bride for more than a week at a time over the next 10 years of their marriage, and that they must attempt to produce a child sometime during the first five years of their marriage, leading to the bachelor, his friends, his grandfather's friends, and a priest to scramble over the next few hours in search of a bride. If Jimmy fails, business competitor Oden Sports will buy the company. Shannon Billiards would not last a week. Meanwhile, Anne has second thoughts and returns to her apartment, which she shares with her sister Natalie (Marley Shelton). Natalie talks Anne into going home to go visit their parents in Napa for the night. A desperate Jimmie opens a shoebox full of photos of old girlfriends, and begins to track them down. First he sees Stacey (Rebecca Cross), an oil futures trader, who turns out to be engaged. Second is Zoe (Stacy Edwards), a clingy window dresser. Jimmie goes to see her, but just after promising he'd never leave her for another woman, he runs off after a woman in the street whom he incorrectly thinks is Anne. He returns to find Zoe has set a mannequin on fire in effigy of him. He strikes out with a melodramatic opera singer (Mariah Carey) and a tough-as-nails cop (Jennifer Esposito). Soon his list is depleted, but his last choice accepts‚Äî brittle, chain-smoking socialite Buckley (Brooke Shields), who detests Jimmie but wants his money to prop up her family's waning fortune. As the priest tries to conduct the ceremony, she gradually learns the other conditions of the will: she and Jimmie must have children within five years, spend no more than one night apart per month, and stay married for at least ten years. Horrified, she drives away. Anne misses Jimmie and heads back to the city. Trying to locate him, she calls Marco to arrange dinner with Jimmie. Desperate, Marco had earlier placed an ad for a bride in the newspaper. He figures a few women will show up at the appointed time and church for the offer. As everyone scrambles to help Jimmie save the family business, Jimmie realizes the \\"effect\\" of marriage, as the kindly priest reveals how he took on the priesthood after his beloved wife died, and that he was proud to be married and produce a wonderful family in the process. Realizing that he truly loves Anne and is ready to 'take the plunge', Jimmie, after being up all night, rests in the church where Marco had promised to deliver a bride. He awakens to find hundreds of women dressed as brides waiting for him. After trying to settle the women down, Marco lies and says it was all a prank. This angers them, and they try to rip the two men to shreds. Marco reveals that Anne is on her way back, so Jimmie flees to the train station, ordering a cake on the way. He makes it there after escaping the would-be brides. He finds Anne in the train, but she has discovered a newspaper with its front page asking, \\"Would you marry this man for $100 million?\\" with Jimmie's picture beside. She is upset, but he professes his love for her and they reconcile. Natalie finds a discarded wedding dress in the station, and Anne puts it on in the bathroom. She opens the door to see hundreds of would-be brides run past, chasing Jimmie. Jimmie flees. He eventually climbs up a flight on a fire escape ladder and shouts for Anne, as the would-be brides gather en masse below. The priest begins to conducts the ceremony over a loudspeaker from inside a police car, causing many 'brides' to attack the car, and chaos ensues. Anne, in the crowd, makes her way through and up to Jimmie. Natalie yells at everybody to \\"Shut up!\\". Anne convinces the other women to be happy and let it be her day. The priest finishes the ceremony by pronouncing them husband and wife, to cheers from all, and Jimmie and Anne kiss. They made it just in time before the deadline of 6:05 p.m. to inherit a 100 million dollars. She then tosses her bouquet into the teeming crowd below.

Great Masjid Erumeli Vavar (also known as Vavaraswami) is a figure that related to lord Ayyappa in Hindu belief. There is a shrine dedicated to Vavaraswami at Sabarimala, as well as Vavaraswami's mosque at Erumely next to an Ayyappa temple. The devotion of Vavaraswami to Ayyappan and the key role that the Islamic Masjid has in the Ayyappa Pilgrimage, highlights the communal harmony in Kerala. The devotion of Vavaraswami also highlights the relevance of Ayyappa devotion for members of all faiths, and the equality shown to all, whether they are Muslims, Hindus or Christians. Legend There are many legends about Vavar and his association with Ayyappa. Some believe that Vavar was a Muslim saint who migrated from Arabia to India with the intention of spreading Islam. Others suggest that he was a warrior who reached the shore of Kerala as a pirate in a ship to loot and plunder. During his encounter with Lord Ayyappa, he was defeated. Impressed by the youth's valour, Vavar became messenger of Lord Ayyappa and helped him in the wars in the mountainous region. As time passed, Vavar too became an ardent devotee of Ayyappa just like Kaduthaswami and came to be known as Vavar swami. The old sword on the wall of the Vavar shrine symbolises the eminence of Vavar as a great warrior. It is believed that the Lord Ayyappa himself instructed the King of Pandala Desam to build a mosque for Vavar at Erumely in Kottayam District. Sabarimala shrine is about 50 km away, deep in the Forest in Pathanamthitta district Erumely is the gateway to Sabarimala, the hillock shrine of Lord Ayyappa. This place is very famous for 'Pettathullal', a kind of mass spiritual dance perform by Ayyappa devotees. Pettathullal is performed in the Makaravilaku season, i.e., from mid December to mid January every year to commemorate the annihilation of a 'Mahishi' by Lord Ayyappa. It is believed that the aim of the incarnation of Lord Dharmasasta as son of Shiva and Vishnu was the annihilation of the Rakshasi Mahishi. Since Ayyappa is considered as a human incarnation of Dharmasasta, Erumenly is an important place of worship for Ayyappa devotees. After killing the Mahishi at Erumely, Dharmasastha performed a dance on her dead body. In order to commemorate this event, the devotees perform the ritual called pettathullal in Erumely.The Indian festival that brings Hindus and Muslims together, by William Dalrymple, the Guardian, March 27, 2010, The barefooted devotees perform this dance by wearing black dhotis, and garnishing their body with different colour powders and flowers and carrying toy bows, arrows and shrub branches and chanting the slogan \\"Ayyappa-thin-thakathom, Swami-thin- thakathom\\" The place name Erumely is believed to have been derived from the word 'Eruma kolli' fence formed with the help of buffaloes, which later was transformed to Erumely. En route the pilgrimage to Sabarimala during the makaravilakku season almost all of the Ayyappa devotees will come to Erumely and perform the ritual. Pettathullal starts from the small temple situated at the heart of Erumely town known as 'Kochambalam'. From there the dance procession advance to the Muslim mosque called 'Vavar palli' opposite to Kochambalam and the devotees worship 'Vavarswamy'. Finally the procession ends up at Dharmasastha temple known as 'Valliyambalam'. Shrine Vavarunada in Sabarimala There is a shrine dedicated to Vavar in Sabarimala next to the main temple. As per Islamic teachings there is no idol, but just a carved stone slab symbolises the deity of Vavar. A green coloured silk cloth is hung across one of the three walls. The fourth side is open. An old sword is also kept near the wall. The main offering to Vavar is black pepper. A Muslim priest still performs the rituals today as he was a Muslim.

Biography Lieutenant Colonel David DuBose Gaillard was born in Fulton Crossroads, South Carolina, which is located in what is now the Manchester State Forest near Sumter. Gaillard graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1884. After graduation from West Point and promotion to first lieutenant in 1887, he married Katherine Ross Davis. The couple had one child, David St. Pierre Gaillard. By 1903 he was a Captain in the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1908 Gaillard was placed in charge of construction of the central portion of the Panama Canal, crossing the continental divide. He was in charge of the notorious Culebra Cut through the backbone of the isthmus. Men who worked with him said he gave 12 hours every day to the Culebra Cut, besides which, he took his share in the labor of general administration of the Canal Zone. He checked up expenses, even on small things and once it was computed he had saved the Government $17,000,000. Gaillard succeeded in his mission, but did not live to see the job finished. He returned to the US suffering from what was thought to be nervous exhaustion brought on by overwork and died of a brain tumor on December 5, 1913 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, months before the canal's completion. He was 54 years old. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The Panama Canal opened nine months after his death. (Copy of a 1903 New York Times article) During the years of the US Canal Zone (c. 1915-2000), the Culebra Cut in the Panama Canal bore his name in his memory.  Family  Gaillard married Katherine Ross Davis at Winnsboro on October 6, 1887. She accompanied him to Panama and while there collected plant specimens for the United States National Herbarium. While in Panama she was also an orchid collector.

To the north is Gasparilla Sound, separating Gasparilla from Little Gasparilla Island and the mainland. History Gasparilla was sparsely inhabited until the late 19th century, with the only permanent residents being local fishing families.Stephens, p. 9. In 1848 the United States military established an outpost at Boca Grande. In 1897 Albert W. Gilchrist, future Governor of Florida, purchased land at Boca Grande and platted it for development as a town. According to Florida folklore, Gasparilla Island gets its name from the legendary pirate captain Jos√© Gaspar (\\"Gasparilla\\", c. 1756‚Äì1821), who had his base on the island and purportedly hid his fabulous treasure there. Much of the development of this legend is the result of promotion by a local hotel and railroad line. The folklore account does not appear in writing until about 1900, when it was included in an advertising brochure for the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway company.D'Ans, Andre-Marcel (1980). \\"The Legend of Gasparilla: Myth and History on Florida's West Coast\\" . Tampa Bay History. This brochure was given to the guests of the Boca Grande Hotel. It mentions that Gaspar's massive treasure, hidden somewhere on the island, had never been found. The version of the Gasparilla story told in the pamphlet influenced all later accounts, but is likely apocryphal. The name \\"Gasparilla\\" appears on maps dating to well before the time of the buccaneer; anthropologist Andre- Marcel d'Ans suggests it was actually named for a Spanish missionary named Gaspar or Gasparillo. In 1905 harbor dredging began and a Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railroad line was constructed, connecting Boca Grande to the outside world. Afterward Gasparilla was an important stop for phosphate shipping, and would remain so until the dredging of the Port of Tampa in the 1970s. In 1911 the first hotel, the Gasparilla Inn, opened, and the island became a major vacation destination for the elite from Tampa and Fort Myers. Though shipping has declined substantially since the last quarter of the 20th century, tourism remains important to the island's economy. The Wall Street Journal selected Gasparilla Island as one of the 10 Best Places for Second Homes.

Stoloff worked with Sammy Davis Jr., Dinah Shore and Frank Sinatra. Life and career Stoloff worked as music director at Columbia Pictures from 1936 to 1962. Among space age pop fans, he is best remembered for his 1956 Top 10 hit that paired the swing era tune \\"Moonglow\\" with the love theme from the movie Picnic, the medley called \\"Moonglow and Theme from Picnic\\". It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Stoloff was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A child prodigy on the violin, Stoloff was taken under the wing of W. A. Clark. After studying with Leopold Auer for several years, Stoloff was touring the U.S. as a featured soloist at the age of 16, and joined the Los Angeles Philharmonic a year later as its youngest member ever. When sound came to motion pictures, studios came looking for musicians to provide it, and Stoloff was one of the first to cross over from classical music to movies. He was the first concertmaster on Paramount Pictures' payroll, and he worked with setting up the mechanics of a system that had to provide a steady stream of music for everything from epic dramas to serials and comedy shorts. In 1936, Stoloff moved over to Columbia Pictures, where he took the title of music director, a new position unique to the studio system. As music director, he was the chief executive responsible for providing musical production support to every film the studio released. This meant matching up composers, orchestrators, conductors, musicians and recording facilities to meet the creative scope of each project as well as its schedule and budget. Stoloff often took partial credit for a picture's score when he worked closely with a particular composer to work out a theme, motifs, and melodies. As a result, he ranks among some of the most-nominated individuals in the history of the Academy Awards. He won three Oscars for best scores, including those for Cover Girl (1944), The Jolson Story (1946), and Song Without End (1960), and was nominated 14 other times. By the late 1940s, film music was beginning to be recognized on its own, and Stoloff began recording some of the more popular numbers as singles for Decca Records. When long-play albums were perfected, the studios saw the opportunity to market more than just singles to the listening audience, and soundtrack albums became a hot commodity. Stoloff exercised his privilege as musical director to record these soundtrack albums himself, working with material from the actual scores. When Frank Sinatra founded Reprise Records in the early 1960s, he hired Stoloff as musical director; the two having worked successfully before on Pal Joey (1957). One of Stoloff's most noteworthy achievements while at Reprise was the release of a set of re-recordings of great Broadway musicals, including Kiss Me, Kate with a studio cast. Stoloff died in Los Angeles, California, aged 81.

He is considered a member of the Ritter School. Spaemann's focus was on Christian ethics. He was known for his work in bioethics, ecology, and human rights. Although not yet widely translated into languages other than his native German, Spaemann was internationally known and his work is highly regarded by Pope Benedict XVI.http://web.tuomi-media.de/dno2/Dateien/NO510.pdf Life Robert Spaemann was born in Berlin in 1927 to Heinrich Spaemann and Ruth Kr√§mer. His parents were originally radical atheists, but both entered the Catholic Church in 1930, and after his mother's early death his father was ordained a Catholic priest in 1942.Catholic Information Portal (in German) Spaemann studied at the University of M√ºnster, where, in 1962, he was awarded his Habilitation. He was Professor of Philosophy at the Universities of Stuttgart (until 1968), Heidelberg (until 1972), and Munich, where he worked until he was made Emeritus Professor in 1992. He is also Honorary Professor at University of Salzburg and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Catholic University of Lublin in 2012. Work Spaemann's two most important works are Gl√ºck und Wohlwollen (Happiness and Benevolence, 1989) and Personen (Persons, 1996). In Happiness and Benevolence, Spaemann sets forth a thesis that happiness is derived from benevolent acting: that we are created by God as social beings to help one another find truth and meaning in an often confused and disordered world.

Negative refers to a photoresist whereby the parts exposed to UV become cross- linked, while the remainder of the film remains soluble and can be washed away during development. As shown in the structural diagram, SU-8 derives its name from the presence of 8 epoxy groups. This is a statistical average per moiety. It is these epoxies that cross-link to give the final structure. It can be made into a viscous polymer that can be spun or spread over a thickness ranging from below 1 micrometer up to above 300 micrometers, or Thick Film Dry Sheets (TFDS) for lamination up to above 1 millimetre thick. Up to 500 ¬µm the resist can be processed with standard contact lithography. Above 500 ¬µm absorption leads to increasing sidewall undercuts and poor curing at the substrate interface. It can be used to pattern high aspect ratio structures. An aspect ratio of (> 20) has been achieved with the solution formulation and (> 40) has been demonstrated from the dry resist. Its maximum absorption is for ultraviolet light with a wavelength of the i-line: 365 nm (it is not practical to expose SU-8 with g-line ultraviolet light). When exposed, SU-8's long molecular chains cross-link causing the polymerisation of the material. SU-8 series photoresists use gamma-butyrolactone or cyclopentanone as the primary solvent. SU-8 was originally developed as a photoresist for the microelectronics industry, to provide a high-resolution mask for fabrication of semiconductor devices. It is now mainly used in the fabrication of microfluidics (mainly via soft lithography, but also with other imprinting techniques such as nanoimprint lithography) and microelectromechanical systems parts. It is proven to be a biocompatible material and is often used in bio- MEMS for life science applications. Composition and processing SU-8 is composed of Bisphenol A Novolac epoxy that is dissolved in an organic solvent (gamma-butyrolactone GBL or cyclopentanone, depending on the formulation) and up to 10 wt% of mixed Triarylsulfonium/hexafluoroantimonate salt as the photoacid generator). SU-8 absorbs light in the UV region, allowing fabrication of relatively thick (hundreds of micrometers) structures with nearly vertical side walls. The fact that a single photon can trigger multiple polymerizations makes the SU-8 a chemically amplified resist which is polymerized by photoacid generation. The light irradiated on the resist interacts with the salt in the solution creating hexafluoroantimonic acid that then protonates the epoxides groups in the resin monomers. The monomer are thus activated but the polymerization will not proceed significantly until the temperature is raised as part of the post expose bake. It is at this stage that the epoxy groups in the resin cross-link to form the cured structure. When fully cured the high crosslinking degree gives to the resist its excellent mechanical properties. The processing of SU-8 is similar to other negative resists with particular attention on the control of the temperature in the baking steps. The baking times depend on the SU-8 layer thickness; the thicker the layer, the longer the baking time. The temperature is controlled during the baking in order to reduce stress formation in the thick layer (leading to cracks) as the solvent evaporates. The soft bake is the most important of the bake steps for stress formation. It is performed after spinning. Its function is to remove the solvent from the resist and make the layer solid. Typically at least 5% of the solvent remains in the layer after the soft bake, however the thicker the coating, the harder it becomes to remove the solvent, as evaporating solvent through thick layers becomes increasingly difficult with coating thickness. The bake is performed on a programmable hot plate to reduce the skinning effect of solvent depletion at the surface creating a dense layer which makes the remainder of the solvent more difficult to remove. In order to reduce stress, the bake procedure is generally a two step process made up of holding at 65 ¬∞C before ramping to 95 ¬∞C and holding again for a time dependent on the layer thickness. The temperature is then lowered slowly to room temperature. When dry films are used, the photoresist is laminated rather than spin-coated. As this formulation is essentially solventless (less than 1% solvent remaining), it does not require a soft bake step and does not suffer stress or skinning. For enhanced adhesion, a post lamination bake can be added. This step is carried out in a similar way to the solution based resist - i.e. holding at 65 ¬∞C then 95 ¬∞C, the time dependent on film thickness. After this stage the SU-8 layer can now be exposed, Typically this is through a photomask with an inverse pattern, as the resist is negative. The exposure time is a function of exposure dose and film thickness. After exposure the SU-8 needs to be baked again to complete the polymerization. This baking step is not as critical as the prebake but the rising of the temperature (again to 95 ¬∞C) needs to be slow and controlled. At this point the resist is ready to be developed. The main developer for SU-8 is 1-methoxy-2-propanol acetate. Development time is primarily a function of SU-8 thickness. After exposing and developing, its highly cross-linked structure gives it high stability to chemicals and radiation damage - hence the name \\"resist\\". Cured cross-linked SU-8 shows very low levels of outgassing in a vacuum. However it is very difficult to remove, and tends to outgas in an unexposed state. Newer formulations SU-8 2000 series resists use cyclopentanone for the primary solvent and can be used to create films between 0.5 and 100 ¬µm in thickness. This formulation may offer improved adhesion on some substrates versus the original formulation. SU-8 3000 series resists also use cyclopentanone for the primary solvent and are designed to be spun into thicker films ranging from 2 to 75 ¬µm in a single coat. SU-8 GLM2060 series of low-stress photoresist consist of epoxy GBL and silica formulation CTE 14. SU-8 GCM3060 Series of GERSTELTEC conductive SU8 with nanoparticles of silver. SU-8 GMC10xx Series of GERSTELTEC colored SU8 Red, Bleau, Green, black and others. SU-8 GMJB10XX Series of GERSTELTEC low viscosities epoxy for inkjet applications. SU8 GM10XX Series of Classic GERSTELTEC epoxy. Its polymerization process proceeds upon photoactivation of a photoacid generator (triarylsulfonium salts, for example) and subsequent post exposure baking. The polymerization process it a cationic chain growth, which takes place by ring opening polymerization of the epoxide groups. SUEX is a Thick Dry Film Sheet (TDFS) which is a solventless formulation applied by lamination. As this formulation is a dry sheet, there is high uniformity, no edge-bead formation and very little waste. These sheets come in a range of thicknesses from 100 ¬µm to over 1mm. DJMicrolaminates also sell a thinner range, ADEX TFDS, which are available in thicknesses from 5 ¬µm through to 75 ¬µm.

The first Black Bat He appeared in Black Bat Detective Mysteries (published by The Berryman Press), a short-lived pulp which saw six issues, all written by Murray Leinster (a pen-name of William Fitzgerald Jenkins), between 1933 and 1934. The character was called Black Bat in the way Simon Templar was called the Saint; unlike the Simon Templar books, however, none of the Black Bat stories ever mentioned the character's real name. The second Black Bat In July 1939, Thrilling Publications (also known as Standard or Better) introduced a new Black Bat in a series called Black Book Detective. Written mainly by Norman A. Daniels under the house name G. Wayman Jones, the stories describe the crime-fighting career of former District Attorney Anthony Quinn. In a clear departure from most pulp characters and heroes, this Black Bat actually has an origin story. It describes how Quinn became the Black Bat after being blinded and disfigured by acid when trying to save evidence against Oliver Snate in court, an idea borrowed a few years later by DC Comics for the creation of both the hero Doctor Mid-Nite and the Batman villain Two-Face (when D.A. Harvey Kent is disfigured by having acid thrown in his face in Detective Comics #66, August 1942; his surname was later changed to Dent). (Marvel Comics later created Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer who gained \\"super senses\\" and became Daredevil.) The Black Bat left paper stickers of a bat stuck to his victims, so like The Spider before him (who stamped a blood-red spider stencil on the criminals' foreheads), innocent people would not be blamed for their deaths, and other criminals would come to fear him. The Black Bat and Batman Both the Black Bat and Batman hit the newsstands around the same time, and both claimed that the other was a copy. The threat of lawsuits ended when DC editor Whitney Ellsworth intervened. Ellsworth had once worked for the Black Bat's publishers and brokered a deal that allowed both characters to co-exist peacefully. It is probable that the costumes of both characters were copied from the 1933/34 Black Bat series which featured costumed illustrations of the Black Bat inside the pulps, although in reality, the \\"Black Bat\\" in the stories wore ordinary street clothes. Batman creator Bob Kane always contended that the only bat-like man he had seen was the villain from the 1930 film, The Bat Whispers. However, the Black Bat did have a permanent influence on the Batman: chief Batman scribe Bill Finger called Kane's attention to the wrist flaps, which appeared to be gauntlets the rival character was wearing. Subsequently, similar \\"fins\\" were added to Batman's gloves which remain to this day.Comic Book Legends Revealed #179, Comic Book Resources, October 30, 2008 How the Black Bat got his abilities In the first issue, DA Tony Quinn is blinded by acid thrown by a thug working for Oliver Snate, a crime lord, and believes his career is over until a mysterious woman arrives (Carol Baldwin). She tells him that her father is a small town policeman who is dying from a gangster's bullet and that a surgeon is willing to perform an operation to graft his corneas onto Tony Quinn's eyes so that he can see again. The operation is done in secret and when the bandages are removed four months later, Quinn finds that he can not only see normally but can even see perfectly in darkness too. While blind, Quinn had developed the necessary skills of the blind; sharper hearing, more sensitive touch, a better sense of smell, etc. The other characters Like many other crime fighters, Quinn is unhappy about all the criminals who slip through the law's net on legal technicalities, etc. and decides to work outside the law in another persona to bring them to justice, and so the Black Bat is born, with Quinn deciding to keep the role of a blind man and later acquires the title of \\"Special District Attorney\\". Con man, Norton \\"Silk\\" Kirby, a small-time crook who had tried to rob Tony Quinn (when sighted) one night and had been persuaded to stay on as \\"officially\\" a valet and this continued after Quinn was blinded. His many criminal skills are a valuable asset to the Black Bat. Carol, a \\"resourceful and intelligent girl\\" who is already working undercover in a gang decides to work with Quinn on his secret crusade and last comes Jack \\"Butch\\" O'Leary who risked his life to save a crowd from machine gun fire. None too intelligent but completely loyal and \\"a hulking giant of a man who was never happier than when his fists were flying in defense of the law and in the aid of the Black Bat\\". Quinn has a secret tunnel to a gatehouse at the rear of his house which leads to a quiet street, which he uses as the Black Bat. This is necessary not just because of criminals who want him dead but because of the police too as he works outside the law. Friend to Quinn, the bulky lieutenant, Captain McGrath (under Commissioner Warner) who is so honest he would turn in his own mother if she did something wrong is also enemy of the Black Bat. He suspects they are one and the same (same build, similar voice) and often tries to prove it, with tricks, even once having a doctor examine Quinn's eyes. While Quinn can see perfectly, he can also make his eyes appear like those of a blind person and even a doctor is fooled. Quinn usually turns the tables on McGrath, making him look foolish in his attempts to prove he is the Black Bat. Pulp hero Covers of the Black Book Detective where Black Bat was the main story with some back-up stories were normally dark and featured a crime being committed while in the background shadows is the symbolic face of a brooding Black Bat looking on. Few covers broke with this tradition, like #27 where the Black Bat is seen being attacked by a huge dog and a knife wielding woman. Unlike many heroes of the pulps, the Black Bat did not come up against the fantastic but battled ordinary criminals who prey on the weak and helpless. The stories were detective stories too with the criminal and details revealed in the last pages by Quinn. Issue 7 has the Black Bat fighting against a gang of arsonists burning down tenement buildings for insurance money, regardless of who dies in them. Issue 11 has the Black Bat investigating a strange plane crash as well as a missing fortune in diamonds, needed for America's war effort. Russia initially started the war on Germany's side so issue 12 deals with Russian spies who commit sabotage and murder in America. Issue 13, a fiend uses a hospital for illegal and deadly experiments, even punishing his own men with horrible torture if they fail him. Issue 19 has a man who is believed to be the Devil but the Black Bat reveals his trickery. Issue 25 has Nazi fifth columnists steal a supply of bauxite (aluminum ore) which America desperately needs for the war effort. Issue 27 (around this time, page count of the BB stories started dropping due to a paper shortage, to about 45 pages for a time) Prohibition is over so ex-bootleggers move into the commodity market, stopping supplies getting through. Issue 28 features a criminal hypnotist. Issue 36 (Artwork is usually checked for \\"taste\\" but this one got through. A woman on the front cover who is obviously not wearing a bra.) One by one, people who know a secret start dying. Issue 38, a man convicted of murder has the Black Bat convicted of charges too on which he must acquit himself. Issue 39 Crooks plan to attend a rich party as detectives and steal two million in diamonds. Issue 40, the death predictions of a man prove too accurate so the BB investigates. Issue 41, in a 73-page story, a killer plots to control the Sentinel newspaper. Issue 44, a jailbreak and bank loot vanishes. The third Black Bat In 2011 Anthony Quinn is stated as dead in the Clockwork Comics series Education of a Superhero by Adam Dechanel and a new Black Bat under the alias Steve Ventura took on the daunting legacy. Legacy of the Black Bat is an ongoing series created by Paul Hobbs and Adam Dechanel. Ventura, a former reluctant assassin, has vague memories of Anthony Quinn's past suggesting he is a clone of some kind. In addition to this he also has access to all the Black Bat's former hidden weaponry and tech arsenal in the Bat Crypt. Anthony Quinn's former teenage sidekick Jeremiah Graymalkin helped Ventura begin his new life as the new Black Bat.

The Mask appears in the first twenty issues of Exciting Comics. Moonstone Books included the Black Bat in a new series of comics based on public domain pulp heroes called \\"Return of the Originals\\", which began in September 2010.

The arena was constructed to replace the Oshawa Civic Auditorium. The main tenant is the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League, and formerly the Durham TurfDogs of the Canadian Lacrosse League. It features the Oshawa Sports Hall of Fame, Prospects Bar and Grill, an Oshawa Generals retail store, executive seating and special club seats. The name was changed to Tribute Communities Centre on November 1, 2016. History The Tribute Communities Centre is owned by the city of Oshawa. On October 5, 2006, General Motors obtained the naming rights of the arena. The City originally selected Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE) to manage the building but, after disappointing results in the first year and a half, MLSE requested in March 2008 that its contract be terminated. MLSE had been attempting to get into the business of managing facilities beyond those where their sports teams played but decided to withdraw, with Bob Hunter, MLSE's Vice President of venues and entertainment, saying that managing the arena was \\"no longer a strategic focus for us\\". Global Spectrum assumed control of the operations and management of the arena on June 30, 2008. On April 14, 2016, they announced an agreement to replace the videoboard in the building. It meets Canadian Hockey League requirements for a future Memorial Cup bid, and replaces the old videoboard, which was a point of contention for Generals fans over the past few years. An announcement was made on October 7, 2016 that the facility would be renamed the Tribute Communities Centre effective November 1, 2016. The new naming rights are currently set to last for ten years. 2015 Pan American Games For the 2015 Pan American Games the facility hosted both weightlifting and boxing events.

It was produced during the period between the First World War and the Second World War. The B-534 was perhaps one of the most well-known Czechoslovakian aircraft of the era. During 1932, work had commenced on the development of a new single-engined biplane fighter aircraft, the Avia B-34, which had been designed by aeronautical engineer Franti≈°ek Novotn√Ω. During its development, various alternative engines were considered and trialled before eventually settling upon the license-built Hispano-Suiza 12Y engine. Other improvements during the prototype stage included the adoption of an enclosed cockpit along with a revised tail and undercarriage arrangement. On 14 April 1934, the second prototype, while flown by test pilot V√°clav Koƒç√≠, successfully attained a Czechoslovak national speed record of . Deliveries of production aircraft to the Czechoslovak Air Force commenced in October 1935. Partially as a result of its impressive maneuverability, as well as some operators continuing to maintain a preference for the established biplane configuration over the incoming generation of monoplane fighters that would soon prove to outperform them, the B-534 stayed in production for considerable time (1933-1939). During the late 1930s, Czechoslovakia sought to expand production of the type in response to German claims over the Sudetenland (the western border area of Czechoslovakia). Large numbers of the type saw combat with multiple nations during the course of the Second World War. While relatively ineffective in combat during the later stages of war due to its obsolescence, the type formed a sizeable proportion of several country's military aviation components. Development=Origins During 1932, the Czechoslovak aircraft company Avia flew the first prototype of a single-engined fighter biplane, the Avia B-34, designed by aeronautical engineer Franti≈°ek Novotn√Ω. After modification, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defence placed an order for B-34s.Air International July 1974, p. 26. A second prototype, the Avia B-34/2, was built, which was intended to be powered by a Avia Rr 29 radial engine instead of the Hispano-Suiza 12N V12 engine of the first prototype and the initial production series. This engine proved prone to overheating and vibration, however, and it was decided to re-engine the B.34/2 before it flew, fitting it with a Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs V12 engine.Air International July 1974, pp. 26‚Äì27. B-534.1, the first prototype of B-534 The Avia B-34/2 made its maiden flight on 25 May 1933. The prototype was sent for testing in September and was redesignated B-534.1.Air International July 1974, p. 27. On 10 September, the B-534 was displayed to the public for the first time at an Army Air Day. It was to compete against the Praga E-44 and Letov ≈†-231.Krybus 1967, pp. 3‚Äì4. A second prototype, the B-534/2 was completed in September 1933.Krybus 1967, p. 3. It differed from the first prototype by having an enclosed cockpit, and a revised tail and undercarriage. On 14 April 1934, the second prototype, while flown by test pilot V√°clav Koƒç√≠, successfully attained a Czechoslovak national speed record of . Initial production More testing followed and an initial order for 34 aircraft for the Czechoslovak Air Force, soon increasing to 147, was placed on 17 July 1934.Air International July 1974, pp. 27‚Äì28. At that time, the B-534 was well ahead of its contemporaries. The United Kingdom was still dependent on Hawker Furies, with the first Gloster Gladiators being produced at this time. The Soviet Union was placing its hope on its Polikarpov aircraft designs. The United States was still using descendants of the Curtiss Hawk series, with the Seversky P-35 and Curtiss P-36 about to fly as prototypes. B-534, early variant The B-534 was designed as a single-engine biplane fighter with a license-built Hispano-Suiza inline powerplant, and fixed landing gear. The air forces of the 1930s were reluctant to abandon the maneuverability and climb rates of biplanes for the speed of monoplanes, even in the face of new and better technology. The success of Soviet pilots with biplanes may have contributed to this reluctance; they were known to strip their aircraft of sliding canopies, preferring to have the wind in their faces. Aircraft with two fabric-covered wings and fixed landing gear were also less expensive to manufacture. First deliveries of the B-534 to the Czechoslovak air force began in October 1935, and 568 had been completed by 1939. The first 100 of these were of the first series. The second prototype was the blueprint for the I series, although it was built with an open cockpit. These early series aircraft were initially armed with four 7.92mm vz.28 guns. Two were located in the nose on either side of the engine in a similar manner to the Avia B-34 and two were fitted in the wings. At an early stage of production, it was however recognised that the wing-mounted guns were troublesome. Aircraft from serial number B-534.47 were completed without the wing guns, which were also removed from the earlier aircraft. The first to fourth series aircraft were fitted with the Avia licence-built version of the Hispano-Suiza 12Ydrs engine. This was a liquid-cooled V12-cylinder engine with a capacity of 36.05 litres. On the ground its normal power rating was 650 hp, it could deliver 750 hp for two minutes. At an operational height of 3,000 m (9,842 ft), it could deliver 850 hp for 30 minutes. At an operational height of 4,000 m (13,123 ft), it could reach 860 hp. Total fuel was 347 litres (76 gal) which was held in two fuselage fuel tanks of 90 and 257 litres. Further development B-534, 3rd variant The II series completed the remainder of the first order from the Czechoslovak Government, These were 45 aircraft numbered B-534.102 to 147. Like the I series these carried four guns. However the solution to the problems with the wing-mounted guns was to move these guns, now upgraded to the vz.30 to the fuselage with the others. The four 7.92 mm (0.312 in) machine guns were located on the sides of the fuselage, firing through the propeller.B√≠l√Ω, Miroslav and Ji≈ô√≠ Vran√Ω. Avia B-534: Cz. Fighter, 3rd and 4th Version, 2008, pp. 42‚Äì44, One very modern innovation was a bubble canopy; this had been tested on a small number of the early series aircraft, although it certainly was not a standard fit. During 1936, a second order for 46 aircraft were issued by the government. The first 25 of these were the B-534/III version serial numbers B-534: 148‚Äì173. Production took place in the second half of 1936. It entered service between March and April 1937. The III series had aerodynamic refinements which saw the streamlining of the front carburator air intake. Mudguard spats were also often added at the factory to the main gear.Krybus 1967, p. 4. The remainder of the second order from 534.174 to 534.193 were the IV series. With later orders the fourth series would occupy the serial numbers .174 and 445 and was therefore the most numerous of the types. The most important change to the earlier series was the enclosed cockpit. The IV series also enjoyed a metal light alloy Letov (Hochfeld) Hd-43 propeller. The various refinements allowed the IV series to have an increased speed of over 200 mph, and this placed it on par with the best of its contemporary biplanes. A common alteration to the IV series was the replacement of the tailskid with a tailwheel. Operational experiences had shown that the spat on the main landing gear could become clogged with mud on grassy airfields and cause takeoff and landing problems. The spats were then often removed. During 1937, the superb performance of the B-534 was demonstrated at a flying exhibition. The aircraft was tested against the best in the world at the IV International Air Meeting at Zurich's D√ºbendorf airport. The B-534 entered three of the competitions. The first of these tested climbing and diving. A GermanBf 109 took first place and a Henschel Hs 123 pilot pushed his biplane to claim second. The B-534 took the next three positions. The 534 outflew every other fighter participating, bar the Messerschmitt Bf 109 ‚Äì and even then, the Avia was only 11 km/h slower than the German aircraft. Four subtypes were produced during the B-534's production run, all with mostly minor improvements. Allegedly, problems were encountered with the redesign effort to adapt to installation of a newly installed cannon. These were not resolved in the summer of 1938; by this point, Czechoslovakia, sensing rising political tension amongst German claims to Czech-held territory, was eager to get more aircraft in the air, Avia decided to use a third machine gun in the nose. Judging by the size of the gun magazine, the nose machine gun was matched with an increased supply of ammunition.Avia B-534, Ji≈ô√≠ Vran√Ω, 1994, pp. 36‚Äì37, For the nation, time was running out and drew to Munich Diktat, at which point Germany commenced its occupation of the Sudetenland (the western border area of Czechoslovakia). Two series were produced Bk-534, cn's 501 ‚Äì 554, and cn's 555 ‚Äì 620. Only three of the second batch were completed for the Czechoslovak air force, and the remaining 63 aeroplanes from this production block were finished for the Germans, after the German invasion of the remainder of Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939. Design Bk-534 The Avia B-534 was a single-seat unequal-span biplane fighter aircraft.Krybus 1967, p. 5. The fuselage used a rectangular structure composed of steel tubes, which were attached together using a mixture of bolts and rivets and braced together using streamline wires. The wing, which had a riveted steel structure and fabric covering, was attached to the fuselage using N struts; similar struts were present in the outer section of the wings attaching the wings together. The forward section of the fuselage was covered with detachable metal panels, while the rear section had a fabric covering. Production aircraft were exclusively powered by the Hispano-Suiza 12Y 12-cylinder water-cooled engine, rated to produce a maximum of 850 hp, which was built under license by Avia. The total fuel capacity was 70 gallons (320 litres); a combined cooler and oil tank was installed beneath the fuselage, while a water-based radiator was also set below the engine. Engine ignition was provided via the cockpit, along with automated fire-fighting equipment. Other cockpit equipment included a radio set, oxygen provision, and an adjustable seat and cockpit cover. Early-built aircraft featured an open cockpit, while later-built examples were furnished with an enclosed cockpit.Krybus 1967, pp. 4‚Äì5. The B-534 was furnished with a monoplane tailplane, composed of steel and covered by fabric; similar construction methods were used for the fin and rudder. Both the rudder and the elevator were statically and aerodynamically balanced. The undercarriage was of a split-type configuration, being oleo-sprung and equipped with Dunlop-built wheels. The wheels, which were housed within streamlined fairings, were fitted with brakes; for conducting operations under winter conditions, skis could also be fitted to the undercarriage. According to reports from pilots who flew the B-534, it possessed excellent handling characteristics for the era. The Bk-534 was designed to carry one 20 mm (0.79 in) Oerlikon FFS-20 cannon firing through the nose, along with a pair of 7.92 mm (0.312 in) machine guns to the sides of the fuselage. By the summer of 1938, Czechoslovakia, sensing rising political tension caused by German claims to Czechoslovak border territory, was eager to get more aircraft in the service, thus Avia decided to use a third machine gun in the nose. However, there have been claims that the company had encountered substantial difficulties in adapting the aircraft to accommodate the additional weapon and these were not quickly resolved. Judging by the size of the gun magazine, the nose machine gun was matched with an increased supply of ammunition. Consequently however, the fuel load was decreased Operational history=Czechoslovakia Avia B-534, 42nd letka (squadron) Upon its introduction to squadron service with the Czechoslovak Air Force during the latter half of 1935, the B-534 was put to use in the interceptor role.Krybus 1967, pp. 5‚Äì6. Initially, the responsibility for pursuit and aerial combat was shared with several other aircraft, including the Avia BA-33L and the Letov ≈†-31; however, by 1938, the B-534 was the sole type of aircraft in Czech service to be tasked with this role. By 10 November 1938, a total of 370 B-534 and Bk-534 aircraft in service; additionally, 53 aircraft had been written off as a result of accidents.Krybus 1967, p. 6. On 1 September 1938, less than a month before the Munich Agreement would cause Czechoslovakia to lose 30 per cent of its territory and 34 per cent of its population,Rajlich and Sehnal 1994, p. 63. 328 B-534s and Bk-534s equipped 21 fighter squadrons of the Czechoslovak Air Force, while other aircraft were assigned to reserve and training squadrons, and deliveries continuing of the final batch of fighters.Air International July 1974, p. 33. On 14 March 1939, Germany forced the partition of Czechoslovakia, with Slovakia being declared as the nominally independent Slovak Republic with Germany annexing the remaining \\"Czech\\" part of Czechoslovakia as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia the next day.Krybus 1967, p. 7. The abrupt partition of Czechoslovakia during 1939 prevented any actual combat operations of the B-534 to be conducted by the nation that had produced it. By then, high performance monoplanes such as the Bf 109 and Britain's leading models ‚Äì the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire ‚Äì were raising the bar of fighter/interceptor standards. The Slovensk√© vzdu≈°n√© zbrane (Slovak Air Force) was organised out of the units of the Czechoslovak Air Force that were based in Slovakia at the time of partition, and inherited about 71 B-534s and Bk-534s. Slovakia had to quickly make use of its newly formed air force, weakened by the departure of many Czech pilots,Krybus 1967, pp. 6‚Äì7. to defend itself when neighbouring Hungary launched an invasion on 23 March 1939.Krybus 1967, p. 8. During the ensuing combat, a pair of B-534s were shot down by Hungarian anti-aircraft fire while a further four were claimed to have been shot down by Hungarian Fiat CR-32 fighters. Another Avia was compelled to perform a forced landing behind Hungarian lines and was captured.Rajlich and Sehnal 1994, pp. 64‚Äì65. During September 1939, Slovakia participated in the German Invasion of Poland; the nation held the aim of regaining territories which had been previously lost to Poland at Munich.Krybus 1967, p. 9. A pair of squadrons of B-534s were assigned to support the invasion. In the theatre, these were typically used to escort Luftwaffe aircraft, such as the Junkers Ju 87 dive-bomber, on eight missions, during which a pair of B-534s were lost while the downing of a single Polish RWD-8 liaison aircraft was claimed.Rajlich and Sehnal 1994, p. 65. The same squadrons fought alongside the elements of the German military in the area of Ukraine during summer 1941. According to aviation author Josef Krybus, on this front, moral amongst the Slovak pilots was low and no significant victories were achieved during their deployment. During 1942, one of these squadrons was redeployed to Slovakia to conduct anti-partisan operations. Over time, a combination of obsolescence, the lack of spare components and the old Czechoslovak air force's proprietary fuel mixture (BiBoLi, or some other mix of ethanol, benzol and petrol) finally relegated the surviving B-534s to performing the trainer role and other secondary duties during 1943.Chant 1999, p. 28. The training role would have been the last operational service of the B-534s in Slovak colors if not for the Slovak National Uprising of September‚ÄìOctober 1944. The rest of the Slovak air assets did not turn-coat as expected and the leaders of the uprising were faced with using a rag-tag collection of leftover aircraft, including several B-534s stationed at Tri Duby airfield. On 2 September 1944, Master Sergeant Franti≈°ek Cyprich, just after testing a repaired B-534, downed a Junkers Ju 52 transport under Hungarian colors on its way to a base in occupied Poland. This was at once the first aerial victory for the Uprising and the last recorded biplane fighter air-to-air victory. As the Slovak National Uprising was desperate for available aircraft, Sergeant Cyprich was derided by his colonel for not trying to force the Junkers Ju 52 to land and be captured instead. The last pair of B-534s at Tri Duby were burned as the base was evacuated on 25 October 1944. Avia B.534.217 of Combined Squadron, in which Frantisek Cyprich shot down a Hungarian Junkers Ju 52/3m, September 2nd, 1944 Bulgaria During 1939, Bulgaria opted to procure a batch of 78 B-534s, well after the enactment of the Czech partition, from Germany, who had captured a large number of the type.Krybus 1967, pp. 9‚Äì10. The last batch of these aircraft were delivered from Czechoslovakia during March 1942. On 1 August 1943, seven of these aircraft were able to make two passes at American Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers returning from the raid on Ploie≈üti. Hits were scored but no B-24s were shot down and some of the B-534s that received damage in the combat, cracked up on landing. The B-534s saw little use as frontline aircraft as Bulgaria had also procured the more capable Bf 109E and the French-built Dewoitine D.520 monoplane fighters. After the anti-German coup of 9 September 1944, Bulgaria switched sides overnight. As such its B-534s were quickly pressed into use to conduct ground attacks against German units. On 10 September 1944, a flight of six B-534s were involved in a brief melee with six German Bf 109s at low altitude. One B-534 was lost, but the Germans quickly broke off, wary of both the low altitude and the B-534's manoeuvrability. Other operators During 1937, a batch of 14 B-534s was supplied to Yugoslavia; some of these aircraft were still in service when Germany launched the Invasion of Yugoslavia in early 1941. During 1937, a handful of fighters were delivered from Czechoslovakia to Greece, additional Greek B-534s appear to have been acquired from Yugoslavia as well.Krybus 1967, pp. 6, 10. During 1940‚Äì1941, these fighters were later used during the Greco-Italian War as part of efforts by Greece to resist the invading Axis forces. Following Germany's forced annexation of the remaining \\"Czech\\" part of Czechoslovakia as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia on 15 March 1939, large numbers of captured B-534s were impressed into the Luftwaffe. In German service, the type was heavily used as a fighter-trainer at several fighter pilot training schools; another major use was as a glider-tug and target tug, which involved those B-534s involved being outfitted with cables and release-gear. Germany was also took interest in potentially using the B-534 as a carrier-based aircraft. In order to evaluate its suitability for such a role, three aircraft were equipped with tailhook and underwent structural strengthening before the commencement of a flight test programme; however, none of Germany's aircraft carriers, the Graf Zeppelin-class, were ever completed. The B-534 also featured in the German propaganda movie Kampfgeschwader Luetzow in which the type was used as a stand-in for Polish PZL P.11, being painted in Polish Air Force markings.Krybus 1967, pp. 7‚Äì8. Germany also sold a number of the captured B-534s to its allies, reportedly at 40 per cent of their original cost. Following the German occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941, the Axis-aligned Croatian Air Force was created and supplied with B-534s by Germany, as well as the integration of remaining examples from Yugoslavia's own B-534s ordered prior to the outbreak of the conflict.

The film initially did not use the 1927 stage musical of the same name as a source, but scenes were later added into the film incorporating two of the songs from the musical as well as other songs. This version was released by Universal in two editions, one a silent film for movie theatres still not equipped for sound, and one a part-talkie with a sound prologue. The film was long believed to be lost, but most of it has been found and released on LaserDisc and shown on Turner Classic Movies. A number of sections of the soundtrack were found in the mid-1990s on Vitaphone records, although the film was made with a Movietone soundtrack. Two more records were discovered in 2005.  Plot  The eighteen-year-old Magnolia meets, falls in love with, and elopes with riverboat gambler Gaylord Ravenal. After Captain Andy dies, Magnolia, Ravenal, and their daughter Kim leave the boat and go to live in Chicago, where they live off Ravenal's gambling earnings and are alternately rich and poor. Finally, Parthy announces she is coming to visit at a time when Ravenal is completely broke, and, fearing her wrath, he abandons Magnolia and Kim, after which Magnolia finds a job singing at a local club and eventually becomes famous. Years later, Parthy dies, and Magnolia, who had long been estranged from her because of her attitude toward Ravenal, returns to the show boat. Magnolia and Ravenal are reunited on the show boat at the end of the film, and after Parthy's death, Magnolia gives her own inheritance money to her daughter Kim.  Cast and crew  Laura La Plante and Joseph Schildkraut in a scene from the film. Emily Fitzroy as Parthy Universal lobby card, 1929 The film stars: * Laura La Plante as Magnolia Hawks * Joseph Schildkraut as Gaylord Ravenal * Emily Fitzroy as Parthenia 'Parthy' Ann Hawks * Otis Harlan as Capt'n Andy Hawks and the Master of Ceremonies in Prologue * Alma Rubens as Julie Dozier * Jack McDonald as Windy * Jane La Verne as Magnolia as a Child/Kim * Neely Edwards as Schultzy * Elise Bartlett as Elly * Stepin Fetchit as Joe * Gertrude Howard as Queenie  Sound adaptation  These were the years in which film studios were making a transition from silent films to sound films and this version of Show Boat was made as a silent film. The studio panicked when they realized that audiences might be expecting a sound version of Show Boat because sound films had become so popular, and the film was temporarily withheld from release. Subsequently, several scenes were then reshot to include about 30 minutes of dialogue and singing. At first, the songs recorded for the film had nothing to do with the Broadway score. However, Universal began to fear that audiences might instead be expecting, rather than just the Ferber novel, a film version of the stage musical, which had become a smash hit and was still playing on Broadway at the same time that the 1929 film premiered. So, a two-reel sound prologue, featuring original Broadway cast members Helen Morgan (Julie), Jules Bledsoe (Joe), Tess Gardella (Queenie) and the Jubilee Singers singing five songs from the show, was added, and the movie was released both as a part-talkie and as a silent film without the prologue. Otis Harlan, who played Cap'n Andy in the film, served as Master of Ceremonies in the prologue, which featured legendary impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, producer of the stage musical version of Show Boat, and Carl Laemmle, the producer of the film, as themselves. In the actual storyline of the film, Laura la Plante, with a dubbed singing voice, performs five songs, two of them from the stage musical - \\"Ol' Man River\\" (which Magnolia does not sing at all in any other version of Show Boat), and \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\". Both of these songs were sung in circumstances entirely different from any version of the musical. The other songs that Ms. La Plante sang in the film were traditional spirituals such as \\"I Got Shoes\\" and (it is believed) \\"Deep River\\", as well as a coon song of the early 1900s entitled \\"Coon, Coon, Coon\\". Her singing voice was dubbed by soprano Eva Olivetti. It was long believed that an entirely new score was written by Billy Rose for the film, but according to Miles Kreuger in his book Show Boat: The Story of a Classic American Musical, this turns out to not be true. Rose wrote only one new song for the film, and the Broadway score was not dropped because of any suggestion by him, as is often claimed. The singing voice of Stepin Fetchit, who played Joe in the film, was provided by Jules Bledsoe, the original Joe of the 1927 stage production of the musical. Fetchit mouthed the lyrics to a popular song of the time entitled \\"The Lonesome Road\\", which, as sung on the soundtrack by Bledsoe, served as the film's finale instead of a final reprise of Ol' Man River, as in the show. The entire stage score, except for \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\", \\"Bill\\", \\"Ol' Man River\\", and the little-known songs \\"C'mon Folks! (Queenie's Ballyhoo)\\" and \\"Hey Feller!\\", were replaced in the 1929 film by several spirituals and popular songs written by other songwriters, and largely because of this, the movie was not a success. Most of the songs taken from the stage version were heard only in the prologue and in the film's exit music, not the film itself. It is likely though that the fact that it was a part-talkie may have played a part in its failure. The then- recent 1929 film version of The Desert Song, an all-sound film almost literally faithful to the stage musical of the same name, had been a huge success, and audiences were no longer willing to accept part-talking musical films. Several of the extant parts of the 1929 Show Boat have been combined and occasionally shown on Turner Classic Movies. Fragments of the prologue not included in the TCM showings, both sound and picture, were shown as part of A&E;'s biography of Florenz Ziegfeld, and have turned up on YouTube. However, in the TCM version, the visual print of the prologue sequence has been replaced with an \\"Overture\\" card.

Origins Until roughly Tudor times, the Scudamore/Scudemore surname (of which Skidmore is a variant) was mainly associated with a few aristocratic families in Herefordshire (at Rowlstone, Ewyas Harold and Holme Lacy), and also in Gloucestershire (at Westerleigh), and Wiltshire (Upton Scudamore), and Hertfordshire (at Rickmansworth). American genealogist Warren Skidmore has stated in his extensive research on the surname: \\"Up until Tudor times, Skydmore was Skydmore's cousin everywhere.\\" Ralph de Scudemer ('Scudemer' is believed to have been a lost place-name in Normandy) was a stonemason, brought over from Normandy by the English King Edward the Confessor before the Norman Conquest, around 1060, to help to build castles along the Welsh border, as the Saxons knew little of stone castle-building and were building castles mainly of wood. Meanwhile, the Normans were already masters of stonemasonry techniques. The first of these castles which de Scudemer helped to construct was at Ewyas Harold, Herefordshire. Although the castle no longer stands ‚Äì it had fallen into disrepair by the 16th or 17th century, and most of the stone from it was carried off and \\"recycled\\" to build or rebuild certain houses in the village ‚Äì its motte and keep, perched on a low hill overlooking the village, the River Wye, and the gently sloping Herefordshire countryside, can still be plainly seen a millennium later. De Scudemer is mentioned five times in the Domesday Book of 1086, often as an undertenant at the castles which he helped to build: Opeton (Upton Scudamore) in Wiltshire; Fifhide (later Fifield Scudamore, now Fifield Bavant, Wiltshire); an unnamed parcel of land at Ewyas Harold, which Warren Skidmore postulates was probably Kaureos, now Corras in Kentchurch; Poscetune (now Poston, Herefordshire); and Little Hatfield (Yorkshire East Riding). These lands can be traced over the next few generations ‚Äì in some cases, dozens of generations ‚Äì as they were passed down to the families and descendants of his three sons, Reginald, Walter, and Hugh. Scudamore descendants still occupy Kentchurch Court at Kentchurch, Herefordshire. This 'immigrant generation' is also the last generation in which the family's lands were known to have been equally divided among de Scudemer's three sons; by the next generation, the English laws of primogeniture had largely taken over. By the mid-12th century, the descendants of Ralph de Scudemer ‚Äì with elder son Reginald's successors taking over the family's caput at Upton Scudamore in Wiltshire, while Walter's descendants remained in Herefordshire ‚Äì were listed as witnesses to charters bearing the clearly Norman surnames \\"d'Escudamor\\" and \\"Escudamore.\\" (Youngest son Hugh's descendants soon largely disappeared from view.) These names would morph into the Scudamore surname over the next generation or two, and then later into \\"Skydemore\\" and \\"Skydmore\\" by 1400. The name \\"Skidmore,\\" sometimes also spelled \\"Skydmore,\\" is a variant of the earlier, but still extant surname \\"Scudamore.\\" As late as the 17th century, and possibly later, it is documented that some people of this surname used both names interchangeably. For example, a family might be known as \\"Skidmore\\" during the week, but be called \\"Scudamore\\" when attending church services on Sunday. By the sixteenth century, around the time that parish registers began to come into common use following the Reformation, the shorter variant \\"Skidmore\\" came to be more common, and began to appear in other areas of the United Kingdom where it had not previously been documented in the aristocratic or landowning families. It was also around this time that it ceased to be the case that \\"Skydmore was Skydmore's cousin everywhere,\\" i.e. it could no longer be said with certainty that all people using this surname were definitively descended from Ralph de Scudemer. \\"New\\" Skidmore/Scudamore families such as the large, proliferant ones in the western suburbs of Birmingham (often called the Kingswinford branch after the village of Kingswinford, now in Staffordshire) and \\"the Chalfonts\\" ‚Äì Chalfont St Giles and Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire ‚Äì could not be proven by traditional genealogical means to have been related to the earlier families in Herefordshire. By the 1600s, Skidmore families began to appear in the American colonies, and later in Australia, as well as many other places around the world.

Marie, Ontario, Canada. It opened on September 29, 2006, replacing the now demolished Sault Memorial Gardens. The new building was constructed directly next door to the former Memorial Gardens and incorporated its most distinctive feature, the Memorial Tower, into its plans. The block surrounding the arena is called \\"Memorial Square.\\" The Garden's primary tenant is the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League. Structure The main entrance to the facility is located in the north west corner of the building, adjacent to the Memorial Tower, in the corner where the box office is located. Concourse level There are major entrances to the concourse level from each of the four corners of the GFL Memorial Gardens. Located on the concourse level are four main concessions, as well as the Molson Canadian Hockey House restaurant, multiple beer stands, and a coffee vendor. On the west side of the concourse level is the Greyhound merchandise store. Event level The event level of the Gardens houses all dressing rooms for players and officials, kitchen facilities, multi-purpose and break-out rooms, as well as technical, storage, and shipping and receiving functions. Also included on the event level is the Greyhounds' dressing room complex which is equipped with coaching and training rooms, weight rooms, showers, and physiotherapy areas. Suite level The suite level of the Gardens houses 13 private suites, a VIP room located on the north end, media and broadcasting rooms, and administration offices for both the Greyhounds Hockey Club and City of Sault Ste. Marie staff. Private suites ranging in seating size from six to ten persons. The VIP Room seats 100 people.. Features The Gardens includes a $500,000 scoreboard with an installed video component with live broadcast (up to five cameras), replay and T.V. capability. Wireless internet access is available throughout the facility. The facility also includes a state-of-the- art $250,000 sound system. External features The block on which the Gardens is located is named \\"Memorial Square,\\" as it is located on the grounds of the former Sault Memorial Gardens, the Greyhounds' former home. Memorial Square features the Memorial Tower, the last standing remnant of the former Gardens; the tower was preserved and refurbished after the previous Gardens was demolished in the summer of 2006. The sidewalk in front of the GFL Memorial Garden's north end (facing Queen Street) features the Sault Ste Marie Walk of Fame, a series of markers honouring those from the Sault Ste Marie area who have made significant contributions to the community or their chosen field of work. The Walk of Fame was formally unveiled on September 30, 2006, during the grand opening weekend. Naming rights=Steelback Brewery Naming rights to the new building were purchased by Steelback Brewery of Tiverton for $1.35 million over ten years. The proposal was approved by Sault Ste. Marie's city council on May 29, 2006, in a 9‚Äì1 vote. The City of Sault Ste. Marie, in conjunction with Steelback, held an official logo unveiling for the Steelback Centre on Saturday August 26, 2006, at the Roberta Bondar Pavilion in Sault Ste. Marie. There the new logo was officially unveiled, along with a list of upcoming shows. In November 2007, Steelback Brewery filed for bankruptcy protection and defaulted on its second payment of $135,000 to the city. Ward 1 Councillor James Caicco was quoted in the January 17, 2008, Sault Star as saying, \\"nothing can be done until the court creditors protection process with Steelback Brewery is completed. If Steelback comes out of court protection as a restructured company, then we still have a contract with them. If it declares bankruptcy, options will be presented to city council that include searching for a new naming rights sponsor.\\" Steelback later terminated its deal with the city and the search for a new sponsor commenced. Essar Steel Algoma Inc. On July 23, 2008, the City of Sault Ste. Marie, along with Essar Steel Algoma executives held a press conference to announce that Essar Steel Algoma Inc. had purchased the naming rights to the new downtown entertainment facility. This deal had been rumored for weeks, but only confirmed a day before by a source to the Sault Star. The deal was worth $1.5 million for 10 years, and unlike the first contract with Steelback Brewery, the amount was paid upfront in a lump sum, instead of yearly payments. Essar also paid for all new signage for the facility as part of the deal. Jamie Caicco, councillor and chair of the sports and entertainment committee for the facility told reporters that 6‚Äì7 companies showed interest in becoming the new naming rights sponsor when the invitation was first sent out looking for a new name. GFL Environmental Inc. In May 2018, it was announced that GFL Environmental had signed a 10-year, $750,000 deal for the naming rights, beginning August 1, 2018. The arena was renamed GFL Memorial Gardens. Notable events On October 11, 2006, Ontario Hockey League commissioner David Branch announced that the 2008 OHL All-Star Classic had been awarded to the Greyhounds and the City of Sault Ste. Marie. The game was played at the Steelback Centre on February 6, 2008, with the Eastern Conference squad defeating the West in a shootout, 8‚Äì7. The Essar Centre hosted the 2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, Canada's women's curling championships. In January 2010, The Essar Centre was a part of the Olympic Torch Relay. The Centre hosted the torch as it made its way across Canada and the world on its way to the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. The Essar Centre hosted the CARHA world cup in March 2012.

It was directed in 1930 by G. W. Pabst, from a screenplay by Ladislaus Vajda based on the novel Vier von der Infanterie by Ernst Johannsen. The film shows the effect of the war on a group of infantrymen portrayed by an ensemble cast led by screen veterans Fritz Kampers and Gustav Diessl. The film bears a resemblance to its close contemporary, All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), an American production, although it has a bleaker tone, consistent with Pabst's New Objectivity work through the late 1920s. It was particularly pioneering in its early use of sound - it was Pabst's first \\"talkie\\" - in that Pabst managed to record live audio during complex tracking shots through the trenches. Westfront 1918 was a critical success when it was released, although it was often shown in truncated form. With the rise of National Socialism, the German authorities quickly judged the film to be unsuitable for the public for its obvious pacifism and for its denunciation of war, which propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels labelled as \\"cowardly defeatism\\". Some shots from the film were used for scene-setting purposes in a 1937 BBC Television adaptation of the play Journey's End. Plot In 1918 in France during the last months of the First World War, four infantrymen - the Bavarian (Fritz Kampers), a young man known as 'the student' (Hans-Joachim Moebis), Karl (Gustav Diessl), and the lieutenant (Claus Clausen) - spend a few rest-days behind the front. The student falls in love with a French peasant girl, Yvette (Jackie Monnier). Back at the front, the four suffer again the everyday hardships of war: dirt, trenches and danger of death. The Bavarian, Karl and the lieutenant become trapped when part of the trench collapses and the Student digs them out. Later they are mistakenly fired upon by their own artillery due to a misjudgement of distance and are again saved by the Student, who as a messenger risks his life to relay instructions to the soldiers setting the firing range of the artillery. Karl receives leave, returning to his starving home town and promptly catches his wife in bed with a butcher. Embittered and unreconciled, he returns to the front. In his absence, the student is stabbed in a melee; his body lying in the mud of a shell-hole, only one hand sticking out. An offensive by the Allies begins, supported by tanks, and a mass of French infantry breaks through the thin German lines. During the defensive battle against the French, Karl and the Bavarian are seriously wounded, covering the remaining members of the group. The lieutenant has a nervous breakdown and falls into insanity. Shouting \\"Hurrah\\" non-stop, he salutes a pile of corpses. He is admitted to the field hospital together with Karl and the Bavarian. While the lieutenant is being carried though the hospital, many injured soldiers can be seen. In a fever, Karl sees his wife again and dies with the words \\"We are all to blame!\\". He is covered up, but his hand is hanging out the side. A wounded Frenchman lying beside him takes the hand in his and says \\"comrades, not enemies\\". The final message \\"End\\" is displayed with a question mark.

Alfred Kerr writing in the Berliner Tageblatt in 1930 said of it: \\"Apart from anything, everything I saw in the winter, a sound film these days was my most deeply felt: because he exposes the face of war for non-participants in the rudest. The impression drowned weeks, months. One should perform every New Year's Day, once each year beginning; in every village, in every school; ex officio by law. What are plays \\" Quoted in Bandmmann and Hembus (1980) pp.19‚Äì21 In the Frankfurter Zeitung in the same year, Siegfried Kracauer wrote: \\"The urge to truthful reproduction of horror that prevails here outgrown two scenes, already almost exceed the limit of the expressible. One: a single battle ends with an infantryman is nipped in the swamp in front of everyone. (The fact that you can still see protrude from the bubbling mud later a dead hand, is unnecessary sensationalism.) The other is the front military hospital in the church with the maimed, nurses and doctors who can barely operate their craft farther from exhaustion.

The review aggregator rotten tomatoes records 9/9 positive professional reviews, with the average score 7.9/10. Walter Goodman, in his review in The New York Times on 22 November 1987, compares the film unfavorably to Lewis Milestone's All Quiet in the Westfront, stating: \\"Although the German work ... isn't nearly as moving as \\"All Quiet\\", it has a power of its own... Pabst is especially good at giving a gritty documentary quality to the battle scenes; the pointless slaughter comes through. The movie is weaker when it focuses on individual soldiers. ... The truth of the movie is all in the trenches.\\" J. Hoberman reviewed the film positively in The Village Voice on 10 May 2005, writing \\"The always protean Pabst made a brilliant adjustment to sound.\\"  Home video  The Criterion Collection releases the film in the 2014 2K digital restoration by Deutsche Kinemathek in Blu-ray and DVD formats.

Life  Born in Moravian town Napajedla, Firku≈°n√Ω started his musical studies with the composers Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek and Josef Suk, and the pianist Vil√©m Kurz. Later he studied with the legendary pianists Alfred Cortot and Artur Schnabel. He began performing on the continent of Europe in the 1920s, and made his debuts in London in 1933 and New York in 1938. He escaped the Nazis in 1939, fled to Paris, later settled in New York and eventually became a U.S. citizen.Whitney, Craig R., \\"Rudolf Firkusny Once Again Plays In Czechoslovakia\\". The New York Times, May 29, 1990. Firku≈°n√Ω had a broad repertoire and skillfully performed the works of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, and Brahms as well as Mussorgsky and Debussy. However, he became known especially for his performances of the Czech composers Bed≈ôich Smetana, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, Jan√°ƒçek, and Bohuslav Martin≈Ø (who wrote a number of works for him). Firku≈°n√Ω championed Dvo≈ô√°k's only piano concerto, which he played with many different conductors and orchestras around the world and also recorded several times. Originally, he performed the revised version made by his teacher Kurz and even arranged it further; yet in the end, he came back to the original Dvo≈ô√°k score. Firku≈°n√Ω was also a devoted chamber player, and among his most prominent partners were cellists Pierre Fournier, Gregor Piatigorsky, J√°nos Starker, and Lynn Harrell; violinists Nathan Milstein and Erika Morini; violist William Primrose; and the Juilliard String Quartet. He also gave many first performances of contemporary composers, not only Czech such as by his friends Martin≈Ø and V√≠tƒõzslava Kapr√°lov√° but also Howard Hanson, Gian Carlo Menotti, Samuel Barber, and Alberto Ginastera. Firku≈°n√Ω taught at the Juilliard School in New York, and in Aspen, Colorado as well as in the Berkshire Music Centre in Tanglewood. Among his students were Yefim Bronfman, Eduardus Halim, Alan Weiss, Sara Davis Buechner, Carlisle Floyd, Kathryn Selby, Avner Arad, June de Toth, Richard Cionco, Robin McCabe, Anya Laurence, Natasa Veljkovic and Carlo Grante. After the fall of the communist government in his homeland (the \\"Velvet Revolution\\" of 1989), Firku≈°n√Ω returned to Czechoslovakia to perform for the first time after more than 40 years of absence. This was acclaimed as one of the major events of his festival, along with the return of his compatriot and friend the conductor Rafael Kubel√≠k. Firku≈°n√Ω retained his remarkable talents well into his later years and, for example, played a full Dvo≈ô√°k-Jan√°ƒçek-Brahms-Beethoven sonata recital in Prague on 18 May 1992 together with the violinist Josef Suk (the namesake and grandson of his teacher, and great-grandson of Dvo≈ô√°k). He played only two times at the Prague Spring International Music Festival, first in 1946 performed Dvo≈ô√°k's piano concerto, and in 1990 he played the second piano concerto of Martin≈Ø. Firku≈°n√Ω won praise from his famous colleague Vladimir Horowitz, who once exclaimed, \\"Rudolf Firku≈°n√Ω can play Schubert, that's for sure. I heard him on the radio this afternoon ... playing the three Klavierst√ºcke. Beautiful!\\"Dubal, David, Evenings with Horowitz: A Personal Portrait, Amadeus Press, 1991, p. 101. And the noted piano teacher and critic David Dubal called Firku≈°n√Ω \\"the preeminent Czech pianist of the twentieth century.\\"Dubal, David, The Art of the Piano, A Harvest Book, 1995, p. 80. Firku≈°n√Ω died in Staatsburg, New York in 1994. In 2007, his ashes and those of his wife, Tatiana Nevolov√° Firku≈°n√Ω, were reburied together in an honorary place at the Central Cemetery in Brno, close to his first teacher, Jan√°ƒçek, and directly next to the grave of Czech composer Jan Nov√°k. In 2012, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of his birth, there was a large festival held by Brno's Jan√°ƒçek Academy of Music and Performing Arts to commemorate the centennial, featuring many of his former alumni from the Juilliard School. In 2013, the Prague Spring Festival established the Rudolf Firku≈°n√Ω Piano Festival held in Prague. His student Carlisle Floyd wrote his only Piano Sonata in the 1950s, for Firku≈°n√Ω, who performed it once, at a Carnegie Hall recital. It then languished until being taken up in 2009 by the 74-year-old Daniell Revenaugh, who studied it with the composer and made its first recording.Tabitha Yang (September‚ÄìOctober 2009) The Restoration of Carlisle Floyd.

Inspired by the life of Suzanne de Roug√© du Plessis-Belli√®re, known as the Marquise du Plessis-Belli√®re. Ang√©lique's marriage to Jeoffrey de Peyrac is thought to be parallel to that of the daughter of Madame de S√©vign√©, Fran√ßoise-Marguerite de S√©vign√© to the Comte de Grignan. In 1964, it was adapted into a film by the same title. Plot summary In Mid-17th century France, a young Louis XIV struggles for his throne, beggars and thieves haunt Paris and brigands roam the countryside. The fifth child of an impoverished country nobleman, Ang√©lique de Sanc√© de Monteloup grows up in the Poitou marshlands. Her logical destiny would be to marry a poor country nobleman, have children and spend her life fighting for a meager subsistence. Destiny has other plans in store for her. At 17, on returning from her education in a convent, she finds herself betrothed to the rich count, Joffrey de Peyrac (Joffrey Comte de Peyrac de Morens d'Irristru, Lord of Toulouse and Aquitaine), 12 years her senior - lame, scarred and reputed to be a wizard. For the sake of her family, Ang√©lique reluctantly agrees to the match but refuses the advances of her husband. Peyrac respects her decision and does not pursue his claim to conjugal rights, wishing to seduce her rather than use force. With the passing of months, Angelique discovers the talents and virtues of her remarkable husband - scientist, musician, philosopher - and to her surprise falls passionately in love with him. But Peyrac's unusual way of life is threatened by the ambitions of the Archbishop of Toulouse, and soon arouses the jealousy of King Louis XIV, who disliked nobles who were independent of the monarchy and tried to block them from developing power in their own regions by keeping them occupied at Versailles for most of the year. Louis, anxious about Joffrey's growing influence and fearful that he will start another Fronde and overthrow the monarchy, has Joffrey arrested and charged with sorcery. Ang√©lique tries to single-handedly take on the might of the royal court. She survives several murder attempts and overcomes insurmountable odds in an effort to save Joffrey from being burned at the stake, but to no avail. Alone and desperate, Ang√©lique plunges into the darkness of the Paris underworld, intent on revenge and fueled by her determination to survive. Ang√©lique realizes that her underworld existence is unfair to her sons, who belong to one of the greatest noble families in France. She works to regain her family's rightful inheritance that had been stolen from them by the monarchy. She blackmails her cousin Philippe du Plessis de Belli√®re, a favourite Marshal of the king, into marriage. Characters in \\"Ang√©lique, the Marquise of the Angels\\" *Ang√©lique de Sanc√© de Monteloup (Sagittarius, 1639) - Main protagonist, the second daughter and the fifth of ten children of the Baron Armand de Sanc√© de Monteloup, an impoverished lesser nobleman of a very old family line. Her mother, Adeline, who died while Ang√©lique was still in the convent, is a woman of few words and a proud, understanding mother. Angelique's mother spends most of her time in her garden tending to fruit trees and vegetables to supplement the family's limited income. The de Sanc√© children's robust health and youthful beauty are owed to their mother's efforts in the garden that allowed them to grow up freely in the countryside. *Jeoffrey de Peyrac de Morens d'Irristru (1627) - Ang√©lique's enigmatic husband, a righteous and rich Count of Toulouse, Prince of Aquitaine, whom she reluctantly marries and later loves deeply. As a highly celebrated troubadour he is known as \\"The Golden Voice of the Kingdom.\\" As a result of his profound intellect and skill with weaponry, he is often referred to as \\"The Great Lame Devil of Languedoc,\\" while those who fear him refer to him as \\"The Sorcerer.\\" Ang√©lique has two sons with him, Florimond (~4 May 1659) and Cantor (~27 January 1661). Florimond has a strong physical resemblance to his father, while Cantor inherits his talents. Jeoffrey was the youngest child of an impoverished Languedoc aristocrat of very ancient lineage. As in the Ancien R√©gime ways, the infant Jeoffrey was brought up by his wet-nurse until he reached school age, but the hometown of his Protestant wet-nurse was massacred by Catholic zealots during the religious conflict between the Catholics and the Huguenots. Jeoffrey's face was disfigured by the swords of the Catholic invaders and he was tossed from a window, resulting in his physical disability. He was recognized by a Catholic who plundered the ruined castle, and with Jeoffrey's foster sister Margot, they endured much hardship to return him to his mother, who nursed Jeoffrey back to health. Jeoffrey endures jeers and insults about his disfigurement and limp, causing him to retreat into his studies. At seventeen, already a profound scholar, Jeoffrey leaves his family and travels extensively to quench his thirst for knowledge. He returns to find his family gone and his inheritance divided among creditors. Jeoffrey recovers his inheritance and ends up becoming even more wealthy as a result of his formidable intelligence. *Louis XIV - Being the king of an already unstable realm, Louis is disturbed by Jeoffrey's widespread influence and the reported contempt he holds for those that abuse their power. Fearing Jeoffrey will overthrow the monarchy, he orders Jeoffrey's arrest for sorcery and oversees his execution. *Ma√Ætre Fran√ßois Desgrez - A poor but very shrewd lawyer, he is the only one willing to defend Jeoffrey in his trial. After Jeoffrey's death, Desgrez was forced to flee and later sold his law license and became a Lieutenant of Police in Paris. He remained Ang√©lique's friend and often comes to her aid. *Conan B√©cher - An Inquisitor, alchemist and Franciscan friar. He was chosen by the Archbishop of Toulouse to observe Jeoffrey's gold processing technique. Instead of acknowledging it as a valid scientific technique, B√©cher condemned everything shown to him as heresy. He uses his influence to push Jeoffrey's death sentence at the stake, forcing Ang√©lique and others associated with Jeoffrey into hiding to avoid being hanged or sold into slavery. *Baron Beno√Æt de Fontenac, Archbishop of Toulouse - Also known as the Grand Inquisitor, a very avaricious man who secretly desires power like that of Cardinal Richelieu. He continually seeks to destroy Jeoffrey and to obtain his secret of processing gold. Upon hearing of Jeoffrey's arrest, the people of Languedoc knew it was instigated by the Archbishop. Mass protests and riots against the Archbishop result, lasting until the King himself forcibly put a stop to it. *Chevalier de Germontaz - A boorish and greedy nephew of the Archbishop of Toulouse. He was put to death as an example to others by the hand of the watchful and jealous Jeoffrey. His death served the Archbishop in further condemning Jeoffrey. *Ma√Ætre Molines - A Huguenot steward who manages the finances of the de Sanc√©s' and the du Plessis' estates and Jeoffrey's Poitou business contact. It was Molines who originally proposes the marriage between Jeoffrey and Ang√©lique, and he later assists with Ang√©lique's marriage with Philippe. Molines loves Ang√©lique like a daughter, and often it was he who would give her helpful advice. *Barbe - A nursemaid in Hortense's service, she is entrusted with Ang√©lique's sons, but when Hortense's family was forced to flee, she had to find work elsewhere. Ang√©lique finally found her again while she was working at Ma√Ætre Bourjus' The Brazen Cock. Then became permanent nurse to her sons after Ang√©lique's return to affluence. *Kouassi-B√¢ - A Moor in Jeoffrey's service as bodyguard and indispensable assistant in his studies in the natural sciences. He was forced to flee after Jeoffrey's death but was captured and sent to the King's galleys. *Fritz Hau√´r - A Saxon miner, Jeoffrey's other indispensable assistant in his study of the natural sciences and manages his mining operations. Like Kouassi-B√¢, the loyal miner risked his life chosen to help Jeoffrey at the trial. *Marquis Bernard d'Andijos - A Toulousain playboy nobleman, just like P√©guilin Antoine Nompar de Caumont, Duke of Lauzun, both are good friends of Jeoffrey. He acts as Ang√©lique's proxy bridegroom on her wedding in Monteloup. After Jeoffrey's death he led a rebellion in Languedoc against the King for Jeoffrey's sake. *Cl√©ment Tonnel - A spy and extortionist working under Nicolas Fouquet. He shadows Ang√©lique, working as a major-domo in Jeoffrey's palace. Have several times attempted on Ang√©lique's life and helped in bringing ludicrous heretical evidence against Jeoffrey. *Carmencita, Duchess of M√©recourt - One of Jeoffrey's mistresses whose connection he had long severed when he married Ang√©lique. The flighty and pleasure-loving Duchess became embittered against Jeoffrey when he refused to resume relationship with her and plays a part in condemning Jeoffrey in his trial for sorcery. *Nicolas Merlot - A shepherd in the service of Ang√©lique's father, along with Valentin, a miller's son, they are Ang√©lique's childhood friends. On the day of Ang√©lique's wedding he escaped Poitou to become Calembredaine, \\"the Illustrious Scamp\\", a bandit leader of the Parisian underworld. It was under his protection when Ang√©lique was cast out from her society after Jeoffrey was burned at the stake. *Philippe du Plessis de Belli√®re (1637) - Ang√©lique's more prominent nobility, vain, and arrogant cousin, whose family estate runs next to her father's and who happens to be her secret love in her teenage years. Because of his parents' ambitions for power, Philippe had a very neglected upbringing, which resulted in him being a brutal misogynist when Ang√©lique married him. In order to secure for her sons their rightful inheritance, she blackmailed the King's favourite Grand Marshal, this \\"Handsomest man in the Court\\" into marriage. *Raymond de Sanc√© - Ang√©lique's second eldest brother, who against the wishes of his father, became a Jesuit priest instead of staying at home to inherit his inheritance. Especially after Josselin, Ang√©lique's eldest brother, prevented by the family from joining the King's navy, ran away to America. The resourceful Raymond would often make himself available to aid his younger siblings whenever they are in difficulties. *Hortense de Sanc√© - Ang√©lique's eldest sister, she married a cousin of the minor de Sanc√© branch, Gaston Fallot, a respected procurator in Paris. Her family suffered much for being involved with Ang√©lique after Jeoffrey's arrest. *Gontran de Sanc√© - Ang√©lique's third eldest and closest brother, he ran away to Paris to become a painter and was disinherited by his father in the process, as artisans are classed beneath the nobles. He has preternatural ability in the depictions of his sitters in his paintings. *Guillaume L√ºtzen - An old German mercenary in the Baron de Sanc√©'s service. Mainly to protect the Monteloup castle and its inhabitants, especially the de Sanc√© women, from brigands, soldiers, and worse, tax collectors. He is very dear to Ang√©lique. *Fantine Lozier - Nurse to the de Sanc√© children. Often would tell her charges scary stories about Gilles de Rais or their family's ghost. *Pulch√©rie and Jeanne/Marthe de Sanc√© - The Baron Armand de Sanc√©'s unmarried sisters. Most likely due to lack of dowry. *Madelon de Sanc√© - Ang√©lique's younger sister, who died in a plague-ridden famine during the Fronde while she, Hortense, and Ang√©lique were educated in the convent. *Denis de Sanc√© - Ang√©lique's fourth brother, who succeeded his father's expectation by going into the service of the King's army. *Marie- Agn√®s de Sanc√© - Ang√©lique's youngest sister, who became a Maid of Honour to the Queen of France and then retreated into a convent. *Albert de Sanc√© - Ang√©lique's fifth brother, he became a page in the household of Monsieur's, the King's brother. *Jean-Marie de Sanc√© - Ang√©lique's sixth brother, he was on his way to becoming a priest. *Brother Anselme and Brother Jean of the Nieul Abbey - After Josselin fled to America, Ang√©lique, Nicolas and a band of urchins wanted to try their luck too. However they got lost in the Nieul forest and were sheltered by the kind-hearted Brother Anselme. Brother Jean rescued Ang√©lique from being perverted by some of the novices. Meanwhile, for his act of kindness, when he personally escorted the children back to their families, Brother Anselme was rewarded with abuses hurled at him. *Father Vincent - Ang√©lique met him during her stay at the convent. He prevented her from being ravished and convinced her to leave her rebelliousness to pursue her studies more seriously. As well as having a hand in transforming the young Henri de Roguier's life. This virtuous priest became Saint Vincent de Paul after his death. *Father Antoine - A Lazarist priest, a devoted follower of Father Vincent. He served as confessor just before Jeoffrey's execution and relayed messages between Jeoffrey and Ang√©lique. *Ma√Ætre Aubin - The King's public executioner. A good man for one with such a disturbing occupation and an equally disturbing wife. Uncle to Cordeau (Cord-around-the-neck) whose mother was landlady to Ang√©lique's secret lodging during Jeoffrey's trial. *Wood-Bottom Janir - Ang√©lique's friend during her existence in the Parisian underworld. He succeeded as the Great Co√´sre, ruler of the Parisian underworld, after Ang√©lique killed the former, Squat Rolin', in order to save Florimond from being sold into beggary. *Barcarole - a dwarf who befriended Ang√©lique and brought her to Calembredaine when she was an outcast and on the run from the King's police. He later became one of the jesters to the Queen of France and continued to help Ang√©lique whenever she was in danger. *Flipot - An orphan of Calembredaine's gang, became a pickpocket and Ang√©lique's faithful lackey. *The Polack - A camp-follower known as \\"The Marquise of the Polacks\\", was Calembredaine's mistress until Ang√©lique supplanted her. She became Ang√©lique's friend and taught her all sorts of self-defense tricks. *Linot - Another orphan in Calembredaine's gang, Ang√©lique saved him from being sold to Rotten-Jean, the sinister Trader of Children. Linot's vocation being a peddler by playing the hurdy-gurdy which his grandfather had left him, as well as selling waffles, pastries, etc. He was horribly killed during one of those dissipated sprees of the King's brother and his companions. *Claude le Petit - \\"The Gutter Poet\\", a pamphleteer whom Ang√©lique at first wanted to kill for writing slanders about her and her husband during Jeoffrey's imprisonment. He later became her lover and she acquired his help to disgrace those responsible for Linot's and Ma√Ætre Bourjus' deaths, which resulted in him being hanged. *David Chaillou - Son of a spice importer from Toulouse, apprentice cook and orphan nephew of Ma√Ætre Jacques Bourjus, the keeper of The Brazen Cock tavern. It was after the tavern keeper's death that Ang√©lique had the opportunity to help in realising David's father's dream of patenting chocolate and making it available to the masses which in turn helped Ang√©lique to amass wealth and rise into upper society. *Ma√Ætre Audiger - Army cook, master chef specialised in confections and refreshments, then butler to the Count of Soissons, he tried to compete with Ang√©lique and David in the race for patenting chocolate in France, but ended up as their partner. He had wanted to marry Ang√©lique upon his first meeting her, but her marital thoughts were still very much for Jeoffrey. She however was passionate about him and tried many ways to tempt him as a lover, but the exemplary and pious Audiger wanted her only as his seemingly ideal wife and mother of his family. It was only when he learned that Ang√©lique was going to marry her cousin, Philippe, this ambition was a final blow to his impressions of her.

The term is recent, dating to the 1990s, and sometimes confused with the South Shore (a region southeast of Boston that includes eastern Norfolk and Plymouth counties, and does not overlap with the South Coast). Communities There are eleven Massachusetts municipals that are almost always included in the South Coast (total population: 306,588). Two Rhode Island towns may also be included. * Acushnet, Massachusetts * Dartmouth, Massachusetts * Fairhaven, Massachusetts * Fall River, Massachusetts * Freetown, Massachusetts * Little Compton, Rhode Island* * Marion, Massachusetts * Mattapoisett, Massachusetts * New Bedford, Massachusetts * Rochester, Massachusetts * Somerset, Massachusetts *Swansea, Massachusetts * Tiverton, Rhode Island* * Wareham, Massachusetts * Westport, Massachusetts *Sometimes included. Economy The \\"South Coast\\" label was born as a public relations effort to counteract the perceived stigma of former terms like \\"Greater Fall River,\\" \\"Greater New Bedford,\\" or \\"New Bedford-Fall River,\\" which conjured images, in many Massachusetts residents' minds, of depressed mill towns with run-down buildings and high unemployment. Local boosters, including The Standard-Times newspaper, began using the term in the mid-1990s in an effort to attract business to an area with \\"the Cape's climate,\\" \\"better infrastructure\\" and \\"relatively low land prices,\\" according to Standard-Times publisher William Kennedy.Jurkowitz, Mark. \\"Renaming the 'Armpit'\\". The Boston Globe, June 5, 1997. Transportation The major highways through the area are Interstate 195 (from Providence to Wareham, Massachusetts) and U.S. Route 6, which is the older route connecting Providence to Cape Cod. Highway access to Boston is provided by Route 24 and Route 79, both of which end in Fall River, and Route 140 which connects New Bedford to Route 24 in Taunton. Limited public transportation is provided by the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority, and the Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority. There is a proposal by the MBTA to connect Fall River and New Bedford to Boston through Taunton via commuter rail, but it does not yet have fully committed funding. As of 2019, Fall River, New Bedford, and Taunton are the only cities in Massachusetts within 60 miles of Boston, not to have rail service to Boston. Preliminary construction has taken place on the corridor. Freight service to Fall River is the main beneficiary of the South Coast Rail project at this current time. Capacity constraints at South Station are also delaying the project. The North-South Rail Link study by MassDOT will have an answer to the capacity issue by the spring of 2018. Media The term \\"South Coast\\" reportedly began with weather forecasts by Todd Gross on WHDH-TV in Boston. New Bedford's local daily newspaper, The Standard-Times, picked it up in the late 1990s, and other media have followed suit, albeit not without some protest by longtime area residents who protested the manufactured name. Other newspapers serving the area include The Herald News of Fall River; \\"The Standard Times\\" with an online entertainment subsidiary \\"southcoasttoday.com\\" of New Bedford; the Taunton Daily Gazette; The Providence Journal; and, for regional coverage, The Boston Globe and Boston Herald. Much of the broadcast media in the area is local to metropolitan Providence and Boston.

Aste was born in Rovereto near Trento, Trentino. He led the first Italian ascent of the Eiger north face in 1962, together with Pierlorenzo Acquistapace, Gildo Airoldi, Andrea Mellano, Romano Perego and Franco Solina. He also climbed for the first time the South Tower of Paine in Patagonia, one of the three Torres del Paine. Due to his numerous ascents in the Italian Dolomites, climbing routes have been named after him (e.g. the Aste-Susatti route in the Monte Civetta, near Belluno, Italy, first ascent by Armando Aste and Fausto Susatti on 26‚Äì28 July 1954). Further selected first ascents in the Dolomites by Armando Aste were: * Cima del Focobon, together with Franco Solina, 16‚Äì19 August 1958; * Piz Seranto south face, with Franco Solina, 10‚Äì15 August 1959; * Crozzon di Brenta, with Milo Navasa, 26‚Äì28 August 1959; * Marmolada d'Ombretta, with Franco Solina, 24‚Äì29 August 1964. Reinhold Messner was the first person who climbed this route again, which is called today the \\"Aste route\\" or \\"Via dell'Ideale\\". Jerzy Kukuczka was the first to dare the ascent at the end of winter (17‚Äì23 March 1973).

It follows four gay friends, Andy, Jarod, Nico and Griff, who vow upon graduating high school that they will all lose their \\"anal virginity\\" before their friend's Labor Day party. The film takes content from the 1999 teen comedy American Pie. A sequel, Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild!, was released in 2008. Plot The story centers around four gay friends who have recently graduated from San Torum High School. Andy (Michael Carbonaro) is an awkward, sex-crazed character who frequently masturbates with his mother's fruits and vegetables. Jarod (Jonathan Chase) is a handsome and fit jock who is quite insecure. Griff (Mitch Morris) is a nerdy, well-dressed guy who is secretly in love with Jarod. Nico (Jonah Blechman) is the most flamboyant, outgoing, and effeminate of the group. The four of them decide to make a pact to have sex by the end of the summer. Each boy proceeds to pursue sex in different ways, with both tragic and comedic results. Nico tries to secure an online date with a man named Ryder (Matthew Rush), but ends up with the grandfather (George Marcy) of their lesbian friend Muffler. Jarod seeks out fellow jocks, including a baseball pitcher named Beau (James Getzlaff), while Griff tries to earn the affection of Angel (Darryl Stephens), a male stripper; Jarod and Griff leave these men to have sex with each other instead, because they are in love. Andy, having failed to seduce his long-time crush, his math teacher, Mr. Puckov (Graham Norton), has a threesome with the rejected Beau and Angel. Much of the humor comes from how awkward each boy is at romance and how naive they are about sex. Each plot backfires horribly, until the boys finally begin to change their attitudes towards sex at the end of the film. Cast * Michael Carbonaro as Andy Wilson * Jonah Blechman as Nico Hunter * Jonathan Chase as Jarod * Mitch Morris as Griff * Ashlie Atkinson as Dawn Muffler * Scott Thompson as Mr. Wilson * Graham Norton as Mr. Puckov * Stephanie McVay as Bonnie Hunter * Lypsinka as Mrs. Wilson * James Getzlaff as Beau * Darryl Stephens as Angel * Richard Hatch as Himself * George Marcy as Grandpa Muffler * Megan Saraceni as Mini-Muff * Saudia Mills as Muffler Acquaintance * Andersen Gabrych as Tyler * Angela Oh as Tiki * Joanna Leeds as Daisy * Matthew Rush as Ryder * Mink Stole (deleted scenes) as Sloppi Seconds  Production  Todd Stephens' previous work revolved around gay teens, like Edge of Seventeen and Gypsy 83. The film was a result of Stephens difficulty in securing distribution of Gypsy 83 because the film was not \\"gay\\" enough. Stephens said \\"I was really angry when I wrote it. Very frustrated. And Another Gay Movie's what came out.\\" Actor Jonah Blechman initially refused the script, but became intrigued by his own shock to Stephens' script that he decided to join the project as the executive producer. Release and reception  On April 29, 2006, the film had its premier at Lowes Village East in New York. The film grossed $745,327 at the box office on a $500,000 budget. Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer described the film as \\"an unapologetic, un-P.C., in-your-face gay take on American Pie.\\" Kyle Buchanan of The Advocate reflected the positive impact of the film as a \\"...parody that felt necessary. Arriving during the heyday of Project Runway and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the film came as both confirmation of gay people's mainstream status and a built-in corrective to it.\\" The film was not reviewed favorably by Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post, who described the film as a painful derivative of the gross-out teen comedy. Ed Blank said the campy vulgarity of the film caters to a niche audience, but the film \\"delivers an abominable ensemble performance in an unplayable script\\".

It spread heavy snow across the major cities of the Northeastern and Mid- Atlantic states, making it the defining snowstorm of the very snowy winter of 2002-2003. All cities from Washington DC to Boston were covered in of snow and those cities were brought to a standstill due to problems caused by temperatures and the snow. In Baltimore and Boston, this was the biggest snowstorm on record, with 28.2 and 27.5 inches (71.6 and 69.9 cm) respectively. Synoptic setup The severity of the Blizzard of 2003 can be attributed to the unusually favorable atmospheric conditions surrounding the storm (synoptic conditions). Most notably, the storm allowed for cyclogenesis off of the coastal Carolinas, a feature that is common to most major winter storms in the eastern parts of North America. This secondary system fed off the moisture of the Atlantic Ocean and enhanced precipitation totals from North Carolina to Massachusetts. Secondly, a high pressure system was in place over eastern portions of Canada, allowing for cold air to be brought down into the coastal areas in a process known as cold air advection. This cold air ensured that many areas where storms typically produce mixed precipitation received most or all precipitation in the form of snow. The life of the storm The storm developed in the southern Rockies on February 14, and moved through southern Missouri and the Lower Tennessee Valley during the next few days. It brought heavy rain, ice and severe weather to some areas of the South, including the nation's first tornado of the year. Farther north, snow and ice affected the Midwest. Southern Iowa and eastern Illinois also got significant snow, with 11 inches (28 cm) in Des Moines. In central Kentucky the storm produced mostly ice, with some locations including Frankfort, Lexington, and nearby Cynthiana in Harrison County receiving up to 3/4\\" (2 cm) of ice. Much of Ohio received heavy snowfall, with Mansfield receiving 21 inches and Columbus receiving about a foot. However, early on February 16, heavy snow started falling in those two cities, and the snow later developed in Philadelphia. Heavy snow was continuously reported, falling at rates of up to 4 inches (10 cm) per hour. In addition, temperatures were frigid, around 15 ¬∞F (-10 ¬∞C). The heavy snow continued all day, and it developed in New York City by the evening. At about the same time, the snow changed to sleet in Washington, D.C., and significantly lowered the accumulation. Throughout the rest of the Northeast, however, the snow continued for much of the night. The sleet changed back to snow by the next morning in Washington, D.C., and soon ended. By that time, a secondary low pressure system formed off the North Carolina coast and traveled north, turning the storm into a nor'easter for New York City and Boston. Blizzard Warnings were issued, and the snow began in Boston that day. In the evening, the heavy snow ended in New York City, and ended in Boston the morning of February 18. After that, the storm weakened and brought a few inches of snow to other parts of New England. The blizzard left the East Coast of the United States on February 19 and moved out into the North Atlantic Ocean. The storm weakened until it was completely absorbed by other systems on February 22.

All in all, it was the most significant and powerful storm to affect the major cities of the Northeast since the Blizzard of 1996. Washington's Reagan National Airport, Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport in New York City were shut down completely, and Dulles Airport had one runway open. With snow continually accumulating, road travel was nearly impossible. The B&O; Railroad Museum in Baltimore on February 17, 2003, shortly after its roof collapsed In Baltimore, the roof of the historic B&O; Railroad Museum built in 1884 collapsed, damaging many valuable engines, historic railroad cars, and train exhibits. Although the structure's central support columns remained standing, the supporting iron struts and ties of the destroyed roofing sections failed under the heavy snow load. Some items in the museum's collection were damaged beyond repair. Reporting on the devastation the following day, The Baltimore Sun said, \\"...hours after the collapse, columns of mangled steel stuck out from the roundhouse ... Locomotives and passenger cars in the museum's collection, some dating from the 1830s, could be seen covered with snow and debris\\". Parts of the Baltimore suburbs were some of the hardest hit areas of the blizzard. Snowfall totals in the towns immediately north of the city were estimated at between 38\\"-40\\" while the downtown city center recorded only 28\\" of snow. The difference in reported totals resulted in conflicting reports received by the Department of Transportation. This confusion in communications resulted in the towns with the highest amounts of snow receiving delayed assistance in the cleanup while the major roadways into and out of the city were cleared. Most Washington, DC area television stations had wall-to-wall coverage from Saturday morning through Monday evening, only stopping briefly overnight. Even overnight, they had constant information bars on the screen with the latest forecasts and emergency information. The University of Maryland baseball team was stranded in Florida for an extra 3 days following a tournament at Stetson University due to all flights being canceled in the Baltimore/DC area. The city of Albany, New York was shut down for three days. Many school districts affected by the blizzard closed schools for the week. The amount of snow accumulating on the roads forced some snowplows to plow the snow into parking lots, further contributing to school closures. Many schools announced during the storm that their facilities would be closed for the duration of the week following the storm. The University System of Maryland announced on Sunday, February 16 that their campuses would not reopen until Monday, February 24. The extended closure of school districts due to this storm exacerbated the task of scheduling make-up days for the affected students, as most of these districts had already used all of their previously allocated days on storms earlier in the winter. Some districts in New Jersey ended the school year as late as June 30, 2003. In Pennsylvania, Governor Ed Rendell declared a state of emergency early on the 17th which made state agencies available for assistance. It also freed counties from spending restrictions and allowed routes to be closed to non-emergency vehicles. The state also issued a travel advisory asking people to stay off the roads. Many municipalities (including Philadelphia) declared their own snow emergencies which banned non-essential travel and parking on snow emergency routes. There were two snow-related deaths within Philadelphia. In the southeastern part of the state, area malls closed early on the 16th and churches cancelled services. The weight of the snow caused several roof and porch collapses throughout the region, particularly around Philadelphia where the snow mixed with sleet. Most malls and shopping centers were closed on the 17th as many employees could not get to work. Funerals and elective surgical procedures were cancelled. Businesses, universities and government offices started to reopen on Tuesday the 18th, but most schools remained closed. Organizers had to postpone scheduled events. Even Girl Scouts could not deliver their cookies. Life returned closer to normal as the week continued. Volunteers helped hospital personnel get to and from work. Blood supplies though were down to about one day. Numerous accidents occurred in the southeast part of the state during the morning of the 16th. After that, the timing of the storm (during the holiday weekend) kept the number of accidents and rescues down. The fluffy nature of the snow led to few power outages. Most were caused by vehicles crashing into utility poles. In Philadelphia, a partially buried man was found in a snowpile on the 17th. On the 21st, a 79-year-old woman was killed after a snow-packed aluminum patio roof collapsed on her. On the 19th, a 24-year-old man was injured when his leg was trapped under the debris of a porch collapse. The worst building collapse occurred in a warehouse near the old Navy Yard. Damage to the roof and goods was 3.5 million dollars. Philadelphia International Airport remained open on the 16th, but closed on the 17th and stranded about 600 passengers at the airport. The Greyhound bus terminal closed on the 17th. SEPTA regional rail lines ran on weekend schedules through Tuesday the 18th. About 400,000 tons of snow were dumped into the Schuylkill River. The city estimated snow removal cost about 8 million dollars. It took until the 18th to plow side streets. The worst accident of the storm occurred early on the 16th as six vehicles collided near Academy Road on Interstate 95. In Delaware County, all trolley and bus routes were closed through the 18th as were schools and county offices. Snowmobiles were used to rescue trapped motorists. In Chester County, a major accident during the early afternoon of the 16th closed the eastbound lanes of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Morgantown and Downingtown for three hours. In Montgomery County, in Conshohocken, two people were killed in an early morning fire on the 17th. Firefighters were hampered by the ongoing storm. Lengthy delays occurred on the 16th on U.S. Route 422, the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. A string of porch collapses occurred on the 19th in Norristown. In Bucks County, a woman died of a heart attack. Emergency personnel could not reach her. The eastbound lanes of the Pennsylvania Turnpike near the Philadelphia Interchange were shut down during the afternoon of the 16th because of a multi-vehicle accident that set a couple of them ablaze. In Nockamixon and Bridgeton Townships, an avalanche closed a mile of River Road. Several drivers were stranded and had to be rescued. The snow was 10 feet high on the roadway. In the Lehigh Valley, even police cruisers were getting stuck in the snow. Non-four-wheel drive vehicles could not move. The Lehigh Valley International Airport remained opened, but most flights were canceled. There was no public transportation on the 17th. The blizzard was part of a winter remarkable for its snowstorms in the affected states, where total snowfall for the season ranked in the top ten and even higher in some areas. In sections of the coastal northeast, 75 inches of total snowfall occurred that year. Some Maryland communities getting more than three feet of snow in the President's Day blizzard, such as Kingsville and Perry Hall, experienced more than 80 inches of snow for the entire winter season. Other effects This storm was part of the same system that caused that year's Daytona 500 to be rain-shortened. Michael Waltrip won the race.

Frequently, the liquids in these tanks and pipes are toxic, and bunding is used to prevent the liquid from causing damage (either by force or its chemistry). If a large tank has a catastrophic failure, the liquid alone can cause extensive damage.\\"CIRIA C736, Containment Systems for the Prevention of Pollution\\",p38, Construction Industry Research and Information Association, London If built properly, bunding is large enough and strong enough to contain the contents of an entire tank, though regulations may require it to be up to a third larger.

The material used depends on cost, the chemical properties of the liquid and its density. Plastic tanks cannot hold very dense liquids at high wall levels. Large, exposed bunding will need a sump pump or some other system to remove precipitation, though it may also be used to transfer spilled liquid into another container.

Another design uses a channel that drains the liquid to a secondary container.\\"Guidance Note on Storage and Transfer of Materials for Scheduled Activities\\", Section 6.3.3.3 When the risk of tank failure is not as likely or when it would not cause extensive damage, the bunding may be designed to merely contain small leaks from hoses and valves. This bunding may not be able to contain the entire volume of the tank. Plastic and steel are used, but another common method is making a hump or lip around the perimeter of a concrete floor. Some bunding is temporary, such as short-term chemical storage in the field. A hump or slope type bunding is helpful when vehicles need access to the area. There is also a type of bunding that compresses when a vehicle passes over and expands once it has passed. Regulations Bund around the base of a tankBunding is a legal requirement in many countries, particularly around tanks, storage vessels and other plants that contain liquids which may be dangerous or hazardous to the environment.Susan Wolf, Neil Stanley. \\"Wolf and Stanley on Environmental Law\\", Chapter 4, Routledge Particular examples which receive specific attention in the UK, the rest of Europe and the USA are oil and fuel storage tanks and transformers at electricity sub-stations which are filled with oil for cooling and insulation purposes. In the UK commercial installations exceeding 200 litres and domestic installations exceeding 2500 litres require a bunded tank to comply with Environment Agency 'control of pollution regulations'. It is reasonably easy to construct a \\"water-tight\\" bund around the base of a tank or vessel. A concrete base and a sealed wall of masonry, brickwork, concrete or even prefabricated steel provides the holding capacity\\"Guidance to Storage and Transfer of Materials for Scheduled Activities, Section 6.3.1\\",\\"EPA, Wexford, Ireland 2004. Holding capacity Almost all regulations require a holding capacity of 110% of the largest tank within the bund or 25% of the total capacity of all the tanks within the bund, whichever is the greatest. In addition, further guidelines in some countries (e.g. the UK) recommend additional measures such as providing sufficient \\"freeboard\\" or height of wall above the maximum holding capacity to accommodate dynamic factors such as a surge in situations of major tank failure or storm-driven waves in larger bunds. As a rule (and unless specific local laws prevail) most operators work to the 25%/110% capacity guide.\\"Guidance to Storage and Transfer of Materials for Scheduled Activities, Section 5.3.1\\",\\"EPA, Wexford, Ireland 2004. Unwanted water build-up and removal As noted above, electricity sub- station transformers contain significant amounts of oil. A 110kVA transformer may have up to 40,000 litres of cooling/insulating oil contained within the body of the transformer and its associated coiling radiators and storage tanks. Unlike ordinary fuel storage tanks, these are complex structures, with a higher propensity for leakage of the oil. Using the UK as an example, as electricity industry privatization took place in the 1980s and 1990s the new electricity companies were made aware of their environmental responsibilities. Most area and national companies realised that they had several thousand transformers, many of which had been leaking into the ground below them for many years. The companies embarked on an upgrading programme involving the construction of \\"water-tight\\" bunds to retain any oil leakage and to prevent further pollution and contamination. They immediately encountered the problem of water build-up from rain being retained by the now \\"water-tight\\" bund; the unwanted rain-water reduces the holding capacity of the bund. Once the water level reaches more than 10% of the holding capacity of the bund, it is no longer fit for purpose and the water must be removed. The water is also likely to be, at best, moderately contaminated with a small film of oil on the top of it or, at worst, substantially contaminated by a thick layer of oil. This is worse on older, leakier transformers. This also can apply to any oil storage tank Oil floats on water and, if still clean enough to see through, has a different refractive index than the water below, making the oil/water interface difficult to judge. This makes manual pumping difficult and unsafe. Removing the entire contents for disposal as hazardous waste is expensive and environmentally unacceptable. However, in the UK at least, the latest regulations require some formal method to be put in place for the removal of the rainwater. One of the systems recommended is an automatic pump system which is able to discriminate between oil and water. A good system should work continuously and automatically and must fail to safety (e.g. not pumping). It should also provide alarms for conditions such as high water (indicative of pump or system failure) and high oil to warn that action to skim off the waste oil should now be done. These automatic pump systems are usually referred to as \\"BundGuards\\". Anti-noise In the UK, manmade earthwork structures are sometimes constructed around housing developments, especially near industrial sites. The mounds of earth with vegetation (normally shrubs and trees) diminish the noise from the industrial site. The bunds then create a more natural landscape instead of thick or high barriers. They can be built in curved or sinuous forms, depending on the landscape. Bunds are also used to protect housing from noisy transport routes such as motorways and railways. Re-greening Bunds can be used to hold rainwater in lightly sloping plains that have lost vegetation due to drought and overgrazing. The semi-circular bunds will hold the rainwater giving it time to penetrate the soil and rehydrate the seeds in the ground. Failures Bund wall failures have occurred in the UK, such as at Warrington, Cheshire in 1994. A polypropylene tank holding about 30 tonnes of 40% aqueous caustic soda sprang a leak about halfway down the main wall. The corrosive fluid jetted out over the bund wall, causing great damage to the surrounding factory and adjacent premises. The bunding at Buncefield also failed to contain petrol and fire fighting water after the initial explosion and subsequent fire. Integrity assessments Bunds will deteriorate over time (e.g. cracks may develop in concrete walls or reinforcement bars may corrode) or suffer damage (e.g. vehicle strikes) or modifications may have been made. To ensure that bunds continue to provide the necessary protection against leaks and spills, bunds should be assessed periodically to ensure that they continue to provide sufficient integrity (e.g. will not leak). National and local regulations often specify the frequency and method of bund integrity assessment. In the UK, for sites licensed by the Environmental Agency, the integrity assessment is normally annually. In Ireland, for sites licensed by the EPA, the integrity assessment is normally every three years. The actual permit or license for the site will normally specify the assessment interval. There are two assessment techniques in use, hydrostatic testing, and visual inspection. In certain circumstances, both techniques may be used.  Hydrostatic tests  Existing bund being hydrostatically testedThe general principles of hydrostatic tests are described in. These general steps consist of * filling the bund with water to a level that corresponds to the design capacity of the bund. * allowing a period of absorption of water into the walls of the bund. * the test itself. * assessment of test result. * disposal of the test water.  Visual inspection  A visual inspection requires that a competent person examine the bund to determine whether the bund, in their opinion, is in a suitable condition to retain the primary containment contents in case of a spill. The examination will include a visual inspection of the inner and outer walls and the bund base. In particular, joints in the walls and base will be examined and also where pipes penetrate bund walls. Any defects that are likely to cause a leak are noted. The definition of a competent person may be defined in the permit but is generally considered to refer to a Chartered Engineer with appropriate experience Where there is doubt as to the integrity, then the visual inspection may be supplemented by a low-level hydrostatic test.  New bunds  A new concrete bund ready for integrity testAll new bunds should be tested before they enter service. Test methods are usually specified in the design code used to design the bunds. Two design codes have been historically used throughout the UK and Ireland, BS8007:1987 and CIRIA163. BS8007:1989 has now been withdrawn and replaced by BS EN 1992-3:2006.BS EN 1992-3:2006. \\"Eurocode 2. Design of concrete structures. Liquid retaining and containing structures\\" British Standards Institution, London However, this withdrawn standard is still extensively referenced by many regulators and the testing requirements are identical in both standards. It is important that this testing is carried out before tanks, pumps or other equipment is placed in the bund. This is because tanks may try to float and thus become unstable and other equipment may be damaged by water immersion. Prefabricated bunds will have generally been tested at the factory where they are made and therefore should be accompanied by a test certificate.  Existing bunds  The guidance for assessment of existing bunds differs significantly between the UK and Ireland. In the UK, visual inspection for existing bunds is the preferred assessment method. , \\"Containment of Bulk Hazardous Liquids At COMAH Establishments. Containment Policy Supporting Guidance For Secondary And Tertiary Containment And Implementation Principles For Regulators\\" This is due to concerns re-tank stability and the possibility of promoting corrosion of the base of the tank. In Ireland, for site regulated by the EPA, hydrostatic testing is the preferred method unless there are safety or practical reasons why a hydrostatic test cannot be carried out Potential reasons as to why a hydrostatic test may be unsafe or impractical include * Tank stability. Tanks may try to float and may become unstable. * Corrosion of tank base. * Flooding of electrical equipment within bund. * Displacement of flammable or toxic gases that have built up in bund. * Tank contents may react with test water. * Impeded site operations, e.g. warehouses or other storage areas that need frequent access * Lack of containment capacity should the tank fail during the test. * Use of excessive quantity of water. In some cases, it may be necessary to test joints and bund penetrations (such as by pipes) for watertightness using a limpet dam or similar.\\"CIRIA C736, Containment Systems for the Prevention of Pollution\\", Section 7.5.3, Construction Industry Research and Information Association, London See also * Secondary spill containment *Storage tanks *Contour plowing Notable containment failures * London Beer Flood * Great Molasses Flood * 2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire References * Forensic Materials Engineering: Case Studies, Peter Rhys Lewis, Ken Reynolds and Colin Gagg, CRC Press (2004) for a discussion of plastic tank and bund failures. * Lewis, PR and Weidmann, GW, Catastrophic failure of a polypropylene tank, Part I Primary Investigation, Engineering Failure Analysis, 6, 197-214 (1999) * Lewis, PR and Weidmann, GW, Catastrophic failure of a polypropylene tank, Part II Comparison of the DVS 2205 code of practice and the design of the failed tank, Engineering Failure Analysis, 6, 215-232 (1999) External links *Oil Storage Regulations *EPA *South Australia Department of Environment and Heritage Category:Dams Category:Safety Category:Flood control ","title":"Bunding"},{"id":"3755955","text":"The DX-10 was an entry-level Fujifilm digital camera featuring an 810,000 pixel sensor (1024x768 or 640x480 image size) and a fixed-focus lens.

It calls for political and social revolution in favor of workers' rights, the nationalization of key industries, Jewish‚ÄìArab coexistence, and gender equality. Name The name \\"Da'am\\" originates from Arabic and is a reverse acronym for the name Organization for Democratic Action (, muna·∫ì·∫ìamƒÅt al- øamal ad-dƒ´muqrƒÅ·π≠iyy). The name also means \\"support\\" in Arabic. History The party was founded in Haifa in 1995 as a result of splitting process in the communist camp of Israel; in 1960 Matzpen was founded by former members of the Israeli Communist Party and in the 1970s former members of Matzpen founded three organisations, one of them was The Workers Alliance-Avangard, then in 1977 former members of Avangard founded Derech HaNitzoz. Former members of Derech HaNitzoz established Da'am in 1995. In the 1999 elections the party won only 2,151 votes (0.06%), well below the electoral threshold of 1.5%. The 2003 elections saw a fall in support to just 1,925 votes, though its percentage (0.06%) remained roughly the same due to a reduced turnout. Nevertheless, it still did not pass the threshold. In the 2006 elections the party more than doubled its support, winning 3,692 votes (0.11%). However, with the raising of the threshold to 2%, it was even further away from obtaining even a single seat in the Knesset. In the 2009 elections it again failed to pass the threshold and did not receive any seats. In the 2013 elections it received 3,374 votes (0.09%) and again did not obtain a seat in the Knesset. The party did not contest the 2015 elections. In the 2019 elections the party campaigned with the slogan \\"Green Economy ‚Äî One Country\\", after it decided to support a one- state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict based on civic nationalism instead of a Palestinian state and to emphasize its support for eco-socialism. Ideology The party is a joint Arab‚ÄìJewish party emphasizing class identity over ethnic or national ones. It is strongly left-wing, supports workers' rights (particularly those of Israeli Arabs), disapproves of discrimination, and has an internationalist worldview. The party had supported the right of the Palestinian people to found an independent state based on the 1967 borders until 2018, after which the party supported a one-state solution based on civic nationalism. The party is against Israeli unilateralism and occupation of the Palestinian territories. It also opposes political Islam. Members of the party were involved in the establishment of the Workers Advice Center, \\"an initiative for building an independent labor association\\". Ma'an offers support to unemployed and unorganised (non-Union) workers. In the 2015 Israeli legislative election, it was the only political party in Israel headed by an Israeli Arab woman, Asma Agbarieh. The party produces the monthly English- language magazine Challenge,http://www.challenge-mag.com/ as well as the Arabic al Sabarhttp://www.alsabar-mag.com/ and the Hebrew quarterly Etgar.

Benjamin Confederate Memorial at Gamble Plantation Historic State Park, also known as the Gamble Mansion or Gamble Plantation, is a Florida State Park, located in Ellenton, Florida, on 37th Avenue East and US 301. It is home to the Florida Division United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). The park consists of the antebellum mansion developed by its first owner, Major Robert Gamble; a 40,000-gallon cistern to provide the household with fresh water; and of the former sugarcane plantation. At its peak, the forced-labor farm included 3,500 acres, and Gamble likely enslaved more than 200 people to work the property and process the sugarcane. The mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Robert Gamble House on August 12, 1970. Its columns and two-foot-thick walls are constructed of tabby, a regional material developed as a substitute for brick. The park also includes the restored wood-frame, two-story, Victorian-style Patten House, built in 1872 for owner George Patten. In 1925, the mansion and grounds were purchased by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and donated to the state as a memorial to Judah P. Benjamin, who served in three Cabinet positions under Confederate President Jefferson Davis during the American Civil War. He stayed at the plantation in May 1865, before fleeing from the Union forces and sailing to England, where he had a second career. The Gamble Mansion serves as home to the Florida Division UDC. In 1937, the UDC installed a memorial plaque to Benjamin at the mansion. Also on the grounds is the Confederate Veterans Memorial Monument, erected October 10, 1937.Confederate Monument Florida Public Archaeology Network In 2002, the State of Florida acquired the property that holds the ruins of the plantation's sugar mill, one of the South's largest, and added it to the historic park complex. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the Gamble Mansion on its list, Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places.Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places History The coastal area was inhabited for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, who left huge shell middens as evidence of their reliance on seafood. Historic tribes in this area included the Tocobaga, Creek, Yamasee, and Seminole. (The Creek and Seminole were relative latecomers, after their lands farther north were taken by white settlers.) At the close of the Seminole War in 1842, the United States opened the Florida frontier to settlement by European Americans. Major Robert Gamble Jr. (b. 1813 in Virginia), who had served in the war, received 160 acres for homesteading, and arrived at the Manatee River site in 1844.Thomas Tryon, \\"A new chapter in the history of Gamble Mansion\\", Herald Tribune, 10 January 2010, accessed 24 July 2011 Other sugar planters from South Carolina and established slave states soon joined him along the rich Manatee River valley on the western coast of today's central Florida. The sugar planters enslaved many people to clear the lands; plant, harvest and process sugarcane; and build the plantation houses, mills, and outbuildings. By 1845 a dozen plantations along the riverfront were producing for the New Orleans market. The planters shipped their commodity crops downriver and across the Gulf of Mexico to the international port. The Gamble Mansion was built principally by enslaved people, both laborers and artisans, using local materials over the course of five to six years. The mansion is an outstanding example of antebellum construction in the Doric Revivalist vernacular architectural style. The mansion's columns and two-foot-thick walls are made of tabby, a unique type of concrete first used by Spanish and English settlers on the Atlantic coast and Sea Islands as an alternative to clay bricks, which could not be produced due to a lack of clay in the coastal soil. Techniques for making tabby were brought to Florida by European-American planters and the African-American people they enslaved. The workers created the material by mixing lime (extracted by burning crushed oyster shells), more crushed oyster shells, sand, and water. The mixture was poured into molds for hardening, and the finished product was used in the same manner as bricks. Ample supplies of oyster shells were found in middens present on the sites of former Native American coastal villages. Covered cistern, Gamble Plantation Next to the house is a covered, 40,000-gallon cistern with a wood-shake roof, which Gamble had built to supply the household's fresh water needs. Fish were kept in the cistern to eat insects and help keep the water clean. Gamble lived in the mansion and used it as the headquarters of his extensive sugar plantation. By 1850, he had hired an overseer, 30-year-old David Lanner from Georgia. That year on the US Census, Gamble declared his real estate to be worth $19,000.\\"1850 United States Federal Census Record for Robert Gamble\\", Ancestry.com, accessed 24 July 2011 He enslaved a total of 62 people.\\"1850 U.S. Federal Census - Slave Schedules Record for Robert Gamble\\", Ancestry.com, accessed 24 July 2011 From starting with 160 acres, he rapidly acquired 3,500 acres. In addition to the mansion, he directed the construction of numerous outbuildings and slave quarters (also constructed of tabby), and the wharf from which sugar and molasses were shipped by schooner and steamboat. Likely more than 200 slaves lived and worked at the plantation at its productive peak. However, due to a declining sugar market and debts, Gamble had to sell the property in 1856. The Gamble Mansion is the only surviving plantation house in peninsular Florida. During the Civil War, the mansion was occupied by Captain Archibald McNeill, a famous Confederate blockade runner. Judah P. Benjamin, Confederate Secretary of State, took refuge here during May 1865 while making his escape from Federal troops following defeat of the Confederacy. He had been accused of having arranged for U.S. President Lincoln's assassination in April 1865 and feared being unable to get a fair trial after the war. McNeill aided Benjamin in escaping to the Bahamas. From there, Judah Benjamin sailed to England, arriving with almost no resources. He went on to establish a distinguished second legal career in London, where in 1872 he was selected as Queen's Counsel. The Gamble sugar mill, one of the antebellum era's largest, was destroyed by Union raiders in 1864. The brick ruins are located one-half mile to the north on State Road 683. The State of Florida acquired the mill property in 2002; it has cleared overgrown vegetation at the site to make the mill ruins visible, while protecting them with a fence.Judah P. Benjamin Confederate Memorial at Gamble Plantation Historic State Park, Official Website, accessed 23 July 2011 Patten House, built 1872 (photo, 2010) In 1895, the postbellum owner, George Patten's youngest son Dudley Patten, built a wooden, two-story vernacular Victorian style house for his young family. (Patten's wife, Ada Melville Turner Patten is said to have demanded a modern home after the couple who were married in 1891, had been living for several years in the old mansion with Patten's widowed mother.) The state has restored the Patten House, which is also part of the plantation park complex. But, in 2014, termite and water damage proved to cause concern for visitor's safety, so the house was closed to the public. Talk of demolition caused community members to stand for renovation, which was approved and begun in 2016. By December 2017, the contractors realized damage was more extensive than once believed, and asked the State of Florida for more money. The decision was made, once more, to demolish the home. Fortunately, the community outcry once more appears to have saved the home from this permanent solution to a temporary problem. The Patten House was nominated and has been selected as one of Florida's 11 to Save for 2018 by the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation. The announcement was made on May 17, 2018. The 11 to Save program is designed to increase the public's awareness of the urgent need to save Florida's historic resources, and to empower local preservationists and preservation groups in their efforts to preserve Florida's history. Tabby is a less permanent construction material than brick; and by 1902, the house and columns were deteriorating badly. In 1923 the Judah P. Benjamin Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) began to raise money to rescue the home from destruction. By 1925 they had bought the house and 16 acres; they donated the property to the state for preservation as a memorial to Judah Benjamin. The state completed restoration of the house in 1927. The UDC arranged in 1937 for the installation of a memorial plaque to honor the service of Judah Philip Benjamin to the Confederacy. He served as Attorney General, Secretary of War, and Secretary of State to President Jefferson Davis. Today, the mansion is furnished in the style of a successful mid-19th century plantation home. In January 2010, Janet Snyder Matthews, an historian at the University of Florida and the former associate director of the National Park Service, led a working seminar at the plantation. Her goal was for students to develop scholarly documentation on the plantation and its occupants, with a goal of upgrading the plantation's historic designation to reflect its significance, perhaps to that of a National Historic Landmark. Recreational activities The park is open from 8 a.m. to sundown, 365 days per year, and guided tours of Gamble Mansion are available.

Career=Career before politics After attending the public primary school Outercourt in The Hague, Kappeyne was home schooled by his father, who was rector of the gymnasium of The Hague and taught Greek, as secondary education. Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer, a prominent Protestant- Christian politician, became his guardian after the death of his father in 1840. In that year he began to study Roman and contemporary law at Leiden University. In 1845 he became lawyer in The Hague. In 1860 Kappeyne was elected to the city council of the city, as a liberal. Political career In 1862 Kappeyne was elected to the Dutch House of Representatives as a liberal for The Hague. He was elected on a 'Puttian' ticket. Fransen van de Putte, who was a minister at the time, wanted to steer a more conservative colonial course. In the 1866 elections he was defeated by the conservative Fran√ßois de Casembroot. In 1871 he was elected to the House of Representatives as a liberal for Haarlem, defeating the conservative Willem van Golstein. In the 1875 elections he defeat the conservative M.J. van Lennep. He became the leader of the liberals in 1876. In parliament he was known for his comical amendments. In 1877 Kappeneye was formateur of a liberal cabinet. Kappeyne became Ministers of the Interior and gave up his seat in parliament. He was appointed chairperson of the council of ministers, an office equivalent to today's Prime Minister of the Netherlands, formally temporarily, but he was the political leader of the cabinet. As minister he enacted important laws, such as a new law on primary education. This law put higher demands on the quality of school buildings and the wages and education of teachers. This raised the financial burdens of primary schools, but only public schools received state subsidies. This effectively eliminated religious schools which, without subsidies, were unable to sustain the financial burdens. This led to staunch opposition as part of the school struggle from Anti-Revolutionary and Catholic members of parliament, and a citizens' petition. Kappeyene however did not change his mind. On 10 June 1879 the law on the channels which he proposed was rejected by parliament. Kappeyne asked the King to dismiss him, but William III refused. On 2 July, Kappeyne asked the King to allow a constitutional revision, William III refused, and Kappeyne asked the King to dismiss him again, and William III finally dismissed Kappeyne. Behind the fall of the Kappeyne cabinet lay a conflict between the factions of the progressive liberals and the more moderate liberals. Career after politics In 1879, Kappeyne returned to his lawyer's office in The Hague. He unsuccessfully attempted to regain a seat in parliament in the 1880, 1883 and 1884 elections. In 1880 he was defeated in the district of Amsterdam by the liberal Johan George Gleichman, in 1883 in Amsterdam by the liberal conservative Adriaan Gildemeester, and in 1884 by the liberal Jacob Duyvis. He remained lawyer until his death in 1895. In this period he refused a request by Leiden University to become honorary professor of law. In 1888 Kappeyne was elected into the Senate as a liberal for North Holland. In the Senate, Kappeyne took a more conservative course as he had previously done and remained a backbencher.

Synonyms include 46,XX testicular difference of sex development (46,XX DSD), 46,XX sex reversal, nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD, and XX sex reversal.updated 2015 In 90 percent of these individuals, the syndrome is caused by the Y chromosome's SRY gene, which triggers male reproductive development, being atypically included in the crossing over of genetic information that takes place between the pseudoautosomal regions of the X and Y chromosomes during meiosis in the father. When the X with the SRY gene combines with a normal X from the mother during fertilization, the result is an XX male. Less common are SRY-negative XX males, which can be caused by a mutation in an autosomal or X chromosomal gene. The masculinization of XX males is variable. This syndrome is diagnosed through various detection methods and occurs in approximately 1:20,000 newborn males, making it much less common than Klinefelter syndrome. Treatment is medically unnecessary, although some individuals choose to undergo treatments to make them appear more male or female. Signs and symptoms The appearance of XX males can fall into one of three categories: 1) males that have normal internal and external genitalia, 2) males with external ambiguities, and 3) males that have both internal and external genital ambiguities (also known as true hermaphrodites). External genital ambiguities can include hypospadias, micropenis, and clitoromegaly. Typically, the appearance of XX males differs from that of an XY male in that they are smaller in height and weight. Most XX males have small testes, are sterile, and have an increase in maldescended testicles compared to XY males. Some XX male individuals have decreased amounts of body hair and decreased libido. Individuals with this condition sometimes have feminine characteristics, with varying degrees of gynecomastia but with no intra-abdominal M√ºllerian tissue. According to research at the University of Oklahoma health science centers, despite XX males exhibiting feminine characteristics, their behaviours are usually representative of masculinity in their culture. They generally have small testes and may also have abnormalities such as undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias). A small number of affected people have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia). Affected children are typically raised as males and are likely to have a male gender identity.  Masculinization  Schematic of sexual differentiation in humans. The degree to which individuals with XX male syndrome develop the male phenotype is variable, even among SRY-positive individuals. A completely male phenotype usually develops in the presence of the SRY gene but, in some cases, the presence of the SRY gene can result in internal and/or external genitalia ambiguities. Normal XX females undergo X inactivation during which one copy of the X chromosome is silenced. It is thought that X inactivation in XX males may account for the genital ambiguities and incomplete masculinization seen in SRY-positive XX males. The X chromosome with the SRY gene is preferentially chosen to be the active X chromosome 90% of the time, which explains complete male phenotype being observed often in SRY-positive XX males. In the remaining 10%, X inactivation spreads to include a portion of the SRY gene, resulting in incomplete masculinization. Masculinization of SRY-negative XX males is dependent upon which genes have mutations and at what point in development these mutations occur. Genetics SRY Protein Males typically have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each diploid cell of their bodies. Females typically have two X chromosomes. XX males that are SRY-positive have two X chromosomes, with one of them containing genetic material from the Y chromosome, making them phenotypically male but genetically female. In about 80 percent of individuals with 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development, the condition results from an abnormal exchange of genetic material between chromosomes (translocation). This exchange occurs as a random event during the formation of sperm cells in the affected person's father. The translocation causes the SRY gene to be misplaced, almost always onto an X chromosome. If a fetus is conceived from a sperm cell with an X chromosome bearing the SRY gene, it will develop as a male despite not having a Y chromosome. This form of the condition is called SRY-positive 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development. About 20 percent of those with 46 XX testicular disorder of sex development do not have the SRY gene. This form of the condition is called SRY-negative 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is often unknown, although changes affecting other genes have been identified. Individuals with SRY-negative 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development are more likely to have ambiguous genitalia than are people with the SRY-positive form.  SRY-positive  An example of translocation between two chromosomes. The SRY gene plays an important role in sex determination by initiating testicular development. In most XX males the SRY gene is present. The tip of the Y chromosome contains the SRY gene and, during recombination, a translocation occurs in which the SRY gene on the Y chromosome is moved to become part of an X chromosome. The presence of the translocated SRY gene leads to an XX embryo developing male characteristics.  SRY-negative  In 10% of cases, an XX male does not have the SRY gene, causing variations in their levels of masculinity. The exact cause of this condition is unknown but it has been proposed that mutations in the SOX9 gene may contribute to this syndrome since SOX9 plays a role in testes differentiation during development. Another proposed cause is mutations to the DAX1 gene which encodes a nuclear hormone receptor. DAX1 represses masculinizing genes, therefore, if there is a loss of function of DAX1 then testes can develop in an XX individual. Mutations in SF1 and WNT4 genes are also being studied in connection with SRY-negative XX male syndrome.  Xg gene  Hypothesis that XX occurs in males because of the interaction of the testis-determining portion of the Y chromosome and part of the X chromosome, called the Xg gene, is generally supported by various data. The frequency of the Xg phenotype in XX males is closer to normal males' frequency than normal females' frequency. There have been at least four cases where XX males have inherited the Xg allele from their father, and at least nine cases where XX males did not inherit the allele from their father.  Diagnosis  In cases where the individual is being evaluated for ambiguous genitalia, such as a small phallus, hypospadias, or labioscrotal folds, exploratory surgery may be used to determine if male and/or female internal genitalia is present. A standard karyotype can be completed to cytogenetically determine that an individual with a partial or complete male phenotype has a XX genotype. FISH analysis determines the presence or absence of the SRY gene. Localization of the SRY gene can by determined using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Indicators include two testes which have not descended the inguinal canal, although this is seen in a minority of XX males, and the absence of M√ºllerian tissue. External indicators include decreased body weight and small testes. Treatment XX males are sterile due to no sperm content and there is currently no treatment to address this infertility. Genital ambiguities, while not necessary to treat for medical reasons, can be treated through the use of hormonal therapy, surgery, or both. Since XX male syndrome is variable in its presentation, the specifics of treatment varies widely as well. In some cases gonadal surgery can be performed to remove partial or whole female genitalia. This may be followed by plastic and reconstructive surgery to make the individual appear more externally male. Conversely, the individual may wish to become more feminine and feminizing genitoplasty can be performed to make the ambiguous genitalia appear more female. Hormonal therapy may also aid in making an individual appear more male or female. Testosterone Testosterone At puberty, most affected individuals require treatment with the male sex hormone testosterone to induce development of male secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and deepening of the voice (masculinization). Hormone treatment can also help prevent breast enlargement (gynecomastia). Adults with this disorder are usually shorter than average for males and are unable to have children (infertile). Epidemiology As of 2010, only 200 cases have been reported ‚Äî it is estimated that 1 of every 20,000 to 30,000 males has a 46,XX karyotype.

A decisive victory would result in the opponent being 'beaten down' to a lower rank. A player would be beaten down if he fell behind his opponent by four wins in the net score. This would mean a change in the playing terms corresponding to a handicap suitable for a rank difference of one rank. Some notable historical J≈´bango players are Go Seigen (1914-2014), Kitani Minoru (1909‚Äì75), Honinbo Shuei (1852-1907) and Hashimoto Utaro (1907-94). These matches were usually spread over long time- periods, with gaps of months possible between games. They were also peripatetic (taking place in different venues). Both of these features make them different from modern mind sports matches, which tend to be held over a short time in a definite location. Modern go title matches have adapted these characteristics of a j≈´bango. Traditional format Among other formal matches, the j≈´bango was a traditional form of contest in the Edo period, where players would undertake such a match against a close rival, with the goal of determining which player was stronger. In that era, top rankings were hard to achieve. The normal starting conditions would be those corresponding to the players being of equal rank, or tagaisen. This means they should alternate with Black and White, this being before the era of komigo. Not all matches were played on tagaisen terms. If agreed, there was the possibility of playing at a handicap, e.g. Black two games out of three, if one player went far enough ahead. This could be reinforced to one player always taking Black, a handicap equivalent to two professional ranks, in extreme cases. For details see professional go handicaps. An uchikomi j≈´bango was one in which 'beating down' applied. Modern j≈´bango These conventions were revived and made more precise by a series of high-profile matches in the twentieth century, sponsored by the Yomiuri Shimbun. Between about 1930 and 1960, j≈´bango included many of the most important games, judged by prestige, in Japanese professional go. After 1960 the annual title matches sponsored by newspapers took over, in the public interest. The era of j≈´bango was dominated by Go Seigen, who had an outstanding record in these games against his peers. After a break of 10 years, a j≈´bango was held in 2014 from 26 January - 28 September between and , two of the world's leading players. The format of the match was first to 6 wins. The match lasted for eight games and was won by Lee Sedol with 6 wins, 2 losses and no draws. The prize money was ¬•5,000,000 (~800,000 USD). Games 1-3 and 5-8 were held in different cities in China.

Descent and the inheritance of property was traced through females. It was followed by all Nair castes, some of the Ambalavasis, Mappilas, and tribal groups. The elder male was considered the head known as karanavar and the entire assets of the family were controlled by him as if he was the sole owner. The properties were not handed to his sons but to the daughters of his sons or to their sisters. The word literally means inheritance by sisters' children, as opposed to sons and daughters. 'Marumakkal', in the Malayalam language, means nephews and nieces. The joint family under the matrilineal system is known as Tharavad and formed the nucleus of the society in Malabar. The customary law of inheritance was codified by the Madras Marumakkathayam Act 1932, Madras Act No. 22 of 1933, published in the Fort St. George Gazette on 1 August 1933. Malabar was part of the Madras Presidency in British India. In the Madras Marumakkathayam Act 1932, 'Marumakkathayam' is defined as the system of inheritance in which descent is traced by females, and 'Marumakkathayee' means a person governed by the Marumakkathayam law of inheritance. The system of inheritance is now abolished by The Joint Family System (Abolition) Act, 1975, by the Kerala State Legislature. Modern changes and adaptations By the beginning of the 20th century, marumakkattayam was increasingly seen as an undesirable remnant of a feudal past, and discontented groups including Nair men sought to bring reform. The reforms were pushed through in spite of opposition from conservative factions led by Kesava Pillai of Kandamath in the Travancore Court, Sree Mulam State Council and by leading members of society such as C. V. Raman Pillai.Page 35-39 Kandamathu Kudumba Sangamam Published by K. K. N., Neyyattinkara, S. India 1995Jeffrey in the Decline of Nayar Dominance in Travancore, See notes under C V Raman Pillai In the states of Kochi and Tiruvitankoor, and the British Indian province of Malabar, which later joined together to form Kerala in 1957. The notion of the husband as the wife's guardian, which became prevalent after these changes, undid the very concept of marumakkattayam. However, the system continues to hold sway over Keralite culture and social personalities, and the tharavadu remains the focus of the emotional make-up of many Nairs. Even today, in most families, children carry their mother's last name, and not that of their father.

Devore is completely within the city's 92407 ZIP Code and is within the 909 area code as well. Devore is served by the San Bernardino City Unified School District. Devore is home to Kimbark Elementary, a 2016 California Gold Ribbon School. While no middle or high schools are located within the neighborhood, the nearby neighborhoods of Verdemont and University Hills have a middle school and high school, respectively. Kimbark School opened in 1968. It was preceded by Cajon School just south of Devore Road on Cajon Blvd. Cajon School, one large room that could be divided into two by a sliding wall, was built in 1924 of native rocks by residents of Devore on land donated by R. B. Peters, one of the community's most illustrious residents. A four room wing was added in 1949 to accommodate students through sixth grade. That Cajon School was preceded by an earlier one on the other side of Cajon Blvd. which functioned from 1870 to 1921, when the Cajon School District was annexed by San Bernardino. Local Attractions Glen Helen Amphitheater also known as Glen Helen Pavilion, is a local open-air concert hall that hosts to many music festivals. Mountain High is a resort in Wrightwood that is open in the Winter for snow sports (skiing and snowboarding). The Old Fire Devore suffered from a fire on October 25, 2003. The fire began at Waterman Canyon around 9:00 A.M and by 6:30 P.M the fire had grown up to 10,000 acres. The fire burned 91,281 acres, destroyed 940 residences, 30 commercial buildings and 300 outbuildings. More than 4,000 firefighters were called in effort to put this fire out. The Old Fire grew and spread towards the San Bernardino Mountains. The Old Fire grew so big that it merged with another existing fire, the Grand Prix Fire, across the Interstate 15 Freeway. Combined, these fires caused damage that spanned more than 30 miles wide. When this fire hit Devore, the city was still recovering from the Panorama Fire from November 1980 which had damaged 23,800 acres. The destruction caused by The Old Fire further damaged the land from a previous fire, The 1980 Panorama Fire that burned 23,800 acres. The Old Fire resulted in 6 deaths and evacuation of over 70,000 citizens.

The carrot piece on top belongs to the broth, which is used as gravy for the complements. Rouladen or Rinderrouladen is a German meat dish, usually consisting of bacon, onions, mustard and pickles wrapped in thinly sliced beef which is then cooked.\\"Rinderroulade.\\" TheFreeDictionary.com. 2014. Farlex, Inc. 31 Dec. 2014 The dish is considered traditional also in the Upper Silesia region of Poland where it is known as rolada ≈õlƒÖska (Silesian roulade) and in the Czech Republic where it is known as ≈°panƒõlsk√Ω pt√°ƒçek (spanish bird). Beef or veal is typically used, though some food scholars tend to believe that the original version was probably venison or pork, and pork is still popular in some areas. The beef rouladen as we know them today have become popular over the last century. The cut is usually topside beef or silverside since this is the cheaper cut. The meat is cut into large, thin slices. The filling is a mixture of smoked and cooked pork belly, chopped onions and chopped pickles (gherkins) which is at times varied by adding minced meat or sausage meat. The mixture varies from region to region. Rouladen are traditionally served for dinner. Red wine is often used for the gravy. Serving Rouladen are usually served with either potato dumplings or mashed potatoes and pickled red cabbage. Roasted winter vegetables are another common side dish. The gravy is an absolute requirement to round off the dish and is usually poured over the meat. Sp√§tzle are a good complement to the dish since they soak up the gravy well. Originally considered as a dish for common people, it is today enjoyed by many as a festive dish.

Early life Taylor was born in 1901 in Newcastle, New South Wales. Brought up in an Anglican family, Taylor initially wanted to join the church, but obtained a job as a public servant while waiting to study to be a priest, and was eventually employed in the office of the Solicitor-General of Australia, where he developed an interest in law. Taylor studied at Fort Street Boys' High School and the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree, with honours, in 1926. Later that year, Taylor was admitted to the New South Wales Bar. In 1933, he married Ceinwen Williams, with whom he would later have a son and a daughter. Career as a lawyer From 1933 to 1938, was a Challis Lecturer in the law school at the University of Sydney, teaching equity and company law. He was made a King's Counsel in 1943, and began to have an increasing number of appearances before the High Court. From 1947 to 1948, Taylor represented the banks in the famous Bank Nationalisation case, as part of a team led by future Chief Justice of Australia Garfield Barwick, also including future High Court colleague Frank Kitto. From 1948 to 1949, Taylor was President of the New South Wales Bar Association. Judicial career Taylor was made a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1952, and later that year, on 3 September, he was appointed to the bench of the High Court. He was appointed following the retirement of John Latham and the elevation of Owen Dixon as Chief Justice earlier in the year. According to David Marr, Taylor was never as close to Dixon as some of the other justices, such as Kitto or Fullagar, and had a blunter judicial style than Dixon. Dixon was succeeded in 1964 by Garfield Barwick. Taylor had worked with him on a number of cases, including the Banks case, and they shared some common views on Australian constitutional law, as well as having a similar judicial style. Although Taylor worked better with Barwick than with Dixon, all of his colleagues agreed that he was a hard- working and congenial judge. Taylor was made a Knight of the Order of the British Empire in 1955, and was appointed to the Privy Council in 1963. At the invitation of the Lord Chancellor, Baron Gardiner, Taylor spent three months in 1967 in London hearing Privy Council appeals. In May 1968, Taylor suffered a heart attack, but after a short break he returned to full duties on the High Court. Barwick later said that although the heart attack certainly affected Taylor physically, he was just as dedicated to his work as he had previously been. Taylor continued to serve on the High Court until his death in August 1969, when he died suddenly one Sunday morning. In a tribute published in the Commonwealth Law Reports, Barwick said of Taylor that he was: > \\"...wise in conference, confident and practical in decision and gentle in > dissent... [what] is uppermost in our minds is the warmth of his friendship, > his unfailing good humour, and his ready turn of wit and phrase on all > occasions, making our daily association with him pleasant and memorable... > The Court has lost a great judge, each of us here has lost a close friend.\\" References Category:1901 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Justices of the High Court of Australia Category:Judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales Category:Australian members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Australian Queen's Counsel Category:20th-century Australian lawyers Category:People educated at Fort Street High School ","title":"Alan Taylor (Australian judge)"},{"id":"3756114","text":"Clint Gosling (born 1 May 1960) is a former association football goalkeeper who represented New Zealand at international level.

An extension of the trail from Bethesda to Silver Spring, along a route formerly known as the Georgetown Branch Trail is currently being constructed as part of the Purple Line light rail project. The Capital Crescent Trail is one of the most heavily used rail trails in the United States and is used by more than 1 million walkers, joggers, bikers, skateboarders and rollerbladers each year. In 2005, it was named one of the \\"21 great places that show how transportation can enliven a community\\" by The Project for Public Spaces.PPS.org History The trail runs on the abandoned right-of-way of the Georgetown Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The branch was partially built in 1892 and completed in 1910. It served Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO), the Washington Mill, and federal government buildings; but with the changing use of Georgetown's waterfront, became obsolete. B&O; was purchased by the Chessie System in 1973. In 1983 the railroad notified the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) that the Georgetown Branch that it would be the subject of an abandonment application. Within a year, the Washington Area Bicyclist Association contacted the Maryland National Capital Parks and Planning Commission about turning it into a trail. In January 1986, WABA completed a feasibility study of the trail, and the next month advocates chose the name \\"Capital Crescent Trail.\\" Because of structural problems with a bridge in Montgomery County, the last train on the line ran in June, 1985. At that time, the only customers were the General Services Administration (GSA) heating plant at 29th and K streets and a small building supply company in Bethesda. Three months later, Chessie indicated that they would ask the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for permission to abandon the line. Chessie claimed they were losing money on the line and that it detracted from the scenery around the Washington Harbor Condominiums, of which Chessie was a part owner. Local governments and the National Park Service began trying to acquire the land for a trail and transit corridor as early as 1985, when the Interstate Commerce Commission informed them that the National Trails System Act of 1968 could not be used to force Chessie to turn the land over. Problems with the line were exacerbated after the Potomac River flood in November undermined about 75 feet of roadbed near Fletcher's Boathouse. Before the abandonment, Chessie made plans to sell the section in the Palisades to a developer, and offered to sell it for $15 million. Chessie, by then part of the CSX Corporation, asked for permission to abandon the line in April 1986. The abandonment was completed in April 1988 and most of the track removed by the mid 1990s. Advocates for turning the railroad into a trail, including the Greater Bethesda-Chevy Chase Coalition and the newly formed Coalition for the Capital Crescent Trail began to lobby local and federal officials to do so, putting together a Concept Plan in 1988. Despite opposition from neighbors and those who wanted the right-of-way for mass transit, an excursion train or other development, they were able to convince the Montgomery County Government, along with a coalition of developers and government agencies, to purchase the right-of-way from the D.C. line to Silver Spring. Montgomery County purchased the right-of-way on December 16, 1988, four days after the ICC approved the purchase and transfer, under the Trails System Act. CSX sold the Maryland section of the line for $10.5 million. The following year, the County voted to build a trolley and bike trail along the Bethesda-Silver Spring section of the right-of-way. In December 1988, Kingdon Gould, Jr., purchased an option to buy the railroad right-of-way after failing to buy it outright for the purpose of restarting the railroad. However, once Montgomery County made a deal to buy their section of the trail, Gould placed the section in the District of Columbia, between Georgetown and the D.C./Maryland boundary, into a trust until the National Park Service could purchase it outright for $10.5 million in 1990. The DC section then became a component of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. In 1991, advocates John Dugger and Henri Bartholomot helped secure federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act funding to develop the Maryland portion of the trail. The funding also paid for the DC portion and the rehabilitation of the Arizona Avenue Trestle. With the right-of-way and funding secured, work on the trail began in the early 1990s with four separate sections. Before any of the formal work began, volunteers built a wooden deck over the Arizona Avenue Railroad Bridge in 1990. The groundbreaking for the trail was held on September 30, 1992, when Montgomery County leaders symbolically pried loose one of the railroad ties. Work then began on the first section between Bethesda Avenue and Little Falls Parkway. That section, paid for by Montgomery County departments of transportation and parks, and businessmen John Ourisman and Tom Miller, was cleared by PEPCO in exchange for easement considerations elsewhere and to reimburse the community after residents complained about power-line work on nearby Arlington Road. It was the first section to open when the ribbon was cut on March 30, 1994. Work on the portion in the District, from Dalecarlia Reservoir to Georgetown, except for the Arizona Avenue Trestle, started in 1993, finished in late 1994 and was performed by the National Park Service. That same year, Montgomery County, with financial assistance from Maryland and the federal government and planning from the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, built the section from Little Falls Parkway to MacArthur Boulevard. Removal of the tracks was done in the spring, paving in the summer and the section was completed by the end of the year. In late 1994/early 1995, Arlington County built the section of the trail near Dalecarlia Reservoir from MacArthur to the District line, because they were doing unrelated work on pipelines in the area. In late 1995, the concrete deck of the Arizona Avenue trestle was poured, replacing the wooden deck built 5 years earlier. In June 1996 the Arizona Avenue Trestle was opened and in November the trail bridge over River Road followed. The last piece of the trail to be completed, the Dalecarlia Bridge includes a component of a bridge which formerly took the Georgetown Branch over the Washington and Great Falls Electric Railway and it was designed to go over a road connecting two parts of the Washington Aqueduct reservation. Although most track removal was completed a few years earlier, the first three miles of the line from Silver Spring to Bethesda remained tracked until 1996, the rails not being removed until the summer of that year and in December of that year, dedication ceremonies formally opened the River Road Bridge, the Dalecarlia Bridge and the full Capital Crescent trail. An unpaved trail connection to Norton Street, NW and a staircase connection to Potomac Avenue, NW were built after 1997 and before 2003. A plaza along River Road, named for Neal Potter, was opened on November 3, 2018. The plaza was first envisioned by architecture students at The Catholic University of America in 2006 and 2007. Their professor, Iris Miller, called the plaza, which features benches, stone sitting walls, a curving pathway, a red metal pergola, bike racks, a repair station, a display with trail information, and a plaque to honor Potter, \\"a tribute to persistence.\\" A second, 1,300-square-foot public plaza near Bethesda and Woodmont avenues, Ourisman Plaza, was constructed in 2019 as part of an agreement with an adjacent car dealership that had built a garage that encroached on the trail. As part of the deal, they also agreed to move their driveway farther from the trail's Bethesda Avenue entrance, to install decorative screening around the expanded garage to create a more appealing facade facing the trail, and to widen about a quarter-mile section of the trail about two feet to 16 feet. The section from Bethesda to Silver Spring, meanwhile, was delayed due to continued debate over the proposed trolley. It later opened as the Georgetown Branch Interim Trail. That section will be constructed as part of the ongoing work on the Purple Line. Georgetown Branch Interim Trail  The section of the right-of-way from Bethesda to Silver Spring opened later than the section from Bethesda to Georgetown did, primarily because of a debate over what to do with it and a series of lawsuits. A year after the right-of-way was purchased, Gov. William Donald Schaefer (D) offered $70 million to build a trolley line on it and later a combined transit/trail corridor was added to the county's master plan. This led to several contentious battles between those who supported transit and those who did not, with those who supported a trail left in the middle. There were also lawsuits over the ownership of the line with adjacent homeowners, the Chevy Chase Land Co. and Columbia Country Club all suing the county. The county won all the suits and pursued construction of an interim trail while transit options were considered. On May 17, 1997, the Georgetown Branch Interim Trail, from the east side of the Air Rights Tunnel in Bethesda to Stewart Avenue in Silver Spring opened. On August 15, 1998, the Air Rights Tunnel in Bethesda (built in 1910) was opened to trail traffic, connecting the interim and permanent sections. In June 2000, Montgomery County committed $1.3 million to repair the Rock Creek Trestle, which had been damaged by arson and fire, most notably in 1967, and open it for trail use. The trestle was dedicated for trail use on May 31, 2003. Montgomery County began studying transit options for the corridor as early as 1986 and continued to study, litigate and debate it, until work began in 2017. A trolley between Bethesda and Silver Spring went through several iterations including the Georgetown Branch Light Rail Transit, the Inner Purple Line, the Bi-County Transitway and finally the Purple Line - a light rail train from Bethesda to New Carrollton, MD. Each iteration included plans to pave a parallel extension of the trail between Bethesda and Silver Spring and using the existing Air Rights Tunnel. However, in 2011 MTA announced that the cost of building the extended trail would be $103 million, much more than the previously estimated $65 million. Half of the cost would result from widening the Air Rights Tunnel to include the trail with the train. Instead, the county made plans for a 2nd trail tunnel, parallel to the transit tunnel, built, in part, under a new Air Rights building. The Palisades neighborhood of Washington, D.C., crosses the C&O; Canal and is now part of the Capital Crescent Trail. On September 5, 2017, the Georgetown Branch was officially closed so that work could begin on the Purple Line light rail. In conjunction with the Purple Line project, construction crews are extending the Capital Crescent Trail as a paved 12 foot wide off-road shared use path from Bethesda to Silver Spring. The Purple Line project, which was to be completed in 2022 when the trail was closed, has experienced many delays and as of 2019 was to be completed in 2023; but after a contract dispute led to the project managers walking off the job, the state took over and claimed it could delay completion for years. The trail could be opened before the trains run, but a tunnel through Bethesda will not be completed until 2026. Description The currently closed section of the trail started at Lyttonsville Junction, about one mile (1.6 km) west of downtown Silver Spring. It went west on an unpaved, crushed stone surface passing over Rock Creek on a trestle to Chevy Chase and then to Bethesda through the 800-foot-long Air Rights Tunnel. It was closed in September 2017 for construction of the Purple Line and the extension of the trail to Silver Spring. It will reopen around 2022 as a paved trail from Bethesda to Silver Spring. The currently paved portion of the trail begins in downtown Bethesda, where the trail begins to turn south. It follows the Little Falls Branch to the Potomac River and the District line. It goes over the River Road Bridge and past the site of Fort Sumner, a Civil War-era fort. It then moves through the Dalecarlia area, traveling under the Washington Aqueduct conduit at the Dalecarlia Tunnel, past the Dalecarlia Reservoir and through the grounds of the Dalecarlia Treatment Plant over the Dalecarlia Bridge. Crossing into Washington, DC, it then turns southeast, dropping down from the Palisades neighborhood over the C&O; Canal on the Arizona Avenue Railway Bridge, and down to the banks of the Potomac. It then runs between the Potomac and the C&O; Canal, past Fletcher's Boathouse and the Foundry Branch Tunnel, into Georgetown to its terminus at the west end of Water Street NW.

His ≈ìuvre, particularly abundant, was published primarily by publisher Fleuve Noir. He used a variety of pseudonyms, notably Maurice Lionel, Maurice d'Escrignelles, and Lionel Rex. Overview Maurice Limat published science fiction novels such as Les Fianc√©s de la Plan√®te Mars [The Fianc√©s of Planet Mars] (1936) and Les Naufrag√©s de la Voie Lact√©e [The Castaways of the Milky Way] (1939), with a style that was reminiscent of the type of science fiction published before or just after World War I. During that period, the prolific Limat also authored a number of adventure novels with fantasy elements such as La Montagne aux Vampires [The Mountain of Vampires] (1936), about a man who could control vampires, L'Araign√©e d'Argent [The Silver Spider] (1936), featuring a robotic spider created by an Ancient civilization, Le Septi√®me Cerveau [The Seventh Brain] (1939), Le Zodiaque de l'Himalaya [The Zodiac Of The Himalaya] (1942) and La Com√®te √âcarlate [The Scarlet Comet] (1948), to name but a few. During the 1950s, Limat wrote more science fiction novels, such as Les Faiseurs de Plan√®tes [The Planet Makers] (1951), Com√®te 73 [Comet 73] (1953), Courrier Interplan√©taire [Interplanetary Courrier] (1953) and Le Mal des √âtoiles [Star Sickness] (1954), disguising his abundant production with various pseudonyms. During 1955, he contributed SOS Galaxie [SOS Galaxy] to the imprint S√©rie 2000 and then wrote Monsieur Cosmos (1956) which dealt with the theme of the macrocosmic man, creator of universes. His novels began to display the influence of American \\"space operas\\". By the time he began writing for the Anticipation imprint of Editions Fleuve Noir, during 1959, Limat was already a veteran writer. Les Enfants du Chaos [The Children Of Chaos] (1959), in which men use psychic powers to create a world, but then ask themselves whether they have earned the right to play God, is somewhat characteristic of his subsequent production. Limat continued to be a prolific writer, authoring numerous, lyrical, sometimes even religious, space operas for Fleuve Noir‚Äî107 in total, until Atoxa-des-Abysses [Atoxa-Of-The-Abyss] (1987)‚Äîas well as some horror novels for Fleuve Noir's Angoisse imprint, which featured as main character a detective of the supernatural, Teddy Verano. Limat introduced the character of futuristic police commissioner Robin Muscat in Les Foudroyants [The Lightning Men] (No. 164; 1960), in which a hapless young man is turned into an electromagnetic force. His most popular, long-running hero was the green-eyed, telepathic Chevalier Coqdor introduced in L'√âtoile de Satan [The Star Of Satan] (No. 241; 1964). Muscat and Coqdor often teamed with each other and were featured, separately or together, in a great number of subsequent novels. The Chevalier Coqdor adventures usually celebrated the power of love and tolerance, and a genuine belief in God, the Great Architect of the Universe, something unusual in science fiction. New stories featuring Chevalier Coqdor are now written by Jean-Michel Archaimbault & Jean-Marc Lofficier.

The intrinsicoid deflection reflects the depolarization vector from the endocardium to the epicardium. In the presence of bundle branch block or ventricular hypertrophy, the depolarization impulse takes a longer than normal period of time to reach the recording electrode. This delays the onset of the intrinsicoid deflection. This prolongation or delay is an important criterion for diagnosing bundle branch block and ventricular hypertrophy.

M. Coetzee. The novel won the Booker Prize for 1983. The novel is a story of a man named Michael K, who makes an arduous journey from Cape Town to his mother's rural birthplace, amid a fictitious civil war during the apartheid era, in the 1970-80s. Plot summary The novel is split into three parts. The novel begins with Michael K, a poor man with a cleft lip who has spent his childhood in institutions and works as a gardener in Cape Town. Michael tends to his mother who works as a domestic servant to a wealthy family. The country descends into civil war and martial law is imposed, and Michael's mother becomes very sick. Michael decides to quit his job and escape the city to return his mother to her birthplace, which she says was Prince Albert. Michael finds himself unable to obtain the proper permits for travel out of the city so he builds a shoddy rickshaw to carry his mother, and they go on their way. Soon after escaping, Michael's mother dies in a hospital. He lingers for some time, carrying his mother's ashes around with him in a box. Finally, Michael decides to continue on his journey to Prince Albert to deliver his mother's ashes. Along the way, though, he is detained for not having the required travel papers, thus being assigned to work detail on a railway track. After his job on the railway track is finished, Michael makes his way to the farm his mother spoke of on Prince Albert. The farm is abandoned and desolate. Soon, Michael discovers how to live off the land. However, when one of the relatives of the real owners of the farm arrives, he treats Michael like a servant. Michael dislikes this treatment so he escapes up into the mountains. In the mountains, Michael goes through a period of starvation while he becomes aware of his surroundings. In his malnourished state he finds his way down to a town where he is picked up by the police and is sent to work on a work camp. Here, Michael meets a man named Robert. Robert explains that the workers in the camp are exploited for cheap labor by the townspeople. Eventually, there is an attack on Prince Albert and the workers of the camp are blamed. The local police captain takes over and Michael escapes. Michael finds his way back to the farm but soon feels claustrophobic within the house. Therefore, he builds a shelter in the open where he is able to watch his garden. Rebels come out of the mountains and use his garden. Although Michael is angered by this he stays in hiding. Michael becomes malnourished and delirious again because he has not come out of hiding. He is found by some soldiers and is taken to a rehabilitation camp in Cape Town. It is here that Michael is identified as \\"CM,\\" an abbreviation most likely signifying \\"colored male.\\" At the rehabilitation camp, a doctor becomes interested in Michael. He finds Michael's simple nature extremely fascinating and finds him to be unfairly accused of aiding rebels. Michael becomes very sick and delirious because he refuses to eat. The doctor tries to understand Michael's stubborn ways while attempting to get Michael released. However, Michael escapes on his own. Upon his escape, Michael meets with a group of nomadic people who feed him and introduce him to a woman who has sex with him. He returns to the apartment where he and his mother lived in Cape Town, the same apartment and city he had tried to escape some time ago. Michael reflects on the garden he made in Prince Albert. Some commentators notice a connection between the character Michael K and the protagonist Josef K. in The Trial by Franz Kafka. The book also bears many references to Kafka, and it is believed, \\"K\\" is a tribute to Kafka. Comparisons have also been drawn between the novel and Heinrich von Kleist's novella Michael Kohlhaas, based upon the protagonist's name and similarities of plot, though it is often suggested that Coetzee's work is an antithetical response. Major character analysis=Michael K (K) A simple man born in South Africa, K bears the deformity of a hare lip. K's central role is underscored by his appearance‚Äîhe is deformed and because of this, people look down upon him. His mother, the police, and Visagie's grandson all treat him with respect of a lesser human on the basis that he looks and acts slow. This is shown by the fact that K's mother institutionalizes him until she needs him, the police let him wander around unnoticed because he has a childish innocence, and Visagie's grandson treats him as a common servant. But K is also dedicated to being true to his beliefs. When K's mother becomes very ill, he dedicates his life to taking her home at whatever the cost. And when she dies along the way, K continues to show his dedication by carrying her ashes all the way to Prince Albert so she can finally be home. When K is institutionalized he becomes a gardener, where he learns to enjoy isolation and the freedom it grants him. We see K's isolation and freedom continue throughout the book, starting at the Visagie's house where he first begins to learn to live off the land. But when his freedom is encroached on, K flees even further from society, maintaining his freewill. In the mountains he understands how he wants to live his life, which involves only eating food he has grown from the Earth. K ultimately returns to Cape Town and to his mother's old apartment, never giving up his longing for freedom. Anna K Michael K's mother disliked him since she saw his disfigurement. Anna put K into a government institution and ignored him until she had no one else to turn to because of her health. Though she seems to have been uncaring and absent during his childhood, K shows his unconditional love for her by taking care of her until her death. Anna lived her life in fear: fear of losing her job, getting sick, or being put out on the street. The Medical Officer The infirmary medical officer at the rehabilitation camp is responsible for taking care of K when he is brought in. The medical officer was the only one of the staff at the hospital to realize K is an innocent civilian, being unfairly treated for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The medical officer becomes fascinated by K and his childish nature and his reasons for not eating. The medical officer originally thinks K wants to kill himself ‚Äî hence his reason for not eating ‚Äî but he comes to understand that K does want to live, just on his own terms. After K's escape, the medical officer realizes that because the camp is becoming under more strict military control, he is envious of K's freedom. K changes the medical officer's outlook on life: the medical officer fantasizes about following K and begging K to let him live like him. Themes=The value of human life Michael K is often seen as a parasite, or unskilled worker throughout this book. He doesn't have a very high social status and he is aware of that. At times he purposely acts dumb, like not speaking, because he knows he can get away with it. However, Michael knows that he still has a purpose in this world but it takes him the whole book to discover what that purpose is. He spends his time living off the land one day at a time. He doesn't realize until later that he was born to be a gardener. The goal of his journey is not to find his purpose but to assist his mother and fulfill her wishes, what he believed to be his original purpose in life. Michael happens to stumble upon his gardening skills by doing what he had to for survival. He loves his life as a gardener and realizes that most other people wouldn't be able to survive as he did. There are times where he questions his love for gardening when others tell him that he should be a fencer, just as everyone questions if they're making the right choice. He believes that,\\"A man must live so that he leaves no trace of his living.\\" Becoming a gardener is Michael's best bet for living out his philosophy. Mother/Son enmeshment Michael is closely emotionally attached to his mother, such that he is unable to express an emotional response to the world outside of this relationship. He is held within the matrix of this relationship, and having never learned to engage with the world outside, expresses great distress whenever challenged to do so. The medical officer sums up this relationship, writing to Michael, \\"[...] you should have got away at an early age from that mother of yours, who sounds like a real killer. [...] [Whilst] performing all the other feats of filial piety you no doubt performed, I also think of her sitting on your shoulders, eating out your brains, glaring about triumphantly, the very embodiment of great Mother Death.\\" Michael exhibits some growth at the end of the story, through contact with kind peers. Time In the conclusion, Michael ponders whether the moral of his story is \\"that there is enough time for everything.\\" The concept of time is present throughout the whole novel. The books ends with a metaphor: \\"[H]e would lower [the spoon] down the shaft deep into the earth, and when he brought it up there would be water in the bowl of the spoon; and in that way, he would say, one can live.\\" War and military authority The novel takes place in South Africa during a civil war in the 1970-80s, and K often crosses paths with soldiers throughout the story. These tend, based on flimsy or non- existent evidence, to accuse K and other people of various crimes such as theft or sabotage, while themselves performing corresponding acts of aggression with impunity. K is also more than once drafted into forced labour and placed in camps that vaguely resemble concentration camps. The inmates are given food, but eventually K rejects it. This appears to be a passive resistance to internment and arbitrary authority, though K may be only vaguely aware of his motives. He grows weaker and weaker until he finally escapes. Later on he is taken to a hospital instead, because he is too weak to work. He is better treated here, but nevertheless again refuses to eat and escapes. He does not evince much interest in the war, except as the soldiers pose a threat to him, from which he must hide or risk repeated internment or violence. Race The story, which takes place during the apartheid regime and related racial conflicts, makes a reference to race, specifically, that there is a war \\"so that minorities can have a say in their own destinies.\\" This line, spoken by a character in the hospital Michael stays in, implies Michael interacts with soldiers in the white side of a war between races in South Africa. It is also implied at various points that this side is losing the war. The only other instance race is specified is in Part 1 of the novel, \\"Michael Visagie--CM--40--NFA--Unemployed\\". \\"CM\\" stands for \\"colored male\\" therefore telling the reader that Michael \\"Visagie\\" (which isn't Michael's surname) is an unemployed, 40-year-old, colored male with No Fixed Address. However, we are not told what race other characters belong to, nor are there any references to race politics or confrontations or any racial slurs in the dialogue. References * J. M. Coetzee.

He formed Jonathan Kelly's Outside in 1973. Biography Born in Drogheda, County Louth, he attended Drogheda Grammar School. He played bass guitar for Humpy Bong which featured former Bee Gees drummer Colin Petersen. The band did not progress but released one single, \\"Don't You Be Too Long\\". Kelly would then retain Petersen as his manager and release two albums through RCA, Twice Around the Houses and Wait til They Change the Backdrop. Outside was made up of Kelly, Snowy White and Chas Jankel on guitars, Dave Sheen on drums and Trevor Williams (ex-Audience) on bass guitar. White went on to play with Pink Floyd and Thin Lizzy before a successful solo career, and Jankel later played with Ian Dury and the Blockheads. One album was recorded, ...Waiting On You, in 1974, with an accompanying single \\"...Waiting On You\\"/\\"Outside\\", before the band members went their separate ways. Kelly stopped performing in 1976. However, between 2004 and 2007, he returned to performing a few solo acoustic concerts at small venues. Kelly died on 2 May 2020, after a long illness.

He presided over an era of controversy that included the setting up of the Racing Development Fund, ministerial re-zonings and the licensing of Jupiters Casino. His career in public life spanned almost four decades, first in local government in the 1950s and 1960s, and then in the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1966 to 1988. His exit from Parliament occurred amid allegations that he had received corrupt payments. Early life Oxenford Russell James Hinze was born on 19 June 1919 in Oxenford on the Gold Coast of Queensland. His father was a dairy farmer.Bob Katter, An Incredible Race of People: A Passionate History of Australia, Millers Point, New South Wales: Murdoch Books Australia, 2012, p. 300 He started his career as a sugar cane cutter. Later, he took up dairy- farming, like his father.  Politics  After becoming chairman of the South Coast Cooperative Dairy Association, he was elected to the Albert Shire Council in the early 1950s, serving as shire chairman for nine years from 1958 to 1967. In 1966, Hinze entered the State political arena as the member for South Coast, representing the then Country Party. After eight years as a backbench member of the Coalition Government, he was promoted to Cabinet. In 1971, while still a backbencher, he was part of a plot within the Country Party parliamentary wing to topple Joh Bjelke-Petersen that failed only when Bjelke-Petersen broke a tie in the party-room meeting by voting for himself. Between 1974 and 1987, he served as the Minister for Local Government and Main Roads. Between 1980 and 1987, he served as the Minister for Racing. Between 1980 and 1982, he served as the Minister for Police.Bob Katter, An Incredible Race of People: A Passionate History of Australia, Millers Point, New South Wales: Murdoch Books Australia, 2012, p. 297 These ministerial positions earned him the commonly known title of 'Minister for Everything'.Hansard, 16 July 1991, pp. 6, 10, 14 Headstone in Lower Coomera cemetery In May 1988, Hinze resigned from Queensland Parliament after damaging allegations were made against him during the Fitzgerald Inquiry, which was investigating corruption in Queensland during the Bjelke-Petersen era. Later life In December 1989 Hinze was charged on eight counts of having received corrupt payments of $520,000. However, he died from bowel cancer on 29 June 1991 aged 72 at the Allamanda Private Hospital in Southport, before the case went to trial. He was buried in Lower Coomera cemetery on the Gold Coast. After his death in 1991 Queensland Deputy Premier Tom Burns remembered him in parliament with the following anecdote: \\"The best cartoon of him was the one that showed him as a bulldog. I saw him on television describing why he would rather be a bulldog than a mouse, but he was shown as a bulldog with dark glasses and a white cane outside a casino and brothel in the Valley that had a flashing neon light, saying he did not know there were any there.\\" Although the charges against Hinze were never proven in court, in 1990 another court case arising from the Fitzgerald enquiry convicted businessman George Herscu of paying Hinze $100,000 to enable a shopping centre development to go ahead. Herscu claimed he had paid Hinze to purchase racehorses for Herscu. Legacy Hinze Dam was named in honour of local pioneers Carl and Johanna Hinze (grandparents of Russ Hinze) who lived in the valley that was flooded by the dam. His granddaughter, Kristy Hinze, is a model.

Until it was secularised in 1802 it was an Imperial Abbey, with sovereignty over the whole town of Helmstedt until the 15th century.  History  St. Ludger's Abbey Shortly before 800 the missionary Ludger entered the area of Helmstedt with Charlemagne in order to convert the Saxons. Ludger founded the monastery on an ancient road, the Reichsstrasse, on the site of an ancient German shrine by a holy spring. The monastery's position on this important trade route was extremely advantageous in the Middle Ages, as great financial benefits derived from the constant passage of traders. The significance of the monastery for Helmstedt is reflected in the town's arms, which depict Saint Ludger. The monastery premises were rebuilt after the Thirty Years' War in the Baroque style; the ornamental monastery gateway (the so-called Turks' Gate) and the dovecote were added in the 18th century. The monastery was secularised during the Napoleonic Wars, in 1802, and the possession of the site passed to the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, after which it was managed as an agricultural estate. The buildings, including the monastery church, suffered severe damage during World War II, but have been restored. There has been a Catholic school here from at least the 18th century and there has been a kindergarten for several decades. St. Ludger's was a sister house of Werden Abbey (incorporated into Essen in 1923). The monasteries were managed in tandem, as reflected in the arms of both houses, each of which bears twin abbots' staffs.

The Brunonids are assumed to be descendants of Brun, Duke of Saxony (d. 880). This would make them the senior branch of the Liudolfing house, to which the Ottonian emperors also belonged. This relationship is considered likely because the names Brun and Liudolf are both common among the Brunonids, and their properties are located in the same areas as the properties of the early Liudolfings. In addition, contemporaries seemed to regard the Brunonids as male-line relatives of the Ottonian kings, as shown by the candidacy for king of Brun I, Count of Brunswick. However, there is no evidence that the Brunonids are related to the Liudolfings, and nothing is known about the existence of any children of Duke Brun. The oldest properties of the Brunonids were located in the Derlingau, from which they spread their influence to adjacent areas. The town of Brunswick, located at the western edge of the Derlingau, became their comital seat in the 9th or 10th century; according to legends, Brunswick (the name literally means \\"Brun's town\\") was founded by one of the Brunonids named Brun ‚Äî it is unclear by which one. Their county came to be known as the County of Brunswick. The next assumed member of the Brunonid (Brunoner) house was a Count Liudolf, who was mentioned in 942. The first certain member of the house was Brun I, Count of Brunswick, who is attested since 991. Count Bruno I sought without success to succeed Otto III in 1002 as King of the Romans. In 1067, Bruno's grandson Egbert was granted the Margraviate of Meissen by Emperor Henry IV. His son, Egbert II, opposed that same ruler and lost his rights to both Meissen and Frisia. Egbert II's death marked the end of the Brunonid line. Egbert II's sister, Gertrude of Brunswick, had a daughter with her second husband, Henry the Fat, Margrave of Frisia of Northeim. This daughter, Richenza (d. 1141) married Lothar of S√ºpplingenburg, who was Duke of Saxony and later became Holy Roman Emperor. Their daughter Gertrude (d. 1143) married Duke Henry the Proud of Saxony and Bavaria, a member of the House of House of Welf. In this way, the Welf dynasty gained the Brunonid properties around Brunswick, which they would hold until the 20th century.

Two vintages of Ch√¢teau Giscours, 1970 and 2003. Ch√¢teau Giscours is a winery in the Margaux appellation of the Bordeaux region of France, in the commune of Labarde. The wine produced here was classified as one of fourteen Troisi√®mes Crus (Third Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. History The first written reference to the domain of Giscours, a deed confirming the sale of the estate, dates from 1330 and refers to a fortified keep. Records of Giscours' vineyards go back to 1552 when Seigneur de la Bastide sold it to Pierre de l'Horme. Prior to the French Revolution Giscours belonged to the Saint-Simon family before it was confiscated, and then bought by two Americans in 1793, John Gray and Jonathan Davis of Boston. Several owners followed, and Giscours' great era began with the purchase of the property by the banker Count de Pescatore in 1845, who in 1847 hired Pierre Skawinski to manage his estate. Skawinski proved to be one of the great agriculturalists of M√©doc in the 19th century, in 1860 the inventor of a plough which bears his name, and a pioneer in the fight against mildew, he was instrumental in making Giscours one of the most reputable third growths. Skawinski managed the estate for 50 years, also during the following ownership by the Cruse family, the estate's most successful period. The family sold Giscours in 1913, and many difficult years followed. In 1954 the estate was purchased by Nicolas Tari, formerly a large-scale winemaker in Algeria, who restored and enlarged the property, making it one of the most productive estates in the M√©doc. In 1976, the then- owner of the ch√¢teau and President of the Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux, Pierre Tari, was selected as one of 11 judges to take part in the \\"Judgment of Paris\\" wine competition. In 1995, Ch√¢teau Giscours' wine growing business activities were acquired by Eric Albada Jelgersma. Wine fraud case In 1998 Jelgersma, along with then director of the estate, Jean Michel Ferrandez, and Pascal Froidefond were indicted on charges of wine fraud, charged with blending AOC Margaux and AOC Haut Medoc fruit in nearly 200,000 bottles of the 1995 vintage of the ch√¢teau's second wine, La Sirene de Giscours, with further allegations that the blend was doctored with milk, water and fruit acids. The accusations were brought as a result of a former employee who had become a whistle-blower. The case came before the Bordeaux courts in June, 2008. The decision was not allowed to be made public. Production From an estate of nearly 400 hectares, the Giscours planted vineyard area extends 80 hectares spread out over several plots. The composition of grape varieties is 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot and the remainder Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Of the Grand vin Chateau Giscours there is annually produced 25,000 cases, and of the second wine La Sir√®ne de Giscours there is typically produced 10,000 cases. A 40 hectare plot of vines adjacent to Giscours outside the Margaux boundary is bottled as Le Haut M√©doc de Giscours. Other wines produced by the estate include Ch√¢teau Dutheil and Ch√¢teau Houringe, both Haut-M√©doc cru bourgeois properties, the former is vinified at Giscours, the latter is since 1982 operated on a lease. Cricket Ch√¢teau Giscours is the home ground of the Bordeaux Giscours Cricket Club, participants in the Aquitaine Division of the French National League and current National Champions.

A murder mystery set in 1808, it touches on historical prejudice against Roman Catholicism in the Joseon Kingdom. Although primarily a period thriller, director Kim Dae-seung weaves together an unconventional mix of styles‚Äîa puzzle-box mystery plot traditionally associated with detective fiction, class-conscious social commentary, lush cinematography, sets and costume design, and a flair for gore.  Plot  It is 1808 on Donghwa Island, a small island with a technologically advanced paper mill. The presence of the mill has spawned a bustling village, and given its townspeople a certain degree of wealth. With climate and trees perfectly suited for papermaking‚Äîand a location remote enough to ensure both privacy and secrecy‚Äîthe island has established a profitable business in high quality paper, with trade routes stretching as far away as China. This isolated and largely autonomous island begins to be plagued by a string of gruesome murders. However, it's not just the mounting death toll that is causing residents to worry, but the sadistic, methodical way in which the victims were killed. With the killer still on the loose, the government sends in special investigator Wonkyu to crack the case. While conducting his dogged investigation, he soon uncovers myriad hidden secrets, tracing the murders back to an incident that occurred some seven years earlier, in which the former owner of the mill was executed for practicing Catholicism. The townspeople, for their part, are convinced that the dead man's ghost has come back for revenge. As the young officer digs deeper into the island's dark past, Wonkyu discovers that there may be something even more frightening than the murders or the murderer‚Äîa truth that will make him question the depths of human nature.

Established in 1912, it is the longest existing flying training school. Its motto is Imprimis Praecepta which is Latin for \\"Our Teaching is Everlasting\\". It currently manages a series of training squadrons as well as the RAF Display Team. History Folland Gnat advanced trainer of the Central Flying School at RAF Little Rissington in 1967 Gloster Meteor T.7 of the CFS at RAF Coltishall in 1969 It was established at Upavon Aerodrome, near Upavon, Wiltshire on 12 May 1912. It was later based at RAF Little Rissington, from 1946 to 1976. The CFS's first commandant was Captain Godfrey Paine RN. It has been responsible for instructor training since 1920, with pilot training being delegated to the Flying Training Schools. Display teams When the Red Arrows, the RAF's sole aerobatic team was formed by amalgamation of other teams, the responsibility was transferred to the CFS from Fighter Command. The Red Arrows moved to RAF Scampton in 1983 when the CFS was moved there and out in 1995‚Äì though the Red Arrows returned in 2000. Elementary flying training The section started using de Havilland Chipmunk T.10 and Scottish Aviation Bulldog T.1. In 2000 the Grob Tutor T.1 replaced the Scottish Aviation Bulldog as the initial trainer operated by the unit. Fast jet training During the 1950s the CFS was equipped with the Gloster Meteor. During 1976 the Hawker Siddeley Gnat T.1s were based at RAF Valley however during 1977 these were replaced as the CFS main advanced jet trainer by the Hawker Siddeley Hawk T.1. From 1993 the Short Tucano took the place of the BAC Jet Provost. Helicopter training Helicopter instruction began in 1955 on the Westland Dragonfly and Bristol Sycamore at RAF South Cerney in Gloucestershire. It moved to RAF Ternhill in August 1961. From 1966, the Westland-built Sioux helicopter began service, lasting until 1973, when replaced with the Westland Gazelle HT.2s, much more reminiscent of modern-day helicopters. During the 1970s the Westland Whirlwind HAR.10s were also used and the School had a detachment at RAF Valley, Anglesey, Wales for SAR and mountain rescue training. In 1997 the Gazelle HT.2's and HT.3's were replaced by the Squirrel (Eurocopter AS350), and the Griffin (Bell 412) is also used. RAF Shawbury has been the home of the helicopter training school since 1977, becoming the Defence Helicopter Flying School in 1997. A satellite unit of the CFS is maintained at RAF Shawbury to train and develop helicopter instructors.

Kim Ki-duk's direction throughout is excellent. His visuals capture the unremitting empty desolation of the villager's surroundings. With Seo Jeong-min's cinematography, the picture looks grimy and cold, like it's been dragged across the damp, dirty ground before being processed. There's very little in the way of the pretty or picturesque, the colour palette exuding a subdued and murky feel. Also, he maintains the heavy sense of metaphor within the piece. So often do scenes go on behind closed doors, or are obscured by plastic sheeting, branches or chain-link fences. Much of it also unfolds at a distance.

Together with his wife, Katharine Cook (1863‚Äì1938), he established a maternity training school in Uganda.  Medical and missionary career  Albert Cook was born in Hampstead, London in 1870. His parents were Dr. W.H. Cook and Harriet Bickersteth Cook. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1893 with a bachelor's degree, and from St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1895 as a bachelor of medicine. He became a doctor of medicine in 1901. In 1896, Albert Cook went to Uganda with a Church Missionary Society mission, and in 1897 he established Mengo Hospital, the oldest hospital in East Africa. In 1899 he was joined by his older brother John Howard Cook, a surgeon and ophthalmologist. Albert Cook married Katharine Timpson, a missionary nurse, in 1900, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Albert Ruskin Cook in Uganda, 1897 Sir Albert Cook was unusual among medical missionaries because of his efforts to train Africans to become skilled medical workers. He and his wife opened a school for midwives at Mengo and authored a manual of midwifery in Ganda, the local language (Amagezi Agokuzalisa; published by Sheldon Press, London). Albert Cook started training African medical assistants at Mulago during the First World War, and in the 1920s, encouraged the opening of a medical College that initially trained Africans to the level defined by the colonial government as \\"Asian sub-assistant surgeon\\". The school grew to become a fully fledged medical school in his lifetime. Cook established a treatment centre for the venereal diseases and sleeping sickness in 1913, which later became Mulago Hospital. He was president of the Uganda Branch of the British Medical Association (BMA) between 1914 and 1918, during which time he founded a school for African medical assistants.  Honours  Cook was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1918, the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1922, and received a knighthood in 1932. In 1936‚Äì37, he was again president of BMA (Uganda Branch). Sir Albert Cook died on 23 April 1951 in Kampala.

The Australian Taxation Office held this was tax avoidance, but the test case was decided in favour of the taxpayer, one of the students, Brian Cridland. In the taxonomy of tax schemes, this one was in the category of a wholly intentional tax benefit but which people other than those intended came to access. Amendments tightening the definition of a primary producer were subsequently made, so such a scheme would fail today.  Scheme  In 1968, Brisbane accountant D. P. O'Shea was a partner in the firm Fadden and O'Shea and was, as the court said, \\"versed in the arts of tax minimization\\". He hit upon a scheme to access the income averaging provisions of division 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA). Income averaging allowed a taxpayer to spread income over multiple tax years and was meant for primary producers (farmers etc.) with highly variable incomes. Section 157 provided that if a trust is carrying on a business of primary production, then all the income beneficiaries are likewise considered carrying on such a business. O'Shea had one of his companies acquire land and lease (or otherwise grant) use of that to newly formed unit trusts. Those trusts were to acquire livestock or similar so as to carry on a business of primary production. The money for all this was lent by O'Shea or associates and the trusts were to end after 21 years, at which point all assets reverted to him or associates. The actual assets and production, it seems, were to be small, and in any case remain effectively under O'Shea's control. In 1969 O'Shea distributed pamphlets advertising his scheme at universities in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Students were to pay a nominal sum of $1 to join. Over 5,000 responded and became beneficiaries of the No. 1 trust. Brian Cridland, the subject of the court action, was a student at the University of Queensland nearing the end of his engineering degree course. He became a beneficiary of the No. 2 trust and then in 1970 was transferred to the No. 4 trust when the No. 2 ceased operation. The payment of $1 each was not meant to make a profit for O'Shea and associates, in fact it was seldom collected. The trust deeds allowed the trustee to register a person if the trustee was satisfied the person had donated at least $1 either to an institution under section 78 of the ITAA (various museums, cultural funds, etc.), or to a similar body approved by a university Student Representative Council. O'Shea even made a $500 payment to a section 78 body himself to cover anyone who might fail to have a documented payment themselves (and therefore might have failed to meet the formal requirements of the scheme). Any income actually earned by the trusts would, or would not be, distributed to some or all beneficiaries entirely at the discretion of the trustee. Beneficiaries were not actually going to receive income, or nothing significant, just be \\"presently entitled\\" to satisfy section 157. Cridland for instance said to the court he didn't expect any income, he did receive $1 in each of June 1969, 1970 and 1971 though. The pamphlets described an annual payment of $50 to be made by subscribers, but only if and when they saved at least that much tax. It also pointed out there was no way anyone could be forced to make such a payment, it would rely on the honesty of participants. No such amounts were actually paid. It seems O'Shea made no profit from the scheme. Presumably if he was creating a scheme for himself anyway then it cost little to let others join, and perhaps the scheme brought other business for his accounting firm.  Courts  The Australian Taxation Office decided the scheme was a form of tax avoidance, and under the general anti-avoidance provision of ITAA section 260 (which was operative at that time) they ignored Cridland's interest in the trusts and issued assessments for tax years ending 30 June 1970, 1971 and 1972 accordingly. Cridland took the matter to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, where Justice Mahoney agreed with the commissioner.Cridland v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1976) 6 ATR 212; 9 ALR 631; 76 ATC 4095 (13 May 1976) , Supreme Court (NSW). Section 260 was worded very broadly, striking out any agreement \\"altering the incidence of any income tax\\". If taken literally then almost any everyday business transaction would come under it. Consequently, it had been \\"read down\\" in case law over the years to decide when it should not apply. This included not applying it to transactions \\"of a normal character\\", nor as decided in Keighery v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1957) to matters where the statute contains alternatives available to the taxpayer (in that case a public versus private company).. Cridland argued that this latter \\"choice principle\\" applied, that becoming the beneficiary of a trust was a choice allowed by section 157; and if the statute explicitly provides consequences for people in certain positions then they should be able to utilize those. Justice Mahoney decided section 157 was not a choice in this sense and which the taxpayer could make of themselves, and indeed regarded the section as having a more mechanical nature so that primary producers operating their business via a trust could come under division 16. Cridland appealed to the High Court, where Chief Justice Barwick and Justices Stephen, Mason, Jacobs and Aickin instead unanimously found for him and against the ATO, holding the choice principle was not so narrow as Mahoney had interpreted it. The justices followed their own High Court decision in Mullens v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1976),. not decided until after Mahoney had made his judgement. In Mullens they determined that if the statute provides certain consequences then a taxpayer may enter into circumstances or transactions to which the statute applies, and that section 260 does not strike those out just because this is to the taxpayer's advantage. The justices were in no doubt though that a transaction like Cridland had entered into was not normal for a university student, and was only explicable for attracting the income averaging provisions, but such considerations could not override the fact that the transaction was one to which specific provisions of the ITAA applied.  Subsequently  Following the High Court's decision, Treasurer John Howard introduced amendments in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1978 restricting the definition of a primary producer in section 157. As from 1 July 1978 there are now two further requirements, * A minimum $1,040 must be received from the trust. * The Commissioner of Taxation must be satisfied the beneficiary's interest wasn't acquired primarily for the purpose of obtaining income averaging. These requirements act to prevent a similar broad-based scheme today, but don't deny income averaging benefits to farming families operating their business through a trust. (Trusts as an ownership structure have some advantages for ongoing family businesses and are and were quite often used in farming.)

Munich 1972: Tragedy, Terror, and Triumph at the Olympic Games: p196. who led the Munich massacre, an invasion into the Munich Olympic Village on 5 September 1972 taking nine members of Israel's Olympic team hostage after killing two members who had resisted. He was the chief negotiator on behalf of the Palestinians, who were members of the Black September offshoot of Yassir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization. Afif and four of his compatriots were killed by German snipers at F√ºrstenfeldbruck airbase outside of Munich. Early life All that is known of Afif's early life is gleaned from conversations he had with Munich policewoman Annaliese Graes during the hostage crisis. It may be safely presumed that none of the statements below are definitive or verifiable. Luttif Afif was born in Nazareth. His mother was Jewish, while his father was a wealthy Christian Arab businessman from Nazareth. Afif had three other brothers, all were in Black September, two of whom were in Israeli jails. In 1958 he moved to West Germany to study engineering, learned the language and then moved to France to work. According to Reeve, he enjoyed the time spent in Europe, but joined Fatah in 1966, possibly while residing in Germany. Issa returned to the Middle East to fight several battles against Israeli soldiers. Abu Iyad, the head of Black September, wrote that both Afif and his second in command Tony had both fought in Amman in September 1970 and in the battle of Jerash and Ajlun in July 1971. In the early 1970s, he was living in Berlin and was engaged to a young German woman.  The Munich massacre  According to several sources, including Serge Groussard and Simon Reeve, Afif claimed that his own personal reason for taking the Israelis hostage was to get his two brothers out of Israeli prisons. Afif was described by Manfred Schreiber, chief of the Munich police and one of the German negotiators, as \\"very cool and determined, clearly fanatical in his convictions\\" who expressed his demands in a forceful manner and at times \\"sounded like [one of] those people who aren't completely anchored in reality.\\" For Walther Tr√∂ger, then-Mayor of the Olympic Village, Afif gave the impression of being an \\"intelligent and reasonable man,\\" unlike his comrades, who in the eyes of the Olympic official were \\"gallow birds\\" (German: Galgenv√∂gel). Tr√∂ger said of course he did not like Afif because of what he was doing, but he could have liked him if he had met him elsewhere. Afif spent most of his time in front of 31 Connollystra√üe chatting with either the German delegation or the young policewoman Anneliese Graes. According to Graes, Afif spoke fluent German with a French accent. She described him as \\"always polite and correct.\\" When he was asked not to wave his hand grenade in front of her, he simply laughed and replied, \\"you have nothing to fear from me\\". Graes also found the terrorist leader more peculiar. He explained how he had worked in the Olympic Village 'Milk Bar' and had enjoyed dancing around in front of the bar, though Graes did not believe him. Afif told Graes he had worked in France for several years and every now and again would drop the phrase \\"oo-la-la\\" into their conversations. After tense negotiations, the hostage crisis ended after 21 hours with a bungled ambush of the hostage takers at F√ºrstenfeldbruck airbase outside of Munich. Afif and four of his compatriots were killed by German snipers, but not before machine-gunning all nine remaining hostages and blowing up a helicopter containing four of them with a hand grenade. Afif is reported in most accounts of the event (and depicted in the films Munich and 21 Hours at Munich) as the guerrilla who threw the hand grenade into the eastern helicopter. Autopsy reports show that the hostages in this helicopter were shot as well; it stands to reason that Afif performed both actions. Another fedayeen, identified by Simon Reeve as Adnan Al-Gashey, then machine- gunned the remaining hostages in the western helicopter seconds after. The bodies of Afif and his four compatriots were turned over to Libya, and after a procession from Tripoli's Martyrs' Square, were buried in the Sidi Munaidess Cemetery.  In literature and cinema  In Serge Groussard's The Blood of Israel, Issa was misidentified as Mohammed Safady, one of the Munich gunmen who actually survived the F√ºrstenfeldbruck gunfight. Another identity was suggested for Issa in Aaron Klein's Striking Back; he identifies the terrorist leader as Mohammed Massalha, who turned out to be Afif's own father. Afif has been portrayed by Franco Nero in the 1976 TV movie 21 Hours at Munich, and by French actor Karim Saleh in Steven Spielberg's film Munich (2005).

Background \\"A Match at the Badger\\" by Henry Alken circa 1820 The badger is a usually quiet and docile creature in its own domain; however, when cornered or when a threat is perceived it can possess impressive courage. Weighing up to thirty-five pounds when fully grown, the badger has an extraordinarily dangerous bite, which it is willing to use when threatened. In addition, badgers have extremely powerful claws, used for digging in hard earth, which are more than capable of injuring a dog. A formidable adversary for any dog, the badger was a sought- after victim for the fighting pit. Drawing the badger \\"Drawing the Badger\\" by Henry Alken circa 1820 In order to use the badger's ability to defend itself to test the dog, artificial badger dens were built, captured badgers were put in them and then the dog was set on the badger. The badger would be placed in a box, which was furnished in imitation of its den and from there a tunnel led upward. The owner of the badger puts his animal in the box. The timekeeper is equipped with a watch and the badger's owner releases the dog for the fight. Whoever wants to pit his dog against the badger lets it slide into the tunnel. Usually the dog is seized immediately by the badger and the dog in turn grips the badger. Each bites, tears and pulls the other with all their might. The owner of the dog quickly pulls out the dog whose jaws are clamped obstinately onto the badger by its tail. The two are separated and the badger is returned to its den. Then the dog is sent back in to seize the badger and it again is drawn out with the badger. This scene is repeated over and over again. The more often a dog is able to seize the badger within a minute, so that both can be pulled out together, the more it is up to the task and is considered game. \\"Badger Baiting\\" by Henry Alken circa 1824 Drawing the badger came to England in the 18th century and soon became a very popular sideshow in the pit. It provided a new opportunity to win or lose money by betting. Drawing the badger thus became a permanent part of the fight in the pit. Baits were staged outside the pit in cellars or taverns, as an interesting attraction for the guests. Towards the middle of the 19th century Badger-baiting declined in popularity to be replaced by dog fighting, although some countryside villages kept holding such activities the Sunday after church. Badger dogs Some dog breeds were specifically developed for badger-baiting whilst several other breeds were used in this task in addition to more general vermin control; breeds include the Dachshund and terriers like the extinct Bull-and-terrier. Animal cruelty Apart from the cruelty towards badgers, dogs are also brutalized in the blood sport. Dogs usually suffer injuries to the face and neck. In some cases, the injuries are such that the dogs must be euthanized. Today, baiters often refrain from taking injured dogs to veterinarians as the doctor might understand what has taken place and report the owners to the police. For this reason the badger is often crippled and/or restrained to minimise the risk of injury to dogs. The badger's long front claws may be filed off; the canine teeth may be pulled out; the animal's limbs or jaw may be broken with a shovel. To inhibit the badger's movement, there are rumours that the tendons in its hind legs may be cut. Griffiths et al. mention nailing badgers to the ground by the tail. When the badger can no longer fight, it is killed by the baiters using methods such as shooting, stabbing, or beating to death with a shovel. Dead badgers are sometimes dumped by the roadside to be mistaken for roadkill. Legal standing Badger baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom as early as 1835, with the Cruelty to Animals Act. The practice of baiting of animals is now specifically forbidden under the Protection of Animals Act 1911. Moreover, the cruelty towards and death of the badger constitute offences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, and further offences under this act are inevitably committed to facilitate badger baiting (such as interfering with a sett, or the taking or the very possession of a badger for purposes other than nursing an injured animal to health). If convicted, badger baiters may face a sentence of up to 6 months in jail, a fine of up to ¬£5000, as well as other punitive measures, such as community service or a ban from owning dogs. In the Republic of Ireland, badgers and their setts are protected under the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the Wildlife Amendment Act, 2000. Modern times Despite having been illegal for over 170 years, badger baiting has continued in a clandestine manner throughout Britain and Ireland until the present day. In February 2009, the Sunday Times reported that badger-baiting is practised by \\"hardcore terrier men\\" who are internationally organized. The Sunday Times has also reported that there is little attention on the part of the Irish government towards animal cruelty in general. The report led to a police operation in Ulster in which a number of dogs were seized, but no arrests were made. In Ireland the NPWS has secured ten convictions for the illegal persecution of badgers in the last 20 years. In 2009, badger baiting was believed to be on the rise according to animal welfare organizations. Badger-baiting is often linked to other criminal activities, and some practitioners brag on social networks about their deeds. In 2018, David Thomas was sentenced to 22 weeks and his accomplice to 20 for setting dogs on badgers. Crime gangs, among them Northern Irish paramilitaries, have been reported to sell badgers for up to ¬£700 to fight with dogs. See alsoReferencesFurther reading *Fleig, D. (1996).

It is the sequel to My Wife is a Gangster and is itself followed by My Wife Is a Gangster 3.  Plot  In the beginning of the movie the Scissor gang are fighting some unknown gang on the rooftop. The other gang starts to get the upper hand and are about to kill Robocop but he is saved by Eun-jin (Shin Eun- kyung), the Scissor gang's boss also known as 'Silverfish'. However, during the fight she falls from the top of the building. Due to a lucky break, the fall doesn't kill her, but it does cause her to suffer amnesia. Luckily for Eun-jin, she's found by Choi Yoon-jae (Park Jun-gyu), the kindly owner of a small-scale Chinese restaurant. She worked as a delivery girl under the name of Tsu Tsu. She tries several times to regain her memory but fails in each attempt. During one of her deliveries, she happens to be at the bank which is being put under heist when one of the robber starts kicking a pregnant woman. Regaining a part of her memory about she getting kicked by Nanman, she then beats up all three of the robbers and prevents the bank robbery. Meanwhile, the White Shark from earlier movie along with his several henchmen has survived the fire and have returned to the neighborhood. He plans to demolish the buildings from the neighborhood of Yoon-jae's restaurant and build a big mall there, but he happens to see Eun-jin as she is being awarded for her bravery of preventing a bank robbery. He inquires about her and learns from a local hoodlum that she is working as a delivery girl. He asks the hoodlum to make an order so that they may get to know her. But when she appears with the delivery he immediately recognizes her as the 'Silverfish' and hires Jun-man, brother of Nanman, to kill her. Once, in a feud with Ji-hyun, Tsu Tsu fell from the roof and recovered her past memories with White Shark, who had recruited Jun-man to kill her. Jun-man became impotent when Yoon-jae's motorbike accidentally hit him in the groin. Ji-hyun was later kidnapped by the White Shark gang and they call Yoon-jae and threaten him to sell his daughter to brothel if he doesn't tell them about Eun-jin's whereabouts. When Eun-jin hears of these events she goes to save Ji-hyun but while she was being rescued by Eun-jin, Yoon-jae gets stabbed in the stomach and killed. Eun-jin was saved by the 132-members of the Scissor gang. Ji-hyun later joined Eun- jin's gang to fight against some Chinese illegal drug dealers.

Its poetry is taken from Joseph Eichendorff's collection entitled Intermezzo. Schumann wrote two cycles of this name ‚Äì the other being his Opus 24, to texts by Heinrich Heine ‚Äì so this work is also known as the Eichendorff Liederkreis. Of this cycle Schumann said, \\"The voice alone cannot reproduce everything or produce every effect; together with the expression of the whole the finer details of the poem should also be emphasized; and all is well so long as the vocal line is not sacrificed.\\"http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/liederkreis- op-39-robert-schumann Liederkreis, Opus 39, is regarded as one of the great song cycles of the 19th century, capturing, in essence, the Romantic experience of landscape.Andreas Dorschel, Listening to Landscape: A Romantic Evocation of Sound and Mood. In: Roger Scruton (ed.), Chora: Landscape and Mindscape. The Alpine Foundation, Venice 2018, pp. 62‚Äì75, p. 68. Schumann wrote it starting in May 1840, the year in which he wrote such a large number of lieder that it is known as his \\"year of song\\" or '. Songs The cycle consists of twelve songs: # \\"In der Fremde\\" # \\"Intermezzo\\" # \\"Waldesgespr√§ch\\" # \\"Die Stille\\" # \\"Mondnacht\\" # \\"Sch√∂ne Fremde\\" # \\"Auf einer Burg\\" # \\"In der Fremde\\" # \\"Wehmut\\" # \\"Zwielicht\\" # \\"Im Walde\\" # \\"Fr√ºhlingsnacht\\"  \\"In der Fremde\\" = Form  The form of \\"In der Fremde\\" is ambiguous: there are arguments that it is through-composed and that it is in the A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA form. The evidence that \\"In der Fremde\\" is through-composed is found in both the melody and the harmony. The harmonic pattern is inconsistent enough to be through composed: The piece modulates from F minor, to A major, to B minor, then back to F minor. Within each of these keys, the general structure is comparable, but the last significant section (mm 22‚Äì28) is strikingly different. With each modulation, the melody changes. The modulations are not directly congruent with the stanza changes, which points to a through-composed piece. It can be argued that \\"In der Fremde\\" takes an A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚ÄìC form. Though they are in different keys, the first and third sections (A) have nearly the same melody and comparable harmonic structures. The second section (B) has all new melodic material and is in a major mode which contrasts with the A section. The final section is new material; it \\"echoes the last line of the first quatrain [and] stands in for a return of the entire quatrain‚Äù, but does not constitute a restatement of the A section. The form could also be interpreted as A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA‚Ä≤ if the focus is predominantly on the vocal line. There is a recurring motif between the A and A‚Ä≤ sections, and the difference between the two sections can be found in sparse accidentals and different intervals that make the variations on the original motif. The big difference is the change in key, as the A‚Ä≤ section is in B minor before the song modulates back to the home key, F minor.  Text  The text of this poem is simple in meaning. The speaker can be interpreted as either going to a forest or as already being in the forest, a place that is beautiful for its solitude. This poem is composed primarily of symbols that can be interpreted both literally and figuratively, the point this analysis will be pursuing. The red flashes of lightning are clearly aligned to show that his home life is no longer something that he feels safe calling his own. Since the lightning is red, a phenomenon that occurs rarely, if ever, in nature, one can imagine that the storm is not a literal one but rather something that is only occurring in his mind. This in mind, the death of the narrator's parents can serve as a metaphor. Instead of them actually being dead, the narrator is addressing them from a point of young narcissism. The narrator claims for the parents to not know their child anymore, but this is an interpretation of the parent's view of the child and how it is different from the child's self-perception. The forest serves as a place of peace for the narrator, giving them a refuge from a tumultuous home life. In a more literal interpretation, the narrator seeks the solace of death, wishing to escape a life with nothing left to offer him. The poem portrays immense feelings of loneliness when he says \\"no one [at home] knows [him/her] anymore.\\" No longer are his \\"long dead\\" Mother and Father there for him, and nor is there anybody at home for him. His descriptions of home include images of \\"lightning\\" and \\"clouds\\" that are \\"com[ing]\\". The second stanza shifts from describing the narrator's view of his home to his feelings about himself. While in the first stanza, the narrator depicts loneliness and the act of leaving behind any sense of home, the second stanza welcomes the \\"quiet time\\" with \\"rest\\" that he desires. The narrator expresses how he is resigned to his solitude and mortality. The loneliness of death is essentially an extension of the loneliness that the narrator already feels. The second stanza, while depicting the calm \\"rustle\\" of the forest, is more peaceful than the first, reflecting the relief that death would bring.  Setting to music  \\"In der Fremde\\" (Opus 39,1) Schumann opens this song cycle with the lied In der Fremde in F minor with arpeggiated chords in the piano. These broken chords impart a feeling of perpetual motion, reflecting the stormy scene set up by the narrator. The dynamics (mostly piano) suggest that the storm is far away, yet the sense of urgency is still present in the single line of continuous, moving 16th notes. In the conjunct vocal line we feel the loneliness the narrator feels as he remembers his parents and reflects on his struggle. The first stanza is accompanied completely in F minor and ends with a perfect authentic cadence. Once the tone of the poem changes, the harmonic structure follows suit. At the beginning of the second stanza, Schumann modulates to A major to reflect the narrators hopeful longing for the \\"quiet time to come.\\" The style of accompaniment in the A major section also changes, with a light and hopeful counter-melody in the right hand that stands in contrast to the metronomic urgency of the 16th notes. As the angst bleeds through from the pain of the realization that the narrator is alone, with no parents, the music lingers around the dominant in the uneasy A major. The applied chords in the beginning of this section help by tonicizing the dominant. The A major section modulates to B minor, giving a dark and unexpected ending that transitions back into the home key. When we return to the home key of F minor there is a tonic pedal that helps drive the movement to a close, giving a harmonic grounding as the moving 16th notes continue. With the addition of Neapolitan chords in measures 22 and 24, we as listeners feel the tension and unease that the narrator feels as he returns to his dark, lonely thoughts and continues towards death. Since Schumann composed this piece during the Romantic Period, the dynamics are extreme. The only dynamic markings in the entire piece are in measures 1 and 5, indicating a piano or pianissimo dynamic. Schumann's choice of such minimal dynamics reflect the narrator's quiet resignation and longing for death. Later, specifically in the A major section, there are some crescendos and diminuendos marked in the piano part. The piece also has a relatively smooth texture, since the piano is playing legato arpeggios and the voice is singing a flowing, conjunct melody. This movement of Liederkreis has several applied chords, such as V/V. Almost exclusively, these applied chords do not resolve to the expected chord. Instead, they resolve to different chords with the same harmonic functions. Throughout, there are applied chords of both the dominant (V) and subdominant (iv), which resolve to vii¬∞ and a Neapolitan chord (N), respectively. This has the effect of creating unexpected harmonic tension, heightening the emotions of the narrator.  \\"Mondnacht\\" = Form  It can be argued that the form of Mondnacht is strophic, with some slight deviations from the norm. The first two stanzas of the poetry are set to identical melodies in the vocal line, and there is also very strong similarity in the piano accompaniment, with only a few chords that differ. The digressions from the norm occur in the last stanza, where the vocal line varies in pitch, but retains the same rhythmic structure. Additionally, the repeated, blocked chords in the piano accompaniment become much thicker with the doubling of notes.  Text  It was as if the heavens Had silently kissed the earth, So that in a shower of blossoms She must only dream of him. The breeze wafted through the fields, The ears of corn waved gently, The forests rustled faintly, So sparkling clear was the night. And my soul stretched its wings out far, Flew through the hushed lands, as if it were flying home. The line \\"She must only dream of him\\" is very interesting in translation, because it is not necessarily referring to a human female and a human male. In the German language, there are feminine and masculine definite articles, which refer to other nouns as well. Looking back to the original German text, the sky (German: \\"\\") is masculine, while the Earth (\\"\\") is feminine. Knowing this, perhaps von Eichendorff is trying to create a personified relationship of sorts between the two, saying the earth must \\"only dream\\" of the sky. In the grander scheme of the poem, it can be said that von Eichendorff aimed to create an ethereal, dream-like scene, in order for the listener to understand the feelings of the narrator.

Repression of the Lydian revolt After Cyrus' conquest of Lydia in 539 BC, a Lydian official named Pactyas, whom Cyrus had honored by making him a treasury official in his own government, raised an army of Lydians and Ionian Greeks. He revolted against Tabalus, Cyrus' Satrap at Sardis in Lydia, besieging the Persian forces in the royal enclosure and stealing from the famed Lydian Horde (the riches of King Cr≈ìsus) to finance his revolt. Cyrus, upon hearing of the revolt, was enraged and made plans to punish the Lydians by burning Sardis to the ground. King Cr≈ìsus, who had been made an advisor to Cyrus' court after his defeat, entreated Cyrus to leave his former capital unharmed. According to Herodotus, Cr≈ìsus' recommendation was to disarm the population and enact trade laws that would turn the minds of the people to habits of luxury and pleasure: :\\"By doing this,\\" Cr≈ìsus advised, \\"the people will, in a short time, become so enervated and so effeminate that you will have nothing to fear from them.\\" Cyrus, who was to become known for the mercy he showed to the peoples he conquered, agreed and sent his commander Mazares to put down the insurrection according to Cr≈ìsus' wishes, with instructions to return Pactyas alive for punishment. But Pactyas fled when Marzares' forces approached the city and found refuge in Ionian Greece. Achaemenid bas-relief shows a Mede soldier behind a Persian soldier, in Persepolis, Iran Mazares gave chase, conquering the Ionian Greek city-states of Priene and Magnesia, capturing Pactyas after several attempts and sending him back to Cyrus for punishment. Mazares then continued the conquest of Asia Minor, but died of unknown causes while on campaign: Succession Cyrus then sent his leading general, Harpagus, to take his place. Harpagus completed Mazares' conquests of Asia Minor, Lycia, Cilicia and Phoenicia, using the hitherto unknown technique of building earthworks to breach the walls of besieged cities: External links *Livius.org Histories *The Baldwyn Project References Category:Generals Category:Median people Category:Military leaders of the Achaemenid Empire Category:6th-century BC deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:6th-century BC Iranian people Category:Achaemenid satraps of Lydia Category:Officials of Cyrus the Great ","title":"Mazares"},{"id":"3756689","text":"galinha √† Africana with fresh potato chips, as served near A-Ma Temple in Macau African chicken (), also known as galinha √† Africana (, is a Macanese chicken dish. African chicken consists of a barbecued chicken coated with spicy piri piri sauce, which sometimes includes Asian ingredients such as coconut milk or peanuts. The dish is sometimes considered to be a renowned Macanese dish, and is seen as a variant of piri piri Chicken. Origins There are many theories on where African chicken originated, but all invariably attribute the dish to Macau's Portuguese colonial past. One theory on the dish's origin states the dish is the brainchild of local chef Americo Angelo, who came up with the dish in a hotel kitchen in the 1940s, utilizing spices he obtained from a trip to Portugal's African colonies at the time, while another theory states the recipe has been passed down through Portuguese families in Macau for centuries. Yet another theory states the recipe was brought to Macau by retired Portuguese Army officers in the aftermath of the Carnation Revolution, who opened caf√©s and served foods they came to like during their overseas service.

Those call letters were used on WBT's first FM service at 99.9 MHz from 1947 to 1954. Clyde McLean was the original announcer on WBT-FM, and the station was purposed for \\"Storecasting\\" or playing background music for businesses in the Charlotte area. Very little advertising was sold on the station, and the company's television station, WBTV was becoming profitable for the company. For that reason, Jefferson Standard Broadcasting Company decided to abandon WBT-FM. The station's broadcasting equipment was donated to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which then started a non-commercial station, WUNC-FM. Jefferson Standard Broadcasting Company returned to FM broadcasting in 1962. The station at 107.9 was one of the first FM stereo stations in the nation. Initially, the station aired a mixture of classical music and beautiful music, but by the mid-1960s, WBT-FM was airing the beautiful music format produced by Schulke Radio Productions. On August 31, 1978, at 6 PM, WBT-FM Ron Alridge, \\"Harry Reasoner Returning to '60 Minutes' This Fall,\\" The Charlotte Observer, August 30, 1978. became \\"WBCY-108, Charlotte's Best Rock\\". According to an ad appearing in the September 1, 1978 edition of The Charlotte Observer, WBCY played 108 hours of music uninterrupted by commercials. Artists played included Chicago, Peter Frampton, The Rolling Stones, Carly Simon, Billy Joel, and Eddie Money. Popular announcers on the station during this time included John Lambis, Chris Jones, Alan Ryan, Becky Kent and Fred Story. Over the next 11 years, the station moved back and forth between adult-leaning CHR and high-energy adult contemporary. Also in 1978, Marty Lambert became Jeff Pilot, the traffic reporter for WBT and WBCY. Lambert became assistant program director and music director in 1982.Carol Hazard, \\"Former Jeff Pilot Lands Job As Merchandise Mart Official,\\" The Charlotte Observer, June 12, 1989, p. 8D. In the early '80s, WBCY hired Johnny Ray Isley as morning host, and later added Billy James as co-host. After John Boy accepted Jesus, he eventually decided he was being asked to play inappropriate songs, and he quit WBCY in February 1986. Bob Lacey, a veteran announcer for WBT and WBTV, replaced John Boy temporarily.Jeff Borden, \\"Bob Lacey to Replace John-Boy on Interim Basis,\\" The Charlotte Observer, February 13, 1986. Jim \\"Catfish\\" Prewitt also paired with Billy, who left the station in April.

WBCY was also the home of popular Contemporary Christian music program, \\"Visions\\", hosted by Ken Mayfield. The program aired every Sunday morning from 1985 until 1993 when Mayfield left to manage WRCM. When the North Carolina Tar Heels and the NBA Charlotte Hornets played at the same time, WBCY aired the Hornets.Jeff Borden, \\"Tar Heels Top Hornets in Battle for Air Time on WBT Radio,\\" The Charlotte Observer, p. 19A. In December 1988, Randy and Spiff were fired because WBCY intended to move toward \\"a more adult-oriented sound\\" under the new moniker \\"B108\\"; they became the morning hosts at WFOX in Atlanta.Jeff Borden, \\"Randy and Spiff Hit Atlanta,\\" The Charlotte Observer, January 21, 1989.Jeff Borden, \\"Country WSOC's Lead Grows,\\" The Charlotte Observer, January 28, 1989, p. 7B. The change also cost DJ J.J. McKay his job, so McKay went to work for WCKZ; WBCY sought to enforce a noncompete clause, but it was ruled the contract that included the clause had expired before McKay was let go.Jeff Borden, \\"WCKZ Wins in Dispute Over Deejay J.J.

That same month, WBCY returned to the WBT-FM call letters and changed its format to mainstream adult contemporary under the moniker \\"Sunny 107.9\\". Sheri Lynch joined Lacey in February 1992, forming the current \\"Bob & Sheri\\" show. Eventually, the station's music began leaning in a top 40 direction again. In 1995, Jefferson-Pilot purchased WBZK-FM, licensed to Chester, South Carolina, and flipped it to a simulcast of WBT to reach more listeners west of Charlotte at night due nighttime signal issues. As a result, the WBT-FM call letters went to that station,Tim Funk and David Poole, \\"Hornets Factor in Station Purchase,\\" The Charlotte Observer, February 2, 1995. while 107.9 FM became WWSN.Tim Funk, \\"WBTV's Bridges to Be Police's Community Education Coordinator,\\" The Charlotte Observer, August 30, 1995.

Stone's show later moved to weekends before the station ended it. Kelly McKay took over middays in 2009 and departed in 2014. Followed by Kelly Meyers in the Midday slot, she began in February 2015 and was let go in December of 2019. The Bob and Sheri Show is widely syndicated, heard on over 61 stations. Syndication of WLNK's programming is handled by Westwood One. In April 2006, Philadelphia-based Lincoln Financial Group acquired Jefferson- Pilot (including the broadcasting division, which was renamed Lincoln Financial Media). The WLNK callsign predates its previous owner and thus, similarities to the name \\"Lincoln\\" are coincidental. On November 12, 2007, as Lincoln Financial began to liquidate its broadcasting assets, Greater Media announced plans to acquire WLNK, along with sister stations WBT and WBT-FM, for $100 million,http://www.greatermedia.com/press/detail.php?ID=279, retrieved on 2008/05/15. a deal which was finalized on January 31, 2008. Starting with the 2015-16 season, WLNK aired any Tar Heels games that WBT couldn't air‚Äîfor instance, whenever the Carolina Panthers were airing on WBT. In July 2016, WLNK tweaked its format towards mainstream AC and changed their slogan to \\"Charlotte's Best Mix.\\" On July 19, 2016, Greater Media announced that they would merge with Beasley Media Group. Because Beasley is already maxed out in the Charlotte market with 5 FM's and 2 AM's, WLNK and WBT AM/FM were to be spun off to a divesture trust, eventually going to a permanent buyer. Beasley Acquires Greater Media On October 18, 2016, Entercom announced that they would purchase WLNK and WBT AM/FM, plus WFNZ, pending FCC approval. Entercom Acquires Beasley Charlotte Spinoffs Upon the completion of the Greater/Beasley merger on November 1, Entercom began operating the stations via a time brokerage agreement, which lasted until the sale was consummated on January 10, 2017.

Tucker is best remembered as a biographer of Joseph Stalin and as an analyst of the Soviet political system, which he saw as dynamic rather than unchanging. Biography Born in Kansas City, Missouri, he was a Sovietologist at Princeton University. He graduated from Harvard College, earning an A.B. magna cum laude in 1939, followed by an A.M. in 1941. He served as an attach√© at the American Embassy in Moscow from 1944‚Äì1953. He received his PhD degree from Harvard University in 1958; his doctoral dissertation was later revised and published as a book. His biographies of Joseph Stalin are cited by the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies as his greatest contribution. At Princeton he started the Russian Studies Program and held the position of Professor of Politics Emeritus and IBM Professor of International Studies Emeritus until he died. Tucker was a scholar of Russia and politics. His viewpoints were shaped by nine years (1944‚Äì1953) of diplomatic and translation work in wartime and postwar Russia (including persistent efforts to bring his Russian wife to the United States),Martin Douglas, \\"Robert C. Tucker, a Scholar of Marx, Stalin and Soviet Affairs, Dies at 92\\", The New York Times, August 1, 2010, p. A4. by wide-ranging interdisciplinary interests in the social sciences and humanities (notably history, psychology, and philosophy), and by creative initiatives to benefit from and contribute to comparative political studies (especially theories of political culture and leadership). Tucker married a Russian, Eugenia (Evgeniia) Pestretsova, who eventually emigrated with him and taught Russian for many years at Princeton. His daughter Elizabeth is a senior editor on the radio program Marketplace, American Public Media. Her husband, Tucker's son-in-law Robert English, is Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Southern California.  Basic ideas  Tucker's Harvard University doctoral dissertation was in philosophy and challenged the dominant interpretations of Soviet and Western theorists. He linked the ideas of the young and mature Karl Marx and emphasized their \\"moralist,\\" \\"ethical,\\" and \\"religious\\" rather than political, economic, and social \\"essence\\". His revised dissertation was published as Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx (1961) and was followed by a collection of innovative essays on Marxian theories of revolution, modernization, and distributive justice as well as comprehensive anthologies of the writings of Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin.Robert C. Tucker, Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1961); Robert C. Tucker, The Marxian Revolutionary Idea (New York: Norton, 1969); Robert C. Tucker, ed., The Marx-Engels Reader (New York: Norton, 1972); and Robert C. Tucker, ed., The Lenin Anthology (New York: Norton, 1975). Tucker presented lucidly formulated views on tsarist and Soviet politics. He affirmed that change in Soviet political leadership was even more important than continuity in Russian political culture. He contended that psychological differences were more important than ideological similarities in Soviet leadership politics and that Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, and Mikhail Gorbachev had very different personalities and mentalities.Robert C. Tucker, ed., The Soviet Political Mind (New York: Norton, rev. ed. 1971), ch. 9, 207 and 225. He emphasized that the different psychological make-ups of Russia's top political leaders invariably produced different perceptions of situations and options, which, in turn, periodically altered policymaking and implementation procedures as well as domestic and foreign policies. He argued that systemic changes came not only in October 1917, when the Bolsheviks seized power, and in December 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, but also in the mid-1930s, when Lenin's one-party dictatorship was transformed into Stalin's one-man dictatorship, and in the mid-1950s, when oligarchic one-party rule filled the power vacuum created by the dictator's death. He underscored that Soviet and post-Soviet Russia's political development progressed in distinctive stages, which were the products of leading officials' choices among viable options at key junctures. Tucker's main stages were: War Communism (1917‚Äì1921), New Economic Policy (1921‚Äì1928), Revolution from Above (1928‚Äì1937), Neo-Tsarist Autocracy (1937‚Äì1953), Thaw (1953‚Äì1964), Stagnation (1964‚Äì1985), and Perestroika (1985‚Äì1991).Many outstanding articles were reprinted in Robert C. Tucker, The Soviet Political Mind: Stalinism and Post-Stalin Change (New York: Norton, 1963, and rev. ed., 1971); and Robert C. Tucker, Political Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia: From Lenin to Gorbachev (New York: Norton, 1987). Stalinism While involuntarily remaining in Stalinist Russia, Tucker was greatly influenced by psychoanalytical theories of neurosis, paranoia, and self-idealization. He recognized such traits in Stalin and hypothesized that \\"psychological needs,\\" \\"psychopathological tendencies\\", and \\"politicized psychodynamics\\" were not only core elements of Stalin's \\"ruling personality\\", but also of Stalinism as a \\"system of rule\\" and Stalinization as the process of establishing that rule‚Äî\\"Neo-Tsarist Autocracy\\".Tucker, \\"The Dictator and Totalitarianism,\\" in The Soviet Political Mind, rev. ed., 30-32, 42; and Stalin in Power, 1-9 ff. > I hold that Stalinism must be recognized as an historically distinct and > specific phenomenon which did not flow directly from Leninism, although > Leninism was an important contributory factor. ... Stalinism, despite > conservative, reactionary, or counter-revolutionary elements in its makeup, > was a revolutionary phenomenon in essence; ... Stalinist revolution from > above, whatever the contingencies involved in its inception and pattern, was > an integral phase of the Russian revolutionary process as a whole; ... > notable among the causal factors explaining why the Stalinist revolution > occurred, or why it took the form it did, are the heritage of Bolshevik > revolutionism, the heritage of old Russia, and the mind and personality of > Stalin.Tucker, \\"Stalinism as Revolution from Above,\\" in Robert C.

These themes were developed from comparative, theoretical, and interdisciplinary perspectives and were documented at length in Tucker's magnum opus, the two published volumes of an unfinished three-volume biography of Stalin, and in other important works on Stalin and Stalinism.Robert C.

Tucker rejected the view that Stalinism was an \\"unavoidable,\\" \\"ineluctable,\\" or \\"necessary\\" product of Leninism. He highlighted the similarities between tsarist and Stalinist nationalism and patrimonialism, as well as the warlike brutality of the \\"Revolution from Above\\" in the 1930s. The chief causes of this revolution were Stalin's voracious appetite for personal, political, and national power and his relentless quest for personal, political, and national security. The chief consequences were the consolidation of Stalin's personal dictatorship, the creation of a military-industrial complex, and the collectivization and urbanization of the peasantry. And the chief means of achieving these ends included blood purges of party and state elites, centralized economic management and slave labor camps, and genocidal famine in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.Tucker, \\"Swollen State, Spent Society: Stalin's Legacy to Brezhnev's Russia\\", in Political Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia, 116 ff.; and in Erik P. Hoffmann and Robbin F. Laird, eds., The Soviet Polity in the Modern Era (Hawthorne, NY: Aldine Publishing Co., 1984), 48 ff. Stalin's irrational premonitions, trepidations, and aggressions‚Äîintermixed with his rational perceptions, predispositions, and calculations‚Äîdecisively influenced Soviet domestic politics and foreign policies during and after World War II. Of particular significance were Stalin's forced resettlement of entire non-Russian nationality groups, skillful negotiations with wartime allies, atomic espionage, reimposition of harsh controls in postwar Russia, imposition of Soviet rule in Eastern Europe, and Cold War military-industrial, geopolitical, and ideological rivalry with the United States.John Lewis Gaddis, \\"The Cold War: A New History\\" (London: Penguin, 2007), 8-14. De- Stalinization When Stalin died in 1953, Tucker experienced \\"intense elation\\" for personal and political reasons.Robert C. Tucker, \\"Memoir of a Stalin Biographer\\", The International Karen Horney Society, 6 (last updated June 18, 2002) His wife, Evgenia Pestretsova, was soon granted a visa to the United States (and his mother-in-law joined them a half-decade later after a face-to-face request to Khrushchev). Tucker saw a gradually, albeit fitfully, liberalizing Soviet polity, economy, and society and an improving Soviet- American relations (with prospects for much less conflict and much more cooperation). For Tucker, Stalin's demise posed the question \\"What shall take the place of Stalinism as a mode of rule and pattern of policy and ideas\\"? The central issues in Soviet politics were the \\"desirability, forms, limits, and tempo\\" of de-Stalinization.Tucker, \\"The Politics of Soviet De-Stalinization,\\" in The Soviet Political Mind, rev. ed., 199. As Tucker detailed in The Soviet Political Mind (1963 and 1971, rev. ed.) and Political Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia (1987), Stalin's successors did not consensually craft a post-Stalinist political system. An oligarchic system emerged as the byproduct of struggle over power and policy among reformist and conservative party and state leaders, whose factions and coalitions increasingly sought the support of subnational party and state officials. Forswearing the use of violence to resolve intraparty disputes and outmaneuvering rivals in bureaucratic infighting, Khrushchev revitalized the party and reasserted its leading role vis-√†-vis the state bureaucracies. But his international and domestic \\"hare- brained schemes\\"‚Äîabove all, the Cuban Missile Crisis‚Äîled to his ouster by Brezhnev's \\"collective leadership\\", whose costly and prolonged military buildup helped to produce (in Tucker's apt words) \\"a swollen state\\" and \\"a spent society\\".Tucker, Robert C., \\"Swollen State, Spent Society,\\" in Political Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia, 108-139; and in Hoffmann and Laird, eds., The Soviet Polity in the Modern Era, 41-67. Gorbachev made glasnost, perestroika, and democratization the centerpieces of a revolutionary ideology, which sparked a divisive public debate about the political content and policy implications of these concepts. More revolutionary, in the late 1980s, Gorbachev discarded the \\"Brezhnev doctrine\\", withdrawing Soviet troops from Afghanistan and allowing East European countries in the Soviet bloc to choose their own types of political system. And, most revolutionary, from late 1990 to late 1991, Gorbachev unintentionally and Boris Yeltsin intentionally spurred the disintegration of the Soviet Union, enabling the fifteen union republics to develop their own types of nation-state. Gorbachev at the time was the indirectly elected president of the Soviet Union, and Yeltsin was the directly elected president of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic,Charles E. Ziegler, \\"The History of Russia\\", 146 by far the largest and most important union republic. The rivalry between Gorbachev and Yeltsin unequivocally confirmed Tucker's contention that the personalities and mentalities of top Soviet leaders could clash viscerally and vindictively. Tucker had long insisted that intraparty conflict was a catalyst of change in both Soviet policymaking procedures and substantive policies. He observed in 1957: \\"Probably the most important single failing of Soviet studies in the West has been a general tendency to take pretty much at face value the Communist pretension to a 'monolithic' system of politics. ... Not monolithic unity but the fiction of it prevails in Soviet politics. The ruling party has rarely if ever been the disciplined phalanx pictured by its image-makers, and Lenin's well-known Resolution on Party Unity of 1921 has largely been honored in the breach\\".Tucker, \\"The Politics of Soviet De-Stalinization,\\" in The Soviet Political Mind, rev. ed., 197 (italics in original). Tucker was keenly aware that Soviet ideology could divide or unify leading party officials and could weaken or strengthen party discipline.Robert V. Daniels, The Rise and Fall of Communism in Russia (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007), 390-99. During the Gorbachev years, a reformist official ideology clashed with a conservative operational ideology, and this conflict fractured the party. In 1987, Tucker affirmed: '\\"Marxism-Leninism' is not at present a rigidly defined set of dogma that allows no scope for differences of interpretation on matters of importance, as it was earlier on. Gorbachev is propounding his own version of it while recognizing‚Äîand deploring‚Äîthat far from all his party comrades share it\\".Tucker, \\"Conclusion\\" (205) and \\"To Change a Political Culture: Gorbachev and the Fight for Soviet Reform\\" (140-98) in Political Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia. Indeed, freer expression of aspirations and grievances destabilized as well as de-Stalinized state-society relations and disintegrated as well as democratized the Soviet polity and society. \\"Dual Russia\\" Spotlighting an important element of cultural continuity, Tucker coined the concept of \\"dual Russia\\". This concept focuses attention on the psychological rift between the Russian state and society and on the \\"we-they\\" mentality of Russia's coercive elites and coerced masses.Tucker, \\"The Image of Dual Russia,\\" in The Soviet Political Mind, rev. ed., 122 (italics in original). \\"The relation between the state and the society is seen as one between conqueror and conquered\\". Tucker stressed that this \\"evaluative attitude\\" was embraced and reinforced by the most violent and impatient state- building and social-engineering tsars, especially Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great. Tucker also stressed that Alexander II tried to narrow the gulf between the \\"two Russias\\", but his \\"liberalizing reform from above coincided with the rise of an organized revolutionary movement from below\\".Tucker, \\"The Image of Dual Russia,\\" pg. 125. Indeed, expectations and assessments of \\"dual Russia\\" seem to have greatly influenced the decisions and actions of tsars and commissars, revolutionaries and bureaucrats, and ordinary citizens of Russian and non-Russian ethnicity. Tucker underscored that most tsars and tsarist officials viewed state-society relations as hostile, and that most of the huge serf peasantry, small urban proletariat, and tiny educated stratum had similarly hostile views. But Tucker did not observe a stable or complementary relationship between authoritarian Russian elites and obeisant Russian masses. Instead, he saw mounting pressures from social units and networks for an \\"unbinding\\" of the state's control of society. Tucker's illiterate serf and literate proletarian view the tsarist state as \\"an abstract entity\\" and \\"an alien power\\".Tucker, \\"The Image of Dual Russia,\\" pp. 122-125. (italics added). His collective farmer resents enserfment and his factory worker resents exploitation in Stalin's \\"socialist\\" revolution. And his post-Stalin democratic dissident and liberal intellectual actively and passively reject \\"dual Russia\\". Tucker used the concept of \\"dual Russia\\" to elucidate a very important component of de-Stalinization: > The [Khrushchev] regime, it would appear, looks to a rise in the material > standard of consumption as a means of reconciling the Russian people to > unfreedom in perpetuity. But it is doubtful that a policy of reform > operating within these narrow limits can repair the rupture between the > state and society that is reflected in the revival of the image of a dual > Russia. A moral renovation of the national life, a fundamental reordering of > relations, a process of genuine \\"unbinding,\\" or, in other words, an > alternation in the nature of the system, would be needed.Tucker, \\"The Image > of Dual Russia,\\" pg. 141. (italics added). In short, Tucker viewed \\"dual Russia\\" as a core element of the tsarist, Soviet, and post-Soviet political systems, and he affirmed that systemic change must be founded on spiritual healing of state-society relations. Political culture Tucker distinguished between \\"real\\" and \\"ideal\\" culture and between \\"macro-level\\" and \\"micro-level\\" culture. \\"Real\\" cultural patterns consist of \\"prevalent practices in a society\\"; \\"ideal\\" patterns consist of \\"accepted norms, values, and beliefs\\". A \\"macro-level\\" culture is a society's \\"complex totality of patterns and sub-patterns\\" of traditions and orientations; \\"micro-level\\" cultural elements are \\"individual patterns and clusters of them\\". Cultural patterns are \\"ingrained by custom in the conduct and thoughtways of large numbers of people\\". More like an anthropologist than a political scientist, Tucker included behavior as well as values, attitudes, and beliefs in his concept of culture.Robert C. Tucker, \\"Sovietology and Russian History,\\" Post-Soviet Affairs, 8, 3 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1992), 190-191 (italics added). Tucker affirmed that \\"a strength of the concept of political culture as an analytic tool (in comparison with such macro concepts as modernization and development) is its micro/macro [and real/ideal] character\\". He studied these four characteristics individually and in various juxtapositions, configurations, and interactions. And he hypothesized that different components of political culture \\"can have differing fates in times of radical change\\", especially in revolutionary transitions from one type of political system to another and from one stage of political development to another.Tucker, \\"Sovietology and Russian History,\\" pg. 191. Tucker corroborated this hypothesis with evidence from the Soviet Union. In 1987, he affirmed: \\"The pattern of thinking one thing in private and being conformist in public will not vanish or radically change simply because glasnost has come into currency as a watchword of policy. Changing the pattern will take time and effort and, above all, some risk-taking openness in action by citizens who speak up ... [and] forsake the pattern of pretence which for so long has governed public life in their country.\\"Tucker, \\"Sovietology and Russian History,\\" pp. 190-193; and Tucker, \\"Gorbachev and the Fight for Soviet Reform\\", in Political Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia, 184-185 (italics in original). In 1993, he elaborated: \\"Although communism as a belief system ... is dying out [in post-Soviet Russia], very many of the real culture patterns of the Soviet period, including that very \\"'bureaucratism' that made a comeback after the revolutionary break in 1917, are still tenaciously holding on.\\"Robert C. Tucker, \\"Foreword,\\" in Frederic J. Fleron, Jr., and Erik P. Hoffmann, eds., Post-Communist Studies and Political Science: Methodology and Empirical Theory in Sovietology (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1993), xi- xii. And, in 1995, he added: \\"The banning of the CPSU, the elimination of communism as a state creed, and the breakup of the USSR as an imperial formation marked in a deep sense the ending of the Soviet era. But in part because of the abruptness with which these events came about, much of the statist Soviet system and political culture survived into the 1990s.\\"Robert C. Tucker, \\"Post-Soviet Leadership and Change\\", in Timothy J. Colton and Robert C. Tucker, eds., Patterns in Post-Soviet Leadership (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1995), 9, 26. As Tucker saw it, the \\"ideal\\" and \\"macro\\" political cultures of the Communist party collapsed with the Soviet Union, but the \\"real\\" and \\"micro\\" political cultures of tsarist and Soviet Russia adapted to the emerging governmental, commercial, legal, and moral cultures of post- Soviet Russia. He underscored the impact of tsarist political culture on Soviet political culture and, in turn, their combined impact on post-Soviet political culture. Tucker was not a historical determinist, but he observed that centuries-old statism was alive and well in Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Authoritarian political systems Tucker coined the concept of \\"the revolutionary mass-movement regime under single-party auspices,\\" which he viewed as a general type of authoritarian regime with communist, fascist, and nationalist variants. Tucker's purpose was to stimulate both cross-national and cross-temporal comparisons of authoritarian political systems and social movements. He hypothesized that Soviet Russian history is \\"one of different movements and of different Soviet regimes within a framework of continuity of organizational forms and official nomenclature\\".Tucker, \\"On Revolutionary Mass-Movement Regimes\\", in The Soviet Political Mind, rev. ed., 7, 16, 18 (italics in original). On Stalin's personality, see also chapters 2-5. Noteworthy is Tucker's emphasis on the top Soviet leader's mental health and its ramifications for political change and continuity. The psychological or psychopathological needs and wants of a movement-regime's leader are \\"the driving force of the political mechanism,\\" and the movement-regime is \\"a highly complicated instrumentality\\" for expressing the leader's primal emotions in political behavior. Stalin's self- glorification, lust for power, megalomania, paranoia, and cruelty are viewed as integral components of Stalinist \\"real culture,\\" operative ideology, \\"dictatorial decisionmaking\\", domestic and foreign policies, policy implementation and resistance, and state penetration and domination of society. Tucker sought not only to describe and document Stalin's motives and beliefs, but also to explain their psychological origins, interactive development, and tangible consequences for Stalin individually and for Stalinist rule. Tucker's focus on the diverse mind-sets and skill-sets of Soviet leaders supported his early critique of the totalitarian model, which he faulted for paying insufficient attention to the institutionalized pathologies and idiosyncrasies of autocrats and oligarchs. Tucker also criticized the totalitarian model for downplaying the conflicts and cleavages, inefficiencies and incompatibilities, and \\"departmentalism\\" and \\"localism\\" in purportedly \\"monolithic\\" and \\"monopolistic\\" regimes. As he noted, an autocrat's top lieutenants often were bitter rivals, rank-and-file party officials often withheld negative information from their superiors, and \\"family groups\\" or \\"clans\\" often resisted state controls in informal and ingenious ways. Having lived and worked in Stalin's Russia for nine years, Tucker had rich experiential knowledge and instinctive comprehension of everyday life in the USSR, which included family, friends, favors, work, and bureaucracy as well as fear, deprivation, persecution, surveillance, and hypocrisy. He could feel as well as analyze the similarities and differences between the realities and ideals of Soviet totalitarianism. And, because the totalitarian model was the dominant cross-national component of Sovietology, Tucker called for more and better comparative analysis of Soviet politics and for mutually beneficial ties with mainstream political science. He rejected the \\"theoretical isolationism\\" of Sovietology and its widely held presupposition that Soviet politics was \\"a unique subject matter\\". Political leadership Tucker practiced what he preached. Not only did he compare Soviet and tsarist Russian political leaders, but he also compared various types of political leadership in various contexts. In Politics as Leadership (1981), he argued that leadership is \\"the essence of politics\\". He analyzed the diagnostic, prescriptive, and mobilizing functions of leadership. He surveyed \\"the process of political leadership,\\" \\"leadership through social movements,\\" and \\"leadership and the human situation\\". He underscored that a leader's definition of a situation could be self-fulfilling and must be communicated effectively to different audiences. And he elaborated on the key sociopsychological maxim that \\"situations defined as real are real in their consequences\\": > The political process is influenced by many a material factor, but it has > its prime locus in the mind. Not only is it a mental process when leaders > learn about and analyze the causes of circumstances that have arisen, when > they interpret the circumstances' meaning in relation to various concerns, > when they define the problem situation for their political communities and > decide on what seems the proper prescription for collective action. Mental > processes are also pivotally involved‚Äînow in the minds of followers or > potential followers‚Äîwhen leadership appeals for positive response to its > policy prescription.Robert C. Tucker, Politics as Leadership (Columbia, MO: > University of Missouri Press, 1981, rev. ed., 1995), 17-19, 59, 113-114, > quotes at 17 and 59 of rev. ed. On the linkages between political leadership > and political culture, see also Tucker, Political Culture and Leadership in > Soviet Russia; and Tucker's two chapters in Colton and Tucker, eds., > Patterns in Post-Soviet Leadership, 5-28, 235-240. Tucker sharply contrasted constitutional and nonconstitutional states, especially their respective political cultures and leadership prerogatives: > What distinguishes constitutional forms of statehood ... is that no one, be > it a ruling person, a government in power or a ruling party, may act on the > principle L'Etat, c'est moi [I am the state]. For the state is the body of > citizens, together with the collectively self-accepted system of laws by > which they are governed and which center in the constitution. ... The result > is a disjunction between loyalty to the state and agreement with the > policies of a particular government in power or acceptance of that > government as a desirable one for the nation. ... That, it seems, is the > essence of constitutionalism as a political culture; open plurality of > political groups or parties is an institutional derivative of this > disjunction. Where constitutionalism does not exist, even though a > constitutional charter may have been formally proclaimed, the authorities > treat disagreement with the given government's or ruling party's policies, > or disapproval of the government itself, as disloyalty to the state. In > effect, they say: L'Etat, c'est nous [We are the state].Tucker, Political > Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia, 201-202 (italics in original). Briefly stated, Tucker stressed the importance of political leadership. He contended that the psychological characteristics of autocrats varied greatly, as did their personal and policy priorities and their policymaking and administrative capabilities. He affirmed that oligarchs perceived opportunities and liabilities in diverse ways and often struggled over power and policy, especially at historical turning points with viable options. An avid scholar of Russian history, Tucker scrutinized the interaction between the tsarist autocracy and the revolutionary movement. He emphasized the Russian rather than the Marxian roots of Bolshevism. He highlighted the differences between Lenin's one-party dictatorship and Stalin's one-man dictatorship. He illuminated the similarities between tsarist and Stalinist state-building and social engineering. He elucidated the domestic and international politics of de-Stalinization in Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. And he argued that the animosities, anxieties, and incompatibilities of the \\"two Russias\\" weakened the legitimacy, efficacy, and stability of tsarist, communist, and post-communist regimes. Communist studies and the social sciences What younger generations of comparativists in political science may not know is that Tucker was at the forefront of efforts to bring the comparative study of communist systems into the discipline of political science and the field of comparative politics. In 1969, he assumed chairmanship of the Planning Group on Comparative Communist Studies sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies under a grant from the Carnegie Corporation. During his six-year tenure as chair, the Planning Group convened a number of international conferences that shed new light on the similarities and differences among communist regimes. The proceedings of these conferences were reported to the profession through the publication of several conference volumes.Frederic J. Fleron, Jr., \\"The Planning Group on Comparative Communist Studies: A Report to the Profession\\", Conference on Communist Studies, Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, San Francisco, September, 1975. Frederic J. Fleron, Jr., Conference Report, \\"Technology and Communist Culture: Bellagio, Italy, August 22‚Äì28, 1975,\\" Technology and Culture (The International Quarterly of the Society for the History of Technology), XVIII, 4 (October, 1977), 659-665. Tucker's tenure as chair also saw the expansion of the Planning Group's Newsletter on Comparative Studies of Communism, which presented shorter discussion pieces on the subject of its masthead.Edited by Frederic J. Fleron, Jr., from 1970-1975 at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The intellectual tone for much of the work of the Planning Group under Tucker's leadership was set by his paper \\"Culture, Political Culture, and Soviet Studies,\\" written for a 1971 conference on Communist Political Culture convened at Arden House in Harriman, New York. Subsequently, published in Political Science Quarterly (1973) and as the opening chapter in his book Political Culture and Leadership in Soviet Russia (1987), that paper set forth the hypothesis that \\"if Communism in practice tends to be an amalgam of an innovated cultural system [Marxism] and elements of a national cultural ethos, then divergences of national cultural ethos will be one of the factors making for developmental diversity and cultural tension between different [Marxist] movements\\". Subsequent conferences of the Planning Group explored the extent of those divergences and developmental diversities, including a third element in the amalgam that Tucker had overlooked‚Äîcomponents of imported foreign culture, including technology‚Äîbut to which he was quite receptive. Although perhaps best known for his seminal trilogy on Stalin (the third volume of which remained unfinished at the time of his death), the corpus of Tucker's scholarly work was significant, among other reasons, for moving communism studies and particularly Soviet studies away from narrow area studies and helping to place them within the parameters of political science and the social sciences. His desire to move Soviet studies in that direction can be found in one of his earliest works‚Äîon the first page of an article entitled \\"Towards a Comparative Politics of Movement Regimes,\\" published in The American Political Science Review (1961). This article was reprinted in an important collection of Tucker's early essays‚ÄîThe Soviet Political Mind (1963; rev. ed. 1971) ‚Äî that included such important essays as \\"The Image of Dual Russia\\" ‚Äî a classic piece that is still assigned in graduate and undergraduate courses on Soviet and Russian politics. Tucker's highly regarded work on Stalin drew on the theories of psychologist Karen Horney, providing insights into the feared (and still revered by some in Russia) Soviet leader and demonstrating the significance of psychological theories for understanding political leadership. Rather than merely describing Stalin's cruelty, paranoia, and mental quirks, Tucker was more concerned with explaining Stalin's psychological make-up. And that is where Horney's theories proved invaluable to him. He found in Horney's work the study of \\"neurotic character structure,\\" which included such attributes as the \\"search for glory\\" and a \\"need for vindictive triumph\\".Robert C. Tucker, \\"Memoir of a Stalin Biographer,\\" International Karen Horney Society (last updated, June 18, 2002), 1. It was Horney's 1950 book Neurosis and Human Growth that particularly inspired him while serving on the staff of the American Embassy in Moscow at the time. A half century later, he was quite candid in acknowledging the role of that work in the development of his own thinking: \\"Instead of dealing in such abstract categories from a book of psychology, I was now using that book as guidance in a biographer's effort to portray his subject as an individual\\".Tucker, \\"Memoir of a Stalin Biographer,\\" pg. 6. Notwithstanding his \\"intellectual fascination with [Horney's] unusual hypothesis,\\" Tucker in the end confessed that his biography of Stalin \\"never became ‚Äîfortunately‚Äî the political-science tract that it started out to be\\".Tucker, \\"Memoir of a Stalin Biographer,\\" pg. 6 (italics added). He was quick to add, however, that \\"neither did it become a conventional biography of a historically influential person\\". While this may indicate growing frustration at his own attempts to marry Soviet studies and the social sciences, he nevertheless remained sympathetic to and supportive of such attempts by his own students and colleagues. Tucker's interest in political leadership was by no means confined to Stalin. Indeed, he addressed the subject of political leadership in a much broader context in his 1981 book Politics as Leadership, in which he viewed politics as leadership rather than as power. Such an approach, Tucker argued, was more useful to students of society, since it was more comprehensive and could open up more areas to political analysis than could the more orthodox view of politics as power. In his preface to the 1995 revised edition of the book, Tucker restated two fundamental propositions that had guided his inquiries into political leadership: (1) \\"political leadership often makes a crucial difference in the lives of states and other human communities\\"; and (2) \\"leadership‚Äîalthough the term itself has a positive resonance‚Äîcan be a malignant force in human affairs as well as a force for good.\\"Tucker, Politics as Leadership, rev. ed., xi. His collected works clearly demonstrated the veracity of both propositions. Intellectual impact Tucker was a leading and pioneering scholar and educator. He led by personal example‚Äîhis values and character‚Äîand by professional example‚Äîhis creativity and productivity. He addressed issues of fundamental importance to the social sciences and humanities. He explored linkages between political science and Russian studies. He buttressed independent-minded and open-minded viewpoints with cogent reasoning, empathic understanding, illuminating cases, and fresh evidence. As a member of the political science faculties at Indiana University (1958‚Äì1961) and Princeton University (1962‚Äì1984), Tucker profoundly influenced students and colleagues. Many expressed their gratitude at a 1988 Princeton conference and banquet in his honor on the occasion of his seventieth birthday and at a 2010 Princeton chapel service of remembrance and celebration after his death at age 92.

It was established by Georges de Latour and his wife Fernande in 1900. History The estate architecture featured in its wine label Initially a purchase of of land in 1900, Beaulieu Vineyard derives its name from the French phrase \\"Quel beau lieu\\" which translates to English as \\"What a beautiful place\\". Legend has it that Fernande uttered these words when she first saw the land. The following year (not according to this timeline: https://www.bvwines.com/heritage, they purchased a nearby winery originally built by California State Senator Seneca Ewer in 1885. De Latour's knowledge about phylloxera which had ravaged many Napa Valley vineyard, and his decision to import a rootstock variety resistant to the pest helped secure his stature as one of the early pioneers of California's wine industry. Signet Collection Series Clone 6, 100% Cabernet Sauvignon 2000 A cork of BV When Prohibition in the United States began in 1920, most wineries in the country were forced out of operation. However, Beaulieu obtained a contract to supply sacramental wine to churches nationwide. The demand for such wine increased dramatically during the years of Prohibition and the winery repeatedly expanded. By the Repeal of Prohibition in 1933, production had grown to over per year. Following Repeal of Prohibition, Beaulieu hired Andre Tchelistcheff from France as winemaker and the quality of its wines increased significantly. Tchelistcheff also became a mentor to other important winemakers such as Mike Grgich (whose Chateau Montelena Chardonnay won the Judgment of Paris), Joe Heitz of Heitz Wine Cellars, and Robert Mondavi. By the 1940s, Beaulieu wines were served at all major White House functions. In the mid-1940s, Beaulieu was owned by Marquis de Pins, whose wife was a member of the French wine-making de Latour family. This was noted in Life Magazine in an article on the debut ball at which their daughter was a debutante. In the 1950s and 1960s Beaulieu was considered one of the \\"big four\\" Napa Valley producers, along with Inglenook (also in Rutherford), Charles Krug, and Louis Martini. In the Ottawa Wine Tasting of 1981, the 1970 vintage of Beaulieu Vineyard George de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon received second place. The winery was purchased by international conglomerate Heublein Inc., in 1969. Heublein was later acquired by RJR Nabisco, then sold to Grand Metropolitan in 1987. Grand Metropolitan became Diageo plc in 1997 through a merger with Guinness, and is now the largest multinational beer, wine and spirits company in the world. In 2016 Diageo sold Beaulieu Vineyard to Treasury Wine Estates.

Sometimes classified in the family Emberizidae, more recent studies have shown it to belongs in the tanager family, Thraupidae. It is endemic to Cocos Island, which is approximately south of Costa Rica. It is a chunky 12 cm long finch, weighing around 12.5 g and with a black decurved pointed bill. The male is entirely black, while the female is a heavily streaked brown, with a paler underside. The young are similar but have yellow bills. The standard clutch is two brown-spotted white eggs, which are hatched in a roughly spherical nest built at the end of a tree branch.  Taxonomy  The species name of the Cocos finch, Inornata , meaning plain or unadorned in Latin, was coined by Augustus Addison Gould in 1843. The genus of the Cocos finch would later be verified by Richard Bowlder Sharpe in 1885. The Cocos finch was originally placed in the family Emperizidae but recent phylogenic studies shows that diversification of the Cocos finch originates in the family Thraupidae. The Cocos finch was first categorized to be closer to the warbler finch clade due to the similar morphology of cousin warbler finches. Although, there has been evidence claiming that the Cocos finch belongs closer to the tree finches due to its phylogenic studies via mtDNA sequence matching closely to related birds of the tree finch clade. The Cocos finch shares many morphological similarities to other Darwin's finches despite having been separated from the Galapagos Islands. What is unique, however, of the Cocos finch, is that they display an inter-species variation in feeding habits. The variation in foraging behaviors are hypothesized to be possible by observational learning from other Cocos finches. These feeding specializations are independent of any morphological changes, sex and age differences, rather, they are derived from an inter-species variation found within the Cocos finch. Still, despite its variation in feeding patterns, Cocos finches are categorized as one species with no known subspecies.  Description  The Cocos finch stands at about 12 cm long weighing in at about 12.5 g. The bird has a small pointed beak for eating berries and insects that are its main diet. They are sexually dimorphic in that the males have black feathers from the tail, breast, nape, and crown. Unlike male finches found in Galapagos island, male Cocos finches have black beaks year-round. Female Cocos finch have a lighter brown complexion compared to a male Cocos finch. There is a black splattering of feathers on their breast area down to the flank and rump. The belly of the female Cocos finch is milky white compared to the mantle of the bird. The nape and crown area are more noticeably black. The call of a Cocos finch can be described as a \\"buzzy\\" like sound with a high- pitched ending note. The beginning of the call can form a ‚Äúdjirr‚Äù sound followed by a high pitched ‚Äútiew‚Äù sound. Calls can also include a high pitched ‚Äúphzzzz‚Äù sound.  Distribution and Habitat  Cocos Island viewed from a helicopter The Cocos finch is exclusively found in Cocos Island (1,997 km2 area), 580 km SE from Costa Rica. Cocos finches are not known to have traveled outside of Cocos Island making its habitat and reproduction range to only be at 30 km2 within the island. The habitat of the Cocos finch is mostly within Hibiscus thickets, closed-canopy forest and woodland forest. The climate within Cocos Island is described to be a typical rain forest climate with high humidity and chances for rainfall. The island has a varied landscape with bodies of lakes, streams, and caves and is home to other species including endemic lizards (only 2 species), small mice, small cats, and some migratory birds.  Ecology and Behavior = Foraging Patterns  Cocos finches known to be a generalist species, although they are also known to specialize in an individual level which can result in different foraging behaviors within individual Cocos finches. This specialized behavior of Cocos finches can be explained through learning foraging patterns through other Cocos finches and can resonate said individual behavior to other Cocos Finches.  Breeding  Cocos finch usually nest throughout the year; however, their breeding season falls usually at around January‚ÄìFebruary. They form a nest using lichen and dry moss as their main material. Eggs are in clutch sizes of about 4‚Äì5 with a distinctive pink/light brown spots.  Threats  Cocos finches face mammalian predatory encounters including native and introduced rats and cats in the island. Despite its predators, there is no evidence of high predatory pressures on the Cocos finches themselves. Scientists conclude that due to the low predatory pressures on Cocos finches, they have developed this specialized feeding behavior to evolve to a more generalist species.  Status  Cocos Island is a natural reserved island and that there is limited human interaction towards the Cocos finch and to other Cocos Island inhabitants. While there has been increasing tourism around the island, there is no evidence of high disturbance rates from these tourists to affect the wildlife in the island including the Cocos Finch. While the predation and disturbance rate of Cocos finch are low along with a steady population rate, the IUCN deems the Cocos finch to be vulnerable due to the small habitat it occupies; about 30 km2 of the whole Cocos Island. As of now, there are about 6,000-15,000 Cocos Finches living isolated in Cocos Island.

The main building is Kulas Hall. The Conservatory is home to the Baldwin Wallace Bach Festival, the oldest collegiate Bach Festival in the United States. The nationally renowned Music Theatre program, directed by Victoria Bussert, draws hundreds of auditioners each year. The instrumental programs have produced extremely successful musicians; several BW alumni presently play with the Cleveland Orchestra. History Today's Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music was established during the Baldwin Institute's existence. At the time, the undergraduate-only conservatory was founded in 1898 by Dr. Albert Riemenschneider. Before this time, music classes were offered at the Baldwin Institute for one dollar extra per term. In 1912, land donated by the citizens of Berea was used to expand the institution and improve the facilities for music. The Kulas Musical Arts Building was constructed, housing a $25,000 pipe organ. In 1913 the Conservatory expanded into an adjacent residence hall (Merner-Pfeiffer Hall) and an enclosed bridge was constructed connecting the two buildings. This building was then renovated in 1939. In 2009, the Berea First Congregational Church became part of the college. Then in 2011 an expansion was done to connect the Kulas Musical Arts Building with the Berea First Congregational Church. The Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music is home to the BW Bach Festival, the oldest collegiate Bach festival in the nation, as well as the second-oldest Bach festival in the nation. The festival was founded in 1932 by Professor Albert Riemenschneider (longtime Director of the College Conservatory) and his wife, Selma. The then Baldwin-Wallace Festival Choir and Orchestra presented the first Bach Festival in June 1933 and has continued on an annual basis ever since. In 2007, the nation's oldest Bach Festival, The Bethlehem, and Baldwin Wallace performed together for BW's 75th anniversary of the festival. These two groups have worked together to celebrate the milestones of their festivals. The Bethlehem (Pennsylvania) choir was founded in 1898 by J. Fred Wolle. Riemenschneider, founder of the BW festival, was inspired by a 1931 trip to the Bethlehem Bach Festival. In 2012, internationally heiled Bach scholar Ton Koopman worked with the Conservatory's Motet choir. Facilities The BBCCM Annex prior to renovation Merner-Pfeiffer Hall opened in 1913 Boesel Musical Center opened in 2011 Kulas Hall opened in 1912 The main conservatory buildings include Kulas Musical Arts Building, Merner-Pfeiffer Hall and Boesel Musical Arts Center. The Boesel Musical Arts Center opened in 2011. In the Conservatory's beginnings, Kulas Musical Arts Building was the sole home of the music students, with Merner-Pfeiffer Hall being a very close dormitory in proximity. Eventually, Merner-Pfeiffer was renovated and became a part of the Conservatory buildings. Kohler Hall, a nearby building, houses many conservatory students. Having outgrown its existing facilities in the early 2000s, the Conservatory embarked on a second expansion and renovation project, and in August 2008 acquired the adjacent First Congregational United Church of Christ building. This building was renovated to house conservatory programs and attached to Merner-Pfeiffer Hall via a new connecting structure. The connecting structure and what used to be the United Church of Christ were named Boesel Musical Arts Center. The Ferne Patterson Jones Music Library is located in the basement of Merner-Pfeiffer Hall. The library contains nearly 40,000 items, including approximately 13,000 volumes of printed music. The Riemenschneider Bach Institute, located in the Boesel Musical Arts Center, holds a priceless collection of rare materials related to J. S. Bach and his circle. The Riemenschneider Bach Library, a unique collection of Bach-oriented books, manuscripts, archival materials, and scores, includes rare items such as the Emmy Martin Collection of first-edition scores; the Riemenschneider Graduate Library Collection; the Hans T. David Collection of books, manuscripts, archival items, and scores (including a number of first-edition scores); the opera-oriented Tom Villella collection of phonodiscs, books, archival materials, and memorabilia and the Albert and Helen Borowitz Recording Collection (2007). The library also holds a collection of Cleveland Orchestra programs (1902-1974). Currently, the total Bach Institute \\"volume count\\" exceeds the 20,000 mark. The Institute also publishes BACH: Journal of the Riemenschneider Bach Institute, a scholarly journal, and serves as the research arm of the Baldwin Wallace Bach Festival.

As well, the festival carries the title of the second oldest Bach festival in America. The festival was founded in 1932 by music educator Albert Riemenschneider and his wife, Selma. The festival rotates Bach's four major works ~ the B-minor Mass, the St. John Passion, the St. Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio ~ every four years in sequence. Since the inception of the Festival, Baldwin Wallace's vocal and instrumental students perform the major choral and orchestral works with a cast of internationally renowned vocal soloists, faculty and local professionals. Today, the program has become a three-day, multi-event. Music Theatre In recent years, BW conservatory of music has become nationally recognized for its top tier musical theatre program. Under the direction of Victoria Bussert, the program has been recognized by many in the theatrical community as one of the best college education programs for musical theatre in the country, amongst the ranks of other elite programs such as the University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon University. The annual senior showcase in New York City has ended with every senior receiving representation from various talent agencies for the past ten years. Victoria Bussert is the director of musical theatre, Scott Plate is the department chair, Greg Daniels is the head of the dance department, and Beth Burrier and Matthew Webb are the music directors. Rent and La Boh√®me in Repertory Rent was performed in the spring of 2011. The conservatory presented the Puccini and Larson works in repertory, for the first time in the world, in February 2011, with nearly 80 students from the music theater and voice departments. Some singers performed in both productions. Sharing the same set, \\"La Boheme,\\" updated to the 1930s, had six performances during the run Feb. 15-27, 2011, at BW's John Patrick Theatre, while \\"Rent\\" had ten performances. Phantom of the Opera In 2007, Baldwin Wallace was selected to perform one of six pre-release pilot productions of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera. The running had 12 performances, with a cast of more than 50. The production featured a 35-piece orchestra and a production staff of nearly 100 students. The performances drew over 6,000 playgoers, averaging about 500 audience members per show. > While there are no plans at this time to release Phantom to the stock and > amateur market, we want to be fully prepared for when that great day > arrives.

The Beatles Festival During each spring since 2011, students from Baldwin Wallace have performed an entire album recorded by The Beatles, complete with full orchestrations. This ensemble features a unique collection of performers drawing from all majors in the Conservatory. In a nod to the school's Bach Festival, The Beatles Festival rotates four of group's greatest works: Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, and The White Album. Alumni & Faculty :for a List of renowned BW Conservatory alumni, see List of BW Conservatory Alumni The Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music is renowned for its accomplished and respected staff. Several of the staff members are full-time Cleveland Orchestra members, and all faculty maintain an active performance career. In 2009, BW added internationally- renowned Wagnerian soprano Jane Eaglen to the staff, joining the celebrated 20th-century music performer Nanette Canfield, and heldentenor Dr. Timothy Mussard. The instrumental staff features Jack Sutte, Cleveland Orchestra trumpeter and Dr. Robert Mayerovitch, author and active clinician for keyboard studies.

Eric Meretzky, which took place in the fictional universe of Zork. The books were published by Tor Books. Like the Zork video games, the books were a form of interactive fiction which offered the reader a choice of actions symbolized by pages to turn to, as in the contemporary book series Choose Your Own Adventure or the later Give Yourself Goosebumps series. The protagonists of each book were a boy and girl, called Bill and June on Earth and re-dubbed Bivotar and Juranda in Zork. The settings and plots were reminiscent of locations and events from the Zork universe. At each ending the player received a score from zero to ten based on how far they had made it through the book and, if the ending were a failure, a chance to try again at the incorrect choice. The books also usually contained a \\"cheater trap\\", reached by opting to use an item which does not exist (at least not in the current book). In these traps, the story abruptly ends; the reader is chastised and not given a chance to try again. The books were written in English and translated into Spanish. All four books were published as \\"What-Do-I-Do-Now Books\\". Copies did contain publication errors--page numbers that the reader was directed to turn to or turn back to were at times incorrect. The first three books were published as a trilogy in August and September 1983; each has the titles of the other two listed opposite the cover page. The fourth book in the series was published in October 1984. The Forces of Krill The first book in the Zork series, The Forces of Krill, used familiar Zork locations and scoring systems. Bivotar and Juranda are on a quest to find the three Palantirs of Zork and to defeat the evil sorcerer Krill. There were 20 possible endings. The Malifestro Quest The second book in the Zork series, The Malifestro Quest, contained several inside jokes for those familiar with the Zork games. Bivotar and Juranda must rescue the hero Syovar and two quirky elves, Fred and Max, from the evil wizard Malifestro. There were 18 possible endings. The Cavern of Doom The third book in the Zork series, The Cavern of Doom, tried to capture the \\"exploring the dungeon\\" motif of the earlier games. Bivotar and Juranda search the Cavern of Doom, which is an uncharted portion of the Great Underground Empire and the site of several mysterious disappearances, including the elves Fred and Max. There were 17 possible endings. Conquest at Quendor The fourth book in the Zork series, the Conquest of Quendor, featured silly riddles reminiscent of Zork II. Bivotar and Juranda search for the Helm of Zork in an attempt to bring peace to the Land of Frobozz, in defiance of Jeearr, a riddle-telling demon. There are 17 possible endings. Other books based on Zork Of six novels published as \\"Infocom Books\\" by Avon Books between 1989‚Äì1991, two were directly based on Zork: The Zork Chronicles by George Alec Effinger (1990) and The Lost City of Zork by Robin W.

It is owned by Beasley Broadcast Group and airs a country music radio format, calling itself \\"Country 103.7.\\" Its primary country competitor is iHeartMedia's WKKT. WSOC-FM's studios are located on South Boulevard in Charlotte's South End and the transmitter is located in East Charlotte near Reedy Creek Park. WSOC shares its call sign with previously co-owned WSOC-TV, Charlotte's ABC network affiliate. History=Early years WSOC-FM first signed on the air in 1948.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 224 It was the second FM station to begin broadcasting in Charlotte after 106.7 WMIT, which signed on in 1941. (Because WMIT moved to Black Mountain, North Carolina in the 1960s, WSOC-FM can claim it's now Charlotte's oldest FM station.) WSOC-FM originally was powered at 38,000 watts, a third of its current output. The FM station mostly simulcast programming from sister station AM 1240 WSOC, an NBC Red Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" In 1960, 1240 WSOC moved to AM 930.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-199 Also in 1960, WSOC-TV first went on the air. Because WSOC-AM-FM were NBC Radio affiliates, WSOC-TV also carried NBC-TV programs. As network programming moved from radio to television, WSOC-AM-FM began airing a local full service middle of the road format with hourly NBC Radio newscasts, sports and features. During the 1960s, WSOC-FM received FCC permission to increase power to its current 100,000 watts, expanding coverage with a good radio to Winston- Salem, Asheboro and Spartanburg.Radio-Locator.com/WSOC-FM WSOC-FM began airing an easy listening format separate from the AM station, although still simulcasting some segments from 930. 1970s In the 1960s, Charlotte had two AM country stations, WKTC and WAME, but no FM stations were broadcasting country music in stereo. In 1971, WSOC-FM flipped to a country format, that at first was mostly automated.Mark Price, \\"Roper Snags Top CMA Award - WSOC-FM Morning Host Wins As Broadcast Personality of the Year,\\" The Charlotte Observer, October 5, 2003. Don Bell worked as WSOC-FM's program director from 1975 to 1987, hiring many of the station's most popular announcers, and working on the air as well. He played a major role in making WSOC one of Charlotte's top radio stations. Before moving to Charlotte, Bell worked at KFRE and KMJ in Fresno, California and WIOD in Miami.Mark Washburn, \\"Funeral Service Set for Radio's Bell - Ex-Program Manager Led WSOC, Was Active in Humanitarian Work,\\" The Charlotte Observer, February 2, 2002. In 1977, despite a consultant's view that Country would never be a viable FM format, Bell moved forward with his plans to take WSOC off an automated system and go with live DJs from morning to night. Longtime veteran John Harper was replaced with morning show host Bob Call. Call, who thought he was auditioning for a spot on WSOC's AM station, decided to take the job even though he had no knowledge or appreciation for country music. Bill Ellis, who started at WSOC as a copywriter in 1975, was given helicopter traffic duties and served as the station's mid-day announcer. Country music was evolving, and its popularity grew as the result of the movie Urban Cowboy. WSOC-FM was getting ready for big changes. Edd Robinson moved to afternoons on WSOC-FM in 1979 after 11 years at 1480 WAME, which had left the country format. He remained at WSOC-FM until late 1987.Jeff Borden, \\"WSOC Shocked by Resignation of Afternoon Drive Disc Jockey,\\" The Charlotte Observer, January 1, 1988. Bob Brandon, who also had worked on WAME, was hired by Bell in 1981 to do the evening shift. He remained with the station until 1986. He also briefly did a stint under Paul Johnson in 1995-1996. 1980s In 1980, Bob Call moved to Denver as Program Director at KYGO. WSOC-FM hired Bill Dollar as its morning host. Dollar had worked for WGST in Atlanta and was familiar with WSOC-FM owner Cox Enterprises. He wanted to start his own station in Boone, North Carolina and had no plans to stay long. Bell said he liked Dollar's voice and warmth, and the fact that he wasn't that funny, unlike many morning hosts. Bell wanted WSOC-FM to be full service radio like WBT, combining information and entertainment. In 1982, Dollar succeeded Robert Murphy of WAYS/WROQ, and unlike Murphy, he did it without attacking the locally based televangelist organization, The PTL Club, often called \\"Pass the Loot\\" by its critics. Dollar did not even take advantage of the situation when PTL experienced scandal in 1987.Jeff Borden, \\"Born to Be Mild - Charlotte's No. 1 Deejay, Bill Dollar, Has Taken the Middle Road to the Top,\\" The Charlotte Observer, May 14, 1989. On June 29, 1987, Bill Ellis did his midday show for the last time before leaving to do the morning show for 100.5 WSSL-FM in Greenville, South Carolina, after 11 years at WSOC-FM. Program director Paul Johnson said Ellis would likely not have replaced Dollar anytime soon, so if he wanted to be a morning host, he had to go elsewhere. Ellis went on to host WSSL's Ellis and James Show, garnering 5 CMA Broadcast nominations. Bill Ellis was hired on at WSSL by former WSOC general sales manager John Cullen who had become WSSL's general manager.Jeff Borden, \\"Bill Ellis Joins S.C. Radio Station,\\" The Charlotte Observer, July 1, 1987. For seven years, Dollar was Charlotte's top DJ, and in October 1989 after three nominations, he received the Broadcast Personality of the Year award (medium markets) from the Country Music Association.Tony Brown, \\"Keeping Win Quiet Was Tough, Bill Dollar Says,\\" The Charlotte Observer, October 12, 1989. In Fall 1989, Dollar returned to the #1 position after WRFX's John Boy and Billy replaced him in the summer, a ratings period during which urban contemporary 97.9 WPEG became number one.Tony Brown, \\"John Boy, Billy Dethrone Dollar,\\" The Charlotte Observer, October 13, 1989.Tony Brown, \\"DJ Bill Dollar Is No. 1 Again in Mornings,\\" The Charlotte Observer, January 13, 1990. 1990s In 1991, WPEG became Charlotte's top station and remained in that position, though WSOC-FM was still one of the top country stations in the United States.Mark Washburn, \\"WSOC's Fall From Radio Grace: Top Dog to Underdog,\\" The Charlotte Observer, April 1, 2001. In 1992, Cox sold WSOC-AM and WSOC-FM, but kept the TV station. The FM station went to EZ Communications (also owner of WMXC) as part of a trade with WHQT in Miami. The AM went to Bible Broadcasting Network, switching to a Christian talk and teaching format, becoming WYFQ.Jennifer Ffrench Parker, \\"WSOC Says Swap Will Change Little,\\" The Charlotte Observer, September 30, 1992. In August 1994, Dollar had been WSOC-FM's morning host for 14 years, the longest of anyone in Charlotte. But Dollar's ratings with 25-54 listeners were down. When he returned from vacation, on his 44th birthday, he learned he had been moved to middays, replaced in the morning by Paul Schadt and Cindy O'Day. Program director Paul Johnson said the change would attract younger listeners with \\"a more contemporary face\\" and \\"energy, entertainment and fun.\\" The station tried to claim Dollar asked for the change, but he would not confirm that.Tim Funk, \\"Station's Switch Puts Dollar on Air Later, in Midday Slot,\\" The Charlotte Observer, August 25, 1994. Claire B. Lang replaced O'Day as Schadt's co-host in October 1996. She had previously been a newscaster on John Boy and Billy's show. Johnson called her \\"outrageous.\\" She would continue as \\"Inside NASCAR\\" host on The Nashville Network as well as covering NASCAR for Sports Illustrated.Kay McFadden, \\"WSOC-FM Adds Morning Co-Host: Claire B. Lang,\\" The Charlotte Observer, The (NC) - October 10, 1996. Dollar was killed in a head- on collision near Gastonia in November 1996, and WSOC declared a day of mourning.Kay McFadden, \\"Fans Mourn Death of DJ Bill Dollar - Wreck Kills Award-Winning Radio Veteran,\\" The Charlotte Observer, November 23, 1996. Music director Rick McCracken, who also worked overnights, took Dollar's slot temporarily and later returned to late nights. Mike Terry, who had hosted middays before, moved back to that slot to replace Dollar, and Jason Dean took over afternoons from Terry. Dean had hosted \\"The Nite Shift\\" from Los Angeles on the Blair Garner \\"After Midnight Entertainment\\" network, and he had also worked in San Francisco and Detroit. John Crenshaw's \\"Country Heartlines\\" continued in the evenings.Kay McFadden, \\"WSOC-FM Kicks Off Some Changes in Talent Lineup,\\" The Charlotte Observer, March 25, 1997. WSOC-FM would gain four sister stations (WBAV-FM, WBAV-AM, WNKS and WPEG) in December 1996 from Evergreen Media, as part of a multi-market swap. (Evergreen received EZ Communications' Philadelphia stations WIOQ and WUSL in return.)http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-12-06.pdf; EZ was bought by American Radio Systems in July 1997. On September 19, 1997, ARS was acquired by CBS's Infinity Broadcasting, making WSOC-FM a CBS owned and operated station. In December 1997, Schadt moved to rival country outlet WKKT after 16 years at WSOC.Mark Price, \\"Country DJ Schadt Moves to WKKT-FM,\\" The Charlotte Observer, January 8, 1998. In February 1998, WSOC fired Schadt's partner Claire B. Lang. WSOC was still number two in Charlotte, and hoping to stay that way, when the station added Big Paul and \\"Aunt Eloise\\" of WTQR in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The two morning hosts intended to go back and forth between the two stations, and syndication to more stations was considered. \\"Big Paul\\" Franklin was from Gastonia, while the identity of Aunt Eloise remained a mystery.Jeri Rowe, \\"Big Paul and Aunt Eloise: Charlotte to Air WTQR Show,\\" Greensboro News & Record, February 26, 1998. In October 2008, \\"Aunt Eloise\\" was revealed to be Toby Young after he was fired from WTQR.\\"WTQR Fires Aunt Eloise,\\" Winston- Salem Journal, October 4, 2008 The pairing lasted only eight months. Dave Temple and Terry Blake would then take over. 2000s In Fall 2000, WSOC-FM was 12th in the Charlotte market, while WKKT was fifth. Infinity Broadcasting management needed to make changes. Kevin O'Neal became program director and WSOC-FM brought back its outside-of-morning-drive policy of playing 12 songs in a row, without commercials. It hired top Columbia, South Carolina personality Jeff Roper as morning host with Blake remaining as sidekick. The strategy worked. In Summer 2001, WSOC was Charlotte's top station for the first time in about 10 years.Mark Washburn, \\"WSOC Regains Top Spot - Station Credits Contests, NASCAR, and a New Morning Show for Gains,\\" The Charlotte Observer, October 25, 2001. Roper's Morning Show was named 2003 Country Music Association Broadcast Personality of the Year (large markets) in 2003. Roper made it to number two among morning hosts in the ratings.\\"Radio Ratings Changes,\\" The Charlotte Observer, January 23, 2005 Roper left WSOC-FM as Program Director while it was at #2 in the ratings, behind adult contemporary WLYT. Roper returned to Columbia to sign on on a new station, WWNU. Infinity changed its name to CBS Radio on December 14, 2005 as part of the spin-off of CBS' motion picture and cable television assets under a relaunched Viacom. On February 24, 2009, the Academy of Country Music announced that WSOC-FM had won the award for \\"Major Market Radio Station of the Year.\\" 2010s Catherine Lane, midday personality for WSOC-FM, was nominated for On-Air Personality of the Year by ACM. Charlotte Observer writer Mark Washburn calls morning man Rob Tanner \\"one of the most successful figures in the history of country radio in Charlotte.\\" On September 26, 2011, WSOC-FM rebranded as \\"The New 103.7.\\" It changed slogans from \\"Charlotte's #1 Country\\" to \\"Country's Hottest Hits.\\" The station dropped most songs recorded before the 1990s, while increasing an emphasis on current music.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/53712/wsoc- rebrands/ Tanner in the Morning welcomed new co-host Guenn Schneider on October 4, 2012. Previously, she worked for CBS Radio sister stations WNKS and WKQC. On October 2, 2014, CBS Radio announced that it would trade its Tampa and Charlotte stations (including WSOC-FM), as well as WIP in Philadelphia to the Beasley Broadcast Group in exchange for 5 stations located in Miami and Philadelphia.CBS And Beasley Swap Philadelphia/Miami For Charlotte/Tampa from Radio Insight (October 2, 2014) The swap was completed on December 1, 2014. In June 2015, WSOC-FM had its highest ratings in the PPM era.

Overview Historically, antiperistasis as a type of explanation was applied to numerous phenomena, from the interaction of quicklime with cold water, to the origin of thunder and lightning. In his Timaeus Plato introduces the concept of periosis pushing around in order to explain various phenomena.Jan Opsomer, Antiperistasis: A Platonic Theory, in: Jim√©nez, L√≥pez, Aguilar (eds.), Plutarco, Plat√≥n y Arist√≥teles. Actas del V Congreso Internacional de la I.P.S. (1999), p. 417-430 His 'theory' has been most famously adopted by Aristotle who made popular the term antiperistasis.The etymology points to Ancient Greek, ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒπœÄŒµœÅŒØœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ, formed of ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒØ (\\"against\\") and œÄŒµœÅŒØœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ (\\"standing around\\") In a nutshell it was \\"the doctrine that a moving object, which is no longer in touch with the mover, is moved by the medium through which it moves.\\" Golitsis P, Simplicius and Philoponus on the Authority of Aristotle, Brill‚Äôs Companion to the Reception of Aristotle in Antiquity, (ed.) A. Falcon, Leiden, Boston: Brill, 2016 Logically, it is connected to the idea that void does not exist. It was using this explanation that academic philosophers claimed that cold, on many occasions, increases a body's temperature, and dryness increases its moisture. Thus, it was said, quicklime (CaO) was apparently set ablaze when doused with cold water (an effect later explained as an exothermic reaction). It was also the understood reason for why water, such as that in wells, appeared warmer in winter than in summer (later explained as an example of sensory adaptation). It was also suggested that thunder and lightning were the results of antiperistasis caused by the coldness of the sky. Peripatetic philosophers, who were followers of Aristotle, made extensive use of the principle of antiperistasis. According to such authors, Other examples used by the proponents of antiperistasis included the aphoristical saying of Hippocrates, \\"the viscera are hottest in the winter\\"; and the production of hail in the upper atmosphere, believed to occur only in the summer due to the increased heat of the sun.

The domains are regularly spaced, with period in a multiple of the desired wavelength of operation. The structure is designed to achieve quasi-phase-matching (QPM) in the material. Periodically poled crystals are frequently used as nonlinear optical materials. They are more efficient at second-harmonic generation than crystals of the same material without periodic structure. The material for the crystals is usually a wide band gap inorganic crystal, or in some cases a suitable organic polymer. Some popular materials in current use are potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP), lithium niobate, and lithium tantalate. The periodic structure is created in the crystal using a range of techniques. Pulsed electric field, electron bombardment, thermal pulsing, or other methods can be used to reposition the atoms in the lattice, creating oriented domains. This can be achieved either during the growth of the crystal, or subsequently. \\"An introduction to methods of periodic poling for second-harmonic generation\\", M Houe and P D Townsend, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, Volume 28 (1995), Number 9.

The firm was later acquired by Symantec Corporation and the product continued to be developed by the original author, Michael Kahl. Versions 3 and later were essentially a subset of C++ and supported basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as single inheritance, and extensions to the C standard that conformed more closely to the needs of Mac OS programming. After version 6, the OOP facilities were expanded to a full C++ implementation, and the product was rebranded Symantec C++ for versions 7 and 8, then under development by different authors. Think C, and later Symantec C++, featured a class library and framework for Mac programming called the Think Class Library (TCL), which was used extensively for Macintosh application development. The Lightspeed and Think C integrated development environment (IDE) influenced other such environments, though considered not as advanced as that belonging to Think Pascal, its sister language product. It was considered the standard environment when Macintosh Programmer's Workshop (MPW) was considered an overpriced niche product, and most Macintosh products were developed in it for many years. However, with the transition of the Mac central processing unit (CPU) from the Motorola 68000 series (68K) to the PowerPC, Symantec was widely seen as having fallen behind, and competitor Metrowerks' product CodeWarrior took control of the market. Despite the decline in popularity of their IDE, Symantec was eventually chosen by Apple to provide next-generation C/C++ compilers for MPW in the form of Sc/Scpp for 68K alongside MrC/MrCpp for PowerPC. These remained Apple's standard compilers until the arrival of Mac OS X replaced them with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Symantec subsequently exited the developer tool business. Reception Bruce F. Webster of Byte named Lightspeed C product of the month for September 1986. While criticizing the documentation as its \\"single greatest weakness\\", Webster stated that Lightspeed C would be the choice if he had to select one compiler for the Macintosh. Byte in 1989 listed Lightspeed C as among the \\"Distinction\\" winners of the Byte Awards, stating that it \\"wins our respect because of its powerful features and low price\\".

Azhdarchids included some of the largest-known flying animals of all time, but smaller cat-size members have also been found.Cat- Size Flying Reptile Shakes Up Pterosaur Family Tree Originally considered a sub-family of Pteranodontidae, Nesov (1984) named the azhdarchinae to include the pterosaurs Azhdarcho, Quetzalcoatlus, and \\"Titanopteryx\\" (now known as Arambourgiania). They were among the last known surviving members of the pterosaurs, and were a rather successful group with a worldwide distribution. By the time of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, most pterosaur families except for the Azhdarchidae disappear from the fossil record, but recent studies indicate a wealth in pterosaurian faunas, including pteranodontids, nyctosaurids, tapejarids and several indeterminate forms. In several analysis, some taxa such as Navajodactylus, Bakonydraco and Montanazhdarcho were moved from Azhdarchidae to other clades.Carroll, N. REASSIGNMENT OF MONTANAZHDARCHO MINOR AS A NON-AZHDARCHID MEMBER OF THE AZHDARCHOIDEA, SVP 2015 Description Artist's reconstruction of Hatzegopteryx hunting the ornithopod Zalmoxes. Hatzegopteryx (A-B) compared with Arambourgiania (C) and Quetzalcoatlus (D-E). This illustrates the difference between the \\"blunt- beaked\\" azhdarchids and the \\"slender-beaked\\" forms. Azhdarchids are characterized by their long legs and extremely long necks, made up of elongated neck vertebrae which are round in cross section. Most species of azhdarchids are still known mainly from their distinctive neck bones and not much else. The few azhdarchids that are known from reasonably good skeletons include Zhejiangopterus and Quetzalcoatlus. Azhdarchids are also distinguished by their relatively large heads and long, spear-like jaws. There are two major types of azhdarchid morphologies: the \\"blunt-beaked\\" forms with shorter and deeper bills and the \\"slender-beaked\\" forms with longer and thinner jaws.Witton, M. P. (2013). Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy. Princeton University Press. It had been suggested azhdarchids were skimmers, but further research has cast doubt on this idea, demonstrating that azhdarchids lacked the necessary adaptations for a skim-feeding lifestyle, and that they may have led a more terrestrial existence similar to modern storks and ground hornbills. Most large azhdarchids probably fed on small prey, including hatchling and small dinosaurs; in an unusual modification of the azhdarchid bauplan, the unusually robust Hatzegopteryx may have tackled larger prey as the apex predator in its ecosystem. In another departure from typical azhdarchid lifestyles, the jaw of Alanqa may possibly be an adaptation to crushing shellfish and other hard foodstuffs. Azhdarchids are generally medium- to large-sized pterosaurs, with the largest achieving wingspans of , but several small-sized species have recently been discovered. Another azhdarchid that is currently unnamed, recently discovered in Transylvania, may be the largest representative of the family thus far discovered. This unnamed specimen (nicknamed \\"Dracula\\" by paleontologists), currently on display in the Altm√ºhltal Dinosaur Museum in Bavaria is estimated to have a wingspan of , although similarities to the contemporary azhdarchid Hatzegopteryx have also been noted. Systematics Azhdarchids were originally classified as close relatives of Pteranodon due to their long, toothless beaks. Others have suggested they were more closely related to the toothy ctenochasmatids (which include filter-feeders like Ctenochasma and Pterodaustro). Currently it is widely agreed that azhdarchids were closely related to pterosaurs such as Tupuxuara and Tapejara. Taxonomy Classification after Unwin 2006, except where noted.

It is known from fragmentary remains including the distinctive, elongated neck vertebrae that characterizes members of the family Azhdarchidae, a family that includes many giant pterosaurs such as Quetzalcoatlus. The name Azhdarcho comes from the Persian word azhdar (), a dragon-like creature in Persian mythology. The type species is Azhdarcho lancicollis. The specific epithet lancicollis is derived from the Latin words lancea (meaning \\"lance\\" or \\"spear\\") and collum (\\"neck\\"). History The fossil remains of Azhdarcho were recovered in the Kyzyl Kum desert (from the Taykarshinskaya unit of the Bissekty Formation) by Lev A. Nesov during expeditions to Central Asia in 1974-1981. The type specimen, given the catalog number –¶–ù–ò–ì–†–º—É–∑–µ–π 1/11915 (TsNIGRmuzey), consists of an anterior neck vertebra. Twelve paratypes were referred, including several other neck vertebrae, elements from the wing and leg, and pieces of the jaw. These specimens, along with other vertebrate fossils collected during the expeditions, were deposited at the F.N. Chernyshev Central Geologic Exploration Museum in St. Petersberg. In his description of the type specimen of Azhdarcho lancicollis, Nesov noted its distinctive neck vertebrae, which are extremely elongated and round in cross section at mid-length. He pointed out similar characteristics in several other pterosaurs, and used them to erect the new subfamily Azhdarchinae, within the Pteranodontidae. Nesov also referred Quetzalcoatlus and Arambourgiania (then known as Titanopteryx) to this subfamily, which was subsequently re-classified as the family Azhdarchidae. He also suggested that similar, thin-walled pterosaur bones from the Lance Formation of Wyoming could be assigned to a species of Azhdarcho, using this as evidence of commonalities between the fauna of Late Cretaceous central Asia and western North America. However, subsequent research has not followed this suggestion, and A. lancicollis is the only currently recognized species of Azhdarcho. Classification Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic placement of Azhdarcho within the clade Neoazhdarchia. The cladogram is based on a topology recovered by Brian aAndres and Timothy Myers in 2013. Paleoecology alt= In the original description of Azhdarcho, Nesov noted that because of the way the vertebrae articulated, the pterosaur would have had very limited flexibility in the neck. Azhdarcho could not rotate its neck at all, though it could flex the neck vertically to a certain degree. Nesov suggested that pterosaurs like Azhdarcho may have fed in a manner similar to the modern Skimmer, with their long necks allowing them to scoop prey from the water's surface and small depths without needing to dive. However, recent research has shown that skimming requires more energy and anatomical specializations than previously thought, and that large pterosaurs like Azhdarcho probably were not capable of skimming. The long neck would also have allowed azhdarchids to hunt for food in the water or on the bottom while swimming, or to hunt poorly flying vertebrates in the air, though Nesov also suggested that the animal would have needed stable weather conditions to fly well, and suggested azhdarchid habitats needed to be dominated by even, mild winds. However studies by Mark Witton points to a different direction suggesting that azhdarchids in general were terrestrial stalkers.

Roebuck was educated at Giggleswick School in North Yorkshire, also the alma mater of Keith Duckworth, another well-known figure in Formula One. He wrote freelance articles for many publications as well as being Press Officer for the Embassy Hill F1 team in 1975. At the same time he was writing for Autosport magazine and became their Grand Prix correspondent in 1976. Roebuck's weekly column, entitled ‚Äò5th Column‚Äô in deference to Emilio Mola Vidal, a Nationalist general in the Spanish Civil War, became a must-read for its insights into drivers, team managers and some of the self-important bureaucrats running F1 in the late 1970s and 1980s. While covering F1 (a category of racing that he loved more than any other) he became close to several drivers, notably Gilles Villeneuve, Chris Amon, Keke Rosberg, Mario Andretti, Eddie Cheever, Derek Warwick, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. He is also a passionate collector of Roadster-era US oval racing literature. Among Roebuck's freelance outlets were Autosport, plus Autoweek in the USA and a retrospective column in Motor Sport. At the end of 2007 he stopped writing his weekly articles for Autosport magazine and website, to concentrate on his new position as editor-in-chief of Motor Sport magazine.

It serves the communities of Burlington and Oakville and provides a variety of canoe-based activities for local residents focusing primarily on the two disciplines of sprint canoe and sprint kayak. Burloak Canoe Club is located on Navy Flats along the banks of Sixteen Mile Creek and boasts a sizable building that caters not only to sport but to special events as well. History Burloak's history emerges from two former canoe clubs: The Mohawk Canoe Club, formerly situated in Burlington where the Spencer Smith Park now lies, and the Oakville Racing Canoe Club. Mohawk was started in 1958 by Mike Moir, Bill Pitt and Bill Dinsmore and raced under the black and green colours. The Oakville Racing Canoe Club was founded in 1974 by former Toronto Island paddler Bill Collins and Dorothy Jamieson. Oakville's colours were brown and white but when the two clubs merged in 1989, the new entity adopted a new set of official colours, though the Mohawk colours are often used unofficially to represent Burloak. The Burloak racing vest is solid black with a coloured badge on the front. Programs The Burloak Canoe Club is an integral part of the local community, participating and hosting local events and providing an alternative to people looking for a unique and challenging sport. Training and competition takes place in C-1, C-2, C-4 and IC-4, C-15 (War Canoe), K-1, K-2 and K-4 canoes and kayaks. Programs exist for all ages and skill levels, from Atom (under 10) to Masters (25 and over), and beginner to high-performance levels. Participation in local, regional and national competitions takes place for all age groups. Burloak Canoe Club also provides a venue for numerous local dragon boat teams during the summer months. Olympians and World Champions Many of the country's top paddlers have come out of the Burloak Canoe Club. These include Larry Cain (Olympic gold and silver medalist in C-1, 1984), Adam van Koeverden (Olympic gold and bronze medalist in K-1, 2004; Olympic silver in K-1, 2008 and 2012) and Mark Oldershaw (Olympic bronze medalist in C-1, 2012). In total, Burloak sent four paddlers to the Beijing Olympics (Brady Reardon, Mark Oldershaw, Adam van Koeverden and Chris Pellini). Oldershaw and Reardon are both from families that have sent previous generations of paddlers to the Olympics. Burloak has led the way in the development of women's canoeing (as distinct from kayaking), with notable paddlers Sheila Kuyper and Mallorie Nicholson. Nicholson won gold in the world championship C2 500 meter event in both 2010 and 2011., Burloak Paddlers Shine at World Championships Off season Winter training for all levels and ages takes place in the clubhouse between approximately November and May, revolving around weight training and aerobic exercise.

Pictures, produced by Robert Buckner, directed by Robert Florey, that stars Dennis Morgan and co-stars Dane Clark and Raymond Massey. The screenplay by Abem Finkel and Peter Milne is based on the 1943 autobiography of the same name by Robert Lee Scott Jr. (April 12, 1908 ‚Äì February 27, 2006). It recounts Scott's service with the Flying Tigers and the United States Army Air Forces in China and Burma during World War II. Plot At age 34, Army Air Force pilot Major Robert Lee Scott Jr. (Dennis Morgan) is considered too old to fly in combat, but he is recruited and volunteers to fly in a secret bombing mission from the Philippines against Tokyo, the Japanese capital. When the mission is cancelled after his arrival in India because of the fall of the Philippines, Scott is promoted to Colonel and assigned to fly transport aircraft. He flies dangerous, unescorted missions over The Hump from Burma to China in order to supply aviation gasoline and other much-needed supplies to the three squadrons of the American Volunteer Group, the Flying Tigers. Over time, Scott persuades General Claire Chennault (Raymond Massey), the commander of the Flying Tigers, to let him fly with his experienced airmen, like \\"Tex\\" Hill (John Ridgely), who have been fighting the Japanese as mercenaries while technically being members of the Chinese Air Force. Scott gets his chance to finally fly one of their Curtiss P-40B/C Tomahawks, engaging in aerial combat missions and becoming a double-ace while flying with the Tigers. On Independence Day, the 4th of July, during a surprise bombing and fighter raid on Japanese-occupied Hong Kong, Scott once again engages in combat with the infamous Japanese fighter ace nicknamed \\"Tokyo Joe\\" (Richard Loo). Although Scott's engine is hit and losing power, he suddenly drops his landing flaps, which quickly reduces his speed. \\"Joe\\" flies past and Scott sights him in his cross-hairs, firing at the Zero with his six machine-guns at very close range, setting \\"Joe\\"s fighter aflame. Scott says in triumph over his radio, \\"There's your six-feet of China, Joe, now go fill it up\\". The burning Zero fighter spins out of control and crashes, as Scott's damaged P-40 continues to smoke and lose altitude. When Scott doesn't return to base, and no further word of him is heard after several days, he is presumed killed in combat. As Chennault begins to write a letter to Scott's widow, he hears a growing commotion outside. A nighttime, torch-lit, gong-playing Chinese procession enters the Tigers' compound, carrying the injured Scott, who is bearing \\"Tokyo Joe\\"s Samurai sword. After a physical examination, despite Scott's assurances that he is fine, the doctor grounds him because of his age, combat fatigue, and recurring Malaria. He has to sit-out the largest air-raid against the Japanese ever planned in China. As Scott listens through an open window to the mission briefing, Chennault arrives at a command decision. He tells Scott that a new, larger P-40 fighter, with a more powerful engine and additional firepower, is his to fly for one final mission, a gift from \\"the old man\\". Elated, Scott goes to the plane, fires up the engine, and rapidly gets airborne. He quickly climbs skyward to join the squadrons of fighters and bombers formed-up and heading east toward certain victory.

Scott served as a technical adviser and flew in a number of sequences, reprising his role as a Flying Tiger.Orriss 1984, p. 115. Reception While most moviegoers may have regarded the film as typical of Hollywood, the scriptwriters were instructed to be faithful to Col. Robert Lee Scott Jr.'s original account of his exploits over China, and to provide backstory to enlarge his character. By basing the film on exploits of historical figures (only occasionally resorting to fictional characters such as \\"Tokyo Joe\\"), the film gained considerable authenticity. However, by 1945 the American film-going public were wary of what was essentially seen as another in a series of patriotic, \\"flag-waving\\" films. Critics relegated it to an \\"also-ran\\" position, regarding the sub-plot of Scott's inspirational message as forced. The New York Times reviewer, Bosley Crowther noted that the \\"... pious injection of the spiritual in an otherwise noisy action film is patently ostentatious and results in a maudlin effect\\".Crowther, Bosley. \\"God Is My Co-Pilot (1945, Warner Film, Opens at Strand.\\" The New York Times, March 24, 1945. Retrieved: December 31, 2010. Variety wrote that Florey's direction \\"manages authenticity and obtains excellent performances\\", though \\"undoubtedly commercial license has pointed up some incidents for better dramatic flavor\\". Harrison's Reports wrote that though it was \\"quite thrilling in spots, offers little that is new for this type of picture\\". Wolcott Gibbs of The New Yorker did not find the film very authentic, writing that \\"I remain dubious about a flier who keeps turning around to talk to passengers in the back\\", and sarcastically noting that the Japanese were \\"clearly the most incompetent aviators in the world\\". Premiered in Macon, Georgia, Scott's hometown, God Is My Co-Pilot had commercial success as one of the last of the patriotic productions to be released during wartime.Orriss 1984, p. 116. In a modern context, the film has received a revival in interest as it is now considered one of the \\"classic\\" aviation films, primarily due to its aerial scenes, which were always considered one of its assets.Hardwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 51. Along with Scott's role in telling the story of the Flying Tigers, God is My Co-Pilot is now considered to be more a historical record.Dolan 1989, pp. 136‚Äì137. Box Office According to Warner Bros records, the film earned $3,373,000 domestically and $1,035,000 in foreign countries. References=NotesCitationsBibliography * Dolan, Edward F.

She taught feminist studies for many years at Stanford University. She is best known for critically acclaimed biographies of poets Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath (along with Plath's husband Ted Hughes), and jazz musician Billy Tipton. Middlebrook was preparing a biography of the Roman poet Ovid, to be published in 2008.Viking Press had planned to publish the work in 2008 because that would be the two-millennium anniversary of Ovid‚Äôs banishment from Rome and of his completion of Metamorphoses.Middlebrook often referred to Ovid's feat of having work continually in circulation since his death some two thousand years ago, a feat that eludes even Homer. Her death brought that project to a close. Middlebrook held no illusions about the difficulties facing a biographer. In an interview on her professional life, she said: \\"With a biography there is no straight line; all is muddled. You don't know what you know, you don't know what you don't know; if you find anything you make a note about it because some day it may find its partner. You have to have very good ways of keeping track of what you have found and where you have put it.\\" Early life Middlebrook was born Diane Helen Wood, in Pocatello, Idaho, the oldest of three daughters, born to teenage parents. In 1945, the family moved to Spokane, Washington. Education and teaching career Middlebrook expressed her desire to become a published poet and writer, but was not encouraged by her family. She paid her own way through college. She entered Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, then transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961. She entered Stanford University as an assistant professor of English in 1966, then obtained a Ph.D. from Yale University in 1968. Her doctoral dissertation was a combined study of American poet Wallace Stevens and American poet/philosopher/essayist Walt Whitman; her doctoral advisor was the noted American writer and literary critic Harold Bloom.She claimed the dissertation wasn't very good, and that \\"you can‚Äôt find my book in the library, because it isn't in the Whitman place, it isn't in the Stevens place, it's in some American literature place.\\" Middlebrook began her teaching career at Stanford as an assistant professor in 1966 and gradually worked her way up to university professor and associate dean positions. She won a number of fellowships, grants, and awards along the way. She resigned from Stanford in 2002 to concentrate fully on her writing. By this time, she was already a professor emerita. Middlebrook had not concentrated on feminist studies when she was tapped for Stanford's new Center for Research on Women (eventually to become the Clayman Institute for Gender Research), one of the first such centers in the nation in the 1970s. She once stated that her chief qualifications were her sex and her availability. She directed the Center from 1977 to 1979. She was noted for her diversity of study subjects; one syllabus from that era lists both Ovid and Queen Latifah. Middlebrook received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College, the Stanford Humanities Center, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, and the Rockefeller Study Center of Bellagio. She was a founding trustee of the Djerassi Resident Artists Program, an interdisciplinary arts center in the Santa Cruz Mountains. She was chair of Stanford's Feminist Studies Program from 1985 to 1988. Middlebrook received two honors from Stanford for her teaching effort. In 1977 she was given The Dean's Award; in 1987 she was given the Walter J. Gores Award. She also received the Richard W. Lyman service award. Work as a biographer Middlebrook once stated why she preferred preparing biographic work to other fields of study: \\"One of the reasons I like working on biographies is that it takes a long time, you don‚Äôt have to work quickly. People are going to stay dead.\\"Cynthia Haven, \\"Telling Tales Out of School\\", Stanford Magazine, November/December 2003. When asked why she had picked Ovid as a subject for a biography, she said: \\"No estates, no psychotherapy, no interviews, no history‚ÄîI just make it up.\\" She noted that the historical record of Ovid's life is scanty, so a biographer must read the person from the person's literary output - all we know is in his poetry; the biographer is forced to rely on the text itself. Middlebrook's debut as a biographer was almost accidental: on her 41st birthday, she received an invitation from the Sexton estate to write a biography of confessional poet Anne Sexton. The resulting effort, Anne Sexton: A Biography, spent eight weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, which is unusual for a biography of a poet. It was a finalist for the National Book Award and for the National Book Critics Circle Award; it was awarded a gold medal in nonfiction from the Commonwealth Club of California. Joyce Carol Oates called the book ‚Äúsympathetic but resolutely unsentimental ... intelligent, sensitive, at times harrowing.‚ÄùFrom a review in The Washington Post newspaper, Haven, \\"Diane Middlebrook, professor emeritus and legendary biographer, dies at 68\\", Stanford Report, December 15, 2007. The book was somewhat controversial, as Middlebrook was given access to (and freely used) some 300 hours of Sexton's sessions with psychiatrists. Suits Me was a finalist for a Lambda Foundation Literary Award and a bestselling biography of Billy Tipton, a female jazz musician who lived an entire professional and private life as a man. He/she married (five times) and had children (who were adopted). The wives, and everyone else, were unaware of the disguise. (Said one of his sons, \\"He‚Äôll always be Dad to me.\\") London's Financial Times wrote: \\"Tipton may have spent his life fearing exposure, but he/she could not have wished for a more perceptive or sympathetic biographer than Middlebrook.\\"Quoted in obituary, Stanford Report. Her Husband was a bestseller. It was a 2004 finalist for the Bay Area Book Reviewers Award in non-fiction. In 2006 the French translation won the Prix Du Meilleur Livre Etranger. The New York Times called the book \\"inspiring\\", \\"attentive and clear-eyed\\". Middlebrook was noted for her openness and honest, sometimes \\"brutal\\" biographical writing. \\"The more that each of us knows about each of the other human beings in the world, the better off [we] are. It‚Äôs true that it is very painful to be exposed to people‚Äôs curiosity. But it‚Äôs painful in a way that can only lead to self-knowledge, because it‚Äôs really not a big deal. In the scope of human endeavor, it‚Äôs not a big deal.\\" Writings After the book on Stevens and Whitman, Middlebrook wrote or edited three books on poetry: Worlds Into Words: Understanding Modern Poems (1980), Coming to Light: American Women Poets in the 20th Century (1985), and Selected Poems of Anne Sexton (1988). She also wrote her own book of poetry, Gin Considered as a Demon (1983). The edition of Anne Sexton's poetry helped lead to what can be described as Middlebrook's big break: her book Anne Sexton, A Biography published in 1991. The Sexton biography became a The New York Times bestseller and a finalist for the National Book Award. An intriguing blend of traditional biography, psychiatric study, and literary criticism, the book was written in an infectious, non-pedantic style that attracted a wide range of readers. Middlebrook then took an interesting detour from her study of poetry and poets in her next book, Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton (1998). The story of a jazz musician who was born a woman but lived for more than 50 years as a man, the book also sold well and showed that Middlebrook could range outside the traditional purview of the English Department. The Sexton biography might have led inevitably to Middlebrook's book about Anne Sexton's friend and fellow-suicide, Sylvia Plath. Published as Her Husband: Ted Hughes & Sylvia Plath, a Marriage in 2003, the biography steered a sensible and convincing course between partisan views of the two poets. Publishers Weekly called it the \\"gold standard\\" of the many books published about the couple, and it became a Los Angeles Times bestseller. Besides her books, Middlebrook published many articles on Sexton, Plath, Hughes, and other writers, such as Robert Lowell and Philip Larkin. She also reviewed a wide variety of books on subjects ranging from Helen Keller to the development of modern clothing. She said that her planned book on Ovid was an attempt to get inside a subject who \\"exists only in his texts.\\" Personal life and death Middlebrook was married three times. Her first two marriages, to Michael Shough and Jonathan Middlebrook, were annulled, though she continued to use the surname of \\"Middlebrook\\" professionally. She had one daughter, Leah Middlebrook, who also became a university professor and taught Comparative Literature and Romance Languages at the University of Oregon. In 1977, Middlebrook began a relationship with noted scientist Carl Djerassi, who helped invent the first contraceptive pill. They were married in 1985. Middlebrook retired in 2002,She was already Professor Emerita by that time. and persuaded Djerassi to retire from chemistry that year. (He continued to write fiction and drama.) She then concentrated more fully on her research, and she and Djerassi divided their time between their residences in San Francisco and London. Middlebrook underwent surgery for cancer in July 2001 and again in February 2004. Her death on 15 December 2007 was attributed to retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Djerassi stated that she continued working until the month before her death.

Transitive reductions were introduced by , who provided tight bounds on the computational complexity of constructing them. More technically, the reduction is a directed graph that has the same reachability relation as D. Equivalently, D and its transitive reduction should have the same transitive closure as each other, and its transitive reduction should have as few edges as possible among all graphs with this property. The transitive reduction of a finite directed acyclic graph (a directed graph without directed cycles) is unique and is a subgraph of the given graph. However, uniqueness fails for graphs with (directed) cycles, and for infinite graphs not even existence is guaranteed. The closely related concept of a minimum equivalent graph is a subgraph of D that has the same reachability relation and as few edges as possible. The difference is that a transitive reduction does not have to be a subgraph of D. For finite directed acyclic graphs, the minimum equivalent graph is the same as the transitive reduction. However, for graphs that may contain cycles, minimum equivalent graphs are NP-hard to construct, while transitive reductions can be constructed in polynomial time. Transitive reduction can be defined for an abstract binary relation on a set, by interpreting the pairs of the relation as arcs in a directed graph. In acyclic directed graphs The transitive reduction of a finite directed graph G is a graph with the fewest possible edges that has the same reachability relation as the original graph. That is, if there is a path from a vertex x to a vertex y in graph G, there must also be a path from x to y in the transitive reduction of G, and vice versa. The following image displays drawings of graphs corresponding to a non-transitive binary relation (on the left) and its transitive reduction (on the right). {124px  80px } The transitive reduction of a finite directed acyclic graph G is unique, and consists of the edges of G that form the only path between their endpoints. In particular, it is always a subgraph of the given graph. For this reason, the transitive reduction coincides with the minimum equivalent graph in this case. In the mathematical theory of binary relations, any relation R on a set X may be thought of as a directed graph that has the set X as its vertex set and that has an arc xy for every ordered pair of elements that are related in R. In particular, this method lets partially ordered sets be reinterpreted as directed acyclic graphs, in which there is an arc xy in the graph whenever there is an order relation x < y between the given pair of elements of the partial order. When the transitive reduction operation is applied to a directed acyclic graph that has been constructed in this way, it generates the covering relation of the partial order, which is frequently given visual expression by means of a Hasse diagram. Transitive reduction has been used on networks which can be represented as directed acyclic graphs (e.g. citation graphs or citation networks) to reveal structural differences between networks. In graphs with cycles In a finite graph that has cycles, the transitive reduction is not unique: there will be more than one graph on the same vertex set that has a minimum number of edges and has the same reachability relation as the given graph. Additionally, it may be the case that none of these minimum graphs is a subgraph of the given graph. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to characterize the minimum graphs with the same reachability relation as the given graph G. If G is an arbitrary directed graph, and H is a graph with the minimum possible number of edges having the same reachability relation as G, then H consists of *A directed cycle for each strongly connected component of G, connecting together the vertices in this component *An edge xy for each edge XY of the transitive reduction of the condensation of G, where X and Y are two strongly connected components of G that are connected by an edge in the condensation, x is any vertex in component X, and y is any vertex in component Y. The condensation of G is a directed acyclic graph that has a vertex for every strongly connected component of G and an edge for every two components that are connected by an edge in G. In particular, because it is acyclic, its transitive reduction can be defined as in the previous section. The total number of edges in this type of transitive reduction is then equal to the number of edges in the transitive reduction of the condensation, plus the number of vertices in nontrivial strongly connected components (components with more than one vertex). The edges of the transitive reduction that correspond to condensation edges can always be chosen to be a subgraph of the given graph G. However, the cycle within each strongly connected component can only be chosen to be a subgraph of G if that component has a Hamiltonian cycle, something that is not always true and is difficult to check. Because of this difficulty, it is NP-hard to find the smallest subgraph of a given graph G with the same reachability (its minimum equivalent graph). Computational complexity As Aho et al. show, when the time complexity of graph algorithms is measured only as a function of the number n of vertices in the graph, and not as a function of the number of edges, transitive closure and transitive reduction of directed acyclic graphs have the same complexity. It had already been shown that transitive closure and multiplication of Boolean matrices of size n √ó n had the same complexity as each other,Aho et al. credit this result to an unpublished 1971 manuscript of Ian Munro, and to a 1970 Russian-language paper by M. E. Furman. so this result put transitive reduction into the same class. The fastest known exact algorithms for matrix multiplication, as of 2015, take time O(n2.3729), and this gives the fastest known worst-case time bound for transitive reduction in dense graphs. Computing the reduction using the closure To prove that transitive reduction is as easy as transitive closure, Aho et al. rely on the already-known equivalence with Boolean matrix multiplication. They let A be the adjacency matrix of the given directed acyclic graph, and B be the adjacency matrix of its transitive closure (computed using any standard transitive closure algorithm). Then an edge uv belongs to the transitive reduction if and only if there is a nonzero entry in row u and column v of matrix A, and there is a zero entry in the same position of the matrix product AB. In this construction, the nonzero elements of the matrix AB represent pairs of vertices connected by paths of length two or more. Computing the closure using the reduction To prove that transitive reduction is as hard as transitive closure, Aho et al. construct from a given directed acyclic graph G another graph H, in which each vertex of G is replaced by a path of three vertices, and each edge of G corresponds to an edge in H connecting the corresponding middle vertices of these paths. In addition, in the graph H, Aho et al. add an edge from every path start to every path end. In the transitive reduction of H, there is an edge from the path start for u to the path end for v, if and only if edge uv does not belong to the transitive closure of G. Therefore, if the transitive reduction of H can be computed efficiently, the transitive closure of G can be read off directly from it. Computing the reduction in sparse graphs When measured both in terms of the number n of vertices and the number m of edges in a directed acyclic graph, transitive reductions can also be found in time O(nm), a bound that may be faster than the matrix multiplication methods for sparse graphs. To do so, apply a linear time longest path algorithm in the given directed acyclic graph, for each possible choice of starting vertex. From the computed longest paths, keep only those of length one (single edge); in other words, keep those edges (u,v) for which there exists no other path from u to v. This O(nm) time bound matches the complexity of constructing transitive closures by using depth first search or breadth first search to find the vertices reachable from every choice of starting vertex, so again with these assumptions transitive closures and transitive reductions can be found in the same amount of time.

Gordon Purcell (born February 14, 1959) is an American comics artist, perhaps best known for his Star Trek work, in particular his realistic renditions of the actors who play that franchise‚Äôs characters, as well as those of similarly licensed books, such as The X-Files, Xena: Warrior Princess, Lost in Space, Godzilla, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Barb Wire, and The Terminator. Early life Born in Lansing, Michigan, Purcell grew up reading Marvel Comics and DC Comics, and his love of drawing was sparked by watching cartoons of Spider-Man and Batman. The first comic book he read was a Disney comic book. He graduated from the University of Minnesota with Bachelor's degrees in Studio Arts and Theater Arts. Career Among Purcell's first work for DC Comics was a Doctor Light story published as a Bonus Book in The Flash #12 (May 1988). He has worked on numerous comic books, including Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, Soulsearchers and Company, Flare, The Flash, Fantastic Four, Superman, Wonder Man, Hulk vs. Nova, Moon Knight, What If‚Ä¶?, Race Warriors, Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Justice League, Ben 10, and Elvira. He drew Star Trek: Year Four for IDW, written by Trek story editor D. C. Fontana and Star Trek: The Last Generation, written by Andrew Steven Harris. He has worked on The Phantom for Moonstone and Beyond the Wall (Roman soldiers vs. monsters and barbarians) for IDW. Purcell drew the DC Retroactive: Justice League - The '70s one-shot in 2011. Purcell claims not to have a favorite company to work for but is attracted to projects based on the editor and other creators involved with them. He calls his work on Silver Sable as a project he particularly enjoyed, saying he feels that the book was \\"really going somewhere\\" by the end of his run. Purcell cites his work on Gammarauders, stating that having to ink his own pencils taught him a lot about what information he needed to give to his future inkers. In addition, Purcell cites his Star Trek work because he was allowed to visit the sets of those shows, which were among his favorites. In other media Purcell appeared on the October 19, 2005 episode of the game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? Having had only two hours of sleep, he won $50,000.00, deciding to quit when he could not answer the question of which U.S. state signed a 1790 treaty under the threat of being declared a foreign nation. The answer was \\"Rhode Island\\". He lost on Jeopardy! on May 24, 2010. On January 21, 2014, Purcell won a trip to Florida in the daily trivia contest that is part of TV's Live With Kelly and Michael. On January 25, 2019, Purcell again won a trip, this time to Antigua, in the daily trivia contest that is part of TV's Live With Kelly and Ryan. Personal life Purcell resides in Plymouth, Minnesota. He is not related to fellow comics-creators Steve Purcell or the late Howard Purcell.

In the current atmosphere of \\"Merry England\\" that included the revival of Christmas that was signalled by Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (1843), they all quickly developed their present reputations for being sixteenth century or earlier.\\"In spite of continual references to 'old carols' it is no common thing to find a carol of established early date in any modern source, oral, written or printed,\\" remarks Richard L.

The framework was fairly popular during the late (OS versions 8 and 9) Classic Mac OS era, and was primarily used with CodeWarrior. It was designed to work with a GUI editor called Constructor, which was primarily a resource editor specializing in UI elements. Constructor used several custom resource types, 'PPob' (\\"PowerPlant object\\"‚Äîa general view description), 'CTYP' (custom widgets), and Mcmd (used for dispatching menu-related events).

In February 2006, the PowerPlant class libraries were released as open source under the BSD license hosted on SourceForge. Although it could theoretically be recompiled for x86-64 Macs, it is Carbon-dependent and therefore can be used in 32-bit mode only. During its heyday from the mid-1990s until the early 2000s, PowerPlant was the most popular framework available for Mac programmers, replacing both the THINK Class Library and MacApp as the premier object-oriented toolkit for the MacOS; however, the transition to OS X was rather difficult for many PowerPlant programmers.

He was created in 1960, and currently has his own printed comic book, called Cebolinha, which was first released in 1973.Cebolinha at Turma da M√¥nica's official website His English name is Jimmy Five due to his hair composed of only five strands. Jimmy's family name is \\"Cebola\\" (Onion in Portuguese), and he has a little baby sister called Mary Angela (in Portuguese, Maria Cebolinha, after her brother's name), also based on a real person.Mary Angela at M√¥nica's Gang official website In the first adaptations of comics into English, the character's name was Stanley,http://www.planetagibi.com.br/2010/03/monica-em-ingles-real-one.html and later Frizz.  Concept and creation  Jimmy Five first appeared in the second issue of the comic book Zaz Traz in 1960, as a supporting character for Franklin. Mauricio de Sousa, creator of Monica's Gang, says he based the character on a child he knew while growing up in Mogi das Cruzes.Maur√≠cio - 70 anos - MundoHQ He was a friend of his brother M√°rcio, and the boy would also switch the letter \\"r\\" for \\"l\\" and, because of his pointy hair, he earned the nickname \\"cebolinha\\" from M√°rcio's and Mauricio's father. At first, he was a 4-year-old boy who was a friend of Franklin and his gang, he was the youngest boy. Originally he was supposed to appear in only one story, but the character ended up becoming so well received that he continued to appear more and more frequently. In the first stories Jimmy Five was hairy, after Sousa returned to the newspaper strips, his design became more and more simple and began to be drawn with fewer hair strands. Sousa liked the character and made him a separate protagonist of Franklin and Blu in 1961. In these comic strips in which he was the protagonist he had no personality, he was just a normal little boy who had several weird friends, among these weird friends came Smudge, a dirty boy who later became his best friends and sidekicks. After the introduction of Monica (based on the Sousa's daughter) in the comic strips in 1963 he began to share the leading role with her over the years. In 1964 he came to have his current look with 5 hair strands. In 1970 with the release of the comic book, Monica became the title protagonist in place of Jimmy Five, but a comic book for Jimmy Five began to be published 3 years later. Since Monica became protagonist Jimmy Five has gained different characteristics, as a antagonist who aims to defeat Monica and dominate the leadership of the neighborhood (in reference to the fact that the character had his role of protagonist reduced in favor of Monica).  Characteristics  Due to dyslalia, Jimmy Five is incapable of pronouncing the letter \\"r\\", replacing it with the letter l, in the Portuguese version, or with the letter w, in the English version. When the letter is used at the end of a word, however, he pronounces it normally (as in \\"car\\" or \\"locker\\"). Out of the main cast of Monica's Gang he is the only one to regularly wear shoes (when barefoot, he is also one of the rare characters to be shown with toes). He often complains and despairs over his main physical feature - his lack of any hair other than five single strands. His madcap attempts to rectify this often causes him (and those around him) a great deal of grief. He was originally drawn with a full head of hair, which often becomes a topic in his laments to the comic artist to \\"help him out\\" and restore his full head of hair. He is always plotting to steal either Samson or the title of \\"owner of the street\\" from Monica with his \\"infallible plans\\" (which were initially created by Specs), which always end in failure, mostly because Smudge (his best friend) accidentally reveals to Monica that she is in a trap. On some stories, he gathers the other boys of the gang just to pick on Monica. In some earlier stories, he devised background plans to find out the secret of her strength, but he always ended up beaten solely by her. Even with these frictions, Jimmy and Monica are still friends to each other. In the futuristic special edition stories, they are often portrayed as married or dating each other. Indeed, in Monica Teen, they are seen kissing. It was once revealed that Jimmy is not the first one in his family to have his famous speech impediment and that it caused all his relatives (minus his father) to believe he will never be able to pronounce 'r'. However, this is disproven in the Monica Teen stories, where he is said to take up speech-language pathology sessions to correct his speech impediment; however, he reverts to mispronunciation when under stress or close to girls (especially Monica). Whereas his family was always composed of his mother, father, and little sister, he once had a little brother, introduced in a 1972 story. Jimmy himself even ended the story asking his readers to send name suggestions to Editora Abril (which published Monica's Gangs' comics at that time), but the toddler ended up disappearing from the stories. Mauricio stated that he simply didn't have time to plan the continuation of his arrival, and the character was never featured again.  Related characters  * Mrs. Five (Dona Cebola, lit. Mrs. Onion) ‚Äì Jimmy's mother. Spends most of her time as a housekeeper, sometimes complaining about this. She is always worried about her weight. * Mr. Five (Seu Cebola, lit. Mr. Onion) - Jimmy's father. Similar to Smudge's father, he is drawn simply as an adult Jimmy, the only differences being his nose and his height. He's very affectionate to his family and hard working with his job at a local business company. Unlike Jimmy, he does not suffer from speech impairments. * Mary Angela (Maria Cebolinha) ‚Äì Jimmy's little sister, also introduced in 1960 in the comic book Zaz Traz. Her baby mind makes her a very curious and active person, which leads Jimmy to near-insanity, as he is the one to look for her when his parents are not home. Mary is based on Mauricio de Sousa's oldest daughter, Mari√¢ngela Spada e Sousa. * Fluffy (Floquinho) ‚Äì Jimmy's dog. Originally, the dog belonged to his cousin from the countryside, but ended up becoming Jimmy's. Due to his long hair, no one can tell his head from his tail, and vice versa. This long hair caught many reader's eyes, and after years of arguments between fans on what breed he really belonged to it was announced his breed as being Lhasa Apso. Apart from his head and tail problem, another recurring gag in his strips is the fact that his long hair can hide plenty of objects (at one point hiding a missing airplane and its pilot, a missing cruise ship, a hot-dog vendor, and the mailman all at once). * Nutty Ned (Louco, lit. Crazy man) ‚Äì Nutty is a former psychiatric hospital inhabitant, and no matter how hard the doctors try to get him, he always manages to escape (despite the fact that, in some original stories, he is living in a nonsensical house whose real replica can be found at Parque da M√¥nica in S√£o Paulo). He often appears at Jimmy Five's strips, irritating Jimmy with his insanity. In Portuguese, Nutty Ned always calls him \\"Cenourinha\\" (Little Carrot, in confusion with his Portuguese name \\"Cebolinha\\", literally, \\"Little Onion\\"). His strips are meant to be nonsensical and surreal, where Nutty Ned breaks the laws of physics. His crazy actions are often based on funny word plays and/or puns, and confusions caused by Jimmy's incapability to pronounce the r letter.  Reception and Legacy  Just like Monica, Jimmy Five is considered one of the great icons of Brazilian comics, and sometimes is even more popular than Monica. In December 2010 a special issue called \\"Cebolinha 50 Anos\\", of which celebrated the 50 years of the character was published.http://www.universohq.com/reviews/cebolinha-50-anos/ In 2019, the footballer Everton Soares started to adhere to the nickname \\"Cebolinha\\" in honor of the character, Everton admitted to being a fan of Monica's Gang and was later presented with a art made by Mauricio de Sousa.https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/esportes/noticia/2019/06/virei-fa-diz- mauricio-de-sousa-sobre-everton-cebolinha-cjxakl6cs009q01pkq6a45s7z.html In 2018 a Graphic Novel focused only on Jimmy Five entitled \\"Cebolinha: Recupera√ß√£o\\" was published, having been made by the artist Gustavo Borges. The comics are very popular in Brazil and Portugal, the U.S. is the country closing the podium. A Jimmy Five vynil doll appears in the 2007 Australian horror film Black Water, the appearance of this doll in the film was unknown to many of the fans until 2020.

Rules and regulations Gaming control boards are usually responsible for promulgating rules and regulations that dictate how gaming activities are to be conducted within a jurisdiction. The rules and regulations stem from the jurisdiction's enabling act. Generally, the enabling act is passed by the legislature and sets forth the broad policy of the jurisdiction with regard to gaming; while the rules and regulations provide detailed requirements that must be satisfied by a gaming establishment, its owners, employees, and vendors. Typically, rules and regulations cover a broad range of activity, including licensing, accounting systems, rules of casino games, fair play, better security and auditing. Licensing Gaming control boards also have complete authority to grant or deny licenses to gaming establishments, their ownership, employees, and vendors. Generally, in order to obtain a license, an applicant must demonstrate that they possess good character, honesty and integrity. License application forms typically require detailed personal information. Based upon the type of license being sought, an applicant may also be required to disclose details regarding previous business relationships, employment history, criminal records, and financial stability. Generally, the gaming license application process and subsequent investigation is quite burdensome in comparison to the process of obtaining other government-issued licenses. The difficulty of the process is intended to dissuade participation by unsavory people and organized crime. Recently, in order to simplify the application process, various gaming control boards have collaborated on the design of \\"multi-jurisdictional\\" application forms. Persons or vendors who are involved in gaming in multiple jurisdictions may now complete one application form and submit copies to each jurisdiction. Enforcement In some cases, Gaming Control Boards are responsible for enforcing the rules and regulations that they create. In other cases, a separate body or a division of the Gaming Control Board carries out the enforcement function. Most Gaming Control Boards have full authority to hear and decide civil cases brought before them by the enforcement body and thus are considered quasi-judicial bodies.

Although the tribal nation also owns the casino, appointing an independent gaming control board to oversee regulatory activities provides tribal members with assurances that the casino is operated within expected standards and that tribal revenue is accurately collected and reported. Native American casinos are subject to the provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which is enforced by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC).

The parade is held on the first Sunday in June. Its main purpose is to create awareness of Philippine culture and to raise funds for charity projects in the Philippines and the United States.http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/18688617/philippine-independence- day-celebration-in-nyc Philippine Independence, as a celebration in America, has gained cultural awareness prominently after the 21st century began. Earlier generations of Filipino immigrants did not celebrate Philippine Independence in significant ways. Philippine Independence Day is widely celebrated among Filipinos in the United States and is now a major event for many Filipino Americans to rekindle their roots and heritage. Many areas where there are significant Filipinos American populations in the United States celebrate Philippine Independence in the month of June. The largest among Philippine Independence celebrations in the United States takes place in New York City every first Sunday of June. The Philippine Independence Day Parade in New York City attracts over 100,000 people. The 2020 Philippine Independence Day Parade in New York City will take place on June 7, 2020 at Madison Avenue, following the tradition of the celebration being on the first Sunday of June. Brief History A scene at the Philippine Independence Day Parade 2013 in Midtown Manhattan. Katipuneros at the Philippine Independence Day Parade in New York City. Together with the Filipino American community, the Philippine Consulate General in New York created the Philippine Independence Day Committee (PIDC) to commemorate the birth of Philippine Independence. Established in 1990 during Consul General Hermenegildo Garcia's term, PIDC is an ad hoc committee with a life cycle of one year. All consuls general would later become the honorary overall chairperson for the corresponding year. The position of overall chairperson is elected every year. The winner in the election will then appoint the rest of her/his executive committee. At first, the theme of each year's celebration is handed down from the Government of the Philippines in Manila. Later on, the overall chairperson chooses the theme for her/his term. The coat of arms of the Republic of the Philippines is the centerpiece of the PIDC logo and PIDC's official address is that of the Philippine Consulate in New York. Checks payable to PIDC are mailed to and received by the Philippine Consulate and handed over to PIDC. All PIDC meetings, with rare exceptions, are conducted at the Consulate. Crowd at the Philippine Independence Day Parade in New York City. The Philippine Independence Day celebration in the northeastern United States includes not only New York but also the twelve states under the jurisdiction of the Philippine Consulate General in New York, namely, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. Depending on the theme each year, the overall chairperson may expand and invite other areas to participate in PIDC's many activities. Traditionally held along Madison Avenue from 37th to 25th Streets in Manhattan, the climax of the preparation, the Philippine Independence Day Parade, Street Fair and Cultural Show, held on the first Sunday in June each year is the biggest celebration of Philippine Independence outside the Philippines. The Street Fair and Cultural Show take place on the east side of Madison Square Park. The festivities include a beauty, brains and talent contest that concludes in the Diwa ng Kalayaan (Spirit of Independence) Selection and Coronation Pageant and Gala, Philippine Independence Ball (the culminating festivity of the annual commemoration held on the Saturday after the first Sunday in June), An Evening with the Consul General, the Grand Marshal Gala, other fund raising activities, special cultural presentations and other events that may be initiated by the overall chairperson. The Philippine Consulate extends its support and guidance to the PIDC from inception to culmination of the annual event. It begins with the sending of invitations to community leaders to a general meeting, election of overall chairperson, and in the planning and execution of activities up to Appreciation Night where the Consul General awards certificates of appreciation to PIDC officers and members. Since 1993, there were calls for incorporation of PIDC. On September 8, 2001, with the election of the overall chairperson, the members of the Filipino American community were also given the chance to cast their vote on the incorporation of PIDC. Results showed that majority of Filipino Americans are in favor of incorporating PIDC. With paperwork and processing, an incorporated PIDC will take over the reins of the annual commemoration in 2003. Hence, 2002 was PIDC's last year under the auspices of the Consulate General of the Philippines, New York. The Philippine Independence Day Council, Inc. (PIDCI) was issued its certificate of incorporation on February 14, 2002 and the new corporation took over the planning, organizing, production, execution, direction and presentation of the annual New York commemoration of the anniversary of the declaration of Philippine Independence. Under the bylaws of PIDCI, the Philippine Consul General in New York remained as an honorary adviser and the commemorations were held \\"with the cooperation of the Consulate General of the Philippines\\". About The Parade Philippine-flag carriers at the 2006 Philippine Independence Day Parade on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The Philippine Independence Day Parade, like any major New York City parades, has a set schedule for its annual celebration. Its usual slot is the first Sunday of June. Since its inception in 1990, the parade has steadily garnered attention not only from the Filipino American community, also from the general population of the New York metropolitan area. The Philippine Independence Day Council, Inc., which was preceded by the ad-hoc community organization Philippine Independence Day Committee under the auspices of the Consulate General of the Philippines in New York, has been criticized for failing to invite prominent leaders and figures to join the annual event. Also, the council, and the committee before that, has been continuously called on to allow younger Filipinos and Filipino Americans to collaborate in organizing the Philippine Independence Day Parade as opposed to the usual older generation of Filipinos, who are members of the current organizing group. The annual parade also experiences protests from several Philippine civic and political groups. Other Parts Of The World=Passaic, Jersey City, New Jersey Several celebrations dedicated to Philippine Independence are done throughout the world. An example of this would be a smaller annual Philippine Independence Day Parade held in early June in Passaic, New Jersey. This parade is organized by a large Filipino and Filipino-American organization known as the Philippine Day Organizing Council (PDOC). Another major Philippine parade is held in New Jersey called the Philippine-American Friendship Day Parade in Jersey City, New Jersey, it is held every fourth Sunday of June to celebrate Philippine-American Friendship Day, which is July 4. The Philippine government declared July 4 every year as Philippine-American Friendship Day after the celebration of Philippine Independence Day was moved from July 4 to June 12. Toronto, Canada Toronto hosts an annual Philippine Independence Day Celebration. British Columbia, Canada British Columbia celebrates an annual Philippine Days Festival event at the Waterfront Park in North Vancouver. This 2-day festival, attended by some 25,000 Filipino Canadians and other cultural minorities, is usually held on the second weekend of June, and organized by the Metro Vancouver Philippine Arts and Culture Exposition Society (MVPACES). The highlight of the celebration happens on the second day where festivities begin with a flag raising ceremony at the City Hall of North Vancouver, then everyone proceeds to the Waterfront Park where a Park Parade starts the grand opening ceremony. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) escorts the Canadian Flag, while leading Filipino organizations take turn each year to bring in the Philippine flag for the mass singing of the two national anthems. All throughout the 2-day spectacle are stage presentations of traditional Philippine music and dance, a showcase of Filipino talents and entertainment, games, raffle prizes and kid's playland. Filipino cuisine and merchandise fill the park where Filipino Canadian families gather and celebrate. The City and District of North Vancouver play hosts to the event along with the Philippine Consulate General in Vancouver, British Columbia. San Francisco, California San Francisco celebrates Philippine Independence Day annually at Union Square.http://globalnation.inquirer.net/77997/filipinos-celebrate-philippine- independence-day-at-sfs-union-square The Philippine flag is raised at the San Francisco City Hall every June 12 as a commemoration of the event and for San Francisco's large Filipino community.http://globalnation.inquirer.net/39805/philippine-flag-flies-over- san-francisco-city-hall Seattle, Washington Seattle celebrates Philippine Independence Day through the \\"Pagdiriwang Festival,\\" held every June at the Seattle Center.http://www.festalpagdiriwang.com/ Passaic, New Jersey A smaller annual Philippine Independence Day parade is held in early June in Passaic, New Jersey. Past issues=Registration and Delinquent Financial Reports By letter dated April 12, 2006, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (OAG), cancelled the Philippine Independence Day Council, Inc.'s (PIDCI) registration to solicit contributions. The OAG's Charities Bureau Registry found that PIDCI had been delinquent in filing annual financial reports for 2003, 2004, and 2005, and gave PIDCI until May 12, 2006 to re-register, file all delinquent reports, pay delinquent fees, and remit a re-registration fee of $150. The PIDCI Presidents for the years in question were Reuben Seguritan, Esq., Rogelio Alama, and Nimia Lacebal, respectively; while the Overall Chairpersons for those years were Nena Kaufman, Lolit Gillberg, and Nimia Lacebal, respectively. The OAG's action may affect PIDCI's fundraising and planning for the 2006 Philippine Independence Day Parade scheduled for June 4. Days after the OAG's letter, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office (\\"New Jersey AG\\") informed PIDCI by letter dated April 26, 2006 that it had to register with the New Jersey AG's Charities Registration & Investigation Unit if PIDCI planned to hold charitable events and solicit funds in New Jersey. The New Jersey AG's Office gave PIDCI until May 11 to comply.  Alleged Discrimination Against Attendees of the 2018 NYC Philippine Independence Day Parade  New York City rejected a formal complaint of discrimination and found no violation of the City zoning code when attendees of the June 3, 2018 Philippine Independence day parade were cleared from a designated New York City Madison Avenue public plaza on the parade route. The public plaza was then barricaded, patrolled by building security and access denied to the parade crowd. New York City officials, in rejecting the complaints filed by witnesses, offered no explanation why the largely Filipino crowd could not sit or stand in the public plaza which is designated to be open 24 hours for public use.

Nestled in the Rocky Mountain foothills, the town is located 113 miles (180 km) NW of Fort St. John and 140 miles (224 km) NW of Dawson Creek, on Mile 143 of the Alaska Highway. Approximately 100 people inhabit the community. Only part of the mountain itself, aptly named after the pinkish burnt rock seams which it is locally famed for, has been designated provincial park status. Located 10 miles (16 km) south-west of Mile 147, Pink Mountain Provincial Park is one of the region's designated areas for wildlife. However, because much of the park area is on a fairly steep slope, it is only sparsely covered with vegetation and is not suitable butterfly habitat. Prime butterfly habitat for the rare arctic butterflies in the southernmost part of their range is threatened by the proposed development of a wind farm with its large concrete footprint. The park's primary role is to protect a significant palaeontological site containing examples of large marine fossils from the Mesozoic Era, including the largest ichthyosaur ever discovered. Pink Mountain is also the only place in the province where wild plains bison roam. The 1000 plus bison found roaming the area are not naturally occurring, but rather descendants of an escaped herd of 50 from those imported by local guide and outfitter R. Lynn Ross in 1968.

As an \\"all- through\\" school, it is a member of both the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the Independent Association of Preparatory Schools. It is also a founding member of the Bishop‚Äôs Stortford Educational Trust, a consortium of local primary and secondary schools, and currently the only such trust in the UK to involve both state and independent sectors. The college head is Kathy Crewe-Read. History The College was founded in 1868 by a group of prominent East Anglian Nonconformists who wanted to establish a public school ‚Äúin which Evangelical Nonconformists might secure for their boys, an effective and Christian education on terms that should not be beyond the reach of the middle class generally\\". They approached the Bishop's Stortford Collegiate School, a non-sectarian school founded in 1850, and acquired the buildings, renaming it The Nonconformist Grammar School. It was inaugurated on 23 September 1868, with 40 pupils, including 17 boarders, under the headship of Rev Richard Alliott, who remained at the helm until his death in 1899. Former star pupil Francis Young became second headmaster, in 1900. During his 31-year tenure the roll increased from just 90 pupils to nearly 400 and the school grew in reputation. Among Young's first acts were: renaming it the Bishop's Stortford College in 1901, to avoid confusion with the town's rival Grammar School; in 1902 taking over an existing school for boys aged 8‚Äì13 years, which became the new preparatory department; in 1903 introducing rugby; and in 1904 changing the school's status from private commercial ownership to publicly endowed. He also commissioned many of the campus's redbrick buildings designed in the arts and crafts style by architect and former pupil Herbert Ibberson, acquired the 100 acre sports fields and oversaw construction of the Memorial Hall, commemorating the Stortfordians who had lost their lives in the Great War. The College changed status in 1945, from a direct grant school to fully independent public school. It celebrated its centenary in 1968 with a major building programme and a visit by HRH Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, followed in 1969 with a book, Bishop‚Äôs Stortford College: A Centenary Chronicle. September 1977 saw the first four girls admitted, and the following year the first girls‚Äô house, Young, opened. In 1995 the College became fully coeducational, appointed its first female deputy head, Wendy Bellars, and opened a new co-ed Pre-Prep day school. Since 2013 large parts of the College have been substantially redeveloped and expanded, including new premises for Alliott, Collett, Trotman and Rowe Houses, and an extension to the Prep School (during which workers excavated 2.5 tonnes of Hertfordshire puddingstone, one of the rarest rocks). In the early hours of September 29, 2015, Robert Pearce boarding house was devastated by fire. Pupils and staff were evacuated safely but the building lost its roof and burned down to the bricks. It was renovated and reopened in January 2018, in time for the College's 150th anniversary, which was commemorated in the book, Bishop's Stortford College: Celebrating 150 Years 1868-2018. On September 1 2020, Kathy Crewe-Read, formerly head of Wolverhampton Grammar School, became the first woman to lead the school and only the tenth head in its 152-year history.  College heads  In its first 100 years, the College had only five headmasters. * 1868‚Äì1899: Rev Richard Alliott * 1900‚Äì1931: Francis S Young * 1932‚Äì1943: H Leo Price * 1944‚Äì1957: AN Evans * 1957‚Äì1970: Peter Rowe * 1970‚Äì1984: Colin Greetham * 1984‚Äì1997: Steven Benson * 1997‚Äì2011: John Trotman * 2011‚Äì2020: Jeremy Gladwin * 2020-present: Kathy Crewe-Read  Present day  There are 1173 pupils at Bishop's Stortford College: 594 in the Senior School (aged 13‚Äì18), including 248 in the Sixth Form, 456 in the Prep School (aged 7‚Äì13) and 123 in Pre-Prep (aged 4‚Äì7). Pupils board from the age of seven. The Senior School has 160 boarders, including full, weekly and part-time; the Prep School has 47 full, weekly or flexi-boarders. Most UK boarders come from Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex and London, while most international boarders are Senior School pupils. In 2020, the College produced its best-ever GCSE results, with 79% of all grades at 9-7 (up from 76% in 2019). At A Level, students achieved a 100% pass rate in 2020, with 86% of results graded A*-B and 62% at A*-A. Most students go on to study at Russell Group universities, including Oxford and Cambridge. The latest ISI Education Quality Inspection report, published in March 2017, found that \\"the quality of the pupils' academic and other achievements is excellent\\", with pupils displaying \\"excellent attitudes towards their learning and highly developed study skills\\". The report also stated that \\"the school is highly successful in creating an ethic of hard work and enthusiastic participation\\". The College maintains a Christian ethos but promotes matters of faith from a non-denominational perspective that is sensitive towards pupils of other faiths and none. Morning assemblies are led by the head and the school chaplain, with an evening service for boarders every Sunday and a weekly prayer breakfast for staff on Wednesday mornings. Since 2009 it has hosted an annual Festival of Literature, which is open to the public and includes events for local primary schools. Speakers and performers have included Poet Laureate Simon Armitage, former Children‚Äôs Laureate Anthony Browne, broadcasters Robin Ince and Michael Portillo, author and illustrator James Mayhew, art critic Andrew Graham-Dixon and the bestselling novelist Rachel Joyce.  Houses  The College has 14 houses, all named after prominent figures in its history. Each of the six, single-sex day houses in the Senior School is in the care of a housemaster or housemistress, while the five boarding houses all have resident house parents, a resident assistant and other resident staff. Prep School pupils are split into four houses for competitions: Monk-Jones, Newbury, Westfield and Grimwade, but the latter is the only bricks and mortar house and is home to the boarders. The Senior School has five houses for boys ‚Äì Collett, Hayward and Sutton for day boys, and Robert Pearce and Rowe for boys' boarding; and five houses for girls ‚Äì Alliott, Benson and Tee for day girls, and Trotman and Young for girls' boarding.  College facilities  The FS Young Library was built in 1936 as a permanent memorial to FS Young, College headmaster from 1900‚Äì1931. Since 1992 it has been run by qualified librarians and is fully supervised for 70 hours a week to provide research and study facilities and assistance for pupils and staff. It is also home to an extensive archive of College records, publications, photographs, cuttings, and memorabilia including old uniforms from the College‚Äôs early days. Sports facilities include a sports hall, fitness centre and indoor swimming pool, officially opened in 2002 by Olympian Duncan Goodhew. The playing fields cover more than 100 acres, including 12 rugby pitches, seven cricket squares and 16 cricket nets, three grass hockey pitches, five football pitches and a grass running track. There are also two floodlit AstroTurf pitches for tennis and hockey, all-weather surface courts for netball and tennis and a multi-use games area. The College has been included in The Cricketer magazine's guide to cricket‚Äôs top 100 schools in England since 2017. In 2020 it became an MCC Foundation Cricket Hub, providing free cricketing facilities and coaching to state-educated young cricketers. The Grade II listed Memorial Hall has been used for assemblies, concerts and special events since it was formally opened in 1922 by Sir Arthur Quiller- Couch. Designed by architect Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis (creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales), it was built to commemorate the 62 former college members who had lost their lives in the First World War. The doors were given in memory of EA Knight, a popular master killed on active service in Belgium in 1917. A second Roll of Honour was added in 1949, inscribed with the names of a further 92 former students who lost their lives while serving in the Second World War. The Ferguson Building, opened in 2007 and named after Old Stortfordian Professor John Ferguson, who was a founding member of the Open University, provides a lecture theatre for up to 180 people, meeting room, ICT suite and sixth form social centre. It is built on the site of the old indoor swimming pool and retains some of its original features. It hosts the Ferguson Lectures, which focus on contemporary issues and are open to the public; speakers have included former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams; Jason Cowley, editor of the New Statesman; Brendan Simms, Professor of History of International Relations at Peterhouse, Cambridge; Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales; the late Tony Benn, politician; and writer and historian Tom Holland. Other facilities include the purpose-built Charles Edwards Centre, which houses ICT, physics and design and technology, and the Walter Strachan Art Centre, which has a sculpture studio, workshop, gallery space, IT suite, sixth form studio and departmental library.

GLUT4 is the insulin-regulated glucose transporter found primarily in adipose tissues and striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac). The first evidence for this distinct glucose transport protein was provided by David James in 1988. The gene that encodes GLUT4 was cloned and mapped in 1989. At the cell surface, GLUT4 permits the facilitated diffusion of circulating glucose down its concentration gradient into muscle and fat cells. Once within cells, glucose is rapidly phosphorylated by glucokinase in the liver and hexokinase in other tissues to form glucose-6-phosphate, which then enters glycolysis or is polymerized into glycogen. Glucose-6-phosphate cannot diffuse back out of cells, which also serves to maintain the concentration gradient for glucose to passively enter cells.  Structure  UBX-domain. These are ubiquitin-regulatory regions that can assist with cell signaling. Like all proteins, the unique amino acid arrangement in the primary sequence of GLUT4 is what allows it to transport glucose across the plasma membrane. In addition to the phenylalanine on the N-terminus, two Leucine residues and acidic motifs on the COOH-terminus are believed to play a key role in the kinetics of endocytosis and exocytosis.  Other GLUT proteins  There are 14 total GLUT proteins separated into 3 classes based on sequence similarities. Class 1 consists of GLUT 1-4 and 14, class 2 contains GLUT 5, 7, 9 and 11, and class 3 has GLUT 6, 8, 10, 12 and 13. Although there are some sequence differences between all GLUT proteins, they all have some basic structural components. For example, both the N and C termini in GLUT proteins are exposed to the cytoplasm of the cell, and they all have 12 transmembrane segments.  Tissue distribution = Skeletal muscle  As muscles contract, they use ATP. The energy needed to make ATP comes from a variety of different pathways‚Äîsuch as glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation‚Äîthat ultimately use glucose as a starting material. In striated skeletal muscle cells, GLUT4 concentration in the plasma membrane can increase as a result of either exercise or muscle contraction. During exercise, the body needs to convert glucose to ATP to be used as energy. As G-6-P concentrations decrease, hexokinase becomes less inhibited, and the glycolytic and oxidative pathways that make ATP are able to proceed. This also means that muscle cells are able to take in more glucose as its intracellular concentrations decrease. In order to increase glucose levels in the cell, GLUT4 is the primary transporter used in this facilitated diffusion. Although muscle contractions function in a similar way and also induce the translocation of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane, the two skeletal muscle processes obtain different forms of intracellular GLUT4. The GLUT4 carrier vesicles are either transferrin positive or negative, and are recruited by different stimuli. Transferrin- positive GLUT4 vesicles are utilized during muscle contraction while the transferrin-negative vesicles are activated by insulin stimulation as well as by exercise.  Cardiac muscle  Cardiac muscle is slightly different from skeletal muscle. At rest, they prefer to utilize fatty acids as their main energy source. As activity increases and it begins to pump faster, the cardiac muscles begin to oxidize glucose at a higher rate. An analysis of mRNA levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in cardiac muscles show that GLUT1 plays a larger role in cardiac muscles than it does in skeletal muscles. GLUT4, however, is still believed to be the primary transporter for glucose. Much like in other tissues, GLUT4 also responds to insulin signaling, and is transported into the plasma membrane to facilitate the diffusion of glucose into the cell.  Adipose tissue  Adipose tissue, commonly known as fat, is a depository for energy in order to conserve metabolic homeostasis. As the body takes in energy in the form of glucose, some is expended, and the rest is stored as glycogen (primarily in the liver, muscle cells), or as triglyceride in adipose tissue. An imbalance in glucose intake and energy expenditure has been shown to lead to both adipose cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which lead to obesity. In addition, mutations in GLUT4 genes in adipocytes can also lead to increased GLUT4 expression in adipose cells, which allows for increased glucose uptake and therefore more fat stored. If GLUT4 is over-expressed, it can actually alter nutrient distribution and send excess glucose into adipose tissue, leading to increased adipose tissue mass.  Regulation =Insulin Insulin is released from the pancreas and into the bloodstream in response to increased glucose concentration in the blood. Insulin is stored in beta cells in the pancreas. When glucose in the blood binds to glucose receptors on the beta cell membrane, a signal cascade is initiated inside the cell that results in insulin stored in vesicles in these cells being released into the blood stream. Increased insulin levels cause the uptake of glucose into the cells. GLUT4 is stored in the cell in transport vesicles, and is quickly incorporated into the plasma membrane of the cell when insulin binds to membrane receptors. Under conditions of low insulin, most GLUT4 is sequestered in intracellular vesicles in muscle and fat cells. As the vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, GLUT4 transporters are inserted and become available for transporting glucose, and glucose absorption increases. The genetically engineered muscle insulin receptor knock‚Äêout (MIRKO) mouse was designed to be insensitive to glucose uptake caused by insulin, meaning that GLUT4 is absent. Mice with diabetes or fasting hyperglycemia, however, were found to be immune to the negative effects of the insensitivity. The insulin signal transduction pathway begins when insulin binds to the insulin receptor proteins. Once the transduction pathway is completed, the GLUT-4 storage vesicles becomes one with the cellular membrane. As a result, the GLUT-4 protein channels become embedded into the membrane, allowing glucose to be transported into the cell. The mechanism for GLUT4 is an example of a cascade effect, where binding of a ligand to a membrane receptor amplifies the signal and causes a cellular response. In this case, insulin binds to the insulin receptor in its dimeric form and activates the receptor's tyrosine-kinase domain. The receptor then recruits Insulin Receptor Substrate, or IRS-1, which binds the enzyme PI-3 kinase. PI-3 kinase converts the membrane lipid PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3 is specifically recognized by PKB (protein kinase B) and by PDK1, which can phosphorylate and activate PKB. Once phosphorylated, PKB is in its active form and phosphorylates TBC1D4, which inhibits the GTPase-activating domain associated with TBC1D4, allowing for Rab protein to change from its GDP to GTP bound state. Inhibition of the GTPase-activating domain leaves proteins next in the cascade in their active form, and stimulates GLUT4 to be expressed on the plasma membrane. RAC1 is a GTPase also activated by insulin. Rac1 stimulates reorganization of the cortical Actin cytoskeleton which allows for the GLUT4 vesicles to be inserted into the plasma membrane. A RAC1 Knockout mouse has reduced glucose uptake in muscle tissue. Knockout mice that are heterozygous for GLUT4 develop insulin resistance in their muscles as well as diabetes. Muscle contraction Muscle contraction stimulates muscle cells to translocate GLUT4 receptors to their surfaces. This is especially true in cardiac muscle, where continuous contraction increases the rate of GLUT4 translocation; but is observed to a lesser extent in increased skeletal muscle contraction. In skeletal muscle, muscle contractions increase GLUT4 translocation several fold, and this is likely regulated by RAC1 and AMP- activated protein kinase. Muscle stretching Muscle stretching also stimulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in rodent muscle via RAC1.  Interactions  GLUT4 has been shown to interact with death-associated protein 6, also known as Daxx. Daxx, which is used to regulate apoptosis, has been shown to associate with GLUT4 in the cytoplasm. UBX-domains, such as the one found in GLUT4, have been shown to associate with apoptotic signaling. So this interaction aids in the translocation of Daxx within the cell. In addition, recent reports demonstrated the presence of GLUT4 gene in central nervous system such as the hippocampus. Moreover, impairment in insulin- stimulated trafficking of GLUT4 in the hippocampus result in decreased metabolic activities and plasticity of hippocampal neurons, which leads to depressive like behaviour and cognitive dysfunction.

South Carolina state senator Thomas Drayton was the president of the railroad from its earliest planning stages in 1853 until 1856. During the Civil War, control of the railroad was vital to the protection of Savannah and keeping nearby Confederate troops supplied with food and materiel. In December 1864, during his March to the Sea, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman sent part of his Union forces forward to cut the line, which would force Confederate general William Hardee to retreat and abandon Savannah. The mission failed, but sections of the railroad would be severely damaged during Sherman's subsequent 1865 Carolinas Campaign.The December 6-9th Demonstrations for the Charleston and Savannah Railroad Following the war, the railroad was reorganized in 1866 as the Savannah and Charleston Railroad but did not complete repairs and reopen for traffic as a line until 1869-70.

It is typically made with the steam wand of an espresso machine, which pumps steam into a pitcher of milk. The opposite of microfoam is macrofoam (also called dry foam, in contrast to the wet foam of microfoam), which has visibly large bubbles, a style of milk commonly used for cappuccinos.  Characteristics  Microfoam is shiny, slightly thickened, and should have microscopic, uniform bubbles. It is not as viscous or \\"foamy\\" as macrofoam\\"Barista Technique:Frothing Milk\\", home- barista.com ‚Äì it is better described as \\"gooey\\" and resembles melted marshmallows or wet paint. There have been a variety of names used for this ideal standard, such as \\"microfoam\\", \\"velvet milk\\",\\"Latte Art 101\\" , espressovivace.com \\"microbubbles\\", and so forth.  Applications  Microfoam is primarily used for making latte art, such as this rosette. The decorative application of microfoam is called latte art, which involves making patterns in espresso-based drinks. Microfoam is essential for this as the microscopic bubbles give definition and stability to the patterns, which are harder to achieve with macrofoam which disperses more readily. Latte art is traditionally associated with lattes, as the name suggests, but can also be used in cappuccinos and other drinks. A cappuccino made with microfoam is sometimes called a \\"wet\\" cappuccino. However, cappuccinos typically use thicker macrofoam, with a layer of dry foam floating on the top of the drink. Latte macchiato is another drink which generally has separate layers of dry foam and liquid milk, but microfoam is occasionally used instead. Microfoam may also be added to brewed coffee in a caf√© au lait, and faint latte art can be produced. Microfoam may also be used in a steamer (a \\"coffee-free\\" cappuccino), though this can instead be made with dry foam. As it requires a skilled barista to produce microfoam (especially when used for latte art), it is a sign of attention to quality, and a defining characteristic of the third wave of coffee.  Procedure  Milk being steamed. This milk would be too \\"foamy\\" for latte art, due to too much air (large bubbles) and the air not being sufficiently mixed into the milk. Microfoam is usually created with the steam wand of an espresso machine. This is the quickest method and provides precise control over the timing and depth of air injection. Alternative methods are rarely as effective for producing microfoam, but some are acceptable for macrofoam. These include whisking, shaking, and hand pumps. Dedicated electric milk frothers may also be used, usually consisting of a motorized whisk.http://wisegeek.org/what-is-a-milk-frother.htm When using a steam wand, the volume and type of foam is controlled by the barista during the steaming process,\\"Steaming with Prosumer Machines\\", Coffee Geek and loosely follows these steps: # Air is introduced from the steam wand by immersing only the tip of the wand in the milk. This process is sometimes known as frothing, stretching, or surfing, and usually lasts less than 10 seconds. After the creation of small bubbles, the milk is covered with a soft foam phase which separates from the liquid and floats on top of the milk. # The second stage involves mixing the incorporated air throughout the milk (mixing or texturing), which is achieved by immersing the steam wand more deeply (typically 20‚Äì30 mm). This creates a turbulent vortex or \\"whirlpool\\" in the vessel. This step is necessary to integrate the foam which naturally separates from the liquid phase. During this stage, the milk is also heated to about , at which point the steaming is finished. # Lastly, the milk is poured from the pitcher into a cup, usually already containing espresso. Methods for pouring vary widely depending on the type of drink and personal technique . In a \\"dry\\" variation of a cappuccino, the foam is light (high air-to-milk ratio) and floats on top on the espresso. Latte art requires heavier, \\"wetter\\" foam.  Notable variations  The details of the above method vary between baristas, and are influenced by the machine and the desired outcome. * It is common to briefly switch on the steam wand before using it, in order to flush any condensed water from the plumbing and preheat the steam wand itself. The same is often done after steaming milk, to remove milk residue. * On machines with pivoting steam wands, the wand should be between 10¬∞ and 30¬∞ from vertical. However, some baristas tilt the jug relative to the steam wand, whilst keeping the wand almost vertical. * If milk has been over-aerated (i.e. the froth is too thick), it may be groomed by running the tip of a spoon through it. * As a supplementary method of mixing, a barista may swirl the pitcher just before pouring it. This method is also used to assess whether grooming is necessary (see above), and is intended to delay separation of the milk. * In order to remove any large bubbles from the surface, some baristas tap the jug on a bench before pouring * Occasionally a barista may use less- than-full pressure from the steam wand, if they are steaming a very small amount of milk (variable pressure is usually only a feature on professional machines)  Chemical and physical properties  An example of properly steamed milk, considered ideal to pour latte art. The basic requirements for formation of foam are an abundance of gas, water, a surfactant, and energy. The steam wand of an espresso machine supplies energy, in the form of heat, and gas, in the form of steam. The other two components, water and surfactants, are naturally occurring ingredients of milk. Varying the balance of these factors affects the size of bubbles, the foam dissipation rate, and the volume of foam. Microfoam may be represented simply as a metastable liquid-gas colloid of milk and air, consisting of gaseous bubbles suspended in the liquid milk. In reality, the suspension is more complex because milk consists of two different colloids itself - an emulsion of fat and a sol of protein. In fact, these two colloids are what enable milk to form such a mechanically strong foam which does not collapse under its own weight. The interaction between fat and air creates a structure of microscopic bubbles strong enough to support itself, and even be submerged (i.e. suspended within the liquid milk).  Interaction of fat and protein  Like in whipped cream, air bubbles are initially stabilized by the protein Œ≤-casein, prior to their adsorption of fat. This adsorption causes destabilization of the bubbles, because the fat molecules are amphiphilic (i.e. they have polar and non-polar ends), competing with protein molecules which are more conducive to bubbles. The denaturation of milk fat occurs around , so milk at higher temperatures is not significantly affected by this problem. At higher temperatures, the protein Œ≤-lactoglobulin enables the foam to maintain its structure and is the prime factor in the formation of foam. This can be show trivially by adding various quantities of skim milk powder which contains a high concentration of Œ≤-lactoglobulin. Since fat reduces the likelihood of bonding at the surface of bubbles, it follows that fat content in milk is inversely proportional to its frothing potential. Whilst this is true, an excessive fat constituent also enables larger bubbles, leading to macrofoam rather than microfoam. As a result, most baristas prefer to use whole milk rather than skim milk, due to its tendency to form smaller, more homogeneous bubbles. Microfoam is unstable, decomposing into a layer of \\"dry\\" foam over a layer of liquid milk, as in this latte macchiato.  Effect of temperature  Several studies have confirmed that the foamability of pasteurized whole milk, measured by the volume of foam produced, reaches a minimum at . This value is higher for raw milk - around . The dip in foamability occurs due to fat globules consisting of both solid and liquid phases at this temperature. Solid fat crystals in a globule may penetrate the film which separates them from the surrounding air, causing spreading of the membrane material which is then adsorbed onto air bubbles. At temperatures above the minimum foamability temperature, the volume of foam steadily increases, which has been attributed to the trends of decreasing viscosity and surface tension with temperature. If milk is heated above , it becomes scalded and its texture is compromised. Microfoam cannot exist in overheated milk due to the missing tertiary structure in the protein. When milk is scalded, the suspended protein casein becomes denatured and cannot maintain the intermolecular bonds necessary for microfoam. The stability of milk foam, measured by the half-life of its volume, is also greatly influenced by temperature. For pasteurized whole milk, stability increases with temperature up to about , then rises steeply until , where it starts steadily decreasing. Skim milk generally produces more stable foam, owing to its lower concentration of micellar casein. For regular pasteurized, homogenized whole milk, steamed at , the half-life is roughly 150 minutes. However, microfoam tends to separate into layers more quickly than it reduces in volume, so baristas usually steam milk immediately before serving it. This is especially important when serving latte art which may degrade within minutes.

Background Carmen grew up in Torrens Park in Adelaide and attended Unley High School. His father died when he was fourteen. Carmen married at age 20, however the marriage ended in divorce. He played keyboard in various bands including Red Angel Panic, and has had a number of jobs, including: public servant, taxi-driver, and fruit- picker. In around 1995, Carmen moved to Sydney. My Own Sweet Time In 1994 the Aboriginal publishing house Magabala Books published My Own Sweet Time, supposedly a biographical account by the author Wanda Koolmatrie‚Äîan aboriginal woman born to the Pitjantjatjara people in 1949. The book details how Koolmatrie was taken from her mother in 1950 to be raised by white foster parents, and thus became one of the Stolen Generations. In 1996 the author received the Dobbie Literary Award for the work. When Koolmatrie offered Magabala a sequel to the book in 1997, the publisher discovered the hoax and the affair was made public. The fact that \\"Koolmatrie\\" turned out to be a white Australian taxi driver named Leon Carmen turned into a \\"national scandal\\". In a later interview, Carmen said that he was trying to break into the literary market and believed he could not have got his book published without the subterfuge. Carmen states that his friend and agent, John Bayley, was aware of the plan to write the work under a pseudonym, and helped to select the novel's title. In 1997, a \\"Brief of Evidence\\" regarding \\"the 'Wanda' Case\\" was compiled by the NSW Police against John Bayley. In 2004 Bayley published a book about the affair, titled: Daylight corroboree : a first-hand account of the \\"Wanda Koolmatrie\\" hoax. The first edition of the work included supportive quotes (on the rear cover) from the Australian author Dorothy Hewett and from the Australian academic and author Philip Morrissey. The work was included in an anthology of Australian autobiography, and was used as a text for the NSW Higher School Certificate examination.

It was established in 1939 as a result of a special act of the Connecticut General Assembly in 1937. It is the first regional high school in New England.  History  Prior to the opening of Housatonic Valley Regional High School, four of the six towns it currently serves each had its own high school. In the 1920s, William Teague, the state's rural supervisor of schools, suggested that Connecticut's sprawling Northwest Corner consolidate its public schools. In 1937, the Connecticut General Assembly authorized the formation of the first regional school district in the state (hence the name of the new district, \\"Regional School District Number One\\"). The newly formed board of education purchased the former Lorch farm at the junction of the Salmon Kill and the Housatonic River near the Canaan- Salisbury town line for $8,000. The school was subsequently constructed on that site, opening in the fall of 1939. In 2001, the school facility expanded; adding a new agricultural education center, library, and updated science labs. The school facility includes one gymnasium, an auditorium, a cafeteria and dozens of classrooms. The school sat under the shadow of a white oak, from which the yearbook The White Oak takes its name. The historic White Oak was so badly damaged in a storm on Monday, July 5, 2004, shortly after the arrival of previous principal Dr. Gretchen Foster, that it was taken down.Waterbury Republican-American, 7 July 2004 The School also has two other courtyards: the Sophomore Courtyard located near the cafeteria, and the Faculty Courtyard (formerly Freshman courtyard). In 2007, HVRHS became the North American Champions of the Canon Envirothon competition.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_n19396264 In early 2008, a plan was unveiled to renovate the former Clarke B. Wood Agricultural Center on campus. Part of that building, closed in 2001 after construction of a new Agriculture Center, has been turned into the artgarage, an afterschool activity center. The main part of that building was renovated into the Mahoney-Hewat Science and Technology Center, containing areas for extended curriculum activities needing more space than in the school's science laboratories and includes permanent space for the high school's robotics team (FIRST # 716), electric vehicle construction, a conference room with space for the Alumni Association activities, a business office for the 21st Century organization and various displays and supplies. The renovations were completed late 2012 and will serve not only high school students but all the CT Region One School District schools and students.  Curriculum  In addition to the standard high school curricula, the school offers a variety of elective classes including drawing, color and design, painting, photography, pottery, sculpture, wood technology, metal technology, drafting, and a wide array of courses in agriculture.  Athletics  Housatonic supports a large number of sports in comparison to other schools in its league. Housatonic has earned three state championships; Girls Track (1985 and 1988) and Division IX Golf (2007). Its notable alumni to continue on to professional sports careers are John Lamb and Steve Blass, both Major League Baseball pitchers for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Blass was drafted out of HVRHS, and pitched in the 1971 World Series. He is currently a sportscaster for the Pirates. The Housatonic mascot is The Mountaineer. The school's colors are royal blue and gold, and it is a member of the Berkshire League (it is a member of the Pequot Uncas for football).

The only Japanese person to be hanged for treason (under the guise of the Peace Preservation Law) by the Japanese government during World War II, Ozaki is well known as an informant of the Soviet agent Richard Sorge. Biography Ozaki was born in what is now the town of Shirakawa, Gifu Prefecture, and a descendant of a samurai family. His family relocated to Taiwan when he was a youth, and he grew up in Taipei. Growing up in Taiwan left Ozaki with a deep respect and affection for Chinese culture, and was very fond of the island, where he spent his childhood.Johnson, Chambers An Instance of Treason, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990 page 25. Ozaki's father worked for the Japanese colonial government and taught his son that as Japan was the most advanced of the Asian nations it had a special \\"civilizing mission\\" - not only in Taiwan, but in all of Asia.Johnson, Chambers An Instance of Treason, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990 page 24. Ozaki was brought up bilingual, and had an education steeped in the classics of both Japanese and Chinese literature in order to better understand China. Ozaki was opposed to the crude anti-Chinese racism of the Japanese ultra-nationalists, who saw the Chinese as a people fit only to be slaves, which led him to an increasing estrangement from his country as time went on.Johnson, Chambers An Instance of Treason, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990 page 15. He returned to Japan in 1922, and enrolled in the Legal department of Tokyo Imperial University. Appalled by the actions of the government in the aftermath of the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake he turned to Marxism. In the aftermath of the Great Kant≈ç earthquake, members of the extreme right-wing groups began vigilante killings of ethnic Koreans and leftists, as supposedly the Koreans and left-wingers were engaging in looting, which the police did nothing to stop.Johnson, Chambers An Instance of Treason, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990 page 28 Ozaki was greatly upset at the way that the police tolerated these killings. He left school without graduating in 1925, after becoming involved in the activities of the Japanese Communist Party. In 1926, he joined the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, where he wrote articles on Soviet leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. He was transferred to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun the following year. From November 1928, Ozaki was dispatched to Shanghai in China. Ozaki arrived in Shanghai believing that it was Britain that had a parasitical economic relationship with China, and the Chinese nationalist movement was largely anti-British.Johnson, Chambers An Instance of Treason, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990 page 46. It was a great shock to him to hear Chinese demonstrators shout \\"Expel Japan!\\" and \\"Boycott Japanese goods!\\". In Shanghai Ozaki soon made contact with members of the Chinese Communist Party, the left-wing journalist Agnes Smedley, and members of the Comintern leadership based in Shanghai. Smedley introduced him to Richard Sorge in 1930. In his newspaper articles, Ozaki showed himself very sympathetic towards Chinese nationalism and the struggle to undo the \\"unequal treaties\\".Johnson, Chambers An Instance of Treason Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990 page 49. In 1932, Ozaki covered the First Battle of Shanghai, and was shocked to see Japanese soldiers execute Chinese POWs on the streets of Shanghai on the grounds that Chinese were mere \\"ants\\", not human beings, an event that deeply traumatized him.Johnson, Chambers An Instance of Treason, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990 page 10. After his return to Japan, he moved back to Tokyo in 1934 where he linked up with Sorge. By writing books and articles Ozaki established himself as an expert in Sino- Japanese relations. Thus he was recruited by Ry≈´nosuke Got≈ç in 1937 to join the Sh≈çwa Kenky≈´kai, a think tank established by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. From 1938, he was invited by Konoe to become a member of his inner circle, or \\"Breakfast Club\\", of select members with whom he would confer on current events each week over breakfast. Ozaki, therefore, was in a position to participate in the making of decisions he was supposed to uncover. Ozaki learned that Japan wanted to avoid a war with the Soviet Union, and let Sorge know of it. This information proved to be of uttermost importance for the whole history of the Second World War: after Sorge relayed it to Soviet command, Moscow transferred 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East to the Western Front against the Nazi Germany during the most dangerous months of the Battle for Moscow, one of the turning points of the whole war. On July 2, 1941, Ozaki as a member of the \\"Breakfast Club\\" supported a critical decision for Japanese expansion towards the Dutch East Indies and Singapore and against Hitler's request to invade Siberia. He was outspoken in his opposition and concerns with regards to the decision reached at the Gozen Kaigi conference of September 6, 1941 that war with the United States was unavoidable. On October 15, 1941, Ozaki was arrested in conjunction with the Sorge Incident. During his trial, it was revealed that Ozaki had been working with Sorge since his return to Japan, and that through his close contacts with Konoe and other senior Japanese politicians, was able to gather information and to copy secret documents. He was executed on 7 November 1944. In 1946, a collection of letters that Ozaki wrote to his wife from prison explaining why he betrayed his country, become a best-seller in Japan.Johnson, Chambers An Instance of Treason, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990 page 2. Post-war  After the war, Hotsumi Ozaki became viewed as a martyr. In the arts *No Regrets for Our Youth is a Japanese film loosely based on Ozaki, written and directed by Akira Kurosawa. *In the 2003 film Spy Sorge, directed by Masahiro Shinoda and based on the life of Richard Sorge, Ozaki is played by Masahiro Motoki. *Kinoshita Junji, A Japanese Called Otto „Ç™„ÉÉ„Éà„Éº„Å®Âëº„Å∞„Çå„ÇãÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫.

It is a bright white bird with black wings and a distinctive small bright yellow eye patch. The IUCN has rated it as a \\"least-concern species\\". Taxonomy The species was first described as Melanerpes candidus in 1796 by the French naturalist Bernhard Christian Otto, the type locality being Cayenne. It is sometimes placed in its own genus Leuconerpes, but shows many similarities in morphology to Melanerpes. No subspecies are known (monotypic). Description White woodpecker at Weltvogelpark Walsrode, Germany This woodpecker grows to a length of . The mantle, back, wings and tail of the adult are black, the flight feathers being brownish-black above and the underside of the wings being greyish-black. The crown, face, rump and underparts are white, sometimes with some buff shading. The male has some yellowing of the breast and nape which the female lacks, and both sexes have a certain amount of yellow on the belly. A narrow black stripe runs from behind the eye to the nape. There is a bare ring of yellow skin around the eye which has a yellowish iris. The beak is long and grey, paler near the base, and the legs are grey. Juveniles are browner and less glossy than the adults, with the pale areas being buff rather than white. The orbital ring on juveniles is grey rather than yellow, and both sexes may have some yellow on the nape. Distribution and habitat The white woodpecker has a large distribution in South America to the east of the Andes. Its range extends from Suriname and French Guiana, through much of Brazil to southeastern Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina. It is found at altitudes of up to about , and is non-migratory, but prone to making short distance movements. Its habitat is forest edges, open dry woodland, wooded savannah, scrubland with scattered trees, plantations, orchards, parkland and mangroves. It is opportunistic and adaptable, being seen in city suburbs, and expanding its range into areas of felled timber. Ecology Groups of up to ten white woodpeckers are sometimes seen flying with floppy wing-beats in procession. The diet is varied and includes fruits, berries and seeds, the bird being a significant disperser of some species of seed. It forages in noisy family groups and also raids wild bee and wasp nests, feeding on the adult insects, larvae and honey. It breeds between September and November. It may sometimes nest communally, but very little is known of its breeding habits. Status M. candidus has an extremely large range estimated at over , and seems to be extending its range at the southern end of its distribution. Although it is a generally uncommon bird with a somewhat patchy distribution, the total population is thought to be increasing, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

This process involves the joining of a female gametophyte (megagametophyte, also called the embryo sac) with two male gametes (sperm). It begins when a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of the carpel, the female reproductive structure of a flower. The pollen grain then takes in moisture and begins to germinate, forming a pollen tube that extends down toward the ovary through style. The tip of the pollen tube then enters the ovary and penetrates through the micropyle opening in the ovule. The pollen tube proceeds to release the two sperm in the megagametophyte. The cells of an unfertilized ovule are 8 in number and arranged in the form of 3+2+3 (from top to bottom) i.e. 3 antipodal cells, 2 polar central cells, 2 synergids & 1 egg cell. One sperm fertilizes the egg cell and the other sperm combines with the two polar nuclei of the large central cell of the megagametophyte. The haploid sperm and haploid egg combine to form a diploid zygote, the process being called syngamy, while the other sperm and the two haploid polar nuclei of the large central cell of the megagametophyte form a triploid nucleus (triple fusion). Some plants may form polyploid nuclei. The large cell of the gametophyte will then develop into the endosperm, a nutrient-rich tissue which provides nourishment to the developing embryo. The ovary, surrounding the ovules, develops into the fruit, which protects the seeds and may function to disperse them. The two central cell maternal nuclei (polar nuclei) that contribute to the endosperm, arise by mitosis from the same single meiotic product that gave rise to the egg. The maternal contribution to the genetic constitution of the triploid endosperm is double that of the embryo. In a study conducted in 2008 of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the migration of male nuclei inside the female gamete, in fusion with the female nuclei, has been documented for the first time using in vivo imaging. Some of the genes involved in the migration and fusion process have also been determined. Evidence of double fertilization in Gnetales, which are non-flowering seed plants, has been reported. Brief history Double fertilization was discovered more than a century ago by Sergei Nawaschin and Grignard in Kiev, Russian Empire, and L√©on Guignard in France. Each made the discovery independently of the other. Lilium martagon and Fritillaria tenella were used in the first observations of double fertilization, which were made using the classical light microscope. Due to the limitations of the light microscope, there were many unanswered questions regarding the process of double fertilization. However, with the development of the electron microscope, many of the questions were answered. Most notably, the observations made by the group of W. Jensen showed that the male gametes did not have any cell walls and that the plasma membrane of the gametes is close to the plasma membrane of the cell that surrounds them inside the pollen grain.  Double fertilization in gymnosperms  A far more rudimentary form of double fertilization occurs in the sexual reproduction of an order of gymnosperms commonly known as Gnetales. Specifically, this event has been documented in both Ephedra and Gnetum, a subset of Gnetophytes. In Ephedra nevadensis, a single binucleate sperm cell is deposited into the egg cell. Following the initial fertilization event, the second sperm nucleus is diverted to fertilize an additional egg nucleus found in the egg cytoplasm. In most other seed plants, this second 'ventral canal nucleus' is normally found to be functionally useless. In Gnetum gnemon, numerous free egg nuclei exist in female cytoplasm inside the female gametophyte. Succeeding the penetration of the mature female gametophyte by the pollen tube, female cytoplasm and free nuclei move to surround the pollen tube. Released from the binucleate sperm cell are two sperm nuclei which then join with free egg nuclei to produce two viable zygotes, a homologous characteristic between families Ephedra and Gnetum. In both families, the second fertilization event produces an additional diploid embryo. This supernumerary embryo is later aborted, leading to the synthesis of only one mature embryo. The additional fertilization product in Ephedra does not nourish the primary embryo, as the female gametophyte is responsible for nutrient provision. The more primitive process of double fertilization in gymnosperms results in two diploid nuclei enclosed in the same egg cell. This differs from the angiosperm condition, which results in the separation of the egg cell and endosperm. Comparative molecular research on the genome of G. gnemon has revealed that gnetophytes are more closely related to conifers than they are to angiosperms. The rejection of the anthophyte hypothesis, which identifies gnetales and angiosperms are sister taxa, leads to speculation that the process of double fertilization is a product of convergent evolution and arose independently among gnetophytes and angiosperms. In vitro double fertilization In vitro double fertilization is often used to study the molecular interactions as well as other aspects of gamete fusion in flowering plants. One of the major obstacles in developing an in vitro double fertilization between male and female gametes is the confinement of the sperm in the pollen tube and the egg in the embryo sac. A controlled fusion of the egg and sperm has already been achieved with poppy plants. Pollen germination, pollen tube entry, and double fertilization processes have all been observed to proceed normally. In fact, this technique has already been used to obtain seeds in various flowering plants and was named ‚Äútest-tube fertilization‚Äù. Related structures and functions=Megagametophyte The female gametophyte, the megagametophyte, that participates in double fertilization in angiosperms which is haploid is called the embryo sac. This develops within an ovule, enclosed by the ovary at the base of a carpel. Surrounding the megagametophyte are (one or) two integuments, which form an opening called the micropyle. The megagametophyte, which is usually haploid, originates from the (usually diploid) megaspore mother cell, also called the megasporocyte. The next sequence of events varies, depending on the particular species, but in most species, the following events occur. The megasporocyte undergoes a meiotic cell division, producing four haploid megaspores. Only one of the four resulting megaspores survives. This megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitotic division, resulting in seven cells with eight haploid nuclei (the central cell has two nuclei, called the polar nuclei). The lower end of the embryo sac consists of the haploid egg cell positioned in the middle of two other haploid cells, called synergids. The synergids function in the attraction and guidance of the pollen tube to the megagametophyte through the micropyle. At the upper end of the megagametophyte are three antipodal cells. Microgametophyte The male gametophytes, or microgametophytes, that participate in double fertilization are contained within pollen grains. They develop within the microsporangia, or pollen sacs, of the anthers on the stamens. Each microsporangium contains diploid microspore mother cells, or microsporocytes. Each microsporocyte undergoes meiosis, forming four haploid microspores, each of which can eventually develop into a pollen grain. A microspore undergoes mitosis and cytokinesis in order to produce two separate cells, the generative cell and the tube cell. These two cells in addition to the spore wall make up an immature pollen grain. As the male gametophyte matures, the generative cell passes into the tube cell, and the generative cell undergoes mitosis, producing two sperm cells. Once the pollen grain has matured, the anthers break open, releasing the pollen. The pollen is carried to the pistil of another flower, by wind or animal pollinators, and deposited on the stigma. As the pollen grain germinates, the tube cell produces the pollen tube, which elongates and extends down the long style of the carpel and into the ovary, where its sperm cells are released in the megagametophyte. Double fertilization proceeds from here.

Strict Irish Kennel Club rules governed the Teastas Mor (certificate of gameness). It was considered that the discipline ensured contests between dog and badger were fair. In the past, to become an Irish Kennel Club terrier champion, it was necessary for a terrier to be in possession of a Teastas Mor. Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, Irish Terrier ( Irish Red Terriers) and Kerry Blue Terrier (a.k.a. Irish Blue Terriers) were the principal breeds used. These continued until the kennel ceased to license trials in 1968. Rules 1\\\\. The trials must be conducted strictly within the law and are restricted to dogs and bitches which have not already qualified for the Teastas Mor certificate. 2\\\\. a) A veterinary surgeon must be in attendance at the trial. Under no circumstances may a trial take place without one, and his name and address must be recorded on the application for a licence and on the licence issued by the Kennel Club. 2\\\\. b) In the event of any serious injury occurring to any dog or badger, the animal at the discretion of the Veterinary Surgeon shall be humanely and expeditiously destroyed. 3\\\\. The trial of any dog must be in natural setts. Under no circumstances may tests be carried out in artificial setts. A dog may not be tried more than twice in any trial. 4\\\\. Once a badger is \\"drawn\\" (pulled out of the ground), it must not be released or returned to the earth until the conclusion of the trials. 5\\\\. Badger in captivity shall not be used for tests or training. 6\\\\. Sounders (dogs making a particular sound which means \\"I have found it.\\") are expected to go to the ground with alacrity. When a sounder reports the presence of game with a \\"full and sustained tongue\\", a reasonable time shall be allowed before men with shovels begin to dig. If the sounder records persistently from one section of the sett, digging shall commence under the direction of the judges. 7\\\\. The badger shall be drawn by a strong terrier, with the assistance if necessary, and the size of the badger and underground conditions noted by the judges. 8\\\\. If a sett is apparently unoccupied, several terriers may be run through it and their eagerness to search noted. 9\\\\. With regards to strong terriers, the Teastas Mor is to be awarded to the terrier showing gameness in attacking badgers. Five minutes is the minimum period a terrier shall be in contact with the badger, except when the terrier draws the badger in less time. Each terrier shall be withdrawn as soon as possible after the five minutes have expired. The judges may direct that a terrier be again tried if, in their opinion, the first trial was for any reason an insufficient test. 10\\\\. Five minutes are to be allowed a terrier before being disqualified for failing to get in contact. 11\\\\. Barking shall be eliminated as much as possible and disqualification will follow barking after contact, provided that no terrier is disqualified for barking when in actual contact.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 22, 2002. The episode was directed by James Purdum and written by Eric Horsted. The plot centers on Zoidberg's experience with the concept of freedom on Earth. Plot The crew celebrates Freedom Day, a day where one can do anything they want, regardless of the consequences. Dr. Zoidberg seems passionate about the holiday, as he loves the idea of freedom, something he did not have on his home planet Decapod 10. At the big Freedom Day celebration in Washington, D.C., Earth President Richard Nixon's head unveils the Earth flag \\"Old Freebie\\" to celebrate the spirit of the holiday but the flag is eaten by Zoidberg. Zoidberg feels this is an expression of his freedom on Freedom Day; however, the rest of the crowd sees him as a traitor. Zoidberg is chased around town and takes cover in his planet's embassy. Zoidberg is put on trial and the crew hires lawyer Old Man Waterfall to represent him. Zoidberg is found guilty and sentenced to death when he refuses to apologize publicly. After Earth's army storms the Decapodian embassy to seize Zoidberg, the Decapodian ambassador to Earth summons the Decapodian military to retaliate. The Decapodian army easily defeats Earth's defense forces and Earth is enslaved by the crustacean extraterrestrials. Later, Fry, Leela, Bender, Zapp Brannigan, and Kif, deciding the time has come to fight back, steal a heat-seeking missile from a museum exhibit and launch it toward the Decopodians‚Äô newly constructed Mobile Oppression Palace. However, the palace is \\"cold-blooded\\", like the Decapodians themselves, and the palace continues its destructive rampage. It eventually crushes Old Man Waterfall for standing in its way, whom Zoidberg respected for defending him when no one else would. Zoidberg then lights a flag on fire. This shocks and angers the other citizens, but Zoidberg explains that he does so in order to preserve the freedom that the flag represents and throws it toward the Mobile Oppression Palace, attracting the missile and thus destroying the palace. Zoidberg is declared a hero and is honored by Nixon at a ceremony, where he unveils a new Earth flag, out of which Zoidberg is allowed to take a bite. Zoidberg concludes that Earth, not Decapod 10, is now his true home planet. Reception The A.V. Clubs Zack Handlen gave the episode a B+, saying: \\"There‚Äôs a fundamental shallowness to ‚ÄúA Taste Of Freedom‚Äù which is at once useful for the comedy (because delving into the issues never distracts from the jokes), and disappointing in the story. The episode takes the most predictable stance on its premise‚Äîeating the flag is not something you should be arrested for‚Äîand then doesn‚Äôt offer much variation outside of a series of escalating incidents. That makes for a diverting half hour that occasionally stabs at legitimate criticism, but one that‚Äôs ultimately more forgettable than its various absurdities would suggest.\\" ReferencesExternal links *A Taste of Freedom at The Infosphere. * * Category:Futurama (season 4) episodes Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about freedom of expression Category:Flag controversies ","title":"A Taste of Freedom"},{"id":"3757569","text":"Adam Barr is a television screenwriter and producer best known for his comedy credits including the hit NBC series Will & Grace.

Perry was one of the doctors who attended to President John F. Kennedy at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 after Kennedy was shot. Two days later, he attended to Kennedy's alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald after he was shot. Biography Perry was born in Allen, Texas on September 3, 1929. He was raised by his grandfather, Malcolm Oliver Perry I. Perry graduated from Plano High School in 1947 and went on to the University of Texas at Austin. Following his school life in 1951 with a Bachelor of Arts, Perry went to Southwestern Medical School, becoming a Medical Doctor in 1955. Perry did his internship at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco, California, for a year, before joining the United States Air Force for two years. Perry was stationed at Geiger Field in Spokane, Washington. Following his military duties, Perry worked at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, for four years as a general surgical resident, although from September 1962 to September 1963, he traveled to the University of California at San Francisco to study vascular surgery. During that time, he became board certified by the American Board of Surgery. When President Kennedy was shot on November 22, 1963, he was taken to Parkland Hospital. Perry was one of the doctors to attend to Kennedy, performing a tracheotomy over the small wound in Kennedy's throat. Perry also rendered aid to Texas Governor John Connally, who was travelling in the car with Kennedy and was also shot. Perry stated three times at a press conference later that day that Kennedy's neck wound appeared to be an entrance wound. Although his statement appeared to be definitive, he had not intended it to be.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat;=19731119&id;=IqArAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=XfwFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6247,2559356&hl;=en When interviewed by the Warren Commission, Perry said that he then believed that a \\"full jacketed bullet without deformation passing through the skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and entrance wound and with the facts which you have made available and with these assumptions, I believe that it was an exit wound.\\" Following the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby on November 24, Perry was one of the doctors to tend to Oswald. Following Oswald's death, Perry made an effort to leave the Dallas area in order to avoid the many press conferences and press questions. Perry left for McAllen in Hidalgo County in south Texas, the home of his mother-in-law, but he was followed there by a reporter from United Press International. Subsequently, a news story was published about him in the New York Herald-Tribune. Perry characterized the article as \\"overly dramatic, garish and in poor taste, and ethically damaging to me.\\" Perry rarely spoke about the events of November 22nd, saying that it was simply a terrible day and one he chose not to talk about again. Perry later became chief of vascular surgery at Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan from 1978 to 1988. He served as a professor in the Department of Surgery at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas in the early 1990s. He was professor emeritus at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center until his death. Later life Perry lived in Jacksonville, Texas.

He was the author of the book on the life of his cousin Columba, the Vita, probably written between 697 and 700. The biography is by far the most important surviving work written in early medieval Scotland, and is a vital source for our knowledge of the Picts, and an insight into the life of Iona and the early medieval Gaelic monk. Adomn√°n promulgated the Law of Adomn√°n or \\"Law of Innocents\\" (). He also wrote the treatise De Locis Sanctis (i.e. \\"On Holy Places\\"), an account of the great Christian holy places and centres of pilgrimage. Adomn√°n got much of his information from a Frankish bishop called Arculf, who had personally visited the Egypt, Rome, Constantinople and the Holy Land, and visited Iona afterwards. Life Adomn√°n was born about 624, a relative on his father's side of Columba.Wetherill, Jeffrey. \\"Adomn√°n, Iona, and the Life of St. Columba: Their Place Among Continental Saints\\", The Heroic Age, No. 6, Spring 2003 He was the son of R√≥n√°n mac Tinne by Ronat, a woman from the Northern U√≠ N√©ill lineage known as the Cen√©l n√ânda. Adomn√°n's birthplace was probably in or near Raphoe, a town in what later became T√≠r Chonaill (now mainly County Donegal), in Ulster in the north of Ireland. Some of Adomn√°n's childhood anecdotes seem to confirm at least an upbringing in this fertile eastern part of present-day County Donegal, not far from the modern city of Derry. It is thought that Adomn√°n may have begun his monastic career at a Columban monastery called Druim Tuamma, but any Columban foundation in northern Ireland or D√°l Riata is a possibility, although Durrow is a stronger possibility than most. He probably joined the Columban familia (i.e. the federation of monasteries under the leadership of Iona Abbey) around the year 640. Some modern commentators believe that he could not have come to Iona until sometime after the year 669, the year of the accession of F√°ilbe mac P√≠p√°in, the first abbot of whom Adomn√°n gives any information. However, Richard Sharpe argues that he probably came to Iona during the abbacy of S√©g√©ne (d. 652). Whenever or wherever Adomn√°n received his education, Adomn√°n attained a level of learning rare in Early Medieval Northern Europe. It has been suggested by Alfred Smyth that Adomn√°n spent some years teaching and studying at Durrow,Smyth, Alfred. Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80‚Äì1000, Edinburgh University Press, 1984 and while this is not accepted by all scholars, it remains a strong possibility. Iona Abbey In 679, Adomn√°n became the ninth abbot of Iona after Columba.Grattan-Flood, William. \\"St. Adamnan.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 11 Mar. 2014 Abbot Adomn√°n enjoyed a friendship with King Aldfrith of Northumbria. In 684, Aldfrith had been staying with Adomn√°n in Iona. In 686, after the death of Aldfrith's brother King Ecgfrith of Northumbria and Aldfrith's succession to the kingship, Adomn√°n was in the Kingdom of Northumbria on the request of King F√≠nsnechta Fledach of Brega in order to gain the freedom of sixty Gaels who had been captured in a Northumbrian raid two years before. Adomn√°n, in keeping with Ionan tradition, made several more trips to the lands of the English during his abbacy, including one the following year. It is sometimes thought, after the account given by Bede, that it was during his visits to Northumbria, under the influence of Abbot Ceolfrith, that Adomn√°n decided to adopt the Roman dating of Easter that had been agreed some years before at the Synod of Whitby. Bede implies that this led to a schism at Iona, whereby Adomn√°n became alienated from the Iona brethren and went to Ireland to convince the Irish of the Roman dating. Jeffrey Wetherill sees Adomn√°n's long absences from Iona as having led to something of an undermining of his authority; he was thus unable to persuade the monks to adopt the Roman dating of Easter, let alone the tonsure. It is clear that Adomn√°n did adopt that Roman dating, and moreover, probably did argue the case for it in Ireland. C√°in Adomn√°in It is generally believed that in 697, Adomn√°n promulgated the C√°in Adomn√°in, meaning literally the \\"Canons\\" or \\"Law of Adomn√°n\\". The C√°in Adomn√°in was promulgated amongst a gathering of Irish, D√°l Riatan and Pictish notables at the Synod of Birr. It is a set of laws designed, among other things, to guarantee the safety and immunity of various types of non-combatants in warfare. For this reason it is also known as the \\"Law of Innocents\\". Works Adomn√°n's most important work, and the one for which he is best known, is the Vita Columbae (i.e. \\"Life of Columba\\"), a hagiography of Iona's founder, Columba,Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Saints, Vol.IX, 1866 probably written between 697 and 700. The format borrows to some extent from Sulpicius Severus' Life of Saint Martin of Tours.Nilsson, Sara E. Ellis. \\"Miracle Stories and the Primary Purpose of Adomn√°n's Vita Columbae\\", The Heroic Age, No. 10, May 2007 Adomn√°n adapted traditional forms of Christian biography to group stories about Columba thematically rather than chronologically,Bullough, Donald A., \\"Columba, Adomn√°n and the achievement of Iona: Part I\\", The Scottish Historical Review,43, pp. 111‚Äì130, 1964 and present Columba as comparable to a hero in Gaelic mythology.Picard, Jean-Michel. \\"The purpose of Adomn√°n's Vita Columbae\\", Peritia, 1, pp. 160‚Äì177, 1982. Wetherill suggests that one of the motivations for writing the Vita was to offer Columba as a model for the monks, and thereby improve Adomn√°n's standing as abbot. The biography is by far the most important surviving work written in early medieval Scotland, and is a vital source for our knowledge of the Picts, as well as a great insight into the life of Iona and the early medieval Gaelic monk. However, the Vita was not his only work. Adomn√°n also wrote the treatise De Locis Sanctis (i.e. \\"On Holy Places\\"), an account of the great Christian holy places and centres of pilgrimage. Adomn√°n got much of his information from a Frankish bishop called Arculf, who had personally visited the Egypt, Rome, Constantinople and the Holy Land, and visited Iona afterwards. Adomn√°n gave a copy to the scholar-king Aldfrith of Northumbria (685‚Äì704). Also attributed to him is a good deal of Gaelic poetry, including a celebration of the Pictish King Bridei's (671‚Äì93) victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dun Nechtain (685). Death Adomn√°n died in 704, and became a saint in Scottish and Irish tradition, as well as one of the most important figures in either Scottish or Irish history. His death and feast day are commemorated on 23 September. Along with Columba, he is joint patron of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raphoe, which encompasses the bulk of County Donegal in the north west of Ireland. The Cathedral of St. Eunan and St. Columba (popularly known as St. Eunan's Cathedral), the Catholic cathedral in that diocese, is in Letterkenny.  Legacy  In his native Donegal, Adomn√°n has given his name to several institutions and buildings including: * The Cathedral of St. Eunan and St Columba in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal; the current seat of the Bishop of Raphoe, * The Anglican St Eunan's Cathedral in Raphoe, Donegal, * St Eunan's NS, a national school in the town of Raphoe, Donegal, * St Eunan's College, a secondary school in Letterkenny, * St Eunan's NS, a national school in the small village of Laghey, just south of Donegal Town, * St Eunan's GAA, a GAA club in Letterkenny, County Donegal In Co.

Controversy In March 2015, Armytage was accused of racism in an on-air interview, after congratulating a woman for looking whiter than her twin. After an online petition was signed by over 2,000 people calling for her to apologise, she did so. In February 2016, a Sex and The City themed skit on Sunrise with actress Kristen Davis backfired on Armytage. Davis had appeared on the show to discuss her work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, but later on Twitter expressed her annoyance that Sunrise focused on her role in Sex and The City. After the incident, Armytage, who was meant to MC and conduct an interview with Davis at a UN event in Sydney, was asked not to host or attend the event. In March 2018, Armytage hosted a segment on Sunrise focusing on Aboriginal adoption, during which she incorrectly claimed that Aboriginal children could not be fostered by White people and stated that \\"Post-Stolen Generation, there's been a huge move to leave Aboriginal children where they are, even if they're being neglected in their own families.\\" Protests were held outside the Sunrise studio in Martin Place in response to the segment. In September 2018, the Australian Communications and Media Authority ruled that the segment had breached the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, as it contained inaccurate statements and \\"strong negative generalisations about Indigenous people as a group\\".

Armytage was raised on a property near Adaminaby, where her father was the manager. She attended boarding school in Sydney starting from Year Nine.

He was born in New York City. Pelham regularly did blackface acts in the early 1840s both solo and as part of a duo or trio. His early performances were in the mould of Thomas D. Rice; he did song-and-dance versions of \\"Gumbo Chaff\\" and \\"Oh Pshaw!\\", among others. His brother, Gilbert Pelham, paired with him for part of his early career. The song \\"Massa Is a Stingy Man\\" became their trademark tune. Pelham was also a renowned dancer; by 1845, he was ranked so highly that William Henry Lane did an impression of him. In 1843, Pelham became one of the founding members of the Virginia Minstrels, the first group to present a full minstrel show during a performance at the New York Bowery Amphitheatre on February 6, 1843. Through April 1843, he played tambourine as the Virginia Minstrels toured New York City and Boston. Pelham's style was something new for the time; in addition to traditional techniques, he played it like a drum.Nathan 126. Pelham and Frank Brower, who played the bones, were the first minstrel endmen, and greatly influenced the stereotype. Pelham's stage demeanor involved \\"looks and movements comic beyond conception. He seemed animated by a savage energy; and [the handling of his instrument] . . . nearly wrung him off his seat. His white eyes rolled in a curious frenzy . . . and his hiccupping chuckles were unsurpassable.\\"1846 review in England, printed in a pamphlet on the Ethiopian Serenaders. Pelham was playing bones in this concert. Quoted in Nathan 125. Pelham's signature non-musical bit was his \\"A Brief Battering at the Blues\\", a comic monologue and prototypical stump speech. On April 21, 1843, when the group broke up. Pelham decided to settle in England. He briefly helped reform the Virginia Minstrels in the spring of 1844 when he met up with Brower and Joel Sweeney in Liverpool. The trio convinced Dan Emmett to rejoin, and the new ensemble played the Theatre Royal, Dublin, from April 24 to May 7 . They toured through June, then broke up again. Over the next few decades, Pelham continued to perform, only now with British minstrel troupes. Pablo Fanque, one of Victorian England's most celebrated circus proprietors (later immortalized in The Beatles song \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\"), helped popularize a Pelham sketch in England through performances at his circus in the 1860s. One of the most popular routines at Pablo's circus at Bolton in 1868 was Pelham's \\"Wha's Your Ticket?\\" in which an actor portrays \\"the character of a Negro engaged to collect tickets at a bal masque with express instructions to allow no one to pass without, but who by his blundering allows all to enter without that requisite.\\" The sketch was described in 1859 as a \\"new afterpiece expressly imported from New Orleans by permission of R.W. Pelham Esq.\\" The sketch was still being performed in England as a \\"laughable American sketch\\" as late as 1888.Gretchen Holrook Gerzina, Editor, \\"Black Victorians-Black Victoriana\\" (Rutgers University Press: New Brunswick, NJ, 2003) The huge success of a recent British tour by the African-American Master Juba may have adversely affected Pelham's career there as his performance suffered in comparison.Pelham felt obliged to place a notice in The Times rebutting an unfavourable review in the Sunday Times the day before, from which he quotes, adversely comparing him with Juba: \\"Marylebone - Novelty and variety have certainly not been among the desiderata at this theatre of late, for no sooner are the talents of 'that eminent American tragedian' Mr. Buchanan withdrawn from these boards than that 'incomparable American wonder' Mr. R.W. Pelham appears thereon. He is described in the bills as 'the only true delineator of the slaves and free blacks that has ever appeared at any theatre in Europe or America' - pretty bold assertion this - and he has been playing the character of Sambo Hit-'em-Hard every night of the past week in a piece we believe, of his own compilation...we must observe that Mr. Pelham's entertainment and Mr. Pelham's acting were dry, tame and ineffective. His \\"cotton picking reel,\\" as it was termed, was a very wretched imitation of Juba's style of dancing...\\". In his reply Pelham states that he \\"can prove by the American press the fact of his having danced before the public in his own style years before Juba was heard of.\\" The Times, Monday, Oct 25, 1852; pg. 4; Issue 21255; col A His final performance was on August 19, 1856.

Hillcourt was a prolific writer and teacher in the areas of woodcraft, troop and patrol structure, and training; his written works include three editions of the BSA's official Boy Scout Handbook, with over 12.6 million copies printed, other Scouting-related books and numerous magazine articles. Hillcourt developed and promoted the American adaptation of the Wood Badge adult Scout leader training program. Hillcourt was Danish, but moved to the United States as a young adult. From his start in Danish Scouting in 1910 until his death in 1992, he was continuously active in Scouting. He traveled all over the world teaching and training both Scouts and Scouters, earning many of Scouting's highest honors. His legacy and influence can still be seen today in the BSA program and in Scouting training manuals and methods for both youth and adults. Personal life Hillcourt was born in 1900 in Aarhus, Denmark and was the youngest of three sons of a building contractor. He was given the name Vilhelm Hans Bjerregaard Jensen. Around 1930, he changed his name by anglicizing \\"Vilhelm\\", translating \\"Bjerregaard\\" into \\"Hill-court\\" and dropping \\"Jensen\\". His first published work was a poem about trolls and elves, printed by an Aarhus newspaper when he was nine years old. For Christmas 1910, Hillcourt's brother gave him a Danish translation of Scouting for Boys by Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout movement. He went on to earn the highest award in Danish Scouting, Knight-Scout in 1918, at age 17. He was selected to represent his troop at the 1st World Scout Jamboree in Olympia in 1920 where he first met Baden-Powell, with whom he was later to work. While Hillcourt studied pharmacy in Copenhagen, he became more involved in Scouting. As a Scout leader, he became a Scoutmaster, national instructor, writer and then the editor for the Danish Scouting journal. He wrote his first book, The Island, recounting his early Scouting experiences. After deciding to experience Scouting around the world and to return home with the best ideas, Hillcourt worked his way through Europe and England and then arrived in the United States in February 1926. Includes \\"The Life of a Serendipitist\\", an autobiographical sketch by William Hillcourt. He was soon hired by the BSA's national office and worked for the BSA until he retired as a professional Scouter in 1965. In 1933 Hillcourt married Grace Brown, the personal secretary of Chief Scout Executive James E. West. Scouting career Hillcourt worked at a BSA camp at Bear Mountain in Harriman State Park, New York, in 1926 where he became an instructor in American Indian dance. He then worked for the BSA Supply Division where he broke his leg when a crate fell on him. He met James West while riding in an elevator at the national office. West solicited Hillcourt's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18-page memo detailing issues with the lack of patrol structure and leadership. He recommended that the BSA write a handbook for patrol leaders, and that it needed to be written by someone who had been both a patrol leader and a Scoutmaster. West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first Handbook for Patrol Leaders which was published in 1929. Hillcourt with a totem pole, made by Ernest Thompson Seton, on his lawn, featured in an tribute in the magazine Scouting From 1932 until his retirement in 1965, Hillcourt was a major contributor to Boys' Life, the magazine for Scouting youth. Each monthly issue included a page on advancement and Scoutcraft, outdoor Scouting skills, and included his signature superimposed over the two green bars that are the emblem of the patrol leader, which led to his moniker \\"Green Bar Bill\\" and its adoption as the logo of his regular Boys' Life column. Hillcourt was tasked to write a new manual for Scoutmasters in 1934 and worked with his good friend and colleague E. Urner Goodman, the national program director of the BSA. He and his wife moved to a house in Mendham Borough, New Jersey, to be near Schiff Scout Reservation, the BSA's national training center, so he could be in place to put his theories to a practical test. In order to do so, he founded Troop 1 of Mendham in 1935 as a unit directly chartered to the National Council of the BSA. As the Scoutmaster, he used Troop 1 to test and validate his work for 16 years. The Baden-Powells visited Schiff in 1935 and began a steadfast friendship with the Hillcourts. Baden-Powell died in 1941. After World War II, Baden-Powell's widow, Olave Baden-Powell, allowed Hillcourt to edit Aids to Scoutmastership into the World Brotherhood Editions to help the Scouting movement recover from the war. She then allowed Hillcourt access to Baden-Powell's letters, diaries and sketchbooks when she and Hillcourt co-authored the narrative biography of Baden-Powell, Baden-Powell: The Two Lives of a Hero. The BSA national office moved from New York City to North Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1954, and the Hillcourts moved with it. He completed the sixth edition of the Boy Scout Handbook in time for the BSA's 50th anniversary in 1960. Wood Badge To encourage the creation of Rovering in the U.S., J. S. Wilson travelled from the UK to oversee a Wood Badge course in May 1936 at Schiff. Hillcourt was a participant in that first course and four days later, he was the senior patrol leader for the second course. He received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 and was appointed as the deputy camp director for Wood Badge. After World War II, Wood Badge was revived and Hillcourt was the Scoutmaster for a test course begun on July 31, 1948, at Schiff and the first standard course at Philmont Scout Ranch. As the national director of training, Hillcourt wore five Wood Badge beads, a tradition that has been discontinued in the U.K. Scout Association, however other countries still continue the use of the five Wood Badge Beads and are still worn by the National Volunteer Leader of Wood Badge Training of each country as well as by special decree of Gilwell Park today. In the year before his retirement on August 1, 1965, the national council began a program to update the Wood Badge program and shift its emphasis from teaching Scoutcraft to leadership skills. After he was officially retired, his opinion was still sought after and respected. Dr. John W. Larson, Director of Boy Scout Leader Training for the National Council, was working with B√©la H. B√°n√°thy and Bob Perin, Assistant National Director, Volunteer Training Service, to adapt the leadership competencies of the White Stag Leadership Development Program into a new Wood Badge syllabus. Hillcourt was among the few on the National Staff who strongly resisted the change to the Wood Badge program. He attended the presentation that Larson made to the national Scout committee on the new Wood Badge curriculum. Larson later reported, \\"He fought us all the way ... He had a vested interest in what had been and resisted every change. I just told him to settle down, everything was going to be all right.\\" Hillcourt presented an alternative to Larson's plan to incorporate leadership into Wood Badge. Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton asked Larson to look at Hillcourt's plan, and Larson reported back that it was the same stuff, just reordered and rewritten. Larson's plan for Wood Badge was approved and he moved ahead to begin implementing the proposed changes. Later life Hillcourt later in life Hillcourt retired from the BSA on August 1, 1965. In 1971, he and Grace finally completed the world tour he had started in 1926; along the way they attended the 13th World Scout Jamboree in Fujinomiya, Japan. Grace Hillcourt died in 1973. Rather than live alone, Bill moved into the home of his good friends Carson and Martha Buck. The BSA had introduced the \\"Improved Scouting Program\\" in 1972, along with a new edition of the Boy Scout Handbook. Many of the changes were intended to expand Scouting to a broader base of youth and to make Scouting more \\"in tune with the times\\". Many Scouters, including Hillcourt, were critical of the new program changes, exclaiming that the de- emphasis on traditional outdoor skills had taken the \\"outing out of Scouting\\". This change proved to be unsuccessful, deterring existing adherents and attracting relatively few new enrolments. To remedy this situation, Hillcourt convinced Chief Scout Executive Harvey L. Price that a new handbook was needed. Hillcourt then came out of retirement and spent a year writing and editing the 1979 edition of The Official Boy Scout Handbook, returning to the focus of Scoutcraft. In addition, he helped to develop the All Out for Scouting program that launched the return to the old standards. Hillcourt was regarded as a prominent figure and guide in BSA's recovery from its experiment earlier in that decade. Hillcourt was recognized for his service to youth by the BSA with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award on May 19, 1978.When or if Hillcourt earned the Eagle Scout Award is uncertain. The official BSA DESA list shows that Hillcourt earned Eagle Scout in 1918‚Äîthe year he earned Knight-Scout in Denmark‚Äîbut he did not arrive in the U.S. until 1926. In 1980, the BSA presented Hillcourt with their highest national honor, the Silver Buffalo Award and he was cited as \\"The Voice of Scouting\\". The World Scout Committee of the World Organization of the Scout Movement recognized him for exceptional services to world Scouting in 1985 with the Bronze Wolf Award. In the same year, an article in the Scouting magazine proclaimed Hillcourt as \\"the foremost influence on development of the Boy Scouting program.\\" In the last 12 months of 1985, he traveled to Dallas, Washington, Knoxville, Houston, San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles, and other cities. He also attended the World Conference held for the first time in Germany, an inter-American scout conference in Brazil (with side trips to ArgentinaXVI Conferencia Scout Interamericana (18 ‚Äì 23 Septiembre, Buenos Aires), Resumen de la Conferencia, P√°gina 04 . and Paraguay).

And then, of course, in the middle of the times, he continued to camp in the different events that took place during his campaign, and did not fail to make a presence with his uninterrupted record, with the Jamboree. In 1990 he also became a member of Firecrafter, an American Scouting service organization. Travel and appearances at Scouting events both local and worldwide were part of his routine until he died, for which he was referred to as Scoutmaster to the World. Hillcourt died at the age of 92, in Stockholm, Sweden, while traveling on a Scouting tour with Carson Buck in 1992. He is buried with his wife Grace in St. Joseph's Cemetery in Mendham, New Jersey near Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation, where he lived for many years. His legacy in Scouting and his influence continue in the programs and training of Scouting. His writings are still used within the Scouting movement and his material continues to be reprinted in Scouting magazine. The Longhouse Council operates the William Hillcourt Scout Museum and Carson Buck Memorial Library at Camp Woodland in New York to \\"keep the traditions of Scouting alive\\" through the preservation of the history that is a foundation for today's Scouting movement. Works Hillcourt was one of the BSA's most prolific writers. He wrote numerous articles for Boys' Life and Scouting magazines, including a column aimed at patrol leaders under the by-line of \\"Patrol Leader Green Bar Bill\\".

Background and specifications ING 4727 was built in 1990. It was a dry cargo cover-top barge with a steel hull. It had an overall length of 200 feet (61 m), a beam of 35 feet (10.7 m) and a height of 12 feet (3.7 m), plus a coaming height of approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) above the deck. The fiberglass covers atop the hopper added another approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) of height. The cargo hopper yielded 84659 cubes of volume. Fully loaded to a draft of 10 feet (3 m), the barge could carry 1,877 tons of cargo. Light (empty) draft was 1 foot 4 & 1/2 inches (0.4 m). ING 4727 and Hurricane Katrina Shortly before Katrina, ING 4727 was under charter by Lafarge North America, having recently delivered a load of cement, and was reportedly empty just before the storm. ING 4727 was reportedly in the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal in New Orleans when the storm hit. Evidently not secured adequately for hurricane conditions, the barge found its way into the Industrial Canal (also known as the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal) where it went through (or caused‚Äîsee below) a breach into the Lower 9th Ward neighborhood. While many other vessels in southeast Louisiana broke their moorings during the storm, ING 4727 became particularly notable both due to its size and because of where it landed. Although its dimensions are standard for barges in commerce on the Mississippi River System (of which the Industrial Canal is a part), it is larger than most Louisianan houses. During and right after the storm, ING 4727 was moved around by currents in the flooded neighborhood, smashing houses and cars beneath it in an area of several city blocks. Speculation on the barge's role Many locals blame the barge for the catastrophic inundation of the area. Some lawyers have blamed the barge, including its owners and the cement terminal that had moored the barge and which had the barge in its care, custody, and control at the time of the hurricane. A week after the storm Army Corps of Engineers project manager Al Naomi gave his preliminary impression, saying, \\"One would think it's the barge that did it,\\" and confirming that the barge striking the floodwalls would have \\"precipitated a tremendous collapse\\". However, in the preliminary report presented to Congress, experts say that the barge was drawn through an existing hole in the floodwall, and that it was the topping of the Industrial Canal floodwall, not the barge, that caused the break. The LSU report subsequently found that overtopping did not occur, rather, design failures precipited the levee failures. By late 2007, several investigations were completed that included analysis of the question of whether the barge had a causative role in one or more of the failures in the floodwalls atop the Industrial Canal levees, or whether it came into the city from an already-existing breach. The investigators funded by the National Science Foundation‚Äîfrom the University of California at Berkeley‚Äîconcluded that the barge went through an already-existing breach caused by foundation failure of the floodwall. Another group of investigators, funded by the State of Louisiana, came to the same conclusion. Finally, a $20 million study, funded by the Department of Defense/United States Army Corps of Engineers, blamed the Industrial Canal levee failures on overtopping of the floodwalls by the storm surge and resulting scour and undermining of the foundation and not the barge. There is also speculation that the barge may have caused the other nearby breaches in the Industrial Canal by striking the floodwalls on the other side before bouncing back and going all the way through the levee near the end of Prieur Street, although all the scientists and engineers who investigated the failures regard such speculation as dubious and without any evidentiary basis. After Katrina As the Lower 9th Ward was dewatered, ING 4727 at first came to rest atop a number of house sites on the east side of Jourdan Avenue. Hurricane Rita, however, subsequently raised the water level in the Industrial Canal sufficiently to top the still-incomplete levee repairs, reflooding the area and refloating the barge. As waters were again drained from the area, the barge came to rest a few dozen yards from its earlier location, diagonally across Jourdan Avenue near the intersection of North Roman Street, partially atop former homes and a school bus. In the months after Katrina, the barge became a morbid tourist attraction for those interested in the devastation. On 22 February 2006, salvage work began which lifted the barge approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) into the air using inflatable bags so that the bottom of the vessel could be inspected for damage, and on 24 February Titan Maritime began the process of cutting up and removing it from the area. A number of pieces were under court order to be preserved as evidence in pending lawsuits, although that order has been modified to allow for the disposal of all remaining portions of the barge . Removal of the pieces of the barge from the Lower 9th Ward was completed the third week of March 2006. On 4 June 2007, a Federal trial looking into possible liability of Ingram and other parties for damage from the barge began in New Orleans. On March 31, 2008, Judge Helen Berrigan, Chief Judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, issued an Opinion that exonerated the barge owner, Ingram Barge Company, from any liability for the ING 4727 breaking free of its moorings during or after Hurricane Katrina passed through the New Orleans area.

Directed by Don Taylor, it featured a script by a young Dario Argento and a score by Ennio Morricone.  Plot  Mexican rebels hire the \\"Dutchman\\" to rob a train carrying $500,000 in gold on behalf of Victoriano Huerta to finance the Mexican Revolution. Dutchman then enlists four other men to assist him, promising to pay each of them a thousand dollars. They are Mesito, a strong man on the run for cattle rustling; Luis, a circus acrobat turned outlaw; Augustus, a former army officer and explosives specialist who had served in the same unit as Dutchman; and a samurai warrior (referred to only as Samurai), earning a living in a sideshow. Immediately after they assemble, their first undertaking is to save the rebel leader who hired them from being executed. After rescuing him and causing a riot in the village, the five men are forced to flee, along with all the villagers, in order to prevent reprisals. Nevertheless, some soldiers still manage to find the Five and bring them to the local Army commandant. A Mexican woman slips Samurai a knife and the men manage to escape, killing the soldiers and dynamiting the fort's magazine. They are tracked by a large group of mounted pursuers and escape capture after coming upon a small group of rebels, who are there to cover the Five's escape. Though they know that they will be unable to stop the soldiers, the rebels are willing to sacrifice themselves for the Five in the cause of the revolution. The train carrying the gold is heavily defended by a cannon, machine guns, and dozens of soldiers. The Dutchman's plan is to board the train and uncouple the car carrying the gold without stopping it. The difficult robbery succeeds, despite Samurai falling off the train and having to run across country after it, as well as Augustus dropping a key piece of equipment and having to improvise. When the Five return to their hideout, conflict arises amongst them. Luis, Augustus, Mesito and Samurai had all assumed they were going to take the gold for themselves, while the Dutchman is set on keeping his promise to the rebels. He disarms the other four and explains to them that his motivation for supporting the revolution is because his wife had been executed by soldiers since other members of her family were rebels. The Dutchman is about to leave with the gold, but he is stopped by the arrival of a mounted squad of soldiers. He therefore has to rearm the other four, who are able to ambush and quickly kill all of their opponents. Now armed again, Augustus, Mesito, and Samurai seem set on taking back the gold, but they are stopped at gunpoint by Luis, who has decided that he will join the Revolution too.

There are two plans: *The Texas Guaranteed Tuition Plan *The Texas College Savings Plan (formerly the Tomorrow's College Investment Plan). The former is a constitutionally guaranteed trust fund backed by the State of Texas, whereas the latter is an investment plan managed by NorthStar Financial Services Group, LLC. The Texas College Savings Plan is not backed directly by the state; it serves as an investment plan for tuition money, as opposed to a prepaid fund. In 2003 a Texas law was introduced to allow public institutions of higher education to set their own tuition and fees, rather than being forced to charge what the State thought was appropriate. The State's guaranteed tuition plan was in jeopardy, for the State could not effectively predict how expensive tuition was going to be a decade from now and, consequently, could not accurately peg charges for applicants. New enrollment in the Texas Guaranteed Tuition Plan was then closed. As an example of how much non-regulated tuition has cost the Texas Tomorrow Fund, a family purchasing 120 credit hours for a child's entrance to a public college in 2004 paid a total of $10,000 -- about $83 per credit hour. As of fall 2016, the payout, due to rising tuition costs, was approximately $300 per credit hour.  Texas Tomorrow Fund in the Texas Constitution  Located in Article 7, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution, the Texas Tomorrow Fund was added November 4, 1997, for the purpose of higher education in Texas. The Section is as follows, > \\"(a) The Texas tomorrow fund is created as a trust fund dedicated to the > prepayment of tuition and fees for higher education as provided by the > general laws of this state for the prepaid higher education tuition program. > The assets of the fund are held in trust for the benefit of participants and > beneficiaries and may not be diverted. The state shall hold the assets of > the fund for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants > and beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the > program. > (b) Financing of benefits must be based on sound actuarial principles. The > amount contributed by a person participating in the prepaid higher education > program shall be as provided by the general laws of this state, but may not > be less than the amount anticipated for tuition and required fees based on > sound actuarial principles. If in any fiscal year there is not enough money > in the Texas tomorrow fund to pay the tuition and required fees of an > institution of higher education in which a beneficiary enrolls or the > appropriate portion of the tuition and required fees of a private or > independent institution of higher education in which a beneficiary enrolls > as provided by a prepaid tuition contract, there is appropriated out of the > first money coming into the state treasury in each fiscal year not otherwise > appropriated by the constitution the amount that is sufficient to pay the > applicable amount of tuition and required fees of the institution. > (c) Assets of the fund may be invested by an entity designated by general > law in securities considered prudent investments.

A February 19, 2007 article in the Daily Texan reported that the Texas Tomorrow Fund program is in debt due to rising tuition. By 2029 the program could be in debt for as much as $3.3 billion, running completely out of money by 2018, due to the difference in tuition rates between the state's projections and the actual cost of tuition at major public universities. (UT Austin tuition was $7,630 per year in 2007; the state had projected $5,332.) This gap is currently paid by the University out of tuition from non-Tomorrow Fund students and, as more students enroll using the Fund, universities must raise tuition to balance out the lack of income from Tomorrow Fund students. The International Office handles Texas Tomorrow Funds/Texas Guaranteed Tuition Plan requests only for students attending study abroad programs where they are not paying UT tuition rates  Restarting the program  An article May 18, 2007 in the Dallas Morning News reported that the Texas Tomorrow Fund will be reopened for new enrollment under a new name:Originally planned to be called the Texas Tomorrow Fund II, it ended up being called the Texas Tuition Promise Fund. The Texas Tuition Promise Fund launched September 10, 2008. Under this program there are three categories from which parents will be able to buy semester hours in units (a unit represents 1% of a year's tuition, based on two semesters of 15 credit-hours each), with prices based on the type of college the student plans to attend. The most expensive level is flagship public universities, followed by other four-year public institutions, followed by two-year community colleges. If the student enrolls in a college more expensive than the weighted average for their level of plan, they will have to pay the difference (either with extra units or with money from other sources), ensuring that this program should not experience the shortfall problems of the previous program.  Substantial program changes  On August 24, 2009 the Texas Prepaid Higher Education Tuition Board published a substantial change to the contract terms of the program., Changes to Texas Tomorrow Fund Master Plan Previously, when contracts were canceled, participants were refunded the current value of tuition and fees at the time of cancellation. As of November 1, 2009 participants will be refunded only the amount of their contributions minus any applicable account fees. On September 24, 2009, the Tuition Board published an amendment to the change a month earlier., TGTP Purchaser Follow Up Letter The deadline for refunds was extended until November 30, 2009. Participants cancel matured contracts will receive a refund based upon their contributions plus earnings, minus applicable fees. Participants who cancel unmatured contracts will receive the lump sum actuarial value of the contract, minus fees. On November 6, 2009, the Tuition Board published a partial policy reversal to the previous amendment, pending an approval vote by the Board on December 23, 2009., TGTP Proposed Amendment Those who have withdrawn funds based upon the previous rule change in September may rescind their cancellation by December 31, 2009. Those who choose to opt out of the plan (and receive either actual tuition-based earnings or lump sum actuarial value) may do so through January 31, 2010., TGTP Refund Rule Change  See also  *Guaranteed Education Tuition Program, a similar program in Washington state  References  External links  * Constitutional basis for Texas Tomorrow Fund * Official Texas Tomorrow Fund website * Official Texas Tuition Promise Fund website * February 19, 2007 Daily Texan article: Tomorrow Fund in up to $3.3 billion hole * May 18, 2007 Dallas Morning News article: Senate OKs scaled-down Texas Tomorrow Fund * September 10, 2008 press release: Texas Comptroller Susan Combs Introduces the Texas Tuition Promise Fund For Texas Families to Achieve College Savings Goals Category:Education in Texas Category:Education finance in the United States ","title":"Texas Tomorrow Fund"},{"id":"3757935","text":"Giovanni Micheletto (Sacile, 21 January 1889 -- Sacile, 29 September 1958) was an Italian professional road racing cyclist, nicknamed by fans \\"The Sacile Count\\" (from his native town in the province of Pordenone) and \\"Nan√®\\".

Source: Collection of C.Michael Hogan Albert Chevallier Tayler (1862-1925) was an English artist who specialised in portrait and genre painting, but was also involved in the plein air methods of the Newlyn School. He studied at Heatherley's School of Art, Royal Academy Schools and with avant-garde painters in Paris. He was educated at Bloxham School in Oxfordshire. Early years with the Newlyn School He is most known for his twelve-year involvement with the Newlyn School of painting. The Newlyn school was spawned after many international artists followed the En plein air school in France, whereby artists would leave Paris and take up rural life in small colonies of kindred painters. Thence, as artists returned from France to their own countries, they sought out remote locations to congregate and pursue the En plein air method. The Newlyn School is also known as British Impressionism. A typical painting of this early period is A Dress Rehearsal (1888), hung in the National Museums Liverpool. This painting makes use of light and shadow and is based upon a genre scene as might have occurred in Cornwall. The Newlyn School drew their subjects from everyday life in the local area. Other associate artists of the Newlyn School were Henry Scott Tuke, Thomas Cooper Gotch, Caroline Gotch, Stanhope Forbes, Leghe Suthers, Walter Langley and Elizabeth Armstrong. The London era Portrait of WG Grace, painted 1905 During the 1890s he maintained connections with the art centre of London and exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy; however, at about the turn of the century he moved to London and converted to a more genteel, urban lifestyle. Tayler began painting more grand scenes of the cities of Europe. In 1901 he painted one of his largest and most masterful works, The Ceremony of the Garter, depicting the famous late Middle Ages scene at Eltham Palace in which the fallen garter of Joan of Kent is picked up by King Edward III. This event circa 1348 led to Edward III founding the Order of the Garter. By 1903 Tayler was renowned and was commissioned to paint a large panel at the Royal Exchange in London; the resultant painting of The Five Kings depicts Kings Edward III of England, David of Scotland, Peter I of Cyprus, John of France and Waldemar IV of Denmark partaking in a feast hosted by the Master of the Society of Vintners in London in 1363.From the official website of the Society of Vintners Tayler was an avid cricketer, and in 1905 produced a set of twelve watercolours of famous and mostly royal cricket players. Lord Leverhulme used the series to produce lithographs and advertise his Lever Brothers soap products. The promotion proved popular, and the National Portrait Gallery, London has nine of these images hanging. In 1906 he painted a famous picture of a cricket match in progress, Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury, which was commissioned by Kent. In June 2006, the county sold the painting at auction for ¬£680,000, a record price for a cricket painting.Auction feat for cricket painting. bbc.co.uk, 27 June 2006.

He was the son of Cenn F√°elad, and grandson of M√°el Coba, of the Cen√©l Conaill. While most early abbots of Iona were members of Cen√©l Conaill they came from minor branches of the kindred, but D√∫nchad came from the ruling line, grandson of one High King of Ireland and the nephew of two others, Cellach and Conall. He is first heard of as Abbot of Killochuir on the coast of southeastern Ulster (perhaps Killough, County Down). He later become Abbot of Iona, although there is considerable dispute about this matter. The Annals of Ulster first mention him in that capacity in the year 706; but Conamail of Iona is said to have been the abbot of Iona from 704 through 710. It is possible that Dunchad served as a coadjutor (or principatum tenuit) of Conamail of Iona. He himself may have been elected in opposition to Abbot Conamail, while Dorbb√©ne in 713 and F√°elch√∫ in 716 may have been elected to oppose D√∫nchad. It has also been suggested that at least some of these people may have coadjutors, priors, or possibly even bishops at Iona at the time. The final agreement about the dating of Easter on Iona took place at the instance of St. Ecgberht of Northumbria, a priest who had been educated in Ireland, who was successful in persuading the community to abandon the Celtic Easter and tonsure. When D√∫nchad died in 717, F√°elch√∫ continued in his position. In the same year of D√∫nchad's death, King Nechtan mac Derile, the Gaelic ruler of the Picts, allegedly expelled the Ionan clergy from Pictland. His feast day is 25 May.

The Grade I listed hall is set in period gardens surrounded by of country park. The house was built for John Batt. A recarved stone dated 1583 probably indicates the date of construction. The estate had been purchased by Batt's Halifax-born father, a receiver of rents to the Savile family, who resided at Howley Hall in Batley. Oakwell Hall was immortalised in literature as \\"Fieldhead\\" by Charlotte Bront√´, in her novel Shirley. It is used in many TV productions, most recently the ITV drama Victoria (UK TV series)  History  John Batt built the hall after the estate had been purchased by his father, a receiver of rents for the Savile family, who resided at Howley Hall in Batley. The hall was built in gritstone to a post-medieval plan with a central hall flanked by crosswings. Its entrance is through a porch and screens passage at the lower end of the house. A recarved stone dated 1583 probably indicates the date of construction. Oakwell Hall passed into municipal hands in 1928 and is owned and managed by Kirklees Council. The hall is supported by volunteers from the Friends of Oakwell Hall. The hall's interiors were restored to a late-17th-century condition, the time the Batt family lived here, with the aid of research into local inventories . During restoration the original painted panelling of the great parlour and the painted chamber was revealed from under layers of varnish and paint. The BBC Television series Gunpowder (2017) used Oakwell Hall as a location. Interior The Great Hall originally had two storeys but, in the mid-17th century, John Batt's grandson removed the ceiling and inserted a gallery and a large mullioned and transomed window. It was the main thoroughfare for the house linking the wings and hub of domestic life. It was a reception room for visitors, tenants and businessmen and large gatherings. It is sparsely furnished and uncluttered. The table is placed at one end of the room as it would have been towards the end of the 17th century, rather than in its earlier position in the centre. The size of the room is intended to impress visitors. The Great Parlour was the most important room in the early 17th century. According to the inventory of 1611 it had the best furniture, and contained the Batt family's collection of maps. In the 1630s the Batts added a magnificent plaster ceiling and painted the oak panelling including a landscape scene above the fireplace. Most of the original panels have survived. The painting technique known as scumbling was a way of decorating to create an air of warmth and grandeur. Few examples of this decorative work survive today. In the late-17th century, dining rooms and parlours were the preferred rooms for eating and entertaining guests in private. The great parlour is furnished with pieces intended to show it as a fashionable and comfortable room of the 1690s. In 1690, the Great Parlour Chamber was occupied by John Batt. It has a garderobe in the outer wall. The rush matting in this and other family rooms was a feature of wealthy households, and was warmer than bare floorboards or stone floors. The fireplace is a 19th-century addition, one of few interior structural changes made since the 17th century. The inclusion of a table and chairs in a bed chamber in the 17th century was not unusual. Bed chambers had a dual purpose where their occupiers thought nothing of entertaining guests with wine or cards. The kitchen was one of the busiest rooms in the home. The mistress supervised female servants preparing food, medicines and pot-pourri, and there would be a stream of tradesmen, estate workers, errand boys and servants of visiting gentry. At meal times the servants gathered to eat from wooden platters. When the hall was built, food may have been cooked over a large fire at one end of the Great Hall but, by the time of the inventory of 1611, the kitchen occupied a separate room in the east wing. The kitchen is divided from the living quarters by the screens passage. The 17th-century fireplace, replaced in the 19th century, would have been wider and larger. The Kitchen Chamber is where the servants slept and food was stored. It is unpanelled and has no ceiling. Its position next to the back stairs and above the kitchen made it accessible to the servants. Many local houses used their kitchen chambers for storage. In 1611 it had five arks for storing meal and grain. Today it has one great ark and a collection of food chests. Lack of a fireplace and unpanelled walls would have made it cold in winter, although warmth from the kitchen below would keep the stored food dry. The inventory of 1611 records the household had 17 beds of different types, truckle beds for the servants and grand tester beds for members of the family. Older beds were relegated to less important rooms. The Little Parlour Chamber is furnished with older furniture and used as a second-best bedchamber. Reproduction tapestries are hung on the walls. In the 19th century, this room was transformed with the addition of the stairs and passage. The original timber studding can be seen on two walls, showing the lath and plaster structure. The layout of the New Parlour shows typical features of a modest 17th-century dining room. Servants placed food on the side table, and served it to the family. The court cupboard housed pewter and plate and could be locked as could the small corner spice cupboard, the key kept by the mistress, as spices were valuable commodities. A gentry household in the 17th century accommodated visitors. The New Parlour Chamber, displayed as a second-best bed chamber, may have been occupied by the nursemaid and her charges, or other members of the household. The screen at right angles to the doorway prevented draughts through the bed curtains. An adjoining dressing room or closet is used to display reproduction costumes. The warm colours of the panelling and bed curtains are echoed in the carpet on the table, a feature of wealthier 17th- century houses. Tables or beds were ideal places to display a fine carpet too valuable to walk upon. The Painted Chamber is furnished with reproduction oak furniture to show what it looked like when new (not dark with age and polish). The painted panelling has a larger design than that the Great Parlour and is less decorative. It was discovered under layers of emulsion paint and thought to date from the 17th century. The room is displayed as the mistress's chamber; a small table by the window obtains the maximum light for sewing. The floorboards have been relaid in a 17th-century manner. In 1609, a floor was laid at a cost of five shillings and tenpence for seven days' work, as recorded in the account book. The painted panelling creates a three- dimensional effect imitating the grainy effect of wood. The wild 'squiggles' were intended to imitate walnut, a wood becoming more fashionable in the late-17th century. It was expensive so painting was used to imitate it. The paint had a linseed oil base, and feathers and combs were dragged over it to create the grained effect. The study is a small room off the gallery above the Main Hall. The 1611 inventory of Robert Batt shows him to have more than 60 books, at a time when books were expensive and few people could read. He studied at Oxford University and became rector at Newton Tony in Wiltshire.  Grounds  A Stone Ram statue, rumoured to have stood above the gates to Dewsbury Brewery, stands on the lawn in front of the hall.  Formal gardens  The exterior of the hall Surrounding the hall are formal gardens including a herb garden at the side. Herbs and flowers were essential ingredients for the housewife and cook. They were distilled to produce scented oils and are the basis of herbal remedies and had an important culinary role. Although Oakwell's herb garden is small, it gives an impression of the range of herbal plants available. More than 80 varieties of herbs are found in the garden and many more planted amongst the flowers in the formal gardens behind the hall. Restoration has been carried out to return the formal gardens to how they would have been in the 1690s using plants popular at the time. The garden contains a parterre with topiary specimens and clipped box hedging. The patterns of the box hedges were taken from furniture and plaster work in the hall and feature the lozenge design local to the area. Trellis has been made using locally sourced materials and 17th-century carpentry techniques. Even the shade of green used to colour the woodwork is typical of the period.  Parkland  Within the of parkland are many diverse habitats: woodland, streams, pasture land, ponds and bridleways. Nature trail marker indicate several walks around the park. Information points give details of the flora and fauna. One walk out of the park leads to the site of the Battle of Adwalton Moor and another to Red House (now closed). Colliery Field, the pasture land in the middle of the park was the site of the spoil heaps of Gomersal Colliery which closed in the 1970s. The nutrient-poor soil has been reseeded with meadow plants such as red clover, ox-eye daisy, self heal and yellow rattle. The nectar-rich flowers attract insects, particularly bumblebees. The field is sometimes used for historical English Civil War battle re-enactments, horse shows and country fairs. Colliery pond was created when the National Coal Board constructed a concrete road to facilitate tipping. The road is concealed beneath the grass and acts as a dam. Water plants include water forget-me-not, bogbean and purple loosestrife. Large numbers of creatures are attracted to the pond, such as toads, moorhens, smooth newts, swan mussels plus varieties of damselfly and dragonfly. Nova Meadow is damp area containing moisture loving plants including lady's smock, common tussock grass, meadowsweet, ragged robin and yellow flag iris. A pond was created in 2003 to attract wildlife and the southern part of the meadow has reverted to scrubland creating a habitat for yellowhammers and linnets. In autumn it attracts thrushes, fieldfares and redwings which feed on the hawthorn berries. Much of Nova Wood was coppiced for pit props for Gomersal Colliery but the trees have regrown to produce multi-stemmed sessile oaks and birch. Nova Wood is carpeted by bluebells during spring and is a habitat for summer migrant birds such as chiffchaff and blackcap. Nova Beck is one of two streams that run through Oakwell, both running north to south. Nova Beck forms the western boundary of Nova Wood and flows through areas of wildflowers. Many of the species present such as yellow archangel, wood anemone and wild garlic are good indicators of ancient woodland. Hard shield fern, red campion and herb bennet grow in abundance. Oakwell Beck winds its course along the southern boundary of Colliery Field. Along its length are exposed coal seams and fossilized 'ripples' from ancient seas. It does not support the same diversity of plants as Nova Beck, but in spring and early summer, the wooded areas are thick with wild garlic, lesser celandine and bistort. Occasional patches of lords and ladies survive in shadier parts. ash, alder and willow make up the majority of the tree cover and provide habitat for tawny owls.  Ghost  A legend concerns the ghost of William Batt, aged 25, a bachelor whose widowed mother, Elizabeth, lived at Oakwell. An account of the story was written by Mrs Gaskell in her Life of Charlotte Bront√´ (1857). Her account is as follows: \\"Captain Batt was believed to be far away; his family was at Oakwell; when in the dusk on winter evening, he came stalking along the lane, through the hall and up the stairs, into his own room, where he vanished. He has been killed in duel in London that very same afternoon of December 9th 1684.\\" The legend says that he left a bloody footprint in a bedroom. The historical facts from the archives show that Batt was at the Black Swan, in Holborn, London on 9 December where he borrowed money. Local diarist Oliver Heywood has two entries recording his death; one that he died 'in sport'; the other that he was 'slain by Mr Gream at Barne near London'. Batt was buried in Birstall on 30 December 1684  Bront√´ connection  In the 19th century the hall was used as a girls' school. Charlotte Bront√´'s closest friend Ellen Nussey (who she first met at Roe Head school) lived in Birstall and almost certainly brought her to see the school at Oakwell as Charlotte was considering setting up a school at Haworth with her sisters. Charlotte Bront√´ visited the hall and was inspired to use it as the setting for the manor house, Fieldhead, in her novel Shirley. \\"If Fieldhead had few other merits as a building, it might at least be termed picturesque: its irregular architecture, and the grey and mossy colouring communicated by time, gave it a just claim to this epithet. The old latticed windows, the stone porch, the walls, the roof, the chimney-stacks, were rich in crayon touches and sepia lights and shades. The trees behind were fine, bold, and spreading; the cedar on the lawn in front was grand, and the granite urns on the garden wall, the fretted arch of the gateway, were, for an artist, as the very desire of the eye.\\" Charlotte Bront√´; Shirley (1849) Elizabeth Gaskell described the house when discussing Shirley: \\"From the ‚ÄòBloody Lane‚Äô, overshadowed by trees, you come into the field in which Oakwell Hall is situated... The enclosure in front, half court, half garden; the panelled hall, with the gallery opening into the bed-chambers running round; the barbarous peach-coloured drawing- room; the bright look-out through the garden-door upon the grassy lawns and terraces behind, where the soft-hued pigeons still love to coo and strut in the sun, ‚Äì are described in Shirley. The scenery of that fiction lies close around; the real events which suggested it took place in the immediate neighbourhood.\\" Elizabeth Gaskell; The Life of Charlotte Bront√´ (1857) Oakwell is a trailhead on the Bront√´ Way, a long-distance footpath that skirts Bradford to Haworth then crosses the South Pennines, continuing to Gawthorpe Hall, Padiham, Lancashire.  Friends of Oakwell Hall  250px Founded in 1988, the Friends of Oakwell Hall and Country Park are a voluntary support group for the manor house and its surrounding of country park. Friends work with the Head Ranger and staff at Oakwell and provide assistance inside and outside the hall.  Archaeology  Archaeological excavations have been carried out by WYAS with help from 'South Leeds Archaeology', a community group based in Rothwell. In May 2008 the lawn in front of the hall was excavated to reveal post holes, probably left from a farm that occupied the site and disappeared from maps between 1834 and 1844.

For several decades, members of government, the judiciary and the media made repeated allegations that Saffron was involved in a wide range of criminal activities, including illegal alcohol sales, dealing in stolen goods, illegal gambling, prostitution, drug dealing, bribery and extortion. He was charged with a range of offences including \\"scandalous conduct\\", possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of stolen goods, but his only major conviction was for federal tax evasion. He gained nationwide notoriety in the media, earning various nicknames including \\"Mr Sin\\", \\"a Mr Big of Australian crime\\" and \\"the boss of the Cross\\" (a reference to the Kings Cross red-light district, where he owned numerous businesses). He was alleged to have been involved in police corruption and bribing politicians. Saffron always vigorously denied such accusations, and was renowned for the extent to which he was willing to sue for libel against his accusers.Radio transcript: Early life Saffron was born in Annandale, New South Wales in 1919, of Russian Jewish descent. He was educated at Annandale and Leichhardt primary schools and at the highly prestigious Fort Street High School. Although his mother hoped he would become a doctor, Saffron left school at 15 and began his business career in the family's drapery firm in the late 1930s. He enlisted in the Australian army on 5 August 1940, and reached the rank of corporal before being discharged 4 January 1944. Saffron did not serve overseas. Saffron then served in the Merchant Navy from January to June 1944. Career Upon leaving the Merchant Navy, he became involved with a notorious Sydney nightclub called The Roosevelt Club, co-owned by \\"prominent Sydney businessman\\" Sammy Lee. It is claimed that Saffron began his rise to power in the Sydney underworld through his involvement in the lucrative sale of black-market alcohol at the Roosevelt. At the time, NSW clubs and pubs were subject to strict licensing laws which limited trading hours and regulated alcohol prices and sale conditions. When Saffron began working at the Roosevelt, alcohol sales were also subject to wartime rationing regulations. A subsequent Royal Commission into the NSW liquor trade heard evidence that in the early 1950s The Roosevelt Club was clearing over ¬£1000 per week in alcohol sales, of which only ¬£100 was being banked as liquor takings. In 1947, Saffron, in partnership with Hilton Granville Kincaid and Mendel Brunen, took over the ownership of the Roosevelt. In January 1953, the club was closed after being declared a \\"disorderly house\\" by the NSW Police Commissioner. After Saffron sold the Roosevelt, it was able to be re-opened. Saffron then relocated to Newcastle; he worked there for a time as a bookmaker, but it has been reported that he was not successful. When questioned by a Royal Commission about how he had obtained the substantial sum (¬£3000) with which he bought his first pub licence in Newcastle, he claimed that the money had come from savings he had accumulated from his bookmaking activity, although he was notably vague when pressed about the exact sources of this income. In 1948 Saffron returned to Sydney and began purchasing licences for a string of Sydney pubs. It was later alleged that he also established covert controlling interests in numerous other pubs through a series of \\"dummy\\" owners. The 1954 Maxwell Royal Commission heard evidence that Saffron used these pubs to obtain legitimately purchased alcohol, diverting it to the various nightclubs and other businesses that he operated and selling at black market prices, realising vast profits. By the 1960s Saffron owned or controlled a string of nightclubs, strip joints and sex shops in Kings Cross, including the Sydney club Les Girls, home of the famous transvestite revue. During this period he began to expand his business operations into \\"legitimate\\" enterprises and to establish holdings in other states, such as the Raffles Hotel, Perth, leading several state governments to launch inquiries into his activities. International connections The Australian Commonwealth Police alleged that Mr Saffron met with Chicago mobster, Joseph Dan Testa, in 1969, while Testa was in Australia.\\"Mr. Big called a 'vicious criminal'\\". The Age. (1 February 1974). Juanita Nielsen disappearance One of the most contentious incidents in Saffron's career was his rumoured involvement in the disappearance and presumed murder of newspaper publisher and anti-development campaigner Juanita Nielsen in July 1975. Although no direct connection to the crime was ever established, Saffron was shown to have had proven connections with several people suspected of being involved in Nielsen's disappearance. Saffron owned the Carousel nightclub in Kings Cross, where Nielsen was last seen on the day of her disappearance; his long-serving deputy James McCartney Anderson managed the club; one of the men later convicted of conspiring to kidnap Nielsen was Eddie Trigg, the night manager of the club; it was also reported that Saffron had financial links with developer Frank Theeman, against whose development Nielsen was campaigning. Expos√© In the 1980s investigative journalist David Hickie published his landmark book The Prince and The Premier, which included a substantial section detailing Saffron's alleged involvement in many aspects of organised crime in Sydney. The book's central thesis was that former NSW Premier Robert Askin was corrupt, that Askin and Police Commissioners Norman Allan and Fred Hanson received huge bribes from the illegal gaming industry over many years, and that Askin and other senior public officials had overseen and approved of a major expansion of organised crime in New South Wales. Using only material that was already in the public domain, obtained from evidence tendered to royal commissions and allegations made by politicians under parliamentary privilege, Hickie devoted an entire section of his book to Saffron's business activities. Among the most damning material was the detailed evidence tendered to the 1954 Maxwell Royal Commission into the NSW liquor trade, which concluded that Saffron had established covert controlling interests in numerous NSW pubs to supply his \\"sly grog\\" outlets, and that he had systematically made false statements to the Commission and sworn false oaths before the NSW Licensing Court. Furthermore, in the second edition of The Politics of Heroin by Alfred W. McCoy, in a chapter summarising the Nugan Hand Bank it is mentioned that Askin and Saffron regularly had dinner together at the Bourbon and Beefsteak Bar and Restaurant, owned by American expatriate Maurice Bernard Houghton. pages 461‚Äì472 of Politics of Heroin, 2nd edition The NSW Police were unable to effect any substantial convictions against Saffron over a period of almost 40 years, which only served to reinforce the public concerns about his alleged influence over state police and government officials, but after the establishment of the National Crime Authority in the 1980s, he became a major target for the new federal investigative body. Tax evasion In November 1987, following an extensive investigation by the NCA and the Australian Taxation Office, Saffron was found guilty of tax evasion. His conviction was largely made possible by evidence provided by his former associate Jim Anderson, who testified that Saffron's clubs routinely kept two sets of accounts‚Äîone set of so-called \\"black\\" books, which recorded actual turnover, and another set (\\"white\\" books) which were purposely fabricated with the intent of evading tax by falsifying income. Despite several legal appeals, Saffron served 17 months in jail. Judge Loveday said on sentencing \\"In my view the maximum penalty of three years is inadequate.\\" Saffron undertook a number of highly publicised defamation cases against various publications; he unsuccessfully sued The Sydney Morning Herald but was successful in later suits against the authors, publishers and distributors of Tough: 101 Australian Gangsters and the publishers of The Gold Coast Bulletin, which contained a defamatory crossword clue. The crossword clue was: \\"Sydney underworld figure, nicknamed Mr Sin (3,7).\\" Death Prior to his death he lived in retirement at Surry Hills, Sydney. Abe Saffron died at St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in 2006, aged 86. He was interred next to his wife, Doreen, at Rookwood Cemetery, Sydney. Legacy In November 2006 the Sydney Daily Telegraph reported that Saffron's son Alan, would receive only $500,000 from his father's multimillion-dollar estate; the article quoted various estimates of the value of the estate that ranged from A$30 million to as much as $140 million. The article reported that Saffron's eight grandchildren (including Alan Saffron's five children) would receive $1 million each, Saffron's mistress Teresa Tkaczyk would receive a lifetime annuity of $1000 a week and the couple's apartments in Surry Hills, Elizabeth Bay and the Gold Coast and that Melissa Hagenfelds (Saffron's daughter by his former mistress Rita Hagenfelds) would also receive a $1,000 a week annuity and apartments at Centennial Park and Elizabeth Bay. Other reported provisions of the will included bequests of up to $10 million to various charities.Warren Owens: \\"Abe Saffron's son angry over will\\" ‚Äì Daily Telegraph, 5 November 2006 In May 2007 the Sydney Morning Herald published an article on Saffron's reputed involvement in the infamous Ghost Train fire at Luna Park Sydney in 1979, when a suspected arson attack destroyed the popular ride, killing seven people. In an interview with Herald journalist Kate McClymont, Saffron's niece Anne Buckingham linked Saffron to the fire, stating that her uncle \\"liked to collect things\\" and that he intended to purchase Luna Park.McClymont, Kate: \\"Niece links Abe Saffron to Luna Park deaths\\"; Sydney Morning Herald, 25 May 2007 At the time of the fire, the park was being leased to property developer Leon Fink (businessman) and his partner, who told the Herald that he had been stopped from purchasing the park by the then state ALP government of Neville Wran‚Äîreputedly because Fink's business partner Nathan Spatt had made derogatory comments about Wran's use of a private aircraft belonging to Sir Peter Abeles‚Äîand Fink said that Wran once said to him at a function: \\"While my bum points to the ground, your partner will not get that lease.\\" The Herald story also stated that a parliamentary report revealed that then Deputy Premier Jack Ferguson had told John Ducker (head of the Labor Council of New South Wales) that Wran had decided that Fink would not get Wran's support because he did not donate enough money to the ALP. In August 2007, Allen & Unwin published the first major biography of Saffron, written by investigative journalist Tony Reeves, author of the 2005 biography of notorious Sydney gangster Lenny McPherson. In July 2008, Abe Saffron's son Alan returned to Australia from his home in the US to promote his memoir Gentle Satan: Abe Saffron, My Father and the publication of the book was widely covered in the Australian media. According to a Sydney Morning Herald report, Saffron's book names former Saffron associate James McCartney Anderson as the chief agent of the conspiracy to silence Juanita Nielsen. Anderson (who died in 2003) consistently denied any involvement while he was alive, but police reportedly failed to check Anderson's alibi that he was interstate when Nielsen disappeared. In an interview with Herald reporter Lisa Carty, Alan Saffron said that he had received death threats over the book because it would name some of the people involved in the Juanita Nielsen conspiracy, but that he was unable to name all those involved for legal reasons, because some were still alive. Saffron claimed he could name people \\"much bigger\\" than former NSW premier Robert Askin and former police commissioner Norman Allan, with whom his father corruptly dealt to protect his gambling, nightclub and prostitution businesses. Saffron specifically referred to: :... one particular businessman I was desperate to name, and there's one particular police officer who is extremely high ranking. They're the biggest names you can imagine in Australia. According to the Herald article, all the conspirators are named in the original manuscript of the book, which is now in the possession of Saffron's publishers, Penguin, and that the book would be re-published with additional names after people not originally named had died.Lisa Carty: \\"The only son of Mr Sin returns to scene of the his enemies\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 26 July 2008 A follow-up article published the next day carried Alan Saffron's assertion that his father controlled the vice trade, including illegal gambling and prostitution, in every state except Tasmania and the Northern Territory, and that he bribed \\"a host of politicians and policemen\\" to ensure he was protected from prosecution. Later in his career Abe Saffron reportedly began laundering his huge illegal income through loan sharking and that the late media magnate Kerry Packer was among those who borrowed money from Abe Saffron, allegedly to cover gambling debts. The book also alleges that Saffron lent money to several other prominent Sydney businessmen including Frank Theeman (whose controversial Kings Cross development was the target of Juanita Nielsen's campaign) as well as former TNT boss Sir Peter Abeles and property tycoon Sir Paul Strasser, both of whom received knighthoods during Askin's premiership. The book lends further weight to the long-standing allegations of corruption against former NSW Premier Robert Askin and Police Commissioner Norman Allan. It claims that Saffron made payments of between A$5000 and $10,000 per week to each man over many years, that Askin and Allan both visited Saffron's office on several occasions, that Allan also visited the Saffron family home, and that Abe Saffron paid for an all-expenses overseas trip for Allan and a young female 'friend'. Later in Askin's premiership, according to Alan Saffron, his father became the \\"bagman\\" for Sydney's illegal liquor and prostitution rackets and most illegal gambling activities, collecting payoffs that were then passed to Askin, Allan and others; in return his father was completely protected.Kate McClymont: \\"Saffron's son: Dad paid off Askin and lent Packer money\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 27 July 2008 It was reported on 9 October 2011 that Abe also fathered another son, Adam Brand.

He was Director of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology between 1908 and 1931. Early life Hunt was born in London to Edwin Hunt, a marine engineer, and his wife Annie (n√©e Padley). As a child, he spent three years in St Petersburg with his father who was managing the Baltic Ironworks and designing battleship engines for the Russian Czar. On his return to England he won a scholarship in mathematics to Dartford Grammar School in Kent. In March 1884 his family emigrated to Sydney, Australia. Career Hunt began working with the government astronomer Henry Chamberlain Russell at the Observatory, becoming a meteorological assistant in January 1886, and promoted to second meteorological assistant in 1890. In this role he was responsible for the daily weather report, and also worked with Russell's project studying anti- cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1894 his work was recognised with the Ralph Abercromby prize for \\"An Essay on Southerly Bursters\\", and also the next year with \\"Types of Australian Weather\\", a wide-ranging survey on meteorology in Australia. He was appointed head meteorologist in 1904, and immediately sent on a world tour to survey the most modern meteorological techniques. In late 1906, Hunt, by now a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society, was appointed inaugural head of the nascent Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau in Melbourne, the agency responsible for developing and unifying Australian meteorological services to satisfy the developing needs of industry. On 20-23 May 1907 Hunt convened a conference in Melbourne intended to standardise meteorological practices throughout Australia. As a result of his efforts, a unified national service was created, and began operating on 1 January 1908. As head meteorologist, his expert advice was also consulted on the climate of the proposed new seat of government at Yass-Canberra. Initially, Hunt's main area of research was synoptic meteorology, but in 1913 he co-authored (with Griffith Taylor and E.T. Quayle) a textbook, The Climate and Weather of Australia, the first of its kind in Australia. He developed a number of new meteorological theories, collected in a 1929 book A basis for seasonal forecasting in Australia. In this book he proposed a four-year weather cycle, according to which non-meteorological factors such as vegetation were causally linked to weather patterns. This theory led to new research into the relationship between the weather cycle and droughts. Before his forced retirement on 6 February 1931, Hunt was considered the foremost weather expert in Australia with an estimated 87% strike rate. One of his most highly regarded achievements was his successful battle, through the First World War and Great Depression, to obtain the resources to grow and professionalise Australia's meteorological service to meet the demands of military and industry. Personal life and public persona As a public figure in charge of an often fallible, yet necessary proto-science, the \\"somewhat reserved and mild-mannered\\" Hunt was often lampooned by the Australian press, particularly the satirical Melbourne Punch, who regularly featured him humorously, if affectionately, in the \\"People We Know\\" series. The magazine described him as \\"a pleasant, meek, well-fed gentleman, who seems quite out of place in control of such an untameable gang as the Australian weather elements... it would be hard to say what his percentage of correct predictions is, but this is certain, that it would be a high one\\". Outside of his public profile Hunt was a reserved and private person, with a passion for chess, and was an expert handyman and amateur inventor. His innovations included a 'rotating rain clock' and a pressure-cube anemometer to record wind pressure, velocity and direction simultaneously. He died of myocarditis at his home in Elwood, Victoria on his 80th birthday and was buried in Brighton cemetery. On 11 December 1899 at St Paul's Church of England, Redfern, Sydney, he had married Wilhelmina Eve Linden, who predeceased him. Two of their three daughters survived him.

In graph theory, an edge contraction is an operation which removes an edge from a graph while simultaneously merging the two vertices that it previously joined. Edge contraction is a fundamental operation in the theory of graph minors. Vertex identification is a less restrictive form of this operation.  Definition  The edge contraction operation occurs relative to a particular edge, e. The edge e is removed and its two incident vertices, u and v, are merged into a new vertex w, where the edges incident to w each correspond to an edge incident to either u or v. More generally, the operation may be performed on a set of edges by contracting each edge (in any order). The resulting induced graph is sometimes written as G/e. (Contrast this with G \\\\setminus e which means removing the edge e.) Contracting an edge without creating multiple edges. As defined below, an edge contraction operation may result in a graph with multiple edges even if the original graph was a simple graph.Also, loops may arise when the graph started with multiple edges or, even if the graph was simple, from the repeated application of edge contraction. However, some authors disallow the creation of multiple edges, so that edge contractions performed on simple graphs always produce simple graphs. Formal definition Let G = (V, E) be a graph (or directed graph) containing an edge e = (u, v) with u eq v. Let f be a function which maps every vertex in V \\\\setminus{u, v} to itself, and otherwise, maps it to a new vertex w. The contraction of e results in a new graph G' = (V', E'), where V' = (V \\\\setminus{u, v})\\\\cup{w}, E' = E \\\\setminus {e}, and for every x \\\\in V, x' = F(x)\\\\in V' is incident to an edge e' \\\\in E' if and only if, the corresponding edge, e \\\\in E is incident to x in G. Vertex identification Vertex identification (sometimes called vertex contraction) removes the restriction that the contraction must occur over vertices sharing an incident edge. (Thus, edge contraction is a special case of vertex identification.) The operation may occur on any pair (or subset) of vertices in the graph. Edges between two contracting vertices are sometimes removed. If v and v' are vertices of distinct components of G, then we can create a new graph G' by identifying v and v' in G as a new vertex \\\\textbf{v} in G'. More generally, given a partition of the vertex set, one can identify vertices in the partition; the resulting graph is known as a quotient graph. Vertex cleaving Vertex cleaving which is the same as vertex splitting, means one vertex is being split into two, where these two new vertices are adjacent to the vertices that the original vertex was adjacent to. This is the reverse operation of vertex identification. Path contraction Path contraction occurs upon the set of edges in a path that contract to form a single edge between the endpoints of the path. Edges incident to vertices along the path are either eliminated, or arbitrarily (or systematically) connected to one of the endpoints. Twisting Given two disjoint graphs G_1 and G_2, where G_1 contains vertices u_1 and v_1 and G_2 contains vertices u_2 and v_2. Suppose we can obtain the graph G by identifying the vertices u_1 of G_1 and u_2 of G_2 as the vertex u of G and identifying the vertices v_1 of G_1 and v_2 of G_2 as the vertex v of G. In a twisting G' of G with respect to the vertex set {u, v}, we identify, instead, u_1 with v_2 and v_1 with u_2.  Applications  Both edge and vertex contraction techniques are valuable in proof by induction on the number of vertices or edges in a graph, where it can be assumed that a property holds for all smaller graphs and this can be used to prove the property for the larger graph. Edge contraction is used in the recursive formula for the number of spanning trees of an arbitrary connected graph, and in the recurrence formula for the chromatic polynomial of a simple graph. Contractions are also useful in structures where we wish to simplify a graph by identifying vertices that represent essentially equivalent entities. One of the most common examples is the reduction of a general directed graph to an acyclic directed graph by contracting all of the vertices in each strongly connected component. If the relation described by the graph is transitive, no information is lost as long as we label each vertex with the set of labels of the vertices that were contracted to form it. Another example is the coalescing performed in global graph coloring register allocation, where vertices are contracted (where it is safe) in order to eliminate move operations between distinct variables. Edge contraction is used in 3D modelling packages (either manually, or through some feature of the modelling software) to consistently reduce vertex count, aiding in the creation of low- polygon models.

History Arrow Films was established in 1991. After the release of Zombie Flesh Eaters in 2012, film restorer James White stated that the label would try and revamp their brand to \\"focus on high-quality presentations of classic and cult cinema\\". White has stated that prior to Zombie Flesh Eaters, the label had a less favorable reception and that \\"a lot of those criticisms were valid. But people should understand that Arrow weren't personally responsible for those masters. They sub-licensed those titles from the rightsholders and it was either put them out with the masters they'd been supplied with or not release them at all. It's an unfortunate position that a lot of independent labels find themselves in.\\" In 2015, Daniel Graham left Arrow to head distribution at CinemaLive. Divisions=Arrow Films Arrow Films is one of the U.K.'s leading independent distributors of world cinema, art house, horror and classic films. On 4 December 2009, Arrow Films released Departures in the United Kingdom theatrically; it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2009 Oscars. Arrow Video Arrow Video is a specialist label that encapsulates the spirit of the video nasties of the 1980s, including retro- style artwork and posters. This label includes films by renowned horror directors George A. Romero, Lucio Fulci, Lamberto Bava and Dario Argento. Each title is released completely uncut, usually with new transfers, and with a choice between the original audio track and usually a lossless 5.1. Brand-new, specially commissioned artwork alongside the original release artwork are included on each release. Newly made and exclusive booklets are often accompanied with the Blu-ray/DVD. Also included are new extra features for each Blu-ray/DVD, with new interviews and documentaries. In August 2011, the Sony/PIAS warehouse fire in Enfield, North London during the 2011 England riots affected the release schedule and led to a substantial loss of stock. ArrowDrome In September 2011, Arrow Films launched a new sublabel, ArrowDrome, which includes new releases and several titles from the Arrow Video label being re-released. These new editions include reversible DVD sleeves, collectable booklets and extra features. The aim of ArrowDrome is to release DVD titles only at budget prices. The collection includes these categories: *ArrowDrome Action *ArrowDrome Erotic *ArrowDrome Giallo *ArrowDrome Horror *ArrowDrome Mystery *ArrowDrome Samurai *ArrowDrome Sci-fi *ArrowDrome Blaxploitation Arrow Video USA In 2014, Arrow Films launched a successful Indiegogo campaign to begin releasing Blu-ray Discs and DVDs in North America. It was intended to begin with Blood and Black Lace, but rights holding issues shelved this release until July 2016. Arrow Video USA launched with the release of Mark of the Devil on March 17, 2014. They have, as of November 2016, released over 90 films collected across 70 releases, including several films that have never seen a Blu-ray Disc release. There have been a few exclusive North American Blu-ray Disc releases. Arrow began releasing films in the North American market in 2015. Francesco Simeoni, Arrow's head of production and acquisition stated that Arrow's desire to move into the North American market as \\"indicative of the transforming landscape of physical home entertainment distribution\\", noting that it was \\"not dying; it‚Äôs evolving.\\" Reception Arrow has been listed by The Guardian twice as their home video distributor of the year. In 2011, they listed Arrow as the Label of the Year noting their release of Bicycle Thieves, Rififi and Les Diaboliques and specifically praising their releases of horror films, where they \\"truly excel\\". The second time was in 2013 when they awarded Arrow Films \\"Label of the Year\\", noting their releases of Lifeforce and releases of television shows such as Borgen and The Killing as highlights. Camera Obscura: The Walerian Borowczyk Collection was voted the best home video release of 2014 by several publications, including Sight and Sound and Little White Lies, and won the Focal International Award for Best Archival Restoration Project and the Cinema Ritrovato Award for Best DVD Series/Best Box.

His plays have won numerous awards, including several for best Hungarian drama of the year. A few of them are available in English translation. The best known one is Chickenhead (1986), an earthy and bitter drama of a young delinquent's disillusionment at the longed- for reunion with his drunken father. Dramatic Exchange described it as \\"widely considered to be the most important Hungarian play of the last 20 years.\\" His avant-garde style, depicting coarse language and characters outside the pale of respectability, often dismayed more traditional Hungarian critics. His book, Az Ikszek (The X-s), which appeared in 1981, is a historical novel about the National Theatre of Poland in the first years of the 19th century, with Wojciech Bogus≈Çawski as the main character. The novel is about the fight of the artists against censorship. He published in 2005 an 800-page novel, Fogs√°g (Captivity).

Biography Russell's career began in 1836, when at the age of 22 he traveled to the US and, in three seasons, earned no less a sum than ¬£10,000. He subsequently lost this by investing in the United States Bank, which collapsed.Sala's Journal 6 May 1893. pp. 424‚Äì425 Russell wrote the song \\"A Life on the Ocean Wave\\" and the tune to George Pope Morris's poem Woodman, Spare that Tree while living in the US from 1836 to 1841, before settling in London to produce musical extravaganzas until he retired in 1857. Many of his songs championed social causes like abolition, temperance, and reform of mental asylums. Russell was born in Sheerness, Kent, a great-nephew of the British Chief Rabbi Solomon Hirschel. He began his career as a child singer in Elliston‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Opera company. While playing the organ at the Presbyterian church in Rochester, New York he discovered that sacred music, played quickly, \\"makes the best kind of secular music\\". Old Hundredth, played very fast, became the music for \\"Get Out of de Way, Ol' Dan Tucker\\". Russell's song \\"The Fine Old English Gentleman\\" 1831 was made fun of ten years later by Charles Dickens in his identically titled song. In 1841, he returned to England and performed at the Hanover Square Rooms in London with instant success. Many of his songs were written to lyrics by Charles Mackay, including \\"There's a Good Time Coming\\", \\"Cheer, Boys, Cheer\\", and \\"To The West\\". The Hutchinson Family Singers were fans of Russell's work and performed several of his tunes, including \\"The Maniac\\" and \\"The Ship On Fire.\\" After retirement, he lived partly in France, partly in England. His first wife was Christian; his second wife was Jewish and their family (including their sons, conductor Sir Landon Ronald and impresario Henry Russell) were raised in the Jewish religion. His portrait was painted by the British painter Walter Goodman and displayed in London at the Institute of Oil Painters in 1889 and at the Grafton Galleries in 1897. The Jewish Chronicle of 21 May that year describes the painting as depicting Russell hale and hearty with flowing beard. He died at 18 Howley Place, Maida Vale, on 8 December 1900, and his remains are interred in Kensal Green Cemetery. A detailed biography, A Life on the Ocean Wave: The Story of Henry Russell by Andrew Lamb, was published by Fullers Wood Press in 2007.

He was one of the most active Italian composers around 1400, and his style bridged the periods of the Trecento, ars subtilior, and beginnings of the musical Renaissance.Medieval Italy: an encyclopedia Volume 1 ‚Äì Page 65 Christopher Kleinhenz ‚Äì 2004 \\"Antonio Zacara da Teramo (died c. 1413‚Äì1415), who lived in Rome from at least 1390 to 1407, served as papal singer and scribe under popes Boniface IX, Innocent VII, and Gregory XII and was maestro di cappella in the chapel of the antipope John XXIII in 1412-141.\\" Life Antonio was probably from Teramo, in northern Abruzzo (Kingdom of Naples), not far from the Adriatic coast.Fallows, Grove online. The possibility that two different composers, \\"Antonio da Teramo\\" and \\"Zacara da Teramo\\", were conflated into one person was removed by research into the composer's life by Agostino Ziino.Ziino, 1979 (Another composer with a similar name, Nicolaus Zacharie, was of the following generation of composers). Antonio's nickname \\"Zaccara\\" (or \\"Zachara\\"; often regularized in modern editions as \\"Zacara\\") probably is a reference to his short stature (he is described as having \\"statura corporis parva\\" in a 15th-century biography).N√°das, 1986 The name Zacara means a small thing or a thing of little value; hence the reason why Antonio never used the nickname himself and documents produced in circles close to the composer are careful to call him some variation on \\"Antonius vulgatus dictus Zachara\\" (Anthony, commonly called Zacara).Zimei, 2004, passim. Nothing is known about his life until he is recorded in Rome, in 1390, as a teacher at the Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia; the document mentions that he was not young at the time of this appointment, but his exact age is not given.Fallows, Grove online. In the next year he became a secretary to Pope Boniface IX; the letter of appointment survives, and indicates that he was a married layman as well as a singer in the papal chapel. He stayed at this post through the papacies of Boniface IX (to 1404), Innocent VII (1404‚Äì1406), and Gregory XII (1406‚Äì1415). This was during the turbulent period of the Western Schism, and from his surviving letters, as well as the numerous hidden, and probably subversive political references in his music, Zacara seems to have been involved in the machinations of the time. It is not known exactly when he abandoned service to Pope Gregory, but if the ballata Dime Fortuna poy che tu parlasti is indeed by Zacara then we can read in its text evidence that he left Gregory before the Council of Pisa in 1409.Ziino 1994, 103‚Äì104. Supported in later publications by Margaret Bent (1998) and by Lucia Marchi (2003). He is recorded as a singer in the chapel of John XXIII in Bologna in 1412 and 1413. Two documents of 1416 (one or them dated 17 and 20 September) describe him as being already dead; he owned substantial property in Teramo as well as a house in Rome at the time of his death. The illuminated Squarcialupi Codex contains an illustration of him. He was a small man, and had a total of only ten digits altogether on both hands and feet, details which are not only evident in the portrait but mentioned in his entry in an 18th-century Abruzzi necrology.Pirrotta, \\"Zacara da Teramo,\\" p. 142. Music Studies on Zacara's music are all relatively recent, and much remains to be solved in terms of chronology and attribution. He seems to have been active as a composer throughout his life, and a stylistic development is evident, with two general phases taking shape: an early period, dominated by song forms such as the ballata, similar in style to the work of Jacopo da Bologna or Francesco Landini; and a period possibly beginning around 1400, when he was in Rome, during which his music is influenced by the ars subtilior. Both sacred and secular vocal music survive by Zacara, and in greater quantity than most other composers from the period around 1400. Numerous paired mass movements, Glorias and Credos, are in a Bologna manuscript (Q15), compiled beginning around 1420; seven songs appear in the Squarcialupi Codex (probably compiled 1410‚Äì1415) and 12 in the Mancini Codex (probably compiled around 1410). Three songs are found in other sources, including the ars subtilior, Latin-texted Sumite, karissimi, capud de Remulo, patres. Apart from one caccia (Cacciando un giorno), a Latin ballade (Sumite, karissimi), and a madrigal (Plorans ploravi), his secular songs are all ballate (Fallows 2001). A recent study proposes attribution to Zacara of a French-texted two-voice composition, Le temps verr√†, found in the manuscript T.III.2, in part on stylistic grounds, and in part on the basis of the politically charged, satirical subject matter of the text.Di Mascia and Marchi 2001. The songs in the Squarcialupi Codex and Mancini Codex differ greatly in style. Those in the former document were probably written early in Zacara's career, and show influence from lyrical mid-century Italian composers such as Landini; the music in the Mancini Codex is more closely related to the mannerist style of the ars subtilior. While exact dates on the music have not been established, it is possible that some of the music in the Mancini Codex was written after Zacara left Rome, and was more likely to be influenced by the Avignon-based avant-garde ars subtilior style; on the other hand he may have been consciously trying to create a Roman response to the music coming from the court of the schismatic antipopes. One of the strangest of Zacara's songs, occurring in the Mancini Codex, is Deus deorum, Pluto, a two-voice invocation to the Roman god of the underworld; the text is filled with the names of the inhabitants of the infernal regions. It is \\"an enthusiastic prayer to Pluto, king of the demons\\"Ghisi 1946, 185.‚Äînot the kind of composition one would normally expect from a pious Vatican secretary. Zacara even used this song as a basis for one of his settings of the Credo of the mass. Zacara's mass movements appears to have been influential on other composers of the early 15th century, including Johannes Ciconia and Bartolomeo da Bologna; some of his innovations can even be seen in Dufay. Zacara may have been the first to use 'divisi' passages in the upper voices. His movements are much longer than other 14th century mass movements, and use imitation extensively, as well as hocket (a more archaic technique). In general, his paired movements‚ÄîGloria, Credo‚Äîare a link between the scattered, ununified movements of the 14th century (Machaut's Messe de Nostre Dame being the significant exception) and the cyclic mass which developed in the 15th century.Cuthbert 2004, 351. Some of Zacara's pieces are found in very distant sources, indicating his fame and wide distribution, including in a Polish manuscript and in the English Old Hall Manuscript (no. 33, a setting of the Gloria).

SC G√∂ttingen 05 is a German football club based in G√∂ttingen, Lower Saxony. The club is the second to use that name. History The first incarnation of 1898 was disbanded by 1903 and a new club was started up in 1905 as G√∂ttinger FC 05. In 1920 it was renamed to VfR 05 G√∂ttingen and in 1921, to 1. SC G√∂ttingen 05. For the most part, the club lived out its existence as a side known only locally in northern Germany. They played in the Westdeutscher Spielverband between 1921 and 1933, and after the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich, joined the Gauliga Niedersachsen. After World War II, the team was disbanded and re-formed as Schwarz-Gelb G√∂ttingen. They took on the name 1. SC G√∂ttingen 05 again in 1948 and at the same time joined first-class Oberliga Nord. The club spent ten years there, with their best result being a fifth-place finish, before slipping to the Amateurliga Niedersachsen-Ost (III). G√∂ttingen played their way into the Regionalliga Nord (II) in 1964‚Äì65 for a run of thirteen seasons with good results early on including three consecutive second-place finishes. The club failed in three attempts to advance to the Bundesliga through the promotion rounds in 1967, 1968, and 1974. In 1974, G√∂ttingen was one of the founding members of the 2. Bundesliga Nord. By the late-1970s the team slipped to the III tier Amateur- Oberliga Nord, with one last appearance in the 2. Bundesliga in 1980‚Äì81, followed by a temporary fall to IV division play in the mid-1990s. In 1996 and 1999, G√∂ttingen won promotion back into the Regionalliga Nord (III), just to suffer relegation again in 1998 respectively 2000. A solid effort and first- place finish in the Oberliga Niedersachsen/Bremen (IV), followed by a clean run through the promotion round in 2001 was wasted when the club could not get a license due to its shaky financial condition. By September 2003 the club was bankrupt: its Verbandsliga games were cancelled and its operation folded up. A new side dubbed 1. FC G√∂ttingen 05 rose from the ashes and its youth teams returned to the pitch. A merger was arranged with RSV Geismar which needed some help after being relegated and also having their own side fall apart. The combined side has returned to play in 2005‚Äì06 as RSV G√∂ttingen 05. In June 2013, the football section of RSV became an independent club under the name I. SC G√∂ttingen 05, spelled with a Roman numeral as a reference to the logo of the original club, which had also used the spelling of I. SC.Der 1. SC G√∂ttingen 05 schreibt sich als I.

Regarding the album's overall style, Jason Ross explained: :\\"I think there's a basic theme through the whole work. . . Everything that's depicted is a human relationship, but it's all about forgiveness. There is definitely a hint of guilt in many of the songs. Many of our families have gone through divorce, and fidelity is a big issue for this band.\\"Seven Mary Three Biography MusicianGuide.com.

History Inglenook in the 19th century The winery was founded in 1879 by a Finnish Sea Captain Gustave Niebaum. Niebaum's employee Hamden McIntyre was not an architect but he designed gravity flow wineries for Inglenook and Far Niente along with other wineries of the decade. Niebaum died in 1908 and the winery was shut down during Prohibition. Upon repeal of Prohibition, Niebaum's widow, Suzanne Niebaum, reopened Inglenook and brought in a viticulturist and an enologist to upgrade the winemaking system. Niebaum's great-nephew, John Daniel Jr., took over operations in 1939 and, by the 1940s, Inglenook's wines once were again declared by many to be the best in the Valley. More than of the property were acquired by Francis Ford Coppola in 1975 with profits of his film, The Godfather. The brand name and the remaining 94 acres (38 ha), including the historic winery, were bought by Heublein, Inc., which began making lower quality wines produced elsewhere under the Inglenook label. Heublin was later bought by RJR Nabisco, then sold to Grand Metropolitan in 1987. Heublein sold the winery to the Canandaigua Wine Company (which later became Constellation Brands) in 1994. Canandaigua consolidated winemaking operations elsewhere and sold the remaining acreage and winery to Coppola in 1995. In the French tradition, Coppola combined his name with the original owner, naming the facility Niebaum-Coppola Estate Winery. Coppola later renamed it the Rubicon Estate Winery. In January 2008, The Wine Group announced that it would purchase Almaden Vineyards, the Inglenook label, and the Paul Masson Winery in Madera, California from Constellation Brands for $134 million in cash. On April 11, 2011, Francis Ford Coppola acquired the iconic Inglenook trademark, paying more, he said, than he had for the entire estate and announced that the estate would once again be known by its historic name, Inglenook.

This was Diamond Head's first album since Canterbury, released 10 years earlier. It was co- produced, engineered and mixed by Andrew Scarth, who had previously worked for bands such as Bad Company and Foreigner. The album had a much cleaner and more polished sound than their previous three albums and featured two special guests, Tony Iommi, of Black Sabbath, and Dave Mustaine, of Megadeth, the latter also enlisting the help of his own producer Max Norman. Some of the tracks off this album were released on an EP in 1992 entitled Rising Up, although this EP was only sold in specialist music stores. National Bowl Incident The reunion of Diamond Head did not last. One major contributor to the second fall of the band was during the Death and Progress tour, when Diamond Head opened for Metallica and Megadeth at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes on 5 June 1993, The Almighty was also on the bill. During the show Sean Harris came out dressed as the Grim Reaper, which Brian Tatler reported in the British rock magazine Classic Rock, was Harris' way of saying that NWOBHM was over. They opened with their flagship song, \\"Am I Evil\\" and ended with \\"Helpless\\"; both off their debut Lightning to the Nations, as they thought this would go down well with the Metallica fan base. However, as Diamond Head had not been around for the majority of the previous decade and Metallica had covered both of these songs (\\"Am I Evil\\" was the B-side to \\"Creeping Death\\" and \\"Helpless\\" appeared on The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited), much of the crowd thought that Diamond Head were covering Metallica songs. On top of this, their performance was very under par, which was due to the pressure of playing live on MTV, the fact Tatler was suffering from shingles at the time and Diamond Head had had very little rehearsal time prior to the gig. The band split up again and would not reform again until 2000.

The country's principal intelligence agency, CISEN, is directly answerable to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary is a member of the President's Cabinet and is, given the constitutional implications of the post, the most important Cabinet Member. Additionally, in case of absolute absence of the President, the Secretary of Interior assumes the executive powers of the President provisionally. The Office is practically equivalent to Ministries of the Interior in most other countries (with the exception of the United States of America) and is occasionally translated to English as Ministry, Secretariat or Department of the Interior.  History  In 1821, after the establishment of what was then the Mexican Provisional Cabinet (Junta Gubernativa Provisional), and given public urgings to organise the country's government, regulation was produced outlining the functions of a new governmental arm, then styled The Office for Domestic and Foreign Affairs. The new agency was answerable for managing the functioning of the government in general. The first person to take up the Directorship of the Office was Jos√© Manuel de Herrera who held the post between 1821 and 1823. Later on, it became necessary to particularise the duties of certain government agencies, which, in 1843, lead to the creation of the 'Office for Home Affairs' (also styled 'Department of the Interior'), which would later be re-styled as the 'Office for Foreign Relations and Government' in 1841 and then again in 1843 as the 'Office for Home Affairs and Policing'. The Office eventually had some of its powers separated into other ministries and, in 1853, was once again named 'Office for Home Affairs' ‚Äîas it is still called up to the present day. The Office for Home Affairs in its modern day form, is concerned principally with the good management and proper application of the policies of Mexico's Federal Government within its national borders. It is a department of the national executive branch, whose origins date back to article 222 of the 1812 Spanish Constitution, which received royal assent on 19 March, 1812. Among the Cabinet Secretaries mentioned in the constitution, were those of Governance of the Realm in the Peninsula and Adjacent Islands and Governance of the Realm Overseas. On 22 October, 1814, the Constitutional Declaration for the Emancipation of the Mexican Americas known as the Apatzing√°n Constitution made provisions for a republican form of Government by way of Article 134. The Apatzing√°n Constitution provided for an Executive Branch known as the Supreme Government which would be equipped with an Department for Home Affairs, among other governmental departments. Political significance This position was historically seen as being a heartbeat away from the Presidency, because several Secretaries of the Interior were chosen as presidential candidates for the following term by incumbent presidents Plutarco El√≠as Calles, Emilio Portes Gil, L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s, Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz, Luis Echeverr√≠a. Francisco Labastida Ochoa, Secretary of the Interior during the latter part of the Zedillo government, was seen as Zedillo's personal favorite during the Institutional Revolutionary Party's primaries (the first the party would ever hold) and during his unsuccessful bid which saw his political undoing at the hands of PAN candidate Vicente Fox.

He holds the Guinness World Records for \\"lowest note produced by a human\\" and the \\"widest vocal range\\".  Musical career  Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Storms was raised in Waterloo, Indiana. His musical affinity appeared at a young age. Four days after graduating high school, he returned to Oklahoma to begin his career in Christian music. Since then, Storms has appeared with a number of singing groups, including Freedom, Vocal Union, AVB, Acappella, and Rescue. He also performed with the cast of Branson‚Äôs \\"50s at the Hop,\\" was voted Branson‚Äôs Bass Singer of the Year for three years in a row, and is in the Branson‚Äôs Entertainers Hall of Fame. Storms joined Pierce Arrow Theater in Branson at the beginning of the 2006 season. As well as his performances across the US, Storms has also performed in Brazil, France, Switzerland, Jamaica, and Fiji. In 2012, after auditioning to record with the St. Petersburg Chamber Choir in St. Petersburg, Russia, Storms was selected by composer Paul Mealor, producer Anna Barry and Decca Records to record four songs with the choir. Two of the four songs, \\"De Profundis\\" and \\"The Twelve Brigands,\\" ended up on the Universal/Decca Records release, Tranquility Voices of Deep Calm.  Guinness World Record  Storms' Guinness World Record for the lowest note produced by a human was first certified in January 2002. Storms also holds the Guinness World Record for the widest vocal range for a male. His records have been published in the Guinness World Records 2006. He broke both of these records in August 2008. As of 2008, the new record for lowest note was 0.7973 Hz, and the new record for Widest Vocal Range For Any Human was ten octaves. In 2012, Storms reclaimed the record for the Lowest Note Produced by a Human. The new record is G‚àí7, or 0.189 Hz, eight octaves below the lowest G on the piano, or just over seven octaves below the piano. The most recent published record is in the 2020 Guinness Book of World Records. Storms' record-setting sounds are so low as to be infrasonic, incapable of being perceived by the human ear. The 2012 record requires more than five seconds for the vocal cords to oscillate once. ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" }{\\\\clef bass g,,,,,,,,,,}(above)G‚àí7  Singing voice  Storms is a bass (basso profondo).

They bill themselves as a \\"Japanese Action Comic Punk band hailing from the Z area of Planet Peelander\\". While the founding members of Peelander-Z were all born in Japan, they first met and formed their band while living in Buffalo, NY.J-Pop World interview They perform on stage and appear in color-coordinated costumes, which they state are not costumes, but their skin. The costumes range from sentai style suits, to kimono, to rubber Playmobil style wigs. There is also a tiger costume and a giant squid/guitar costume to coincide with the song \\"Mad Tiger\\". Another aspect of their routine is their on-stage antics such as human bowling (diving head-first into bowling pins), pretending to hit each other with chairs in imitation of pro-wrestlers, and mid-performance piggyback rides. They often allow audience members on stage to join in on the fun, and often dive into the audience or hang from a balcony as part of their act. In 1999 the band released a mini album on Eat Rice Records. The band was also featured on an episode of the Upright Citizens Brigade on Comedy Central. In 2001 Peelander-Z released their first full-length album, Rocket Gold Star on Eat Rice Records. Band remained active this year touring both Canada and Japan. In June 2008, Peelander Blue announced he would be leaving the group to \\"go back to the Peelander-planet\\" because he is \\"a prince of P-Planet\\" and the \\"P-King will be retiring.\\" (P-Blue was getting married and could no longer tour.) In July 2008, Peelander-Z welcomed Peelander-Green. On September 17, 2012 Peelander-Red announced he would be leaving the band at the end of their U.S. tour. He left the band to open up his own bar in New York. Peelander- Purple joined the band as his replacement in February 2013. In late 2013, Peelander Green left the band and has since been replaced by several temporary members, including Becoming the Archetype drummer Chris Heaton.Official Peelander-Z Facebook He was later replaced by Ryo Tanaka, formerly of the Japanese band Spica. Videos surfacing from 2015 live concerts show Peelander-Z performing as only a three-piece band with Yellow on Guitar, Green on drums and Pink on bass. In 2016, Film Movement released Mad Tiger, the feature documentary film about the band's inner turmoil during and after Peelander- Red's departure. The film was in production from 2012 to 2015 and was directed by Jonathan Yi and Michael Haertlein. Peelander-Z released an album titled Go PZ Go on April 6, 2018.

The signs often contain the lyrics to their songs. At some of their shows they also bring people from outside of the band on stage to play their instruments as they do a stage act. Wrestling Professional wrestling is a big theme in Peelander-Z's personas. Peelander Blue dresses in pro-wrestling garb, including a replica wrestling belt. All 3 members of the group are fans of professional wrestling, and are friends with independent wrestlers \\"M-Dogg 20\\" Matt Cross and Josh Prohibition. They have also been musically featured with pro-wrestling related Kaiju Big Battel. On June 23, 2007, the group performed at The Florida Supercon in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. During their concert, pro-wrestler Nick Mayberry rushed the stage and threatened to assault the group. The trio were able to fight back, and both Peelander Blue and Peelander Red pinned Mayberry simultaneously - being named new co-HCW Hardcore Champions. This was their first pro-wrestling Title win. On November 3, 2007, Mayberry appeared again with the group at the JaniCon in Jacksonville, Florida. He again made his way to the stage during their concert, assaulting the band and re-gaining HCW's Hardcore Championship, before being taken down by a chairshot from Peelander Blue. Peelander Blue, Peelander Red and Peelander Pink pinned Mayberry simultaneously, with all 3 being named co-HCW Hardcore Champions. It marks their second pro-wrestling Title victory.

These range from basic part-time systems that require the driver to move a control lever to send power to four wheels, to permanent four-wheel systems that monitor and sense traction needs at all four wheels automatically under all conditions. Command-Trac=Command-Trac Command-Trac was first introduced using the NP208 transfer case in the full-size Jeeps (SJ series) in 1980. The drive modes are the same as with the Dana 18 and 20 transfer cases: 2Hi, 4HI PT, and 4LO PT. The 4WD modes are not for use on high-traction surfaces such as dry roads. The NP208 was used through at least 1987. More commonly, Command-Trac is used to refer to the NP/NV-231 or NP-207 transfer cases introduced along with the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) in 1984. The system offers a chain-driven, aluminum, \\"shift-on-the-fly\\" transfer case. The \\"shift-on-the-fly\\" feature provides manual ease and assist while engaging 4WD. Command-Trac should only be driven in 4WD on low-traction surfaces due to the front and rear axles being locked together (no differential action in the transfer case). Driving in 4WD on dry pavement causes excessive tire and drivetrain wear. Four-wheel modes are most commonly used for wet/slick surfaces or extreme weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.) (4H), towing (N), and off-road activities (4L). There are reports of a modified version known as NP-231J HD which was supposedly (SP) a \\"heavy duty\\" version for the Jeep Grand Cherokee with V8 engines. The NP/NV-231 case is a chain-driven unit that takes 21- or 23-spline input shafts. The 23-spline was for the AX-15 transmission, and the 21-spline was used for the AX-5 and BA 10/5 transmissions. Low range for this case was 2.72 and high range was 1.00. The Command-Trac HD transfer case was used in 6-speed Liberty KJ's from 2005 to 2007. Although sometimes referred to as the \\"NV(NP)231HD,\\" the transfer cases are actually the 241 series used in full- sized trucks from other makers (241D or 241C). The Jeep version is labelled \\"NV(NP)241J.\\" This is not the NV241OR transfer case found in the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, which uses a 4.0 low range and has a reinforced case. Dodge uses a 241DHD, which has a reinforced case but the 2.72 low-range. The Jeep Grand Cherokee/Commander line no longer offers a part-time transfer case option. The reason behind this was its poor sales along with an improved Selec-Trac. Selec-Trac and a simplistic Quadra-Trac had the convenience and comfort of \\"Full-Time\\" all wheel drive that Command-Trac lacked for \\"luxury\\" SUV's that did not require the more rugged part-time system. The terms \\"Command-Trac\\" and \\"Selec-Trac\\" were used in other Jeep lines and refer to different transfer cases in those lines.

These are very similar to the Quadra-Trac NP219 transfer case described in the next section below. The differences are 1) they added a 2WD mode for fuel savings and 2) the 2WD- to-4WD modes were controlled via a vacuum switch on the dashboard. The Hi-N-Lo range selection was still performed using a shift lever on the console. The NP228 differs from the NP229 by not having the viscous coupling in 4WD Hi mode, reverting to a simpler open center differential. Both transfer cases still lock the center differential in 4WD Lo mode. The NP228/229 transfer cases were available in the full-size Jeeps from 1983 to 1991. The NP228 was also available in the XJ Cherokee and Wagoneers and the MJ Comanche pickups from 1984 until replaced by the NP242 in 1987. Several companies have offered a dual shift lever conversion which replaces the vacuum switch and solenoid with a more reliable second console lever for 2WD-4WD mode selection. The AMC Eagle used the NP119 transfer case in 1980, a strictly full-time all wheel drive model. From 1981 to 1988, a similar system was employed, dubbed \\"Select- Drive\\", which allowed the vehicle to switch from all wheel drive to 2WD using the NP129 model transfer case. The NP129 contained a viscous coupling around an open differential for added traction in slippery conditions. The NP128 has also been found equipped in select model years, which does not feature a viscous coupling. The NP242 Selec-Trac transfer case debuted alongside the Fuel-Injected 4.0L Inline-6 in the compact Jeep Cherokee in 1987. The shifter has modes 2WD - 4WD Hi Part-Time - 4WD Hi Full-Time - N - 4WD Low. There is a center differential that is open in 4WD Hi Full-Time mode and distributes torque 48/52% front-to-rear. This mode can be used on dry pavement or slippery surfaces with only a small fuel mileage penalty compared to 2WD mode. In 4WD Hi Part-Time and 4WD Low, the center differential is mechanically locked, so these modes are for slippery surfaces only.http://media.fcanorthamerica.com/pdf.do?id=1506 Low range engages a 2.72:1 planetary gear ratio for increased torque and low speeds. Overall, this system functions very much like the NP228 transfer case above, just with all of the mode and range controls via a single, console-mounted shift lever. It was available in the 1987 to 2001 XJ Cherokee and Wagoneer, the 1987 to 1992 MJ Comanche, the 1993 to 2004 ZJ and WJ Grand Cherokees, the 2002 to 2007 KJ Liberty, and the 1998 to 2000 Dodge Durango. It was replaced in the 2005 Grand Cherokee by the Quadra-Trac II system featuring the NV245 transfer case with 4WD Auto mode and in the 2008 KK Liberty by Selec-Trac II using the MP3022 transfer case. Applications: * 1983‚Äì1991 Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer and Jeep full-size pickups (SJ) * 1984‚Äì2001 Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer (XJ) * 1986‚Äì1992 Jeep Comanche (MJ) *note, 1986 models were available with Selec-Trac utilizing only the NP228/NP229 * 1993‚Äì2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ, WJ) * 1998‚Äì2000 Dodge Durango * 2002‚Äì2007 Jeep Liberty/Cherokee (KJ) Selec-Trac II Selec-Trac II uses a console mounted switch to control the MP3022 transfer case. The switch controls the 4WD mode with options of 2WD - 4WD Auto - N - 4WD Low. The MP3022 transfer case uses an electronically controlled clutch pack to bias torque from 100% rear to 50/50% front/rear. The transfer case has no center differential, so power can only be supplied to the front axle when the rear wheels begin to slip. In this way, the transfer case works almost identically to the NV247 transfer case used in the Quadra-Trac II system in 1999 to 2004 WJ Jeep Grand Cherokees. In 4WD Low mode, the clutch pack is locked and power flows through a 2.72:1 planetary gear set for higher torque at lower speeds. The 2018 and newer JL Wrangler comes by default with Command- Trac, but its Sahara trim can be upgraded to Selec-Trac II, marketed as simply Selec-Trac, utilizing the MP3022 transfer case.

The first version used the Borg-Warner BW1339 transfer case and was produced from 1973 to 1979. The next version used the New Process NP219 transfer case and was produced from 1980 to 1982. From 1993 to 1995 the New Process NP249 transfer case carried the name. And from 1996 to 1998 the transfer case was manufactured by New Venture Gear with some minor improvements and it was renamed the NV249. Quadra-Trac was the trade name for the Borg-Warner 1305 and 1339 gear cases. It was a chain-drive system introduced in 1973 on the full-sized Jeep line behind the AMC version of the Turbo-Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. CJ7s also received the Quadra- Trac starting in 1976. The BW1305 included 1) a differential with a cone-type slip-limiting clutch to distribute torque between the front and rear output shafts and 2) a vacuum-switch-operated differential lock. It offered only 4WD Hi modes in full-time (open) or part-time (locked) modes. The BW1339 added a 2.57:1 low range gearset to the BW1305, enabling 5 modes: 4WD Hi Locked, 4WD Hi Open, Neutral, 4WD Low Open, and 4WD Low Locked. The Jeep Quadra-Trac was differentiated from the open \\"New Process\\" Gear NP203 used by Dodge, General Motors, and Ford in that it included a center limited slip differential feature, in this case a clutch pack. Applications: * 1973-1979 Jeep Wagoneer (SJ) * 1973-1979 Jeep Cherokee (SJ) * 1973-1979 Jeep Gladiator * 1976-1979 Jeep CJ-7 The Borg-Warner system was replaced with a \\"New Process Gear\\" NP219-based system in 1980John, Full-size Jeep pages on wagoneers.com 25 February 2002 . Retrieved on 9 October 2010. The NP219 Quadra-Trac transfer case was available in full-size Jeep Cherokee, Wagoneer, and Grand Wagoneer from 1980 through 1982. It offered the following modes: 4H LK, 4H, N, and 4L. In 4H (full-time 4WD High) a center differential with a viscous limited-slip coupling is used between the front and rear output shafts. A 2.61:1 low range was engaged in 4WD Lo mode. And in both '4H LK' (4WD Hi Locked) and '4L' modes the center differential is mechanically locked. The 'N' mode disengages the transfer case, transmission, and engine from the axles, thus enabling flat- towing the Jeep behind another vehicle. In 1983, the NP219-based Quadra-Trac system was replaced by the NP228/229-based Selec-Trac, adding a fuel-saving 2WD mode to the full- and part-time 4WD modes of Quadra-Trac. Applications: * 1980-1982 Jeep Wagoneer and full-size pickups (SJ) In 1993 Jeep re-introduced Quadra-Trac, this time on the Jeep Grand Cherokee using the NP249 transfer case. Like the NP219, this transfer case utilizes a center differential with a viscous coupler to provide smooth and efficient four-wheel drive operation on all surfaces. This system has 4WD All-Time, Neutral, and 4WD Low modes. In normal 4WD All-time mode, the center differential is open and distributes torque to both the front and rear axles. When a difference in speed occurs between the axles, heat buildup causes the viscous fluid inside the coupler to thicken, which progressively locks the center differential thus transferring power to the axle with more traction. In 4WD Low, the input torque is multiplied through a 2.72:1 planetary gearset. NP249 transfer cases used the viscous coupler to transfer power in both high and low ranges. Applications: * 1993-1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ) In 1996 the NP249 was replaced with the New Venture Gear NV249 transfer case. This added a mechanical differential lock to 4WD Low mode, making it much more durable for serious off-road use. The NV249-based Quadra-Trac system was replaced by the NV247-based Quadra-Trac II system for the 1999 to 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ). Applications: * 1996-1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ) Quadra-Trac II Quadra-Trac II was introduced in 1999 and it employs a two-speed chain-driven transfer case featuring three modes of operation, \\"4-All Time\\", \\"N\\" or neutral, and \\"4-Lo\\". Two different transfer cases were used, the NV247 in 1999-2004 WJs and the NV245 in 2005-2010 WKs and 2006-2009 XKs. For the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees using the NV247 transfer case, in \\"4-All Time\\" mode torque is applied to only the rear wheels under normal driving conditions. A gerotor pump is connected between the front and rear output shafts and senses any speed difference between them. When the shafts are turning at different speeds (wheel slippage), the pump supplies oil under pressure to a wet clutch pack. The clutch pack applies progressive 0 to 100% locking between the front and rear output shafts. For example, if the rear axle starts rotating at a significantly higher rate than the front axle, the gerotor pump causes the clutch pack to progressively lock, transferring torque to the front axle until both axles are driven at the same speed. The apply pressure in the clutch pack bleeds off slowly, which progressively unlocks the clutch pack and biases torque output towards \\"rear only\\" unless the rear wheels are still slipping. There is no center differential, so on dry pavement the front and rear output shafts cannot be locked without causing driveline binding. The \\"N\\" or neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In \\"4-Lo\\" mode, the input shaft drives through a 2.72:1 reduction planetary gear set and the front and rear axles are locked together through the clutch pack. This same NV247 transfer case is the foundation for the Quadra-Drive system described below. In 2005 Jeep replaced the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case with the NV245 transfer case. This transfer case actually has a center differential, allowing both the front and rear axles to have power supplied to them without driveline binding, even on dry pavement. The torque distribution under normal driving conditions (no tire slippage) is 48% front and 52% rear. There is also an electronically controlled variable lockup clutch pack that can apply progressive 0 to 100% locking across the center differential. This is the improvement over the Selec-Trac NV242 transfer case, as that system has only fully unlocked and fully locked settings and requires manual shifting between them. And finally, the NV245 has the 'N' and '4WD Low' modes which act in the same manner as in the NV247 transfer case above. The major difference between the NV245-based Quadra-Trac II and Quadra-Drive II is that Quadra-Trac II uses the Brake Traction Control System (BTCS) instead of electronically controlled differentials. When it senses a left-to-right speed differences between wheel hubs BTCS can apply each of the vehicle's brakes independently, similar to anti-lock brakes, enabling Quadra-Trac II's open front and rear differentials to offer limited-slip capabilities. Applications: * 1999‚ÄìPresent Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ,WK,WK2) * 2006-2009 Jeep Commander (XK) Quadra-Trac I Quadra-Trac I was introduced in 2004 and works similarly to the Quadra-Trac II system, but eliminates the \\"4 Lo\\" and \\"N\\" or neutral modes. By excluding these modes it creates a system that requires no driver input. In 2005 Jeep added the brake traction control system and replaced the New Venture Gear NV147 transfer caseWJ Four-Wheel Drive Systems, WJ Jeeps.com. Retrieved on 9 October 2010. with the NV140 transfer case. Applications: * 2004‚Äìpresent Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ,WK,WK2) * 2006-2009 Jeep Commander (XK) Quadra-Drive Quadra- Drive selector in a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ) The Quadra-Drive system was introduced in 1999 and is based on the Quadra-Trac II system but adds limited slip differentials to the front and rear axles to create a four-wheel drive system capable of not only directing torque to the axle with best traction but to the individual wheel on an axle with best traction. Quadra-Drive Quadra-Drive uses the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep's Vari-Lok which are gerotor style limited slip differentials. Applications: * 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ) Quadra- Drive II Quadra-Drive II uses the New Venture Gear NV245 transfer case mated to front and rear axles containing electronic limited slip differentials or ELSDs. Jeep added traction control in 2005 and starting in 2011 only a rear ELSD is offered, while the front has an open differential. Applications: * 2005‚ÄìPresent Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK,WK2) * 2006-2010 Jeep Commander (XK) Freedom Drive Freedom Drive is Jeep's four wheel drive system used in its compact crossover SUVs based on a front wheel drive platform, the Compass and Patriot. There are two versions of the basic Freedom Drive system for the US Market, called I and II. Freedom Drive I Freedom Drive I is a light duty full-time electronically controlled all wheel drive system with a locking mode to set the front/rear torque split for especially slippery conditions in the Jeeps derived from the Chrysler/Mitsubishi GS Platform. Applications: * 2007‚Äì2017 Jeep Compass (MK) * 2007‚Äì2017 Jeep Patriot (MK) Freedom Drive II Freedom Drive II uses the same hardware as the FDI system but adds a lower axle gear ratio in conjunction with the CVT to simulate the benefits of a low-range transfer case, giving a 19:1 overall gear ratio for off-road use. This function is an alternate program in the CVT and is not a transfer case function. FDII also adds a hill descent control system, off-road tuned traction control, and electronic stability program. The Patriot with FDII also features longer suspension travel (all 4x4, post 2011 models have the same suspension), skid plates, tow hooks, and a full-size spare tire. This enables the FDII-equipped Patriot to wear the \\"Trail Rated\\" badge from Jeep. Trail Rated Jeep vehicles are determined by meeting several requirements of off-road conditions including water fording, articulation, and other tests. Applications: * 2007‚Äì2017 Jeep Patriot (MK) * 2011‚Äì2017 Jeep Compass (MK) For the European Market there is a single version which combines elements of both U.S. versions. The European version is available with either a CVT gearbox or most commonly with a 6-speed manual gearbox and has two settings on the traction control and electronic stability program systems to cater for off- road activity, U.S. FDII suspension travel and a full-size spare tire. Skid plates and tow hooks are options in the EU, but the hill descent control system is not available. Applications: * 2007‚Äìpresent Jeep Compass (MK) * 2007‚Äìpresent Jeep Patriot (MK) Active Drive=Active Drive I Active Drive I is a full-time four-wheel drive system that requires no driver input. This system under normal conditions sends all available torque to the front wheels while monitoring the speed of the front and rear axles. If the system detects that the front axle is moving more quickly than the rear axle then the system will send power through the power transfer unit to the rear axle until the speeds are the same. Applications: * 2014‚Äìpresent Jeep Cherokee (KL) * 2015‚Äìpresent Jeep Renegade (BU) * 2016‚Äìpresent Jeep Compass (MP) *2018‚Äìpresent Jeep Grand Commander Active Drive II Active Drive II includes all of the features of Active Drive I but adds a low gear range. When in \\"4-Low\\" mode the front and rear axles are locked together and power is sent to all four-wheels through a 2.92:1 gear reduction in the power transfer unit; providing a crawl ratio of 56:1 for four cylinder Jeep Cherokees and a 47.8:1 crawl ratio for six-cylinder Cherokees. All Cherokees with this system have a raised ride height of one inch. Applications: * 2014‚Äìpresent Jeep Cherokee (KL) Active Drive Low Active Drive Low includes all of the features of Active Drive I but denotes a greater possible crawl ratio. When in \\"4-Low\\" mode the front and rear axles are locked together and power is sent to all four-wheels through the power transfer unit although no low range gear reduction occurs. Active Drive low relies on shorter axle gear ratios while holding first gear in the ZF9HP transmission to achieve a crawl ratio of 20:1; similar in effect to Freedom Drive II. Applications: * 2015‚Äìpresent Jeep Renegade (BU) * 2018‚Äìpresent Jeep Compass (MP) Active Drive Lock Active Drive Lock includes all the features of Active Drive II but adds \\"rock\\" mode to the Selec-terrain system and locking rear differential for better traction when used off-road.

He was a key founder of the Scottish Mountaineering Club and created the eponymous Naismith's rule, used to determine to the time necessary to walk a route with a given length and elevation gain.  Early life  Naismith was the second of two children born to William Naismith, a physician, and Mary Anne Murray. He was raised in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire and attended Gilbertfield House School. He was introduced to mountain climbing in the Scottish Highlands at an early age by his parents; he had climbed Ben Lomond by the age of nine and made a winter ascent of Beinn Bhreac by fourteen. After school, he completed a degree in accounting at the University of Glasgow.  Climbing career  Naismith began climbing seriously in the 1880s. His difficult ascent of Ben More in 1884 led him to the belief that Scotland's mountains demanded the same level of respect as those in the Alps, and in January 1889 he had a letter published in the Glasgow Herald proposing the formation of a \\"Scottish Alpine Club\\". After receiving numerous responses, he and others founded the Scottish Mountaineering Club in March 1889. Naismith, regarded as \\"the father of the club\\", was its first treasurer. Naismith made several first ascents throughout his career. In 1894 he was the first to climb (and name) Tower Ridge on the UK's highest mountain, Ben Nevis; in 1896 he made the first winter ascent of the mountain's North-East Buttress; and in 1898 he ascended its Staircase Climb for the first time. He became the first to climb Crowberry Ridge of Buachaille Etive M√≤r in 1896 by a route now known as Naismith's Route. He was also a proficient skier, and made the first recorded expedition on skis in Scottish history when he skied through the Campsie Fells in 1890. In 1895 he became the first person to explore a frozen- over Loch Lomond on ice skates. He is perhaps best known for conceiving Naismith's rule, a method for estimating the amount of time it will take to walk a route according to its distance and elevation gain. According to the rule, a fit individual can walk roughly in an hour, with an additional hour for every of altitude gained.  Later life  Naismith lived in Glasgow from 1905 onwards and attended the Kelvinside Hillhead Parish Church, Glasgow where he was an elder for 27 years. He married Edith A.W. Barron in 1925 when he was 69 years old. He died on 27 September 1935 after falling ill suddenly, and was buried in his hometown of Hamilton.

It is the single high school for the Horseheads Central School District. The communities of the Town and Village of Horseheads, Big Flats, Elmira, Veteran, Breesport, Pine Valley, Erin, Millport, Lowman, Beaver Dams, Cayuta, Catlin, and portions of adjacent communities make up the district. Elective, Regents, classes with Corning Community College), and several AP courses are offered by the school. Students also have the option of attending vocational programs through The Greater Southern Tier Board of Cooperative Educational Services (GST BOCES). Demographics The school is accredited with the New York State Board of Regents. Enrollment in the 2009‚Äì10 school year was 1,379. The district has an approximate population of 25,000, and covers some . The school was also home to the 2009 New York State teacher of the year, Vickie Mike, who was a Spanish teacher at the school. Campus The red-brick, two-story complex was built in the 1950s with additions built in the 1960s. It consists of two wings (north and south) connected by a link. The science, mathematics, and music departments along with the cafeteria, pool, library, main and guidance offices, auditorium, and a gym are located in the north wing. The humanities departments, along with another gym, are located in the south wing. Architecturally, the building is without a main facade and a central location, and going from one wing to another (a path that would roughly follow the perimeter of the central parking lot), is not a direct route. Formerly students were able to cross this central parking lot to get to class, but this policy has been discontinued due to safety concerns. The high school contains two gyms, each with a regulation sized basketball court, and room for approximately 500 people. The high school also contains a weight room with an extensive collection of aerobic, cardiovascular and free weight equipment. A regulation 25-yard pool also is within Horseheads High School. It is used by a variety of groups, and is open to the general public at a variety of dates and times. Adjacent to the high school, are the outdoor athletic facilities. Directly behind the school, bordered by Interstate 86 and Norfolk Southern Railway, is the main complex for soccer and lacrosse, and can accommodate up to three fields and a large area for practices. The football and baseball complex, are bordered by a bus garage access road, and youth baseball fields. Basketball games are held in the Horseheads Middle School gym because it's much larger. The Middle School also houses a fieldhouse with a large center area for volleyball, soccer, basketball, etc., a small indoor track, and an indoor/outdoor golf chipping and putting area designed by Joe Sindelar (father of PGA golfer Joey Sindelar) and funded by a grant from the First Tee Program and the LPGA. Academics Horseheads High School is one of the best public schools in Upstate New York, with students going on to attend top universities, including Princeton University, Duke University, University of Pennsylvania, Syracuse University, Cornell University, University of Notre Dame, Amherst College, United States Naval Academy, George Mason University, The Ohio State University, and more. Since 2007, the school has had students matriculate at five of the top ten national universities, according to 2013 U.S. News and World Report magazine figures (Harvard University, Princeton University, Columbia University, Duke University, and University of Pennsylvania). The school was also ranked on the College Board's AP Course honor roll, awarded to only 425 schools in North America, and 25 in New York State. The Horseheads Central School District altogether has been named one of the best 100 school districts in the United States for music education.

His primary pitches are a low-90s fastball and a low-80s curveball with a large break.Scouting report Baseball career Brooks played high school baseball at Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn. In a 1996 game, he threw a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts and hit a home run. After graduation, he attended Saint Peter's College, New Jersey for three years. At the end of his junior season, the Philadelphia Phillies selected him with the 396th overall pick of the 1999 June draft, as part of that draft's thirteenth round. He signed with the Phillies and began his professional career with the Batavia Muckdogs, where he was honored as a member of the New York‚ÄìPenn League's All-Star team. Brooks began his professional career as a starting pitcher, but he converted to relief partway through the season. He was dominant in Double-A in , striking out 71 batters in 58 innings, while surrendering only 40 hits and five home runs. Brooks's performance caught the eye of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who acquired him in a deadline deal for closer Mike Williams. After the trade, Brooks spent time with two of the Pirates' affiliates, the Altoona Curve and the Nashville Sounds. The New York Mets selected Brooks in the Rule 5 draft that off-season, and then immediately traded him to the Oakland Athletics. Brooks was one of five players chosen from the Pirates in the major league portion of that Rule 5 draft, a series of events that resulted in a great deal of criticism of Pirates' general manager, Dave Littlefield. Brooks failed to stick with the Athletics, but when placed on waivers on March 18, was claimed by the Boston Red Sox. Boston likewise had trouble finding space for him on their roster, and when placed on waivers again on March 31, cleared them and was sent back to the Pirates. After spending most of at Triple-A, Brooks made his major league debut on August 27, 2004, and went on to appear in eleven games with the Pirates. He pitched well in relief, striking out 17 batters in 16 innings and surrendering only a .175 batting average to opposing hitters, but his final season totals were distorted by a poor performance in an emergency start. The Pirates placed him on waivers to clear roster space at the end of the season, and he was claimed by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Brooks went through spring training with the Dodgers, but was placed on waivers yet again on April 13, 2005, and was claimed by the Atlanta Braves. Brooks spent the majority of the 2005 season with the Braves' Triple-A affiliate, the Richmond Braves. He did earn a brief callup to Atlanta, pitching to two batters in a game against the San Diego Padres on May 16. At the end of the year, Brooks signed with the New York Yankees as a minor league free agent. In April , Brooks signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He was released on June 12 and five days later signed with the Boston Red Sox. Brooks spent the rest of 2006 pitching for the Red Sox Double-A affiliate, the Portland Sea Dogs. On November 8, 2006, Brooks signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres and became a free agent after the season. On April 14, , Brooks signed with the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League.

All these names derive from the name of the Czechs, the West Slavic ethnic group native to the Czech lands. Czechia (), the official English short name specified by the Czech government, is used by many international organisations and attested as early as 1841. However, most English speakers use [the] Czech Republic in all contexts. Other languages generally have greater official use of a short form analogous to ƒåesko or Czechia (such as French , or Korean /Ches≈≠kko or /Chekho) although forms equivalent to \\"Czech Republic\\" are not uncommon. The Czech name is from the same root but means Bohemia, the westernmost and largest historical region of the Czech lands and the modern Czech Republic. The name Bohemia is an exonym derived from the Boii, a Celtic tribe inhabiting the area before the early Slavs arrived. The Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1348‚Äì1918) were part of the Holy Roman Empire; often called \\"the Czech lands\\", they sometimes extended further, to all of Silesia, Lusatia, and various smaller territories. The Czech adjective means both \\"Czech\\" and \\"Bohemian\\". The Czech Republic's official formal and short names in Czech were decided at its creation after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in the so- called \\"Velvet Divorce\\" of 1993.  Czech-language name  The country is named after the Czechs (), a Slavic tribe residing in central Bohemia that subdued the surrounding tribes in the late 9th century and created the Czech/Bohemian state. The origin of the name of the tribe itself is unknown. According to legend, it comes from their leader ƒåech, who brought them to Bohemia. Research regards ƒåech as a derivative of the root ƒçel- (member of the people, kinsman). Several variants of the name have been used over the centuries, due to the evolution of the Czech language. The digraph \\"c≈æ\\" was used from the time of the 16th-century Bible of Kralice until the reform of 1842, being eventually replaced by \\"ƒç\\" (changing C≈æechy to ƒåechy). In the late 19th century the suffix for the names of countries changed from -y to -sko (e.g. Rakousy-Rakousko for Austria, Uhry-Uhersko for Hungary). While the notion of ƒåesko appears for the first time in 1704, it only came into official use in 1918 as the first part of the name of the newly independent Czechoslovakia (ƒåesko-Slovensko or ƒåeskoslovensko) . Within that state, the Czech Socialist Republic (ƒåesk√° socialistick√° republika, ƒåSR) was created on 1 January 1969. On 6 March 1990 the Czech Socialist Republic was renamed the Czech Republic (ƒåesk√° republika, ƒåR). When Czechoslovakia broke up in 1993, the Czech part of the name was intended to serve as the name of the Czech state. The decision started a dispute as many perceived the \\"new\\" word ƒåesko, which before had been only rarely used alone, as harsh sounding or as a remnant of ƒåeskoslovensko. The older term ƒåechy was rejected by many because it was primarily associated with Bohemia proper and to use it for the whole country was seen as inappropriate. This feeling was especially prominent among the inhabitants of Moravia. The use of the word \\"ƒåesko\\" within the country itself has increased in recent years. During the 1990s, \\"ƒåesko\\" was rarely used and viewed as controversial. Some Czech politicians and public figures (e.g. media magnate Vladim√≠r ≈Ωelezn√Ω) expressed concern about the non-use of ƒåesko and Czechia. V√°clav Havel claimed that \\"Slugs crawl on me a little whenever I read or hear the word [ƒåesko].\\" Miroslav Zikmund associated it with Hitler's Nuremberg rallies. Minister Alexandr Vondra also strongly opposed using these forms. In 1997, the Civic Initiative Czechia was formed by linguists and geographers in Brno to promote the use of Czechia. The following year, a conference of professionals aimed at encouraging the use of the name was held at Charles University in Prague. The Czech Senate held a session on the issue in 2004.  English-language name  The historical English name of the country is Bohemia. This name derives from the Celtic tribe of Boii, who inhabited the area from the 4th century BC. Boiohaemum, as it was originally known in Latin, comes from the Germanic \\"Boi-haima\\", meaning \\"home of the Boii\\". The name survived all the later migrations affecting the area, including the arrival of the Slavs and the creation of the Czech state. In the 9th century, the country became officially known as the Duchy of Bohemia, changing to the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 11th century, and the Crown of Bohemia in the 14th century. A number of other names for the country have been used, including Lands of the Bohemian Crown, Czech/Bohemian lands, Bohemian Crown, the lands of the Crown of Saint Wenceslas and others. The Bohemian state included the three historical lands: Bohemia (ƒåechy) in narrower meaning, Moravia (Morava) and Silesia (Slezsko). From the 14th century until 1635 it also included Upper and Lower Lusatia. The higher hierarchical status of the Bohemian region led to that name being used for the larger country, with the people and language of this country being commonly referred to as Bohemian. The first known usage of the word Czechia in English comes from a book of 1841 by Henry and Thomas Rose, A New General Biographical Dictionary Projected and Partly Arranged. Shortly before the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire, there were proposals to use the traditional name Bohemia for the newly-formed state. However, out of consideration for Slovak national aspirations, the name \\"Czecho-Slovakia\\" (later \\"Czechoslovakia\\") was adopted instead. After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the name Czechia appeared in English, alongside the official name, as a reference to all the Czech lands and to differentiate between the Czech and Slovak parts of the state. It was used at least as early as 4 January 1925; appearing in the article \\"Literary History of the Czechs\\", published by The New York Times. The name was used in the Anglophone press before the German occupation of the Czech lands in 1939. The current English ethnonym Czech comes from the Polish ethnonym associated with the area, which ultimately comes from the Czech word ƒåech. The words \\"Czechian\\", \\"Czechish\\", \\"Czechic\\" and later \\"Czech\\" (using antiquated Czech spelling) have appeared in English-language texts since the 17th century. During the 19th-century national revival, the word \\"Czech\\" was also used to distinguish between the Czech- and German-speaking peoples living in the country. The term \\"Czechia\\" is attested as early as 1569 in Latin and 1841 in English (Poselkynie starych Przjbiehuw Czeskych ‚Äì Messenger of the old Fates of Czechia). There were other early mentions in 1856 and in an 1866 report on the Austro-Prussian War. Adoption of Czechia In accordance with Resolution No. 4 I. of the UN conference on the standardization of geographic names (Geneva 1967) and Resolution No. 2 III. of the UN conference on the standardization of geographic names (Athens 1977), the Terminological Committee of the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping, and Cadaster in cooperation with the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs standardized Czechia as the English translation of ƒåesko in early 1993. Other names suggested in the 1990s included Czechomoravia or Czechlands. However, by 2000 a short name had still not been fully adopted by the Czech authorities. At that time, the Second Secretary, Press and Politics at the British Embassy in Prague, Giles Portman, showed a willingness to accept the name Czechia. Portman said in 2000, \\"Czechs still use the name ƒåesk√° republika rather than ƒåesko, and the English equivalent, the Czech Republic, rather than Czechia. Were that pattern to change, we would have no problem at all with adapting accordingly. But we feel that the initiative for that change must come from the Czech side and not from us.\\" In 2013, Czech president Milo≈° Zeman recommended the wider official use of Czechia, and on 14 April 2016, the government agreed to make Czechia the official short name. The new name was approved by the Czech cabinet on 2 May 2016 and registered on 5 July 2016. In November 2016 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented recommendations on how to use the short name \\"Czechia\\" in international contexts. On 1 June 2017, the geography department of the Faculty of Sciences of Charles University in Prague organised a special conference to assess the progress of the name's proliferation. The new short name was published in the United Nations UNTERM and UNGEGN country name databases on 17 May 2016. In September 2016, the British Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN) recommended the use of Czechia and added it as the sole form of the country name to their list of country names. On 26 September 2016, the International Organization for Standardization included the short name Czechia in the official ISO 3166 country codes list. The name Czechia and its respective translations are also included in the interinstitutional style guide of the European Union and of the Council of Europe. Multinational technology companies that adopted the name Czechia include Google, Apple, and Microsoft with Bing Maps.https://www.bing.com/maps?FORM=Z9LH2 The business network LinkedIn updated its locations to Czechia in October 2020. https://www.linkedin.com Other languages The equivalent of the Czech short form is in routine use by most other languages. In a few cases (for example Polish , Croatian and Serbian ) this form had historically been used for Bohemia. Other languages adopted new short forms such as Tshƒ´kyƒÅ in Arabic. In most cases, the new form has more or less completely replaced the formal name for most usages. In Dutch the term has been used following the dissolution of the former Czechoslovakia, and is essentially the same as Czechia but adapted to match Dutch orthography. However, usage in Spanish and French remains mixed, with the forms and only occasionally being used alongside the longer formal names and . German In German, the term applicable to the Czech part of Czechoslovakia used to be , comparable to for Slovakia. However, the term began to have negative connotations in connection with the Nazis, who used the term \\"remaining Czechia\\" when they annexed the border regions of western Czechoslovakia in 1938. Since the end of the Second World War, the term has been used instead, as suggested by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as German and Austrian linguists. is a term from the 19th century that was originally used for the Czech lands that were part of Austria-Hungary.

Littlefield was employed as Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, a position he held from July 13, 2001 to September 7, 2007. He took over as GM for Roy Smith, who had assumed the position on a temporary basis after the firing of GM Cam Bonifay on June 11. Early years In 1984, Littlefield was an assistant coach for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Pittsburgh Pirates=2003 Rule 5 draft Littlefield received a large amount of negative publicity after the Pirates lost five prospects from their minor league system with the first six picks in the 2003 Rule 5 draft, even though they had unused spots on their 40-man roster and could have protected several of the players if they had chosen to do so. Chris Shelton, who had recently been honored as the team's minor league player of the year, went with the first pick, and he was followed in short order by Rich Thompson, Frank Brooks, Jeff Bennett, and Jos√© Bautista. The Cincinnati Reds, picking seventh, had all five Pirate players listed on their draft board and were frustrated to see them all go too soon, and an anonymous executive from another American League team said that his team had also planned to take a Pirate prospect, refraining only because in his words, \\"There wasn't anything left.\\" Trading record Littlefield acquired a reputation throughout MLB as a difficult trading partner, in that his demands during negotiations were often seen as grossly excessive. It was rumored that Littlefield turned down a trade offer in 2005 with former GM of the Philadelphia Phillies, Ed Wade, in which the Pirates would swap pitcher Kip Wells for the Phillies' Ryan Howard. There were also unconfirmed reports that Littlefield turned down trading Howard for pitcher Kris Benson a year earlier. Littlefield was criticized for trading players such as Jason Schmidt, Jason Kendall, Sean Casey, Aramis Ram√≠rez, Chris Young, Gary Matthews, Jr., and Kenny Lofton for little or nothing in return. While small market teams thrive on trading established veterans for packages of talented minor leaguers, Littlefield repeatedly asked for lower-ceiling \\"Major League ready\\" prospects in return. As a result, when he left, the Pirates had a plethora of mid-to- late 20s, borderline Major Leaguers, and very few young, impact prospects within the system. This strategy runs contrary to that of successful low- payroll teams like the A's, Twins, and Marlins. In 2003, Littlefield approached the San Diego Padres with a trade proposal in which the Pirates would receive Xavier Nady, √ìliver P√©rez, and minor league pitcher Cory Stewart in exchange for star outfielder Brian Giles. The Padres refused to surrender Nady, so Littlefield and the Pirates agreed to accept Jason Bay instead. Bay immediately emerged as a star, winning the National League Rookie of the Year award in 2004, while Nady spent the next three seasons as a part-time player with the Padres and the New York Mets. Two years later, Littlefield was successful in trading for Nady in a deal for inconsistent pitcher √ìliver P√©rez, who has continued to be inconsistent with New York, as well as veteran reliever, and soon to be free agent, Roberto Hern√°ndez and the compensatory draft pick the Mets received when Hern√°ndez left as a free agent that offseason. Among his most widely lampooned transactions to date was the trade of pitcher Chris Young, in whom the Pirates had invested $1.5 million, to Montreal for Matt Herges in December 2002. Herges was promptly released in spring training, while Young was hailed as one best young pitchers in baseball four years later after having been traded from the Montreal Expos to the Texas Rangers and, finally, to the San Diego Padres, where he had an outstanding season in 2007 but has struggled since. Similarly, the 21-year-old Leo N√∫√±ez was traded to Kansas City in December 2004; in return, the Pirates received 39-year-old Benito Santiago in order fill an immediate hole at the catcher position. N√∫√±ez has had some successful stretches for the Royals; Santiago had 6 hits with the Pirates before being released one month into the 2005 season. Some argue that trading away future impact players has severely hindered the Pirates in recent years. On July 31, 2007, Littlefield traded outfielder Rajai Davis to the San Francisco Giants for pitcher Matt Morris. The move was widely criticized, as Morris, who was 7-7 with a 4.35 ERA at the time of the trade, was slated to make $9.5 million in 2008. Many were surprised that the Pirates would take on such a large contract (especially without having the Giants pick up part of it), as their 2007 Opening Day payroll was just $38.5 million. Cot's Baseball Contracts. \\"Pittsburgh Pirates\\" At the time of the trade, the Pirates were 42-62, 14.5 games out of first place.The Official Site of Major League Baseball. \\"Regular Season Standings as of 7/31/2007\\" Though he was frequently criticized for some trades that worked out poorly in the long run, Littlefield also managed to acquire the bulk of the Pirates' lineup through trades during his tenure. Jason Bay, Freddy Sanchez, Adam LaRoche, Jos√© Bautista, and Xavier Nady were all acquired through trades. In his final season as GM, only one of the seven players with over 400 at-bats on the team, Ronny Paulino, was not acquired through a trade. At the same time, this group finished in last place in their division‚Äîso even his more successful trades weren't enough to field a contender. Drafting players During Littlefield's tenure, the Pirates were widely criticized for taking players that were perceived to be more signable than talented. The most notable examples of this were in 2002 and 2007. In 2002, the Pirates passed over Melvin Upton, Jr., widely regarded as the top prospect at the time, with the first overall pick‚Äîalso passing over other highly touted prospects, including Prince Fielder, Zack Greinke, Khalil Greene, Scott Kazmir, Nick Swisher, Matt Cain, Cole Hamels and Jeff Francoeur‚Äîand drafted Bryan Bullington, who Littlefield said could be a \\"good #3 pitcher\\". After battling with injuries, Bullington was waived by the Pirates in 2008. In 2007, Littlefield and the Pirates passed over the top-ranked college hitting prospect, Matt Wieters, and instead drafted pitcher Daniel Moskos. Moskos has had an inconsistent career in the minors, while Wieters is a two-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove Award winner. Littlefield's other #1 draft picks were Paul Maholm (2003), Neil Walker (2004), Andrew McCutchen (2005), and Brad Lincoln (2006). Lincoln was drafted two picks before now superstar pitcher Clayton Kershaw was drafted by Los Angeles Latin America Under Littlefield's direction, the Pirates were less aggressive than other teams in signing players from Latin America. At the end of his tenure, the team had no Latin American impact prospects within their minor league system, and those on the major league roster were regarded by many as marginal talents, most signed or acquired before Littlefield's tenure: Jos√© Bautista, Ronny Paulino, Jose Castillo, Salom√≥n Torres, D√°maso Marte, and Tony Armas. The Pirates were widely criticized for failing to employ a Latin American scouting director until hiring Rene Gayo nearly three years after Littlefield took over as General Manager. In addition, the team's facilities were widely considered to be among the worst in baseball. While other teams have recognized the benefits of signing such talent at relatively reasonable prices, the Pirates did not extend a signing bonus of more than $85,000 to a Latin American prospect during Littlefield's tenure. Some contend (particularly beat writer Dejan Kovacevic) that, as much as any other decision during Littlefield's tenure, the lack of emphasis on competing in Latin America was one of the most confounding and debilitating for the organization. Firing Littlefield was fired on the morning of September 7, 2007. The announcement came shortly before the Pirates could clinch their seventh consecutive losing season under his management. The Pirates never finished higher than 4th place in the NL Central. Brian Graham, the director of player development for the Pirates, served as interim general manager until new Pirates GM Neal Huntington took over September 25, 2007. The Aftermath In the first 2 years following the Dave Littlefield era, almost every player acquired by Littlefield was purged from the Pirates major league roster, most of them via trade. These trades were made primarily to restock a farm system that was left completely bereft of impact talent and needed to be restocked in order to make the Pirates a long term contender. While many of these trades were roundly criticized by fans and media alike, Neal Huntington, Pirates GM at the time the trades were made, justified them by saying that he wasn't breaking up the 1927 Yankees. Chicago Cubs On December 19, 2007, Littlefield was named a scout for the Chicago Cubs. Detroit Tigers On October 20, 2014, Littlefield was named a scout for the Detroit Tigers. On August 11, 2015, Littlefield was promoted to vice president of player development. ReferencesExternal links *Littlefield's official biography with the Pirates.

Keane, page 459 The name H√ºdavendig√¢r was a poetic Ottoman name for Bursa, from the Persian word , KhodavandegƒÅr, meaning God, Lord. Economy As of 1920, the British had described the vilayet as being \\"one of the most prosperous in Anatolia.\\" The northern and western regions were mainly occupied by Christians. Highlands were populated by Turkish immigrants from Europe. The area near the Sea of Marmara was considered the most fertile area, with a large portion of the vilayet being \\"marshy and fever-stricken, especially between Bursa and Panderma.\\" The vilayet produced wheat, barley, maize, beans, and seeds in the northern and western regions. Throughout the region, opium, tobacco and cotton was also produced. The area around Lake Iznik produced rice. The Balƒ±khisar area produced \\"some of the finest fruit grown in Turkey.\\" Barley is also of large production in the highlands and is exported to England. Silk production was considered the most valuable of the region during the 20th century. The vilayet had schools devoted to silk production. The region had obtained silkworm seed from France. Bursa was the heart of silk production. The silk was mainly exported, sometimes as thread or cocoons. In the mid 19th-century, a disease spread through the silkworm, causing a decline in production. As of 1920, the disease was eradicated and business was steady. Cotton production remained steady, and towels and robes were common items produced from cotton. Velvet and felt were also produced. Felt was used for saddles and other equestrian related goods. The area also made tanned leather and carpet. The city of K√ºtahya created tiling and pottery. Soap and flour was also produced in the vilayet. Lignite was being mined in the area between Kirmasti (today Mustafakemalpa≈üa) and Mihali√ß (today Karacabey). Towards the end of World War 1, the region was exporting approximately 300 tons of lignite monthly to Istanbul. Chromite, mercury, marble, fuller's earth, and antimony were also plentiful in the region in the early 20th century. Environmental history The region was described as having \\"beautiful forests\\" in the 1920s, estimating 23,000 square kilometers. The area of Ainegeul was described by the British as having the \\"richest\\" timber. Gediz had a large oak population.

The Fairy Folk are ruled by the Lady in Green, who believes that only a sacrifice can help her people hold their own against the advancing modern world. Kate detests the Lady in Green at first, but the two of them have much in common. Both are strong-willed, highly independent, and capable of enormous self- discipline. Kate's refusal to be drugged or manipulated in other ways soon gains her a measure of respect among the Fairy Folk. Little by little she gains knowledge of their underground kingdom, while her view of the Lady in Green gradually changes. Kate begins to understand and even to respect the Lady in Green. In the end, however, Kate chooses to leave the Fairy Folk in order to save Christopher, destroying the fairy kingdom in the process. Christopher then takes Cecily to London to live with his sister Jennifer. When Christopher returns he proposes to Kate, and she accepts. Kate is granted freedom when Queen Elizabeth I ascends the throne. Characters *Kate Sutton‚ÄîAn older teenager, Kate is intelligent, stubborn, and direct. She views herself as a realist and has little use for ballads or the Arthurian romances. Outwardly, she appears cold and confident: inwardly, she feels ugly and uncertain of herself. Kate has frequently been compared (negatively) with her younger sister. Her time in the Elvenwood, her first experience without Alicia at her side, helps give her confidence that her gifts, while different from Alicia's, are no less important. *Christopher Heron‚ÄîChristopher, a young man in his early twenties, has a caring nature that he sometimes masks with sarcasm and outward hostility. He does not want Kate or his brother to recognize how distraught he is at Cecily's disappearance. Kate's relationship with him is initially stormy, but their mutual imprisonment by the Fairy Folk helps Christopher to become more open with Kate. *Sir Geoffry Heron‚ÄîUpright and unimaginative, Sir Geoffrey had no idea that his wife's family had ties to a secret cult beneath Elvenwood Hall. He, with Christopher, initially believes that his daughter is dead. Busy with his service to Queen Mary, he also does not realize just how deeply Christopher is grieving Cecily, or that Christopher might put himself in danger to save her. *Master John‚ÄîThe steward of Elvenwood Hall, Master John is both greedy and unscrupulous. He does not believe in the religion of the Fairy Folk, but he aids them because of the money they offer him. *Old Dorothy‚ÄîLike many longtime castle servants, Old Dorothy is aware of Sir John's dealings with the Fairy Folk. She probably suspects Cecily's real fate, but she is too frightened of the Fairy Folk to tell Sir Geoffrey. *The Fairy Queen‚ÄîAlso known as the Lady in Green, she is honest, scrupulous, and cold. She is never intentionally cruel, but she will take extreme measures when she believes the overall good of her people is at stake. *Alicia Sutton‚ÄîPretty but featherbrained, Alicia is several years younger than Kate. She has good intentions but frequently does not realize that actions she views as innocent can have serious consequences. *Princess Elizabeth‚ÄîLater Queen Elizabeth I, the princess is strong-willed but realistic. She understands that fighting with her older half-sister Queen Mary will not help her situation, but she intends to right Mary's wrongs as soon as she becomes queen, including the wrong done to Kate. *Cecily Heron‚ÄîFour years old, Cecily is little affected by her long months with the Fairy Folk, during which she lived as one of them. Fortunately for Cecily, they considered children unable to go through the teind training that Christopher underwent. Themes The story is structured around the ballad of Tam Lin. The sacrifice of the \\"teind,\\" or \\"tenth,\\" which plays a major role in the novel as well as the ballad, is based on Scottish fairy lore. According to these legends, the fairies live beneath mounds or barrows under the earth. Since Hades was considered to be a place beneath the ground by many early Christians-- Hippolytus, for instance, called it \\"a locality beneath the earth, in which the light of the world does not shine\\"‚Äîmany Scottish ballads considered the fairies to essentially be vassals of Satan. As such, they had to periodically pay the devil for their use of the land. Paying at the correct time of year was considered essential. Since half-yearly rents in Scotland were due on All Saints' Day, or \\"Hallowmas,\\" local laws may have contributed to this tradition. In the novel, however, the Fairy Folk believe they are offering the teind to their gods. The Perilous Gard also contains references to the Thomas the Rhymer ballad and to the Arthurian legends, as well. Kate initially dislikes British folklore because she believes that it is unrealistic. As the story unfolds, however, she finds that the folklore she once despised is based on fact, and that understanding it may allow her to save Christopher from the Fairy Queen. Author J.B. Cheaney, in her review of the book, notes that it presents a nuanced view of the conflict between paganism and Christianity. The pagans are scrupulously honest, avoiding some of the pretentiousness of Christian Elizabethan society. At the same time, theirs is a \\"nature-worship paired with blood sacrifice, mindless ecstasy marred by fear, a relentless eye-for-eye accounting system that left no room for compassion.\\" Kate ultimately decides to leave the Fairy Folk because she considers their society cruel and their religious beliefs wrong. She continues to respect them, however, and in some ways she misses their simple lifestyle. Publication history The Perilous Gard was first released in 1974 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. It was reprinted in 2001, and RecordedBooks produced an audiobook version that same year. The audiobook is narrated by Jill Tanner.

Three * John addresses the church of Sardis for being \\"dead\\" or unaware of things to come, whose works are not perfect before God. * John addresses the church of Philadelphia to persevere with what little strength they have; to hold fast so that no one takes their crown. * John addresses the church of Laodicea to repent from investing in material riches that make them miserable; rather, invest in the refined gold of Him who has overcome. Four * The heavenly throne with a rainbow around it, having the One seated in it, is revealed. * Twenty-four surrounding thrones seated with twenty-four crowned elders appear. * The four living creatures present themselves; each having six wings full of eyes, one having the face of a lion, another as a calf, the third as a man, and the last as an eagle. The first vision that the author experiences is that of entering Heaven and seeing God's throne (). In Revelation, God is described as \\"having the appearance like that of jasper and carnelian with a rainbow-like halo as brilliant as emerald\\". Around God's throne are twenty four other thrones, on which sit elders in white robes. From the throne come thunder and lightning and, in front of the throne, the author sees seven torches and a sea of crystal. The author then sees four creatures which have six wings and are covered in eyes (). The creatures are giving eternal thanks to God and, whenever one of them bows down to worship God, the twenty four elders around God's throne bow down to worship God. Five * A book/scroll secured by seven seals is revealed in the right hand of Him/the One (God) who sits on the throne(). * It is made known that only \\"The Lion that is from the Tribe of Judah\\" () is worthy to open this book/scroll. * The Lamb, with seven horns and seven eyes, takes the book/scroll from Him who sits on the throne (). * All heavenly beings sing praise and honor The Lamb ().

Seven * The servants of God are revealed, those who are to be sealed before the destruction of the Earth. * The number of these servants is given as one hundred and forty-four thousand who are from twelve tribes of Israel. * Twelve thousand from each tribe are sealed: from Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Simeon, Levi, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. * A great multitude who came out of the Great Tribulation present themselves in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.

Nine * The fifth angel sounds his trumpet; this signals the \\"First woe\\". * A star falls from heaven to the earth and is given the key to the bottomless pit. * It opens the pit and smoke rises, darkening the air and sunlight. * The Locusts come out of the smoke, from the pit, and Abaddon commands them to torment any man who does not have the seal of God on his forehead for five months. * The sixth angel sounds his trumpet for the \\"Second woe\\". * The four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates are released. * The four angels of the Euphrates raise an army of 200 million cavalry who kill a third of mankind. Ten * Another mighty angel (the seventh) appears standing with one foot on the sea and the other on land, holding an opened little book. * The angel cries out and seven thunders utter their voices. * The apostle John is commanded to seal up what the thunders uttered in the little book, and is told not to write about what was said. * The angel declares that the mystery of God would be revealed on the sounding of the seventh trumpet. * John is instructed to take the little book and to eat it. Eleven * John is given a measuring rod to measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship in it. * It is brought to John's attention that the nations will tread under foot, the holy city of the temple, for forty-two months (1,260 days).'' * During that same time, two witnesses, dressed in sackcloth, will prophesy and this torments the nations. * The first mention of the Beast is told to John, who will overcome the two witnesses and kill them. * For three and a half days, the people of the earth will celebrate the death of the two witnesses who've tormented them for three and half years. * God will resurrect the two witnesses; this strikes fear on everyone witnessing their revival, and the two witnesses ascend to heaven. * In the next hour, a great earthquake occurs and kills seven thousand people, destroying a tenth of the city. * The \\"Third woe\\" is signaled by the sound of the seventh trumpet. * Loud voices in heaven proclaim Christ as ruler forever under the \\"Kingdom of our Lord\\". * Thanks is given to God, the Almighty and praise for the wrath that came, the dead who were judged, and the bond-servants rewarded. * The temple of God in heaven opens and the Ark of the covenant appears in His temple. * Lightning and the peals of thunder occur followed by an earthquake and a great hailstorm. TwelveWar in Heaven= War breaks out in Heaven. Historicist view In the traditional historicist view, Joseph Mede (1627) identified the war of Michael the Archangel and the Dragon as the fall of Paganism by Christianity. This concept was adopted by Campegius Vitringa (1705), Dr. Charles Daubuz (1720), Bishop Newton, John Cunninghame, and Edward Bishop Elliott (1837). Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet (17th Century), even marks the fall of Paganism to the death of Galerius Maximus in the year 311. =Woman= Landscape with St John the Evangelist at Patmos by Tobias Verhaecht, 1598. The woman and the dragon are shown in the sky. A woman gives birth to a son who is to \\"rule the nations with an iron scepter\\". She is then pursued by a Dragon with seven heads and ten horns, which wants to kill her baby. However, the child was taken away by God. Immediately after this, Michael and his angels fought the Dragon and his followers in Heaven. The Dragon lost the war, and was thrown down to Earth along with all of its followers. The Dragon pursued the woman and tried to drown her, but the water drained away into the ground. The woman grew wings and flew away. The Dragon was enraged, and went to war with the remainder of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God. Thirteen A beast with ten horns atop seven heads rises out of the sea and is given authority to rule the Earth by the Dragon. The people of Earth marvel at the beast's abilities and worship it and the Dragon. (). The beast is able to control the entire planet, and goes to war against the saints. Following this, another beast arises, this time from the ground. This beast, which resembles a lamb but speaks like a dragon, exercises authority on behalf of the previous, and causes \\"great and miraculous signs\\" by which to make people follow the original beast. The second beast, also known as the false prophet, forces all who do not bear the Mark of God to receive the Mark of the Beast on their right hand or forehead, declaring that \\"no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.\\" (). Fourteen * The Lamb appears on Mount Zion with 144,000 blameless male virgins as first fruits, who sing a new song and follow the Lamb. * An angel appears in midair proclaiming the gospel. * A second angel announces Babylon's fall. * A third angel declares God's wrath on those who worship or receive the mark of the beast. This requires endurance by the faithful. * A heavenly voice pronounces the blessedness and reward of the dead \\"in the Lord\\"(). * An angel invites a crowned \\"son of man\\", seated on a cloud, to use his sickle to harvest the earth. * Another angel, tending an altar fire, invites yet another angel to harvest the earth's ripe grapes, at which he does so. Huge volumes of blood are produced from trampling these within a wine press. Fifteen John writes of seven angels with seven plagues, the last plagues ever to occur. He states that until the plagues are complete no one can enter the Temple of God. the seven plagues consist of: Sixteen The False Prophet, Apoc. XVI, Beatus de Facundus. The seven Vial/Bowl judgments are similar in nature to the Trumpet judgments, but far more serious for there will be no warning when they come. In addition, there are three key differences between the Trumpet judgments and the Vial/Bowl judgments: firstly, the Trumpet judgments are plagues that bring partial devastation and plagues upon 1/3 of nature and people, while the Vial/Bowl judgments are more severe direct assaults against humanity and nature, thus bringing more chaos on the earth than the Trumpet judgments. Lastly, the Trumpet judgments offer a possibility of redemption and repentance, while the Vial judgments do not; the Vial judgments are a literal assault on those who have taken the mark of the Beast, and to those who are considered incorrigibles and arrogantly unrepentant, thus making them impossible to save. The Vial/Bowl judgments are listed below. * Noisome and grievous sores (possibly boils or carbuncles) on the worshipers of the Beast. These sores only affect those bearing the Mark of the Beast and the people who worship his image. * Sea turns to blood. * Rivers turn to blood. * A major heatwave causes the Sun to burn with intense heat and to scorch people with fire. () * The kingdom of the beast is plunged into darkness. () * The Euphrates River dries up to facilitate the crossing of the armies from the east, on their way to Israel for the battle of Armageddon. This event corresponds with Daniel 11:44. * Worldwide earthquake leveling every mountain into the sea followed by huge hailstones and lightning. The Earth's geography and topography will be drastically altered forever, as every mountain and hill will be leveled, and every island will either be removed from its foundations or disappear. The earthquakes are accompanied by 100-lb hailstones. The seven bowls of wrath. Ottheinrich-bible, c. 1531 AD. Some Christians believe that the seals and trumpets will occur during the first half of the tribulation. The vial judgments will occur during the second half, as the first judgment refers to those with the mark of the beast. The mark will not be implemented until the Antichrist appears to be resurrected after suffering a fatal head wound, being reincarnated by Satan, and after he defiles the Temple; and this will happen precisely at the midpoint of the tribulation. Thus, the vial judgments will be more severe. Others, such as many historicists, argue that the seals generally cover man's history from after the first coming of Christ up to the End time, with the trumpets generally covering the Tribulation, and the Bowls reserved for the Wrath of God period ‚Äî preceding the Millennium.) Next, seven angels are given vials or bowls to pour out upon the earth which contain \\"the seven last plagues\\". These last judgments will complete God's wrath. The first bowl produces unbearable sores on humanity. The second bowl results in the death of every living thing in the sea. The third bowl turns the inland waters into blood. The fourth bowl causes the sun to scorch man. The fifth bowl brings darkness over the beast's kingdom. The sixth bowl dries up the river Euphrates to prepare the way for the kings of the east and causes the armies of the Antichrist being gathered together to wage the battle of Armageddon. The seventh bowl results in a devastating earthquake followed by giant hailstones (). Seventeen The woman who rides on the beast is introduced in the seventeenth chapter. The entire chapter is quite symbolic, but an angel explains to John the meaning of what he is seeing. The woman, who is referred to as \\"the great prostitute\\", \\"is the great city who rules over the kings of the earth\\" (), who is envied by the ten kings who give power to the beast and is destroyed by those ten kings. \\"They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled\\" (). introduces a Woman dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold, precious stones and pearls. She sits on a scarlet beast with 7 heads (representing 7 kings) and 10 horns (representing 10 kings). She is described as the \\"Mother of Harlots\\" and is drunk with the blood of the saints indicating her intense involvement in persecution. She comes to power and rules the kings and peoples of the earth. Eventually, the 10 kings ruling the kingdoms that give their power to the Beast grow tired of her influence and overthrow her. Her destruction will cause the kings and merchants of the earth to mourn her death. Eighteen Fall of the Tower of Babel. Cornelis Anthonisz, 1547 Babylon falls. This causes the merchants of the earth to weep because no one is able to buy their products anymore. Nineteen The marriage between Jesus and his wife, who has prepared herself and clothed in white linen, occurs (). A \\"white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True\\" is introduced. \\"With Justice he makes war\\" (). Jesus Christ is the rider mentioned in chapter twelve. John references Psalm 2:9 when he writes \\"He will rule them with an iron scepter\\" (). This is when the first war between the people of God and the rest of the world takes place. After the war has finished the beast and the false prophet are taken captives and thrown into the lake of fire, while all other enemy combatants are killed and their corpses left out on the field for the birds of the sky to devour their flesh (). Jesus returns to earth followed by the armies of Heaven, which are seen riding white horses dressed in fine linen. The Beast and his False Prophet make war with the armies of Christ but are defeated. In the aftermath of their defeat, the Antichrist and False Prophet are cast alive into the Lake of Fire, which burns forever. Twenty Satan is bound in the Abyss for a thousand years. The Saints who died are resurrected (Resurrection of the SaintsCatholic Encyclopedia: General Resurrection: \\"These three characteristics, identity, entirety, and immortality, will be common to the risen bodies of the just and the wicked. But the bodies of the saints shall be distinguished by four transcendent endowments, often called qualities.\\") and begin their thousand-year reign with Christ (). After the thousand years, Satan is released from the Abyss to deceive the nations and gather Gog and Magog and the people of the world to encircle the camp of the saints and the city of Jerusalem. A fire comes down from God out of heaven and devours them. Satan is then thrown into the Lake of Fire forever (). The wicked dead and all of those who died during the thousand-year reign of Christ are resurrected and judged (). Twenty-one A new heaven and a new earth with the New Jerusalem (the World to Come) replace the old heaven and earth (). This is a reference to Genesis 1:1 and Isaiah 65:17. Many theologians interpret it allegorically as explaining the drastic difference in this world and 'heaven' when Christ has been acknowledged as having returned. \\"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\\" (). Twenty-two A description of the heavenly state, under the figures of the water of life and the tree of life, and of the throne of God and the Lamb. () The truth and certain fulfilling of all the prophetic visions, The Holy Spirit and the wife/bride of the Lamb, invite, and say, \\"Come\\". () The closing blessing. ().

His father is of Lucanian descent and his mother of Calabrian descent. Growing up in a musical family (mother Rosemary Conte is a New Jersey jazz singer), Conte followed his passion for music early at seven years old when he began playing drums. At ten years old, he picked up his brother John Conte's guitar and started making up songs. One year later, the Conte brothers recorded their first \\"album\\" in the family living room with Steve singing, playing guitar and drums, writing the songs, and \\"producing\\". He also played backup with his mother in many Jersey Shore venues. To pursue his musical talents further, he earned a full scholarship to attend Rutgers University and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in music with a focus on jazz guitar performance. At Rutgers, his classmates included fellow musicians Terrence Blanchard, Ralph Peterson Jr., and Frank Lacy and studied under the tutelage of Ted Dunbar, Kenny Barron, Paul Jeffrey, and Larry Ridley. Upon graduation, he moved to New York City and took his first road gig with legendary jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat & Tears. Career During his early years in New York (1986‚Äì87), Conte landed a variety of gigs; he was a guitarist and musical director for Prince and The Revolution singer Jill Jones, session and live guitarist with James Brown producers Dan Hartman and Charlie Midnight (Steve's first record date was the Hartman-produced Joy album by Paul King) as well as a stint with New Jersey rocker Glen Burtnick and jazz fusion band Bushrock led by keyboard virtuoso, Delmar Brown. In 1988, along with blues harp master Rob Paparozzi, Conte and his brother, John, founded the blues band The Hudson River Rats whose residency at the Acme Bar & Grill in the West Village afforded them the chance to meet and play with many blues greats and pop stars. The brothers performed with Etta James, Charlie Musselwhite, James Cotton, Johnny Adams, Reese Wynans (Stevie Ray Vaughan), Phoebe Snow, Cyndi Lauper, John Waite, Richie Hayward (Little Feat), Will Lee, Lou Marini (The Blues Brothers), Carole King, The Uptown Horns, Steve Clark (Def Leppard), and many others. Legendary funk and soul drummer Bernard \\"Pretty\\" Purdie eventually joined the band after jamming with them many times. This was Steve's entrance into the New York City studio musician scene, where he still works today. Besides numerous playing and singing on film, television soundtracks, commercials and video game music, he's been recorded on albums with many of his childhood heroes; The J. Geils Band frontman Peter Wolf (Fool's Parade, 1998) and James Brown saxophone player Maceo Parker (Funk Overload, 1998) as well as the single \\"Fear of the Unknown\\" with rock legend Suzi Quatro. Conte first became known to the music industry in the early 1990s as the songwriter and guitarist of the band Company of Wolves (Mercury Records). After the Wolves' breakup in 1992, he went on to form the band Crown Jewels with John Conte, and in 2003, the pair made an album under the name The Contes. In 2004, Steve Conte joined the New York Dolls as a guitarist and vocalist, where he would remain until 2010 when he joined Michael Monroe's new band. Conte also worked with composer Yoko Kanno and lyricist Tim Jensen on soundtracks to various popular anime series. Those works include the opening theme to Wolf's Rain, titled \\"Stray\\", as well as the tracks \\"Heaven's Not Enough\\" and \\"Could You Bite the Hand?\\". All three appear on the OST albums. As a guest vocalist for the Kanno-led Seatbelts, Steve also sang vocals in episodes of Cowboy Bebop, as well as the 2001 film, most notably the song \\"Call Me Call Me\\", as well as \\"Words That We Couldn't Say\\", \\"No Reply\\" and \\"Diggin'\\". He also sang \\"Rain\\" on the OST CD, which is sung by Mai Yamane and featured in the series. He would later sing alongside Shanti Snyder on \\"Living Inside the Shell\\", the ending theme to 2004's Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG. Conte also performed on the duet \\"The Garden of Everything\\" with Japanese singer Maaya Sakamoto on her RahXephon-related single \\"Tune the Rainbow\\". In 2007, Steve provided the vocals for the video game Sonic and the Secret Rings. He sings the closing credits song titled \\"Worth a Chance\\", as well as the game's main theme \\"Seven Rings in Hand\\". Conte formed the band Steve Conte & The Crazy Truth and produced a debut album on October 20, 2009, which was released through Var√®se Sarabande Records. In 2010, Conte joined Michael Monroe's new band, The Michael Monroe Band, where he is a guitarist, along with fellow New York Doll and bassist Sami Yaffa. In September 2014, Steve provided solo acoustic guitar accompaniment for Angelina Jordan, winner of Norway's Got Talent (Norske Talenter), on the American television program The View.

Most recently, Curry was the head coach at Georgia State University, which began competing in college football in 2010. Previously, Curry served as the head football coach at the Georgia Institute of Technology (1980‚Äì1986), the University of Alabama (1987‚Äì1989), and the University of Kentucky (1990‚Äì1996). Between coaching jobs at Kentucky and Georgia State, Curry was a football analyst for ESPN. He played football at Georgia Tech (1962‚Äì1964) and then played for ten seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with four teams: the Green Bay Packers (1965‚Äì1966), the Baltimore Colts (1967‚Äì1972), the Houston Oilers (1973), and the Los Angeles Rams (1974). Early life and playing career Curry was born in College Park, Georgia. A 1965 graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in industrial management, Curry starred at center for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team from 1962 to 1964 under legendary coach Bobby Dodd. He was selected as a future draft choice by the Green Bay Packers in the final round (twentieth) of the 1964 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he was an NFL Champion for the 1965 Green Bay Packers, and again in 1966 with Super Bowl I. In his second year, he was the starting center for Green Bay in their 35-10 Super Bowl I victory at the Los Angeles Coliseum. Curry was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the 1967 NFL expansion draft on February 9 after he was left unprotected by Vince Lombardi who chose to keep Ken Bowman as the Packers' new starting center.Christopulos, Mike. \\"Bowman Preaches Gospel; Minister Without Portfolio,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, Thursday, October 10, 1968. Curry never saw action for the Saints who traded him one month later on March 6 to the Baltimore Colts along with three draft picks, one of which was that year's first overall selection (Bubba Smith), in exchange for Gary Cuozzo, Butch Allison and a 1967 seventeenth rounder. The request to include Curry in the transaction was made by Colts head coach Don Shula who admired his special teams versatility.Hurt, Cecil. \\"On New Orleans visit, Bill Curry recalls his short Sainthood,\\" The Tuscaloosa (AL) News, Tuesday, December 12, 1989. Through his tremendous work ethic and tenacity, Curry slowly developed into a first rate NFL center. He was the Colts' starting center during their NFL Championship season of 1968, and was viewed as a reliable force on the offensive line, and a team leader as well. Like most of his Colts teammates, he remains bewildered by their stunning 16-7 loss in Super Bowl III at the hands of Joe Namath and the New York Jets in Miami's Orange Bowl. The Colts had finished the 1968 season with a record of 13-1 and avenged their only loss that year with a 34-0 devastation of the Cleveland Browns in the NFL Championship contest. They were heavy favorites to defeat the upstart Jets of the upstart AFL when disaster struck: after carrying the play to New York for most of the first quarter, due to an interception in the Jets' end zone, and two missed field goals, Baltimore had nothing to show for it. Trailing 7-0 late in the first half, and feeling the pressure, the Colts attempted a flea- flicker to help reverse their fortunes. However, after having caught the Jets' defense completely unaware, QB Earl Morrall failed to spot WR Jimmy Orr wide open near the end zone, and instead threw a wobbly pass underneath that was intercepted. In retrospect, this was Baltimore's one last golden opportunity to get back into the game. It was particularly dispiriting for Curry, who, (having no one to block due to the Jets biting hard on the initial hand-off) had a perfect view of Orr, and was sure the play would result in a touchdown. \\"I looked up, and saw Jimmy open, I don't know what (could've) happened.\\" he said. To add insult to injury, following the loss, Curry and his teammates were subjected to unusually harsh criticisms, including unsubstantiated claims that they had somehow thrown the game. The Colts did go on to win Super Bowl V and the tightly-knit, veteran team made a valiant defense of that title, which ended, along with the (owner) Carroll Rosenbloom era, with a loss to Don Shula's Dolphins at the Orange Bowl in the 1971 AFC title game. After ownership of the Colts was transferred to Bob Irsay the team's championship spirit, which was emblematic of the franchise under Rosenbloom's reign, was dissolved by newly installed GM Joe Thomas. Curry's close confidant, and Colts legend, John Unitas was unceremoniously benched in 1972, and many of those responsible for the franchise's success in years past were shipped out of Baltimore‚ÄîCurry among them. He learned that he was traded via a collect call from Thomas at the Pro Bowl in Dallas. During a brief stint with the flagging Houston Oilers in 1973, Curry suffered a catastrophic leg injury when he was hit in the back of the leg by Rams' great, Merlin Olsen. Though he did not retire until August 1975, the injury essentially ended his playing career. Curry's NFL career is also notable for his efforts in leadership positions (including a stint as president) at the NFLPA. Though their fledgling efforts at self-assertion were largely unsuccessful, it can be argued that men like Curry and Colts teammate John Mackey laid the groundwork for the vastly improved wages and working conditions that exist for NFL players today. Coaching career Prior to his first head coaching assignment, Curry served as an assistant at Georgia Tech in 1976 and then for three seasons in the NFL (1977‚Äì1979) as Offensive Line Coach with the Green Bay Packers. Curry returned to Georgia Tech in 1980 as head football coach. While it has been reported that Curry's first head coaching decision was to dismiss the quarterbacks coach, Steve Spurrier, he denies this. Curry said, \\"I never fired Steve. Georgia Tech fired the [Pepper Rodgers] staff before I got there. Then while I was deliberating who from that staff to retain, Steve took the Duke [assistant's] job.\\" Curry led his team to a 9‚Äì2‚Äì1 record in 1985 and a win in the All-American Bowl. For his efforts, he was named the ACC Coach of the Year in 1985 by the Associated Press and the Atlantic Coast Conference media. Curry posted a 34‚Äì43‚Äì4 record over seven years at his alma mater, including winning seasons in 1982 (6‚Äì5), 1984 (6‚Äì4‚Äì1), and 1985 (9‚Äì2‚Äì1) and won the All-American Bowl. Curry then accepted a job as head coach at the University of Alabama. There he posted a record of 26‚Äì10, won a share of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) title in 1989 and made bowl appearances every year of his three-year tenure. In September 1988, he refused to fly his Alabama team to play Texas A&M; because of fears that Hurricane Gilbert would harm his players. The hurricane never reached Texas A&M; at College Station, Texas, and Aggies coach Jackie Sherrill claimed Curry used the threat of weather as an excuse because his quarterback was injured. The game was rescheduled for December 1, when Alabama routed A&M;, 30‚Äì10. Curry also suspended Alabama quarterback Jeff Dunn for breaking team rules prior to the 1988 Sun Bowl against Army. After posting a 10‚Äì1 regular season record (the only blemish being a third loss in a row to Auburn), Curry's 1989 Crimson Tide squad shared the SEC title with Auburn and Tennessee‚ÄîAlabama's first SEC title since 1981‚Äîand earned the berth in the 1990 Sugar Bowl, where they lost to the Miami Hurricanes, 33‚Äì25. Curry was honored in 1989 as the SEC Coach of the Year and received the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. Curry's three-year record of 26‚Äì10 gave him the highest winning percentage among Alabama coaches since Bear Bryant. However, Curry had an 0‚Äì3 record against Auburn. Indeed, he would never beat the Tigers in 12 tries during his career. Perhaps his best-remembered on-field act with Alabama came during the 1990 Sugar Bowl, when he castigated receiver Prince Wimbley for celebrating a first down against Miami with a dance. Curry called Wimbley to the sideline, grabbed him by the jersey, and lectured him. As ABC game cameras showed, Wimbley turned away and Curry grabbed his face mask and brought him into eye-to-eye contact.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyTm8buN2Kk In early 1990, Alabama tendered Curry a new contract which contained provisions he disliked, including no raise and removal of his power to hire and fire assistants. Curry was particularly upset by this since he'd led the Tide to a share of its first SEC title and its first major-bowl appearance since the Bryant era. He responded by accepting an offer to become the head coach at the University of Kentucky. In 1993, Curry's Wildcat squad posted a 6‚Äì5 regular season record and earned a spot in the Peach Bowl, Kentucky's first bowl game in nine years. The Wildcats lost that game to Clemson, 14‚Äì13. As it turned out, this would be his only non-losing record in seven seasons in Lexington. His 1994 team only went 1-10, still the worst in modern Wildcat football history. Curry was asked to step down after the 1996 season and was succeeded by Hal Mumme. Curry joined ESPN in 1997 as a college football game analyst. His primary assignment was the ESPN2 College Football Saturday Night telecast, along with selected bowl games. After 10 years away from the sideline, Curry was chosen as Georgia State University's first head football coach in 2008, and retired after three seasons. Honors Bill Curry is a member of the state of Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the American Football Coaches Association Ethics Committee.

Demographics At the beginning of the 20th century it reportedly had an area of 91,620 km2, while the preliminary results of the first Ottoman census of 1885 (published in 1908) gave the population as 1,088,100.Asia by A. H. Keane, page 459 The accuracy of the population figures ranges from \\"approximate\\" to \\"merely conjectural\\" depending on the region from which they were gathered. As of 1920, less than 10% of the population was described as being Christian, with majority of Christian populations by the sea. History It was formed in 1864 by adding to the old eyalet of Karaman the western half of Adana, and part of southeastern Anatolia. Economy The population was for the most part agricultural and pastoral. The only industries were carpetweaving and the manufacture of cotton and silk stuffs. There were mines of chrome, mercury, sulphur, cinnabar, argentiferous lead and rock salt. The principal exports were salt, minerals, opium, cotton, cereals, wool and livestock; and the imports cloth-goods, coffee, rice and petroleum.

With his co-worker, David Cushman, he won the 1999 Lasker Award for: \\"developing an innovative approach to drug design based on protein structure and using it to create the ACE inhibitors, powerful oral agents for the treatment of high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease\\". Ondetti was born and raised in Buenos Aires and received a PhD in chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires, in his hometown, in 1957. In 1960 he moved to The Squibb Institute for Medical Research in New Jersey where he researched and developed Captopril in 1975. Early life Miguel A. Ondetti was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina; on May 23, 1930.Ondetti's background was Italian. His mother was an Argentine-born Italian, while his father's family had first emigrated from Italy to Paris, then to Argentina. Despite this, Ondetti considered himself a \\"first- generation Argentine\\". Ondetti's father practiced a family craft of making garden furniture from cement that imitated tree trunks. Following the mid-1930s he became a night watchman. His mother was a housewife who cared for Miguel and his only brother, who is two years older. Ondetti's first experience with chemistry was experimenting with his older brother. Miguel tried to electroplate a knife using a copper sulfate solution, only to shock himself. Education Both Ondetti brothers went to a vocational high school to study bookkeeping and accounting. At the age of 16, Miguel Ondetti worked a day job while conducting his studies at night. Ondetti stated, \\"But then, I was already interested in being scientist, I think probably from the year that I started high school\\" in his 1995 interview. His interest in chemistry stems from book borrowing from the public library. After graduating commercial high school, Ondetti experienced a major setback. The University of Buenos Aires denied admission because he did not receive a baccalaureate from an academic high school. Not discouraged, Ondetti audited his classes and received his baccalaureate in just two years. The University of Buenos Aires subsequently accepted him to their chemistry program. Ondetti supported himself during his university years by working as a bookkeeper, using his first high school degree. He managed to get an early shift at the Department of Energy. This allowed him to attend the required laboratory classes in the afternoon. Ondetti's experience with chemistry laboratory was unfamiliar to his previous knowledge in bookkeeping, but was not off-putting. Ondetti stated that his main interest was biology, \\"but one can't understand biology without chemistry\\". He used this for his motivation to studying chemistry. This philosophy has been strongly utilized in the past 30 years, long after Ondetti stated this fact. Ondetti studied chemistry in the early 1950s. The program at University of Buenos Aires was similar to a combined BA/MS program in American education. He spent five years learning organic, physical, inorganic, biological and analytical chemistry. This was standard at the time, with the transition to a more focused program occurring during Ondetti's 4th year, making Ondetti one of the last recipients of the generalized degree. The rationale behind the very broad program was that chemists needed to be prepared for all types of industries such as paint, petrochemical or the pharmaceutical industry At the end of Ondetti's five years, he received a Licentiate in 1955. In the 1950s, Argentina experienced political turmoil and slow economic growth. Many university professors moved to industry jobs, including the head of organic chemistry at the University of Buenos Aires, Dr. Venancio Deulofeu. Ondetti accepted a research training scholarship offered by Squibb following the suggestion from a classmate. Early career=The Squibb Institute for Medical Research, Argentina The Argentine government gave an exclusive license to Squibb to manufacture antibodies in the country. To supplement the fermentation plant, Squibb constructed The Squibb Institute for Medical Research. This presented a truly unique opportunity for Ondetti, allowing him to work in one of the most advanced labs in Argentina with world class scientists such as Dr. Deulofeu and Dr. Alfredo Sordelli. Another quirk about the Squibb laboratory was that Ondetti was not an official employee because he was a scholarship-research scientist, enabling him to focus on his thesis. Dr. Deulofeu was the head of chemistry at Squibb and his interests included alkaloid and carbohydrate chemistry. Ondetti reluctantly worked on carbohydrates for one year, after which Deulofeu offered him a job at Squibb. He refused, citing \\"I turned it down, because Deulofeu was an outstanding scientist, but he was very cold in the interaction with his collaborators\\". Realizing his mistake after one week of work at another company, he went back to Squibb and received a position there, resuming work on this thesis in 1957. Ondetti received his PhD from the University of Buenos Aires in 1960. As an employee as Squibb, Ondetti focused on alkaloid chemistry. Argentina's rich biodiversity allowed Squibb to screen many plants for unique and useful alkaloids. Any potential drug candidates were tested at The Squibb Research Institute in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The Squibb Research Institute in New Jersey was headed by Asger F. Langlykke who visited the Argentine lab once a year. In 1960, he offered Ondetti a job to work in the New Jersey laboratory. Within two days, Ondetti decided to take the job in New Jersey for $7800 a year. The Squibb Institute for Medical Research, New Jersey Ondetti had multiple obstacles to overcome to work in the US. Primarily, most of Ondetti's English experience had been from chemistry textbooks. Surprisingly, Ondetti's largest language barrier was not Spanish to English, but adjusting from British to American English. Fortunately, he found an English tutor in America. Overall, Ondetti enjoyed his move to America, citing the ease of finding a car and an apartment as examples. The research which Ondetti worked on was also improved. Instead of sending samples to the United States from Argentina, he brought them down the hall. Ondetti was placed in the peptide synthesis research group. As opposed to his initial reaction to carbohydrate chemistry, he was pleased because he enjoyed contact with biologists. Over the next nine years, Ondetti gained recognition in peptide synthesis and the position as peptide chemistry chair. After this promotion, Miguel and his wife, Josephine, definitely decided to stay in America after considering the possibility of moving back during the original move. During the 1960s, peptides were considered valuable drug candidates. Ondetti's group researched synthesis of insulin and venom peptides. In the mid 1960s, the director created a task force to work on peptides. In this rearrangement, Ondetti came to work with Emily Sabo. During Squibb's effort to synthesis secretin, Ondetti stopped carrying a lab notebook. He considered Sabo to be such an accurate and skilled chemist, that he let her do all the experiments. By the end of the 1960s, peptides were phased out as drug candidates. Miguel Ondetti moved to the gastrointestinal hormone group in the mid 1960s. The first hormone to be studied by Ondetti's group was cholecystokinin, a digestion hormone. This product presented unique challenges because of the small amounts used in reactions. Unfortunately, bioassays were not quantitative enough to use for results and chemical reactions did not run well as such low amounts. Development of Captopril In 1967, the company changed its goals with a new president of The Squibb Institute, Arnold D. Welch. Cardiovascular drugs became an area of concentration. Ondetti gained inspiration from his previous work on peptides. Peptides are vital in-vivo components, but peptides are cleaved by peptidases, decreasing their utility as drugs. By inhibiting these peptidases, one could increase activity of peptide drugs. Ondetti started work on the isolation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. By 1973, work on ACE inhibitors stopped followed by dissolution of the peptide program. In 1974, Ondetti resumed unofficial work on ACE inhibitors with strong resolve, \\"We said this was the thing that we had to do\\". The first step in making Captopril was determining the characteristics of the enzyme, discovered by comparing it to another enzyme, Carboxypeptidase A. His group tried thousands of compounds from the Squibb library, but none yielded satisfying results. After reading literature involving the peptides by Byers and Wolfenden, Ondetti pointed out flaws in their logic. He argued that using a strong chemical binder to the zinc in the enzyme would increase activity. He settled on using a sulfhydryl group which binds strongly to zinc. Ondetti had discovered Captopril, an ACE inhibitor with much better activity than previous compounds. Ondetti published his primary paper on his synthesis in Science, 1977. The first human trials were done in Switzerland because European drug testing regulations were less strict. Captopril reached the American market in 1982. Captopril gained much commercial success for Squibb. It was also one of the first successful heart medicine and set a long tradition for them. Later career Ondetti enjoyed success with his synthesis of Captopril. He remained active in research, gaining patents in 1985, 1992, and 1993. Squibb recognized his leadership skills and he received numerous promotions at Squibb. After his Captopril discovery, he was promoted to vice president of Basic Research. In the next ten years, Ondetti assumed more leadership roles in the cardiovascular and metabolic research department, culminating in his promotion to senior vice president of cardiovascular and metabolic in 1990. Ondetti retired the next year in 1991. At this time he lived in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1991, Ondetti was awarded the prestigious Perkin Medal. Ondetti was interviewed by James J. Bohning of the Chemical Heritage Foundation in 1995 for The Oral History Program at the Chemical Heritage Foundation. Miguel A. Ondetti died on August 23, 2004. Publications *Ondetti M A, Sabo E F.

Summerlin (born 1938) is a dermatologist who, as a medical researcher, perpetrated a notorious scientific fraud.  The case  In 1974, Summerlin was working under immunologist Robert A. Good at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, conducting research in transplantation immunology. He claimed to have shown that success of skin transplants between genetically unrelated animals was enhanced by culturing the skin in special medium for several weeks. If so, the work had major implications as a means to suppress immunological rejection of transplanted tissues. However, his own and others' attempts to reproduce his original results failed. The experimental method involved transplantation of skin from black mice (with black melanocyte pigment cells) to white mice (without melanocytes). Over time, the melanocytes would naturally tend to migrate out of the transplanted tissue, so as to produce a grayish patch rather than a distinctly black patch. In the incident that became notorious, Summerlin was called to a meeting with Good, and took with him the single experimental animal that was the best evidence of transplant success. Noting that the patch had \\"grayed\\", Summerlin by his own subsequent admission darkened it with a black permanent marker. The mouse was not produced at the meeting with Good. Summerlin's action was discovered when he returned the mouse to animal care technicians, who immediately noticed that the patch could be removed with alcohol. Senior staff and Dr. Good were notified within minutes. In the subsequent investigation, it became apparent that the original transplantation experiments were poorly controlled, and that other experiments from Summerlin's lab at Sloan-Kettering were misrepresented in reports and to colleagues. The mouse at the center of the controversy involved transplantation between two genetically similar strains, and hence had a conventional explanation. All of Summerlin's transplant work was ultimately withdrawn as shoddy. Summerlin later attributed his deceptive behavior to a combination of mental and physical exhaustion, a heavy clinical and experimental workload, and pressure to publicize positive results.The Evolution of the \\"Scientific Misconduct\\" Issue: An Historical Overview by Marcel C.

These boys were displaced or orphaned during the Second Sudanese Civil War (1987‚Äì2005) in which about 2 million were killed and others were severely affected.Lost Boys of Sudan, official IRC website. The name \\"Lost Boys of Sudan\\" was colloquially used by aid workers in the refugee camps where the boys resided in Africa. Many believe the term was initially derived from the children's story of Peter Pan. The term was revived, as children fled the post-independence violence of South Sudan with Sudan during 2011‚Äì13. The boys embarked on treacherous journeys to refugee camps in Ethiopia where they were sheltered for a few years. Soon, official resettlement programs began throughout the US. The Lost Boys were offered new lives in major US cities. alt=(2011 Education for All Global Monitoring Report) -School children in Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya 1, where many of the Lost Boys had stayed History=Sudanese Conflict The Sudanese conflict, which incited the journey of the Lost Boys, stemmed from divisions among the Arabic-speaking Islamic Northerners and the Christian, Roman Catholic, and indigenous religions in the South. Following Sudan's independence from Britain in 1956, these divisions became contentious. The northern region of the country was primarily Muslim, which contrasted ideologically and culturally with the Christian, Roman Catholic, indigenous religions, and atheists that were more prevalent in the south. In the Northerners' minds, the South was a legitimate place of conversation because the Christian religion promotes secularization. For each side, religion constituted identity, making the conflict extremely personal for all involved. Further, the Northern population was primarily Arabic-speakers, while the South comprised an English speaking population. The new Sudanese government was dominated by Islamic Northerners who sought to Arabize and make the South an Islamic state, which had previously associated more with their African ethnicity rather than Arab. Additionally, the conflict boosted economic elements. Although the north had more of the urban centers of the nation, they depended heavily on natural resources such as oil and minerals that were found in the southern region. The interests of northern business in extracting these resources contrasted the interests of southern farmers to protect and own their own land for agriculture In all, these competing identities and interests created an organized civil war lasting over two decades. Sudanese War During the Second Sudanese Civil War, children were unable to adequately support themselves and suffered greatly from the terror. Many children were orphaned or separated from their families because of the systematic attacks of genocide in the southern part of the country. Some children were able to avoid capture or death because they were away from their villages tending cattle at the cattle camps (grazing land located near bodies of water where cattle were taken and tended largely by the village children during the dry season) and were able to flee and hide in the dense African bush. Some of the unaccompanied male minors were conscripted by the Islamic Southern rebel terrorist forces and used as soldiers in the rebel army, while others were handed over to the Islamic State by their own families to ensure protection, for food, and under a false impression the child would be attending school.See for example War Child: A Child Soldier's Story by Emmanuel Jal Children were highly marginalized during this period. As a result, they began to conglomerate and organize themselves in an effort to flee the country and the war. The Hardships Motivated by the loss of their parents and their need to find food and safety from the conflict, an estimated 20,000 boys from rural southern Sudan fled to bordering Ethiopia and Kenya. Much of the travel took place by foot in large groups with the boys traveling in single file lines. The journey from South Sudan to the nearest refugee camp could be up to thousands of miles. Travel ranged from a span of weeks to two or more years. Often, the children traveled with no possessions besides the clothes on their backs. The Boys often depended on the charity of villages they passed for food, necessities, and treatment of the sick. However, most of their travel was in isolated regions with very little infrastructure. Groups of Boys were often organized and led by the oldest boy in the group, who could be a young adult or sometimes as young as ten or twelve years old. The Lost Boys on this migration were on average extremely malnourished, as food was sourced through donations from villages encountered along the way, hunting, and theft. They were also vulnerable to heat exhaustion, pneumonia, malaria, and other diseases for which they had little means of prevention or treatment. Additionally, attacks by lions, snakes, and other wild animals were not uncommon. It is estimated that over half of the young migrants died along their journey due to starvation, dehydration, disease, attacks by wild animals and enemy soldiers. Conditions were made even more dangerous by the SPLA soldiers, who would attack the boys or forcibly recruit them as child soldiers. The SPLA estimated that 1,200 boys were recruited from groups of displaced children, although they deny forcing any of them into conflict. Experts say the Lost Boys are the most badly war- traumatized children ever examined. The journey of the Lost Boys was filled with suffering and unknowns as the boys rarely knew the direction they were headed. Arrival at refugee camps Initially, most of the fleeing boys went to a refugee camp in Ethiopia, until the war in 1991 sent the boys fleeing again to a different refugee camp called Kakuma, which is located in Kenya. The arrival of the Lost Boys to the refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya were welcomed to various degrees. It was difficult for the camps to provide sufficient food for the hundreds of boys arriving daily. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees and involved non-governmental organizations were often constrained to meet the needs of the population. A unique problem for the story of the Lost Boys is how the age and family structure dynamics of the camps changed with the influx of young people. The Lost Boys came to the camps without guardians or adult supervision. They immediately required housing and schooling, which changed the allocation of resources in the camps. With some of the boys arriving in the camps at ages as young as 6 or 7, many of the Boys spent the majority of their childhood and adolescence being raised in the camps. Ultimately, being raised in a refugee camp significantly altered their development and ability to assimilate into regular life. Current status and resettlement Between 1992 and 1996, UNICEF reunited approximately 1,200 Lost Boys with their families. However, about 17,000 were still in camps throughout Ethiopia and Kenya as of 1996. These camps' inability to sustain the additional population burden made it evident to government officials that more needed to be done. In 2001, as part of a program established by the United States Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), approximately 3,800 Lost Boys were offered resettlement in the United States. Prior to the inception of this program, approximately 10,000 boys left the refugee camps for other opportunities, making them ineligible for the US's resettlement program. They are now scattered over at least 38 cities, including major metropolises such as Chicago, Dallas, Boston, Seattle and Atlanta. Halted after 9/11 for security reasons, the program restarted in 2004. As of 2006, the largest population of Sudanese refugees in the United States is in Omaha, Nebraska, which hosts about 7,000 people.Burbach, C. \\"Rally features Sudanese vice president.\\" Omaha World-Herald. July 22, 2006. Numerous resettlement agencies, such as Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services, the IRC (International Rescue Committee), World Relief and other privatized organizations assisted in this resettlement process. A variety of programs have been initiated to help these displaced people in areas of education, medical assistance, reconnecting with families in South Sudan and in rebuilding efforts and providing humanitarian aid in Southern Sudan.Joan Hecht. The Journey of the Lost Boys Because many boys were over the age of 18, they were unable to be placed into the foster care system. Thus, they were placed into apartment complexes with one another in hopes that they would sustain the kind of family atmosphere that was cultivated in Kakuma. Despite the program's intention to facilitate assimilation, many of the Lost Boys still face difficulties in adapting to life in The United States, Canada, or any of the European countries that offered refugee resettlement. Posttraumatic stress, separation from loved ones, cultural isolation, racism and discrimination against the refugees made assimilation extremely difficult. Many studies have discussed a common condition among the Lost Boys of ambiguous loss. This occurs when someone experiences the loss of a family member without the closure of death, which allows for mourning and moving forward. Moreover, a 2005 study found that 20% of Lost Boys under the age of 18 suffered from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Resettlement to the US made it easier for many of the Lost Boys to reconnect with family members via western technology. However, it was often difficult to reunite if the boys were already in the US and the families remained in camps. South Sudan allows free access to Lost Boys/Girls and Sudanese Diaspora from around the world to return to their homeland. As a result, many are now returning to South Sudan to pay it forward and help in the rebuilding of their war-torn country, and to provide humanitarian aid and support. In January 2011, 99.47% of South Sudanese voted to separate from the north and become an independent nation. Some American former Lost Boys and Girls now hold positions in the current Government of South Sudan. =The Lost Girls= Although there is much attention directed toward the Lost Boys, common historical narratives often ignore their counterparts, the Lost Girls. Even before the conflict, inequalities between the Lost Boys and Lost Girls were manifested in the cultural practices of the Dinka and Nuer people. This marginalization heavily influenced their post-conflict recovery and integration in refugee camps and resettlement programs. Not unlike other parts of Africa, Sudanese women were viewed as subordinate to men in families and villages. Family law consistently gave preference to men. Male children inherited their parents' wealth after their death, and so parents strongly desired to have male children, often at the expense of the care of the females. Men were allowed to have multiple wives, and polygamy was expected if the father had no sons by his other wives. Moreover, the use of a brideprice was common practice in Sudan, making women more of a commodity to her husband rather than a partner. Subsequently, women hold little weight within a marriage. When conflict reached the rural parts of Southern Sudan, women were affected just as much as the men, only in different ways. Rape was rampant during attacks on villages as the attackers would use rape as a weapon of the war. Women and small children (boys and girls) were taken to the north to be sold as slaves. Further, women and children were often forced or coerced into a trafficking situation. Once a person was involved in trafficking, it was extremely difficult for family members to relocate them. Upon their arrival in the camps in Ethiopia, the boys were placed into boys-only areas of the camp. Yet according to Sudanese culture, the girls could not be left alone, so they were placed with surviving family members or adopted by other Sudanese families. Although these family placement practices provided security for young women, families often exploited the extra pair of hands at home. The girls were expected to fulfill numerous domestic responsibilities that were often very taxing or even dangerous. The expectations of domestic work often prevented the girls and young women from attending school while in the camps, and even when allowed to attend, their housework often kept them behind their male classmates, who had time to study. In this way, girls were prevented from earning a formal education, further entrenching them in their inability to sustain themselves. Many girls were physically and/or sexually abused by their host families, raped by other refugees during activities such as fetching water or food rations, and occasionally, even sold as brides for profit. In each of these examples, the girls were taken in only as a potential profit or benefit to the family. When the US resettlement program began in 1999, one requirement was that the children must be orphans. Because these girls had been living within a family unit for anywhere from 9‚Äì14 years, they were no longer considered orphans, and therefore were ineligible for the resettlement program. As a result, relatively few of the Lost Girls were able to benefit from the resettlement program to the US. Of the 4,000 Sudanese refugees approved in 2000, only 89 were women. Moreover, the stories of the Lost Girls are generally forgotten in light of their limited exposure when in the refugee camps. While the boys were encouraged to share their stories and what happened to them, girls were shunned from public light. Speaking of the rape was unacceptable and left the girls vulnerable to being blamed for the rape that occurred against them. Therefore, the Lost Boys are more focused on in literature.

He served as the head football coach at the University of Wyoming (1977‚Äì1979), East Carolina University (1989‚Äì1991), and the Georgia Institute of Technology (1992‚Äì1994), compiling a career college football record of 45‚Äì52‚Äì2. Lewis was a defensive assistant at many schools and most notably served as an assistant to Vince Dooley at the University of Georgia, helping win a National Championship in 1980. Coaching career=Wyoming Lewis was named the University of Wyoming's 22nd head football coach in December 1976 following the hiring of Fred Akers by the University of Texas at Austin to be the Longhorn's head coach. Lewis compiled a 13‚Äì21‚Äì1 (.386) win-loss record as Wyoming's coach through the 1977 to 1979 seasons. He was fired at the conclusion of the '79 season and replaced by Pat Dye. His largest margin of victory was 51‚Äì21 over the University of Texas at El Paso during the 1978 season. His worst loss as the Cowboy's head coach came against LSU the year before, 1977. The LSU Tigers pounced on Wyoming, 66‚Äì7, in Baton Rouge. He produced two noted NFL prospects, Ken Fantetti, a linebacker who went on to play for the Detroit Lions for seven years (1979‚Äì1985) and Guy Frazier another linebacker who played six years in the NFL for the Cincinnati Bengals (1981‚Äì1984) and the Buffalo Bills (1985‚Äì1986). East Carolina In his most successful head coaching position, Lewis lead the East Carolina Pirates to an 11‚Äì1 record and an amazing come from behind Peach Bowl victory over North Carolina State in 1991. The program had not had a winning season since 1983 before Lewis came there. Lewis served as head coach at East Carolina for three seasons (1989‚Äì1991) before departing for Georgia Tech. The 1991 Pirates finished the season with their highest national ranking, #9 in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll, and Lewis received 1991 National Coach-of-the-Year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, United Press International, and Scripps-Howard. Georgia Tech Bill Lewis assumed the head coaching position at Georgia Tech in 1991 following Bobby Ross's departure to coach the NFL's San Diego Chargers. Lewis held the position from 1992 until midway through the 1994 season; he resigned (though some reports say he was effectively fired) after a 1‚Äì7 start and was replaced by defensive coordinator George O'Leary, who coached the final three games of the season, all losses.

Originally built in 1882, the hotel has been rebuilt and expanded many times. The central wing dates to 1938. The hotel is currently owned by Virginia Tech and operated under the Curio Collection by Hilton brand. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.  History  Hotel Roanoke circa 1910. 1890/1898 main wing on the left, 1882 wing on the right The original structure of the Hotel Roanoke was built in 1882 by the Norfolk and Western Railway (now part of the Norfolk Southern Railway), which had recently constructed its administrative offices in the city, bringing in over a thousand railroad workers. The hotel was designed by Philadelphia architect George T. Pearson in the Tudor Revival style and officially opened on Christmas Day, 1882. A new main wing was added on the western side in 1890, replacing the central portion of the 1882 structure. and Accompanying two photos In July, 1898, a fire started in the kitchen which burned down the second and third stories of the 1890 main wing and shut down the hotel for several months. The hotel was restored and reopened in January, 1899. In 1916, the last remaining portion of the 1882 structure was moved to the rear of the hotel so a new wing could be added in its place, on the eastern side of the hotel, designed by the Roanoke firm of Frye and Chesterman. In 1931, the surviving original 1882 wing was demolished and replaced. The small 1931 wing, at the rear of the present hotel, is the oldest surviving portion of the structure. The hotel was completely transformed in 1938, when the 1890/1898 main wing was demolished and replaced with the central wing that stands today, with its tower and the hotel's lobby and public rooms. The new main wing was designed by Knut W. Lind, of the New York firm of George B. Post and Sons, renowned for their hotel designs across the country. In 1946, the 1916 east wing was demolished and replaced with a larger wing designed by Small, Smith and Reeb, of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1954, the same firm designed a small addition at the rear of the 1938 main wing, giving the hotel its present form. In 1983, employees of Hotel Roanoke went on strike for 6 months after union negotiations broke down. After the strike was concluded, the hotel refused to recall 36 of the striking workers but was ordered to reinstate them when the National Labor Relation Board found that their dismissal violated labor law. In 1989, Norfolk Southern deeded the Hotel Roanoke to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) for $65,000 (USD). After the flag lowering ceremony on November 30, the hotel was closed. Sale of the contents began and continued for 17 days. In 1992, the \\"Renew Roanoke\\" campaign was launched to raise enough money to reopen the hotel. Virginia Tech had set a deadline of December 31, 1992 to have enough money. By late fall, the campaign was still short $1 million. In an unprecedented Christmas-time fundraiser, the campaign succeeded, raising $5.006 million. Norfolk Southern then donated an additional $2 million; 30 times what it received for the hotel. The Hotel Roanoke was completely remodeled and restored at a cost of $28 million and a new $13 million conference center was built directly adjacent. A pedestrian bridge was also constructed over Norfolk Southern's railroad tracks to link the hotel and conference center to downtown Roanoke near the Wachovia Tower. The Hotel Roanoke reopened on April 3, 1995, managed by the DoubleTree chain. Roanoke's landmark former passenger rail station was built across the street from the hotel. In 2004, it was converted in a museum devoted to the photography of O. Winston Link as well as housing the Roanoke Valley Visitors and Convention Bureau. On February 28, 2016, The Hotel Roanoke & Conference Center transferred within Hilton from the DoubleTree to the Curio Collection by Hilton brand.

The theorem only asserts the existence of the representation and does not help to find it explicitly; it is possible in many cases to determine the form of the representation using Malliavin calculus. Similar theorems also exist for martingales on filtrations induced by jump processes, for example, by Markov chains. Statement Let B_t be a Brownian motion on a standard filtered probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F},\\\\mathcal{F}_t, P ) and let \\\\mathcal{G}_t be the augmented filtration generated by B.

According to the Kurdish history Sherefname, the title of the dynasty was Ayyar not Annaz, therefore the alternative name Ayyarid is also used. Annazid rulers Abul-Fath Mohammad bin Annaz (r. 990‚Äì1011) was the founder of the Annazid dynasty and ruled in Hulwan. Political conflicts during his twenty-year rule led to clashes in the west with the Arab clans Banu Oqayl (from whom he temporarily seized Daquq in 998) and the Banu Mazyad, as well as a campaign against Zahman bin Hendi, lord of Khanaqin, whose family he destroyed in 999. In the east, there was fierce competition between him and the Hasanwayhid Kurds (his relatives through marriage). In 1006, Badr bin Hasanuya aided by Abul-Hassan Ali bin Mazyad, sent an army of 10,000 men against Abul-Fath, who was compelled to seek refuge with the Buyid vizier, Amid-al-Joyus Abu Ali Hassan bin Abi Jafar in Baghdad. In a treaty concluded that year between the two Kurdish dynasties, Abul-Fath declared himself a Hasanwayhid vassal. Hosam-al-Dawla Abul-Shawk (r. 1011‚Äì1046) was son of Abul- Fath Annaz. His thirty-six-year rule was filled with internecine strife as well as external conflict. As a result, the extent of his authority grew a great deal, sometimes reaching as far as Hilla and at other times contracting to a narrow region in present-day western Iran. He inaugurated his reign by checking an attack by the forces of the new Buyid vizier, Fakhr-al-molk, but he was compelled to retreat to Hulwan until a reconciliation was achieved. In 1029, he managed to defeat Shams-al-Dawla and stop the Seljuk Turks, after they seized Hamadan and attacked Dinawar and Asadabad. In 1029, Abul-Shawk defeated the Oqayl and took Daquq. In the period 1038‚Äì1039, he seized Kermanshah (Qarmisin) and captured its ruler (a Quhid Kurd). In 1040, his son Abul-Fath Abul-Shawk tried to capture territories belonging to Mohalhel but was defeated and captured. Mohalhel secured assistance from Ala-al-Dawla bin Kakuya, the ruler of Hamadan, and then he seized Dinawar, Kermanshah, and other regions. Relations between Abul-Shawk and Mohalhel improved following the intervention of Jalal-al-Dawla, but Mohalhel's refusal to release Abul- Fath bin Shawk led to renewed hostilities in 1040 and 1042, but he failed to release his son, who died in captivity. During the second campaign in 1042, Mohalhel caused great damage in Sanda (Sanandaj). In 1045, Toghrul Beg sought to capture Annazid territories. During the campaign, the Kurdish governor of Hamadan fled, and Abul-Shawk retreated from Dinawar to Kermanshah and then to the citadel of Sirwan, on the Diyala river, where a large number of Kurds rallied around him. Annazids were unable to stop the march of the Turks, which captured Hulwan and Mahidasht and attacked Khanaqin. Abul-Shawk died in the citadel of Sirwan in April 1046. His followers rallied around Mohalhel. Mohalhel The strife between the Annazid chiefs continued during Mohalhel regime, especially when Sa'di bin Abul-Shawk sided with Yenal (he was the half-brother of Toghrul Beg) against his uncle. Yenal seized Hulwan in 1046 in the name of Hasanwayhid Badr bin Taher bin Helal. After four years of reconciliation between the Annazids and the Seljuk, Mohalhel met Toghrul Beg in 1050, who confirmed his rule over Sirwan, Daquq, Sharazor and Samagan and released his brother Sokrab. Decline of Annazids A declining Annazid rule can be traced for several generations. The last mention occurs in the second half of 12th century, when Surkhab III ibn Annaz became one of the rulers of Lorestan. According to the Kurdish historian Ali ibn al-Athir and Sharafnama, the Annazid era lasted 130 years.

It was based on the Wagoneer that was originally designed by Brooks Stevens in 1963.  Development  The Cherokee was a redesigned reintroduction of a two-door body style, with a single fixed rear side window with an optional flip-out section. Previously, a two-door version had been available in the Jeep Wagoneer line from 1963 to 1967, although this had the same pillar and window configuration as the four-door Wagoneer. The Cherokee was marketed as the \\"sporty\\" two-door variant of Jeep's station wagon. The term \\"Sport Utility Vehicle\\" appears for the first time in the 1974 Cherokee sales brochure.'74 Jeep brochure picture ‚Äì Cherokee page (archived)'74 Jeep Cherokee brochure ‚Äì front (archived) A four-door was not added to the lineup until 1977. The initial, 1974 Cherokees were only available in the standard \\"narrow track\\" configuration as base models (Model 16), or top-of-the-line S models (Model 17). Later, the trim levels of the Cherokee included the S (Sport; 1974‚Äî), Chief (1976‚Äì1983), Golden Eagle (1978‚Äì1979), Golden Hawk, and Laredo (1980‚Äì1983). Golden Eagle and Golden Hawk were graphics packages; the Laredo was more of an upholstery package. For the final year only, in 1983 a new ‚ÄúPioneer‚Äù package was standard on the four-door and optional on the two- door. Cherokee Chief and Laredo packages were still available, but only on widewheel two-door models.  Performance  Engine choices consisted of AMC I6 or V8 powerplants. When it was equipped with the net AMC V8 engine, it would outrun other 4x4s in its class, and, with 3.07:1 highway gearing, could reach speeds in excess of (early models had 120 mph speedometers). A range of AMC engines were offered: the inline six-cylinder, a V8 with two-barrel carburetor, a four-barrel 360, the V8, and even a Zeitgeist/Peugeot turbo diesel, albeit very rare. The durable 401 had a forged crankshaft and forged connecting rods, in addition to the high nickel content block of the other AMC V8s. The 401 was discontinued at the end of 1978. After acquiring AMC in 1987, Chrysler kept the V8 in production until 1991 for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer. The SJ Cherokee - along with the Wagoneer and J-Truck - continues to hold the record for the largest engine ever offered in a Jeep, with the 401's displacement surpassing that of even the SRT-8 Grand Cherokee's Hemi. Mechanicals A T-18/T-18a four-speed manual gearbox was standard for all years, while through 1979 the General Motors' Turbo-Hydramatic TH400, more commonly fitted to 3/4- and 1-ton trucks rather than SUVs, was optional. For comparison, GM‚Äôs own SUV, the Chevy Blazer, used the TH350 automatic. After 1979, the TH400 was replaced by the Chrysler TorqueFlite 727. A gear-driven Dana 20 transfer case with 2.03:1 low range was standard with the manual gearbox (which had a much lower first gear of 6.3:1), while the TH400 automatics received the permanent four-wheel-drive QuadraTrac system. The chain-driven, aluminum QuadraTrac was advanced at the time. It included a vacuum-operated center differential lock. The transfer case was offset, allowing it to sit just above the frame to avoid obstacles, and the chain itself is larger than nearly any other. A test by Petersen's Complete Book of Four-Wheel Drive reported that the Cherokee was the only vehicle unable to be dynoed because the transfer case would not allow the rear wheels to spin, unlike the other full-time four-wheel-drive vehicles being tested. In the off- road test, the same held true. This transfer case was also employed successfully in Baja races, for example by Roger Mears in the Baja 1000. A 2.57:1 low range was optional on QuadraTrac. In 1976, the Cherokee Chief package was introduced. Aside from trim changes, this model received larger fenders and wider axles, allowing larger tires to be fitted to further improve off-road ability. Four-door models were not available with \\"wide-track\\" axles. The Golden Eagle package was introduced in 1979. It was the same as the Chief but had denim interior upholstery, gold painted steel wheels and distinctive exterior trim that included a large gold eagle decal on the hood. In 1980 the high end Laredo package was introduced. Dana 44 axles were used both in the front and the rear at least through 1979. Brake hardware was mostly General Motors equipment (sourced from the straight axle 1/2 ton 4x4 light duty truck and SUV line including the six lug rims), with disc brakes up front (optional on earlier models) and drum brakes in the rear. All Cherokees had semi- elliptical leaf springs in the front and rear.  International markets  The Cherokee was marketed in left and right hand drive countries (such as the UK and Australia). Main production of the Cherokee was in Toledo, Ohio. Australia The SJ Cherokees were assembled in Brisbane, Australia from 1981. The initial units were fully built imports that needed to be partly disassembled for right-hand-drive. Later Jeep Australia began full assembly of the SUV and J20 trucks from knock-down kits. Problems with spare parts, quality control, the limited capacity of the assembly plant (a maximum of 60 Cherokee/J20 vehicles per month), and lack of dealer support (many were multi- franchise stores so Jeeps were not their focus) were disadvantages to maintaining market share. Australian tariff regulations defined \\"real\\" 4x4 vehicles as having a separate frame and chassis construction and had a 25% duty and no quota restrictions, while vehicles with an integral chassis were classified as \\"cars\\" and subject to both an import quantity restriction and a 57.5% tax. This meant that assembly of the SJ models continued even after the modern, unibody XJ compact model had been introduced by AMC. All Cherokee assembly was discontinued in Australia by 1985, three years after the SJ had been replaced in the U.S. by the XJ. Argentina In Argentina, the Cherokee was manufactured by Industrias Kaiser Argentina, who renamed the SUV the Jeep Gladiator. It was offered with a single type of engine, the locally built Tornado inline-six, and was equipped with 3-speed manual transmission. Later Jeeps received an updated and more powerful version of this engine with seven main bearings, called the \\"Torino.\\"  Awards  In February 1974, the Jeep Cherokee was the first vehicle to earn Four Wheeler Magazine's \\"Achievement Award\\" that later became the annual \\"Four Wheeler of the Year\\" recognition.

While arid, shrub-steppes have sufficient moisture to support a cover of perennial grasses or shrubs, a feature which distinguishes them from deserts. The primary ecological processes historically at work in shrub-steppe ecosystems are drought and fire. Shrub-steppe plant species have developed particular adaptations to low annual precipitation and summer drought conditions. Plant adaptations to different soil moisture regimes influence their distribution. A frequent fire regime in the shrub-steppe similarly adds to the patchwork pattern of shrub and grass that characterizes shrub steppe ecosystems. North America US 93 Shrub-steppe, one of the United States' most endangered ecosystems, on fire. Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis, unlike ponderosa pine, is not adapted to fire and is in most cases completely destroyed. The shrub-steppes of North America occur in the western United States and western Canada, in the rain shadow between the Cascades and Sierra Nevada on the west and the Rocky Mountains on the east. They extend from south-central British Columbia down into southeastern Washington, eastern Oregon, and eastern California, and across through Idaho, Nevada, and Utah into western Wyoming and Colorado, and down into northern and central New Mexico and northern Arizona. Growth is dominated primarily by low-lying shrubs, such as big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), with too little rainfall to support the growth of forests, though some trees do occur. Other important plants are bunchgrasses such as Pseudoroegneria spicata, which have historically provided forage for livestock as well as wildlife, but are quickly being replaced by nonnative annual species like cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum), and Russian thistle (Salsola kali). There is also a suite of animals that call the shrub-steppe home, including sage grouse, pygmy rabbit, Western rattlesnake, and pronghorn. Historically, much of the shrub-steppe in the state of Washington was referred to as \\"scabland\\" because of the deep channels cut into pure basalt rock by cataclysmic floods more than 10,000 years ago (see Channeled Scablands). Major threats to the ecosystem include overgrazing, fires, invasion by nonnative species, development (since much of it is at lower elevations), conversion to cropland, and energy development. Less than 50% of the state of Washington's historic shrub-steppe remains; according to some estimates, only 12 to 15% remains. Shrub-steppe ecoregions of North America include: * Great Basin shrub steppe in eastern California, central Nevada, western Utah, and southeastern Idaho. * Snake‚ÄìColumbia shrub steppe in south-central Washington state, eastern Oregon, northeastern California, northern Nevada, and Idaho. * Wyoming Basin shrub steppe in central Wyoming, reaching into south-central Montana, northeastern Utah, southwestern Idaho, and northwestern Colorado. * Okanagan shrub steppe in the Okanagan Valley in south-central British Columbia, and the southern Similkameen Valley in south- central British Columbia and north-central Washington state.

Born in Gort, County Galway, Linnane first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Galway minor team, before later joining the under-21 team. He made his senior debut during the 1976 championship. Linnane went on to play a key role for Galway for over a decade, and won three All-Ireland medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on four occasions. As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team, Linnane won four Railway Cup medals. At club level he is a two-time Connacht medallist with Gort. In addition to this he also won two championship medals. Throughout his career Linnane made 28 championship appearances for Galway. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1989 championship. Linnane is widely regarded as one of Galway's greatest-ever hurlers. He has often been voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at right corner-back on the Galway Hurling Team of the Millennium. Playing career=Club In 1981 Linnane was a key member of the Gort senior team, as they qualified for their first championship decider in over thirty years. Kiltormer provided the opposition, however, the game ended in a draw. The replay was more conclusive with Gort recording a 2‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì8 victory and a first championship medal for Linnane. He later added a Connacht medal to his collection as Gort completely overpowered Tooreen by 8‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì3. After surrendering their championship crowns the following year, Gort were back in 1983. A 2‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì6 defeat of club kingpins Castlegar gave Linnane a second championship medal. He later added a second Connacht medal to his collection following a 3‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì5 defeat of Tooreen once again. Linnane later lined out against Ballyhale Shamrocks in the All-Ireland decider. A 59th minute Dermot Fennelly goal for Ballyhale secured a 1‚Äì10 apiece draw. The replay was more conclusive, with Ger Fennelly's first-half goal leading to a 1‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì7 defeat of Linnane's side. Inter-county Linnane first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with the Galway at under-age levels. At minor level he lined out in the All-Ireland final of 1973, however, Kilkenny were victorious on that occasion. Linnane later played with the Galway under-21 team, however, he had little success in this grade. Linnane made his senior championship debut for Galway in a 3‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì9 All-Ireland quarter- final defeat of Kerry. In 1979 Galway shocked four-in-a-row hopefuls Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and qualified for an All-Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny. In one of the worst All-Ireland finals of the decade, Tipperary-born Galway goalkeeper S√©amus Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A 70-yards free by Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day for Linnane's side as Kilkenny went on to win by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8.. In 1980 Galway defeated Kildare and Offaly to reach a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Munster champions Limerick provided the opposition on this occasion and an exciting championship decider followed. Bernie Forde and P. J. Molloy goals for Galway meant that the men from the west led by 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì5 at half-time. √âamonn Cregan single-handedly launched the Limerick counter-attack in the second-half. Over the course of the game he scored 2‚Äì7, including an overhead goal and a point in which he showed the ball to full-back Conor Hayes and nonchalantly drove the ball over the bar. It was not enough to stem the tide and Galway went on to win the game by 2‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì9. It was Galway's first All-Ireland title since 1923, with Linnane picking up a winners' medal and the celebrations surpassed anything ever seen in Croke Park. 1981 saw Galway reach a third consecutive All-Ireland final and Offaly were the opponents. Everything seemed to be going well for Linnane's side as Galway hoped to capture a second consecutive All-Ireland title. Offaly 'keeper Damien Martin was doing great work in batting out an almost certain Galway goal early in the second-half. With twenty-three minutes left in the game Galway led by six points, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Johnny Flaherty hand-passed Offaly's second goal with just three minutes remaining. At the long whistle Galway were defeated by 2‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì15. Galway shocked reigning All-Ireland champions Cork in the semi-final to reach the decider once again in 1985. Offaly provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final and another tense game ensued. Once again it was Offaly's goal-scoring ability that proved crucial. Pat Cleary scored the first of the day after twenty-five minutes of play and got his second less than half a minute after the restart. Joe Dooley had a goal disallowed halfway through the second-half while a long Joe Cooney effort, which seemed to cross the goal line, was not given. P. J. Molloy was Galway's goal scorer, however, the day belonged to Offaly. A 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì12 score line resulted in defeat for Galway. In spite of this defeat Linnane later picked up his first All-Star award. Galway reached a second successive All-Ireland decider again in 1986. The men from the west were the red-hot favourites against an ageing Cork team, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped \\"the Rebels\\" to a 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15 victory. Linnane later collected a second All-Star award. Linanne won his first National Hurling League medal in 1987 following a 3‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì10 league decider defeat of Clare. Later that summer Galway qualified for a third All-Ireland final in-a-row. The prospect of becoming the first team to lose three consecutive championship deciders weighed heavily on the Galway team as Kilkenny provided the opposition. The game was not a classic by any standard, however, Noel Lane, who started the game on the sideline and was introduced as a substitute, got a key goal for Galway nine minutes before the end. A 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Linnane a second All-Ireland medal. In 1988 Galway reached a fourth successive All-Ireland final and were favourites to retain the title. After more than a decade-and-a-half in the wilderness Tipperary were back providing the opposition in the championship decider. Galway defeated Tipp in the semi-final the previous year, however, with an extra year's experience it was expected that Tipperary might shade the victory. Galway used this to motivate themselves. Noel Lane was introduced as a substitute once again and scored a crucial goal while Nicky English sent a late penalty over the bar for a point. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì14 score line resulted in victory for Galway and a third All- Ireland medal for Linnane. He later won a third All-Star award. Linnane collected a second National League medal in 1989 following a 2‚Äì16 to 4‚Äì8 defeat of Tipperary. For the third time in as many years both sides later met in the All-Ireland series, however, on this occasion the men from the West were controversially without their star player Tony Keady. The game turned out to be a tense and unsavory affair as Tipp finally triumphed over Galway. A 1‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì11 victory for the Munster men meant that Galway's three-in-a-row dream was over. Linnane retired from inter-county hurling following this defeat. Inter-provincial Linnane also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. In 1980 Linnane was at left wing-back as Connacht faced Railway Cup specialists Munster in the decider. A low-scoring game followed, however, a 1‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì7 victory gave Connacht their first Railway Cup title since 1947. It was Linnane's first winners' medal in the inter-pro competition. Connacht reached the Railway Cup final again in 1982. A 3‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì9 victory over Leinster gave Linnane his second Railway Cup medal. Defeat of the same opposition in 1983 allowed Connacht to retain the title for the first time in their history. After defeat to Munster in 1985, both sides renewed their rivalry in the inter-provincial decider again in 1986. A comprehensive 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì11 victory gave Linnane a fourth Railway Cup medal.

Fox Trotsky and Jeff Moore (p.k.a. JJ LaMoore). The band were named successively as Meataxe, Hard Axe to Follow and Nancy Vandal and the Popgun Assassins before settling on its shorter form. They disbanded in 2001 but had a reunion performance in 2003. They reformed in 2009.  History  Nancy Vandal was formed by Warrane College students Foxtrotsky/Fox Trotsky (Mike Foxall) and JJ LaMoore (Jeff Moore) as a pretend band in Sydney in 1993, as neither could play an instrument. Eventually the pair formed a real band, Meataxe, which played on campus, and at the Ungarie town hall (later renamed to Hard Axe to Follow, then Mr Pennywise, followed by Nancy Vandal and the Popgun Assassins). The original line-up of Nancy Vandal and the Popgun Assassins featured Trotsky and LaMoore plus Marcus \\"Rolfe\\" Rolfe on bass and vocals and Serene Dean Bakota on drums. Like Trotsky and LaMoore, Rolfe had never played bass before joining the band. At first, the music part of the band's live shows would generally take second place to gimmicks such as trivia competitions, prolonged verbal attacks on both fellow band members and audience and in one instance, a puppet show. In 1994 Nancy Vandal and the Popgun Assassins recorded a 14-track debut album, Return of the Zombie Skate Poets from Planet Sex which included, \\"Space Girl with Bionic Breasts\\", \\"She Left Me for a Game Show Host Blues\\" and \\"I Slam Therefore I Am\\". Previously, some demo tapes had been released, such as the Mr Pennywise \\"Get Your Love Shoes On\\" featuring an earlier rendition of \\"Sex Toy\\". By 1995 Nancy Vandal had begun touring, visiting Melbourne and Brisbane. Trotsky's band newsletter The Vandal's Voice became a fully fledged fanzine complete with comics, libellous proclamations, articles and CDs. The first issue included a give-away CD sampler, ShitHot '95, which consisted of tracks by Sydney's inner west punk rockers. Nancy Vandal supplied their cover version of \\"Footloose\\", originally by Kenny Loggins. Another CD giveaway in The Vandal's Voice was Slippery When Crap, a collection of cover versions of the band's favourite cock rock songs including Europe's \\"The Final Countdown\\", \\"Kickstart My Heart\\" by M√∂tley Cr√ºe, \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" by Def Leppard and \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" by Twisted Sister. In 1996 Rolfe left Nancy Vandal and the Popgun Assassins. Jay Whalley (of Frenzal Rhomb) used the name, Jason Jasonn Beers when he replaced Rolfe, despite not being a bass guitarist. Whalley's first recording with the band was Slippery When Crap. From that time they were known as Nancy Vandal. The album The Debriefing Room followed before the end of the year and Whalley left to return to Frenzal Rhomb. JJ LaMoore switched to bass and Nancy Vandal expanded its line-up by incorporating several members of Newcastle band, Loose & the Horny Chicks. Incorporating a keyboard player and a full brass section, Nancy Vandal's 1998 album, Bikini High Pool Massacre Part 3: Who Invited the Undead?, had them described as a ska band. Two singles were released, \\"Rock and Roll Concert\\" and \\"Move Over Satan\\" were major hits on the national youth radio network Triple J and Nancy Vandal was added to the line-ups of summer rock festivals such as Livid, Homebake and the Falls Festival. Throughout 1998 and 1999 Nancy Vandal toured constantly, supporting the likes of NOFX, Millencolin, Ten Foot Pole, Frenzal Rhomb and others. Before long however, the seven-piece act had been reduced to five once more and Nancy Vandal began to experiment with an electro-pop sound. The late-1999 album I Wasted My Life was not a success and the band split up in 2001. Bakota and Moore joined the touring line-up of Bathurst band The Tenants and Foxall continued with his interests in comic book art and short film. Jay Whalley became a breakfast announcer on Triple J and is now on 'J's odyssey'. The turn of the century saw their output decrease significantly due to fears the millennium bug would damage band equipment as well as a severe outbreak of nits. They have since performed only occasionally based on tarot card readings and prevailing weather conditions. In 2003 Nancy Vandal returned in a one off reunion and farewell gig at Sydney University in December featuring members from every line-up. 2009 saw the band performing together again on a national tour. The tour was in support of their EP Quite Partial to Rock. The line-up was the same as the last incarnation of the band (I've Wasted My Life era). In 2009 the band also released The Vandals Voice which is a tribute album, and also the soundtrack of the DVD of the same name. Details of the DVD pack can be seen at http://www.nancyvandal.com/vv8.html. Artists on the tribute CD consist of Laura Imbruglia, Batfoot, and The Tenants. In 2013 the album, Flogging a Dead Phoenix, was recorded by ex-bassist Beers to celebrate their 20-year anniversary. It is a chaotic blend of garage rock, punk infused with Motorhead riffs and a brass section. It was partly financed by support from a Pozible project. The release was accompanied by a 92-page full colour edition of the band‚Äôs official magazine, The Vandal‚Äôs Voice. Nancy Vandal promoted the album with an east coast tour through October and December 2013. Daniel Johnson of The Music caught their gig in November at the Zoo in Brisbane, he observed, \\"while they might have grown a little older, they thankfully haven't matured in the traditional sense... their back catalogue... are all as infectious and gloriously ridiculous as ever.\\"  Members = Current  * Fox Trotsky (Mike Foxall) ‚Äì guitar, vocals (1993‚Äì2001, 2003, 2009‚Äìpresent) * JJ La Moore (Jeff Moore) ‚Äì guitar (1993-1996), bass guitar (1997‚Äì2001, 2003, 2009‚Äìpresent) * Bombshell/Tommy Lee Turnip/Mr. Shit/So Cal Snuffel (Dean Bakota) ‚Äì drums (1993-2001, 2003, 2009-present) * Tess/Lickerov Finetesticals/T.Force/T-Bone/T-Banger/T-Burger/T-Man/T-Bag/T-shirt/Slick & thick RobDog (Robert Tickle) ‚Äì trombone, keyboards (1997-2001, 2003, 2009-present) * Gilli Pepper (Gillian Kilgour) ‚Äì saxophone, vocals (1997-2001, 2003, 2009-present)  Former  * Marcus \\"Rolfe\\" Rolfe ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals (1993‚Äì1995) * Jason Jasonn Beers (Jay Whalley) ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals (1995-1996) * Poofy Arse Bogun (Anna Helme) ‚Äì saxophone (1997) * Telaviv Skywalker (Genevieve Murray) ‚Äì trumpet, vocals (1997-1999)  Discography = Albums  * Return of the Zombie Skate poets from Planet Sex (by Nancy Vandal and the Popgun Assassins) (1994) ‚Äì Half Arsed Records (FNARR 69) * 1, 2, 3 Baby Yeah (1995) ‚Äì Half Arsed Records (FNARR 70) * The Debriefing Room (1996) ‚Äì Half Arsed Records (FNARR 73) * Bikini High Pool Party Massacre 3, Who Invited the Undead?

The software typically works in conjunction with Internet usage to control or limit the amount of information made available to third parties. The software can apply encryption or filtering of various kinds. Types of protection Privacy software can refer to two different types of protection. One type is protecting a user's Internet privacy from the World Wide Web. There are software products that will mask or hide a user's IP address from the outside world in order to protect the user from identity theft. The second type of protection is hiding or deleting the users Internet traces that are left on their PC after they have been surfing the Internet. There is software that will erase all the users Internet traces and there is software that will hide and encrypt a user's traces so that others using their PC will not know where they have been surfing. Whitelisting and blacklisting One solution to enhance privacy software is whitelisting. Whitelisting is a process in which a company identifies the software that it will allow to and does not try to recognize malware. Whitelisting permits acceptable software to run and either prevents anything else from running or lets new software run in a quarantined environment until the can verify its validity. Whereas whitelisting allows nothing to run unless it is on the whitelist, blacklisting allows everything to run unless it is on the black. A blacklist then includes certain types of software that are not allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist peer-to-peer file sharing on its systems. In addition to software, people, devices, and web sites can also be whitelisted or blacklisted.  Intrusion detection systems  Intrusion detection systems are designed to detect all types of malicious network traffic and computer usage that cannot be detected by a firewall. These systems capture all network traffic flows and examine the contents of each packet for malicious traffic.  Encryption  Encryption is another form for privacy security. When organizations do not have secure channel for sending information, they use encryption to stop unauthorized eavesdroppers. Encryption is the process of converting an original message into a form that cannot be read by anyone except the intended receiver.  Steganography  Steganography is sometimes used to hide messages from eavesdropping and e-surveillance. Compared to using cryptography, that translates the text itself to another format, stenography hides the data rather than converting it. According to the company Privacy Canada, by using Steganography, they ensure that messages can be hidden from being exposed. Similar to cryptography, the message is encoded for protection in various ways: Text, Image, Audio, Video and Network Steganography. It is a substitute for cryptography in order to conceal texts from being viewed.  Privacy vs anonymity  Privacy is different from anonymity in its applicability and usage. Anonymity is subordinate to privacy and might be desired for the exchange, retrieval or publication of specific information.  Legal issues of use  Uses of privacy software are not free from legal issues. For instance, there are regulations for export of cryptography from the United States.

It has had several corporate ownership failures since and was eventually taken over by Peregrine Investments Holdings who also faced financial collapse, and the Indonesian-backed Lippo Group who are the largest single owner of the building.

In 1988, Rudolph wrote: \\"The aesthetic intent is to...give the building 'presence' when seen at a great distance, from the middle distance, and from close distance, and from close hand. At the same time, it is intended that the building inhabit the sky, and become dematerialized by reflecting the ever changing light.\\" The late muralist-artist Gerard D'Alton Henderson, who designed the walls in the Hong Kong Mandarin Oriental Hotel, enriched the lobby with dramatic bas-relief murals.Gerard D'Alton Henderson: Works & Murals The Lippo Centre is connected to the Central Elevated Walkway network of footbridges.

Richards was a school teacher at Katrine school, and Carter was sometimes asked to assist with teaching. In 1870, Carter took a teaching post at Seven Springs, near Newcastle, but attendance was poor and this affected his salary. The following year he accepted a teaching appointment at Bejoording, where there was a regular attendance of around 25 pupils. He remained there until 1874. During that time he rode to Newcastle (now Toodyay) every weekend to help in a racing stables. He also had a servant, and employed other ex-convicts to cut sandalwood.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987, and is on the National Register of Historic Places . History to present The Wawona Hotel is one of the oldest mountain resort hotels in California, and a classic of Victorian era resort design. The Victorian style hotel was built in 1876 to serve tourists visiting the nearby Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum). As tourism increased, through 1916, the hotel built additional rooms and facilities. In addition, it cut more forest trails, as well as paths along the south fork of the Merced River. The Wawona Hotel is located from the park's south entrance, between the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees and the Yosemite Valley. It is one of the few historical period hotels still standing within Yosemite National Park's boundaries. Most of the hotel's 104 guestrooms open onto one of the Wawona Hotel's deep verandas, which wrap around the first and second floors; they have open views of the gardened and natural landscapes. The hotel includes six historically distinctive buildings, built between 1876 and 1916. The rooms are furnished with antiques, period pieces, and vintage elements. The hotel has no telephones or televisions in the guestrooms. Outdoor recreation choices include quiet nature walks or scenic drives, and when snow arrives, nearby cross-country and downhill skiing and snowshoe routes. Across from the hotel is a nine-hole , par 35 golf course, Yosemite Park's only such facility. It is one of few within any U.S. National Park. The course is open daily from spring to fall, weather permitting. In operation since 1918, the golf course is the oldest in the Sierra Nevada. The hotel is featured prominently in the 1964 World War II thriller 36 Hours, starring James Garner and Eva Marie Saint, in which the hotel serves as a US Military hospital in Waldshut, Germany. On March 1, 2016, the Wawona Hotel was renamed Big Trees Lodge due to a legal dispute between the US Government, which owns the property, in conjunction with the new concessionaire, Aramark, and the outgoing concessionaire, Delaware North, which claimed rights to the trademarked name. The hotel regained its historic name on July 15, 2019, when a settlement was reached in the dispute. Thomas Hill studio Thomas Hill (1829‚Äì1908), a renowned landscape painter of the Hudson River School, stayed at the Wawona Hotel toward the end of his life. He used the hotel pavilion as his painting studio and completed numerous works of the region. This is listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places.

Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including intra-continental United States, intertheater, and intratheater movement legs, staging, and holding areas. Deployments consist of men and women who leave their families and their homes with other service members (Airmen, Marines, Sailors, and Soldiers) and go to another country and earn combat pay. These deployments can last anywhere from 90 days to 15 months. In the United States Army, members receive what is known as a combat patch to wear on their uniforms (ACU's) and Dress Uniforms (Class A's). In most of the world's navies, a deployment designates an extended period of duty at sea. The United States Navy recognizes those who complete deployments with a special decoration known as the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. Redeployment is known as the return of service members in a combat zone to their prior station (i.e. where they are stationed with families, where they were prior to deploying).

The source of the film was the 1891 short story \\"Zenobia's Infidelity\\" by H.C. Bunner, which was originally purchased by producer Hal Roach as a vehicle for Roland Young.https://www.nytimes.com/1938/08/02/archives/screen-news-here-and-in- hollywood-metro-signs-von-sternberg-to.html  Background  Zenobia is one of the few films after the teaming of Laurel and Hardy that features Hardy without Stan Laurel,For Oliver Hardy's films without Stan Laurel, see: Oliver Hardy filmography. the result of a contract dispute between Laurel and producer Hal Roach, who maintained separate contracts for each performer, rather than a team contract, which would have offered them more control over their careers. Zenobia was Roach's attempt to create a new comedic pair without Laurel, and a series of films with Hardy and Langdon was planned. The dispute was short-lived, however, and Laurel and Hardy were reunited shortly thereafter.For details on this dispute, see the main article on Laurel and Hardy. Plot Set in 1870, Hardy plays Dr. Henry Tibbett, a Mississippi country doctor who is called on by a travelling circus trainer to cure his sick elephant. After the doctor heals the grateful beast, the elephant becomes so attached to him that it starts to follow him everywhere. This leads to the trainer suing Dr. Tibbett for alienation of affection.

United Artists even had trouble booking the film into theatres. The New York Times wrote on May 15, 1939, that the film: :\\"...[was] a rough idea of what would happen to Gone With the Wind if Hal Roach had produced it ... an antebellum, costume romance in slapstick, in which an elephant adopts Oliver Hardy and, it appears, Harry Langdon has adopted the partnership perquisites formerly reserved for Stan Laurel.\\" Then‚Äîplaying on the potential for a new comedy team of Hardy and Langdon‚Äîthe reviewer said: :\\"Harry Langdon's pale and beautifully blank countenance ... has probably already excited the professional jealousy of Mr. Laurel.\\" In popular culture The film is mentioned quite frequently (referred to as \\"the elephant movie\\") during the Stan and Ollie biopic. In the film, Laurel begrudged Hardy for doing the film; however, this was not the case in real life, as it was Laurel himself who encouraged Hardy to continue at Roach without him. After his contract was up, Hardy refused to form a new team with Langdon, left Roach, and followed Laurel to Fox.

During his youth, Johnson had attended the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind in Staunton, Virginia. Shortly after West Virginia's statehood, Johnson recognized the need for such a school in the state and he began canvassing the state, gathering support for his project. Several towns including Romney, Clarksburg, and Parkersburg all lobbied to have the school located there, but Romney was selected following an offer consisting of the buildings and grounds of the Romney Literary Society's Romney Classical Institute. The Romney Classical Institute had lain dormant since the American Civil War when its libraries' volumes were destroyed and its campus was left beyond repair. On March 3, 1870, H. H. Johnson's dreams became a reality when the West Virginia Legislature approved a measure calling for the creation of the West Virginia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind. The school opened on September 29, 1870 with thirty students, twenty-five deaf and five blind students. Through the years, additional buildings and grounds have been added to accommodate increasing enrollment.

Retrieved on August 19, 2009. is the largest private sector coal company in the world. Its primary business consists of the mining, sale, and distribution of coal, which is purchased for use in electricity generation and steelmaking. Peabody also markets, brokers, and trades coal through offices in China, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2017, Peabody recorded sales of 191.5 million tons of coal. Peabody markets coal to electricity generating and industrial customers in more than 25 nations on six continents. As of December 31, 2017, the company had approximately 5.2 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Peabody maintains ownership of majority interests in 23 surface and underground mining operations located throughout the United States and Australia. In the United States, company-owned mines are located in Alabama, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Illinois, and Indiana. Peabody's largest operation is the North Antelope Rochelle Mine located in Campbell County, Wyoming, which mined more than 92 million tons of coal in 2016. Peabody spun off coal mining operations in West Virginia and Kentucky into Patriot Coal Corporation in October 2007. In October 2011, Peabody acquired a majority ownership stake in Queensland-based Macarthur Coal Ltd, which specializes in the production of metallurgical coal, primarily seaborne pulverized injection coal. After being named to Fortune Magazine's list of America's Most Admired Companies in 2008, Peabody saw $787 million of losses, was removed from S&P; 500, and had its ratings downgraded to \\"underperform\\" and \\"negative\\" by Goldman Sachs, Standard & Poor, Bank of America, and others in 2014. Despite this, Peabody earned Energy Company of the Year and CEO of the Year at the 2014 Platts Global Energy Awards. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 13, 2016. The company emerged from bankruptcy on April 3, 2017, and started trading on NYSE with a ticker symbol BTU. It also changed the company logo from Peabody Energy to just Peabody. Peabody ranked at No. 491 on the Fortune 500 list released in 2018. It was ranked as the 12th most polluting company on earth by the Guardian in 2019. History=Early years (1883‚Äì1959) The Peabody Energy company was founded as Peabody, Daniels & Company in 1883 by Francis Peabody, the son of a prominent Chicago lawyer, and a partner. The company bought coal from established mines and sold it to homes and businesses in the Chicago area. In the late 1880s, Francis Peabody bought out his partner's share of the business and the company was incorporated in the state of Illinois under the name Peabody Coal Company in 1890. In 1895, it began operations of its first mine in Williamson County, Illinois and later expanded its operations in Illinois. In 1913, the company won its first long-term contract to supply Chicago Edison Company, the predecessor to utility Commonwealth Edison. The company's growth continued after World War I and the corporation went public for the first time in 1929 with a listing on the Midwest Stock Exchange, and in 1949 was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Despite being ranked eighth among the country's top coal producers in the mid-1950s, Peabody began to lose market share to companies operating cost-efficient surface mining operations. To address the situation, it entered into merger talks with Sinclair Coal Company. A merger between the two companies occurred in 1955, resulting in the transfer of Peabody's headquarters to St. Louis, Missouri. The merged company retained the Peabody name. Under the leadership of chairman Russell Kelce, the company expanded production and sales. The Bucyrus Erie 3850-B power shovel named \\"Big Hog\\" went to work next door to Paradise Fossil Plant for Peabody Coal Company's Sinclair surface mine in 1962. When it started work it was received with grand fanfare and was the largest shovel in the world with a bucket size of . After it finished work in the mid 1980s, it was buried in a pit on the mine's property. 1960‚Äì2000 In 1962, Peabody expanded into the Pacific with the opening of mining operations in Queensland, Australia. During this period Peabody also forged an equity partnership with the Japanese trading company Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and the Australian construction company Thiess. In 1968, the company was purchased by the Kennecott Copper Corporation. However, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission challenged the purchase as an antitrust violation. In 1976, the FTC ordered Kennecott to divest itself of Peabody. The newly created Peabody Holding Company purchased the Peabody Coal business of Kennecott for $1.1 billion, and a consortium of companies controlled Peabody-Holding. In the 1980s, Peabody expanded its operations in the Eastern United States, acquiring the West Virginia coal mines of Armco Inc in 1984. The company sought to broaden its metallurgical coal portfolio through the purchase of Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates' seven West Virginia mines in 1987. Peabody also expanded westward, opening the North Antelope and Rochelle mines in the low sulfur Wyodak seam in the heart of Wyoming's Powder River Basin in 1983 and 1984, respectively. The passage of the Clean Air Act amendments in 1990 prompted the closure of some Peabody mines. However, other mines under its ownership were able to remain in operation due to the implementation of new equipment and procedures that reduced sulfur dioxide emissions. Stricter requirements outlined in Phase II of the legislation also prompted Peabody to invest in emissions reducing technologies. In 1990, the U.K.-based conglomerate Hanson plc, one of the owners of Peabody Holding at the time, bought out the rest of the owners. In 1993, Peabody Energy expanded their holdings in the Pacific with the acquisition of three mines in Australia and subsequently developed a fourth operation in New South Wales. Peabody also expanded its operations domestically with acquisitions in New Mexico in 1993 and Wyoming in 1994 and assumed a stake in Black Beauty, a Midwest producer, in response to increased demand for metallurgical coal. 2001‚Äìpresent In 1996, Hanson demerged Peabody and Eastern Group under the name The Energy Group. When TXU acquired The Energy Group, Peabody was sold to Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners. The company filed an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2001, and since this time it has operated as a publicly traded company. In 2002, Peabody launched its Peabody Energy Australia Coal Co. following the acquisition of the Wilkie Creek Mine in Queensland's Surat Basin. The North Goonyella coal mine was acquired by Peabody in 2004. In October 2006, Peabody completed an acquisition of Excel Coal Limited, an independent coal company in Australia. Peabody paid $1.52 billion for Excel and also assumed $227 million of Excel's debt. At the time, Excel owned three operating mines and three development- stage mines in Australia. Additionally, Excel had an estimated 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. As of 2011, Peabody's Australian mining operations are located in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of the company's Australian production is metallurgical coal. The company also advanced a number of coal-to-liquids and coal-to-gas projects to reduce emissions during the decade. On August 30, 2007, Ernie Fletcher, the governor of the U.S. state of Kentucky signed into state law a bill that will provide approximately $300 million in incentives to Peabody to build a coal gasification plant in that state. The resulting incentives were provisioned in the form of breaks on sales taxes, incentive taxes and coal severance taxes. In 2007, Peabody and a consortium of municipal electric cooperatives began construction on the 1600-megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus clean coal project in Lively Grove, Illinois. The company retained a five percent equity stake in the project, which was expected to begin generating power for customers in 2011. Peabody sold its stake in the Prairie State project to the Wabash Valley Power Association in 2016. At the 2010 World Energy Congress, Peabody CEO Gregory Boyce proposed a plan that advocated for the expanded use of coal worldwide, placing emphasis on geographic areas with limited or no access to electricity. On April 13, 2016 it reported, its revenue tumbled 17 percent as coal prices fell and lost 2 billion dollars on the previous year. It then filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 13, 2016. In November 2016, the day after Donald Trump won US presidential election, shares of Peabody Energy surged more than 50 percent. On April 3, 2017 it emerged from bankruptcy and started trading on the NYSE with a ticker symbol of BTU. In October 2017, a judge ruled that Peabody Energy's bankruptcy protected it from \\"global-warming lawsuits brought by California coastal communities [in July 2017] against fossil-fuel companies.\\" In 2018, Peabody announced it plans to invest $10 million in a partnership with London-based Arq, a company that is advancing technology to convert coal into oil products. On December 3rd Peabody completed its purchase of the Shoal Creek Seaborne metallurgical coal mine from private coal producer Drummond Company, Inc. for $387 million. Lines of business Peabody Energy's world headquarters is in St. Louis, and, as of 2014, it also maintains offices in London, Beijing, Singapore, Brisbane, Sydney, Essen, Balikpapan, and Jakarta.\\"Peabody Energy Around the World\\"  Peabody Energy. Retrieved March 22, 2014. In the U.S. West, Peabody operates Powder River Basin operations in Wyoming as well as other mining operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Operations in the U.S. Midwest consist of mines in Indiana and Illinois. Peabody also operates a single underground mine in Colorado. All of these assets are occupied with the mining, preparation, and selling of coal to utility companies or steelmakers. Peabody's Australian operations consist of metallurgical and thermal coal mining operations in Queensland and New South Wales. Purchasers of its coal product include Australian utility companies or steel producers. The Trading and Brokerage function is primarily concerned with the brokering of coal sales, trading coal, and freight or freight-related contracts. A smaller division of Peabody Energy deals with mining, export, and transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, and the management of Peabody's operations and holdings. With growing demand for coal across Asian markets, especially in China, Indonesia, and India, Peabody has expanded its presence in Asia through offices in China, Indonesia, and Singapore. Black Mesa controversy In 1964 Peabody Energy subsidiary Peabody Western Coal signed a series of lease agreements with the Navajo tribe and two years later with the Hopi tribe for mineral rights as well as use of a water source on the Black Mesa, a 2.1-million-acre highland in Northeast Arizona. The company's contracts with the Navajo Nation and Hopi Tribe were approved despite opposition from those who disputed the authority of the official tribal councils. They were also negotiated by natural resources attorney John Sterling Boyden, who represented the Hopi tribe but whose firm had also represented Peabody in other legal matters, contributing to allegations of a conflict of interest. When rail negotiations to transport coal from the project broke down, Peabody designed a coal slurry pipeline similar to a natural gas pipeline to transport the coal 273 miles to the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada. The company pumped potable water from the underground Navajo Aquifer (N-aquifer) to supply the slurry pipeline, a solution that generated controversy. The Navajo Aquifer is a main source of potable water for the Navajo and Hopi tribes, who use the water for farming and livestock maintenance as well as drinking and other domestic uses. Members of the tribes as well as outside environmental groups have alleged that the pumping of water by Peabody Energy has caused contamination of water sources and a severe decline in potable water. Peabody contends that operations consumed only one percent of the aquifer's water. Peabody developed and operated two strip mines on the Black Mesa reservation: the Black Mesa Mine and the Kayenta Mine. The Black Mesa Mine suspended operations in 2006 after the mine's sole customer, the Mohave Station, was retired. The site was fully decommissioned in January 2010.  Misleading investors about climate change  In 2015, an investigation by the New York Attorney General concluded that Peabody had misled investors concerning the financial risks to the company caused by climate change. The settlement of the case required the company to revise its financial disclosures with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement did not require any financial penalties or admission of legal wrongdoing. Environmental record The practice of extracting coal from the earth for energy production purposes has been the subject of controversy for an extended duration of time. The Sierra Club has expressed concern regarding Peabody Energy's initial opposition to the Clean Air Act and other environmental regulations, as well as its support for the expanded use of coal generated electricity as a means of meeting increasing worldwide energy usage demands. The Natural Resources Defense Council has been critical of Peabody's advocacy for expanding coal generated electricity in the U.S., specifically on account of the environmental impacts of surface mining operations. The environmental impact of Peabody's surface mining operations in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky was also the subject of criticism in John Prine's 1971 song \\"Paradise.\\" In Newsweek's 2011 rankings of the least eco-friendly companies in the US, Peabody Energy was ranked #9 out of the top 500 largest US companies based on their environmental impact. Peabody launched its first land reclamation program, Operation Green Earth, in 1954. Since then, Peabody's activities in regards to the pursuit of its mission, specifically concerning environmental sustainability practices, have been recognized by regulators and industry groups, but have raised concerns among its critics, primarily environmental advocacy organizations. The company has taken steps to enact environmental restoration and has been recognized by the United States Department of the Interior, for their reclamation efforts. In response to federal legislation, such as the 1970 Clean Air Act and the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, and environmental criticism of its mining operations, Peabody has directed investments in technologies and equipment that serve to mitigate adverse environmental effects of their coal mining operations. In 2007, the company became the only non-Chinese equity partner in the 650-megawatt near-zero emissions GreenGen clean-coal project in Tianjin, China. Peabody has also invested in the development of carbon capture technologies and coal-to-gas and coal-to-hydrogen projects. In 2014, Peabody Energy's CEO told a coal industry conference that coal-fired electricity generation would bring public health benefits in developing nations, specifically improving cold-chain refrigeration of a potential future Ebola vaccine. Peabody's claim was criticized by three public health academics as \\"an insult\\", and an \\"opportunistic attempt and somewhat desperate to relate corporate self- interest to a massive public health crisis\\". In Newsweek's 2012 Green Rankings‚Äîcomparisons of the environmental footprint, management, and transparency of the largest public companies in America‚ÄîPeabody Energy was ranked 493rd out of 500 in all industries and 29th out of 31 in the energy industry. The company received the worst possible Environmental Impact score. Peabody Energy often used \\"self-bonding\\" to guarantee it could pay for its mine reclamation obligations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. On March 28, 2016 the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality assured the federal Office of Surface Mining that Peabody Energy's self- bonding remained adequate. Before Peabody Energy declared bankruptcy it held $1.47 billion in self-bonding liabilities, including $900.5 million in Wyoming alone. In 2016, Peabody reached settlement agreements with Illinois, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Indiana related to its self-bonding obligations. Marketing, public relations, and lobbying=American Legislative Exchange Council Kelly Mader represented Peabody Energy on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and Peabody has funded ALEC. Advanced Energy for Life In 2014 Peabody Energy Corp. launched a pro- coal advertising and public relations campaign named Advanced Energy for Life, with the stated aim of \\"educating and mobilising world leaders, multinational organisations, a wide range of institutions and stakeholders and the general public to end the crisis of global energy poverty\\". The campaign was created by Burson-Marsteller, the world's largest PR firm, and its subsidiary, Proof Integrated Communications.  Climate change denial  Peabody has been an important actor in organized climate change denial. Until 2015, Peabody had claimed that global warming isn't a threat and emitting carbon dioxide is beneficial instead of being dangerous. The company also funded at least two dozen climate change denial organizations and front groups such as the George C. Marshall Institute, the Institute for Energy Research, Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, and the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change as well as scientists being famous for their contrarian opinions, among them Willie Soon, Richard Lindzen and Roy Spencer. Nick Surgey, director of research for the Center for Media and Democracy, commented on the sheer scale of Peabody's funding activities: \\"We expected to see some denial money, but it looks like Peabody is the treasury for a very substantial part of the climate denial movement.\\" Peabody plans to continue to oppose the Clean Power Plan during its bankruptcy.

He is the managing director (MD) and CEO of Latitude Financial Services, and was formerly MD and CEO of Australia Post, and CEO Australia of the National Australia Bank (NAB).  Early life and career  Fahour was born in Lebanon in 1966 and migrated to Australia with his parents, Abdel and Siham, in 1969. His parents became successful businesspeople in Australia and have eight children. He studied at St Joseph's College in North Fitzroy and later attended Redden College in Preston. In 1987, he graduated from La Trobe University in Melbourne with a bachelor's degree of Economics. He went on to complete a Master of Business Administration at Melbourne Business School in 1993 while working for Boston Consulting Group. He became a director of the group in 1997, and spent a year as co-managing director of its joint-venture investment company, Iformation. Fahour joined NAB in September 2004 as CEO Australia, and became an executive member of the board. In February 2009, he stepped down from the principal board and group executive committee. Fahour has held directorships of Nasdaq Dubai, Rip Curl and has been a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He was invited by the Prime Minister and Treasurer to be the interim CEO of the Australian Business Investment Partnership.  Australia Post  In December 2009, Fahour was announced as the new MD and CEO of Australia Post (a federal government-owned business), commencing in February 2010. There, he commenced a business renewal program, called \\"Future Ready\\". The program involved the implementation of a more customer-focused business model designed to capitalise on Australia Post's reputation as a trusted services provider. Under Fahour's direction, Australia Post had two consecutive years of profit growth (in FY2011 and FY2012) following steep profit declines in the preceding two years (FY2009 and FY2010), as Australian letter volumes started to decline. Further letter volume decline led to reduced profits in FY2013 and FY2014, with repeated calls from Fahour for the government to support fundamental reform of the letter service to prevent Australia Post incurring future losses. In March 2012, Fahour announced plans to create the \\"Australia Post Digital MailBox\\", as part of the postal corporation's strategy \\"to build a sustainable communications business, both physically and digitally\\". The Digital MailBox was given a soft launch at Parliament House, Canberra, in October 2012 and it was officially opened to Australian consumers for the first time in May 2013. In June 2014, Fahour was widely criticised for his $4.8 million salary, whilst sacking 900 staff. He was once Australia's highest-paid public servant, receiving a total salary package of $5.6 million (including a $1.2 million bonus) in 2016. Under Fahour's leadership, in 2015 Australia Post recorded its first full-year loss in over 30 years, with half-year profits down some 56 percent. In February 2017, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull criticised Fahour's $5.6 million salary saying, \\"As the Prime Minister and a taxpayer, I've spoken to the chairman today. I think that salary, that remuneration, is too high.\\" On 23 February, Australia Post announced that Fahour has resigned as MD and CEO of Australia Post, and would step down from the role in July 2017. Upon resigning from CEO of Australia Post, in July 2017 Fahour joined BCG Digital Ventures as non-executive chairman for Asia-Pacific. Later career In 2011, Fahour was appointed the Australian Government's special envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. In 2014, Fahour was appointed chairman of Pro-Pac Packaging Group (PPG). The same year he was appointed an adjunct professor at La Trobe Business School and became a fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. In 2017 Fahour was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to business, particularly in the area of postal communications, to the banking and investment sectors, and as a supporter of improved multicultural relations. In October 2018, Fahour was appointed MD and CEO of Latitude Financial Services. Views on extremism Fahour says the best way to counter Islamic extremism is to give Muslim young people jobs and opportunities. He says that extremists misinterpret Islamic teachings such as the Quranic injunction, 'whoever kills an innocent person, it's as if he has killed all of mankind'. Personal life Fahour lives in Hawthorn, Melbourne, in a house that he bought in 2013 from Globe International co-founder Peter Hill for $20 million. The house was originally built for Sir James Frederick Palmer, the first Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Council and was later owned by the comic and entrepreneur George Coppin, before becoming a private school. Fahour and his family have made significant financial contributions to the Islamic Museum of Australia, the founder and director of which is his brother, Moustafa Fahour, a former Macquarie Bank executive. His sister, MasterChef participant Samira El Khafir, is the head chef and manages the cafe on site. Moustafa's wife, Maysaa, is the chairwoman and director. Fahour was married to Dionnie and has four children. He has four brothers and three sisters.

It is a section of the Little Miami Scenic Trail within the Loveland, Ohio city limits in Clermont County. Like most of the longer trail, it was built along the right-of-way of the abandoned Little Miami Railroad, on the Little Miami River. Along with 15 other city parks, the trail corridor is maintained by City of Loveland Recreation Commission. The trail was opened in the 1980s and became part of the Little Miami Scenic Trail in 1984. More than 100,000 people accessed the Little Miami Scenic Trail via the Loveland trailhead in 2014. Each summer from 1997 to 2000 and from 2002 to 2004, the city held a cycling race, Tour de Loveland, named after the Tour de France, that promoted the Loveland Bike Trail as the centerpiece of Historic Downtown Loveland. It featured a route for professional cyclists that included many Downtown streets, as well as separate races for younger cyclists. In June 1998, the USA Cycling Elite National Championship time trials and criterium were held in conjunction with the Tour de Loveland. On January 24, 2005, Loveland City Council voted to cancel the Tour, due to declining attendance and a lack of sponsors.

Sherwood's program of interest is the international studies program, and it is also known for its music and athletic programs. Sherwood draws students from Farquhar and Rosa Parks Middle Schools. Sherwood serves the areas of Olney, Ashton, and Brookeville. History Sherwood Academy was built on a piece of land donated in 1883, that was once part of Sherwood Farm ‚Äì named because the abundance of trees was reminiscent of Robin Hood's Sherwood Forest. In 1906, Sherwood became the third public high school in Montgomery County, after Richard Montgomery High School and Gaithersburg High School. The original school building was replaced in 1950, and the 1,000-seat Ertzman theatre was added in 1974. The school was renovated in 1989-1991, during which students were temporarily moved to the Northwood High School building in Silver Spring. During the summer of 2007, a new wing was added to the school, creating new classrooms for science and English. Student body Sherwood High School had 1,922 students enrolled for the 2016-2017 school year. The school's student body was 50% non-Hispanic Caucasian, 17% African American, 11% Asian, and 18% Hispanic. The graduation rate for the school was 93.6%, with 79.3% planning to go on to college. In SAT testing, students had an average score of 553 (math), 532 (verbal), and 1085 (total), which placed Sherwood under the Montgomery County average of 1102 (total), but above the national average of 1028 (total). Approximately 65% of the students took an AP exam during the 2010-2011 school year, and about 74% of them passed. Academics The International Studies Program distinguishes the school by providing a uniquely focused program. The program was established in 1998, coinciding with broader restructuring that occurred with the opening of the nearby James Hubert Blake High School. Blake High School, along with Paint Branch High School and Springbrook High School, formed the Northeast Consortium of schools. The consortium provides each with a uniquely specialized program which students can opt for instead of attending their local school. While Sherwood is not a member of the consortium, it established the International Studies Program. Sherwood is a member of the International Studies Schools Association, a national network of schools dedicated to improving students' understanding of the world. In 2006, Sherwood High School was listed in Newsweeks top 1200 American High Schools, as the 388th highest- rated school in the country, up 61 places from its 2005 ranking of 449. In 2008 the Leaves yearbook theme was \\"What Does It Take To Be a Warrior?\\" A new system of academies was implemented beginning with the class of 2013. Students choose from four academies: Business and Hospitality; Engineering and Technology; Science; and Arts and Humanities. The academies allow students to specialize in their area of interest. Music Sherwood High School has music programs, including the annual Rock 'n Roll Revival show, which was established in 1971. The original concept for the show was conceived by a group of Sherwood students who were inspired after seeing a concert at Madison Square Garden in October 1971. Faculty members also appeared in the first show in 1972. The show includes the performance of a mix of songs from the late 1950s to the late 1990s. Each March, Rock 'n' Roll Revival has performances over two weekends at Ertzman Theatre, with a seventh performance for students in area middle and elementary schools. Sherwood High School also has an Instrumental Music Department and offers jazz band, jazz lab, concert band, and symphonic orchestra. Also offered are choruses including jazz choir, show choir, and a women's chorus. Athletics The Sherwood Warriors varsity football team has won several Maryland state championships, including 1995, 1996, and 2008. The boys' soccer team won the 2004 and 2005 Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association championships. During the 2008 cross country season, Solomon Haile went undefeated en route the 4A Maryland State individual title and the Footlocker Cross Country Championship individual title. The Sherwood varsity basketball team won the 4A Maryland State Championship, held at the Comcast Center at the University of Maryland, College Park, on March 10, 2007.

In 2017 the airport recorded 378,777 aircraft movements, making it the 25th busiest airport in the world by aircraft movements and the busiest general aviation airport in the world.http://www.aci.aero/Data-Centre/Annual-Traffic- Data/Movements/2010-final  History  In the 1950s, the Sperry Flight Systems Company established an aerospace/defense manufacturing facility on land north of Phoenix's city limits in what was mostly undeveloped desert. While the plant was under construction, roughly 480 acres to the north nearby was also leased as the potential site for a new flight testing facility. Later on this land was developed into a private airport and then sold, in 1971, to the City of Phoenix. A number of flight research and general aviation firms soon made the new airport their base of operations.https://aeroactivitiesclub.com/company-history Federal Aviation Administration funding enabled upgrades to the terminal building, flight control tower, runways, and many other facilities and safety features.  Usage  There is no scheduled airline service, but charter service is available through several companies.  Facilities and aircraft  The airport covers at an elevation of 1,478 feet (450 m). It has two asphalt runways: 7R/25L is 8,196 by 100 feet (2,498 x 30 m) and 7L/25R is 4,500 by 75 feet (1,372 x 23 m). In 2017 the airport had 378,777 aircraft operations, average 1,037 per day: 99% general aviation, <1% military and <1% airline. 942 aircraft were then based at the airport: 807 single-engine, 90 multi-engine, 23 jet, 16 helicopter, 4 glider, and 2 military.

William Lloyd (never using his given name John) (June 4, 1857 ‚Äì October 23, 1940) was an American individualist anarchist from 1884 to around 1904. He was born in Westfield, New Jersey; he later moved to Kansas, then Iowa, then to experimental colonies in Tennessee and Florida, before returning to New Jersey in 1888. He based his anarchism upon natural law, rather than on egoism as Benjamin Tucker did. His first book, \\"Wind-Harp Songs\\" (poetry), was published in 1895 (\\"Anarchists' March,\\" a printed musical score with words by Lloyd, had been issued by Tucker in 1888). He founded an anarchist group, The Comradeship of Free Socialists, in 1897. His work, \\"The Red Heart in a White World: A Suggestive Manual of Free Society; Containing a Method and a Hope,\\" formed the basis for it. Lloyd later modified his position to minarchism. His life changed when in that year, reading Edward Carpenter while riding on a train to N.Y., he experienced \\"Cosmic Consciousness\\" (R.M. Bucke devoted a chapter to Lloyd in his 1901 book of that title). This inspired his book, \\"Dawn-Thought on the Reconciliation: a Volume of Pantheistic Impressions and Glimpses of Larger Religion\\" (1900). He founded his magazine, \\"The Free Comrade,\\" which first ran from 1900 to 1902. There he championed anarchism, free love, Whitman (\\"Our American Shakespeare, and greater than he\\") and Edward Carpenter (\\"The greatest man of modern England\\"). In 1902 and 1904 were published his two utopian novels, \\"The Natural Man: A Romance of the Golden Age\\" and \\"The Dwellers in Vale Sunrise: How They Got Together and Lived Happy Ever After. A Sequel to 'The Natural Man,' Being an Account of the Tribes of Him.\\" The Free Comrade resumed publication in a new series, which ran from 1910 to 1912. Lloyd now co-edited it with his friend Leonard D. Abbott, who financed its publication. Between the end of the original series and the beginning of the new, Lloyd had stopped considering himself a pure anarchist, indeed joining the Socialist Party (\\"I am still anarchistic in the essential sense.... the great need of Socialism is a stronger infusion of Anarchism....\\"). Meanwhile his friend Abbott had moved from socialism towards anarchism. They saw the new series \\"as an advocate of the juncture of the Anarchist and Socialist forces.\\" Lloyd's writings appeared in Benjamin Tucker's \\"Liberty\\"; in Moses Harman's anarchist and free love journal, \\"Lucifer the Light Bearer\\"; the anarchist and sex-radical newspaper \\"Fair Play\\"; the anarchist paper \\"Free Society,\\" Horace Traubel's \\"Conservator\\"; etc. He had a column in \\"Ariel,\\" published by the Christian Socialist George Littlefield. He wrote hundreds of poems, many of which appeared in anarchist periodicals. He wrote many books. Besides those listed above, they include \\"Aw-Aw Tam Indian Nights: Being the Myths and Legends of the Pimas of Arizona\\" (1911); \\"Karezza Method,\\" a sex manual (first published clandestinely ca. 1918); \\"Eneres,\\" published by Allen & Unwin in 1929 and Houghton Mifflin in 1930, with an introduction by Havelock Ellis; and at least 14 other works, mostly poetry. In \\"Edward Carpenter: In Appreciation,\\" edited by Gilbert Beith (Allen & Unwin, 1931), Will S. Monroe wrote, \\"Carpenter's most devoted American disciple is J. William Lloyd, who did more than any other follower in the United States (Ernest Crosby excepted) to familiarize our countrymen with his doctrines.\\" He contrasted his idea of free love to that of \\"the artistic free-lovers, the Bohemians\\": \\"My view of sex is religious, I might almost say, touched with austerity. Sex and love to me are sacred and woman their priestess. Sex should not be cultivated as a sybaritic indulgence, but with reference always to spiritual uplift, mental inspiration, physical health, individual fulfillment and racial progress-- always with reference to higher uses.\\" (Free Comrade, July 1910). Lloyd supported the Allies in World War I. He moved to California in 1922. In the 1930s he promoted the ideas of Edward Bellamy. But throughout his life he maintained friendly relations with former associates. He died in 1940. Though at times called a \\"drugless physician,\\" Lloyd never graduated from the water- cure medical college he attended as a young man. Archival material by Lloyd can be found in the Labadie collection at the University of Michigan and at the von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama. Sex theorist A sex theorist, Lloyd strongly criticized patriarchy and sexual possessiveness and exclusivity. He viewed the historical fall of Matriarchy as \\"the great crime,\\" and saw jealousy as akin to monopoly attained by legal power. He developed a concept which he called \\"The Larger Love.\\" As he wrote in 1929, \\"In my later twenties I conceived the most beautiful ideal of my whole life; one that has remained with me ever since, thru [sic] all the years, and which I feel is my special message to humanity, my gospel and prophecy for the future.... The Larger Love, actualized, would be a state of human love- and sex-relation in which each human being of adult age, male or female, would normally have a Central Love, that is a mate who in loyalty, tenderness, reliability and fitness would fill the place of the mate in monogamic ideals, excepting that it would be expected and usually occur that each partner in this union would also have one or several Side Lovers, that is, close friends or mates of the opposite sex, whose affection might not express itself sexually, but could do so without any social surprize [sic] or reproach, and probably usually would do so, at least at certain times. This whole group to form affectionally and spiritually a Love Family, or Love Group, socially recognized and approved as such, but not legally bound together in any way. But as each side Lover would also normally have a Central Lover and center another group, it is plain that these love groups would be very closely intertwined and woven together.\\" His \\"Karezza Method\\" advocated sexual intercourse without seminal emission. (\\"In the highest form and best expression of the art neither man nor woman has or desires to have the orgasm...\\") In his Karezza book, Lloyd addresses such concerns as the question of semen buildup. He concluded from examples of sterilized men that semen is absorbed back into the body, if it is not let out. Lloyd openly questioned the trend toward viewing orgasm as purely beneficial. Concerning the male, he pointed to a standard stockbreeder practice to not let a bull or a stallion serve too many or too often so as not to devitalize him. This practical knowledge of businessmen to him was unbiased evidence on the effects of ejaculation.Lloyd (1931), p. 60-64. Lloyd observed that karezza offered health benefits. For example, he said he knew it to ‚Äúact like magic in painful menstruation,‚Äù and as a remarkable nerve sedative, even curing nervous headache. He also found it one of the best agents ‚Äúfor the benefit and cure of ordinary sexual weaknesses and ailments, including urethritis and prostatitis.‚Äù > In successful Karezza the sex-organs become quiet, satisfied, demagnetized, > as perfectly as by the orgasm, while the rest of the body of each partner > glows with a wonderful vigor and conscious joy ... tending to irradiate the > whole being with romantic love; and always with an after-feeling of health, > purity and well-being. We are most happy and good-humored as after a full > meal.Lloyd (1931), p. 13. However, he was ‚Äúwilling to concede that where the intercourse is of such a nature as to cause a congestion that is not sublimated, or where sexual congestion occurs and sublimation and [karezza] are not available, the orgasm may have a necessary place.‚Äù In Lloyd‚Äôs day, some people objected to karezza on the grounds that it would encourage excessive indulgence in sexual relations. He responded: > Those who do not use Karezza are vastly more liable to excess, and this > usually from too frequent and intense orgasms, too frequent pregnancies, or > too coarse, cynical and invasive an attitude. Where there is merely a > physical itch or craving gratified, with no mutual tenderness or kindness, > or perhaps actually against the desire or protest of one party, sex is > always excessive.Lloyd (1931), p. 52 Lloyd offered many practical ideas for successful karezza, including the need for lovers to give in order to benefit from controlled intercourse. ‚ÄúTry to feel yourself a magnetic battery,‚Äù he advised. > As you acquire the habit of giving your sexual electricity out in blessing > to your partner from your sex-organs, hands, lips, skin, eyes and voice, you > will acquire the power to satisfy yourself and her without an orgasm. Soon > you will not even think of self-control, because you will have no desire for > the orgasm, nor will she.Lloyd (1931), p. 31. Karezza, said Lloyd, is the greatest beautifier because it increases and makes enduring heart love. He advised that to increase sexual control, ‚Äúkeep the spiritual on top, dominant‚Äîloving is the first thing, and at-one-ment ... of your souls, your real end.‚Äù ‚ÄúSex is very close to soul.... [It only satisfies] when it unites souls, not merely copulates bodies for a thrill.‚Äù In a chapter called ‚ÄúDoes the Woman Need the Orgasm?‚Äù he explained in karezza, the lady ‚Äúmelts‚Äù her whole being to her partner and there is not an orgasm in the ordinary definition of the word, yet beneficial physical relaxation also occurs.Lloyd (1931), p. 39-40. He wrote that the full magnetic rapport of karezza occurs when: > Two souls and bodies seem as one, supported and floating on some divine > stream in Paradise.... This is the real ideal and end of Karezza. You will > finally enter into such unity that in your fullest embrace you can hardly > tell yourselves apart and can read each other‚Äôs thoughts. You will feel a > physical unity as if her blood flowed in your veins, her flesh were yours. > For this is the Soul-Blending Embrace.Lloyd (1931), p. 48, 32.

It is the third installment of the Whispering Corridors film series set in girls high schools, but, as with all films in the series, is unrelated to the others; apart from a song being sung in one scene that is a pivotal plot in Voice.http://www.cine21.com/news/view/mag_id/21840http://tenasia.hankyung.com/archives/277977 Plot Yun Jin-sung (Song Ji-hyo) and Kim So-hee (Park Han-byul) are best friends studying ballet at an all-girls art school. However, their friendship turns sour when they find themselves competing for a single spot in a Russian ballet school. Jin-sung learns from an odd student named Eom Hye-ju (Jo An) of an old legend that if a person climbs the twenty eight steps leading up to the school's dormitory and finds a twenty ninth, then a fox spirit will grant that person's wish. Curious, Jin-sung climbs the stairs and comes across the twenty ninth, happily wishing to gain the spot. To her surprise and anger, So-hee is selected instead. Jin-sung declares her hatred toward her and accidentally sends So-hee down a flight of stairs during a scuffle. So-hee is left unconsciousness and hospitalized. Jin-sung learns that So-hee is no longer able to study ballet due to her injuries from the fall. She tries to apologize, but receives no reply and leaves guilty. The next day, she learns that So-hee has committed suicide. As the fight between the two was witnessed by several others, Jin-sung is now looked down upon by the students, who believe that she intentionally pushed So-hee out of jealousy. Jin-sung's wish comes true and she gets the spot for the ballet school but her fellow students treat her coldly. Affected by So-hee's death, as she was the only one to treat her with kindness, Hye-ju attempts to keep So-hee's belongings for herself, but is ridiculed for it, mainly by Han Yun-ji. She climbs the steps and wishes for So-hee to come back. So-hee returns as a twisted spirit who possesses Hye- ju. The possessed Hye-ju confronts Yun-ji for bullying her and stabs her to death. Jin-Sung encounters Hye-ju, who tries to convince her that she is So- hee. The spirit of So-hee makes Hye-ju light a match, leaving the troubled girl to perish in flames. While Jin-sung is preparing to leave for the ballet school, she is haunted by So-hee. Unable to endure it, she tries to climb the stairs again in order to wish her away. Before she can reach the top, So-hee appears and holds her as Jin-sung confesses that she didn't hate her and simply wanted to be happy. Believing that Jin-sung does not love her as much she does, So-hee crushes Jin-sung's stomach with her arms, killing her, then vanishes. Some time later, a new girl moves into the dorm room that Jin-sung once occupied. A picture with Jin-sung and So-hee on it is seen on the floor. In the photo, So-hee's irises disappear, implying that she still remains. Cast *Song Ji-hyo - Yun Jin-sung *Park Han-byul - Kim So-hee *Jo An - Eom Hye-ju *Park Ji-yeon - Han Yun-ji *Kong Sang-ah - Kyeong-jin *Lee Se-yeon - Young-seon *Hong Soo-ah - sculpture club member *Lee Min-jung - dance double for Yun Jin-sung *Kwak Ji-min - dance class junior *Moon Jung-hee - dance teacher  Notes The film itself seems to mirror the ballet Giselle, which girls in the film are studying, as well as drawing upon the classic short story The Monkey's Paw, with So-hee as Giselle, and Jin-sung as Albrecht. Unhappy with always having to play the \\"prince\\" to So-hee's princess, Jin-sung betrays So-hee, which in turn leads to So-hee being crippled and commits suicide after her friend Jin-sung confesses she has hated her all along. When So-hee's spirit is wished back, Jin-sung is haunted by So-hee's ghost, the love she once felt for her friend warped by Jin-sung's hurtful actions. As in the two previous movies, this film has strong themes of friendship, betrayal, and the taboo of lesbian affairs in an all-girls school.

Biochemistry In reference to biochemistry, this is an important concept as far as kinetics is concerned in metalloproteins. This can allow for the rapid synthesis and degradation of substrates in biological systems. Biology=Cells Labile cells refer to cells that constantly divide by entering and remaining in the cell cycle. These are contrasted with \\"stable cells\\" and \\"permanent cells\\". An important example of this is in the epithelium of the cornea, where cells divide at the basal level and move upwards, and the topmost cells die and fall off. Proteins In medicine, the term \\"labile\\" means susceptible to alteration or destruction. For example, a heat-labile protein is one that can be changed or destroyed at high temperatures. The opposite of labile in this context is \\"stable\\". Soils Compounds or materials that are easily transformed (often by biological activity) are termed labile. For example, labile phosphate is that fraction of soil phosphate that is readily transformed into soluble or plant-available phosphate. Labile organic matter is the soil organic matter that is easily decomposed by microorganisms. Chemistry The term is used to describe a transient chemical species. As a general example, if a molecule exists in a particular conformation for a short lifetime, before adopting a lower energy conformation (structural arrangement), the former molecular structure is said to have 'high lability' (such as C25, a 25-carbon fullerene spheroid). The term is sometimes also used in reference to reactivity ‚Äì for example, a complex that quickly reaches equilibrium in solution is said to be labile (with respect to that solution).

It is similar to Anno Mundi. Description For example, a date Anno Domini (AD) becomes Anno Lucis (AL) . This calendar era, which would designate 4001 BC as 'year zero', was adopted in the 18th century as a simplification of the Anno Mundi era dating system used in the Hebrew calendar and borrowing from other ideas of that time regarding the year of creation. After the Masoretic text was published, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and it was received with wide support.A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures, Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, pp. 10-24. Proposed calculations of the date of creation, using the Masoretic from the 10th century to the 18th century, were numerous and fluctuated by many decades. Notably, Isaac Newton's calculation pointed at the year 4000 BC. Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation, Archbishop Ussher's specific chronology dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular in Christendom, mainly because this specific date was attached to the King James Bible. The Hebrew Calendar has traditionally, since the 4th century AD by Hillel II, dated the creation to 3761 BC, in accordance with the Seder Olam Rabbah compiled by Jose ben Halafta in AD 160, and in agreement with The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries, in which the Muslim chronologist al-Biruni identifies anno mundi as 3448 years before the Seleucid era, but not with Seder Olam Zutta, which dates it to 4339 BC and was compiled in AD 804.Young's Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible, 1879, 8th Edition, 1939‚Äîentry under 'Creation', quoting Dr. William Hales New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy, Vol. 1, 1830, p. 210.

A postage stamp dedicated to Shantaram was released by India Post on 17 November 2001. Personal life Shantaram was born in 1901 at Kolhapur to a Marathi family with a Jain Kasar father and Hindu mother. In 1921, aged 20, he married 12-year-old Vimalabai, a girl of his own community and similar background, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian manner. Their marriage lasted their entire lives and its relationships of harmony and mutual support survived even his subsequent two marriages, which were concurrent with his first. Vimalabai bore four children, being son Prabhat Kumar (after whom Shantaram named his movie company) and daughters Saroj, Madhura and Charusheela. Shantaram's second daughter Madhura is the wife of Pandit Jasraj and mother of music director Shaarang Dev Pandit and of TV personality Durga Jasraj.Jai ho! Jasraj. The Hindu. 8 October 2007. Shantaram's third daughter, Charusheela, is the mother of Hindi and Marathi actor Sushant Ray a.k.a. Siddharth Ray. On 22 October 1941, Shantaram (aged 40) married the actress Jayashree (n√©e Kamulkar), with whom he had fallen in love while they worked together in several films, including Shakuntala (1942) which ran for 104 weeks in Mumbai. Jayashree became Shantaram's second wife, and was received with traditional ceremonies by his first wife Vimalabai. Until January 1957, it was perfectly legal (and in keeping with ancient custom) for Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, and it was typical for the wives to live harmoniously together in the same household. Jayashree bore Shantaram three children ‚Äì one son, the Marathi film director and producer Kiran Shantaram, and two daughters, Rajshree (the actress) and Tejashree. Shantaram's seven children grew up playing and bonding with each other. The two wives also had a cordial relationship and often interacted with each other, although they maintained separate houses. Vimalabai was strongly bonded with Shantaram's extended family; she would be at her husband's side at all religious and family finctions that they attended, and she would be hostess whenever they themselves hosted such functions. On the other hand, Jayashree would accompany Shantaram to all events and functions connected with the film industry and the film profession and at any parties he hosted for the film fraternity. In the early 1950s, Shantaram grew close to another of his leading ladies, the actress Sandhya (n√©e Vijaya Deshmukh), who was his co-star in many films like Do Aankhen Barah Haath, Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje, Navrang, Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli and Sehra. Vimalabai did not have much contact with Shantaram's professional associates and took Sandhya in her stride, but the case was different with Jayashree, who came to regard Sandhya as an ambitious gold-digger who was using the middle-aged Shantaram for her own purposes, to become a successful actress at his expense and riding on his shoulders. Things came to a head during the making of Do Aankhen Barah Haath, a film which Shantaram was producing and which featured him and Sandhya in the main roles. Shantaram ran short of money while making the film, and asked his wives to give him their jewellery so that he could mortgage the same and raise funds to get over the cash crunch. The jewellery would be redeemed and returned to the ladies after the movie was completed, he said. Vimalabai agreed without fuss and handed over her jewellery, but Jayashree did not, apparently because she suspected that the jewellery would end up in Sandhya's possession. This led to a misunderstanding between the couple. Later, Jayashree realized that money was indeed the problem and that in fact, even Sandhya had parted with her jewels in order to help Shantaram. When she came to know this, Jayashree felt bad that she was the only person to have retained her jewellery. On some minor occasion (a birthday), she tried to make amends by gifting some of her jewellery to Sandhya, so that the latter could have some jewels at least. However, Sandhya declined the gift by saying that she had lately stopped wearing jewellery. Jayashree took offence at the snub and the rift between the ladies grew. It became clear that they would not be able to live harmoniously together the way Vimalabai and Jayashree were living. It also became clear that there existed a widening rift between Jayashree and Shantaram also. Finally, Shantaram and Jayashree were divorced on 13 November 1956. This was one of the earliest divorces to be granted in India, because it happened only weeks after parliament passed a law making it possible for Hindus to get a divorce; previous to this, divorce had been literally impossible for Hindus. According to Shantaram's daughter by Vimalabai, neither Shantaram not Jayashree could ever forget each other in later life and both of them deeply regretted that the parting of ways. Hardly a month after the divorce, on 22 December 1956, Shantaram married Sandhya. This marriage was also legally valid because the law which forbade bigamy for Hindu men would come into effect only on 1 January 1957; it was therefore one of the last bigamous marriages to be conducted among Hindus in India. Sandhya had met Vimalabai many times before her wedding, and when the wedding was being finalized, she told Vimalabai that she would only marry Shantaram if Vimalabai not only gave her willing consent but also permitted her to stay in the same house with her. Touched by Sandhya's humility, goodness and traditional values, Vimalabai wholeheartedly gave her consent. She performed the traditional ceremonies and received her new co-wife into her household. The two ladies lived together harmoniously in the same house not just during Shantaram's lifetime but even after his death. Vimalabai and Sandhya enjoyed a close and cordial relationship with each other, which was enhanced because of the large age difference between them, because of their common values of pativratha sanskar, and also because it was known from the beginning that Sandhya would never bear children. This was because Shantaram had undergone an operation after the birth of Jayashree's third child, which left him incapable of begetting further progeny. Sandhya had been informed of this fact and had accepted it knowingly, which earned her great respect in her new home and put to rest all the speculation about her being a gold-digger. She would often say in Marathi ‚ÄúHey sagle majhe mula aahet (all these are my kids)\\" indicating Shantaram's seven children. Sandhya treated Vimalabai with great respect at all times, and Vimalabai looked upon Sandhya with deep affection. In the professional field, Sandhya worked exclusively with her husband and refused all film offers made by other film-makers. She starred in some of Shantaram's biggest hits like Do Aankhen Barah Haath, Navrang, Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje and Pinjra. Shantaram died on 30 October 1990 in Mumbai.Biography American Film Institute. He was survived by all three of his wives. Even his second wife Jayashree, who was divorced from him, attended his funeral rites, participated in the rituals, and took to wearing the garb of a widow thereafter, thus indicating that the piece of legal paper which constituted their divorce was only a paper. Vimalabai and Sandhya continued to reside together in one house along with Vimalabai's son Prabhat and his wife and children. Vimalabai died in 1996 after being bedridden for four years. Sandhya lives today in the care and company of Vimalabai's children, especially of Prabhat and his family. Shantaram used to live at Panhala near Kolhapur in Maharashtra state. His daughter Saroj has maintained his house and has converted it into a hotel named Valley View.

Established in 2001, it replaced the Sydney Light Rail Company (SLRC), the previous owner of the light rail, and CGEA Transport Sydney, the previous owner of the monorail. It was bought by the New South Wales Government in 2012. The Metro Transport Sydney brand was discontinued from 1 July 2013, and the SLRC and Metro Transport Sydney were deregistered later that month. Metro Transport Sydney contracted the day-to-day operations of the monorail and light rail to Veolia Transport Sydney, a subsidiary of Veolia Transdev, who operated them since 1998. After the government takeover of Metro Transport Sydney, Veolia Transport Sydney remained as the operator of monorail and light rail. Veolia Transport Sydney later renamed to Transdev Sydney on 1 July 2013. The monorail was also shut down on the same day. Assets Until the government takeover in 2012, Metro Transport Sydney owned: *Sydney Monorail, originally known as Metro Monorail in early MTS years, closed on 30 June 2013. *Metro Light Rail, the light rail line now known as the Inner West Light Rail or Dulwich Hill Line. 100px Both Metro Monorail and Metro Light Rail had similar logos to Metro Transport Sydney, with all of them bearing the letter \\"M\\", but with the right leg of the letter containing a different word (either \\"Transport\\", \\"Light Rail\\" or \\"Monorail\\"). After the Metro Monorail was rebranded Sydney Monorail, the \\"M\\" logo was replaced with a logo of a monorail vehicle. Metro Transport Sydney advocated for a light rail extension to Circular Quay between the late 1990s and the late 2000s, but did not gain state government support. After a change of state government in the 2011 state election, this extension has been built as part of the separate CBD and South East Light Rail, with the CBD section to Circular Quay completed in December 2019. History=Sydney Light Rail Company In March 1994, the Sydney Light Rail Company (SLRC) was formed. It was owned by Australian Infrastructure Fund (39%), Utility Trust of Australia (39%) and Legal & General (22%)\\"Sydney's new light rail system\\" Railway Digest September 1997 page 14 and was awarded a 30-year concession to operate the Sydney Light Rail (SLR) system until February 2028 when ownership would pass to the State Government. The contract gave the company significant control over the commercial arrangements relating to future extensions or interconnecting lines. SLRC contracted operation of the line to TNT Transit Systems, which also owned the Sydney Monorail. Acquisition of the monorail After TNT was purchased by PTT in January 1997 and merged to form TNT Post Group in 1998, TNT decided to dispose of its businesses not centered on mail and logistics services, including the Sydney monorail. SLRC formed a joint venture with CGEA Transport named CGEA Transport Sydney to purchase TNT Transit Systems and TNT Harbourlink on 10 August 1998. The share composition of the joint venture were CGEA Transport (51%) and SLRC (49%, with 19% Australian Infrastructure Fund, 19% Utility Trust of Australia and 11% Legal & General). This purchase resulted in: *CGEA Transport taking control of the operation of the monorail as the new owner of the monorail *CGEA Transport being awarded the light rail operation contract by the SLRC as the owner of the incumbent operator TNT Transit Systems. SLRC remains the owner of the light rail. As a result, the operations of both the light rail and the monorail came under the same company (CGEA). In early 2001, Connex (renamed from CGEA Transport in 1999) sold its share of the monorail to the constituents of SLRC, bringing the monorail and light rail under the common ownership of Australian Infrastructure Fund, Utility Trust of Australia and Legal & General. Due to SLRC and CGEA Transport Sydney having the same shareholders, they were subsequently combined to form Metro Transport Sydney. It continued to contract day-to-day operations of the monorail and light rail to Connex, rebranded Veolia Transport Sydney in 2006. By 2005, Metro Transport Sydney was owned by three companies: Australia Infrastructure Fund, Utility Trust of Australia and Colonial First State. Government ownership Transport for NSW, the transport agency of the Government of New South Wales, established the \\"MTS Holding Company\\" on 12 March 2012. It purchased Metro Transport Sydney and its subsidiaries on 23 March 2012 for $19.8 million, which brought the company under the control of Transport for NSW and the government. The purchase removed the contractual restrictions on expanding the light rail network and allowed the government to dismantle the monorail, assisting its plans to redevelop the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre. The monorail was shut down on 30 June 2013. Cessation of the Metro Transport brand The day after the monorail was shut down, on 1 July 2013, the Metro Transport Sydney brand, along with its subsidiary Metro Light Rail, was phased out as part of a broader rebranding and reorganisation of public transport services in New South Wales. The light rail was also placed under direct control of the government. Both SLRC and Metro Transport Sydney Pty Ltd were deregistered on 17 July 2013. The process of shutting down Metro Transport Sydney and transferring assets to Transport for NSW was completed in September 2014 with the deregistration of MTS Holding Company.

It is based on the Japanese book Karate Baka Ichidai which is a fictionalized account of karate competitor Choi Yeung-Eui (ÏµúÏòÅÏùò, Â¥îÊ∞∏ÂÆú) who went to Japan during World War II to become a fighter pilot but found a very different path instead. He changed his name to Masutatsu Oyama (Â§ßÂ±±ÂÄçÈÅî) and went across the country, defeating martial artists one after another. This film concentrates on the period when he is still young, and developing his famous karate style, Kyokushin. The film was the seventh highest grossing Korean film of 2004 with 2,346,446 admissions sold nationwide.http://www.koreanfilm.org/films2004.html#boxoffice Plot At the tail-end of World War II, Choi Bae-dal is a young Korean man who longs to be able to fly fighter planes. Stowing away to Japan in order to join their air force, Bae-dal's first experience of the country is when a con-man tries to steal his money. Bae-dal discovers that the man is a fellow Korean called Chun-bae (Jung Tae-woo), who has survived the harsh treatment of Koreans in Japan by turning to petty crime. With their different motives: Bae-dal driven by desire for action and Chun-bae needing to escape from some gangsters, the two Koreans stow away in a truck to the air force training camp. The commander in charge of the camp is a pompous imperialist called Kato (Masaya Kato). Having mistreated the two Koreans, he is amused by Bae-dal's fighting spirit and says that if Bae-dal can beat him with his inferior \\"foreign\\" fighting style (Taekkyon), he will release them. The two men fight with Kato easily defeating Bae-dal, but an American attack on the airforce base allows Bae-dal and Chun-bae to escape. Later, Bae-dal is found helping Chun-bae to run a pachinko stall in a Japanese market place. When local gangsters try to take protection money from Chun-bae, Bae-dal tries to defend him but is beaten up and humiliated by the gangsters. His ordeal is ended by the intervention of Bum-soo (Jung Doo-hong), a martial arts expert from his home town who had also emigrated to Japan. Bum-soo invites Bae-dal back to the circus where he, and many fellow Korean immigrants, work and where he is attempting to build a decent standard of living for his countrymen. After some persuasion, he agrees to teach Bae-dal some of his more sophisticated fighting style. Meanwhile, Bae-dal has taken to working as a rickshaw driver, honing his fighting skills by defending Japanese women from the rapacious advances of American servicemen. His success at protecting the women makes him something of a local hero, although his real identity is not known. One of the women he protects is the beautiful Yoko (Aya Hirayama), with whom he strikes up a romantic relationship. When Bum-soo is killed by local gangsters, the Koreans from the compound vow revenge and attack the Japanese gangs. The fight ends abruptly for Bae-dal when he is knocked unconscious by a blow to the head. Bae-dal, vowing to never again lose a fight, retreats to the mountains where, living in his karate gi, he trains day and night; running in the mountains, lifting tree trunks and using makeshift training equipment to harden his body and fighting spirit through austerity. Returning from the mountains, Bae-dal takes a Japanese name: Masutatsu Oyama, and sets about challenging the best fighters Japan has to offer. Wearing his ragged karate gi and looking like a cave-man with his unkempt appearance, Oyama challenges the first dojo he passes. He defeats every fighter in the dojo - often with only a single strike. As word of his notoriety spreads, Oyama's actions come to the attention of the head of the Japan Karate Association - the former Air Force camp commander Kato. Kato is hugely offended that a foreigner would not only try to learn Japanese martial arts, but would consider himself worthy to beat Japanese fighters. Nevertheless, Oyama continues to defeat every fighter that Japan has to offer, including competitors in karate, judo, ninjutsu, aikido, and kobudo, becoming a sensation in the Japanese media. Oyama explains to Yoko that, although he is scared of dying, he is more scared of living as a cripple, and this is why he is willing to sacrifice anything to win. When the organization sends one of his followers to challenge and kill Oyama, the agent is instead killed by Oyama. Learning that the man he killed had a wife and son, Oyama feels a great deal of guilt for his actions and tracks down the family to apologise and offer to work for them to make up for killing the father of the household. Oyama surrenders his uniform to the wife, vowing to never again fight in martial art duels. Although initially angry and unaccepting of Oyama's offer, after fulfilling the son's wish of being carried to the top of the nearby mountain to view the sunrise, he eventually convinces them that he is a man of honour and not a violent thug. The wife asks Oyama to take back his uniform and become the best fighter in Japan. Returning to the city, Oyama finds that Kato's martial arts association has threatened his own family (Kato is not involved) and demanded a challenge between Kato and Oyama. Dressing in his weathered gi once again, Oyama treks out to the countryside location where Kato is waiting for him. Easily defeating Kato's henchmen, Oyama then faces a final showdown with Kato himself. Although it is clear that Kato would like to see Oyama dead, Kato's ankle is broken after receiving a kick in the fight sequence. When Kato stands up, he falls to a one-knee-down position, Oyama shows mercy to Kato, by stopping 2 cm short of punching him squarely between the eyes, defeating him in combat but not killing him. At the end of the movie, Oyama is shown fighting with a bull, grasping the horns and digging into the ground to stop him, and finally delivering a bone-shattering chop to the center of the top of the head.

Life Flight flies into 12th floor of the John S. Dunn Heli-Stop atop Memorial Hermann Hospital-Texas Medical Center. It was founded in 1976. History Service began on August 1, 1976 as the second helicopter air medical program in the United States of America. The founder, Dr. James H. \\"Red\\" Duke, Jr., was the medical director for Life Flight from its inception until his death August 25, 2015. To date, Life Flight has flown more than 120,000 patient missions. Life Flight is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems. The first helicopter utilized on a Life Flight mission was the French-built SA 319B, also known as the Alouette III. The Alouette served the program well, but was eventually replaced by a newer aircraft, the AS 355 Ecureuil 2, also known as ‚ÄúTwinStar.‚Äù The AS 355 boasted many improvements in power, speed, cabin space and stability and was equipped with two turbine engines that greatly improved the safety of operations. The TwinStar served with Life Flight until the acquisition of the BK 117 helicopter. The BK 117 was built as a joint venture between Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB) and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The aircraft is particularly special because of its layout, which allows for complete use of the cabin area. It has no structural beams, or pillars, blocking the cabin space, and it also has large rear ‚Äúclamshell‚Äù doors to use for loading and unloading patient stretchers. With the addition of the BK117, Life Flight has been able to conduct many specialized transports, including neonatal transport, intra-aortic balloon pump patients, and double patient loads from the same scene. In addition, Life Flight operated a Bo 105 helicopter, also built by MBB. It featured dual engines, double patient load capacity and a high skid configuration to improve safety around the tail rotor. In 2007, Life Flight purchased 6 new EC 145 twin-engine helicopters that replaced the 4 that were in use. One is stationed near the Port of Houston to better serve that region and one will be dedicated to pediatric transport. Each Life Flight helicopter can carry up to two patients. Life Flight has experienced only one fatal crash killing the pilot John Pittman, paramedic Charles R. \\"Mac\\" Atteberry and flight nurse Lynn Ethridge. It happened in 1999 and resulted from helicopter manufacturing flaws in the previously used BK-117 helicopter model ‚Äî the tension torsion strap unraveled, sending the aircraft to the ground. Operations Life Flight operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year within a 150-mile radius of Memorial Hermann- Texas Medical Center, performing more than 3,000 missions each year. This service area includes Southeast Texas and Western Louisiana. The John S. Dunn Helistop is one of the busiest helipads in the world. Crew Life Flight's crew is made up of helicopter pilots, flight nurses, flight paramedics, and flight mechanics. The aviation and medical staff have over 250 combined years of medical transport experience. The medical crew continue their training and education with recurrent skills training and maintain Certified Flight Registered Nurse and Certified Flight Paramedic credentials. Helicopter mechanics are factory trained by Eurocopter, attend manufacturer's training on Turbomeca engines, and are Airframe & Powerplant Certified. Pilots are required to have thousands of hours of flight time and Airline Transport Pilot credentialing, the highest level of aircraft pilot certificate/license, is preferred. Current bases Life Flight operates out of five bases in the greater Houston area. * North Base (Hooks): David Wayne Hooks Memorial Airport 1st through the 15th of the month * North Base (Woodlands): Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Hospital 16th through 30th of the month * East Base: Baytown Airport * South Base: Pearland Regional Airport * West Base South: Memorial Hermann Sugarland Hospital 1st through the 15th of the month * West Base North: Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital 16th through 30th of the month * Central Base: John S.

G. Wells and the screenplay of the 1960 film of the same name by David Duncan. Arnold Leibovit served as executive producer and Simon Wells, the great-grandson of the original author, served as director. The film stars Guy Pearce, Orlando Jones, Samantha Mumba, Mark Addy, and Jeremy Irons, and includes a cameo by Alan Young, who also appeared in the 1960 film adaptation. The film is set in New York City instead of London, and contains new story elements not present in the original novel nor the 1960 film adaptation, including a romantic backstory, a new scenario about how civilization was destroyed, and several new characters such as an artificially intelligent hologram and a Morlock leader. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $123 million worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup (John M. Elliot Jr. and Barbara Lorenz) at the 75th Academy Awards, but lost to Frida. Plot In 1899, Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is an inventor teaching at Columbia University in New York City. Unlike his friend David Philby, Alexander would rather do pure research than work in the world of business. After a mugger kills his fianc√©e, Emma, he devotes himself to building a time machine that will allow him to travel back in time to save her. When he completes the machine in 1903, he travels back to 1899 and prevents her murder, only to see her killed again when a horseless carriage frightens the horses of a horse-drawn vehicle. Alexander realizes that any attempt to save Emma will result in her death through other circumstances. Distraught, Alexander travels to 2030 to discover whether science has been able to solve his question of how to change the past. At the New York Public Library, a holographic sentient librarian called Vox 114 insists that time travel to the past is impossible and is the realm of fictional authors such as Isaac Asimov and H.G. Wells. Alexander looks up himself and learns that he was reported missing in 1903 and dismissed as a crackpot. Alexander travels to 2037, when the accidental destruction of the Moon by the lunar colonists' demolition team has begun rendering the Earth virtually uninhabitable. While restarting the time machine, he is knocked unconscious and travels to the year 802,701 before reawakening. When Alexander comes to, he learns that Earth has now healed and the human race has reverted to a primitive dystopianThe Time Machine Review. scifimoviezone.com (Unknown publish date).

Alexander is nursed back to health by a woman named Mara, one of the few Eloi who speak English. He observes the broken moon and suggests that maybe his teachings led to this future. One night, Alexander and Mara's young brother Kalen dream of a frightening, jagged-toothed face and a creature calling their name. Alexander informs Mara of the dream, and she tells him they all have that dream and notices that his watch is missing. The next day, the Eloi are attacked and Mara is dragged underground by ape-like monsters called \\"Morlocks\\" that hunt the Eloi for food. In order to rescue her, Kalen leads Alexander to Vox 114, which is still functional after 800,671 years. After learning from Vox how to find the Morlocks, Alexander enters their underground lair through an opening that resembles the face in his nightmare. He is captured and thrown into an area where Mara sits in a cage. Alexander meets the √úber-Morlock, who explains that Morlocks are the descendants of the humans who went underground after the Moon broke apart, while the Eloi are descended from those who remained on the surface. The √úber-Morlocks are a caste of telepaths who rule the other Morlocks. The √úber-Morlock explains that Alexander cannot alter Emma's fate, because her death is what drove him to build the time machine in the first place: saving her would be a virtual impossibility due to temporal paradox. He then reveals that the Morlocks have brought the time machine underground, and tells Alexander to return home after he gives Alexander his watch and the answer of why he cannot change the past. Alexander gets into the machine, but pulls the √úber-Morlock in with him, carrying them into the future as they fight. The √úber-Morlock dies by rapidly aging when Alexander pushes him outside of the machine's temporal bubble. Alexander arrives at the year 635,427,810, revealing a harsh, rust-colored sky over a wasteland of Morlock caves. Accepting that he cannot save Emma, Alexander travels back to rescue Mara. After freeing her, he starts the time machine and jams its gears with his watch, creating a violent distortion in time. Pursued by the Morlocks, Alexander and Mara escape to the surface as the time distortion explodes, killing the Morlocks and destroying their caves along with the time machine. Alexander begins a new life with Mara and the Eloi, while Vox 114 becomes a teacher to the Eloi children. Back in 1903, Philby and Alexander's housekeeper Mrs. Watchit are in his laboratory discussing his absence. Philby tells Mrs. Watchit he is glad that Alexander has gone to a place where he can find peace, then tells her that he would like to hire her as a housekeeper, which she accepts until Alexander returns. Mrs. Watchit bids Alexander farewell and Philby leaves, looking toward the laboratory affectionately, then throws his bowler hat away in tribute to Alexander's distaste for conformity.

Production The film was a co-production of DreamWorks and Warner Bros. in association with Arnold Leibovit Entertainment who obtained the rights to the George Pal original Time Machine 1960 and collectively negotiated the deal that made it possible for both Warner Bros and DreamWorks to make the film. Director Gore Verbinski was brought in to take over the last 18 days of shooting, as Wells was suffering from \\"extreme exhaustion\\". Wells returned for post-production.Time Machine director bows out Special effects The Morlocks were depicted using actors in costumes wearing animatronic masks created by Stan Winston Studio. For scenes in which they run on all fours faster than humanly possible, Industrial Light & Magic created CGI versions of the creatures. Many of the time traveling scenes were entirely computer generated, including a 33-second shot in the workshop where the time machine is located. The camera pulls out, traveling through New York City and then into space, past the ISS, and ends with a space plane landing at the Moon to reveal Earth's future lunar colonies. Plants and buildings are shown springing up and then being replaced by new growth in a constant cycle. In later shots, the effects team used an erosion algorithm to digitally simulate the Earth's landscape changing through the centuries. For some of the lighting effects used for the digital time bubble around the time machine, ILM developed an extended-range color format, which they named rgbe (red, green, blue, and an exponent channel) (See Paul E. Debevec and Jitendra Malik, \\"Recovering High Dynamic Range Radiance Maps from Photographs, Siggraph Proceedings, 1997). The film's original release date was December 2001, but it was moved to March 2002 because a scene was removed from the Moon destruction sequence showing pieces of the Moon crashing into buildings in New York because it looked too similar visually to the September 11 attacks. Soundtrack A full score was written by Klaus Badelt, with the recognizable theme being the track \\"I Don't Belong Here\\", which was later used in the 2008 Discovery Channel Mini series When We Left Earth. In 2002, the film's soundtrack won the World Soundtrack Award for Discovery of the Year. Critical reception The film holds a 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 150 reviews with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads \\"This Machine has all the razzle-dazzles of modern special effects, but the movie takes a turn for the worst when it switches from a story about lost love to a confusing action-thriller\\". William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, who was somewhat positive about the film, wrote that it lost some of the simplicity and charm of the 1960 George Pal film by adding characters such as Jeremy Irons' \\"√ºber-morlock\\". He praised actor Guy Pearce's \\"more eccentric\\" time traveler and his transition from an awkward intellectual to a man of action. Victoria Alexander of Filmsinreview.com wrote that \\"The Time Machine is a loopy love story with good special effects but a storyline that's logically incomprehensible,\\" via RottenTomatoes.com. noting some \\"plot holes\\" having to deal with Hartdegen and his machine's cause-and- effect relationship with the outcome of the future. Jay Carr of the Boston Globe wrote: \\"The truth is that Wells wasn't that penetrating a writer when it came to probing character or the human heart. His speculations and gimmicks were what propelled his books. The film, given the chance to deepen its source, instead falls back on its gadgets.\\" Some critics praised the special effects, declaring the film visually impressive and colorful, while others thought the effects were poor. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times scorned the film, and found the Morlock animation cartoonish and unrealistic, because of their manner of leaping and running. Ebert notes the contrast in terms of the social/racial representation of the attractive Eloi between the two films... between the \\"dusky sun people\\" of this version and the Nordic race in the George Pal film. Aside from its vision of the future, the film's recreation of New York at the turn of the century won it some praise. Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle writes \\"The far future may be awesome to consider, but from period detail to matters of the heart, this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past.\\" ReferencesExternal links   * Category:2002 films Category:2002 science fiction films Category:2000s dystopian films Category:2002 science fiction action films Category:2000s science fiction adventure films Category:American films Category:American science fiction action films Category:American science fiction adventure films Category:American alternate history films Category:American film remakes Category:English-language films Category:The Time Machine Category:Apocalyptic films Category:DreamWorks Pictures films Category:Dystopian films Category:Fictional-language films Category:Films about time travel Category:Films based on works by H.

Its boundaries are defined by Fernleigh Road to the south, Glenfield Road to the west, Coleman Street to the north and to the east by Willans Hill. Turvey Park is characterised by single detached dwellings, constructed in the period from the early 1900s through to the 1960s. These dwellings vary from the very substantial, as found in parts of Coleman Street and Grandview Parade, to the brick bungalows of the northern end of the suburb between Urana and Coleman Streets, to modest public housing, and a mixture of brick and fibro and weatherboard cottages at the southern end of the suburb. Another feature of Turvey Park are many corner shops, such on the corner of Heath and Urana Street, the corner of Norman and Coleman Streets, and the Corner of Bourke and Urana Streets. Turvey Park was named after the property \\"Turvey Park\\" established by Thomas Turvey (died 14 January 1889), a licensee and store owner. A large family vault on the property was moved to the Church of England proportion of the Wagga Wagga Monumental Cemetery to allow for the construction of the intersection of Mitchelmore St and Hodson Ave in 1941. A commemorative plaque now marks the vicinity of the original site. A number of Wagga Wagga facilities are located in Turvey Park including the Wagga Wagga Showground, Turvey Park Public School, Wagga Wagga High School, Kildare Catholic College, Henschke Primary School, Wagga Wagga TAFE, 2AAA FM Studios, Hopwood Park Tennis Club, Gissing Oval, a Fire and Rescue NSW Station, the Riverina Juvenile Justice Centre, the Kay Hull Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Charles Sturt University, Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church and St Paul's Anglican Church. The Turvey Tops shopping centre, despite taking its name from the suburb, is actually located in the adjoining suburb of Mt. Austin. A number of Wagga Wagga sporting clubs have their origins in Turvey Park, and share the Turvey Park name, including the Turvey Park Bulldogs of the Riverina Football League (Australian Rules), the former Turvey Park Lions of Group 9 Rugby League (later merging with Wagga Wagga Magpies to create South City Bulls), and the Turvey Park Softball Club. Former Canterbury-Bankstown, New South Wales and Australian Rugby League player Steve Mortimer is nicknamed Turvey after the Turvey Park Rugby League club for whom he played for growing up in Wagga Wagga.  History  The suburb was added to the municipality in 1939, however the subdivision of lands and the construction of dwellings commenced well before this, in the early 1900s. The annexure of the suburb followed long campaigns by Turvey Park residents for services available in central Wagga Wagga such as water supply and electricity. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s the New South Wales Housing Commission erected public housing within the suburb, particularly around the Blamey Street and Fernleigh Road areas, with allocation of homes determined by ballot, with a large percentage of the homes being reserved for returned servicemen. A number of these properties remain as Housing NSW social housing, whilst others have been transferred into private ownership. In the late 1940s, Wagga Wagga Municipal Council carried out a replanning exercise in the southern part of Turvey Park in an area bounded by Urana Street, Macleay Street, Fernleigh Road, and Heath Street. Existing narrow laneways were widened to full width streets creating what are now Rudd, Croaker, Heydon, Hodson and Mair Streets, which facilitated more intensive subdivision of the area, by allowing the rear of the lots fronting wider, formal streets (such as Mitchelmore, Heath, Urana and Macleay Streets, as well as Fernleigh Road) to be excised. Remnants of this exercise remain, where full widening of the laneways was not possible due to dwellings already being in place, such as Heydon Avenue at the corner with Heath Street, and Rudd Street at its intersection with Blamey Street. Initially, Turvey Park housed an annex of South Wagga Public School, which opened in 1948, and which was located at the Wagga Showgrounds in Bourke Street. A public school was granted to Turvey Park in 1949, on a site in Halloran Street, with Turvey Park Public School being officially open in 1952. Classes, continued at the showground site, however, with construction of the new school continuing for some time before all year groups relocated to the current site. The school was constructed as a 'demonstration school' to be used in the training of teacher's at the nearby Wagga Wagga Teacher's College (later Charles Sturt University South Campus), which is also located in Turvey Park.

Song history #41 was originally written by Dave Matthews as a reply to lawsuits brought by Ross Hoffman, a former associate and manager of the band. Hoffman owned rights to a number of the band's songs in the early 1990s; however, due to creative differences, he was eventually fired by the band, and the band's present manager, Coran Capshaw, was hired. As an owner of the band's songs, Hoffman felt he deserved a share of the profits, which later caused a legal dispute between him and the band. Matthews wrote the song based upon the broken-hearted feelings he was experiencing as he was going through legal disputes with a former mentor of his. On April 7, 1995, #41 debuted under the title \\"41 Police.\\" As the band had not come up with an official title for the song, the number 41 was used as it was the band's 41st song, and it sounded similar to a song by The Police, \\"Bring on the Night\\". The original performance was played at Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke University, and lasted around nine minutes. This version of the song was played a total of 19 times before evolving into the #41 that exists today. In fall 1995, the song was officially named #41 after several lyric and chord changes were made. This song was the band's fourth \\"numbered\\" song at the time, following #34, #36, and #40. After \\"41 Police\\" became a defunct song, the first performance of the #41 live was played on October 4, 1995, at the Tinker Street Caf√© in Woodstock, NY. The show featured frequent collaborator Tim Reynolds on the electric guitar. In the fall of 1995 the band, along with Reynolds, recorded the song in the studio for the album Crash with producer Steve Lillywhite. On the album, a flute bridge by LeRoi Moore segues the song into the following track, \\"Say Goodbye\\", and was often played in this fashion during live shows after the song's debut. During that year, #41 became the most played song on their summer tour. In December 2000, lyrics from the band's song \\"Everyday\\", from the album of the same name, were added during the outro of the song, hence the creation of the \\"Everyday outro,\\" which is often sung by Matthews during live performances. Live collaborations Throughout the years that the song has been performed live, the band has featured many guests to join them on stage and jam out the song, usually averaging around 15‚Äì20 minutes of play time, however sometimes longer. On New Year's Eve 1996, the band featured guests B√©la Fleck, Victor Wooten, Futureman and Jeff Coffin, who make up the jazz fusion band, B√©la Fleck and the Flecktones. During the live performance of #41, an interpolation of the Flecktones' song \\"Sojourn of Arjuna\\" was played live for the first time. Interpolations of \\"Sojourn of Arjuna,\\" featured on the Flecktones' album, Left of Cool, would be played during future live performances of #41 featuring guest appearances by Flecktones members. (This began to occur more frequently during the band's 2008 summer tour after longtime Flecktones member Jeff Coffin replaced the late LeRoi Moore as the band's saxophonist.) Since the song's debut, Dave Matthews Band has played #41 live over 500 times, occasionally featuring the Flecktones as musical guests. Currently, the longest live performance of #41 is also the band's longest performance of any song, and was played on April 20, 2002, at the former Corel Centre in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The jam featured all of the Flecktones and lasted for 32 minutes and 3 seconds. This performance was later released on the bonus disc for The Best of What's Around Vol. 1.

He was known particularly for his operas, the best known of which are Lizzie Borden, Hello Out There! and The Sweet Bye and Bye. Early life Born in Muncie, Indiana, Beeson began with music when he started piano lessons with Luella Weimer in 1928, but it was not until 1933 that he began to compose. He decided to become an \\"opera-composer\\" after being influenced by Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. From 1936 until 1939, he switched piano teachers and was with Percival Owen during this period of time. In 1938 he received certificates with first class honors in piano and theory from the Conservatory of Music at the University of Toronto, a very well earned accomplishment at the age of 21. From 1944 to 1945 he had private studies with B√©la Bart√≥k in New York City. At this time he was also associating with the Columbia University Opera Workshop and the opera productions of Columbia Theatre Associates. This led to the first performance of his music in New York City. Throughout 1946 and 1947 Beeson was adapting Paul Goodman's play and composing the music for Jonah as well as writing and performing the Fifth Sonata on piano. Beeson won the Prix de Rome and Fulbright scholarship which allowed him to live in Rome from 1948‚Äì1950. Career During this time, he completed Jonah and then returned to teaching and opera productions at Columbia. The year of 1953/1954, he adapted Saroyan's play as a libretto and composed Hello Out There as well as superintending its first performance. From 1955 to 1958 he collaborated with Kenward Elmslie on The Sweet Bye and Bye, first performed at the Juilliard School. From 1958 to 1959 he wrote three orchestral works and numerous smaller pieces. During 1965 and 1967 he recorded and published Lizzie Borden, which was televised by NET Opera and revived by the New York City Opera. That same year, he also became MacDowell Professor of Music at Columbia. From 1981 to 1991 he wrote Cyrano, a heroic comedy in music, with Sheldon Harnick. He then chose early retirement from Columbia in 1988, but returned as a member of the Society of Senior Scholars. In May 2010, he was awarded a Letter of Distinction from the American Music Center. His notable students include Charles Wuorinen, John Kander, Phillip Ramey, Alice Shields, Joan Tower, Harvey Sollberger, Michael Rosenzweig, Bright Sheng, Mark Birnbaum, and Richard Einhorn. Beeson died June 6, 2010, in New York City, New York.Sequenza21 Works=Operas *Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines (1975), a romantic comedy in music in three acts.

With actress Lezlie Deane of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare as a member, Fem2Fem were the first and (so-far only) openly lesbian pop group to chart, although the band did contain straight women in addition to open homosexuals. But only some of the members of Fem2Fem were lesbians, and according to Michelle Crispin their intentions at the beginning were to promote a healthy view of sexuality with their music, regardless of sexual orientation. However, an appearance by the band in the December 1993 issue of Playboy magazine and the non-political nature of their sapphic lyrics led to criticism by some in the LGBT community that the band was trying to make a fast buck off playing to the prurient interests of a heterosexual male audience.
