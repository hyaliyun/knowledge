The DRC has one of the lowest rates of access to clean drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa and the world. Only 46 percent of the population had access to an improved drinking water source in 2012. Furthermore, the sanitation coverage was estimated at only 31 percent in 2012. Up to date and accurate information on water supply and sanitation services in the DRC is scarce. As a result of inadequate water supply and sanitation services, many inhabitants are suffering from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, typhoid, and cholera. Location of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa The current water crisis is a result of the deteriorated state of the water infrastructure due to underinvestment in the water sector and conflict- related destruction as well as the rapid growth of the population, which was estimated at 4 percent in urban areas and 2.5 percent in rural areas by the World Bank in 2009. Overall, the DRC's water supply and sanitation sector is characterized by several overlapping and conflicting institutional jurisdictions. Therefore, the water crisis in the DRC can be categorized as an economic water scarcity problem, hindering development in the country. Article 48 of the 2006 Constitution of the DRC recognizes the human right to water. The rehabilitation and development of the water sector is a priority to which the national government committed itself in the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategies and to which it agreed as part of the international framework of the UN Millennium Development Goals.  Freshwater resources and water supply  Aerial view of the Congo River The DRC is the most water-rich country in Africa. It accounts for approximately 52 percent of Africa's surface water reserves and 23 percent of Africa's internal renewable water resources. The internal renewable freshwater resources per capita were estimated at 14,406 m3/person/year in 2008. This value is significantly higher than the internationally recognized water sufficiency limit of 1,700 m3/person/year. The DRC has an average annual precipitation of around 1,543 mm/year, varying in space and time (800-1,800 mm/year). Furthermore, the DRC possesses considerable water autonomy since 70 percent of its total renewable water resources are generated internally from precipitation. The abundant water resources in the DRC are linked to the vast forest coverage, which extends over 155.5 million ha. Congo River drainage basin Rivers and lakes comprise approximately 3.5 percent of the DRC's surface area. The surface water resources of the DRC are dominated by the Congo River and its tributaries. With a mean flow of around 41,000 m3/s, the Congo River has the second largest discharge volume in the world. The Congo River basin accounts for 98 percent of the country's surface area and provides the country with one of the most extensive river networks in the world. The quality of surface waters is generally very good, with the exception of localized pollution hotspots in urban centres and near mining operations. The high water quality is mostly a result of the high dilution capacity of the river network, the low population density and the dominance of human activities that belong to the subsistence type, having only a minor impact on the environment. Groundwater is estimated to account for approximately 47 percent of the DRC's internal renewable water resources. Springs located in dense forests are the main source of water supply for the majority of the population. However, information on extent and quality of groundwater resources and springs in the DRC is scarce. Simple, capped springheads are commonly used for water supply in dispersed villages and peri-urban areas. Large-scale water supply from springs through distribution networks is used in many cities, including Beni, Bunia, Lisala, Lubumbashi, Kisangani and Mbuji-Mayi. Water supply from deep-drilled wells is limited to a small percentage of the population. Most of the approximately 1,000 wells were constructed between the 1960s and 1990s and have yields between 15 and 80 m3/h. Hand and mechanical pump wells and dug wells account for around 10 percent of the drinking water supply. In 2015, there were still around 1 million people without access to \\"improved\\" water. In 2015, 76% of the population had access to an \\"improved\\" water source, 96% and 40% in urban and rural areas, respectively.WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation  Water use  Water withdrawals per person were estimated at 7 m3/person/year in 2014, which indicate only a small level of water resource mobilization (less than 1 percent). Water use per capita in the DRC is considerably lower than in many arid Sahel countries, which experience a physical water scarcity problem. Water is mainly utilized for domestic purposes, comprising 52 percent of total water withdrawals in the DRC. Agriculture accounts for 32 percent of total water withdrawals, followed by industry with 16 percent. Fisheries, hydropower generation and navigation are other important water uses in the DRC, which are typically not included in water use statistics. Water withdrawal in the DRC is projected to increase significantly by 2025. Domestic use, agriculture and industry are expected to grow by 470 percent, 375 percent and 225 percent, respectively. However, water consumption by 2025 would still comprise only 0.16 percent of DRC's internal renewable freshwater resources.  Water sector structure  The development and rehabilitation of the water sector is a priority to which the national government committed itself in the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (DSCRP I and DSCRP II) and to which it agreed as part of the international framework of the UN Millennium Development Goals. Water sector governance in the DRC is structurally weak and characterized by overlapping and conflicting institutional mandates. Implementation capacity is the major limiting factor for development in the water sector. Large aid flows have been mobilized for the rehabilitation of water supply infrastructure, but due to institutional and administrative dysfunction, weak capacity as well as lacking supporting infrastructure, logisitics and economic services, the use of funds has been significantly slowed down. In public projects, utilization of investments is generally less than 50 percent. Moreover, further financial investments are necessary for a comprehensive reform of the water sector. = Institutional Framework = Management of the water sector in the DRC are divided among several ministries and organizations. The Ministry of Planning has the responsibility for the elaboration and monitoring of the defined Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategies. Under the National Water and Sanitation Committee (CNAEA), it has the authority for policy development and monitoring, coordination of ministries and cooperation with development partners in the water sector. The state-owned cooperation REGIDESO is responsible for providing water supply services in urban areas. It operates under the administrative and financial supervision of the Ministry of State Portfolio and under the technical supervision of the Ministry of Energy. The national rural waterworks service, SNHR, reports to the Ministry of Rural Development and is responsible for the development of rural and peri-urban drinking water supply services. The Ministry of Public Health is also involved in the rural water sector through the Villages Assainis and √âcoles Assainies programs, which are supported by UNICEF and designed to engage rural communities in the development of improved drinking water and sanitation services. = International assistance and NGOs = International assistance plays an important role in the development of the DRC's water sector. International aid is estimated at $62 million per year which corresponds to approximately 95 percent of total investments. Funded projects are mostly directed towards reaching the UN Millennium Development Goals and the national Poverty Reduction Strategies. International investments are targeted equally at the urban and rural water sectors. In peri-urban and rural areas, international assistance comprises nearly all of the total investments. As part of the humanitarian and emergency relief efforts during the conflict time span, international and national NGOs established a multitude of water supply service projects in the DRC. NGOs provide essential water supply services in remote areas neglected by governmental efforts. However, they are often poorly coordinated and focus on activities that are designed to immediately improve local water supply, but lacking sufficient management structures to maintain the infrastructure in the future. = Water sector reform = The water sector is subject to ongoing reorganization by a government reform initialized with the help of international development partners in 2006, especially the German GIZ water reform project. In 2010, a comprehensive Water Code geared towards national development goals was adopted by the government of the DRC, which provides a national legislative framework for sustainable water management. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) is a fundamental principle stated in the Water Code, which aims at the establishment of a structured process to reconcile the interests of the different stakeholders. Key concepts include a land zoning system to ensure protection of strategic drinking water resources and their watersheds, user pays principle, polluter pays principle, precautionary principle, subsidiary principle and public dialogue and consultation. The government of the DRC also released an action plan for the further development of the drinking water sector by 2020. The aim of the action plan is to ensure the implementation of the water sector reform. Therefore, it also serves to harmonise interventions by international donors and to safeguard the orientation of their activities around the national agenda. Structural transformation of the water sector is a key aspect of the water reform. It includes the replacement of the CNAEA by a National Water Council, which will have the mandate to lead the whole water sector based on an IWRM approach, the establishment of Provincial Water Councils, Local Water Committees and Water User Associations as part of the decentralization approach, and the creation of agencies which are responsible for management of water resources at drainage basin and sub-basin levels. Furthermore, REGIDESO is subject to transformation to a commercial public enterprise.  Key issues in the water sector  Only 46 percent of the DRC's population had access to an improved drinking water source in 2012, compared to an average of 60 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sanitation coverage was estimated at only 31 percent in 2012. The lack of safe drinking water and poor sanitary conditions pose a major risk to public health. The mortality of children under the age of five was estimated at 11.9 percent in 2015, compared to 9.2 percent in Sub- Saharan Africa, with a high prevalence of waterborne diseases like diarrhea, cholera, dysentery and typhoid fever. There is a major geographic discrepancy in drinking water availability, with 79 percent of the urban population having access to drinking water against 29 percent of the rural and peri-urban population. However, in many areas of the DRC, access to safe drinking water was less than 5 percent in 2011. The level of access to improved sanitation facilities is very low, but comparable in urban (33 percent) and rural areas (29 percent). Financial investments are significantly skewed towards urban areas, with 85 percent of total funding designated for development of the urban water sector, although the rural population still comprised 58 percent of the total population in 2014. = Urban and peri-urban water sector = Although access to safe drinking water is significantly lower in rural areas than in urban areas in the DRC, the actual number of people without water access is increasing at a significantly higher rate in urban areas because of faster population growth. The average annual growth rate of the urban population over the time period from 2010 to 2015 was estimated at 4 percent, compared to a population growth rate of 1.9 percent in rural areas. The population living in urban areas is estimated at 42 percent. The rapid population growth in urban areas is associated with the expansion of the urban sprawl and poses major difficulties in establishing adequate water infrastructure. Many peri-urban watersheds are being impacted through uncontrolled expansion for housing construction, agriculture and firewood supply. REGIDESO's water supply services suffer from the degradation of its infrastructure due to lack of electricity, absence of new investments and maintenance. Years of armed conflict, poor leadership, weak governance, depleted finances mostly due to nonpayment of water bills by the government and non-profitable tariff policy, as well as lagging operational performance of REGIDESO have led to the deteriorated state of urban water supply services. Urban water coverage is significantly heterogeneous. Over 85 percent of the urban water connections are located in four provinces: Kinshasa, Bas Congo, Katanga and South Kivu. Furthermore, funding is heavily skewed towards the city of Kinshasa, receiving almost 40 percent of total investments in the urban water sector. = Rural water sector = The majority of the DRC's population without access to safe drinking water lives in rural areas. The rural water sector of the DRC has been neglected for many years and is characterized by a deteriorated infrastructure due to lack of maintenance and spare parts. Furthermore, many water systems are of poor construction quality. The major source of rural water supply are springs, accounting for approximately 90 percent of the total rural water supply. Springs have the advantage that they require only minimal investment to install and maintain. However, springs are often exploited without adequate protection and development. Another important source of water supply in rural areas are shallow wells, using hand and machine pumps. Other rural water supply sources include boreholes, small piped distribution systems and rainwater harvesting systems. Generally, charges for rural water systems do not cover operational costs. Furthermore, almost no water quality testing is conducted. Current investments in the rural water sector aim at the expansion of borehole drilling and small piped networks in large villages, which each serve between 2,000 and 5,000 people and are managed by autonomous community-based associations and local private firms. Furthermore, the Villages Assainis and √âcoles Assainies programs target the systematic development of the rural water sector in small dispersed villages of typically 500 to 1,000 people. The key concept of the program is the improvement of drinking water quality by tapping springs and installing shallow wells with the help of the local communities. Small villages with a population of less than 100 people, which account for 37 percent of the rural population, are not captured by the program and, hence, represent a gap in the development plans for the water sector. = Social impacts = The water crisis in the DRC is impacting especially the most vulnerable groups of society, namely women and children living in poor, unplanned peri-urban areas and remote rural areas. In crowded urban centres, households often have to purchase their water at inflated prices due to high demand and supply scarcity, while unimproved water sources are used for drinking water supply in rural areas, posing significant health risks. Typically, women and children assume the main responsibility of providing water supplies for their families. Water supply scarcity transforms this process into a highly laborious and time-consuming activity, which decreases the amount of time available for education. = Degradation of water resources = Flooding in Kinshasa In many areas of the DRC, land use changes are associated with degradation of drinking water sources. The main threat to drinking water sources poses the unregulated growth of urban and rural areas. The nonexistence of drinking water protection zones results in the exposure of vulnerable source areas to pollution and land degradation. Springs, river intake zones, wellheads, priority lake and reservoir segments as well as aquifer recharge areas comprise the most endangered water source areas, which typically lack any form of identifiable demarcation and protection. Modification of runoff patterns, increased erosion and environmental degradation are the consequences of unregulated expansion of inhabited and agricultural areas. Development of housing, poor road construction, pit latrines, septic tanks, mining operations, and tailings are important contributors to pollution of water sources. In urban areas, industry, fuel stations, garages, abattoirs and storm water runoff are further sources of contamination. Biological contamination from sewage and solid waste disposal and increased suspended sediment loads are the two main sources of pollution. The underlying cause of the degradation of water resources is the lack of organized land use planning and management. Furthermore, nationwide water quality monitoring is lacking.  Solving the water crisis: UN recommendations  In order to reach the water targets stated in the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and the UN Millennium Development Goals, UNEP published several recommendations for tackling the water issues in the DRC in its technical report in 2011. These recommendations are centred around three key aspects: Support of the water sector governance reform, technical and institutional capacity-building and establishing a scientific information base. Recommendations highlighted as \\"key interventions\\" include: a) the development of a national water policy, sectoral water strategies and statutory regulations; b) the establishment of a comprehensive national water information system; c) implementation of autonomous, community-based management of microscale water infrastructure; d) establishment of a capacity- building program for decentralized water institutions; e) development and implementation of watershed-based source protection plans. The UN recommendations on water issues in the DRC had a target date of 2015, in line with the UN Millennium Development Goals. The global UN Millennium Development Goals Report 2015 is already available. However, a detailed evaluation of the current situation of the water sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo has not been published yet. In January 2016, the World Bank commissioned a study to characterize levels of poverty in the DRC, including the evaluation of the quality of access to water and sanitation services.

Their main coat colors are chestnut, bay, and roan. While their phenotype is similar to the classic Colonial Spanish Horse, the actual origin of Cerbat mustangs is unclear, but they have been identified by DNA testing as of Colonial Spanish horse ancestry, and they are recognized by the Spanish Mustang registry as valid foundation stock for that standardized breed. Cerbats possess the ability to gait. Characteristics The Cerbat mustang is said to be similar to the classic Andalusian horse in conformation, and has characteristics consistent with Spanish horse type. They are tall, and average 750 to 800 pounds in weight. The first generation in captivity, however, was said to stand only . Cerbats are most commonly bay and roan, but there are some grays, blacks, sorrels, and duns found on the Cerbat Herd Management Area (HMA) in Arizona. Those in private hands are said to only be bay, roan, or chestnut. White markings on legs and heads are common. Roan Cerbat foals are born roan, unlike some roan foals of other stock that are born a dark color and \\"roan out\\" as they get older, fading in color. They are considered calm, quiet, and intelligent. Some Cerbats can perform intermediate ambling gaits. The feral horse bands today are found in Arizona. For this reason, they are accepted by the Spanish Mustang registry. There is no formal Cerbat horse registry at present and the variety is very rare in captivity, with a high number of 45 horses registered, and a stable number of about 70 feral individual still found in the Cerbat HMA. History The Colonial Spanish horse is believed to be an ancestor of the Cerbat mustang and the Andalusian horse, shown above. It is hypothesized that the Cerbat mustang is descended from Colonial Spanish horses brought to what is now the Southwestern United States (then New Spain) in the 16th century. Other hypotheses are that they arrived in the area in the 18th century or were abandoned by ranchers in the early 19th. They have been blood-tested and determined to be of Colonial Spanish horse ancestry. The Cerbats are described as of \\"classic Andalusian\\" type. The Cerbat herds were documented as well-established by 1860. In 1971, numbers dropped dramatically during a drought when livestock ranchers shot many free-roaming horses, believing that they were competing with cattle for scarce water resources. At that time, about 18 Cerbats were captured and preserved in private herds. After the passage of time, about 20 horses were found to remain in the area. In 1990, another remnant feral population was discovered by the Bureau of Land Management and blood testing determined that they were related to the animals that had been preserved in private herds. Cerbat stallions in captivity have been bred to mares of other Spanish- ancestry mustangs to keep the bloodline alive without inbreeding. Their name comes from the Cerbat Mountains where the Cerbat herd is located. Uses Cerbat Mustangs are used in many ways, including endurance riding, eventing, trail classes, ranch and cattle work, team penning, roping, and other western competition.

One year earlier the city had 2,372 residents.City of Osnabr√ºck, Referat f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und B√ºrgerbeteiligung ‚Äì Statistics Department, 02/2009 (PDF file, 38 KB, in German)City of Osnabr√ºck, Referat f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und B√ºrgerbeteiligung ‚Äì Statistics Department, 02/2009 (PDF file) It covers an area of 407.2 hectares.City of Osnabr√ºck, Referat f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und B√ºrgerbeteiligung ‚Äì Statistics Department, 12/2004 (PDF file) The most important aspect of the area‚Äôs economy is the city harbour from which the district takes its name; primarily home to industrial estates. The harbour is connected to the Mittelland Canal by the Osnabr√ºck branch canal (termed the ‚ÄúStichkanal‚Äù or ‚ÄúZweigkanal‚Äù). The construction of the harbour basin, along with the closing off of the area, began in 1912; in 1916 the first ship was berthed here, one year after the completion of the branch canal ‚Äì the barge ‚ÄúMinden 52‚Äù, which had transported 475 tons of oats to Osnabr√ºck, arrived on 3 April.Osnabr√ºck Branch Canal on the webpage of the Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration 1.28 million tons of goods were handled in the harbour area during 2004; goods transported by ship accounted for 629,000 tons of this total.Langkopf, L., ‚ÄúOsnabr√ºcker Hafen: Spitzenumschlag und Ausbaupl√§ne‚Äù in Wirtschaft Osnabr√ºck-Emsland (4/2005), p.35 In 2008 1.24 million tons were handled; there was, however, a marked decrease in 2009.Heisner, G., ‚ÄúIn den Binnenhafen herrscht Flaute am Kai‚Äù, DVZ Online (accessed 22 August 2009) The local Hafenbahn (harbour railway) is run by the Stadtwerke Osnabr√ºck (Osnabr√ºck Public Utilities), which also runs the harbour itself. Businesses based at the harbour include Hellmann Worldwide Logistics, founded in 1871 as a forwarding company and today active internationally. The company uses the former Speicher III (Warehouse No. III) as an office building; having been built in 1934 as a granary, it was redesigned substantially from 2008 onwards and has since won awards in its new function. Another business based around this area is the paper manufacturer Ahlstrom.Wirtschaftsf√∂rderung Osnabr√ºck GmbH Since 2007, passenger ships have once again been running along the branch canal.Osnabr√ºck harbour and branch canal The Hafen district is home to a former barracks building used by the British armed forces based in Germany ‚Äì the Roberts Barracks.

The Osnabr√ºck-Piesberg railway station is located in the northern part of the Hafen district; it runs special services using museum trains, which travel via Osnabr√ºck-Altstadt towards the Hauptbahnhof (central station) on several days every year.  History  After the decision was made not to extend the Mittelland Canal ‚Äì as originally planned ‚Äì through the cities of Hildesheim, Salzgitter and Osnabr√ºck (due to reasons of cost and longitudinal profile), it was decided in 1905 that branch canals should be set up so that the emergent industry in these cities could profit from the favourable transport conditions offered by the Mittelland Canal. Osnabr√ºck‚Äôs branch canal starts in the Hafen area and leads towards Bramsche, where it joins the Mittelland Canal. The initial plan was to have the branch canal lead to the smelting works in Georgsmarienh√ºtte; this however was dropped due to the costs entailed.

Megh formed on November 5, 2015, in the eastern Arabian Sea, and followed a path similar to Chapala. After moving northward, the cyclone turned to the west, and fueled by warm water temperatures, it quickly intensified. On November 7, the storm developed an eye in the center and began to rapidly intensify into a mature cyclone. By the next day, the India Meteorological Department estimated peak 3 minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), and the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated 1 minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone brushed the northern coast of Socotra. The storm steadily weakened thereafter, especially after it skirted the northern Somalia coast. After entering the Gulf of Aden, Megh turned to the west-northwest and struck southwestern Yemen on 10 November as a deep depression, dissipating shortly thereafter. When Megh passed near Socotra, residents were just beginning to return after the previous cyclone, and many had to evacuate again. Additional heavy rainfall and high winds lashed the island, which destroyed 500 homes and damaged another 3,000. The consecutive storms damaged 785 fishing boats, left 80% of the roads impassible, and caused an island-wide power outage. Megh killed 18 people on Socotra and injured another 60. The heavy damage on the island prompted nearby countries and international organizations to deliver relief goods and medical teams. Later, Megh brought torrential rainfall and high waves to northern Somalia, killing livestock and damaging schools. The storm's final landfall in Yemen marked little rainfall or effects. Meteorological history On November 3, an area of scattered convection persisted about 860 km (535 mi) southwest of Mumbai, India, in the central Arabian Sea. The thunderstorms were associated with a weak and broad circulation, located in an area of low wind shear and warm water temperatures over , both favorable conditions. At the time, the system was located east of Cyclone Chapala, which had recently struck Yemen. On November 4, a distinct low pressure area developed in association with a mid- to upper-level low, while the region was in an active Madden Julian Oscillation phase favorable for storm development. The circulation became better defined as outflow increased, amplified by an anticyclone over the system. Based on the organization, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the low as a depression at 00:00 UTC on November 5\\\\. About six hours later, the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression, and at 12:00 UTC that day the agency upgraded it to a cyclonic storm, naming it Megh. Earlier that day, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 05A while the storm was about 1,120 km (700 mi) east of Socotra island offshore Yemen. Upon forming, Megh was moving to the west- southwest due to a ridge to the north. While Megh was in its formative stages, it developed broken rainbands that swirled into the circulation center, which was located beneath the blossoming convection. On November 6, dry air began to become entrained into the circulation, although the unfavorable conditions did not disrupt the center. Instead, the convection became better organized, developing into a central dense overcast, as well as the beginnings of an eye feature. As the storm continued to develop, the radius of maximum winds shrank, resulting in a smaller storm than the previous Cyclone Chapala. At 12:00 UTC on November 7, the JTWC upgraded Megh to the equivalent of a hurricane after a small defined eye became evident. The storm began rapid deepening that day due to the continued low shear and warm water temperatures, and the convection became more symmetric and circular. Such intensification was not anticipated by tropical cyclone forecast models, which emphasized that the external conditions, such as dry air from the west, would be unfavorable. At 06:00 UTC on November 7, the IMD upgraded Megh to a severe cyclonic storm, and just nine hours later upgraded it to a very severe cyclonic storm - the equivalent to hurricane intensity with 3 minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). A weakening Cyclone Megh approaching Yemen on November 9 Cyclone Megh continued to rapidly intensify while approaching the island of Socotra. It developed a small eye just 7.4 km (4.6 mi) in diameter by early on November 8, along with a convective core just 280 km (175 mi) in diameter. At 03:00 UTC that day, the IMD upgraded the system to an extremely severe cyclonic storm, and three hours later estimated peak 3 minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 205 km/h (125 mph). Since accurate record keeping began in the basin in 1990, this marked the first time in the Arabian Sea that there were two cyclones in one season with 1 minute winds of at least 185 km/h (115 km/h). Between 06:00-12:00 UTC on November 8, the eye of Megh passed just north of Socotra, with the resulting land interaction causing the eyewall to disappear and for the winds to diminish. After exiting the island, the cyclone began weakening further due to cooler water temperatures and drier air from the Arabian Peninsula to the northwest. Early on November 9, the center of Megh passed 57 km (36 mi) north of Cape Guardafui, and further land interaction with Somalia to the south increasingly degraded the storm's structure. At 00:00 UTC that day, Megh weakened into a very severe cyclonic storm. After passing just north of Somalia, Megh progressed westward into the Gulf of Aden, the waterway between Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula. This marked the first time on record when two storms entered the body of water in the same year. By 12:00 UTC on November 9, the center was beginning to become exposed from the convection due to the unfavorable conditions. Throughout the day, the structure rapidly deteriorated as the storm curved to the west-northwest. At 21:00 UTC on November 9, Megh weakened further into a severe cyclonic storm, and degraded further to a cyclonic storm by six hours later. While just offshore Yemen, the circulation slowed and turned to the northeast, after the ridge to the north receded eastward. At 06:00 UTC on November 10 the storm weakened to a deep depression, and three hours later Megh made landfall in southwestern Yemen northeast of Zinjibar, with estimated winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). The structure eroded significantly over land, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories. The circulation continued inland, and Megh degenerated into a low pressure area by 18:00 UTC on November 10. Preparations and impact Megh making landfall over Yemen on November 10 Occurring just days after Cyclone Chapala bypassed the island, Cyclone Megh struck Socotra, bringing further winds, rainfall, and flash flooding. Residents who returned home after Chapala had to evacuate again due to Megh, and 800 people on the nearby island of Abd al Kuri evacuated to Hadhramaut Governorate on the Yemeni mainland. Some relief goods delivered after Chapala were damaged during Megh. The cyclone wrecked about 500 homes and damaged 3,000 others, which displaced about 18,000 people to schools and mosques. The storm disrupted entire villages - tainting water wells and affecting communication towers - while also damaging the main hospital and power station. This resulted in fuel shortages and an island wide power outage. The combination of high winds and rainfall caused the island's main port to close, with 785 fishing boats and 1,130 fishing nets damaged by Chapala and Megh. About 80% of the roads on Socotra were left impassible. The storm also killed many livestock and downed thousands of palm trees. Two people died on Socotra when their homes collapsed. Overall, the storm killed 18 people on the island and injured 60 others. After the storm, communication disruptions on Socotra made it difficult for relief workers to determine the needs of the affected residents. Due to the main port being damaged, residents built a makeshift pathway to assist relief distribution from a ship carrying 700 tons of supplies from the United Arab Emirates. Relief distribution was also disrupted by the heavy damage to Socotra's infrastructure, including damaged roads and minimal power or fuel supply. After the storm, displaced residents stayed in public buildings or outside damaged houses. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, various Persian Gulf countries sent 43 planes with supplies to the island by 19 November. The United Arab Emirates sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500 tons of food, 10 tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200 barrels of food. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000 shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra. While brushing the northern tip of Somalia, Megh dropped heavy rainfall to coastal regions of the nation, particularly in the Puntland region. There, stations recorded more than 300% of the average annual rainfall. Eyl reported of rainfall over 24 hours. Megh also lashed the coast with strong waves, and the combination with rainfall damaged several boats. The rains led to flash flooding that blocked roads. Megh damaged schools, police stations, and the main hospital in Alula District. The passage of Megh also resulted in the loss of livestock in the region, and many fruit and palm trees were knocked down. After the passages of earlier Cyclone Chapala and Megh, the local Red Cross chapter distributed blankets, sleeping mats, and mattresses to the affected families. By the time Megh made landfall on the Yemen mainland, it had weakened enough to not produce any strong winds or heavy rainfall.

Life and work  Hanna Berger grew up in the working class district of Meidling. From age 14 she received piano lessons. From 1927 to 1928 she became a member of the Communist Party. From 1929 to 1934 she studied modern dance in Berlin along with Jonny Ahemm, Vera Skoronel, Gertrud Wienecke and Mary Wigman in Dresden; she has also been described as part of the free dance movement. During this time, her relationship with sculptor Fritz Cremer began, which lasted until the 1950s.  Artistic career  Berger was recorded as a member of the touring company of Mary Wigman in 1935, and that of Trudi Schoop in 1936 for her US tour. She added her knowledge of modern dance to the \\"German champion centres for dance\\" in Berlin. In October 1937 she made her evening debut as a choreographer and dancer as part of an eleven-part solo at the Berlin Bach-Saal. At the critical time of her solo \\"Warrior\\" (with music by Kessler) she was forced to flee from Nazi Germany. She was a known critic of the fascist dictatorship. Until then she had only practiced in the Swiss magazine under the pseudonym \\"The Stage Artist\\" (1936). Her Vienna debut took place in December 1937 at the great hall of the Urania. Berger was an active member of the communist resistance and a part of the Red Orchestra/Schulze- Boysen-Gruppe group, with extensive activities in Italy. In 1942 she was arrested in Poznan due to \\"suspicion to commit high treason\\". She was blamed for \\"enabling subversive communist gatherings in her home\\". Presumed innocent after the intercession of many prominent personalities, including the dancer Marianne Vogelsang, Berger was acquitted after several months of detention on 22 August 1943 by the People's Court in Berlin. She was sentenced to two years forced labour; in 1943 she was able to escape due to the bombing in Berlin. Despite her injuries she was able to travel to Vienna. After the war she worked as a dance critic and a dancing and film screenplay author. She performed at the Vienna Theatre and in Paris. She also taught modern dance at the University of Music and Performing Arts. Until 1950 she headed the private \\"Vienna Children's Theatre\\", of which the following names have become known, such as Christine Ostermayer, Klaus L√∂witsch and Gerhard Senft. The dancing solos \\"solidarity\\" (Eisler/Brecht) and \\"Battle Cry\\" were some of Berger's strengths. With the founding of the GDR led to Berger's decision to emigrate there. In 1956 she took over the movement director of Jan√°ƒçek's opera \\"The Cunning Little Vixen\\", directed by Walter Felsenstein. Her efforts to be firmly ordered as a director under Felsenstein ended in failure. Until her ultimate death she commuted between Vienna, Paris, Italy, the GDR and other socialist countries with no permanent home or residence. Her communist convictions remained an obstacle to her greater career. In the GDR performers could not express their artistic personality, because it was a little too dogmatic. After Fritz Cremer, the Viennese Paul Kont was her life partner. With him she founded the Vienna Chamber Dance Group in or around 1954. He also wrote the music to three dance pieces, among other things, including \\"Dance ads\\" by Schoop in 1956 and \\"The sad hunter\\" and \\"Amores Pastorals\\" in 1958, which was choreographed and put on Austrian television. By studying film design at the Vienna Music Academy from 1955 to 1957 she hoped until recently on a new career as a filmmaker. On behalf of the City of Vienna she was able to study with Marcel Marceau in Paris. As one of the first of his students she earned a teaching diploma. She also performed work by Grete Wiesenthal. Hanna Berger died on 15 January 1962 at the East Berlin Charit√© Hospital. She is buried in a grave of honour in the City of Vienna.  Reception  In the Vienna Urania on 5 January 1958 Berger officially announced her dancers to a new generation. The dancer and ballet teacher Mitterhuber received the solo \\"Unknown from the Seine\\" (Debussy). She had studied at the dance department of the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna from 1947‚Äì1957, and was also featured in the Berger Dance program in 1958. With the new production of this solo, which has since been danced by dancer Esther Koller, Vienna has begun rediscovering the visionary Berger (among other things she has proposed the creation of a dance stage and dance film museum). As part of the production \\"Dances of outlaws\\" of Esther Linley, in 1995 this solo was a central role at the Linzer Posthof. In 2000 Mitterhuber reconstructed the Berger solo \\"mimosa\\" (Casella) again danced by Esther Koller. The exhibition program \\"Dance in exile\\" was curated by Andrea Amort at the Vienna Academy Theatre during the festival tanz2000.at & ImPulsTanz. The program \\"Hanna Berger: Retouchings‚Äù was curated in 2006 by Andrea Amort at the Festspielhaus St P√∂lten. Fragmentary works by Berger were choreographed as new creations by Nicholas Adler, Manfred Aichinger, Bernd Roger Bienert, Rose Breuss and Willi Dorner. The program was shown at festivals in Washington, Braunschweig and Vienna. Esther Koller danced \\"L'Inconnue de la Seine\\"in the 2011 opening of an exhibition for the achievements of women teaching at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna.

Background  Immediately after the assassination the ƒêinƒëiƒá, a state of emergency was declared by interim president, Nata≈°a Miƒáiƒá, giving the government and police extraordinary powers in the pursuit of the assassins. The state of emergency lasted from the day of the assassination, 12 March 2003, until 22 April 2003.  Action  The primary goal of the action in Operation Sabre was to find the assassins of ƒêinƒëiƒá, but the investigation expanded to other persons who were suspected to have connections to organized crime groups. In the course of Operation Sabre, the police claimed to solve several other high-profile crimes which had been unresolved for years, including the assassination of former Serbian President, Ivan Stamboliƒá. The members of several organised crime groups were eliminated in the course of Operation Sabre, including the Zemun clan, some of whom were former members of an elite police unit, the Special Operations Unit. Milan Sarajliƒá, the Deputy State Prosecutor of Serbia, was arrested and confessed to being on the payroll of the Zemun clan.  Criticism  11,665 people were detained in connection with suspected links to organized crime. Among them were many public figures and entertainers. According to Gow, \\"The state of emergency period in general, and Operation 'Sabre' in particular, remain controversial in some political circles, and concerns were raised that the Government and the police used the situation to deal with political opponents.\\" Some political opponents accused the government of human rights abuse during the operation but the government and proponents of the action pointed out that the Serbia and Montenegro became a member of the Council of Europe during the action and that the majority of the organizations sent to analyze the situation during the operation including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe declared that the operation was performed without breaches of human rights. Some organisations disagree, notably Human Rights Watch, which was critical of detention in isolation and interrogation without a lawyer being present, and Amnesty International, which alleged ill-treatment and torture.

This followed the brief Greco-Turkish war of 1878 in which Greece had declared war on 2 February against the Ottoman Empire, only for the Greek forces to return to their bases shortly after crossing the border due to the intervention of the Great Powers and the signature of the Treaty of San Stefano. It is reported that revolutionary outbreaks in the same year, are located alongside Macedonia in Epirus, Thessaly and Crete, seeking union with the Greek state. In Macedonia there was greater willingness and enthusiasm than in Thessaly. The revolution had two main foci in Macedonia, one was on Olympus, and the other in Vourinos.  Events  The revolution of Olympus began in Litohoro on February 19, 1878 led by Kosmas Doumpiotis extended to the surrounding areas and drowned in blood by the Ottomans, with its tragic epilogue being the destruction of Litohoro on March 4 of that year. In the revolution of Litohoro, which was the forerunner to the uprisings across Macedonia, participated bodies from all the regions of Western and Central Macedonia, as well as Eastern Macedonia (mainly from Melnik). The uprising began on Mount Vourinos led by Anastasios Picheon. On February 18, 1878, rebels from different parts of western Macedonia, formed in the Vourinos settlement, the \\"Provisional Government of Macedonian province of Elimeia\\" seeking the abolition of the Treaty of San Stefano and the Association of Macedonia with Greece. The summer of 1878, about 15,000 armed men escalated a guerrilla war in the mountains of Western Macedonia from Kozani to Bitola. The revolutionaries of Western Macedonia had no help from the Greek state. In northern Macedonia, rebellions went as far as Veles, where the chieftain Katrakos was acting with 50 men. After the suppression of the uprising, many Velesians were forced to resort to Thessaloniki. The revolt ended in the winter of that year due to bad weather and lack of organization.  Aftermath  The Macedonian Revolution of 1878 did not achieve its purpose, but the opposition of the Greek population of Macedonia to the annexation to a Greater Bulgaria was documented internationally, and also the diplomatic position of Greece and those countries opposed to the Treaty of San Stefano was strengthened. So at the Treaty of Berlin in June 1878, the Macedonian territories remained Ottoman and were not annexed to Bulgaria. In response to this development, the Bulgarian population of Macedonia rose similarly in the autumn of 1878 in regions of Kresna and Razlog, but to no avail.  Notes  Today, the Vourinos settlement is abandoned, while its inhabitants moved 4 kilometers to the south, creating the Chromio settlement.

The station was a later addition to the Maryport and Carlisle Railway's (MCR) single track Derwent Branch which opened in 1867 to connect their main line near with the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway near . In March 1887 the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway (C&WJR;) opened its \\"Northern Extension\\" from through and , meeting the Derwent Branch at a new junction at Linefoot. Linefoot opened as a goods only station in 1887, its first stationmaster being Daniel Dickinson. The C&WJR; built this line to connect the C&WJR; with Carlisle and the Solway viaduct. The line was double track from Workington to Seaton, then single through Great Broughton to Linefoot. Exchange sidings were laid at Linefoot and in 1898 a connection was laid between the Northern extension and Alice Pit a short distance south of Linefoot station. Most stations on C&WJR; lines had heavy industrial neighbours, such as ironworks next to Cleator Moor West, or served primarily industrial workforces, such as Keekle Colliers' Platform. Linefoot, however, was and remains open farming country with no village as such. History The C&WJR; was built in the late 1870s, being one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. It was originally intended to drive the line northwards across country to meet the Caledonian Railway and cross into Scotland by the Solway Viaduct, but an accommodation was made with the LNWR leading to the intended northern extension being greatly watered down to three lines: * a link from to which opened in 1880 * a link from Cloffocks Junction to the CKPR line which opened in March 1885, and * the \\"Northern Extension\\" through Great Broughton to Linefoot. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the Northern Extension, which passed through open country. Passenger services were provided calling at Great Broughton, but they were so unsuccessful they petered out after a mere two months. The C&WJR; earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. All C&WJR;'s lines were heavily graded. Almost all of the first three miles of the Northern Extension from Calva Junction through Seaton was rising at 1 in 70, with gentler slopes thereafter to the extension's summit at Great Broughton This favoured loaded coal and coke trains heading for Workington. The Northern Extension became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the Grouping of 1923. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the C&WJR; was particularly at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when the C&WJR; handled 1,644,514 tons of freight. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of ¬£83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling ¬£6,570. The high water mark for tonnage on the C&WJR; was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected at Harrington Junction in 1919. Services No evidence has been published of any Maryport & Carlisle Railway passenger service calling at Linefoot station. C&WJR; passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines referred to as \\"rolling ruins\\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949. No Sunday passenger service was ever provided on any C&WJR; line. The Northern Extension had three stations: Seaton, and Linefoot, the last being run jointly with the Maryport and Carlisle Railway (MCR). A passenger service was provided to Seaton over two periods: 1888 to 1897 and 1907 to 1922. The service in the first period appears to have been out and back over the to . This was reduced to Wednesdays and Saturdays only (Workington Market Days) from March 1891 and to Saturdays only from January 1894, being withdrawn completely in July 1897. The company tried again ten years later, with what appears to have been another daily out and back from Workington Central. From 1 September 1908 this was extended, on Saturdays only, to Great Broughton and Linefoot, making those stations qualify as stations having had a publicly advertised passenger service. That experiment failed, as they disappeared from the timetable in December of that year, leaving Seaton as the only Northern extension station with a public passenger service. Both Great Broughton and Linefoot stations remained open for goods traffic. The W&CJR; ran many workmen's trains. Three collieries were served by the Northern Extension - Camerton, Buckhill and Alice Pit. No source lists any station, halt or workmen's service to this last. The 1920 Working Time Table lists Alice Pit, but shows no booked services of any description. and both had workmen's services at some point, but they are not mentioned in the May 1920 Working Time Table. Indeed, Camerton Colliery is not mentioned at all. The 1920 Working Time Table shows no Goods (as opposed to mineral) trains or \\"Through goods\\" trains booked to call at or pass Linefoot in either direction. Rundown and closure The West Cumberland iron and steel industry was heavily dependent on supplies of coke from the Northumberland and Durham coalfields. The Northern Extension allowed \\"a large proportion\\" of this traffic to be routed away from Maryport and the coastal line. Likewise the short chord between Workington Bridge and Cloffocks Junction allowed Durham coke traffic to reach the furnaces via then the C&WJR.; These must have suffered a significant decline, as by 1920 there were just two booked mineral workings each way each weekday between Linefoot and Workington. It is therefore no surprise that the line from Buckhill Colliery to Linefoot closed on 1 September 1921, closing Great Broughton and Linefoot stations and their residual goods traffic with it. Although Linefoot Station closed then, Bullgill to Brigham services continued to pass through the station site until 29 April 1935. Afterlife The track was lifted before the Second World War. By 2013 the trackbed through the station site could intermittently be traced on satellite images.

The Romanos Ivory is a carved ivory relief panel from the Byzantine empire measuring 24.6 cm (at the highest) by 15.5 cm and 1.2 cm thick.Parani, Maria G. \\"The Romanos Ivory and the New Tokali Kilise: Imperial Costume as a Tool for Dating Byzantine Art\\"(2001). Cahiers arch√©ologiques. Fin de l'antiquit√© et moyen-√¢ge vol. 49 (2001) p. 15-28 The panel is currently in the Cabinet des M√©dailles of Paris. Inscriptions name the figures of the emperor Romanos and his wife Eudokia, who are being blessed by Christ. However, there were two imperial couples by these names and scholars have yet to agree which is shown. It was first believed to represent Romanos IV and therefore dated between 1068 and 1071. Discoveries of other carved relief works in the 20th century led researchers to think that it represents the earlier Romanos II, changing the date of creation to somewhere between 945 and 949.Kalavrezou-Maxeiner, Ioli. \\"Eudokia Makrembolitissa and the Romanos Ivory.\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 31: 305-25. Romanos IV and Eudokia Makrembolitissa Until 1926, this panel was assumed to be depicting the coronation and/or marriage of Romanos IV Diogenes and Eudokia Makrembolitissa, mainly due to the inscription over Eudokia‚Äôs head which reads ‚ÄúBasilis Rhomaion‚Äù. Basilis (and Basilissa) was a title only used by women who were regents for their minor sons, which Eudokia Makrembolitissa was at the time of her marriage to Romanos IV. The term was only used by two other women, both of whom assumed the throne as sole rulers or regents for their sons during their lifetime. The image of this double coronation was also used on seals and the coinage of the realm to both promote Eudokia‚Äôs power and legitimize Romanos IV as emperor. Iconography Contemporary scholarship on this piece asserts that this work represents the 945 CE Easter coronation of junior emperor Romanos II and his child bride, Bertha (renamed Eudokia on her arrival at court). Stating that ‚Äúemperors are always shown more or less as they looked‚Äù, scholars point to the fact that the Romanos depicted on the Ivory is beardless, and therefore more likely to be Romanos II, who was only six years old by the time of his coronation in 945 CE. In contrast, the later Romanos IV would have been about 30 and had a full beard. There is also some allusion to the Eudokia figure‚Äôs ‚Äòchild-like features‚Äô.Cutler, Anthony. ‚ÄúThe Date and Significance of the Romanos Ivory,‚Äù in Byzantine East, Latin West: Art Historical Studies in Honor of Kurt Weitzmann, ed. Doula Mouriki et al. (Princeton: Department of Art and Archaeology, Princeton University, 1995), 605‚Äì10. Costuming of the couple also favors the Romanos II theory, as Romanos is shown wearing a loros while Eudokia wears a chlamys, signifying she is subordinate in rank to the senior empress, Helena.Pariani, 21 It is therefore assumed that this is the only surviving imperial portrait where Christ is crowning a junior emperor and empress. Style Some scholarship links the style of the Romanos Ivory to other surviving works of Byzantine art that are more certainly dated in the 10th century. An ivory plaque ordered as part of an epistolary by Sigebert, bishop of Minden (1022-1036) is part of such a group, and Cutler states ‚Äúif‚Ä¶ the central portion of the triptych that had arrived in the west before the death of Sigebert of Minden in 1036, it follows that the Romanos Ivory could not have been made in the second half of the 11th century.‚ÄùCutler, Anthony. \\"A Byzantine Triptych in Medieval Germany and Its Modern Recovery.\\" Gesta 37.1 (1998): 3-12. This claim also fits with other assertions that metal and steatite were favored over ivory as a medium by the 11th century.Cormack, Robin. Byzantine Art. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2000. There are currently no other recorded works where a wife of a crown prince was portrayed, nor a junior emperor without the senior.Kalavrezou-Maxeiner, 310 However, others note that the ivory more stylistically resembles other works dated in the second half of the 11th century such as the Harbaville Triptych and at least two other Byzantine era triptychs, while noting that 10th-century carving was more flat and use less undercutting than is seen on the Romanos Ivory. Facial types and other stylistic details have also been related to works of the late 11th century.Kalavrezou-Maxeiner, 322-23 References Category:Byzantine ivory Category:10th-century sculptures Category:Collection of the Cabinet des M√©dailles, Paris ","title":"Romanos Ivory"},{"id":"49212827","text":"Granville Richard Swift (December 25, 1870 ‚Äì May 4, 1949) was a Virginia politician.

The house was first built in 1888 and it was listed in the Danish national registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 14 October 1996. The house is situated on the northern border of Riis Skov in the northern neighbourhood Risskov. The building is today privately owned and used as a home. The Norwegian House was originally built for the Nordic Exhibition of 1888 in Copenhagen by the architect Martin Nyrop. The house was part of a themed exhibit featuring a number of wooden houses of which several have survived until today. The Norwegian house was bought by Cecilia Meisner who had it rebuilt in new neighbourhood in Risskov in 1890. Another house, the Swedish House (Danish: Det Svenske Hus), was bought by Queen Louise who placed it in Bernstoffparken (Bernstoff Park) in Gentofte. The Swedish House was listed in 1987 and the Norwegian House was listed in 1996. At least two more of Nyrop's wooden buildings survive and are situated at Frederiksberg Hospital.  Architecture  Nyrop elected to make all of his exhibition pavilions of wood at a time when iron and glass was favored for temporary structures. He justified the decision by claiming the result would be prettier for the same cost. His background as a carpenter may have been an influence and it gave him the opportunity to showcase his ideals of quality materials and visible construction principles. The Norwegian House is inspired by Nordic log architecture, wood ornamentation and polychromy which mirror the National romantic currents in architecture at the time. The house is constructed of wooden logs painted Swedish red contrasted by white windows and balcony. The roof is ridged and plated in slate. The house combines symmetrical and asymmetrical elements. The western side is symmetrical with three windows, both gables are asymmetrical with bay windows on the ground floor and balconies on the 1st floor and the symmetrical garden facade to the east has a dominating loggia porch with a large covered balcony on top.

An advocate of cultural Zionism and the reviver of Hebrew language, Simon was a scholar and translator of Ahad Ha'am, and produced the first modern Hebrew translations of Plato. He served as the Chairman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem‚Äôs Executive Council, and from 1949-50 as the university's President. Early life Leon Simon Simon was the son of Rabbi Isadore Simon of the South Manchester Synagogue and Kitty Avner, both of whom had moved to Britain in the late 19th century from Lithuania. He studied at Manchester Grammar School and read Greats at Balliol College at the University of Oxford. In Manchester he became a core part of a group of young anglicised Jewish intellectuals that congregated around Chaim Weizmann. The group included the journalist Harry Sacher, Samuel Landman, Israel Sieff and Simon Marks of Marks & Spencer. All of them had studied at Manchester Grammar School. The group were members of the Manchester Zionist Association, where Simon and his brother Maurice Simon would hold discussions in Hebrew. Charles Dreyfus, Weizmann's employer in Manchester, was the President of the Society. Simon edited the newspaper \\"The Zionist Banner\\" with Sacher and the monthly journal \\"Palestine\\". In 1904 Simon joined the General Post Office and rose to become Director of Telegraphs and Telephones and later Director of Savings. He was made CB in 1931 and was knighted in 1944. He married Ellen Umanski, (later called by the name Lady Ellen Simon), and they had two daughters. Zionist and author Under the influence of Chaim Weizmann, whose family had immigrated from Belarus to Manchester, Simon belonged to the first generation of leading British Jews who preferred Zionism to conventional religiosity and who pressed for Hebrew to supplant Yiddish as the main language of the diaspora. Simon came under the influence of Ahad Ha'am (Asher Zvi Hirsch Ginsberg), a leading figure of cultural Zionism, and went on to translate many of his works into English as well as writing his biography. Simon wrote several works on Zionism, including Zionism and the Jewish Problem published in 1917 and \\"Studies in Jewish Nationalism\\" published in 1920. He also wrote the first translations into modern Hebrew of John Stuart Mill's Essay on Liberty, and of several of Plato's Dialogues, work for which he received Tchernichovsky Prize. Simon accompanied Weizmann as a member of the Zionist Commission alongside Israel Sieff, M. D. Eder and others in 1918 to begin talks with the government of David Lloyd George on the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. A draft of the Balfour Declaration, written by Simon on paper of London's Imperial Hotel on July 17, 1917 was auctioned off in 2005 through Sotheby's for $884,000 US in New York. It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the declaration. The draft of the declaration noted down by Simon read: > \\"H(is) M(ajesty's) G(overnment) accepts the principle that P(alestine) > should be reconstituted as the Nat(ional) Home of the J(ewish) P(eople). HMG > will use its best efforts to secure the achievement of this object, and will > discuss the necessary methods and means with the Z(ionist) O(rganization).\\" From 1946 to 1953 Simon lived in Jerusalem where he served as Chair of the Executive Council of the Hebrew University and from 1949-50 as its President, preceded by Judah Leon Magnes and followed by Selig Brodetsky (1949-1952). He also served as President of Israel Postal Company Bank. A collection of his papers are held at Duke University.

He was shot by three Los Angeles Police Department officers. On December 1, 2016, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced that no criminal charges would be filed against the officers who shot Keunang, and that they considered it an act of self-defense. Later on 10 May, 2018, the Superior Court of California ruled that an officer used an unreasonable amount of force against Keunang and the case was settled with paying his family $1.95 million by the city. Shooting Charley Leundeu Keunang went by the names of \\"Africa\\", \\"Cameroon\\", or \\"Charley Saturmin Robinet\\" (using a stolen ID). He was ordered by police to come out of his tent in Skid Row after fighting with someone inside the tent. Someone called 911 and reported that a robbery had occurred in the area. The officers stated that Keunang became aggressive and ignored commands. After he refused the police order, they dragged him out of the tent. A physical altercation ensued with several police officers, during which three officers shot Keunang, resulting in his death. At least two videos captured the incident. Aftermath Following Keunang's death, a protest was held locally in Los Angeles. The protesters organised using the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. Fourteen people were arrested in the course of the protest. Legal proceedings The shooting was reviewed by the district attorney's office, the Police Commission and its independent inspector general. In February 2016, the Los Angeles Police Commission, the civilian panel that oversees the department, ruled that the shooting did not violate their policy on the use of deadly force, as Keunang had reached for an officer's weapon. The incident resulted in improvements in the training of officers as to how to better handle incidents involving people with mental health issues. On December 1, 2016, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced that they would not file criminal charges against the officers who shot Keunang (Francisco Martinez, Daniel Torres, and Chand Syed). Prosecutors stated that the officers acted in self-defense. On August 5, 2015, Keunang's parents and sister had filed a lawsuit against the city and Police Chief Charlie Beck. On May 10, 2018, the federal jury of seven women and one man found that Francisco Martinez used an unreasonable amount of force against Keunang. They also found that Sgt. Chand Syed breached his duty to intervene. Lawyers for both sides agreed on a settlement in which the city would pay the man's family $1.95 million, according to Joshua Piovia-Scott, an attorney representing the family. It was believed that the videos captured by the officers‚Äô body cameras, which were kept secret for years, were crucial for winning this case. The footage showed officers had the opportunity to deescalate the situation but instead became more aggressive and violent to Keunang. The officers threatened, punched, tased and finally shot Keunang 5 times. It was argued that the officers' actions escalated this situation and caused it to spiral out of control.

It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building. The total cost of the memorial was ¬£3,500, of which McLaren and her father-in-law contributed ¬£1,000 each; her brother-in-law donated a pair of painted stone flags and the remainder was raised from voluntary subscription, which took until 1922. The memorial consists of a brick pavilion at the south end of the garden and a Stone of Remembrance, both at the head of a long reflecting pool, which incorporates the remains of an 18th-century canal. It was unveiled at a ceremony on 9 June 1922. Lutyens went on to use the style of the pavilion for shelter buildings in several war cemeteries on the Western Front, though none of his other war memorials follow the design and the memorial became relatively obscure. Spalding War Memorial is today a Grade I listed building, having been upgraded when Lutyens's war memorials were declared a \\"national collection\\" and all were granted listed building status or had their listing renewed. Background War memorials became a common sight in British towns and cities following the First World War (1914‚Äì1918). Almost one million men from Britain were killed in the conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in Spalding, a town in southern Lincolnshire in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had previously established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both for the commission and through his own practice. Spalding was one of his first war memorial commissions.Skelton, pp. 24‚Äì25.Amery et al., p. 148. The proposal for the Spalding war memorial originated with Barbara McLaren (n√©e Jekyll). Barbara was the widow of Francis McLaren‚ÄîSpalding's Member of Parliament and a Royal Flying Corps officer, who was killed in a flying accident near RAF Montrose in 1917‚Äîand the niece of garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, with whom Lutyens had collaborated on multiple previous projects. Lutyens designed the McLarens' London house on Cowley Street in Westminster in 1911 and shortly after Francis' death in 1917 designed the headstone for his grave in Busbridge in Surrey. He was later responsible for the war memorial in the same village.Skelton, p. 217.Skelton, p. 50. Commissioning Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens to design a memorial for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance standing in front of a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due to the amount of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties. Lutyens's birds-eye view drawings of his original proposal McLaren approached the council with her proposal in January 1918. When it became public after the end of the war, the proposed scheme proved controversial, prompting debate within the community and on the letters pages of the local newspaper. Multiple alternative proposals were submitted, including both purely commemorative schemes such as a clock on the town's corn exchange building and functional schemes such as the conversion of Ayscoughfee Hall into a youth centre. The youth centre and Lutyens's proposal emerged as the leaders, and details of both were published in the local newspaper. The district council called a public meeting to debate the proposals, which was held on 1 August 1919. Around 300 people attended the meeting, at which the proponents of the two leading options plus a third proposal‚Äîthe clock on the corn exchange‚Äîwere allowed fifteen minutes each to outline their scheme. During the meeting, several other proposals were put forward, including a cenotaph or an obelisk in the market place.Skelton, pp. 51‚Äì57. The meeting was closed with the decision to hold a public vote, which was held on 23 August. The ballot paper included seven options, with each voter selecting a single choice: * A modified version of the McLaren‚ÄìLutyens scheme with a clock on the corn exchange building * The McLaren‚ÄìLutyens scheme unmodified * An obelisk in the market place and a memorial clock * The McLaren‚ÄìLutyens scheme and a youth centre in Ayscoughfee Hall * A cenotaph in the market place * A war widows' fund (in lieu of a monument) * The youth centre alone The modified McLaren‚ÄìLutyens proposal emerged the clear winner, receiving 459 votes. The unmodified scheme was the second most popular option with 286 votes; the proposal for an obelisk and clock was the only other option to garner more than 200 votes. In September 1919, the Spalding War and Victory Memorials Committee was formed to oversee fundraising and construction of the memorial, the total cost of which was ¬£3,500. McLaren and her father-in-law Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway contributed ¬£1,000 each, Sir Herbert and Dame Agnes Jekyll donated ¬£100, Henry McLaren (Barbara's brother-in-law) donated the stone flags, and the remainder was raised by public subscription, which took until 1922. The 1922 clock and carillon, now housed in a glass tower attached to the South Holland Centre The clock and carillon (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, the same year as Lutyens's memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of those involved in the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and carillon after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower. History Lutyens's memorial in Ayscoughfee Hall Gardens was constructed by Hodson Limited of Nottingham, at the south end of the formal gardens, replacing an earlier castellated tower‚Äîa 19th-century folly known as the \\"Owl Tower\\". The unveiling took place at a ceremony on 9 June 1922, presided over by General Sir Ian Hamilton and dedicated by Reverend Alfred Jarvis, Assistant Chaplain-General to Northern Command. Barbara McLaren attended the ceremony along with several other members of the Jekyll and McLaren families.Skelton, p. 57. Several dignitaries gave speeches at the ceremony, including Jarvis, who spoke of the dead among the poppies on the Western Front, a \\"symbol of oblivion\\". Hamilton spoke of the results of the carnage of the war; referring to the idea that the First World War was the war to end war, he told the assembled: \\"The result has been so different. Europe is a seething cauldron of racial hatred; Ireland [...] is linked in our minds with the idea of murder; Mesopotamia [modern-day Iraq], India, and Egypt are straining at the leash of civilisation.\\" The general concluded: \\"If you want to end war, you must end hatred\\" and that \\"In that way, I believe we shall be working towards peace, and in that way we will be doing in our own small way our best each of us‚Äîand Spalding minds united are a great force‚Äîand in that way we shall perpetuate the memories of those whose untimely deaths we have come here to commemorate\\".The Lincolnshire, Boston and Spalding Free Press, 13 June 1922; quoted in Skelton, p. 57. At the conclusion of the speeches a lone bugler played the \\"Last Post\\" and the crowd sang the national anthem, after which the dignitaries‚Äîincluding McLaren and her sons‚Äîlaid floral tributes around the Stone of Remembrance. The names of a further 24 casualties from the First World War were added to the central panel of the memorial prior to Remembrance Sunday 2014. The additions were the result of research by a member of the local branch of the Royal British Legion (RBL), which produced a list of 50 names, though the remaining casualties' connections to Spalding were deemed too tenuous for their names to be included. As a result of local government reorganisations, the memorial is now the responsibility of South Holland District Council, which is based in Spalding. Design The pavilion and Stone of Remembrance The pavilion and Stone of Remembrance Spalding's war memorial comprises a brick-built pavilion structure with hipped roof of red pantiles and floored with red bricks in a herringbone pattern. The side of the pavilion facing the pool has three Tuscan stone arches, with another Tuscan arch opening on each sidewall. The solid rear wall bears two painted stone flags‚Äîthe Union Flag to the left and the White Ensign to the right‚Äîand three panels on which are inscribed the names of over 200 servicemen from Spalding who died in the First World War. The central panel bears the dedication: \\"IN LOVE AND HONOUR OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE YEARS OF WAR MCMXIV ‚Äì MCMXIX / THIS MEMORIAL IS RAISED IN THEIR HOME BY THE MEN AND WOMEN OF SPALDING\\". The frieze inside the pavilion contains a further inscription: \\"ETERNAL REST GRANT TO THEM O LORD AND LET LIGHT PERPETUAL SHINE UPON THEM\\".Pevsner, p. 676. A separate stone is dedicated to Francis McLaren and inscribed \\"THIS STONE COMMEMORATES FRANCIS WALTER STAFFORD McLAREN MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE SPALDING DIVISION 1910‚Äì1917 WHEN HE FELL IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF 31\\". A Stone of Remembrance is sited on a platform of three steps in front of the pavilion, inscribed with the phrase \\"THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE\\" and the dates of the two world wars (the dates of the Second World War were added at a later date, though the names of the casualties from that conflict were not). The stone is carved from a single piece of rock, with very slight curvature (entasis) barely visible to the naked eye. It is long and devoid of any decoration besides the inscription. A long pool leads away from the structures‚Äîoriginally a canal from the garden first recorded in 1732, which Lutyens remodelled to form a reflecting pool in the style of an Italian formal garden; three low fountains were added at a later date. The pavilion and the pool are surrounded by yew hedges, which on the east side are broken at regular intervals by iron gates which lead to a peace garden, added in 1994.Ridley, p. 278. The view of the pavilion at the head of the reflecting pool is reminiscent of Bodnant Garden at Lord Aberconway's home in Wales, Francis McLaren's childhood home.Skelton, p. 56. Impact By the time the memorial at Spalding was unveiled in 1922, Lutyens had already been engaged in work on First World War memorials in Britain and abroad for several years. He had designed The Cenotaph on Whitehall in London (the permanent version of which was unveiled in 1920), which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations. His work from 1917 for the Imperial War Graves Commission (eventually as one of the Principal Architects for France and Belgium) included the Stone of Remembrance (used in the first cemeteries from 1920) and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing (unveiled in 1932)‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world. The Cenotaph and Lutyens's connections from his pre-war work designing country houses led to commissions for dozens of war memorials across Britain and elsewhere in the Commonwealth. His initial design for Spalding was one of several of Lutyens's early post-war commissions featured in a war memorials exhibition hosted by the Royal Academy at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1919.Skelton, p. 151. Historic England described Spalding as \\"an exceptional departure\\" from the usual style of Lutyens's war memorials. The design is not used elsewhere in his war memorials, but the pavilion had a significant influence on Lutyens's later designs for buildings in Imperial War Graves Commission cemeteries on the Western Front. The resemblance is said to be \\"striking\\" at Anneux British Cemetery, Cambrai, and the Tuscan loggia motif recurs at several other cemeteries as well.Geurst, p. 198. Spalding's memorial became relatively obscure, and was not covered extensively in any publication about Lutyens's works until the publication of Tim Skelton's Lutyens and the Great War in 2008.Skelton, p. 11. Barbara McLaren later married Bernard Freyberg, an officer in the Royal Naval Division, which Skelton speculates may have led to Lutyens's commission for the Royal Naval Division Memorial on Horse Guards Parade in London.Skelton, p. 91. The memorial was designated a Grade II listed building in November 1975. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens's war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries updated and expanded. As part of this process, Spalding War Memorial was upgraded to Grade I. Ayscoughfee Hall itself is also listed at Grade I, while the gardens are listed at Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.

Trullinger (b.1828) built the Minnehaha on the eastern or \\"upper\\" end of Sucker Lake, near a sawmill owned by the Oswego Milling Company. Engineering Minnehaha was driven by a stern-wheel, which was turned by twin steam engines removed from the steam scow Skedaddle, which had been built in 1862 on the Tualatin River. The size of the engines has been variously reported. An 1871 source states that each engine had an internal cylinder diameter, called a \\"bore\\" of and the distance traveled by the piston, called the \\"stroke\\" of . Minnehaha had a locomotive-type boiler 14 feet long, which was described as \\"nearly new\\" in September 1871. The size of the firebox was reported to have been 4.5 feet by 3 feet. Dimensions Minnehaha was long, exclusive of the extension of the main deck over the stern, called the fantail, on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The beam (width) of Minnehaha was exclusive of the protective timbers along the upper sides of the hull, called the guards. The depth of hold was . In 1874, Minnehaha measured out at 103.63 gross tons, which was a measure of volume and not weight. The official merchant registry number in 1874 was 90084. Operations=Other steamers on the lake= Minnehaha was the only steamer ever launched upon Sucker Lake. However, Minnehaha was not the only steam vessel ever to operate on the lake; the others were built on the Tualatin River and transferred to the lake. The small (20 gross tons) Henrietta operating on the lake in 1870. The much larger sternwheeler Onward made at least one trip on Sucker Lake, on January 21, 1873, reaching the lake from the Tualatin through a canal which had recently been completed on the west, or \\"upper\\" end of the lake. =Sucker Lake service= Minnehaha made its trial trip on October 24, 1866, under Captain Richard Copely. In October 1866, Minnehaha became part of a transportation route to Washington County, Oregon which sought to avoid the navigation barrier then formed by Willamette Falls. According to a contemporaneous report, the plan for the route would be that the Senator would run to Oswego, on the Willamette River, where passengers would disembark, and cross over to Sucker Lake, as Lake Oswego was then known, and board Minnehaha. The lake boat then paddled across the water to the lake‚Äôs western end, where it was reported, passengers would be taken to Colfax, on the Tualatin River \\"by cars\\". Once at Colfax, the steamer Yamhill, with Captain Kellogg in charge, would \\"be in readiness.\\" The Yamhill would then steam up the Tualatin River, with, it was projected, excursionists, as far as Taylor‚Äôs Bridge. Taylor Bridge was about six miles upriver from Colfax. While it earned some praise in a newspaper of the time, this route proved to have many problems in practice: Minnehaha was continuing to run on Sucker Lake on February 11, 1869. Transfer to Willamette River It was possible to bring a steamboat down Sucker Creek from Sucker Creek to the Willamette River, if appropriate measures were taken, including the building of a coffer dam in the abandoned mill race. James D. Miller did this with the Onward. With the Oswego‚ÄìTualatin canal not completed until 1872, a similar procedure would likely have had to have been followed, between February 11, 1869 and early September 1871, to bring Minnehaha to the Willamette River. =Sale at Auction= In September 1871, Minnehaha was sold at auction, either by the sheriff or, more likely, by A.B. Richardson, auctioneer. The auction was conducted on the Minnehaha itself, at the dock at the foot of Morrison Street in Portland, Oregon. The purchaser at the auction was Barney Train, of East Portland. =Willamette and Columbia river service= In 1874, Minnehaha was engaged in light towing service on the lower Willamette and Columbia rivers. Disposition Minnehaha was dismantled in 1876 at Portland.

It premiered on FOX on January 19, 2015 and was written by Ben Edlund, and directed by Eagle Egilsson. In this episode, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) looks to capture a prisoner who escaped from Arkham Asylum to get his job back. Meanwhile, Falcone (John Doman) struggles to hold his empire when someone beloved to him takes an unexpected turn. The episode was watched by 6.50 million viewers and received mixed-to-positive reviews. Critics praised Gordon's storyline but criticized the anti-climax. Plot Jack Gruber (Christopher Heyerdahl) and Aaron Danzig (Kevin McCormick) arrive at an electronics store, testing on the owner, Irwin (Adrian Martinez). In the GCPD, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) makes a deal with Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (Peter Scolari) to get his detective badge back if he catches Gruber in 24 hours. They arrive at the electronics store, where they find Irwin writing \\"I will not betray my friends\\" on the walls. In the GCPD, Dr. \\"Lee\\" Thompkins (Morena Baccarin) arrives, planning on working on the case. Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) reveals Gruber is an alias and his real name is Jack Buchinsky, having bribed a guard to change his name. He gives Gordon and Bullock (Donal Logue) overshoes to avoid electricity. Lee reveals that killers make elaborate dolls of their victims, one of the victims turning out to be Maroni. Buchinsky attacks his restaurant with an electrical bomb, knocking out Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), but causing minimal damage. When he wakes up, Cobblepot is confronted by Maroni, who suspects he's working with Falcone (John Doman). When he tries to leave, Buchinsky electrocutes the GCPD, knocking everyone unconscious. When he looks for Maroni, Gordon (using the overshoes) fights with him and spills water on his device, shutting it off. He arrests Buchinsky and gets his detective rank. While walking, Liza (Makenzie Leigh) is abducted. She's relieved when the kidnapper turns out to be Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith), telling her she's doing her move against Falcone. Mooney calls Falcone, threatening to hurt Liza if he doesn't retire. Falcone agrees to her terms as long as he and Liza leave for Sicily. Cobblepot arrives with Falcone and reveals to him that Liza is the mole in his organization, as Mooney employed her for her likeness to Falcone's mother. Falcone visits Mooney's nightclub. He refuses to his terms and reveals about her truce. He has Mooney and Butch (Drew Powell) locked up and heartbroken, strangles Liza to death. He gives the nightclub to Cobblepot as Mooney and Butch are taken away. In GCPD, Gordon and Lee talk, which culminates in a kiss. Reception=Viewers= The episode was watched by 6.50 million viewers, with a 2.2 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 9.99 million viewers, and a 3.8 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"What the Little Bird Told Him\\" received mixed-to-positive reviews. The episode received a rating of 64% with an average score of 6.5 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"The character work in 'What the Little Bird Told Him,' along with the comeuppance of the Electrocutioner, are strong enough to overcome the anti-climactic face- off between Fish and Carmine Falcone.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"okay\\" 6.4 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"I almost want to forgive the head-scratching moments from this week's Electrocutioner story since Gothams usual M.O. for these types of villain cases is to dumb things down. Easy investigation, few bits of action, easy capture. But the Fish/Falcone story has been building since the first episode and it was a big let down. Never once did the show convince me that Falcone was so enraptured with Liza that he'd quit his life for her, nor did it ever show me Fish feeling anything but contempt for Falcone. She's killed so many people in her schemes to get to him...but she won't kill him? She'll leave her most powerful enemy alive? Possibly to return later on for revenge?\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Maybe I‚Äôm projecting Gotham‚Äôs season one extension onto this episode‚Äìor maybe I‚Äôm putting too much stock into the number ‚Äú12‚Äù that designates this episode‚Äìbut ‚ÄúWhat The Little Bird Told Him‚Äù sure feels like a penultimate episode of television.

In traditional manufacturing and fabrication, there are physical and precision limitations on a workpiece; namely, lower minimal dimension of a workpiece has been a major challenge in modern manufacturing. Engineering self-assembly methods have a significant potentials in overcoming the dimensional limitation of a workpiece. In general, there are three key ingredients in most of self assembly applications: geometry (order), interaction, energy. To improve the efficiency or take shape in self-assembly based manufacturing, it must utilize one or more than one of these three ingredients. This is an emerging market with few examples to date. However, this field shows a strong potential to revolutionize many industrial markets from nanoelectronics to bio-engineering.  Successful processes  Automated reel to reel fluidic self-assembly machine based on surface-tension-directed- self-assembly. Many processes have been successfully developed at laboratory scale and show promise for future expansion into large-scale industrial manufacturing. * Sequence-specific molecular lithography on single DNA molecules * Direct molecular assembly on metal surfaces * Amyloid fibers and selective metal deposition: NM protein fibers have been demonstrated to create nanowires useful in connecting electrodes in laboratory testing. * Surface- tension-directed-self-assembly of electronic components. One example is the automated reel to reel fluidic self-assembly machine demonstrated by University of Minnesota researchers. The machine was designed to produce lighting panels using Light-emitting diodes. Assembly was performed at twice the hourly rate of commercially available pick and place machines for SMT placement equipment, 15,000 chips per hour compared to 8,000 chips per hour. At the same time, the self-assembly exceeded the accuracy rate of the pick and place machine as well.  Potential future applications  Fabrication of materials used in most extreme environments, such as space, high altitude, free-fall scenarios, or deep sea. environments have advantageous conditions for allowing increase in self assembly interaction with less or minimum energy consumption. Applications in these environments often require high precision and have more difficulties; however, it has less constraints in existing construction.

Hotspots of SLR can divert 3-4 times in the rate of rise, compared to the global average, such as projected for parts of the U.S. East Coast. Climate-related security risks have far-reaching implications for the way the world manages peace and security. Climate security is a concept that summons the idea that climate- related change amplifies existing risks in society that endangers the security of humans, ecosystems, economy, infrastructure and societies. Also climate actions to adapt and mitigate impacts can have a negative effect on human security if mishandled. General Climate security refers to the security risks induced, directly or indirectly, by changes in climate patterns. The Global Risks Report 2019 by the World Economic Forum, cited climate change among the most concerning issues. As part of the report a survey cited extreme weather, lack of climate action and natural disasters as the main three problems. The 2017 Global Catastrophic Risks report, issued by the Global Challenges Foundation, highlighted a broad range of security-related topics, among them climate change, and concluded that global warming has a high likelihood to end civilization. The Global Security Defense Index on climate change evaluates the extents of governments in considering climate change to be a national security issue. Policy interest in climate security risks has grown rapidly and affects the policy agenda in relation to, among other questions, food and energy security, migration policy, and diplomatic efforts. Recognizing that the impact of climate change is spread unevenly across different regions, it remains clear that this is a global challenge which will affect all countries in the long-term. However, there may a disproportional effect in fragile contexts and/or socially vulnerable and marginalized groups. USDA, projected changes in food prices, depending on emissions scenarios, also factoring trade The 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment report states: According to studies on climate security it is often difficult to determine whether security and conflict issues in many countries and regions may occur , or can be attributed to climate change or climate related issues due to the presence of many factors such as ethnic tension, regional resolution tactics to issues, and outside powers placing pressures on countries being the possible reason for the conflict.  Academia  Within academia, climate security is part of environmental security and was first mentioned in the Brundtland Report in 1987. Thirty years later, experts and scientists in fields as politics, diplomacy, environment and security have used this concept in an increasing frequency. Climate security refers to the security risks induced, directly or indirectly, by changes in the natural climate. There is high agreement that climate change intimidates security where the term ‚Äòsecurity‚Äô can refer to a broad range of securities involving national, international and Human Security. Human Security is the most fragile as it can be compromised in order to protect national or international security. Scholars analysing conflicts with a climate security rendering have long argued that climate change can adversely affect security and international stability. Research has examined ‚Äòindirect pathways between climate stress and conflict‚Äô ‚Äî through factors like economic growth, food price shock and forced displacement apart from other types of shock such as: income and livelihood shock (with the accompanying caveats in the table). Climate change can threaten human security by impacting economic growth, food price stock, undermining livelihoods, and prompting displacement. Moreover, there has been reports of collapse of pastoral societies, terrorist groups seeking recruits in dehydrated lands, and flooding ultimately feeding anti-government sentiments. Unstable regions appear to be incapable of surviving climate change-related stresses; instead creating fertile soil for radicalisation, poverty and violent conflict. Scholars of climate security can analyse the chronological order of an escalation, where a changing environment or climate change can be an underlying variable. It is a complex interplay of many political and socio-economical factors where climate change is considered a risk-or threat-multiplier. During the 70's and 80's the Jason advisory group, concerned with security, conducted research on climate change. Climate change has been identified as a threat multiplier, which can exacerbate existing threats. A 2013 meta-analysis of 60 previous peer-reviewed studies, and 45 data sets concluded that, \\"climate change intensifies natural resource stresses in a way that can increase the likelihood of livelihood devastation, state fragility, human displacement, and mass death.\\" In the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), The Pentagon stated: \\"The QDR will set a long-term course for DOD as it assesses the threats and challenges that the nation faces and re-balances DOD‚Äôs strategies, capabilities, and forces to address today‚Äôs conflicts and tomorrow‚Äôs threats.\\" and \\" \\"As greenhouse gas emissions increase, sea levels are rising, average global temperatures are increasing, and severe weather patterns are accelerating [...] Climate change may exacerbate water scarcity and lead to sharp increases in food costs. The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world. These effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions ‚Äì conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.\\" Climate scientist Michael E. Mann stated in his commentary to the 2018 global heat wave that climate change is a national security nightmare. Climate change A report in 2003 by Peter Schwartz and Doug Randall, looked at potential implications from climate- related scenarios for the national security of the United States, and concluded, \\"We have created a climate change scenario that although not the most likely, is plausible, and would challenge United States national security in ways that should be considered immediately.\\" Among the findings were: Researchers studying ancient climate patterns (paleoclimatology) noted in a 2007 study: A 2013 review by the U.S. National Research Council assessed the implications of abrupt climate change, including implications for the physical climate system, natural systems, or human systems. The authors noted, \\"A key characteristic of these changes is that they can come faster than expected, planned, or budgeted for, forcing more reactive, rather than proactive, modes of behavior.\\" A 2018 meta study cited cascading tipping elements, which could trigger self-reinforcing feedbacks that progress even when man-made emissions are reduced, and which could eventually establish a new hothouse climate state. The authors noted, \\"If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies.\\" =Health= Studies identified uptake in mortality due to extreme heat waves. Extreme heat conditions can overcome the human capacity to thermo regulate; future scenarios with rising emissions could expose about 74% of the world population for at least twenty days per year to lethal heat events. =Psychological impacts= A 2011 article in the American Psychologist identified three classes of psychological impacts from global climate change: *Direct - \\"Acute or traumatic effects of extreme weather events and a changed environment\\" *Indirect - \\"Threats to emotional well-being based on observation of impacts and concern or uncertainty about future risks\\" *Psychosocial - \\"Chronic social and community effects of heat, drought, migrations, and climate-related conflicts, and postdisaster adjustment\\" Consequences of psychosocial impacts caused by climate change include: increase in violence, intergroup conflict, displacement and relocation and socioeconomic disparities. Based on research, there is a causal relationship between heat and violence and that any increase in average global temperature is likely to be accompanied by an increase in violent aggression. =Conflicts= Since climate change has serious and broad implications for societies and human livelihoods, the potential security consequences are far- reaching and complex. The topic started to receive major attention in 2007 when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for their efforts to mitigate climate change. In the same year, the UN Security Council held its first debate on climate change and security, with follow-up debates on the topic in 2012, 2018 and 2019. In an early study on the topic, the German Advisory Council on Global Change identified four pathways potentially connecting climate change to conflict: degradation of freshwater resources, food insecurity, an increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, and increasing or changing migration patterns. These factors can reportedly increase the risk of violent conflict by, for instance, changing opportunity structures for violence (e.g., when states are weakened or deprived individuals can be recruited by armed groups more easily) or exacerbating the grievances of affected populations. In a 2016 article, published by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the author suggested that conflict over climate-related water issues could lead to nuclear conflict, involving Kashmir, India and Pakistan. But while some scholars agree that climate change are unlikely to have major impacts on the nature of interstate wars, concerns have been raised about its impacts on civil wars and communal conflicts. Based on a meta-analysis of 60 studies, Hsiang, Burke and Miguel conclude that warmer temperatures and more extreme rainfall could increase interpersonal violence by 4%, and intergroup conflict by 14% (median estimates). However, their results have been disputed by other researchers as being not sufficiently robust to alternative model specifications. Recent studies have been more careful and agree that climate- related disasters (including heatwaves, droughts, storms and floods) modestly increase armed conflict risks, but only in the presence of contextual factors like agricultural dependence, insufficient infrastructure or ethnic heterogeneity. Climate change is therefore rather a \\"risk multiplier\\" that amplifies existing risks of conflict. In line with this and other reviews of the topic, an expert assessment published 2019 in Nature concludes that between 3% and 20% of intrastate, armed conflict risks in the previous century were affected by climate-related factors, but that other drivers of conflict are far more important. The expert assessment itself notes that major knowledge gaps and uncertainties continue to exist in the research field, especially regarding the pathways connecting climate change to conflict risk. Selby argues that the assessment ignores critical or constructivist approaches. Indeed, there are a number of studies that criticize how climate- conflict research is based on a deterministic and conflict-oriented worldview and that findings of statistical studies on the topic are based on problematic models and biased datasets. Existing research also predominantly focuses on a few, well-known and already conflict-ridden regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. This raises questions about sampling biases, implications for regions like Latin America and the Pacific, with topics such as peaceful adaptation and environmental peacebuilding also understudied. The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report also notes that several factors that increase general conflict risk are sensitive to climate change, but that there is no direct and simple causal association between nature and society. Even so, several case studies have linked climate change to increased violent conflicts between farmers and herders in Kenya, Nigeria and Sudan, but have found mixed results for Mali and Tanzania. Evidence is also ambiguous and highly contested for high-intensity conflicts such as civil wars. Claims have been put forward that climate change-related droughts, in combination with other factors, had facilitated the civil war in Darfur, the Arab Spring in Egypt, the Syrian civil war, the Islamist insurgency in Nigeria, and the Somali civil war. Yet some studies have suggested that there is very little evidence for several of these causal claims, including for the cases of Darfur, Egypt, Syria, and Ghana. Adaptation Setup of a solar shade canopy for humanitarian aid and disaster relief. The solar shade has the potential to provide enough energy for continuous 24-hour use. =Energy= At least since 2010, the U.S. military begun to push aggressively to develop, evaluate and deploy renewable energy to decrease its need to transport fossil fuels. Based on the 2015 annual report from NATO, the alliance plans investments in renewables and energy efficiency to reduce risks to soldiers, and cites the impacts from climate change on security as a reason. Political discourse The transnational character of climate-related security risks often goes beyond the capacity of national governments to respond adequately. Many parts of governments or state leaders acknowledge climate change as an issue for human security, national or regional security: = United Nations = Although climate change is first and foremost dealt within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and now also under the Paris agreement, the security implications of climate change do not have an institutional home within the United Nations system, and hence remain largely unaddressed, in spite of the urgency of the threat it poses to peace and security in several regions. The UN, through its COP - The Conference of the Parties - is the supreme body to negotiate climate frameworks under the UNFCCC Convention. It consists of the representatives of the Parties to the Convention and holds its sessions every year, and takes decisions which are necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of the Convention and regularly reviews the implementation of these provisions.Preventing ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù human interference with the climate system is the ultimate aim of the UNFCCC. The UNFCCC is a ‚ÄúRio Convention‚Äù, one of three adopted at the ‚ÄúRio Earth Summit‚Äù in 1992. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994. Today, it has near- universal membership. The COP has discussed Climate Security during panels, workshops as session, but not as a programmatic track. The greater focus on this topic by the UN has led to the launch in October 2018 of the inter-agency DPPA-UNDP-UN Environment cooperation called the ‚ÄòClimate Security Mechanism‚Äô.Smith, D., Mobj√∂rk, M., Krampe, F., Ekl√∂w, K., ‚ÄòClimate Security Making it #Doable‚Äô, Clingendael report (Feb. 2019), p. 14.  United Nations Security Council  The UN Security Council first debated climate security and energy in 2007 and in 2011 issued a presidential statement expressing concern at the possible adverse security effects of climate change. There has been a series of informal Arria-Formula meetings on issues related to climate change. In July 2018, Sweden initiated a debate on Climate and Security in the United Nations Security Council. Climate change grew beyond its categorisation as a hypothetical, existential risk and became an operational concern of relevance to other peace and security practitioners beyond the diplomats in the Security Council. = European Union (EU) = The European Council‚Äôs conclusions on climate diplomacy state that \\"Climate change is a decisive global challenge which, if not urgently managed, will put at risk ... peace, stability and security.\\" The Intelligence on European Pensions and Institutional Investment think-tank published a 2018 report with the key point, \\"Climate change is an existential risk whose elimination must become a corporate objective\\". In June 2018 European External Action Service (EEAS) High-Level Event hosted an event themed \\"Climate, Peace and Security: The Time for Action\\". The EU's comprehensive approach to security would suggest that the EU is well placed to respond to climate-related security risks. However, recent scientific research shows that the European Union has not yet developed a fully coherent policy. = NATO = NATO stated in 2015 that climate change is a significant security threat and that ‚ÄòIts bite is already being felt‚Äô. = United States = US intelligence analysts have expressed concern about the \\"serious security risks\\" of climate change since the 1980s. In 2007, the Council on Foreign Relations released a report titled, Climate Change and National Security: An Agenda for Action, stating that \\"Climate change presents a serious threat to the security and prosperity of the United States and other countries.\\" A 2012 report published by the Joint Global Change Research Institute indicated that second and third order impacts of climate change, such as migration and state stability, are of concern for the US defense and intelligence communities. A 2015 report published by the White House found that climate change puts coastal areas at risk, that a changing Arctic poses risks to other parts of the country, risk for infrastructure, and increases demands on military resources. In 2016, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper noted: \\"Unpredictable instability has become the ‚Äúnew normal,‚Äù and this trend will continue for the foreseeable future‚Ä¶Extreme weather, climate change, environmental degradation, rising demand for food and water, poor policy decisions and inadequate infrastructure will magnify this instability.\\" A 2015 Pentagon report pointed out how climate denial threatens national security. In 2017, the Trump administration removed climate change from its national security strategy. But in January 2019 the Pentagon released a report stating that climate change is a national security threat to USA. In June 2019, in the course of House Select Committee on Intelligence hearings on the national security implications of climate change, the White House blocked the submission of a statement by the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research Office, and the analyst who wrote the statement resigned. The idea of creating a presidential committee on climate security has been proposed. As part of the United States National Defense Authorization Act the U.S. Congress asked the Department of Defense for a report on climate matters. The report was published in 2019, and notes, \\"The effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) missions, operational plans, and installations.\\" =Australia= A 2018 published report by the Australian Senate noted how \\"climate change as a current and existential national security risk‚Ä¶ defined as one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development.\\" = United Kingdom = In 2014, David Cameron noted that \\"Climate change is one of the most serious threats facing our world\\". A 2018 article in UK's The Independent also argued that the U.S.' Trump administration is ‚Äòputting British national security at risk‚Äô, according to over 100 climate scientists. Culture= Documentary = The 2010 documentary, Carbon Nation explores climate change solutions. The Guardian noted about Carbon Nation, \\"The take-home message is that what's good for the climate is also good for the economy, for national security, for health, for nature ‚Äì and for America.\\" The documentary The Burden presents the argument for a switch from fossil fuel reliance to clean energy from a military perspective. Bob Inglis is quoted, \\"I see incredible opportunity.... We improve our national security. We create jobs and we clean up the air.\\" = Celebrities = In 2014, Leonardo DiCaprio stated during a United Nations conference, \\"The time to answer the greatest challenge of our existence on this planet is now. You can make history or be vilified by it.\\" At a 2015 security conference, Arnold Schwarzenegger called climate change the issue of our time.

The railroad runs between Kutztown and Topton in Berks County. Operations The Allentown & Auburn Railroad operates both a freight railroad and a tourist railroad. The Allentown & Auburn Railroad line is long and runs between Kutztown and an interchange with Norfolk Southern Railway's Reading Line in Topton. The Kutztown Transportation Authority owns the tracks that the Allentown & Auburn Railroad operates on. The tourist railroad operates out of a station in Kutztown during holidays and special occasions on the weekends. Among the occasions the railroad has operated for include an Easter train, the Kutztown Folk Festival, the Kutztown Bicentennial Celebration, Halloween trick-or-treating, Christmas tree picking, and a Santa Claus train. The Allentown & Auburn Railroad allows groups to charter an entire train for an excursion. The excursion takes between 45 minutes and an hour, passing through farmland. The Allentown & Auburn Railroad operates with a diesel locomotive, three cabooses, one coach, and an open flatcar. The diesel locomotive used by the railroad is the second oldest in service and was built in 1937. The Allentown & Auburn Railroad operated a steam locomotive for the Kutztown Bicentennial Celebration. History The Allentown & Auburn Railroad dates back to 1853 when a charter was issued to the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company and the Central Railroad of New Jersey for the Allentown Railroad, a railroad that was to run from Allentown west to the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company mainline between Port Clinton and Auburn. Construction began on the Allentown Railroad in 1855, with the railroad planned to run from Allentown southwest to Topton and then northwest through Kutztown, Virginville, and Hamburg to Port Clinton. The CNJ was planning on abandoning the Allentown Railroad project for another route by way of Reading. The remaining investors carried on with the project. The Allentown Railroad and the Auburn & Port Clinton Railroad merged on January 1, 1857. The project was halted by the Panic of 1857 and the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company was foreclosed and became part of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company- controlled Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad on April 1, 1859. The East Pennsylvania Railroad opened on May 11, 1859, connecting Allentown and Reading. As a result, the Allentown Railroad project was abandoned as traffic could move between Allentown and Reading on the East Pennsylvania Railroad and north to Auburn along the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company main line. In the early 1870s, the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company laid track along the grade of the Allentown Railroad between Kutztown and the East Pennsylvania Railroad in Topton. The Allentown Railroad was formally merged into the Reading Co. on December 31, 1945. Following the bankruptcy and consolidation of the Reading Co. into Conrail, the Kutztown Transportation Authority took over the line. The East Penn Railroad later operated freight service on the line between Kutztown and Topton. In 2013, Lindsay and Michael Bast, the latter a volunteer at the Reading Railroad Museum, took over operation of the railroad line between Kutztown and Topton after freight service on the tracks ended following the closure of a foundry. In March 2015, the Allentown & Auburn Railroad began tourist operations.

This baseboard can be so small as to look as if it would fit into a pizza box, hence the name. Pizza layouts are not serious scale models, but are to provide a little humour. Despite their simplicity, they are rarely built by beginners but are usually light relief for an experienced modeller. As they are quick to build and lower budget they are often used as a theme for exhibitions and contests. Many are also seasonally themed, such as Christmas layouts. They often provide an opportunity to experiment with a different gauge and scale from a modeller's regular. A more sophisticated pizza layout in O9 gauge, with highly detailed scenery Building this minimum-size layout requires a small gauge. Most pizzas use 9mm gauge, as for N gauge. Z gauge and the esoteric smaller gauges would be useful too, but their costs are more than 9mm and there are fewer options available. Other gauges up to the popular H0/OO 16.5mm gauge are also used, but almost only as narrow gauge models. Most pizzas model narrow gauge railways. This combines the narrow physical gauge needed with a larger and more visible scale. Narrow gauge prototypes also have short wheelbases, slow running speeds and so are often more accepting of tight curve radii. Where standard gauge is modelled, this is only for N, Z or smaller gauges, H0 requiring a size greater than the usual 'pizza' format, although this can just be achieved in 2' diameter. For an 00-9 or H0e pizza, using 9mm gauge and either 4mm or 3.5mm scale, a workable minimum curve radius is 6\\", for an overall baseboard diameter of , within the pizza box format. Some model companies, such as Tomix, even produce extra-small radius curves of 4\\" radius, for modelling trams. These have been used to model at N gauge within a 9\\" baseboard. Gn15 gauge models one of the smallest prototypical gauges, 15 inch minimum gauge railways. This gives the greatest combination of small curve radius and largest scale. Nn3 Z gauge Z gauge has even been used to make layouts inside a large glass bottle. The layout is a simple circular loop. Points are limited to just one, perhaps two, small sidings and these are more decorative than useful for shunting. A siding to the outside of the loop requires a larger baseboard. A siding inside the loop may do so too: the siding's radius must be smaller than that of the running loop, which is already close to the minimum radius. Allowing the loop to be a little larger, so as to permit a tighter siding curve within it, means a larger loop and baseboard. This can be done most compactly by stretching the circular loop to an oval, but keeping the same radius with an added straight; the point comes off the straight portion. In rare cases, a fiddle yard has been incorporated into a hidden part of the layout. Although rare, some pizza layouts have also used multi-level spiral layouts, with something of the rabbit warren to them.  Scenery  Scenery may be realistic, a caricature of geography containing real buildings or deliberately unrealistic. The difficulty is the likelihood that all of the layout can be seen at once, and the problem of finding any sort of visual break between the two sides. Many simply ignore this, placing a realistic building or feature in the centre and ignoring the logical pointlessness of a railway that obviously circles without going anywhere. Some layouts model funfairs, where the short circle can appear purposeful. A popular approach is to place a large visual break in the centre of the layout, such as a hill or quarry working. This has the advantage of stopping the layout look so obviously a loop, but at the risk of looking like a wedding cake with an arbitrary hill in the middle. Many alpine or mining layouts have hidden half of the loop beneath tunnels.

It is one of the three major varieties of grape in the state of Karnataka (the other two being Thomson seedless and Anab-E-Shahi Dilkush). It received a geographical indication tag from the Government of India in 2013. History The variety has been grown for the past 150 years in the districts of Bangalore Urban, Chikkaballapur and Kolar. It is cultivated exclusively in an area of about 5,000 hectares, mainly in the Nandi Valley; and about 450,000 tonnes of the fruit are produced annually. Appearance and uses Bangalore Blue is closely related to the American Concord variety which has a strong natural resistance against phylloxera bugs. The variety has a \\"foxy flavor\\" and a soft skin. It is known to have anti-cancer and anti-ageing properties, as demonstrated by modern research. The ideal conditions needed to grow Bangalore Blue are: soil of red sandy loam type, day temperature of 35 ¬∞C to 37 ¬∞C and night temperature of 12 ¬∞C to 15 ¬∞C. As these conditions are found around the Bangalore region, the variety is grown exclusively there. The grape is mainly used for raw consumption, making jams and jellies, juice and juice concentrates; and in fortified wines. Geographical indication The Department of Horticulture proposed the registration of Bangalore Blue under the Geographical Indications of Goods Act, 1999, to the Office of the Controller-General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, Chennai, in order to make it exclusive to the farmers in the region and increase its brand value. It was granted the Geographical indication status, three years later, in 2013.

The central theme of the book is state formation. Tilly writes about the complex history of European state formation from the Middle Ages to the 1990s - a thousand-year time span. While examining political, social, and technological change, Tilly attempts to explain the unprecedented success of the European nation-state as the dominant polity in the world, claiming that \\"the origins of the modern European state lay in war and preparations for war.\\"  Overview  According to Tilly, the French Revolution unfolded from protests against the high taxes the French rulers imposed to balance for the expensive American War. Tilly asks a double question in Coercion, Capital, and European States, namely: \\"What accounts for the great variation over time and space in the kinds of states that have prevailed in Europe since AD 990, and why did European states eventually converge on different variants of the national state?\\" According to Tilly's theory, military innovation in pre-modern Europe, especially the use of gunpowder and mass armies, made war considerably more expensive. In order to continue to fund warfare, conquest, and security, only states with sufficient capital and a large population could afford paying for their security and ultimately surviving in a hostile environment. Those in power were forced to develop a means of extraction by, for example, introducing taxation and conscription. Subsequently, these means of extraction resulted in the creation of state bureaucracies and a centralized state. The type of state that develops is dependent on the structure of the area. In areas where merchants and capital were the predominant class, city states arose, such as Venice. In areas where independent landlords were the predominant class, centralized absolutism arose, such as Russia. If an area would have both classes more or less equal, a combination of state forms would develop, for example as happened in France and England, according to Tilly. Eventually, all states will develop into the type of state form that Tilly calls the nation state. With this theory, Tilly questions previous formulations of state development in Europe, arguing that they are unsuccessful in explaining the great variety in kinds of states that have prevailed at different stages of European history since AD 990. He say that they fail \\"because they locate explanations of state-to-state variation in individual characteristics of states rather than relations among them, and because they assume implicitly a deliberate effect to construct the sorts of substantial, centralized states that come to dominate European life during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\\" Unlike other theories, like the idea of the social contract, Tilly stated that \\"[w]ar wove the European network of national states, and preparation for war created the internal structures of states within it.\\" Interaction between the rulers on one hand and the manipulators of capital on the other, resulted in three state formations, Tilly argues. These state formations are tribute-taking empires, systems of fragmented sovereignty, and national states. = From Militarization to Civilianization = Tilly notes a \\"central paradox\\" in his theory of European state building: \\"the pursuit of war and military capacity, after having created national states as a sort of by-product, led to a civilianization of government and domestic politics\\". According to Tilly, this transfer of power from armed forces to civilian entities was not so much a tug-of-war but rather happened incrementally. The nature of power‚Äîcoercion‚Äîdid not change, but the individuals that wielded it did. Tilly provides five main reasons for this incremental transition (p. 206): # The building up and maintenance of military forces required massive extractive structures that were run by civilians, eventually forming a counterweight to the same military forces; # War making forced states to legitimize civilian input since it had to bargain for necessary resources with civilian entities; # War making dramatically expanded the state and did not downsize its capacities at the end of conflicts; # Individuals involved in war making were promised dues at the end of the war, and thus legitimately claimed their dues at demobilization; # Borrowing during conflicts led to bureaucracies being created to service the skyrocketing state debts, which in turn encouraged states to intervene in the local economy. = State Building in the Developing World = Jeffrey Herbst is an example of a scholar that builds on Tilly's theory. Herbst explains the relative failure of state building in Africa by the lack of external threats that forced European leaders to concentrate capital and power. Tilly concludes his book, however, emphasizing caution in applying his model to contemporary state-building. Tilly argues that the militarization of politics in many developing countries should not be understood as a step towards the development of a stable nation state. He asserts that current conditions of state formation today (at the time of writing, in 1990) are vastly different from what they were in Europe over his study period. First, Tilly notes that the military apparatus in developing countries today is not generally concerned with conquering or defending territory, as opposed to European armies (p. 207). Thus, they turn their full capacity to internal control, so that the objective is not to control territory but populations. Second, Tilly writes that the Cold War has led to a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to arm, fund and control developing countries, especially their militaries. Thus, military groups thrived as other organizations withered. Progressively, the military was better able to control the state, whereas civilian organizations could not rival its strength. In other words, Tilly argues that the military groups that run contemporary developing states have little in common with their European counterparts. He further proposes three hypothesis to start to theorize the lack of civilianization in developing countries (p. 220): # Failure of civilian institutions that lead to military intervention; # Disproportionate external support for the military; # No institutional tool to bargain and contain the military since it is artificially funded externally. Tilly's main claim is thus that the European nation-state as it was constructed is certainly not a de facto endgame, or ideal polity model. In fact, Tilly argues that it is improbable that current Third World states follow exactly the same processus of state building- and we should not expect them to do so.  Reception = Academic discussion = Tarrow, 2008  American sociologist Sidney Tarrow discussed the book during a 2008 conference organized by the Social Science Research Council in honor of Charles Tilly. During his talk, he addressed what he saw as four gaps in the book: # The scope conditions of Tilly's theory. War is seen by Tilly as the \\"prime mover of early modern European state-making, because its requisites led to processes of extraction, protection, production, and distribution.\\" However, Tarrow wonders how that can explain non-European states and states that formed more recently, such as post-colonial states. There is a lot of literature on \\"correcting Tilly\\" on state-building in the global South and elsewhere. # The theory's internal validity. In the 1975 book The Formation of National States in Western Europe, Tilly critiques Joseph Strayer's model of state formation. However, in Coercion, Capital, and European States, \\"the successful cases looked remarkably like Strayer's model.\\" # There is no attention for the role of religion and capitalism in European state development, while Tarrow argues \\"[w]e know how deeply Catholic/Protestant conflicts divided Europe in the Thirty Year's War, and how the settlement of that conflict produced the European state system after the Treaty of Westphalia.\\" Concerning capitalism, Tarrow said that \\"not all European states were equally in need of domestic capital to finance their wars\\", referring to Sweden under King Gustav III. # The role of rights in state development in the United States, characterized by the so-called \\"War on Terror\\". According to Tarrow, Tilly \\"saw his country at risk of abandoning its devotion to its regime of rights.\\"  Leander, 2004  French/Swedish sociologist Anna Leander examined Tilly's relevance twenty years later in her article Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World. Leander argues that the \\"war makes states\\" no longer holds for four reasons: # State-building. While rulers' competition for controlling coercion is a crucial element of Tilly's hypothesis, today's rulers \\"take increasingly minor roles in the organization of coercion\\". State-building is not a product of interstate conflict anymore but rather of diplomacy and high-politics. # Privatization of coercion. Another crucial element - the rulers' monopoly on legitimate violence - is disappearing. Europe and North America have seen a growth of 10 per cent per years in private security companies taking over the state prerogatives since the 1970s, a Peace Research Institute Frankfurt report shows. # Privatization of capital. Just like coercion, controlling capital is a crucial element in Tilly's hypothesis, as wars are expensive. However, national economics is a function of international economics and subject to international norms, rules, and regulations in the modern world. # Different interest groups. Tilly concludes that the civilianization of government evolved through the bargaining between rulers and their citizens. However, \\"the privatization of coercion and capital and the decentralization of political power has left rulers as brokers between different [...] interest groups rather than ruling them from a national center\\".  1992 Edition  A revised edition of the book was published in 1992 with the title Coercion, Capital, and European States AD 990-1992. For that edition, Tilly made minor revisions throughout the book and added an extra section discussing the rapid changes in Central and Eastern Europe after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

It is currently used in several different contexts by the University and can be seen on its own, on the University banner, as part of the heraldic achievement of the University, or featured in the logos of numerous University divisions, as well as the logo of the University as a whole. Despite its varied usage, modification of the coat of arms is extremely rare, as its use is strictly controlled by the University's Office of International, Governmental, and Institutional Relations. Several University divisions, notably the colleges, have their own emblems, and they do not regularly use the University coat of arms. The motto, which is not itself part of the arms but of the overall heraldic achievement, is velut arbor aevo, Latin for \\"may it grow as a tree through the ages\\". This phrase originates from Horace's Odes, book I, ode 12, line 45: crescit occulto velut arbor √¶vo fama Marcelli (\\"the fame of Marcellus grows like a tree over time unseen\\"). Blazon The blazon of the University coat of arms is as follows: The armorial bearings of the University are blazoned by the Canadian Heraldic Authority as follows: * Arms: Azure two open books above a beaver statant proper, on a chief Argent the Royal Crown proper * Crest: An oak tree Or leaved Vert fructed Or * Motto: VELUT ARBOR ”îVO (Latin for \\"As a tree, over time\\") History The origins of the coat of arms are obscure. The earliest reference to the device is an 1857 recommendation that the senate of the University adopt the coat of arms, which was accepted. From that point on, the general design has remained largely unchanged. There have been minor alterations, such as the loss of the original supporters (Minerva and Victoria) and the transformation of the beaver from an aggressive to a more benign charge over time. The latter was described by University graphic designer Caz Zyvatkauskas in 2000 as the \\"emasculation of the U of T beaver\\". In 1917, owing to a lack of uniformity among the coats of arms on campus due to decades of lax regulation, the board of governors petitioned the College of Arms to create an official description of the University coat of arms. The result was the current blazon, quoted in the preceding section. The arms of University College were completed at the same time. Both arms cost the University a combined ¬£89, six shillings. It was at this time that the crest of the University, which was originally a maple tree, became an oak tree. The armorial bearings of the University of Toronto were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on May 20, 2016. Associated emblems The University of Toronto contains many divisions, some of which use emblems distinct from those of the University. Some University divisions were founded as independent institutions and were later absorbed into the University. This, as well as the different aesthetics of those eras during which the emblems were designed, accounts for the difference in styles used by each institution.

The Muslim Walls of Madrid, also known as the Arab Walls of Madrid, of which some vestiges remain, are located in the Spanish city of Madrid. They are probably the oldest construction extant in the city. They were built in the 9th century, during the Muslim domination of the Iberian Peninsula, on a promontory next to Manzanares river. They were part of a fortress around which developed the urban nucleus of Madrid. They were declared an Artistic-Historic Monument in 1954. The remains of utmost importance, with more archaeological than artistic interest, are in the Cuesta de la Vega, next to the crypt of the Almudena Cathedral. They were built in the park of Mohamed I, named in reference to Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba, considered the founder of the city. Along the Calle Mayor street, at number 83, next to the Viaduct that serves the Calle de Segovia, are still standing the ruins of the , which probably would have been an albarrana tower, with a separate location from the main wall itself, but connected thereto by a minor wall. Its function was to serve as a viewpoint. In the 20th century, some remains were destroyed. The rest once existing near number 12 Calle de Bail√©n were lost with the construction of an apartment block, although some walls were integrated into the building structure as its foundation. The remodeling of the Plaza de Oriente, completed in 1996 during the mayoral term of Jos√© Mar√≠a √Ålvarez del Manzano, meant the discovery and subsequent disappearance of numerous remains. This was not the case with the watchtower known as , whose base is on display in the underground car park of the same plaza. Between 1999 and 2000, another section was uncovered, about long, under the Plaza de la Armer√≠a, formed by the main fa√ßades of the Royal Palace and Almudena Cathedral. It was excavated during the construction work of the Museum of Royal Collections (unfinished) and may correspond to the Puerta de la Sagra, one of the gates to the walled enclosure.  Historical Context = Walled enclosures in Al-Andalus = Detail drawing by Anton van den Wyngaerde in 1562, in which is seen the Muslim Walls of Madrid, from the disappeared Alc√°zar to the left, to the gate Puerta de la Vega, to the right. When studying Muslim urbanism it is necessary in the first instance to avoid a number of very typical platitudes on the subject. First, far from what is usually said when comparing Muslim with Christian cities, the first are not a cluster of buildings without any order. On the contrary, because, as Torres Balb√°s says, \\"Islamization was a uniform urban mold, the result of a way of life.\\" For example, the finding of winding streets corresponds to a context in which defense is a fundamental necessity. With respect to the Walls, they fulfill several functions. Muslim cities have as core a medina, which include, among other buildings, the main mosque and the hammam. It is surrounded by a wall, from which are deducted the defensive, symbolic and administrative functions of the walled enclosure. In Madrid, similarly, the Walls were built to protect the fundamental area of the city -not only from external danger, but also from potential internal revolts in the suburbs (also possibly walled). The differentiation of spaces produced by the Walls, thanks to the gates -three in this case- also aided the implementation of taxes. Thus, the city was divided between the medina or center of religious and commercial life, and the rabad, the \\"populous neighborhoods outside the walls\\". From a planning point of view, the Walls promoted urbanism through its gates and its path: its gates because through it would run the streets of greater affluence and its layout because the neighborhoods would range around it. In this section we could also talk about different possibilities when building Walls, from the materials used to various designs to suit the terrain. However, there are many other models that serve as examples. = Medieval Madrid = Drawing of the Royal Alc√°zar of Madrid of J. Cornelius Vermeyenen, made around 1534-1535. On the left side it can be observed that part of the Muslim Walls, in the 16th century, were in a visible state of deterioration. The construction of these Walls is directly linked to the origin of Madrid. They were ordered built by the C√≥rdoban emir Muhammad I (852 - 886) on an unspecified date between the years 860 and 880, according to a text of al- Himyari. It was in an area not chosen by chance. It was a wide cultivated valley, with easy access to water reserves. It defended the almudaina or Muslim citadel of Mayrit (first name of the city), located on the site currently occupied by the Royal Palace. According to Muslim chroniclers of the time, high quality construction and materials were used to build the Walls. The historian Jer√≥nimo de Quintana echoed these accounts in the following text of the 17th century: \\"very strong of masonry and mortar, raised and thick, twelve feet [almost three and half meters] in width, with large cubes, towers gatehouses and moats\\". The mission of the fortified complex was to monitor the path of the Manzanares, which connected the steppes of the Sierra de Guadarrama with Toledo, threatened by the incursions of the Christian kingdoms of the north peninsula. It was governed as a ribat or community, simultaneously both religious and military. The Walls of Mayrit were integrated within a complex defensive system, which extended through different parts of the Community of Madrid. These included Talamanca de Jarama, Qal'-at'-Abd-Al-Salam (Alcal√° de Henares) and Qal'-at-Jalifa (Villaviciosa de Od√≥n). However, do not think of Mayrit as a core of a large entity, but as one of many entities -so is it that sometimes is difficult to find references to the city in the chronicles-. In the 10th century, the caliph of C√≥rdoba Abd- ar-Rahman III ordered the reinforcement of the Walls, after suffering several situations of danger from the advance of the Christian King Ramiro II of Le√≥n in 932. In the year 977, Almanzor chose the fortress of Mayrit as the origin point of his military campaign. With the Christian conquest of Mayrit in the 9th century, the original walled area was expanded, raising one of wider perimeter, known as the Christian Walls of Madrid. Thus, the Madrilenian core did not lose its defensive function at any time. The image of the Virgin of Almudena, , formerly called , was found in 1085 (three centuries after the Christians hid it from Muslims) in the conquest of the city by King Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile, in one of the hubs of the Walls, near the gate Puerta de la Vega, and placed in the old mosque, for the worship and devotion of the Court and the people of Madrid.  Features = General Information = Another view of the remains in the park of Mohamed I The Muslim Walls of Madrid protected a fortified complex, in which there were three preeminent buildings: the alc√°zar, the mosque and the house of the emir or governor. The Walls started directly from the alc√°zar, from its southern part, with the other three sides of the building uncovered, because the rough terrain did not require a greater fortification there. To the west, the cliffs located on the plain of Manzanares river constituted a natural defense of the alc√°zar; a similar function was served by the ravines and gorges of the brook del Arenal, to the north and to the east. Their total length was about , enclosing an area of about . They had an outside moat only in their eastern section, where the ground had an elevation even higher than that of . Around the Walls there were several independent watchtowers, but we only have a historical record of the , named for its proximity to a cemetery. This was built in the 11th century, before the conquest of Madrid by the king Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile, and integrated into the Christian Walls as Albarrana tower. Outside the Walls, there were different public lands dedicated to leisure and equestrian games (almusara), plus a Muslim neighborhood or medina, and a Christian suburb or mozarabs. = Gates = Detail of the gate Puerta de la Vega, in the plan of Pedro Teixeira, of 1656 The Walls have three gates, of direct access and without any bend: * The , located in the current Cuesta de la Vega, connected the military compound with the plains of the Manzanares river and the roads of Castile and Extremadura. It might have been located on the site now occupied by the foreign niche of the Virgin of la Almudena, next to the crypt of the eponymous cathedral; * The or Arco de Santa Mar√≠a led to the civil core developed outside the fortress, through the current Calle Mayor; * The , or de la Xagra, or del Campo ended up in the gardens, by the current Calle de Bail√©n, in semicorner with Plaza de Oriente. From an archaeological perspective, the Puerta de la Vega offers the most data; thus existing references utilize data extrapolated from the excavations. The foundations of one of the buckets that originally flanked this gate have been documented. The dimensions of the access, according to data from the excavations, would have been . Typologically it is a narrow gate, between two towers and a poorly developed. After the archaeological activities only the foundation has been preserved, but this is outside of its original position. = Towers = The wall was organized in different towers, quadrangular, of between according to the tower- and with paw at the base, with an arrangement slightly protruding from the main wall. They were spaced approximately every . These stretches combined stonework of flint and limestone. Despite the measures, currently these are just highlights with respect to the wall in which they are framed. The section that must necessarily serve as a guide because of being the best preserved, that of Park Mohamed I, has about between each tower. There are a total of six, although one tower was lost, but is indicated by its base. The towers serve to confirm, once again, that this constitutes an enclosure of an Islamic court. The shape of the towers supports such a conclusion, as usually the Christians used a semicircular shape, clearly unlike those seen in the Park Mohamed I.  Visible fragments = Park of Mohamed I = Remains of the Muslim Walls of Madrid, in the Cuesta de la Vega, integrated within the Park of Mohamed I. This is the most important fragment, both in its state of preservation and in its accessibility to visitors. The excavations carried out there in 1972-1975 and 1985 onwards have been aided by the demolition of a 19th-century building that sat on the stretch itself, revealing a lot of data. This happened two years after 1985, and also represented a restoration and enhancement of the section of the wall. It has in view approximately . This part of the Walls has been preserved by being used as a load-bearing wall in buildings of modern times, and surfaced after their demolition. However, the fact that it has been used as a foundation should not be overlooked, because all the Walls might have also had such a fate. Apparently, many sections of the Walls were rebuilt and remodeled as well, and others may have suffered worse in the course of history. It is a stretch of a width around , which is quite consistent if put in relation to the size of the towers that are around it. There are two exterior walls that have inside masonry to mode of core. The masonry is linked with lime mortar. It is of note that all materials that make the stretch could be found relatively close to the city areas, which reaffirms once again the geostrategic role of the rise in which emerged the Islamic city. Deepening in the two facing walls, its bottoms are formed by large blocks of flint, cut only on its outer face and slightly trimmed, but not modeling, inside. From there rise ashlars of limestone, providing a new finding that the track is of al-Andalusian origin, because the materials follow the style of Cordoban rigging, which is a constant in the centuries in which life unfolds in Madrid. The C√≥rdoban rigging is an ashlar to rope ‚Äì the longest part of it abroad ‚Äì and two or three blight, the short side visible. This is difficult to appreciate along the stretch, because the passage of time. In fact, it is possible that the Walls was remodeled in the 10th century after a siege of Ramiro II of Le√≥n, but never possible that was rebuilt. Finding on foot of wall the C√≥rdoban rigging may be difficult, because when it put in value in the late 1980s was applied a render in white, if it was on track to hide some patches implanted in the wall during its time as load- bearing wall also hid some details. On the other hand, the small arch that can be seen capping could be a sort of drain without interest, which follows the documentation of modern times, which marks the passage of a small stream by that area. To try to provide a more historical perspective was recreated a small slope to try to rebuild the period atmosphere, as transformed by the growth of Madrid. = Calle Bail√©n 12 = The calle Bail√©n n.¬∫ 12 is a building founded on remnants of the Walls. This was built in 1970s, and though by then it already was an Artistic Historical Monument, two sections of the Walls and a tower were destroyed -one to make site to the building, and other to give way to its tenants-. The building, however, retains some vestiges of the stretch in a very bad state, because at present are part of their private garage. These are remains very similar to those of Park of Muhamed I, because it is an extension of the same. The incomprehensible destruction was accompanied by some documentation work, and today is known to have a width of 2.5 meters -a little narrower than the portion that has already been seen- and offered a possibility that can not usually be: the dissection of the wall. The data regarding the core of lime mortar masonry are given by this construction. Construction of Royal Collections Museum (2008), where remains of the Muslim Wall were found = Future Museum of Royal Collections = There is another large section of the Arab walls found in the late-1990s, directly opposite the Almudena Cathedral. These remains have surfaced as part of the works of the future Royal Collections Museum. As an area in which it is impossible to make any kind of archaeological tasting, the specialist Alain Kermovan traced the route through radioelectric detectors, without lifting the pavement. Are two stretches from the Islamic period, which between them account for about 70 meters. The materials used are the same, and construction techniques, but not the thickness: this exceeds, on average, the 3.2 meters, being slightly wider than previously seen. Here it has been able to verify the height, ranging around 7 meters, although this is found only in a section, because the other is destroyed completely.  Archaeological excavations  Until 1985, the archaeological excavations in the city of Madrid only had by protagonists visible elements such as fortified enclosures or churches. That, for the study of the Muslim Walls, is that since the first excavations of the late 18th century and the beginning of 19th century have been carrying out archaeological works. In the 20th century, there are some advances over the wall. The Instituto Arqueol√≥gico de Madrid, in the sixties and seventies, performs some tasks aimed at protecting the first and second enclosure, since both had been declared \\"monuments\\" in the fifties. Thus, were carried out archaeological campaigns in some areas as the Cuesta de la Vega -between 1972 and 1975- or the Calle Mayor. The lack of visible remains playing against the excavations in finding activities related to the Muslim walled. Since 1985 it has been excavated on the Cuesta de la Vega, placing on value the most important section of this enclosure setting the park called Muhamed I, in honor of the founder of the city.

It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2005-06. , Coimbatore has more than 700 wet grinder manufacturers with a monthly output 75,000 units per every 100,000 produced in India. Wet Grinder A wet grinder is a food preparation appliance used for grinding food grains to produce batter. Batter is used extensively in South Indian cuisine for preparation of popular dishes such as dosa, idly, vada, appam and paniyaram. It consists of granite stones which rotate inside a metal drum with the help of an electric motor and the food grains get crushed between the stone and drum. History P. Sabapathy developed the wet grinder in Coimbatore in 1955. Sabapathy introduced the grinders to other cities such as Chennai and Madurai. In 1963, P. B. Krishnamurthy started Lakshmi Grinders which led to the commercial popularity of wet grinders. In 1975, R. Doraiswamy invented the tilting wet grinders. L. G. Varadaraj introduced the table top wet grinders which replaced grinders which had to be placed on the ground. Industry Earlier wet grinders As the product was invented in the city, Coimbatore naturally emerged as a center for the manufacture of wet grinders. The availability of raw material in the form of granite stones, electric motor manufacturing units and the necessary heavy equipment such as lathes, drilling and milling machines used in manufacturing aided the development of the industry. The city contributes to about 75% of the 1 lakh total monthly output of wet grinders in India. The industry employs 20,000 people directly and provides indirect employment to 50,000. In 2011, the cluster had a yearly turnover of which grew to in 2015.

In 2019, Fernando stood down as CEO of Dilmah, as his son, Dilhan, was appointed the new head of the company. Early life Fernando was born in Pallansena, Negombo, British Ceylon in 1930. Fernando attended Maris Stella College in Negombo and Saint Joseph's College, Colombo in his youth. His first job was as a inspector for a U.S. petroleum company. Career Fernando was one of the first Sri Lankan tea tasters to be selected to learn about tea in Mincing Lane, London. Up until this time, the prevailing colonial system did not believe Sri Lankans were capable of assessing tea as they felt they ate too much curry which would affect their assessment of the taste. However, Fernando was one of five who were selected and trained in London.http://www.asianenterprise.biz/merrill-fernando-beyond-the-tea- garden/full.html It was in London that Fernando witnessed a system of colonial exploitation that treated tea producing countries as raw material suppliers whereas branding and value addition were done overseas and all profits accrued never reached the producers.http://fridaymagazine.ae/features/people/friday- talks-to-dilmah-s-founder-merrill-fernando-1.1978304 This greatly disturbed Fernando, who dreamed that someday he would create his own brand of tea where the producing country would receive all profits from value addition and thereby get their due recognition. He wanted to bring integrity back into tea.http://gulfbusiness.com/pictures-new-luxury-tea-lounge-opens-in- dubai/http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/pages/profile- detail.aspx?profile=mfernando With this intention he became, quite literally, the ‚Äúface‚Äù of his brand, his smiling persona emblazoned on tea packets around the world as he urged people: ‚ÄúDo try it.‚Äù He wanted to bring quality, authenticity and ethics back to tea. Fresh tea is rich in antioxidants and so he wanted to offer his consumers tea that was garden fresh handpicked and packed at its origin. Fernando strongly believed that consumers had the right to know exactly what they were drinking and so he pioneered the concept of single origin tea.http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/Sri%20Lanka/Case%20study%201.pdf Charity work Fernando believes in the philosophy of seeing business as a matter of human service. 10% of all Dilmah profits are channelled to the MJF Charitable Foundation http://www.mjffoundation.org which is working towards the dignified empowerment of underprivileged people around Sri Lanka.http://www.dilmahtea.com/tea-inspired- ebooks/free/business_is_matter_of_human_service/index.html Each year, the foundation cares for over 5,000 children in its Child Development Centres, nurtures over 1000 children through the MJF Kids, empowers women, and has created over 600 entrepreneurs through the Small Entrepreneur Programme ‚Äì SEP‚Äì and uplifted the lives of countless plantation workers.

Retrieved: January 24, 2016. The film was directed by Raymond Spottisswoode‚Äîfather of filmmaker Roger Spottiswoode‚Äîand produced by Stuart Legg and narrated by Lorne Greene.Lerner 1997, p. 1570.  Synopsis  Commercial air transportation in Canada began with bush pilots pioneering air routes in the north and Arctic. A new industry was born and within a few years, the air carriers serving the Canadian north became the largest carriers of airborne cargo in the world. Small bush companies eventually grew into modern airlines, the largest becoming the Trans-Canada Air Lines, offering transcontinental service. Airlines like Trans-Canada Air Lines operate with the complexity and precision of a well-run machine, relying of the work and effort of every employee, from technicians and mechanics on the ground, the operators at the weather station to the pilot at the controls; each individual plays an important role. With the coming of the Second World War, the airlines in Canada took on a new role. The strategic use of air transportation in Canada during wartime in connecting the far-flung industries and military stations, is significant. They are the link between the continents flying the great ocean clipper routes across the Atlantic and the Pacific. Canada's air services also serve to unite the battle front in Europe and the battle front in the Pacific. Planning for a postwar world, Canada's airlines are well fitted to take advantage of the wartime supply routes that were established across the globe. Production Wings of a Continent was part of the Canada Carries On series, produced with financial backing from the Wartime Information Board, and was released shortly after the United States went to war. The documentary was created as a morale boosting propaganda film during the Second World War.Morris, Peter. \\"Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On.\\" Canadian Film Encyclopedia. Retrieved: January 24, 2016. The narrator of Wings of a Continent was Lorne Greene, known for his work on both radio broadcasts as a news announcer at CBC as well as narrating many of the Canada Carries On series.Bennett 2004, p. 254. His sonorous recitation led to his nickname, \\"The Voice of Canada\\", and to some observers, the \\"voice-of- God\\".Rist 2001, p. 84. When reading grim battle statistics or as in Wings of a Continent, narrating a particularly serious topic such as Canada going to war, he was \\"The Voice of Doom\\".\\"Bonanza's Canadian Lorne Greene.\\" Bite Size Canada.

Reception As part of the Canada Carries On series, Wings of a Continent was produced in 35 mm for the theatrical market and also released as Les Ailes d'un Continent, a version dubbed in French. Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. When shown in Ottawa, the reviewer commented that, \\"The strategic significance of air transportation in Canada in a world now totally at war is graphically described in the December release of the National Film Board's 'Wings of a Continent'.\\"\\"Wings of a Continent is Film Board's latest.\\" Ottawa Citizen, December 17, 1941, p. 24. Along with others in the Canada Carries On series, Wings of a Continent received widespread circulation.Rist 2001, p. 124. The NFB had an arrangement with Famous Players theatres to ensure that Canadians from coast-to-coast could see the documentary series, with further distribution by Columbia Pictures.Ellis and McLane 2005, p. 122. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two.

With the fanbase described by some people as an ironic liking towards the series, there have been several sexually explicit memes based on the title character. The most notable example is a 2013 metameme centered on a video called \\"Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life,\\" which is based on a post originating on 4chan's /b/ board. Fans of Shrek are known as \\"Brogres\\", a take on the name \\"Bronies\\", the teen and adult fans of the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. A \\"Shrek Filmmaker\\" movement of Source Filmmaker animators making videos based on the Internet's obsession towards the character has also occurred. According to New York, Shrek is \\"one of the patron saints of the elaborate and complex culture of Dank Memedom.\\" 2001-2012: Background and early history The 2001 film Shrek, based on William Steig's picture book of the same name, garnered acclaim from critics and won an Oscar, while Shrek 2 (2004) was, at the time, the highest-grossing animated film ever at the North American box office. However, Dave Sims of The Atlantic's The Wire marked the second film as the start of the decline in quality and commercial success of the franchise, writing that none of the sequels was remembered due to the jokes' relying on \\"cheap topical gags and flimsy celebrity cameos.\\" He noted that \\"the joke of Shrek's mediocrity was then filtered through the Internet's many weird joke filters, which end up in a weird mix of sincerity and surrealism.\\" While fans had been creating and posting their own comics and pictures of Shrek depicted outside of the films on DeviantArt ever since Shrek's 2001 release, \\"it took about 11 years for the Internet's Shrek obsession to go from cute to cult-like\\" as The Daily Dot wrote. Shrek's official Facebook page was launched by DreamWorks on December 1, 2009, and was used to promote the products and spin-offs of the franchise, with the title character \\"speaking\\" to his fans through posts. These posts were very popular, garnering 1,000 to 2,000 more views than the typical promotional post at the time. In 2010, the year of the release of Shrek Forever After, a comic on DeviantArt titled \\"Shadow begs Shrek‚Äù was posted by user \\"cmara\\", and paired Shrek with Shadow the Hedgehog, a character from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. A Kotaku writer stated that a possible reason for the pairing was that both characters \\"tried to act like they were too cool for 'kid stuff.' Too sophisticated, too edgy. They were made for each other‚Äîand approximately one billion people between the ages of 12 and 34.\\"Grayson, Nathan (August 8, 2016). \\"The Internet's Shrek Obsession, Explained\\". Kotaku. Retrieved November 12, 2016. It went viral, and what followed was several memes, including what The Week journalist Scott Meslow described as \\"awful puns, half-assed Photoshops, bizarre fan fiction,\\" most of them sexually explicit, and a horror game revolving around Shrek stalking the player through a swamp. There have been lists compiling online Shrek fan art, including a January 2014 list by Chloe Cole of the CollegeHumor site Dorkly of \\"The Most Upsetting Shrek and Shadow Fan Art On the Internet\\", and official Smosh website writer Daniel Dominguez's list of \\"20 Uncomfortably Sexual Pieces Of Shrek Fan Art\\", published in November 2013. 2012-present: ShrekChan, Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life May 2012 marked the launch of ShrekChan, a 4chan-esque imageboard for fans of Shrek to satirically and occasionally seriously comment on anything related to the Shrek series. Fans of Shrek are nicknamed \\"brogres\\", which is a take on the name of the young adult fans of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic known as bronies. The board had garnered 500,000 visitors as of March 22, 2014. In 2013, Shrek's online popularity went to what The Daily Dot described as a \\"whole new demented level\\" with a fanmade video called Shrek Is Love, Shrek Is Life, an adaptation of a story posted on 4chan describing a sexual encounter between a nine-year-old boy and Shrek after the boy's father reprimands him for his Shrek obsession. A metameme based on this was posted on 4chan's paranormal board on January 31, 2013, which led to many \\"deranged illustrations\\" posted online influenced by the post. Many duplications of the video were also uploaded, with the video and its replicas garnering over 90 million views as of May 2016. On March 25, 2014, the video was a \\"Cartoon Brew pick\\", and the award was number 13 on their \\"Top 20 Stories of 2014\\" published on the site. The video was also put by Gizmodo writer Ashley Feinberg's list of the \\"11 of the Weirdest Videos on YouTube\\". In 2014, ShrekChan was shut down with a message from the board's founder: > The Shrek meme is dead, and it's time to stop trying to keep this going. It > is inevitable and it has to happen at some point in time. Many of you who > truly love the Shrek movies may think that shutting down ShrekChan is a bad > idea, but I hope that you may find another website to discuss the love for > Shrek. A \\"Shrek Filmmaker\\" movement in which Source Filmmaker animators made videos based on the Internet's obsession with Shrek was described by a PC Magazine journalist as \\"One of the craziest and funniest underground Source Filmmaker movements\\". The videos involve the character placed in \\"glitchy worlds of horrifying imagery and Smash Mouth references.\\" These videos have included parodies such as \\"Shrek It Ralph\\" and \\"Shreking Ball\\", as well as the crossover with R. L. Stine's series of novels Goosebumps \\"Shrek Gets Spooked\\", which had close to two million views by October 2015. In November 2018, comedy group 3GI, organizer of Shrekfest, released a shot-for-shot parody remake of the film Shrek made by a crew of over 200 artists, titled Shrek Retold. A sequel to this remake called Shrek 2 Retold is currently in the works. Its first trailer was shown on Shrekfest 2019. Analysis and reception Purposely-bad fan art and animation of Shrek and loyalty towards the song \\"All Star\\" by pop rock group Smash Mouth, which played in the first film of the series, are also considered traits of the Internet's obsession towards Shrek. Sims wrote that one possible reason of Shrek's Internet fanbase was that the franchise was a depiction of \\"everything that was initially exciting and then quickly patronizing\\" about the early 2000s, saying that \\"It's symbolic of so many things we briefly loved before quickly realizing their emptiness.\\" He also said that with many other memes, Occam's razor is a factor: \\"Shrek has a funny, stupid face, and putting that face in a weird place provokes a cheap laugh.\\" The online appreciation of Shrek has also been described as ironic. Know Your Meme's former researcher Amanda Brennan described it as a \\"subversion of brony culture, again taking something relatively childish with good intentions and flipping it to an ironic appreciation.\\" Sims shared a similar sentiment by noting that, like other memes, it was \\"one giant agreed- upon joke. No one ever admits that the Shrek series is a cinematic masterpiece, even though DreamWorks drove it into the ground as hard as it possibly could.\\" Alan Hanson, a contributor for The Awl who made fun of ShrekChan and similar fansites, found the darker side of the Internet's obsession towards Shrek: > A lot of Shrek content is him making awful faces, being very leery. > Children's movies and fairytales are already inherently very dark, and Shrek > on its own tries to show the even darker side of that, so it's almost the > natural progression to get into the real \\"swamp\\" of Shrek, the \\"Drek\\" as > they say. If Shrek is love, Drek is everything that's not Shrek/love. He described a fan's apartment as a \\"swamp,\\" which \\"is lovely because it's your place, made of the things that comfort you, even if they're gross and unliked by others.\\" He said that a person who is against loving Shrek can be called a \\"Farquaad.

Wet grinders are used to make pastes from grains and lentils and is used extensively in South Indian cuisine for preparation of popular dishes such as dosa, idly, vada, appam and paniyaram. It consists of a granite stones which rotate inside a metal drum with the help of an electric motor and the food grains get crushed between the stone and drum. History P. Sabapathy developed the wet grinder in Coimbatore in 1955. Sabapathy introduced the grinders to other cities such as Chennai and Madurai. In 1963, P. B. Krishnamurthy started Lakshmi Grinders which led to the commercial popularity of wet grinders. In 1975, R. Doraiswamy invented the tilting wet grinders. L. G. Varadaraj introduced the table top wet grinders which replaced grinders which had to be placed on the ground. Manufacturing Wet grinder consists of granite stones which rotate inside a metal drum with the help of an electric motor and the food grains get crushed between the stone and drum. Wet grinders have two advantages over electric mixers or blenders. First, the stone grinder generates less heat than a mixer and heat affects the flavor of the food. Second, the stones remain sharp for a greater time than do metal blades. Industry As the product was invented in the city, Coimbatore naturally emerged as a center for the manufacture of wet grinders. The availability of raw material in the form of granite stones, electric motor manufacturing units and the necessary heavy equipment such as lathes, drilling and milling machines used in manufacturing aided the development of the industry. The city contributes to about 75% of the 1 lakh total monthly output of wet grinders in India. The industry employs 20,000 people directly and provides indirect employment to 50,000. In 2011, the cluster had a yearly turnover of which grew to in 2015. Geographical Indication In 2005, the Government of Tamil Nadu applied for Geographical Indication for Coimbatore wet grinder. The Government of India recognized it as a Geographical indication officially since the year 2005-06.

Background  Annie Steckler was born in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents were Ukrainian immigrants; her father's name was Philip Steckler, born in (1875‚Äì1925) in Romny, Ukraine. She had two sisters, Frieda and Sylvia. Annie Stein was no outsider to the hardships faced by the racially and economically oppressed. Stein grew up in the midst of poverty, witnessing first hand her own parents' struggle to feed and support her. She earned a scholarship to Hunter College. In the mid 1930s, while attending Hunter, Stein left her studies for Washington to defend the Scottsboro Boys, nine African-American boys falsely accused of raping two white women.\\"Annie Stein Papers.\\" Columbia University Libraries: Archival Collections: http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead/nnc- rb/ldpd_6909494/summary Web. 19 Jan. 2016. The protest became the first in a long career of activism that made Stein a noteworthy historical figure. After finishing her studies, Stein returned to Washington and dedicate her life's work to fighting the injustices perpetuated by discrimination in employment, public spaces and schools.  Career  Stein's work in Washington, D.C. began with a governmental position at the Works Progress Administration. In the late 1930s, deciding that activism was more important, Stein left her career at the Administration to become the chair of the Women's Trade Union League. As chair, Stein devoted her time to labor organizing and protest. After the United States joined World War II, Stein joined the Congress of Industrial Organizations at the Office of Price Administration to fight war time inflation. Her committee monitored grocery store and restaurant owners to make sure that they observed ceiling prices. In a culminating effort against inflation, Stein joined the Washington Committee for Consumer Protection (WCCP) and organized a citywide strike against the rising wartime prices of food and service.\\"Perlstein, Daniel H. Justice, Justice: School Politics and the Eclipse of Liberalism. New York: P. Lang, 2004.\\" During her protests with the WCCP, Stein used progressive tactics such as boycotting and picketing in front of the stores that increased their price on meat and milk. Stein's picket signs featured the slogan: \\"Don‚Äôt buy meat over six cents a pound\\". Receiving over 40,000 signatures, Stein submitted a petition to legislators that stabilized the price of milk and meat for a few weeks. Stein's career reached a major milestone when she met Mary Church Terrell in the battle against anti-discrimination in the nation's capital.Protests at Thompson's Restaurant with Mary Terrell as one of the ringleaders In the mid-1940s, Stein and Terrell were both actively fighting the continued segregation in the District's restaurants, theaters, and shopping centers. Together they created the Coordinating Committee for the Enforcement of the D.C Anti-Discrimination Laws to formally address racial discrimination. In the Coordinating Committee, Stein served as secretary to Terrell who considered her, \\"the greatest secretary in the world\\". The Coordinating Committee used the claims made by the D.C. Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild about the \\"lost laws\\" of 1872, to fuel their direct action protests against segregation.From the description of Coordinating Committee for the Enforcement of the D.C. Anti-Discrimination Laws records, 1949‚Äì1954. (Historical Society of Washington, D.C.). WorldCat record id: 70969702: http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6rp19gx The \\"lost laws\\" effectively eliminated segregation in the city, but had been dropped from the District code. The Guild argued that laws were still valid. = District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co. case = One of Stein's most influential protests with the Coordinating Committee occurred on January 27, 1950. The committee sent an interracial party to Thompson's restaurant to seek service. The owner rejected the party, stating: \\"We don‚Äôt serve colored\\" according to witness Marvin Caplan, the chairman of the Coordinating Committee's Publicity Committee. The Coordinating Committee sought support from the D.C. corporation counsel to uphold the \\"lost laws\\" arguing that Thompson's had violated the District of Columbia's Criminal Code by refusing to serve an interracial party.Annie Stein Papers; Box and Folder; Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University Library. According to the \\"lost laws\\", a business should serve \\"any respectable, well-behaved person without regard to race, color or previous condition of servitude\\".\\"Constitutional Amendments and Major Civil Rights Acts of Congress Referenced in Black Americans in Congress  US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives.\\" Constitutional Amendments and Major Civil Rights Acts of Congress. Accessed January 22, 2016. The Coordinating Committee pursued legal action in the case of District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co., validate the \\"lost laws\\", but for more than two years, the courts refused to hear the case. The case was finally successfully reintroduced in 1953 with the support of President Dwight Eisenhower, a strong civil rights activist, and on June 8, 1953 the court unanimously made the anti-discrimination laws valid. These anti-discrimination laws, now known as the Civil Rights Act, formally put a legal end to discrimination in Washington, a major victory for the committee. = Trailway Bus Line's fountain counter incident = Stein was not always successful. The Trailway Bus Line's fountain counter incident demonstrated one of Stein's protests that did not result in a positive racial change. The management of a six-stooled bus station bus fountain counter refused to serve blacks, prompting demands from the Coordination Committee to integrate the counter. The committee cited the now enforceable \\"lost laws\\" in their case. Grudgingly the fountain counter managers began accepting black customers, however in response, the stools were removed so that \\"white and black alike stand up for their cokes.\\" Stein relates the ironic way in which \\"democracy was achieved\\" in a critique appearing in the Washington Post: \\"It seems to me that this incident is symbolic of the deprivations we whites endure to nourish our ugly prejudices.\\" The fountain counter exemplifies the difficulties that Stein faced. Despite leading a strong legal and social fight for equality, her work was often hindered by stubborn social conventions on race. After leading a successful activist career in Washington for more than a decade, Stein returned to New York in the mid-1950s to reunite with family. In New York Stein continued her commitment to activism and protest for social justice. = Career in New York = After her triumph in legalizing the anti-discrimination laws with the Coordinating Committee, Stein veered her political activism towards schooling. In 1953, Stein moved to Brooklyn, New York and joined the Parents Teacher Association(PTA) where she fought for the inequality of schooling. Stein tried all political avenues to secure a better education for the inner city's predominantly black and Puerto Rican, low-income children. She encouraged the councilmen to allow open enrolment in schools and mass transfers, considering that any change would elevate the quality of education for poor children. In 1964 Stein launched her biggest assault against the unyielding school system. Joining the community together, she called for a one-day boycott on the school system, and on Freedom Day, February 3, 1964 half a million children skipped school. Although the boycott was more of a symbolic success then a policy changing one, the majority support that Stein achieved demonstrated the inner city community's firm intentions on achieving educational equality. Stein's efforts in pushing for integration and equality was opposed by conservative whites who refused to put their children in integrated schools and school boards that remained indifferent in raising the quality education for blacks and Hispanics. Stein firmly believed that racism in schools reflected the larger failings of society stating: > If racism in the society at large becomes reflected in school policies\\", she > said in one report, \\"remedy must be sought through continuing and extending > the battle against racism in society as a whole and by protecting the child > from this racism. School policies and attitudes cannot be permitted to > continue to reflect society's racism.\\"Perlstein, Daniel H. Justice, Justice: > School Politics and the Eclipse of Liberalism. New York: P. Lang, 2004. Stein continued to be an advocate for the disadvantaged until her death. In the 1970s Stein won a slot as the legislative aide to the Rev. Milton A. Galamison, vice chairman of the New York City Board of Education. She used this position to continue her goal of decentralizing the city's school systems and advocating citywide school integration. Personal life and death On August 12, 1933, Annie Steckler married Arthur Stein (activist). In 1942, they had a son, Philip Steckler Stein, and daughter, Eleanor Raskin. Annie Stein died age 68 on May 13, 1981, from cancer.  Legacy and ideology  Stein's strategy was :\\"Negotiate, boycott, picket\\", she claimed that this three-part strategy worked to raise awareness about discriminatory institutions, and apply social pressure to effect policy change. Her work with revolutionary and forward thinking activists Mary Church Terrell and Ella Baker, who further developed her philosophy on social justice. Stein embraced radical politics and communism throughout her political career. In her activism for racial and gender equality, she believed that \\"If fighting for lower tuition fees, for the rights of the Negro, for higher wages for student workers, for lower prices for the lunch room --- if that be a Red then let's be Reds\\". Her communist politics haunted her for the rest of her career especially during the Cold War under McCarthyism. Stein's husband Alfred Stein was also an active member of the communist party and refused to collaborate with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Stein's daughter Eleanor upheld her mother's tradition of resistance in the 1960s leading the Weather Underground, a radical Anti-Vietnam War movement.

On 13 June 2012, Gerard was charged with murder and interfering with a corpse. On 15 July 2014, he was found guilty of murder (the other charge was dropped) and given a life sentence. Gerard appealed the conviction and, on 8 December 2015, these charges were downgraded to manslaughter. In August 2016, the High Court of Australia re-instated the murder conviction. Background On 23 August 1997, Allison Dickie had married Gerard Robert Baden-Clay, who had been born in Bournemouth, England, United Kingdom on 9 September 1970. In 1971, Gerard's family had migrated from Zambia to Rhodesia, where they changed their family name to \\"Baden-Clay\\" to associate the family with his father's grandfather, Lord Baden-Powell of Scouting fame. In 1980, the Baden-Clay family migrated to Australia. After leaving school, Gerard trained in accountancy, and then worked for Flight Centre in Brisbane, where Allison was a colleague. At the time of Allison's death in 2012, the couple were on diverging financial paths. Allison had become an executive for Flight Centre, but Gerard, who had been running a successful up-market real estate franchise since 2004, was struggling following the disastrous Brisbane floods. The couple lived in a rented house in Brookfield, Queensland along with their three daughters aged 10 and under. In October 2011, Allison learnt of a long-standing affair her husband was having with an employee at his business. At the time of her disappearance Allison's life was insured for more than A$800,000. Disappearance and discovery At 7:15 am on Friday, 20 April 2012, p. 4. Gerard reported Allison missing. He claimed she sometimes went for a walk at 5am and assumed she had done so that morning. She was always back in time for their daughters' breakfast, and he became concerned when she had not returned home. On 30 April, a woman's body was found by a canoeist at Kholo Creek, Anstead, about from the Baden-Clay home in Brookfield. The following day, the body was confirmed to be Allison. Her funeral was held in Ipswich on 11 May. The autopsy report stated that the cause of death could not be determined. Trial and conviction On 13 June 2012, Gerard was formally interviewed at Indooroopilly police station and charged with Allison's murder and for interfering with her corpse. He maintained his innocence and said he would \\"be strenuously defending the charges\\". Gerard's bail application was denied on 22 June because Justice David Boddice said he posed a \\"significant flight risk\\". The trial began in the Brisbane Supreme Court on 10 June 2014. Gerard pleaded not guilty to the charges. On 15 July, he was found guilty of murdering Allison. He was given a life sentence with a non-parole period of fifteen years. The charge of interfering with a corpse was dropped. Defence appeal On 7 August 2015, Gerard appealed his conviction to the Queensland Court of Appeal. On 8 December, his conviction was downgraded to manslaughter,R v Baden-Clay . on the ground that the evidence at trial was not able to exclude a reasonable hypothesis that ‚Äúthere was a physical confrontation between [Baden-Clay] and his wife in which he delivered a blow which killed her (for example, by the effects of a fall hitting her head against a hard surface) without intending to cause serious harm\\". Prosecution appeal The decision of the Court of Appeal was controversial. There was a strong public reaction and a large rally was organised calling for an appeal to the High Court of Australia. On 18 December, a crowd estimated at around 4,000 people gathered in King George Square in the centre of Brisbane to support the proposal that the decision be appealed. p. 457. Some members of the legal profession, in turn, were vocal in defending the decision handed down by the Court of Appeal. Prominent Queensland lawyer Terry O'Gorman, for example, said that, \\"You don't have a murder case or any other case decided by who can yell out loudest in the media\\" and that \\"those who don't like it have to cop it because that is the law.\\"Murray, op.cit., p.455. However, in an unusual move, the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions decided to appeal against the downgrade. The following year, on 31 August 2016, more than four years after Allison had died, the High Court of Australia restored the original trial murder conviction. The Queen v Baden-Clay . Later developments In February 2017, Allison's father was appointed the executor of her estate. It was ruled that Gerard Baden-Clay was not entitled to any benefits from her death. Legacy The Allison Baden-Clay Foundation was launched on 31 July 2015. Its aim is to \\"create a Queensland community that acknowledges the prevalence of domestic and family violence\\". In March 2018, the first annual scholarship in Allison's memory for an aspiring ballet dancer was announced by the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, who had known Allison as a child.Gerard Baden-Clay murder conviction reinstated by High Court ABC News, 31 Aug 2016 See also *Death of Maria Korp *List of solved missing persons cases ReferencesFurther reading * * External links * The Allison Baden-Clay Foundation Death of Allison Baden-Clay Category:2010s murders in Australia Death of Allison Baden-Clay Category:2012 murders in Oceania Category:Death in Queensland Category:Deaths by person in Australia Category:Manslaughter in Australia Category:Missing person cases in Australia Category:Uxoricides ","title":"Murder of Allison Baden-Clay"},{"id":"49214383","text":"Billa Billa is a rural locality in the Goondiwindi Region, Queensland, Australia.

Built in 1845 as the house for the manager of a copper mine on the island, it was extended significantly by Grey during his ownership. Mansion House is a heritage listed building. It is open to the public as part of the Kawau Island Historic Reserve administered by the Department of Conservation. Background Kawau Island is in the Hauraki Gulf, about from Auckland. It was occupied by MƒÅori up until sometime in the 19th century and in 1839 was purchased by a land company intending to avail itself of the island's timber. In 1844, copper deposits were discovered and mining infrastructure was quickly established. However, the efforts to extract the copper was plagued with flooding of mine shafts and workers left to go gold mining in Australia. The copper mine on Kawau Island closed in 1855, after around had been extracted. The island was put up for sale in 1862 at which time Sir George Grey, newly commencing a second term as Governor of New Zealand, purchased it for ¬£3,500. Mansion House In 1845, the manager of the mine, Captain James Ninnis, had a two level brick dwelling of 11 rooms built at Momona Bay (what is now called Mansion House Bay). When Grey purchased the island, he was impressed with the building, commenting favourably on its thick walls, kauri timber and surrounding landscape. He contracted the architect Frederick Thatcher to extend the house with additional bedrooms, as well as dining and drawing rooms. Thatcher maintained the original Georgian style of the house, designing a new wing with an elongate verandah and bay window. The work was completed by an Auckland builder for ¬£5,000. Grey lived in the house from 1870 to 1874 and then used it as a getaway. For much of this time, his niece also resided at Mansion House. He spent extravagantly on the property, filling the house with artifacts from around the world and importing rare plant and animal species for his gardens. In 1888, his health now in decline, Grey sold the island. The new owners added the distinctive verandahs, designed by the architect Robert Watt, to the front face of the house and by 1901, it had become known as Mansion House. Over the next several decades, much of the surrounding land was subdivided and the house itself had several owners. The island was a popular destination for tourists and day trippers from Auckland and for much of this time, Mansion House was operated as a hotel. Grey and his niece in one of the rooms of Mansion House, around 1870‚Äì71 In 1967, the last owner sold the house and surrounding land to the New Zealand Government so that it may be included in the newly established Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park. Mansion House continued to be operated as a hotel under a lease and was subject to some alterations that was not in keeping with the character of the building. In 1977, the lease was surrendered and the house underwent extensive renovations to bring it back to how it appeared in the 1890s. Furnished and decorated with loaned or donated period pieces, Mansion House was opened to the public in October 1979. Mansion House was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now called Heritage New Zealand) on 23 June 1983 and has registration number 8. The building has a category I listing. It is administered by the Department of Conservation as part of the Kawau Island Historic Reserve.

In early life he was in business with his father, a wholesale flour-merchant in Philadelphia, for several years, after which he entered Yale College, in 1837. On graduation in 1840 he became a tutor in Western Reserve College, at Hudson, Ohio ; and during the two years which he spent there he was also occupied in the study of divinity under the Rev. Dr. L. P. Hickok, the Professor of Theology. In 1842 he was ordained by the Lutheran Synod at Rhinebeck, New York, and was settled over a church in Valatie, Columbia County. In 1843, however, he removed to the Lutheran Church in Winchester, Va., and after five years' service there he resigned in 1848 to become Professor of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology in the Auburn Theological Seminary. He left Auburn in 1851 for Newark, New Jersey, where he was installed in December as pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church. In this office he remained until his sudden death from apoplexy, at Newark, on June 22, 1888, in his 73rd year. As one of the founders of the German Theological School in New Jersey, as President of the Board of Church Erection for many years, as a Director of the Union Theological Seminary from 1852, and as a member of various important committees of the Presbyterian General Assembly, Dr. FewSmith had wide ecclesiastical influence ; while his eminent usefulness as a pastor was evidenced by the high esteem in which he was held in Newark.

Existing prints of the cartoon are likely to have missing footage and some distorted sequences. Plot One night, a trio of criminal gorillas go on a rampage in a city using a machine gun. They even looted some shops. As they flee in their van, they are being followed by Krazy who is on a bike. They try to stop the cat from pursuing them by firing their machine gun. Krazy, however, is able to keep the bullets at bay. The gorillas manage to lose Krazy somehow before they reach their hideout which is secretly under a cemetery. Strangely, one of the inhabitants in the hideout is a canine girl who strongly resembles Krazy's spaniel girlfriend. The leader gorilla treats her by offering a diamond necklace which the canine girl dons and embraces. Krazy arrives at the cemetery minutes later but has lost track of the gorillas. After evading things like moving tombstones, Krazy encounters a living skeleton who shows him a passageway to the hideout for some reason. Krazy walks inside the hideout to where the leader gorilla and the canine girl are at a table. While the canine girl gives Krazy a warm greeting, the leader gorilla isn't happy to see him. Krazy confronts the simian boss with a pistol but the latter answers by showing multiple guns. The other two gorillas come and take the cat away. The two gorillas take Krazy with them in the van. After traveling a few miles, they stop. When they step out, one of the gorillas draws an x on the ground, and tells Krazy to stand on it where they will shoot him. But before a bullet could be fired, Krazy shows them a photograph of his grandmother who cherishes him and would miss him if he perishes now. The gorillas tearfully feel sorry and decide not to kill him.

Background Sleep ‚àû Over formed in 2009 as a trio of musicians Stefanie Franciotti, Sarah Brown and Christa Palazzolo. They produced and released various singles on the labels Light Lodge and Forest Family before Brown and Palazzolo left the project to form the group Boy Friend. Thus, Franciotti was left on her own to create Sleep ‚àû Over's debut studio album. Composition Critic Guy Frowny suggests Forever is an \\"unfolding\\" of a \\"dark baby land,\\" \\"a realm somewhere between heavens ‚Äúturning by themselves,‚Äù populated by flying saucers, and the lifeworld-bound closed doors and tears that can reference either romance or depravity;\\" the unfolding is done by the vocals of Franciotti, symbolized as a spiritual guide. Forever is an ambient electropop record that is \\"downcast, introspective, and melodic,\\" wrote Patrick McDermott of The Boston Phoenix. In comparing Forever to the works of Peaking Lights and Sun Araw, reviewer Zach Kelly categorized it as a shoegaze record with a more \\"dynamic\\" and less \\"aimless\\" and \\"soupy\\" version of the noise-heavy, \\"highly textured\\" pop sound that was prevalent on Sleep ‚àû Over's previous releases. According to Kelly, two types of tracks are prevalent on the record: slow-tempo new wave dance music and experimental music with moods that range from ambient and majestic to harsh and avant-garde. Popmatters reviewer Zachary Houle wrote that the album alternates between two types of tracks: slow-paced \\"melodic keyboard pop\\" and experimental psychedelic noise pop instrumentals similar to songs on The Moody Blues album On the Threshold of a Dream (1969). Castor Green spotlighted the record's \\"full\\" sound, consisting of \\"meaty basslines, banks of drums and at times, drawn-out crescendos that recall more experimental recent albums by Julia Holter or Roly Porter.\\" Writer Austin Powell labeled Forever in the same league as the works of Pure X and Neon Indian in that it was \\"redefining Texas slowcore for the chillwave generation.\\" Critic Guy Frowny categorized the tracks into three types of styles: guitar-heavy drone music, ambient industrial music and slow- tempo, lo-fi synthesizer songs; he labeled the album's alternation between and combination of these styles to serve as its hegelian dialectic that attempts to lead to an \\"unrealized\\" solution. There are \\"moments where the synth lines bend and distort, purposefully disfiguring the music‚Äôs beauty for a moment both fleeting and fearful.\\" Frowny suggests that Franciotti sings in a manner where Forever involves a voyeur who listens to her \\"private\\" lullabies, and the listeners are \\"overhearing\\" these lullabies rather than Franciotti singing to the listeners. Franciotti's vocal performance garnered comparisons to the works of Laurel Halo, My Bloody Valentine and ethereal vocals present in the 1990s works of acts like Love Spirals Downwards from journalists. Kelly analyzed Franciotti's vocal performance to range from \\"approachable and human\\" to \\"unremarkable, [...] like a slurry Hope Sandoval trapped in a bell jar.\\" Lyrically, Kelly described the songs as \\"frozen lullabies\\" consisting of problems that are figured with only an unsuggested tad bit of unsolved detail. Critical reception Reviews of Forever were generally favorable. Green called the LP a \\"strong\\" debut, writing that its songcrafting is what made it unique from most underground lo-fi 1980s-synth-music-influenced acts in the 2010s. In a mixed review, journalist Zachary Houle called Forever a \\"schizophrenic lo-fi keyboard-based version of early Sebadoh in its fractured sense of unity.\\" He mainly criticized the record's \\"padded\\" and \\"formless\\" instrumentals but praised the \\"fragility\\" of the vocals that gave the album \\"structure.\\" Track listing #Behind Closed Doors #Romantic Streams #Porcelain Hands #The Heavens Turn By Themselves #Casual Diamond #Crying Game #Flying Saucers Are Real #Stickers #Untitled #Don‚Äôt Poison Everything References Category:2011 albums ","title":"Forever (Sleep ‚àû Over album)"},{"id":"49214596","text":"Warren Koegel (born November 1, 1949) is a former American football player and college athletics administrator.

Not known for his punching power, (Marquez only won 7 of his 46 professional boxing fights by knockout), Marquez nevertheless gave many of the top boxers of his era trouble and managed to defeat a number of them. Amateur boxing career Marquez had an excelling amateur boxing career, which led him to participate at the 1965 Central American and Caribbean Games, held in San Juan and where he boxed all the way to the medals round but was disqualified from further participation because he had problems making the weight for a fight. He was the national amateur Bantamweight champion in Puerto Rico that year, his amateur career culminating in his winning the international Bantamweight championshiphttp://www.famadeportesrp.org/exaltados/perfiles/1999/josue.html as well as the United States' national AAU Bantamweight championship early in 1966, months before he started boxing as a professional.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Josue_Marquez Professional boxing career Marquez began to box professionally on August 20, 1966, when he beat Alberto Jorge, who was also making his debut, by a four round decision at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. This was followed by a victory over future Juan Laporte trainer,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/sports/laporte- holds-title-on-a-split-decision.html Carlos Espada (brother of Angel Espada) on October 1. Espada was also making his debut. Marquez's next bout was against Carlos' brother, the future WBA world welterweight champion Angel Espada. Espada was also a debutant. On February 11, 1967, Marquez outpointed the future world champion over six rounds, winning by decision. On March 23, he fought Richard Alexander and won by four round split decision, also in what was his first fight abroad, fought at the Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. A rematch with Alberto Jorge followed on April 5 at San Juan and he again beat Jorge by four rounds decision. Only three days after his rematch with Jorge, Marquez followed by fighting the far more experienced, 10-5-5 Jose Colon, at the Cancha Pepin Cestero in the northern Puerto Rican city of Bayamon. On April 8, 1967, Marquez defeated Colon by six round decision, then on May 5, he boxed Ernesto Ortega at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, suffering a mild upset defeat when Ortega, 3-2 coming in, outpointed Marquez over six rounds. The loss was followed by a fight against debuting \\"Indio\\" Macias on September 16, in which Marquez scored his first knockout win as a professional, defeating Macias by knockout in round three. On October 20, 1967, Marquez and Carlos Espada fought a rematch; this time around, Marquez repeated his four round points victory over Espada, and then, on March 15, 1968, Marquez made his New York City debut, fighting fellow Puerto Rican Angel Torres, a respected prospect who had won nine bouts and lost one prior to Marquez fighting him. This bout took place at the National Maritime Union Hall and Marquez prevailed by eight round decision. Josue Marquez and Jose Colon fought a rematch on April 29, 1968, at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. By this time, Colon's record was 11 wins, 11 losses and 6 draws. Marquez scored his second career knockout win when he beat a shopworn Colon in the second round, and then traveled to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to fight debuting Jose Anglada on June 29, defeating Anglada by a six round decision. Another rematch followed that win, this time against Angel Torres, by then 9-2. On August 15 at San Juan, Marquez once again beat Torres, by eight rounds decision. Marquez had a lay-off of almost one year after the Torres rematch, but he returned with a win, on July 5, 1969, over previously undefeated (6-0-1) Joe Cartwright by a fifth round technical knockout in San Juan. Keeping a busy schedule, Marquez faced Eddie Linder, a fighter with a 25-4-6 record, on August 9, barely one month and four days after the Cartwright knockout. Marquez won by eight rounds decision and twenty one days later saw off the challenge of Benny Huertas (who would famously oppose Roberto Dur√°n in Dur√°n's Madison Square Garden debut two years later) on August 30, outpointing the 11-9-3 fighter over eight rounds in San Juan. On October 11 of that year (1969), he faced Bobo Akerson of the Bronx, New York., stopping the 8-4 contender in round eight at San Juan. On November 1, he stopped Jorge Nogueras in three rounds at San Juan. This fight was a mismatch; Nogueras was 0-1 coming in. A far more experienced boxer, Jerry Graci, awaited Marquez in his next fight; Graci was 16-15-5 in 36 professional contests when he and Marquez duly met on December 6 at San Juan. Marquez closed out his 1969 campaign with a ten rounds points victory over Graci in San Juan. On January 10, 1970, Marquez traded gloves with Bobby Joe Hughes, a 9 win, 11 loss trial horse, and he defeated Hughes by ten round decision in San Juan. On March 14, he faced Marcus Anderson, who was 17-1, also at San Juan. Marquez won this fight by seventh round knockout, and then in April, Marquez traveled to Italy to take on 19-7-6 Giampero Salami on April 18, at Cremona, Lombardia. Marquez lost this bout for his second loss as a professional, by eight round decision. Having returned from Italy to Puerto Rico, Marquez boxed Rocky Orengo only 12 days after the Salami bout, on April 30, 1970. Orengo was 7-9-2 coming into their bout, held at San Juan. Marquez defeated Orengo by ten round decision. =Fight with Miguel Velazquez= Miguel Velazquez is a Spaniard who by 1970 was world-ranked, with a record of 40-1-1. Velazquez had just won the vacant European Lightweight title with a 15 round decision over future world Lightweight champion and International Boxing Hall of Fame member, Ken Buchanan. When Marquez and Velazquez met, May 22, 1970 at Madrid, Spain's Palacio de los Deportes, they fought for a better world ranking among the top ten Junior Welterweights of the time, Marquez weighing 136 and a half pounds and Velazquez 138, one and a half and three pounds over the Lightweight division's weight limit, respectively, but also 3 and a half and 2 pounds under the Junior Welterweight division's weight limit. Despite putting much resistance, Marquez dropped a ten round decision to Velazquez. Velazquez later became a world champion, winning and losing the World Boxing Council's world Junior Welterweight championship against Thailand's Saensak Muangsurin. Immediately following the fight with Velazquez, Marquez returned to Italy for a rematch against Giampiero Salami, on June 26 at Ancona. Once again, however, he lost to Salami, this time outpointed over eight rounds. Three months later, Marquez returned to the boxing ring, facing fellow Puerto Rican contender Hector Matta, who was 9-3. On September 26 at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, Marquez obtained a ten round decision win over Matta. Marquez did not fight again for the rest of 1970, taking seven months and a half to return to the ring, to fight Carlos Penzo in San Juan. This fight was also a mismatch, as Penzo had only fought once, losing that fight. Marquez beat Penzo by ten round decision May 15, 1971. =Puerto Rican Lightweight championship= After the Penzo bout, Marquez was allowed to challenge for the vacant Puerto Rican national Lightweight championship. His rival, Victor Ortiz (not to be confused with the latter world champion boxer and actor of the same name) was 11-2, when he and Marquez faced off on June 20, 1971 in San Juan. Marquez won the Puerto Rican Lightweight title when he outpointed Ortiz over twelve rounds, giving Marquez his first professional championship. Ortiz would go on to become the 5th ranked Junior Welterweight in the world by the WBA and challenge Antonio Cervantes unsuccessfully for his world title. =Esteban De Jesus= On his next fight, Marquez would face his biggest test until that time, up and coming Puerto Rican prospect and future WBC Lightweight champion of the world, Esteban De Jesus, who was undefeated and untied in 20 bouts. De Jesus was a rising star in Puerto Rico, the rest of Latin America and the United States when he and Marquez first boxed each other, on July 24, only a month and four days after Marquez had won the national championship. In a twelve round fight, De Jesus took the title away from Marquez, winning by a points decision. The two had a rematch on September 4, once again in San Juan. De Jesus was again deemed winner on points after twelve rounds to retain the national Lightweight title. Marquez followed those two confrontations with a draw against George Foster, who was 13-5 before their December 3 bout at the Felt Forum in New York, and a split decision win on January 21, 1972 against well regarded trial-horse Doc McClendon, 8-7-1, also at the Felt Forum, before challenging De Jesus for a second time; their third bout overall, with De Jesus' Puerto Rican national title on the line was fought not in Puerto Rico, but at the Felt Forum in New York City, on May 21 of 1972. Once again, Marquez was defeated by De Jesus, this time by a twelfth round knockout. The referee for the third De Jesus-Marquez bout was Arthur Mercante. Marquez then met a debutant boxer, Radames Checo, in a mismatch held on July 28 at Caguas, Puerto Rico. Marquez beat Checo by ten round unanimous decision, and Checo would go on to lose all fourteen of his professional boxing bouts.http://boxrec.com/boxer/22800 =World title challenge= On February 15, 1973, Marquez challenged Colombian Antonio Cervantes for his World Boxing Association Junior Welterweight championship of the world. Held at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, this was the first world title fight staged at that venue. Cervantes is a relatively tall man with long arms, but Marquez gave him a close fight for fifteen rounds before the world champion was deemed victor and retainer of his world crown by a split decision. According to boxing magazine The Ring, Marquez landed a short left hook in round three that dropped the champion, but the fall was scored a slip by the referee, Venezuela's Juan Carlos Tapia. In round fifteen, Cervantes dropped Marquez. Nine thousand people attended the bout, most of whom felt that Cervantes was the correct winner. Ring Magazine saw the bout at 147-141 for the Colombian champion.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:17059 Marquez's father died later on the day after his challenge with Cervantes was finished; having watched the bout in person, he (Marquez's father) suffered a heart attack and died shortly after.http://www.famadeportesrp.org/exaltados/perfiles/1999/josue.html =Rest of professional career= Six months after his world title challenge of Cervantes, Marquez was back in the ring, facing 3-2 Ronald Whyms, whom Marquez outpointed over ten rounds at San Juan on August 21. Then came a trip to Australia to meet Hector Thompson, 41-3-2, on November 5 at the Brisbane Festival Hall in Brisbane. Marquez lost that fight by ten round decision, but returned to the winning column by defeating super-veteran Angel Robinson Garcia, by then 128-65-19, also by ten round decision, back home in San Juan on February 8, 1974. Marquez boxed future Wilfred Benitez world title challenger Emiliano Villa, by then 13-1, at Barranquilla, Colombia, on July 7 of that year, losing a ten round decision, then awaited almost one year outside the professional boxing ring before coming back, after he promptly lost to another one of Cervantes' world title challengers, the 16-3-2 Adriano Marrero of the Dominican Republic, by a ten round decision at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan on June 28, 1975. One month and a half later, he was back in Colombia, to face 15-2-2 prospect, Miguel Betruz, whom Marquez outpointed over ten rounds at a bullring in Cartagena, on August 16, as part of the card that featured the then WBC recognized world Middleweight champion Rodrigo Valdez retain his belt with a 15 round decision over Rudy Robles.http://boxrec.com/show/18232 Marquez fought Frankie Benitez, Wilfred's brother, on December 13, 1975. With a record of 22 wins and 2 losses, Benitez was considered a prospect by fans and the press alike, but Marquez derailed him with a ten round decision win in San Juan. The pair had a rematch on April 17, 1976, this time at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, where they fought to a ten round draw (tie). Another rematch followed the second Marquez-Benitez encounter, this time against Adriano Marrero, by now 22-6-2. This fight was also fought at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum, by then a world boxing hotbed. In a card headlined by Alfredo Escalera's defense of his WBC world Junior Lightweight championship against Ray Lunny III (which Escalera won by 12th. round knockout), Marquez and Marrero battled again, on Saturday, September 18, 1976, when Marquez avenged his previous loss to Marrero, winning by ten round decision.http://boxrec.com/show/44494 The win against Marrero turned out to be the last victory of note Marquez achieved in his professional boxing career, since he only fought twice more: first, against a boxer with an 0-3 record, Rolando Garcia, knocked out in four rounds on March 17, 1977 at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Then Marquez faced Edwin Viruet, who had just come from lasting the full 15 round distance with Roberto Dur√°n in a world title attempt; completing a total of 25 rounds against Dur√°n divided in two fights without getting knocked out by the Panamanian. Viruet knocked Marquez out in round ten on April 8, 1978 at the Juan Ramon Loubriel stadium in San Juan, after which Marquez decided to retire from professional boxing. Marquez won 32, losing 12 and tying 2 of his 46 professional boxing fights, winning 7 and losing 2 of those by knockout. As a trainer Marquez turned to training professional boxers for a while after he himself retired as a fighter. Among those he trained were future Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez opponent Javier Fragoso, Reynaldo \\"Pelayin\\" Hernandez, Wilfredo Riverahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyTnrrvHhbU, Julio Cesar Chavez, Sr.https://www.elnuevodia.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/falleceelexboxeadorjosuemarquez-2422015/ and Alberto Mercado (the latter before Mercado joined the Bairoa Gym).http://www.famadeportesrp.org/exaltados/perfiles/1999/josue.html Personal life Marquez had a long lasting marriage to Milagros Velez, with whom he had two daughters, Yamil and Xiomara Marquez. In 1999, he was inducted into the Rio Piedras sports Hall of Fame in Puerto Rico.http://www.famadeportesrp.org/exaltados/perfiles/1999/josue.html Marquez was friends with Wilfred Benitez's mother, Clara, until her death in 2008. He owned business interests in San Juan. Death Marquez died on Tuesday, May 10, 2018 of renal failure.

Kathryn Joyce for The American Prospect. May 5, 2014 The Next Christian Abuse Scandal: By Grace Alone He became convinced that Evangelical institutions were not properly addressing incidents of sexual abuse, incidents that he believed would eventually lead to scandals similar to those that had damaged the Catholic Church. In Tchividjian's view, the legalistic, authoritarian culture of some Protestant organizations was particularly susceptible to what he called \\"spiritual abuse\\" ‚Äî the attempt of religious leaders to silence victims or convince them that they deserved their abuse. Tchividjian has stated that \\"When it comes to child sexual abuse, too many churches and Christian organizations prefer to sacrifice individuals in order to protect themselves. We end up living out the very antithesis of the Gospel that we preach. The consequences are devastating.\\" Tchividjian first contacted Victor Vieth, who previously headed the Gundersen National Child Protection Training Center, and Diane Langberg, a psychologist from Pennsylvania who specialized in trauma and subsequently the three invited a number of legal, therapeutic and clerical professionals to form a board that created GRACE, an organization dedicated to educating churches and parachurch organizations about preventing, detecting, and dealing with sexual abuse.

According to the General Services Administration (GSA), the $376-million project, which involved a multi-story excavation adjacent to the West Wing, was to replace electrical wiring and update air conditioning. A second phase of the project, with an unannounced start date, will involve a similar excavation adjacent to the East Wing. Funds for the White House Big Dig were allocated by a congressional appropriation made in late 2001. Despite the utilitarian description of its purpose, the project came to be the object of intense media speculation. The Washington Post characterized the GSA description of the project as a \\"nothing to see here story\\" while The New York Times, citing an anonymous source, claimed it was \\"security-related construction.\\" The Associated Press reported that a privacy screen was placed around the construction site for its duration and sub-contractors on the project were required to cover identifying marks or logos on their company vehicles, measures it implied were unusual. ABC News, meanwhile, equated the construction project as a \\"mystery\\" on-par with \\"what happened to the dinosaurs\\".

History  The party largely developed out of a correspondence program with prisoners that supported Amerindian spirituality. Over time, Tom Watts, the program's leader, developed it into a revolutionary group that branched out to create another group focused on African American culture. Eventually, many factions developed in the group and a Maoist splinter group emerged as the New Afrikan Black Panther Party. The party helped organize the other splinter groups and create two subgroups in itself to organize prisoners of all races, the White Panther Organization and the Brown Panther Organization. The party ran a newsletter and often corresponded to prisoners, all run by a single party member. The party still distributes literature in prisons, although it may be censored at times.

Henle also taught at the New School of Social Research in New York; she was involved in the writing of eight book publications and also helped develop the first psychology laboratory manual in 1948 based on the famous works of Kurt Lewin. Schooling and life Mary Henle was born to a Jewish familyJewish Women's Archives: \\"Psychology in the United States\\" by Rhoda K. Unger] retrieved March 26, 2017 on July 14, 1913 in Cleveland, Ohio, raised in family that placed a strong emphasis on education.see the entry for Mary Henly in Psychology's Feminist Voices Mary Henle's mother Pearl Hahn Henle was a physician. Pearl's father, without being asked, enrolled Pearl into the study of medicine where she became one of the best physicians of the time. Henle's father Leo immigrated from Stuttgart, Germany to the United States in 1880 at the age of 15. Leo Henle moved to the United States for economic reasons and to pursue his dream of becoming a scientist. Unfortunately he was unable to become a scientist and settled as being a businessman while still continuing his education. Growing up in this academic environment encouraged Henle and her siblings to be strong in their academics. Her brother, Paul, became a professor of philosophy and her sister, Jane, studied archeology.see the entry for Mary Henly in Psychology's Feminist Voices Mary Henle first attended Smith College in 1930, where she got her bachelor's degree in French followed by her bachelor's degree in psychology in 1934. She then furthered her education in psychology by receiving her master's degree in 1935. While pursuing her master's degree, Henle met with James J. Gibson, Eleanor J. Gibson and Kurt Koffka, all very renowned teachers. Henle's encounter with Koffka aroused her interest in Gestalt Psychology, prompting her to want to know more about the idea. Henle went on to get her Ph.D. at Bryn Mawr College where she was hired as an assistant for Harry Helson. Under Helson's watch she was able to get a solid education in experimental methods. Henle then met Donald W. MacKinnon (who had studied Gestalt psychology in Berlin), this began her interactions with Kurt Lewin and introduced her to his kind of experimental research.see the entry for Mary Henly in Psychology's Feminist Voices Henle completed her doctorate in 1939, followed by being a research assistant at Swarthmore College to Robert B. MacLeod. During this period there was also an encounter with Wolfgang K√∂hler. MacLeod, who had studied in Berlin, had invited Wolfgang K√∂hler to Swarthmore, where he taught until 1955. Henle visited K√∂hler's seminars and was involved in experimental research with him. This resulted in a close intellectual relationship that lasted till K√∂hler's death in 1967. In 1941 Henle worked as a professor at the University of Delaware for one year until war efforts opened many jobs for psychologists.see the entry for Mary Henly in Psychology's Feminist Voices In 1942 Harry Helson called Henle back to Bryn Mawr, where she first taught psychology for graduate students. After two years of teaching, Henle was appointed to the psychological institute of Sarah Lawrence College (1944-1946). In 1946 Solomon Asch invited Henle, on K√∂hler's recommendation, to become a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York. She remained there for the rest of her career (1946-1983), where she published empirical research and claimed herself as a Gestalt psychologist.see the entry for Mary Henly in Psychology's Feminist Voices In an autobiographical retrospective Henle paid tribute to the many positive, supportive circumstances and assistantships that she had received for her scientific career. But she had not forgotten the difficulties that she faced as a woman and as a Jew in the academic world of the United States, especially in the 1930s.see the entry for Mary Henly in Psychology's Feminist Voices Works The empirical research of Mary Henle was concerned initially (along with Koffka) with perception problems, followed by research in motivational studies and investigations on surrogate activity (1942, 1944). In the tradition of Kurt Lewin, she also studied the psychology of thinking and the possibilities of a phenomenological approach of personality psychology, including questions of rationality and of the relationship between thinking and logic. In 1948, Henle published a handbook with D.W. MacKinnon based on the experimental research of psychodynamics.See the laboratory manual of 1948. Later Henle turned to intensively researching the history of ideas in psychology.E. Ragsdale (2008): Mary Henle (1913-2007). Gestalt Theory, 30 (1), 98-99; G. Stemberger (2010): Life and work of Mary Henle (1913-2007). Ph√§nomenal 2 (2), 45-50. Henle was an addition to their own research life striving to make the Gestalt theory of the Berlin school (Wertheimer, K√∂hler, Koffka et al.) in their authentic basic positions in the United States known to represent and defend their view falsifying interpretations: In 1961, Henle gave the anthology Documents of Gestalt Psychology out, which after 1938 published collection A Sourcebook of Gestalt Psychology (edited by Willis D. Ellis.). An updated representation of important core positions of Gestalt theory was present: The tape contained a representation of the \\" Gestalt theory today \\"by Wolfgang K√∂hler, the essays from Max Wertheimer about truth, theory of ethics, democracy and freedom. This sourcebook also included a series of essays by Wolfgang K√∂hler, Rudolf Arnheim, Hans Wallach, Solomon E. Asch, Mary Henle herself and others on key issues of psychological theory, cognitive processes, social psychology and motivation and psychology of expression, art and emotion. In 1970 he published the book in Italian translation. Ten years later the anthology \\"Selected Papers of Wolfgang K√∂hler\\" (1971), the previously scattered essays K√∂hler followed the epistemological, psychophysical, cognitive psychological and epistemological positions of Gestalt theory presented new available. Henle's self-image as a representative and defender of the gestalt theory tradition finally comes perhaps most in the foreground in her 1986 anthology 1879 And All That. Essays in the Theory and History of Psychology. This anthology contains some of her most incisive essays on key issues of Gestalt theory, the concepts, assumptions and terms used in psychology to scrutinize more carefully on their intellectual historical background and its actual meaning. In the field of psychotherapy theory one of her papers dealt in depth with the late work of Fritz Perls, founder of Gestalt therapy, Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy (1975). Henle criticizes in this essay (article version of a lecture before the American Psychological Association) the incorrect equating of Gestalt psychology and Gestalt therapy (mainly in the US) (see links). Henle's essay was criticized by some representatives of Gestalt therapy with the argument that Henle unilaterally refers only to Perls' three recent books and ignores the rest of Gestalt therapy literature, and thereby creates a distorting image of Gestalt theraopy.Allen R. Barlow:. had \\"Gestalt Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident\\", The Gestalt Journal , Volume IV, Number 2, (case 1981). Henle had their choice, however, already justified in their paper so that Perls himself had explained his earlier works in retrospect.Mary Henle, Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy (PDF; 417 kB)., Introduction In addition, she was not to pass judgment on the psychotherapeutic treatment method, but getting to grips with some meta-theoretical statements of Perls and their relation to Gestalt theory.

It is one of the 16 hundreds of the County of Stanley. It was named in 1867 by Governor Dominick Daly after William Everard (1819‚Äì1889), a South Australian parliamentarian. The southern third of the locality of Condowie is also situated inside the bounds of the Hundred of Everard. =Local government= In 1888 the Hundred of Everard was annexed to the District Council of Blyth as part of the District Councils Act 1887. Not long after, on 26 September 1889, the hundred was severed from Blyth council and annexed instead to the District Council of Snowtown as the Everard ward. In 1912, at the instigation of resident landowners, a southern portion of the hundred south of Everard Road and including the Everard Central township, was severed from Snowtown council and added to the District Council of Balaklava as part of its Stow ward. From 1987, following the merging of Snowtown and Blyth councils, the larger north part of the hundred retained is ward status with 2 council representatives in the Blyth-Snowtown council. From 1997, following the Blyth-Snowtown amalgamation with the District Council of Wakefield Plains, the entire hundred became part of the much larger North ward of the Wakefield Regional Council.

Antinous and his friends at first treated the machinations of Charops with contempt, but when they saw that some of their friends were being arrested and conveyed to Rome, Antinous and Cephalus were compelled, for the sake of their own safety, openly, though unwillingly, to join the Macedonian side of the war, and the Molossians followed their example.

Due to limited access, suggestions have been made to make its banks into public amenities similar to that of San Antonio River Walk, or, developing a public use trail following the creek, similar to the bike path of Arroyo Simi in Simi Valley, California. It is part of the Calleguas Creek watershed, which drains an area of 343 sq. mi. in southern Ventura County.https://www.toacorn.com/articles/conejos-inconspicuous-creek/ Within Wildwood Regional Park, its gorge and its cascade, Paradise Falls, are among the park‚Äôs most visited attractions.Schad, Jerry (2013). 101 Hikes in Southern California: Exploring Mountains, Seashore, and Desert.

It runs from the Conejo Hills of Newbury Park, crosses horizontally Casa Conejo, before entering Thousand Oaks and Wildwood Regional Park. It originates in the Conejo Hills and streams into Hill Canyon and further into the Santa Rosa Valley, where it merges with Arroyo Santa Rosa and becomes Conejo Creek. Conejo Creek drains through the Pleasant Valley Basin, joins Calleguas Creek and enters into the Pacific Ocean by its estuary at Mugu Lagoon at the north end of the Santa Monica Mountains.http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/techrpt/85-7-15.pdf Its northern border is made up by the Santa Susana Mountains, South Mountain and the Oak Ridge Mountains.

Some of the fauna found in the creek includes the Western pond turtle and numerous species of amphibians: the California red-legged frog, Western toad, American bullfrog, California toad and the Pacific tree frog. Fish species include the Brown bullhead, Green sunfish, Bluntnose minnow, and Mosquitofish. It is an important habitat for various species of freshwater-nesting birds in the Conejo Valley. Some of the species include the Great blue heron, White- faced ibis, Black-crowned night heron, Green heron, Black-necked stilt, Great egret, Snowy egret, Belted kingfisher, Black phoebe, Killdeer, Common yellowthroat, Greater yellowlegs, American coot, and Mallard.Maxwell, Thomas J.

The resulting document laid the foundation for the establishment of the new military force (Bundeswehr) of the Federal Republic. The memorandum, along with the public declaration of Wehrmacht's \\"honour\\" by the Allied military commanders and West Germany's politicians, contributed to the creation of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht. Background The Potsdam Conference held by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States from 17 July to 2 August 1945, largely determined the occupation policies that the occupied country was to face after its defeat, including demilitarization, denazification, democratization and decentralization. The Allies' often crude and ineffective implementation caused the local population to dismiss the process as \\"noxious mixture of moralism and 'victors' justice'\\". For those in the Western zones of occupation, the advent of the Cold War undermined the demilitarization process by seemingly justifying the key part of Hitler's foreign policies, the \\"fight against Soviet bolshevism\\". In 1950, after the outbreak of the Korean War, the Americans felt that a West German army clearly had to be revived to help face off the Soviet Union, and American and West German politicians confronted the prospect of rebuilding the West German armed forces. Himmerod Abbey conference From 5 to 9 October 1950, a group of former senior officers, at the behest of Adenauer, met in secret at the Himmerod Abbey (hence the memorandum's name) to discuss West Germany's rearmament. The participants were divided in several subcommittees, which focused on the political, ethical, operational and logistical aspects of the future armed forces. The resulting memorandum included a summary of the discussions at the conference and bore the name \\"Memorandum on the Formation of a German Contingent for the Defense of Western Europe within the framework of an International Fighting Force\\". It was intended as both a planning document and a basis of negotiations with the Western Allies. The participants of the conference were convinced that no future German army would be possible without the historical rehabilitation of the Wehrmacht and so the memorandum included these key demands: *All German soldiers convicted as war criminals would be released. *The \\"defamation\\" of the German soldier, including those of the Waffen-SS, would have to cease. *\\"Measures to transform both domestic and foreign public opinion\\" with regards to the German military would need to be taken. The chairman of the conference summarised the foreign policy changes demanded in the memorandum with this comment: \\"Western nations must take public measures against the 'prejudicial characterization' of the former German soldiers and must distance the former regular armed forces from the 'war crimes issue'\\". Adenauer accepted the memorandum and began a series of negotiations with the three Western powers to satisfy those demands. Aftermath Adenauer accepted the propositions and, in turn, advised the representatives of the three Western powers that German armed forces would not be possible as long as German soldiers remained in custody. To accommodate the West German government, the Allies commuted a number of war crimes sentences. A public declaration from Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower followed in January 1951 that attested to the Wehrmacht's \\"honour\\". Prior to signing the declaration and discussing it with the press, Eisenhower met with former Wehrmacht Generals Adolf Heusinger and Hans Speidel, both of whom participated in the Himmerod conference, and was impressed by them. The declaration read in part: > I have come to know that there was a real difference between the German > soldier and Hitler and his criminal group.... For my part, I do not believe > that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. In the same year (1951), some former career officers of the Wehrmacht were granted war pensions under Article 131 of the Common Law. Eisenhower's public statement gave the former Wehrmacht generals the ability to expand on the revisionist work that they had already done for the United States Army Historical Division, thus getting their message beyond the small circle of Allied intelligence officers. Adenauer made a similar statement in a Bundestag debate on Article 131 of the Basic Law, West Germany's provisional constitution. He stated that the German soldier fought honourably as long as he \\"had not been guilty of any offense\\". The declarations laid the foundation of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, which reshaped the West's perception of the Nazi war effort and led to Wehrmacht's eventual rehabilitation in the eyes of the public and the Allied authorities.

Many of the forms it processes are prerequisites for people outside the United States who are not United States citizens or permanent residents to obtaining visas to enter the United States in the specified status. Many of the USCIS immigration forms have long processing times. The USCIS offers some guidance regarding expected processing times through its website and through reports. This page describes the USCIS policies, the guidance they offer, and the courses of action in case of higher processing times. Note that these processing times do not include the processing times for U.S. Department of Labor forms (such as Labor Condition Application and labor certification) that are prerequisites for some USCIS petitions and forms, nor do they include the National Visa Center wait times for immigrant visa numbers, the wait time for getting visas from a U.S. consulate abroad, or border wait times.  Various kinds of USCIS processing  The USCIS offers processing time information for many different kinds of processing: * Processing forms (applications and petitions) at its Service Centers: There are four service centers: California Service Center, Nebraska Service Center, Vermont Service Center, and Texas Service Center. All USCIS immigration forms (but not the naturalization forms) go through Service Centers. * Field Office processing: This is the final stage of processing for some forms that also require in-person interviews. These include Form I-485, Form N-400 and Form N-600. Note that when Form I-485 is filed concurrently with Form I-130, then the Form I-130 is first processed at the Service Center and then the Form I-485 is processed at the field office. The total wait time is the sum of the wait times for both forms. * National Benefits Center processing: Some USCIS immigration forms go through the NBC. These are Forms I-102, I-131, I-600, I-601A, I-765, I-817, I-824, and I-90. * Immigrant Investor Program Office processing: This Office processes Form I-526 petitions whose approval allows one to obtain an EB-5 visa). * International Operations Offices processing: International Operations offices are used for Direct Consular Filing for some forms, notably I-130 (most international offices), Form I-360, and Form I-730 (available only in some offices). * Administrative Appeals Office processing: This includes processing for appeals to USCIS decisions for most USCIS forms, with the exception of Form I-130 and Form I-360.  The USCIS processing queue  Each form or petition the USCIS receives is put in a queue for processing once it is received by the part of the USCIS (typically a service center or field office) that will process it. The queue that a form is put in depends on two aspects: * The service center or field office where the form is being processed. * The type of form (note that the form number alone does not determine the queue, because there may be many categories that use the same form number; for instance, Form I-129 is used for many different kinds of temporary work authorization, and each of them has a separate queue). Note that after initial review, if the form is awaiting a response from the applicant (to a Request For Evidence, Notice of Intent to Deny, or request for clarification), the application is placed in \\"active suspense\\" and is not part of the queue. The queue operates in a standard first in, first out fashion: a form that is put in the queue at a later date will start being reviewed or adjudicated at a later date (there is an exception for those who use the Premium Processing Service discussed later, that can be used for Form I-129 and Form I-140). The time between the date of receipt of the form by the service center or field office and the date it is reviewed is called the \\"processing time\\" of the form. Due to the way the queue operates, the processing times for forms processed close by in time will be similar. Therefore, to estimate processing times for forms that are currently being reviewed, it suffices to know the date of receipt. = Processing time goals and backlogs = For each form, USCIS has a processing time goal. These processing time goals are set by the USCIS Office of Performance and Quality (OPQ) that was established in January 2010. If the processing time at a given time for a particular service center and form is significantly higher than the processing time goal, USCIS may either increase allocation of resources within the Service Center to process that form, or (in some extreme cases) reallocate some of the caseload to a different service center. Typical reasons for increased backlog include significant additional demands on USCIS resources due to the introduction of new categories of forms or an increase in usage of existing forms. For instance, in the aftermath of Barack Obama's executive action on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in June 2012, the USCIS faced increased workloads, and this was one of the factors in significantly increased wait times for Form I-130 petitions. = Courses of action for delayed processing = For Form I-765 applications for an employment authorization document, there is a promised 90-day processing time. If a Form I-765 application is close to or beyond the 90-day processing timeframe, the applicant may take the following actions: * Contact the USCIS National Customer Service Center * Submit a case inquiry using DHS Form 7001 to the Ombudsman's Office For Forms I-129 and I-140, the petitioner may use the Premium Processing Service to get an initial review within 15 calendar days. The petitioner can obtain the Premium Processing Service for an already submitted application and can in fact obtain it electronically. The 15 calendar day clock begins from the time the petitioner's Premium Processing Service application is received by the USCIS. In general, if a petition or application has not received a response even though the USCIS is showing a later date of applications currently being processed, the petitioner or applicant can file an \\"outside normal processing time\\" e-request with the USCIS.  Reporting of processing times  On the 15th of every month, the USCIS publishes information, for each of its processing queues (i.e., for every combination of service center/field office/other subdivision and form type) the processing time as observed 45 days ago. For instance, on January 15, 2016, the USCIS published this information for forms being processed as of November 30, 2015. The 45-day gap is to allow the USCIS to verify the data for quality. Due to the 45-day delay in reporting, the information published by USCIS may not be very helpful to applicants for some forms whose processing times fluctuate wildly. The USCIS reports processing times in two formats for each combination of service center and form type. One is \\"Estimated time range\\" that could say something like \\"2 months to 4 months.\\" The other is \\"Receipt date for a case inquiry\\" that gives the average date of forms of that type processed on the date for which the report is being generated. For instance, in the data released on January 15, the USCIS reported the dates of forms being processed (for each combination of service center/field office/other subdivision and form category) as of November 30. A few other caveats need to be noted when interpreting reported processing times: * Initial review only; excludes active suspense: While all forms being processed for initial review are processed in the order in which they were received, forms that are re-processed after receiving a response to a Request For Evidence, Notice of Intent to Deny, or a request for clarification from the applicant may not bear a relationship with the date of receipt of the original form. Forms that are awaiting a response from the applicant are said to be in \\"active suspense\\". When reporting processing times, the USCIS removes data on forms in active suspense. This is part of the quality control done by the USCIS and is one of the reasons for the 45-day delay in reporting. * Data skewed by Premium Processing: The USCIS does not separate out data for petitions that have requested the Premium Processing Service, i.e., its estimate of processing time includes both petitions that have requested Premium Processing and those that have not. While this does not affect form categories ineligible for Premium Processing, it does skew the reported processing times for the forms eligible for Premium Processing. For instance, a Form I-129 petition that did not have a Premium Processing Service request will likely take more time to process than the processing time reported by the USCIS. * Guidelines for processing times for petitions after they receive a response to a RFE or NOID: There are no general processing times reported for petitions after they receive a response to a RFE or NOID, since it varies from case to case, and it is best to communicate directly with the Service Center.  Additional statistics  The USCIS also publishes quarterly reports (i.e., once every three months) for each form giving detailed statistics (by field office/service center location) of the number of applications received, accepted, denied, and pending.  Premium Processing Service  The USCIS offers a Premium Processing Service at an additional fee of $1440 for Form I-129 (non-immigrant worker) and Form I-140 (immigrant worker) petitions. The Premium Processing Service has a fee of $1225 and promises an initial review from the USCIS within 15 calendar days of receipt of the form, after which time it may approve, deny, or issue a Request For Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny. For the special case of cap-subject H-1B visas where the applications are concentrated in the beginning of April, the start date for the 15-day countdown is generally delayed due to the huge influx of applications. The Premium Processing Service was introduced in 2001 for Form I-129 and extended to Form I-140 in 2006. The USCIS has been asked to extend the Premium Processing Service to Form I-526 (for EB-5 investors) and has also formulated proposals to do so, but as of January 2016, still uses the Premium Processing Service only for Forms I-129 and I-140.

Headquartered in New York City, the company has offices in Christchurch, New Zealand, London, UK, Washington, DC, Charlotte, Amsterdam, and Munich. Diligent was listed on the New Zealand NZX main board stock exchange under ticker code DIL. The company‚Äôs main products are based on a software as a service (SaaS) model and sold by subscription. These include corporate governance technologies, such as a board portal, entity governance, director messaging, and voting tools for board directors and executives. Diligent‚Äôs products are used by 60 percent of all Fortune 1000 companies. History= Early history = Diligent was founded by Brian Henry and Kiri Borg in 1994 as Manhattan Creative Partners (MCP). In 1998, SunAmerica became a client of Manhattan Creative Partners after SunAmerica director Peter Harbeck and Brian Henry discovered a joint passion as airplane owners and recreational pilots. In 1999, Alessandro Sodi was hired and trained by Henry and Borg to assist in account management. Eventually, Henry turned over the day-to-day management of the SunAmerica account to Sodi. In 2000, when SunAmerica expressed their desire to do away with their burdensome hard-copy corporate board paper books, Henry conceived of and hand-drew the design for the original and first web-based \\"Boardbook.\\" Marco Morsella, the first employee hired by Henry and Borg in 1997 to be MCP's graphic designer, created a digital GUI based on Henry's design. SunAmerica became the first company to license the new, web-based Boardbook. Henry and Borg, and later the Diligent Partners, recognized the value of this innovative technology and invested most of the profits from other consultancy projects into the continuing development of the new software product. = New company = In 2003, Henry and Borg formed Diligent Partners, together with Sharon Daniels, Dan Kiley, Kenneth Carroll, Alessandro Sodi, Marc Daniels and Robert Craig. Henry was named CEO of the new entity, Sodi, President, and Carroll, Chairman. At the same time, the company renamed MCP to Diligent Board Member Services \\"to reflect the firm's shift of focus to corporate governance service delivery.\\" By 2006, Diligent had expanded to Europe, Canada, and the UK. =Initial public offering= Diligent listed on the New Zealand Exchange (NZX) in 2007 with a $24m NZX IPO, valuing the company at $115m. While fundraising for the company was successful, prior to the company listing some information became public regarding bankruptcies of original founder and CEO Brian Henry and his brother Gerald Henry. These bankruptcies occurred in the late 1980s due to the 1987 share market crash. Gerald Henry was given jail term for fraud in 1991 due to a subset of US law. Diligent released a statement clarifying that Gerald Henry was not associated with the company. The day following Diligent's listing, the company announced Henry's resignation as CEO due to the oversight of the disclosure of this information. However, some journalists at the time claimed that Diligent's PR firm and attorneys \\"should have advised Henry to publicly acknowledge his history.\\" In fact, Diligent's IPO attorney, Mark Russell, said his firm, Buddle Findlay, \\"was proud to have our brand associated with Diligent and with Brian in particular. We have no concerns whatsoever.\\" It was reported that \\"Diligent's promoters and directors, including director Mark Russell of law firm Buddle Findlay, knew of Brian's connection with Energycorp, but decided not to disclose. Coincidentally, Russell, in the 1980s worked for the Bank of New Zealand, which had lent the company $15.5m on a handshake.\\" Henry was replaced by Alessandro Sodi, who was then President. Henry remained on the Board, his value to the company recognised by the other members of the board. Diligent's share price collapsed to $0.14 by March 2009 but later recovered to lead the pack of technology listings. =Company growth and revenue restatement issues= With the release of the Apple iPad in 2010, Diligent developed an app for this new platform and commenced a period of explosive growth in client numbers. Diligent made its first operating profit in 2012. Between 2011 and 2012, company revenue grew by 165%. By mid-2013, the Diligent stock price had reached over $8.00 NZD a share. In August 2013, Diligent announced that it would need to restate revenue for the current and preceding three years due to discrepancies in company accounting practices. No fraud was involved, though the company was required to recognize revenue from the date of a contract being signed rather than the start of a month, and its installation fees recognized over a longer period of time. The company also acknowledged that its accounting systems were underdeveloped and required improvement. It was fined by the NZX for a number of minor breaches of listing rules. Alessandro Sodi stepped down as CEO 2015 to focus on the launch of Diligent Teams as Chief Product Strategy Officer. Sodi was succeeded by current CEO Brian Stafford, an ex-Mckinsey partner and software-as-a-service specialist. = Return to private ownership = On 14 February 2016, Diligent announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Insight Partners for consideration of $4.90 per share, valuing the company at $624M USD, subject to approval from the shareholders. A Shareholder meeting was held in Auckland, NZ on 13 April 2016 and having received 57% votes in favor of the Merger (as it was structured), Diligent de-listed from the NZX and returned into private hands. The merger was opposed by the NZ Shareholders Association who considered the offer too low, stating that \\"current offer is low compared to where the company's prospects have been in the past\\" Since 2016, Diligent has restructured its leadership team and acquired new companies, including Brainloop, BoardPad, Boardroom Resources and Manzama. In December 2018, Diligent announced the launch of the Diligent Institute, a think tank aiming to provide customers with global research on governance practices. In June 2020, Diligent launched its Modern Leadership initiative and partnered with ten private equity companies to improve board-level diversity. Each private equity firm agreed to open board seats of five of their portfolio companies to racially diverse candidates. The private equity firms included Insight Partners, Vista Equity Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Hg, and Genstar Capital.  Corporate affairs = Leadership = Diligent is managed by CEO Brian Stafford. Other key executives are: * Amanda Carty, Chief Marketing Officer * Avigail Dadone, Chief People Officer * Michael Flickman, Chief Technology Office * Jeffrey Hilk, Chief Revenue Office * Michael Stanton, Chief Financial Officer * Ken Surdan, Chief Product Officer * Jack Van Arsdale, Vice President of Legal = Customer and revenue = As of 2019, the company reported more than 16,500 customers and 550,000 individual users from more than 90 countries. In 2018, the company reported revenues exceeding $200 million and in July 2019 crossed $300 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). =Products= Diligent‚Äôs products are based on a software as a service (SaaS) model and sold by subscription. They are joined within the ‚ÄúGovernance Cloud‚Äù and offer a secure set of corporate governance software. After the COVID-19 outbreak Diligent in March 2020 started to offer K‚Äì12 public school districts and mission-based nonprofits free access to its board software. Awards Diligent was recognized in the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 two times, ranking #98 in 2014 and #420 in 2016. In 2018 and 2019, Diligent was named one of Inc. 5000‚Äôs Fastest Growing Private Companies in America.

He has served one term in the House of Councillors for the Tottori At-large district. After being elected in 2010 as a candidate for the Liberal Democratic Party, he changed parties three times before unsuccessfully seeking re-election as an independent candidate in 2016. Early life and pre-political career Hamada was born in Yonago, Tottori on 17 March 1953. His father was employed at Japanese National Railways and his mother was from a farming family. He graduated from the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies with a degree in Chinese language in 1975 and joined Nippon Steel the same year. After leaving Nippon Steel Hamada joined the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., becoming a Fellow and Associate Director in 1987. He obtained a Ph.D. in political science from George Washington University in 1992. In 1995 he became a consultant at the United States' Congressional Research Service. Political career Hamada contested the Tottori at-large district of the national House of Councillors at the July 2010 election as a candidate for the Liberal Democratic Party. He won the seat with 50.2% percent of the vote and defeated the Democratic Party of Japan candidate Mari Sakano, the granddaughter of Shigenobu Sakano, a former LDP member who had held the seat from 1986 until his death in April 2002. On 27 June 2011, whilst still a member of the opposition LDP, Hamada was offered a position in the government of Naoto Kan as Vice-Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications. The position would see Hamada be responsible for recovery efforts arising from the March 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. He resigned from the LDP and joined the ministry the following day. The LDP responded to the move a week later by rejecting his resignation and instead expelling him from the party. He sat as an independent for several months before joining the People's New Party on 29 December 2011. In September 2011 Kan was replaced as prime minister by Yoshihiko Noda. Hamada became a Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in Noda's cabinet and remained in the position until the DPJ were defeated by the LDP in the December 2012 general election. The People's New Party also performed poorly in the election, and in the aftermath Hamada became Secretary-General of the party. By March 2013 he and party leader Shozaburo Jimi were the only party members remaining in the Diet and they decided to disband the party. Whilst again sitting as an independent, he caused some controversy in April 2014 during United States President Barack Obama's state visit to Japan by claiming that Michelle Obama's absence from the visit was evidence that the couple were \\"negotiating a divorce\\". Hamada joined the Party for Future Generations in November 2014, which changed its name to the Party for Japanese Kokoro in December 2015. From the same time Hamada served as the party's Diet leader. =2016 re-election campaign= In April 2016 Hamada resigned from the Party for Japanese Kokoro and joined Initiatives from Osaka. Hamada's Tottori constituency was to be merged with the Shimane at-large district to create the Tottori-Shimane at- large district and contesting the new seat as a minor party candidate against Kazuhiko Aoki, the LDP's incumbent member for Shimane, would prove too difficult. Instead Hamada received a nomination to contest the summer 2016 election from the national proportional representation block as an Initiatives from Osaka candidate. However, on Friday 27 May 2016 Hamada caused controversy when he was absent from the House of Councillors, which was debating bills related to relief following the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes, in order to attend a party meeting in Osaka for Osaka prefectural representatives. He greeted the meeting by saying \\"I have come today to say a greeting to the all-star cast in attendance\\". His attendance was intended to gain support within the party for his national block campaign, and Hamada later explained that he had the party's permission to be absent from the House debate. However, the party's leader in the Osaka Prefectural Assembly, Kazunori Ohashi, said the party was unaware of his intended absence. On the following Monday, party secretary- general announced that the party had removed Hamada as a candidate, saying that his absence from the House in order to progress his re-election campaign was \\"extremely regrettable\\". Hamada submitted his resignation to the party on the same day, which was accepted the following day, 1 June 2016. Hamada nominated for the July House of Councillors election as an independent candidate in the six-seat Tokyo at-large district. He came 16th in a field of 31 candidates, receiving just 0.5% of the vote. Meanwhile, Aoki won the merged Tottori-Shimane district with 62.7% of the vote in a three-candidate race.

Synopsis A haunting portrait of stolen childhood, Starless Dreams plunges the viewer into the lives of seven young teenage girls sharing temporary quarters at a rehabilitation and correction center on the outskirts of Tehran. As the New Year approaches, the girls bond and reveal with disarming and often playful honesty the circumstances and acts that resulted in their incarceration. One girl killed her father; another robbed a bank; another was arrested for carrying 651 grams of cocaine. The girls' sisterly bond brings them to sing and dance with hope and allows them to share their tears. Outside the prison walls, danger is everywhere, even within their own families. Oskouei, one of Iran's most prominent directors, spent seven years securing access to this all-female facility. With incredible empathy, Starless Dreams delivers an unforgettable cinematic portrayal of restored innocence and humanity.

American news and culture paper The Village Voice ranked the documentary 7th Among Village Voice Top 25 Films.https://financialtribune.com/articles/art-and-culture/79017/starless- dreams-7th-among-village-voice-top-25-films Meanwhile, the movie gained 85 scores out of 100 on the Metacritic movie websitehttp://www.metacritic.com/movie/starless-dreams/trailers/8128026 Scott Tobias of Variety said, \\"Oskouei is given a window into homes where, as one subject puts it, \\"pain drips from the walls,\\" but \\"Starless Dreams\\" isn't a cavalcade of misery. With confinement comes safety, and with a roomful of like-aged girls from common backgrounds, the rare opportunity for friendship and fun.\\" Leigh Kolb of Bitch Media said, \\"Oskouei's style as a documentarian would seem invasive if it weren't so empathetic. His voice is present and strong, and he asks the girls probing questions: about their crimes, about their histories, and about their hopes.\\" Stephen Holden from The New York Times said, \\"Roger Ebert once called the movies 'a machine that generates empathy,' and Starless Dreams ... is just such a machine. With the conceptual rigor and emotional directness associated with the best of Iranian cinema Oskouei simply listens to the stories of those who have never been listened to before.\\" Deborah Young from The Hollywood Reporter said, \\"Mehrdad Oskouei's reputation as one of Iran's finest documentary filmmakers grows film by film. Starless Dreams is the perfect example of how powerful simplicity can be, when it's underpinned by compassion for its subject.\\" Kenigsperg from The New York Times said, \\"Although the movie bears some resemblance to the films made by Frederick Wiseman within institutions, the acknowledged presence of the director, Mehrdad Oskouei, creates a constant tension. The girls ‚Äî identified by first names or nicknames like 'Nobody' and '651' ‚Äî show varying degrees of comfort with Mr. Oskouei's questions, some matter-of-factly discussing drugs or stabbings, and others seemingly reluctant to look toward the camera. Yet 'Starless Dreams' suggests that the center's grounds, where the girls play in the snow or work in a greenhouse, are kinder than the world outside, and that release is a fraught prospect. So if 'Starless Dreams' inspires conflicted feelings in viewers, it may be by design. It's hard not to want to flee, and it's hard to look away.\\" Kenji Fujishima from KINO SCOPE said, In some ways, Starless Dreams is a standard talking-heads documentary, with much of it made up of Oskouei‚Äôs interviews with the girls in the detention center as learns their histories and how they feel about their lives. But he also alternates these intimate chats with more Frederick Wiseman-esque observational segments of the girls playing and interacting with authority figures and relatives. These fly-on-the-wall scenes help transcend the grim nature of the film‚Äôs subject, showing how capable these troubled girls still are of experiencing childlike wonder.http://kinoscope.org/2017/01/20/starless-dreams-the- passionate-humanism-of-mehrad-oskouei/  References External links * * Category:Iranian films ","title":"Starless Dreams"},{"id":"49215526","text":"Winameg is an unincorporated community in Fulton County, in the U.S. state of Ohio.

Kashmiri papier-m√¢ch√© is a handicraft of Kashmir that was brought by Muslims saint Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani from Persia in the 14th century to medieval India. It is based primarily on paper pulp, and is a richly decorated, colourful artifact; generally in the form of vases, bowls, or cups (with and without metal rims), boxes, trays, bases of lamps, and many other small objects. These are made in homes, and workshops, in Srinagar, and other parts of the Kashmir Valley, and are marketed primarily within India, although there is a significant international market. The product is protected under the Geographic Indication Act 1999 of Government of India, and was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 under the title \\"Kashmir Paper Machie\\". Etymology Papier-m√¢ch√© is the French word for \\"chewed paper\\", which is a standard English loan word, for objects made by moulding paper pulp in various shapes. Then decorating them with designs in various colours. In the figurative sense the word 'papier- m√¢ch√©' has come to be identified as the art of Kashmir. History Madin Sahib Mosque The papier-m√¢ch√© technique of using paper pulp for making decorative objects was first adopted in Kashmir in the 15th century by King Zain-ul-Abidin. Mir Sayyed Ali Hamdani, a Sufi mystic, came to Kashmir during the late 14th century along with his followers, many of whom were craftsmen. These craftsmen used hand-made paper pulp from Iran, Central Asia. It is also said that the prince had been imprisoned in Samarkand in Central-Asia for many years. The leader of craftsmen, Mir Syed Ali Hamdani, a Sufi mystic, also known as Shah-i-Hamdan, was also instrumental on converting people in Kashmir to Islam. These artists who were also well-versed in other handicrafts such as woodcarving, copper engraving and carpet weaving made Kashmir their permanent home. They settled here along with their families. Earlier to this period the practice was to draw colourful paintings on wood on household furniture such as ceilings, bedsteads, doors and windows, palanquins and so forth. Internally this art form was called, kar-i-qulamdan as it was made as pen holders and a few other personal trinkets. Another term used for the art was kar-i-munaqqash as it was crafted on smoothly finished surfaces created using paper pulp or on layers of polished paper. Even treated and stretched skin was used for the purpose. Starting with decorating jackets of books, the art covered many items of that period such as tables, table ware, bangles, lamp stands, cups, plaques, panels, screens and cabinets. During the Mughal era, its use was extended to include many items of home furniture that were made in Kashmir. Many notable objects of this type are exhibited in museums in many parts of the world. The basic method followed was to apply the papier-m√¢ch√© on wood work, and one such work can be seen in Kashmir at the Madin Sahib Mosque built in 1444, the ceiling of the Shah Hamdan Mosque and the Shalimar Garden, a Mughal garden in Srinagar. This tradition of using papier-m√¢ch√© or pulp on wood work to be colourfully painted with different designs is very much in practice even today. Some of the older designs involved intricate painting of kingfishers, maple leaves and other designs, such as \\"Arabesque\\", \\"Yarkand\\" and \\"Hazara\\". To encourage this art form to proliferate, the Government of Kashmir has included papier-m√¢ch√© as a curriculum subject in schools. Manufacturing process The skilled artisans involved with this painstaking process are called sakhta makers. The materials involved with this process are discarded paper, cloth, straw of rice plant, copper sulfate, which are mixed and made into a pulp. The paper, after immersing in water for 4-5 weeks, is taken out and made into a pulp and dried. The dried paper is then converted to a powder. There is also a practice to mix the powdered paper with rice water to facilitate coagulation. The pulp thus made is applied on molds made in wood or brass. In earlier times, the mold was made of clay by the craftsman himself. It is also said that paper was just softened and not pulped and then applied in layers over the mold and drying it after covering each layer of pulp to get the desired shape. At the wet stage of application, the layers were covered with a muslin cloth and overlaid with another layer of material similar to plaster of Paris, locally known as gutchi. The present practice is, however, to complete the layering of pulp over the mold at one stage itself and then dry it before polishing it with gemstones. The artwork is then detached from the mold using a saw and then rejoined using dense glue. The joint is then rubbed slowly with a file made of wood known locally as kathwa. The surface is polished till all irregularities and edges become smooth. Then gold and silver foils are used in combination with the paste of chalk and glue mixture, which is applied to the exterior and interior surfaces of the object using a brush. After drying of the treated object, the surfaces are again polished using baked brick pieces. To prevent any cracking more paper strips are pasted and then polished again to smooth the surface, to get the colour of zamin or earth or of gold, white, black, blue or red. The surface of the object is demarcated with yellow colour, which is then followed by floral designs made in different colours in dark or light shades with application of adhesive compound called dor made of zarda, sugar and glue as adhesive, and applying gold or silver foils. The art object is then dried and given a varnish coat made of amber locally called kahruba or copal (sandirus) in a solution of methyl spirit. It is then sun dried. Following this process of drying the surface of the art object is cleaned thoroughly with a wet cloth. Then the surface of the artwork is again treated with a coat of silver and gold foils and then designs are created over the surface followed by a smoothing of the surface using gemstones such as jade (yashm). Then the art piece is again sun-dried and made ready for painting. Distemper colours made with pigments and glue are used to paint the artwork with various designs. The brushes used for the painting are made of hair of goat, cat or donkey. The practice was to use \\"craft mineral, organic and vegetable colours.\\" Challenges  With new technologies and manufacturing techniques, the art of paper papier-m√¢ch√© is slowly dying. The economic viability of the art, has taken a hit due to machine carving and artisans preferring other jobs. The art and its products most cater to the premier luxury sector with the price range on the upper side. Lower quality, cheaper machine products have given a tough challenge to the sector, with artisans struggling to keep the sector going.

It is the process of evaluating the effect of a person's appearance on their professional image. Image consultants are usually experts in marketing and fashion; they train their clients to improve their image for social events or to achieve certain goals. Not only individuals but also companies can be clients of image consultants, although main clients remain executives and politicians. An image consultant's main focus is on dressing, personal style, clothes buying, body language, and etiquette, taking a customer through a process of evaluating their lifestyle and helping them change their body language and attire in order to help improve their image. The term originated in the seventies. John T. Molloy published the book Dress for Success in the United States in 1975. This book focused on how dressing and personal image affect achieving personal and professional goals. The book was not based on the author's opinion, but on tests conducted on subjects and helped spread the \\"power dressing\\" concept. At this time, the public increased its interest in how clothing affects one's goals, and the book was an international success. In the eighties, a few firms started offering image consulting services specifically for events. Eventually, celebrities started hiring them for their everyday styling and life. Rachel Zoe, a fashion stylist and image consultant, became a fashion icon for styling celebrities. The Conselle Institute of Image Management was founded over 40 years ago. In 1990, the Association of Image Consultants International (AICI) was born, with more than 1,300 members today. Today, the concept of power dressing has become a part of work culture, helping establish a market for the field of image consulting. The practice has seen a rise in demand due to customer-centric verticals such as retail, hospitality, and public relations. The term itself has broadened to include etiquette, body language, communication, presentation, and personal branding.

It premiered on FOX on January 26, 2015 and was written by Megan Mostyn-Brown, and directed by Wendey Stanzler. In this episode, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) investigate the murder of a witness in a public homicide. Meanwhile, Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) suffers the consequences of her failed plan against Falcone. The episode was watched by 6.04 million viewers and received generally positive reviews, praising character development but criticizing the pace. Plot Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) is being tortured by Falcone's interrogator, Bob (Michael Eklund). Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) work with narcotics detective Arnold Flass (Dash Mihok) in a public homicide. They interrogate Leon Winkler (Willie C. Carpenter), who witnessed the homicide. While waiting for an interrogation, Winkler is killed with an icepick by an unknown man. Butch (Drew Powell) manages free himself and Mooney from her captors. Gordon interrogates Narcotics Officer Derek Delaware (Niko Nicotera) about his role in the guard duty. He arrests him when he finds drugs in his car, the same type as in the victim's shoe. Essen (Zabryna Guevara) removes Gordon and Bullock from the case. In the file room, Flass mocks a letter Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) wrote for Miss Kringle (Chelsea Spack). She later apologizes to Ed for Flass' behavior. Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) surprises his mother (Carol Kane) with the nightclub and makes her a singer in the club. Gordon visits and asks for a favor from Cobblepot to get information about Flass. After Penguin sends everybody else home, he closes the nightclub and begins to celebrate, when he's surprised by Mooney. She starts to beat him with a baseball bat when Victor Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan) and his henchmen arrive. Butch sacrifices himself so Mooney can escape. Bruce (David Mazouz), having returned from Switzerland, runs into Ivy Pepper (Clare Foley) in the streets. He asks after Selina (Camren Bicondova) and Ivy arranges a meeting for twenty dollars. Selina visits him in Wayne Manor, where she says she lied and doesn't know who killed his parents and tells him to never contact her again. Cobblepot has his henchman extort Delaware by threatening to kill his wife to get information about Flass. The henchman then gives Delaware's confession on tape and the murder weapon to Gordon, and Flass is arrested for the murder of both victims. Later, Bullock reunites with Mooney, who's planning to flee town and lay low. They part with a kiss. Gordon is approached by Delaware to beg Gordon not to harm his family. Gordon sees that the favor Cobblepot gave him now makes him look like he's dirty and someone to be feared.

With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 9.07 million viewers, and a 3.4 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"Welcome Back, Jim Gordon\\" received generally positive reviews. The episode received a rating of 67% with an average score of 6.3 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"'Welcome Back, Jim Gordon' focuses on the growth of Gothams many leading players, making it a colorful, though hectic, episode.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"okay\\" 6.8 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Though there were interesting pieces within 'Welcome Back, Jim Gordon' (Bullock and Fish, Gordon becoming what he hates), there was just too much at work here that we've been through before. I get that the title of the episode is even meant to be tongue-in-cheek, alluding to the fact that Gordon's back and nothing's changed - but seriously, this one had a lot of the same beats we'd seen in the fall episodes. And the Fish torture scenes, which seemed to be building up to a great character moment, went nowhere.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade and wrote, \\"To Gothams credit, 'Welcome Back, Jim Gordon' actually gives the audience a solid payoff, something that was sorely lacking in the conclusion of the Electrocutioner storyline, which boasted a climax as jarring as a glass of cold water to the face‚Äìor your mechanized, chest-strapped device. At the very least, this week's episode takes its case of the week and builds to a climax that's serviceable to the storyline and to the characters within it. That's as nice as I can get though as, once again, Gotham shows a complete lack of vision while failing to make its procedural elements compelling.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"Welcome Back, Jim Gordon"},{"id":"49215698","text":"Daniel Calvo may refer to: * Daniel Calvo G√≥mez, Bolivian politician * Daniel Calvo (volleyball) (born 1980), Bolivian volleyball player * Daniel Calvo (judge), Santiago Court of Appeals judge of the Republic of Chile ","title":"Daniel Calvo"},{"id":"49215704","text":"Going to Tehran: Why the United States Must Come to Terms with the Islamic Republic () is a book by Flynt Leverett, former senior fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington, D.C., and his wife Hillary Mann Leverett. It was first published in 2013. The premise of Going to Tehran is that the United States must develop its relationship with Iran in a similar manner to that of its relationship with China in the early 1970s at the time of Nixon and Kissinger. Authors Flynt Leverett (born March 6, 1958, in Memphis, Tennessee) is a former senior fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington, D.C. and a professor at the Pennsylvania State University School of International Affairs. His wife Hillary Mann Leverett is a visiting scholar at Georgetown University and Peking University, and a senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China. Both authors are former American national security officials.  Context  Going to Tehran is based on an analysis of the \\"Grand strategy of Iran\\" and the role of negotiating with the United States. According to expert opinion in Washington, Iran's nuclear program had to achieve the same situation that existed in Japan, Canada and other threshold nuclear states; there is the capability of reaching nuclear capability but Iran is not allowed.  Reviews  According to The New York Times, the authors of Going to Tehran gave up the idea of realist attitude of American about obviously partisan stance. In this book, the domestic and foreign policy of Iran has been considered as an acceptable view. According to the concluding pages, the issues between Iran and America cannot be resolved by isolating, strangling, bombarding, dislodging or waiting for Iran to fall. The American government must consider the Islamic Republic of Iran a strategic partner and both countries have to reach an agreement on controversial issues. For representing the history of relations between America and Iran, this book has a unilateral view and is a collection of confidential documents from the time of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. At the end of the book, the author state by example how political planes create a negative view of Iran. The basic idea of Going to Tehran is that the United States must developed its relationship with Iran in the same manner it did with the People's Republic of China in the early 1970s at the time of Nixon and Kissinger. Due to the ideas of the authors, the United States is required to come to an agreement with the Islamic Republic, not to safeguarding the interests of Iran but to stabilize its strategic position in the Middle East and to avoid conflict.

Description Mattu Gulla is said to have been grown since 400 years in Matti, with a legend linking its origins to Sri Vadiraja Tirtha of Sode Vadiraja Matha, Udupi. It was cultivated within an area of more than 500 acres between the Udyavar river and Swarna river. Apart from Matti, it is grown in surrounding villages like Pangala, Kopla and Kaipunjal. The land on which it is grown is enriched with fish meal manure. Mattu Gulla is green in colour, unlike the purple brinjals grown in other places.

It has low moisture content and is known for its unique taste. Mattu Gulla is a widely used vegetable in Udupi cuisine especially the sambar. Mattu Gulla obtained the Geographical Indication tag in 2011 for its unusual and unique taste and exclusive location of production.

VisualSim Architect is a commercial version of the Ptolemy II research project at University of California Berkeley. The product was first released in 2003. VisualSim is a graphical tool that can be used for performance trade-off analyses using such metrics as bandwidth utilization, application response time and buffer requirements. It can be used for architectural analysis of algorithms, components, software instructions and hardware/ software partitioning. VisualSim is used by over 50 companies worldwide and a similar number of universities for research projects. A list of the customers is provided on Mirabilis Design website. Ricoh has used VisualSim to architect the next generation network processing system. Honeywell Aerospace has collaborated with University of Puerto Rico and used VisualSim to evaluate standards-based satellite platforms. NASA JPL worked on the Nexus initiative to develop the next generation interface standard. To select the best interface to meet the deterministic timing and maximum power consumption, architects build models of 10 different protocols including PCIe, Gigabit Ethernet and RapidIO to compare the behaviour for the same workload. American University of Sharjah used performance evaluation methodologies to leverage exploration at the architectural level and assist in making early design tradeoffs. In this paper, the professor used the simulation platforms developed using the VisualSim tool to compare the performance of two memory architectures, namely, the Direct Connect architecture of the Opteron, and the Shared Bus of the Xeon multicore processors. Research and development on improving system architectures has been performed in networking, avionics, industrial, semiconductors, and high-performance computing fields. FPGA designers can perform high-speed virtual simulation of large electronic systems using VisualSim. As part of the Xilinx ESL initiative, the company has added support for on-FPGA CPUs. Block Diagram Editor is the primary graphical user interface and is supported with customizable library blocks of hardware, software and communication resources. Graphical viewers can be placed in the model for real-time viewing or saving for offline analysis. VisualSim has taken SystemC modelling into a higher level of abstraction. It also provides automatic template generation and intellectual-property (IP) block importation. And it adds function calls designed to lift SystemC to a \\"macroarchitectural\\" level VisualSim is widely used for Performance Modeling, Architecture Exploration/ Design Space exploration and early power analysis of Avionics, Automotive Electronics, Embedded Systems, High Performance Computing Systems (HPC) and System-on-Chip (SoC). VisualSim simulation models of the proposed systems can be developed at various levels of hierarchy: Conceptual, Functional and Architectural Level Modeling. The conceptual level models can contain a network of systems including Satellites, aircraft and Ground vehicles. VisualSim functional models contain stochastic definitions of electronics, software, networks and workload. Various types of statistical traffic generators and queuing models of the resources are available in the library folder. At architectural level, the hardware and software models have cycle accurate blocks of processors, memory-subsystems, bus protocols and trace files. Software behaviour /application behaviour can be defined using a State Machine, flow diagram, read/write operations and IO activity. The mapping of the application to the system platform is defined in a spreadsheet. Communication architecture between different systems or sub-systems can be defined using VisualSim networking and wireless libraries. Software task arbitration and scheduling can be defined using VisualSim schedulers or the scripting language. The legacy models can be obtained by importing third-party models built in SystemC or C/C++. Algorithms developed using MatLab and Simulink can be used as a part of VisualSim model.  Modeling libraries  VisualSim provides modeling libraries for model-driven systems engineering activities. Libraries are used during the specification to optimize and validate the specification; during the hardware and software development phase to come up with the optimal architecture; and during the product debug and testing phase to match the actual output with a set of expected results. VisualSim at the level of deriving Systems Specifications provides a complete visual inspection of the system operation as a combination of traffic input, behavioral system definition and sink. This solution augments tools such as MatLab/Simulink and UML/SysML by providing very early visibility into the full system operation without getting into the details of the algorithm and code- level implementation. Typical example use cases would be Multimedia SoC with Network-On-Chip, In-Car networks using Ethernet, CAN, LIN and FlexRay, Submarine Inertial systems, etc. VisualSim modeling at the level of Hardware and Software are built after the system specification has been optimized and validated. The design can be refined by adding specific hardware implementation details, logic and cycle-level timing to the VisualSim model. The device can be a board, set of boards, SoC, sub-system or an Intellectual Property (IP). Implementation details can include the processor pipeline, functional cache, accelerators and bus arbiters. These refinements provide cycle-by-cycle and address-level evaluation of the system functionality, performance and power. The libraries are at statistical, functional and cycle- accurate levels of abstraction. As VisualSim libraries are embedded with timing and power details, the same model provides both performance computational results and power measurement values. Libraries can be configured to a specific technology manually or using a text or CSV file. If an architect wants to evaluate system behavior or performance with custom components, then he/she can modify library configurations by changing library parameters. An example of a Robotic Computer vision system model. = Semiconductor libraries = Semiconductor Systems Modeling toolkits generate transaction-level and cycle-accurate models of complex, hardware devices. Using this generator and the associated hardware architecture library, platform architecture can be defined graphically without the need to write C code or create complex spreadsheets of the instruction sets. The virtual platform can be used to select components, optimize component size and speed, and define arbitration algorithms. VisualSim modeling library blocks helps in rapid model construction and early system bottleneck prediction. Using VisualSim Semiconductor modeling libraries designers can reduce the model construction by nearly 80% over SystemC [].

Llu√≠s Masriera i Ros√©s was born in Barcelona in 1872 to the famous painter Josep Masriera, who was also a well-known silversmith and, along with his brother Francesc Masriera, he ran the family jewelry business started by his father, Jos√© Masriera i Vidal. Llu√≠s Masriera started in his family‚Äôs workshop and created pieces with the same aesthetic and precision that the workshop had always been known for; one which highlighted technical perfection but little creativity. Biography In 1889, Masriera went to study at the Academy of Beaux Arts in Geneva where he was taught by the famous enameller, Edward LossierEdward Lossier The geographic positioning afforded him the opportunity to travel to Paris often and frequent the salons. It was in these legendary meetings that Masriera was introduced to the idea of Art Nouveau and the work of Ren√© Lalique. In 1900, at the age of eighteen, Masriera returned to Barcelona and was named the new artistic director of the family workshop and changed the direction and style of the jewelry that was produced. Inspired by Lalique‚Äôs designs, Masriera melted down all the family‚Äôs existing jewelry stock in order to utilize the raw materials to redesign the pieces into his new style/aesthetic: Modernisme. The total inventory overhaul was completed in six months. The new collection debuted on the Saint Thomas day in 1901 and the pieces ‚Äú‚Äôwere immediately successful and sold out in a single week.‚Äô‚Äù Masriera continued to create Modernisme pieces until 1913, when he stated in a famous essay, The Fall of Modernism, that ‚ÄúModernism [was] dead.‚Äù After Art Nouveau had fallen out of favor, Masriera moved on to the Noucentisme school of design which embraced classical, timeless design elements until his death in 1958. His work lives on today under the Bagu√©s-Masriera firm, established in 1985. Today, the store sits on the first floor of a famous example of Modernisme in Barcelona, Casa Amatller on Passeig de Gr√†cia. The firm keeps Masiera's art alive by ‚Äúcontinu[ing] to master the artesian techniques of translucent enamelling and fire enamelling.‚Äù  See also  * Pendant with Saint George, design conserved at Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, in Barcelona  References  Category:People from Barcelona Category:Jewellery designers Category:1872 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Art Nouveau designers ","title":"Llu√≠s Masriera i Ros√©s"},{"id":"49216008","text":"Kazakh Soviet Encyclopedia (, Qazaq Ke≈Ñes Entsƒ±klopedƒ±ƒ±asy) - was a multi purpose Encyclopedia of Kazakhstan, issued in the USSR.

It premiered on FOX on February 2, 2015 and was written by John Stephens, and directed by John Behring. In this episode, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) investigate homicides where the victims are killed with their greatest fear. Meanwhile, Maroni (David Zayas) begins to question his relationship with Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) after a tip. The episode was watched by 5.79 million viewers and received positive reviews with critics commenting on Scarecrow's debut and Julian Sands's disturbing performance. Plot A man (Julian Sands) hangs another man from a building and kills him after dropping him from the building and steals his adrenal gland. While Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) dines with Maroni (David Zayas). Maroni receives a call from Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith), where she tells him Cobblepot works for Falcone (John Doman). Maroni then takes Cobblepot on a road trip. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) finds Selina (Camren Bicondova) in his apartment. She says to him that she lied about the Waynes' murderer and then flees. He visits Bruce (David Mazouz) where Bruce tells him that he relieves Gordon of his promise to find his parent's killers, and that he will investigate the case himself. Cobblepot is taken to a shack in the woods where Maroni reveals the information Mooney gave him. Cobblepot takes Maroni's gun and attempts to shoot him, but the bullets turn out to be blanks. Maroni knocks him unconscious. Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) is suspended after performing an examination on a corpse from another medical examiner. The killer kidnaps a man afraid of pigs but Gordon and Bullock (Donal Logue) find the man in a hideout. Receiving a tip that all of a recent group of victims were related to a phobia support group, Harvey investigates, and unbeknownst to him is introduced to the killer as a group member named \\"Tod\\". During the meeting, Tod lures the group leader away and tries to kill the woman by drowning her (her phobia) but he's stopped by Gordon and Bullock. They manage to save the woman, but \\"Tod\\" escapes. Maroni takes Cobblepot to a car compactor, where he locks him in a car so he will die slowly in the crusher. Cobblepot calls from the car to the man who controls the compactor and threatens to have him killed by Falcone's men if he doesn't shut the compactor down. The car compactor operator stops the machine and flees. Maroni follows the operator, and Oswald escapes in the confusion. Nygma frames the medical examiner by making it look like he stole body parts. Cobblepot is then found by a group of church woman on a bus to Gotham, and accepts an offer of a ride home. Meanwhile, Mooney's boat is captured by a group of mercenaries. The episode ends as Mooney and a mercenary prepare to fight. Reception=Viewers= The episode was watched by 5.79 million viewers, with a 1.9 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 8.59 million viewers, and a 3.2 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"The Fearsome Dr. Crane\\" received positive reviews. The episode received a rating of 88% with an average score of 7.7 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Though similar to previous episodes in form and feel, 'The Fearsome Dr. Crane' introduces a gratifyingly creepy villain while integrating humor and tension.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.6 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"The fearsome Dr. Crane parts of 'The Fearsome Dr. Crane' were actually the weakest parts of the episode, believe it or not. Maroni and Penguin had a great falling out (which Penguin barely escaped alive) and the Gordon/Dr. Thompkins relationship slowed down a bit so that the two of them could actually try to build a rapport outside of his work (though it didn't stray too far). As for that final scene with Fish on the boat? I don't know what that was about. That soldier busted in on her, the two of them shared a knowing glance, and then they leapt at each other like they were about to have an anime fight. I actually chuckled, though I don't expect that's what the scene was meant to evoke.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"That kind of character development, which is admittedly minor, could have been used to bolster the Gerald Crane storyline. On any other show, I‚Äôd hold out hope for the second part of this arc exploring more of the dynamic between Gerald and Jonathan, and also giving us more insight into Bullock‚Äôs sudden crush on Mullen. But Gotham has proven time and again that character insight is an afterthought, that the audience should be satisfied just hearing the Crane name spoken. Next week‚Äôs episode is called ‚ÄúThe Scarecrow‚Äù: what are the odds it amounts to more than just a hollow invocation of a canonical character in order to draw in viewers?\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"The Fearsome Dr. Crane"},{"id":"49216090","text":"Sunandarama Maha Vihara, also known as Maha pansala is located in Southern part of, Sri Lanka. It's situated 65 kilometers north of Colombo, 36 kilometers south of Galle and 200 meters East from Ambalangoda railway station. This sacred place holds a land of nearly 5 acres. Traditionally this \\"Vihara\\" belongs to \\"Vilegoda\\",\\"Nambimulla\\",\\"Maha Ambalangoda\\" and \\"Paniyanduwa\\" which are known as \\"Sathara peruwa\\" (the four states which are benefited by the Vihara).Since early days these states have been provided the support to maintanin the Vihara. Early before this place became a vicar, it's known that \\"Ganninanselaya\\" stayed here. Sunandarama Vihara has been interred in two stories which are known as \\"Maluwa\\". The sermon hall, (\\"Dharmashalawa\\"), monastery (\\"Awasa\\"), saƒ´maƒÅgaeya and alms hall (\\"Dhana shalawa\\") are situated in the lower tier while the \\"Vihara\\",\\"Sacred Bodhi\\" and \\"Statue house\\" are located on the upper. The Sacred Bodhi is a shrine in this Vihara.  History The temple dates back to the 18th century BCE. In 1750, the \\"Bodhi\\" was planted according to a belief. In that time this temple was a residence for nuns. But \\"Sunandarama Maha Vihara\\" systamatically started in 1970. Vilegoda Punnasara thero's moving from Aluthwala Nanadarama shrine was the starting of Sunandarama Vihara shrine. Vilegoda Punnasara thero had eleven clerical students. The statue house is the most ancient building which belongs to \\"Kandyan\\" era. According to artist Manju Sri, the main stone door frame and the right hand side door frame of statue house was created by Thotagamu temple artists. It seems that the present statue is older than the statue house created in 1803. Recumbent statue and the standing statue included in the hall's walls and the ceiling was created by P.N Jakolis who lived in Galle and his two assistant artists. The Bell shaped cairn was created in 1843 .Synagogue was built in 1846 and two storied building was constructed in 1893.The small statue house on the second floor was built in 1886; a marble Buddha statue which is placed in that hall is a gift from Burma  Frescoes (Murals) Frescoes at \\"Sunandarama Vihara\\" The artistic murals in the Sunandharama Vihara are notable examples of ancient Sri Lankan art and crafts. These frescoes are similar to the frescoes at \\"Thotagamu Vihara\\", which were sketched by an artist from \\"Sathara Koralaya\\" (an area consisted of four states of the up country side of Sri Lanka) around 1805. 241x241px These frescoes portray sundry \\"Jathaka Stories\\" (the stories which portray previous birth stories of Lord Buddha) like \\"Vessanthara\\",\\"Sachchankira\\" and \\"Mandhathu\\" \\"jathaka stories\\", including the \\"Vessanthara Jathaka Story\\". Even though hill country tradition is local to the hill country temples‚Äô art work the frescoes here belong to the hill country tradition. Red, brown, black and blue are the main colours used in these murals.  Picturesque arch Front Arch at \\"Sunandarama Vihara\\" The bell arch or the picturesque Pandal is the most significant creation of this \\"Vihara.\\" This is the only concrete arch with this amount of precise carvings in Sri Lanka, and is 30 m high and 18 m wide. Ancient security figures and \\"MakaraThorana\\" (a Pandal with a figure of a dragon) are carved for four stories. For every story six security caves have been created. So this depicts a whole security squad for the \\"Vihara.\\" A mechanical bell has been attached for the third floor and it weighs 250 kg. It works from a machine placed on the first floor. The scared foot print of \\"Lord Buddha\\" is carved on the fourth floor to enhance the dignity and respect towards \\"Lord Buddha\\". The construction was begun in 1876 by Mr. Juanwanwadu Endoris De Silva. Various artists worked on this arch under his guidance. After the death of Endoris De Silva in 1895, his son took his place. However the construction took over 40 years to be completed. To hold the weight of the three storied carvings, the base of the arch was constructed on a railway track with the help of the engineers of railway service. According to the resources, the cost of the construction was borne by local residents. By the time, the arch was dragged for deterioration and a reconstruction committee was organized in 1988 with the help of local dignitaries. This was chaired by Mr. M.S. De Silva and Mr. P.E. Ariyasinghe was the secretary. Mr. Bernard Lokuge, Mr. Santhiyagu Upasiri, Mr. A.M. Karunarathne, Mr. A.M. Somapala De Silva, Mr. Bandu Wijesooriya, Mr. Sirisena Lokuge, Mr. Piyasena Peduruhewa and Mr. J.B.S. De Silva were among the committee members. Since then, its conservation and reconstruction work have been maintained by the locals.  Gehenna Gehenna at \\"Sunandarama Vihara\\" \\"Gehenna\\" also known as \\"hell\\" was another creation in the Vihara.It's situated in the eastern side of the temple complex. It's a alarge concrete creation with basement \\"Lkumbu\\"(strong) hell and various tunnels there. Though its construction began in 1928, it has yet to see completion.  Bodhi Bodhi at \\"Sunandarama Vihara\\" The sacred \\"Bodhi\\" here is known to be one of the eight branches (plants) from the sacred \\"Sri Maha Bodhi\\". This \\"Bodhi\\" is believed to have been planted around 1750, well before the construction of the temple.  Conservation  Though the conservation of this temple complex was initiated in 1988 by the reconstruction committee for the \\"arch\\", the locals are doing their best to conserve this piece of work for the generations to come. Much of the deteriorating frescoes have been subjected to reconstruction.

Plot  The film tells the story of the life of Pope Francis (formerly Jorge Mario Bergoglio), from his youth in Buenos Aires and his experiences under the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla to his appointment as pope in 2013.  Cast  * Rodrigo de la Serna as young Jorge Mario Bergoglio * Sergio Hern√°ndez as older Jorge Mario Bergoglio * Mercedes Mor√°n as Esther Ballestrino * Muriel Santa Ana as Alicia Oliveira * √Älex Brendem√ºhl as Franz Jalics * Maximilian Dirr as Giovane Prete * Andr√©s Gil as Father Pedro * Marco Di Tieri as Quique  Production  Upon seeing Pope Francis's first appearance on the balcony of St. Peter's Square, director Daniele Luchetti began contemplating a film about Pope Francis's life. The film's script was written by Daniele Luchetti and Mart√≠n Salinas. Luchetti has said that he aimed to avoid hagiography in the film, though it presents a generally positive portrayal of the pope. The pope did not provide guidance to the film's production team, despite their attempts to contact him. Monsignor Guillermo Karcher, a close associate of the pope, later stated that the movie was \\"truthful\\". Luchetti joined with producer Pietro Valsecchi and Taodue to produce the movie, which was financed by Mediaset. The film was shot in Italy, Germany, and Argentina over 15 weeks. The film was shot in Spanish with an Argentine, Chilean, and Spanish cast, along with approximately 3,000 extras. The film cost 13 million euros, or approximately 14 million dollars, to produce. The film's soundtrack was composed by Arturo Cardel√∫s. Writer Evangelina Himitian has claimed that the film is an illegal adaptation of her book Francis, the People's Pope (Francisco, el Papa de la gente). In March 2014, producer Pietro Valsecchi acquired an option to adapt the biography for the film; he ultimately did not exercise this option. According to Himitian, the film is nonetheless based on her research and her meetings with the film's production team. Valsecchi has denied Himitian's allegations, saying that the film is based on multiple sources and not simply her biography, and that the 40,000 euro option would have been a trivial component of the film's budget had the film in fact been based on her book. At the time Himitian made her initial allegations, she had not yet seen the film.  Release  The film premiered on December 1, 2015 in the Paul VI Audience Hall, which lies across the border of Vatican City and Rome. The Office of Papal Charities determined the guest list, and all of the 7,000 tickets were distributed to the poor‚Äîincluding refugees and homeless people‚Äîand volunteers who serve them. Bagged dinners were given to attendees after the showing. On December 3, the film opened in 700 theaters across Italy. Pier Silvio Berlusconi, Maria Elena Boschi, Gianni Letta, and other Italian personalities attended the film's official presentation at Rome's The Space theater. Medusa Film managed the film's distribution in Italy; Taodue is managing its distribution elsewhere. The film is expected to be distributed in 40 countries.  Reception  During its opening weekend (December 3‚Äì6, 2015), the film ranked second at the Italian box office (following In the Heart of the Sea) with 1.3 million euros in box office receipts. The same weekend, more spectators attended Chiamatemi Francesco (239,029) than In the Heart of the Sea, but In the Heart of the Sea benefited from premium prices for 3D tickets. As of December 27, 2015, the film had grossed over 3.5 million euros in Italy. The film received generally positive reviews. Chiamatemi Francesco was named Italian Film of the Year at the Capri Hollywood Film Festival.  Miniseries  The film was released in 2017 in the form of a four-part television miniseries, each lasting about 50 minutes.

Although the woman has never been identified, one theory that police are working on is that she was a sex worker known as \\"The Duchess\\" who worked the Great Yarmouth docks under that pseudonym prior to her disappearance in mid-1974.

A collector in the United States identified the cover as being from a payroll machine and the exact model but the enquiry also established that thousands of the machines would have been made with many exported. With her body was a length of rope that was unusual in being made of four strands, rather than the more usual three or five strands. An expert told police that the composition of the rope \\"suggests it was made for use with agricultural machinery\\". Police traced the place of manufacture of the rope to Dundee in Scotland but the firms that made that type of rope have since ceased trading. The first murder enquiry into the death ran from 1974 to 1975 during which time police spoke to 15,000 people and took 700 statements. They completed 6,750 house to house questionnaires. In 2008, Norfolk Police exhumed the woman's body under Operation Monton and took a DNA sample but were unable to identify the woman. They established that she was right-handed, had probably given birth, had consumed water found in Scotland and that fish and crabs formed an important part of her diet. They have issued several appeals for information. In 2008, the case was featured on the BBC's Crimewatch programme. In 2011, police made another appeal and identified 540 missing women as a result of fresh enquiries. In 2016, the case featured on television again and twice in the online version of BBC News. In 2009, police began to examine serial killer Peter Tobin's links to Norfolk, to determine whether he could have been involved in the case, or in any other unsolved murders in the county. Origins After the woman's remains were exhumed in 2008, samples of her toenails, hair and thigh bone were subjected to DNA and isotopic analysis. A full DNA profile of the victim was obtained but there was no match with any database, but the independent isotopic analyses carried out by professor Wolfram Meier-Augenstein and another scientist, which looks at the traces left in the body from the water consumed during a person's lifetime, both indicated that she was probably from the central Europe area including Denmark, Germany, Austria and northern Italy. Family From a second post-mortem examination of the woman, Norfolk police learned that her pelvic girdle had widened which happens during pregnancy to allow a woman to give birth, indicating that she had likely borne at least one child in her lifetime. \\"The Duchess\\" Following a call from a former police officer, after the case featured on Crimewatch in 2008,Headless corpse discovered in Norfolk 40 years ago 'could be sex worker known as \\"the Duchess\\"'.

She had lived for four or five months in the dockers' hut at the Ocean terminal, and is believed to have also spent time in custody, although contemporary records from this era have been destroyed, and thus the police still do not know this woman's real name.

The marchers' aims were to protest the introduction of the Apartheid pass laws for black women in 1952 and the presentation of a petition to the then Prime Minister J.G. Strijdom.  Background  The organisation behind the march was Federation of South African Women, an anti-apartheid organisation for women of various groups including the ANC Women's League with the aim of strengthening female voice in the movement. They contributed to the Congress of the People in 1955, where the Freedom Charter was drawn up, by submitting a document called What Women Demand which addressed needs such as child care provisions, housing, education, equal pay, and equal rights with men in regard to property, marriage and guardianship of children. By 1956 their focus had shifted towards a protest concerning the introduction of passes for black women.  March  The march took place on 9 August 1956 with an estimated 20,000 women of all races descending on Pretoria. The day of the protest was called for on a Thursday, the traditional day when black domestic workers had their day off, with the aim of ensuring a larger gathering of women. As the women arrived by train and other means, they walked to the Union Buildings, the centre of the South African Government, in small groups of twos and threes ‚Äì large groups were banned by the authorities ‚Äì and met at the building's gardens and amphitheatre. Leading the march were Lillian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Albertina Sisulu and Sophia Williams-De Bruyn. A representatives of each race group in South Africa carried 14,000 petitions for presentation to the Prime Minister J.G. Strijdom. The Prime Minister was not available, being elsewhere so as not to accept the petition from a multicultural group of women, so in his place it was accepted by his Secretary. They then stood for thirty minutes in silence before singing \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\" and then sang a woman's freedom song called \\"Wathint' abafazi, Strijdom!\\"  Petition  The petition had been created by the Federation of South African Women and printed by the Indian Youth Congress. The petition reads:  Monument to the event  On 9 August 2000, National Women's Day, a monument was unveiled at the Malibongwe Embokodweni, the amphitheatre at Union Buildings in Pretoria to celebrate and commemorate the event of 1956. It is called the Monument to the Women of South Africa, a project developed by the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology (DACST). A Monument Steering Committee was formed in 1999 with a judging panel established consisting of a veteran of the march, a member of the presidents office, three artists, a designer and a curator. A seven-day workshop at the Technikon Pretoria was held to enable the event to be fair and transparent and allow disadvantaged artists to participate in the competition. Sixty entries were received with the winners being Wilma Cruise and Marcus Holmes. The final design for the monument starts on the steps of the amphitheatre with the keywords of the petition inscribed in metal on the risers. Climbing the stairs, you trigger a sound message in eleven official languages, \\"you strike the woman, you strike the rock\\". When you reach the vestibule, there in the centre lies a imbokodo, a small grinding stone atop a larger grinding stone. The stones sit atop a polished circular bronze stone surrounded by a darker bronze octagon plate. The stones symbolise the women's labour and nurturance while the bronze plates the earth and stone they sit upon.

By May, 1854, Great Indian Peninsula Railway's Bombay-Thane line was extended to Kalyan. Bhusawal railway station was set up in 1860, and in 1867 the GIPR branch line was extended to Nagpur. Before establishment of Sevagram railway station, north‚Äìsouth-bound trains had to get their engines reversed in opposite direction, which was a very time-consuming process. To avoid this problem, a new station for halting north‚Äìsouth-bound trains was established in 1985, named Sevagram railway station. Since then, trains running on New Delhi‚ÄìChennai main line halt at Sevagram railway station, bypassing Wardha railway station. The railways in the Badnera‚ÄìWardha sector were electrified in 1990‚Äì1991. The station has been equipped with new Route Relay Interlocking (RRI) for faster train operation.

He was part of the successful 2009 expedition that retraced Ernest Shackleton's footsteps in the Antarctic. Worsley died in 2016 while attempting to complete the first solo and unaided crossing of the Antarctic. Attempting to be the first person to cross Antarctica on foot, unassisted and unsupported, he crossed more than 900 miles (1450 km) and was forced, by exhaustion and ill health, to call for help 126 miles (200 km) from his journey's intended end. Rescued and flown to a hospital in Punta Arenas, in the Patagonia region of southern Chile, he was given a diagnosis of peritonitis, and died. He was 55. Early life and education Henry Worsley was born on 4 October 1960 at the Garrett Anderson Maternity Home in Belsize Grove, London.The Times 5 October 1960, p.1 He was the only son of General Sir Richard Worsley GCB OBE (1923‚Äì2013) and his first wife, Sarah Anne \\"Sally\\", eldest daughter of Brigadier J. A. H. Mitchell, of the British Embassy, Paris.The Times 7 May 1959, p.14 It has been stated, without clear evidence, that he was distantly related to Frank Worsley, the captain of explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, the Endurance.

With 450 employees and around 4000 volunteers (as of 2014), the group maintains a strong presence in Jordan's poorest communities through a network of 51 community centres. JOHUD's work is primarily concerned with poverty reduction, women's rights, creating opportunities for young people, and defending human rights.  History  The Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development was first created in 1977 by royal decree. Originally named the Queen Alia Fund, the group was created with a broad mandate and substantial levels of official support; the Board of Trustees was made up largely of high-level government officials and was chaired by the Crown Princess, HRH Princess Basma bint Talal. In 1979, the fund was granted special legal status as a non-governmental institution with the right to enjoy a degree of administrative and financial independence. The fund's early years were dominated by research and policymaking, with limited projects that distributed gifts, in-kind assistance and humanitarian aid to impoverished communities. In 1984, the Fund created its first Community Development Centres in Madaba (a form of community engagement that would become the hallmark of the group). QAF CDCs began springing up throughout the country during the 1980s, delivering aid and services to communities that were otherwise on the periphery of society. Throughout this period, the Fund also began creating Jordan's first women's committees, as a means of allowing rural women to take more decisive political roles in local communities. In this period, the community centres also began hosting the country's first kindergartens. In 1989, the Fund created a new organisation under its umbrella: the Queen Zein al Sharaf Institute for Development (ZENID). The new organisation aimed to share and diffuse the development expertise that the Fund had collected via training sessions and publications. In 1991, the Fund introduced the new National Philanthropy Campaign (later renamed the Goodwill Campaign), which began delivering organised humanitarian aid, medical aid and other donations to impoverished communities throughout Jordan. As international development thought gravitated toward sustainable models, the Fund also began investing in new microcredit schemes from 1996. The Small Business Development Centre (now named the Small Business Unit) eventually became the first group in Jordan to offer Islamic microcredit, a novel means of offering credit in a way that conforms with the Islamic prohibition on charging interest. In 2002, JOHUD created another sub-organisation dedicated to the rights of young people. The Princess Basma Youth Resource Centre (PBYRC) is now the group's busiest programme leader, and its success has seen the group shift its priorities toward combating the structural issue of youth unemployment and poor civic engagement. Now holding the view that youth unemployment and marginalisation is the greatest barrier to development in Jordan, JOHUD has officially declared youth issues to be one of the group's biggest priorities, alongside its traditional focus on poverty and women's rights.  Sub-Organisations and Programmes  JOHUD is the largest development NGO of its kind in Jordan, and has created a number of organisations and initiatives under its umbrella. = The Community Development Centre Network = Since the 1980s, JOHUD has been able to provide services for remote and underserved communities via a unique network of 51 community centres in 11 out of Jordan's 12 governorates. The community centres (locally called Princess Basma Centres) typically provide training and awareness sessions, income projects for women, community committees, and aid for impoverished families. The network also relies largely on the work of volunteers, with thousands offering their expertise in ICT, English language training, disability care, and many other field. = The Princess Basma Youth Resource Centre (PBYRC) = The PBYRC was created in 2002 to create youth programmes for Jordan's substantial unemployed or marginalised youth populations. The group has so far created Radio Farah al Nas (a community radio station that focuses on women's rights, youth issues, and providing helpful information for refugees), three employability centres, three ICT clubhouses, debate clubs, film clubs, science labs, and other miscellaneous programmes that teach life and work skills. The busy centre works exclusively with young 10-24 year old Jordanians from a range of backgrounds. = Goodwill Campaign = The Goodwill Campaign was created in 1991 to share humanitarian and medical aid with impoverished communities in Jordan. The campaign runs a number of events throughout the country every year, typically providing free medical days, financial funding for scholarships, or toys, winter items, food, and other forms of in-kind assistance. Along with providing more immediate assistance, JOHUD also runs separate projects that tackle the source of poverty in Jordan; the Pockets of Poverty programme specifically tackles the extreme poverty found in the poorest areas through microcredit loans, infrastructure repair, and business skills classes. = Natural Resource Management Programme = A number of JOHUD projects under the NRM label aim to help Jordan overcome its structural water scarcity issues. The programmes have so far helped tens of thousands of Jordanians in water-scarce areas by repairing aging infrastructure, training local women on how to fix home piping, and donating new water tanks. = Al-Rajaa School and al-Mutah Special Education Centre = JOHUD has created some of Jordan's first and only education centres for disabled people. Al-Rajaa School for the Deaf was created in 1983 to provide a specialised curriculum for deaf students in which alternatives to sign language could be promoted (helping students to rejoin the wider community). Al-Mutah Special Education Centre in Karak is also geared toward helping disabled people engage more broadly in the community, offering lessons teaching work skills to disabled adults or social skills lessons for those with autism or other mental issues. = The Queen Zein al- Sharaf Institute for Development (ZENID) = The ZENID centre was created in 1989 to serve as a regional hub for development knowledge sharing. Today, ZENID conducts regular research projects, offers regular training sessions to community groups and partners, maintains a library of development knowledge and records, and hosts major regional conferences. The ZENID complex also hosts the PBYRC, Radio Farah al Nas, and JOHUD's ICT clubhouse in Amman. = Small Business Unit = Previously called the Small Business Development Centre, the Small Business Unit provides microcredit loans for the entrepreneurial poor throughout Jordan. Those looking for a small loan with which to start up a business are invited to apply, and all finance is provided in accordance with Islamic law (thus encouraging devout Muslims who would otherwise avoid banks to seek the capital necessary to launch their ideas). = Queen Alia Competition = The Queen Alia competition is an annual competition that has been held since 1995. It aims to raise awareness of prominent issues (like national development, water, health, the environment, and others) by distributing a questionnaire to schools and community centres throughout the country. Participants are invited to research the subject at hand and submit their answers to the competition, for prizes up to 2000 Jordanian Dinars in value. A sub-competition, the Jo-Green Competition, also invites engineering students to submit eco-friendly architectural plans for buildings. The competitions are significantly well known in Jordan, attracting approximately 650,000 entries per year.  Philosophy  On its official website, JOHUD states that its overall aim is to create a society in which all Jordanians have: * The right to a stable livelihood that provides individuals and their families with the quality of life they deserve * The right to a secure living environment, free from the dangers associated with poverty- related social vulnerability * The right to personal agency, meaning that all Jordanians have the ability to affect decisions that impact their lives * The right to access the resources needed to ensure self-reliance and social mobility for all.

It lies midway between the villages of Prats-de-Mollo , seat of the parish to which the chapel belongs, and Le Tech, capital of the municipality. According to legend, the chapel was built by a hermit named Guillem, who settled there in the early Middle Ages after defeating evil spirits that had haunted him. The Romanesque construction dates from the 11th century, and was based on a somewhat older building. The chapel is a listed building, as are various objects (including a rare wrought iron bell) associated with it. Two medieval manuscripts addressed to the priests officiating at the church also survive. The hermitage has been a place of welcome and for the rest of travelers for over a thousand years. The site includes a refuge, rebuilt in 2014, for the several hiking trails which pass nearby. Although the chapel has not been home to any hermits since 1840, it still becomes a place of meditation twice a year, during traditional Catalan religious festivities known as aplecs, celebrating St. Guillem and St. Mary Magdalene, to whom the hermitage was originally dedicated.

The chapel belongs to the town of Le Tech, which is accessed by a paved road and then a dirt forest road; or on foot, by various marked hiking trails, the shortest of which measures three kilometers from La Llau, a journey which takes about one hour's walk. The hiking trails of the Vallespir Tour and the Canigou Tour also pass close to the hermitage. These trails are the old roads used by pilgrims coming from Prats-de-Mollo and Montferrer. The entire site is surrounded by Vallespir national forest. The site which includes the Romanesque chapel is near a large housing estate, and a few meters downstream, there are several abandoned buildings and the hiking shelter.

This meant replacing other facilities, such as a gym, a theatre and meeting rooms. In the early 2000s the museum was renamed ‚ÄúThe Jewish Museum of Rome‚Äù in order to emphasise the close relationship between the Jewish Community and the city. A Foundation to support the museum was established and in 2009 this was renamed in honour of the former Chief Rabbi, Elio Toaff. Support for the new museum and its collection was provided by the European Union, the Italian and Lazio governments, and the city of Rome, as well as by private donations, including from Alcatel. Rings on the Scroll of Law in the museum The art collection in the museum has largely been donated by members of the Community. It reflects the long history of Jews in Rome and, in particular, the Ghetto period (1555‚Äì1870) when all Jews from Rome and surrounding areas were forced to live in a small area. The collection includes around 900 liturgical and ceremonial textiles, illuminated parchments, around 100 marble pieces and about 400 pieces of silverwork. Also displayed are some of the many documents held in the Community‚Äôs archives. The exhibition * The Roman era The museum traces the history of the Jews and, in particular, their relationship with Rome. This goes back to the time of Judas Maccabeus who, in the mid-2nd century BCE, petitioned Rome for help in opposing the Hellenistic Kings to restore Jewish worship in Jerusalem. According to tradition the two ambassadors sent to petition the Roman Senate were received by Jews already living in Rome. In 63 BCE, Judea was conquered by Pompey and in 70 CE it was annexed to the Roman Empire by Vespasian and Titus after the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War. This resulted in many Jews coming to Rome, particularly as slaves. During the Imperial period there were said to have been as many as twelve synagogues in the city. Archaeological evidence comes from two Jewish catacombs at Villa Torlonia and Vigna Randanini. The museum displays plaster casts of catacomb tombstones presently held in the National Roman Museum and other museums in Rome. * The Middle Ages From the 4th century CE Jews spread throughout Europe and were often forced to leave areas in which they had settled. In 1492 all Jews were expelled from Spain. Others were expelled from southern Italy, and central and northern Europe. Many refugees made their way to Rome. There was therefore a diversity of Jewish traditions in the city and these are well represented in the museum‚Äôs collection of manuscripts and printed documents as Rome was a noted centre for the production of manuscripts. * The Ghetto Despite implementing many restrictions, Rome is the only city in Europe never to expel Jews.However, by the early 16th century Jews represented about one-thirteenth of Rome‚Äôs population and efforts were made to convert them. As well, copies of the Talmud were burnt. This culminated in 1555 when a Papal Bull established the Ghetto, which continued in existence until 1870. The museum has considerable documentation and illustrations from this period. An interior view of the Spanish Synagogue * Abolition of the Ghetto The museum provides interesting illustrations of changes after Italian Unification in 1870 to the area occupied by the Ghetto, and traces the steps taken to develop the Great Synagogue. Rome‚Äôs was the last European ghetto to be abolished. * Fascism and the German Occupation In 1938, Mussolini and King Victor Emmanuel III, under the influence of Adolf Hitler, signed laws known as the ‚ÄúDefence of the Race‚Äù, which removed all civil rights from Jews in Italy and forced them to leave government posts. A number of newspapers and magazines of the time are exhibited. Subsequently the Jews experienced further persecution, with shops being raided and some people having to undergo forced labour. Following the overthrow of Mussolini and the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the Germans occupied Rome. The Jewish Community was told that it would be left alone if it handed over 50kg of gold. Examples of receipts given to those who contributed, including non-Jews, are on display, together with files held on Jews in the SS Headquarters. The ‚Äúagreement‚Äù was not honoured, however, and on 16 October 1943 the Germans rounded up and deported around 2000 people to concentration camps, few of whom returned. The museum records this, as well as the Ardeatine Massacre when Jews and others were murdered in retaliation for a resistance attack on German troops. * Daily life in the Ghetto Exhibits in this section include coverage of the Jewish home, the kitchen, weddings and celebration of religious holidays. * The five synagogues Many of the exhibits come from the building housing five synagogues (Cinque Scole), that was torn down in 1908. These include curtains, inlays, marble slabs and chandeliers. Other items were preserved in the Spanish Synagogue. Photos of the former synagogues are also displayed. * The gallery of ancient marble This is a collection of marble carvings and engravings from between the 16th and 19th centuries, which contain important documentary evidence of the history of the Jewish Community in Rome. Some refer to legacies left by wealthy families, others record the purchase of cemetery plots. These marble slabs, were an important element in the decoration of the Cinque Scole. * The textiles These were mainly taken from the five synagogues. They include Renaissance velvets and lace of the Baroque period. For the most part they were bought second-hand from Roman nobility and then adapted for use in the synagogues, with the application of embroidery and trimmings.

Born in Cheetham in Manchester, Coppock left school at eleven and followed his father in becoming an apprentice bricklayer two years later. During this period, he also became a member of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). On completing his apprenticeship, he joined the Operative Bricklayers' Society and became an active trade unionist. He served as a full-time branch secretary from 1911, then divisional organiser in 1916. He was also active on the Manchester and Salford Trades Council, and became a magistrate before he was thirty.John Saville, Dictionary of Labour Biography, Vol.III, pp.48-52 Coppock opposed World War I, during which he was active in Independent Labour Party (ILP), through which he became friends with Harry Pollitt. He was elected to Manchester City Council in 1919, serving for two years, and he also stood unsuccessfully to become secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, successor to the Operative Bricklayers, but was beaten by George Hicks. However, in 1920 he was narrowly elected as secretary of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives, which brought together various builders' trade unions. As a result, he moved to London. The federation during his first decade had few successes, and Coppock devoted some of his time to promoting the Building Guilds movement, but in 1934 he was central to forming the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers, and was its first president. In 1925, Coppock was elected to London County Council as an alderman, serving for six years, then in 1934 he was elected to represent Limehouse. He was vice-chairman of the council in 1939/40, and chairman in 1943/44, after which he once more became an alderman, serving until 1965. While on the LCC, he made a major contribution to development of the Green Belt around London, working with James Chuter Ede of the Surrey County Council and others on determining the land to be conservedJ Chuter Ede, unpublished diary, 22 May 1943. He gave one of the orations at Pollitt's funeral in 1960, and retired from his trade union posts in 1961.

JS Bank currently has an asset base of over $4 billion, with a work force of 5000 employees & presence in 180 cities of Pakistan.  Early life and background  Ali Jehangir Siddiqui was born to Jahangir Siddiqui, a Pakistani businessman, and Mahvash Jahangir Siddiqui, an educationist on 5 December 1976 in Karachi, Sindh. At the age of 15 he launched a technology business called Advance Micro Research which integrated computer network systems for corporations. His father, Jahangir Siddiqui, founded Jahangir Siddiqui & Co. Ltd in 1970 which has become an eclectic empire and span to 150 cities today. This later became JS Group, an investment holding company with Rs. 413 billion (US$3.7 billion) in assets as of December 2017. The Group claims to employ more than 20,000 people in Pakistan and has invested in several companies in various sectors. Siddiqui's mother, Mahvash Siddiqui, was an educationist by profession, and has served as a Professor of English Literature and Head of the English Department at Khatoon-e-Pakistan College, Karachi.  Career  Entrepreneurship Siddiqui has been a pioneer in leading several business ventures, a respected counsel and advisor throughout his career. This comes from his work and investment with partners for setting up various businesses, including: * Airblue * Arabian Gulf Steel (a steel producer in the UAE) * Jura Energy (a Canadian oil and gas company with operations in Pakistan) * RAK Ghani Glass (the largest pharmaceutical glass producer in the UAE and GCC countries) * JS Private Equity Management (founder and later Chief Investment Officer) Board Memberships The Global Artificial Intelligence Unicorn, Afiniti International Holdings, revised its advisory board at the start of 2019, appointing Ali Jehangir Siddiqui as the member of Advisory board with Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron joining as Chairman of the Board, Lord John Browne - CEO BP, Andrew Knight ‚Äì Chairman Times Newspapers, Andrea Wong- Director Liberty Media International.

After the floods MJSF established refugee camps accommodating more than 10,000 effected individuals, providing food supplies to over 20,000 people and clean water for over 100,000 people during the 4-month relief operations period. MJSF worked in coordination with the UN agencies and INGOs. Apart from humanitarian services Siddiqui also supports the arts and considers it as important as philanthropy as evident in this quote, \\"Supporting art is as vital as building hospitals and schools as art literally shapes national consciousness and also inspires the nation for economic and social advancement.\\" He served on the board of Acumen, a global social enterprise investment firm, for 9 years.  Public service experience  Ambassador to the US In March 2018, he was appointed as the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and commenced his duties on 29 May 2018. As an Ambassador he managed to handle numerous regular engagements and meetings such as Congressional Outreach Programs, Think-tank meetings, Trade & Economy sittings, Embassy events, and Media as well as academia addressing. Prior to his appointment as the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) claimed that Siddiqui was involved in matters relating to three companies: Azgard, Agritech, and Monte Bello which caused losses to investors and shareholders. Their claim was that he's the director of Azgard which siphoned moneys amounting to ‚Ç¨23.758 million to purchase the company Monte Bello SRL using another company Fairytal SRL Sweden which resulted in loss for shareholders. He also sold shares under Azgard to government institutions at higher market rate in order to compensate for the company's loans. On the contrary, other reports suggested that the allegations from NAB were baseless. These allegations were politically driven because the Azgard and Agritech matters were already sub-judice prior to Siddiqui's appointment and Siddiqui was neither a party nor a respondent in these proceedings. Siddiqui had also left the board of directors of Montebellos parent company 4 years prior to its bankruptcy. The counterclaims, thus, indicate that the allegations in the investigation were an attempt to defame him and impede his appointment as ambassador. Siddiqui's reputation and work was acknowledged by US commentators while it was frequently criticized by Indian media. In June 2018, Siddiqui presented his credentials to US President Donald Trump. In July 2018, Siddiqui met James Mattis, the US Secretary of Defence. The meeting took place at the Pentagon where Siddiqui received a guard of honor on behalf of Pakistan. During celebrations for Pakistan's 71st Anniversary of Independence in August 2018 at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Ambassador Alice Wells, the chief guest at the event, acknowledged Pakistan's sacrifices against terrorism and stated that Sididqui was \\"an important player here\\" and that \\"everyone in town has met you and is talking about the energy you bring to the job.\\" In October 2018, the Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi announced a change in Pakistan's ambassadorial appointments to multiple countries including the United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Serbia, Cuba amongst others. The individuals being changed were appointed during the regime of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Soon after Shahid Khaqan Abbasi became Prime Minister of Pakistan, Siddiqui joined the Government and served as a Special Assistant to the Prime Minister with the status of a Minister of State from August 2017 until May 2018. Ambassador For Foreign Investment On 13 June 2019, Ali Jehangir Siddiqui was appointed as the Ambassador for Foreign Investments in Pakistan in an Honorary Capacity. He played an important role in promoting US-Pakistan partnership and political relationship, who believes that, \\"Over the years, this partnership has shaped other global bilateral interactions as well as regional political developments.\\" Following Trump's tweet which produced negative sentiments against the US among Pakistani public, through Siddiqui's efforts, he has been able to open doors to mutual diplomatic dialogues between Pakistan and the US. Under his tenure due to the efforts of the current government in encouraging foreign and local investments in the country, Hutchison Port Holdings ‚Äì Hong Kong-based port operator‚Äî committed on 15 October 2019 to invest US$240 million in Karachi Port in order to make it a major trading hub. The Pakistani Prime Minister, Imran Khan received the delegation of the group in October 2019, led by their Managing Director, Eric Ip. Many other Pakistani dignitaries attended the meeting, including Minister for Maritime Affairs Syed Ali Haider Zaidi, Advisor to PM on Commerce Abdul Razzaq Dawood, Special Assistant to PM Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Bukhari, Ambassador at Large for Foreign Investment Mr. Ali Jehangir Siddiqui, Chairman Board of Investment Zubair Haider Gilani and other senior officials.  Multilateral engagement  As Special Assistant to the Prime Minister in 2017 and 2018, Siddiqui participated as a member of the Prime Ministers delegations to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings, UN General Assembly, Shanghai Cooperation Organization's Council of Heads of Government Meetings and the World Economic Forum Annual Meetings. He was tasked to lead the Prime Minister‚Äôs agenda at the annual meeting of World Economic Forum 2020 held in January, at Davos.  Personal life  Siddiqui is married to Saira M. Siddiqui, a Bahauddin Zakariya University graduate and a Montessori teacher by profession.  Academic  Siddiqui‚Äôs early education consisted of: * 1995: Karachi Grammar School * 1999: BA Economics, Cornell University * He has also pursued additional educational courses at MIT, the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. Later, he lectured at various institutions, including: * 2012: College of William and Mary in Virginia. * 2013: National School of Public Policy in Lahore. * 2014: National Defence University in Islamabad. * 2018: Entrepreneurship and Management Excellence Center at Institute of Business Management in Karachi. * 2018: School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC * 2019: The University of Oxford  Awards and achievements  Siddiqui was listed by Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue as amongst the top 100 individual taxpayers in Pakistan for the year 2013. He was chosen as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum 2014.  Court Cases  Siddiqui has earlier been called by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) with respect to allegations that one of his companies, Azgard Nine Limited (ANL) had manipulated its stock price resulting in financial losses to investors. Despite passage of several years, no allegations have yet been proved and Ali Siddiqui has based his defence on the premise that he was neither a party nor a respondent to the cases which negates any connection with the same. After the span of 1.5 years, NAB dismissed the case due to inability to establish facts. All allegations were dropped and Siddiqui was cleared by the court of law.

Life Born in 1759 at Currigg in the chapelry of Raughtonhead, Cumberland, he was the fourth son of John Sanderson (1723‚Äì1776), by his wife Sarah Scott of Caldbeck. He was educated first by his father, and then at Sebergham school. A competent classical scholar, Sanderson in 1778 became master at a school at Greystoke, near Penrith. Later he was a private tutor in the neighbourhood of Morpeth, Northumberland. He returned to his mother's house at Sebergham, and lived in complete seclusion, but occasionally met, at a spot overlooking the River Caldew, Josiah Relph, the Cumbrian poet. On his mother's death he resumed work as a schoolmaster, first at Blackhall grammar school, near Carlisle, and then at Beaumont, where, in 1791, he became acquainted with Jonathan Boucher. Sanderson had some success as a poet, and legacies from relatives; he gave up teaching and retired to Kirklinton, nine miles north-east of Carlisle, where he boarded with a farmer, and spent the remainder of his life as a writer. He died on 16 January 1829, when a fire broke out in his room while he was asleep. Some of his manuscripts were lost in the flames. Works Boucher thought well of some verses which Sanderson had contributed a \\"Crito\\" to the Cumberland Packet. He induced Sanderson to contribute an \\"Ode to the Genius of Cumberland\\" to William Hutchinson's History of Cumberland (1794). In 1799 Sanderson wrote a memoir of Josiah Relph, with a pastoral elegy, for an edition of the poet's works. In 1800 he published a volume of Original Poems.‚Äô He published only two poems after 1800, while planning a long one on \\"Benevolence\\". In 1807 Sanderson issued a Companion to the Lakes, a compilation from Thomas Pennant, William Gilpin, and Arthur Young, supplemented by personal knowledge. Cumbrian ballads are given in the appendix. He defended the literary style of David Hume against Gilbert Wakefield, in two essays in the Monthly Magazine, and contributed a memoir of Boucher to the Carlisle Patriot for July 1824. Other friends were Robert Anderson, the Cumbrian ballad-writer, to whose Works (ed. 1820) he contributed an essay on the peasantry of Cumberland, and John Howard, the mathematician. Unlike his friends, Sanderson never wrote in dialect, but his rhymes occasionally showed the influence of local pronunciation. In 1829 appeared Life and Literary Remains of Thomas Sanderson, by J. Lowthian, rector of Sebergham, 1816‚Äì18.

He has also worked as an adviser to the Civic United Front, a liberal party in Tanzania, and as a foreign affairs adviser to the Liberal Democrats in the UK Parliament. He has written for The New York Times, The Guardian and London Review of Books. Rawlence's first book, Radio Congo: Signals of Hope From Africa's Deadliest War (2012), is about how people are living amid war in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2010, whilst working for Human Rights Watch, Rawlence visited the refugee camp complex of Dadaab on the eastern Kenyan border with Somalia, then home to around 300,000 people. In 2011 he returned for the first of seven long visits over four years. Building on his years of research conducted for Human Rights Watch, he interviewed young Somali refugees living there, and saw the camp, which already was the largest refugee settlement in the world, grow further. His resulting book, City of Thorns: Nine Lives in the World's Largest Refugee Camp (2016), alternates between portraits of these residents and \\"big-picture accounts of the regional turmoil that drove them there ... and continues to shape their lives\\". The book received positive reviews in the Los Angeles Times, The Economist, and by one reviewer in The New York Times, His latest book is about the Arctic frontier of the boreal forest, The Treeline, to be published by Jonathan Cape in the UK and St. Martin's Press in the USA, in 2021.

It has been superseded by the Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary (IPSV) but remains available for reference. Development The LGCL was developed by the Local Authority Websites National Project (LAWs), an initiative that aimed to meet the \\"requirement for a structured approach to information handling, publication and navigation\\". The LGCL was created as part of the Information Architecture & Standards project strand, the responsibility for which was delegated to the London Borough of Camden. Version 1.0 was released in October 2003 and version 1.01 in the following month. Version 1.02 was released in January 2004 and officially remains the current full version. Version 1.03 was published in March 2004 but is still considered to be a draft. The LGCL was merged with the Government Category List, and the seamlessUK taxonomy to form the Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary (IPSV) as part of the UK Government e-GMS initiative. The LGCL has since been mapped back to the IPSV as well as having been mapped to the Government Category List and the Local Government Services List (the 'PID List') and the previous APLAWS Category List. The LGCL and mappings are published in XML, PDF and Word formats. LGCL is formally deprecated in favour of the IPSV. Description The LGCL comprises a poly-hierarchy of terms, comprising thirteen broad high-level terms divided into increasingly detailed sub-levels. The top-level terms are: *Business *Community and living *Council, government and democracy *Education and learning *Environment *Health and social care *Housing *Jobs and careers *Legal services *Leisure and culture *Policing and public safety *Social issues *Transport and streets These top- level terms are each divided into two-level terms, some of which may be further sub-divided into as many as four further sub-levels of detail. Thus, for example, \\"Wheelchairs\\" appears as a sixth-level sub-division of Health and social care: *Health and social care **Health and medical care ***Physical disability ****Disability equipment *****Mobility ******Wheelchairs Terms may be repeated at different levels but have consistent meanings, so, for example, \\"Cycling\\" appears as a type of transport route under \\"Transport and streets\\",\\"Cycling, pedestrian and other pathways\\",\\"Cycling\\" as well as an outdoor pursuit under \\"Leisure and culture\\",\\"Sports\\",\\"Types of sports\\", \\"Outdoor pursuits\\", \\"Cycling\\". Synonyms are provided for many of the preferred terms. The standard also includes a commitment that terms will never be removed from the list but may change status or move position in the hierarchy between versions. Use One of the intended uses of the standard was to provide a default local authority Web site navigation hierarchy that could be used flexibly with an appropriate level of detail to meet local requirements. The standard was also recommended for use as the basis of records management system file plans. Availability The LGCL remains freely available \\"without guarantees and without licensing costs\\" and may be used and reproduced free of charge provided specific restrictions and appropriate attribution are respected.

Focussing on children and adult amateur musicians, it runs year round weekend courses, an extensive series of education projects with Somerset schools and a Young Artist programme. It was established in 1993 by Mezzo-soprano Maureen Lehane at her home in Great Elm, a village close to the Somerset town of Frome. The organisation has the aim of bringing Classical music of the highest standard to people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. Founding The organisation emerged from the Great Elm Music Festival, a small series of performances first run in 1987 and then presented annually by Maureen Lehane out of her home in Great Elm. Her desire was to spread education as well as enjoyment of Classical music, which required a building and led to the purchasing of the Great Elm Coach House by local philanthropist Rosemary Bugden. She then let the Coach House to Maureen on a rent of ¬£1 per year to give her a building in which to found the music centre. The Jackdaws Music Education Trust was formally opened by Dame Joan Sutherland on 12 June 1993,Wall (2006), p. 23 in the Coach House beside Maureen's home at Bridge House. The organisation name Jackdaws came from the title of a song for voice and piano by Peter Wishart to words by William Cowper. As the charity was founded by his wife, and dedicatee of the song, Maureen Lehane in his memory, the title seemed appropriate. =Education projects= The Trust is a lead partner in Arts Council England's music education hub for Somerset, Sound Foundation Somerset. Jackdaws work with children in Somerset schools each year through their large-scale education projects, such as OperaPLUS, Year of... and Song Story, as well as smaller projects such as the School Picnic, Summer Production, and community orientated events such as the Big Sing, part of Sound Foundation Somerset's School Singing Strategy. In 2016, the Jackdaws OperaPLUS project won a Music Teacher Magazine Award for Excellence. =Maureen Lehane Vocal Awards= Starting in 1992, the Great Elm Vocal Award was founded in memory of Peter Wishart, a composer of songs for classical voice. Launched to support aspiring young opera singers in their studies, the awards are open to singers between the ages of 22 and 30.

Works Portrait of Black Canon Augustinian nuns Jan van Helmont was a painter of history subjects, genre scenes and portraits. He painted many portraits of prominent personalities of his time including Johannes Jacobus Moretus and his wife Theresia Mechtildis Schilders (1717, Plantin-Moretus Museum), the then owners of the Plantin Moretus printing house in Antwerp. He received regularly commissions from the Antwerp city authorities to paint portraits of historic figures such as Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and to restore the portraits of the 34 sovereigns in the state room of the Antwerp City Hall.

A guardroom scene typically depicts a scene with officers and soldiers engaged in merrymaking. Guardroom scenes often included mercenaries and prostitutes dividing booty, harassing captives or indulging in other forms of reprehensible activities.Review of Jochai Rosen, Soldiers at Leisure, The Guardroom Scene in Dutch Genre Painting of the Golden Age at historians of Netherlandish art The genre became popular in the mid-17th century, particularly in the Dutch Republic. In Flanders there were also a few practitioners of the genre including David Teniers the Younger, Abraham Teniers, Anton Goubau, Cornelis Mahu, Jan Baptist Tijssens the Younger and Jan van Helmont's father Mattheus. Van Helmont's composition depicts soldiers in front of a gate. On the left there is a soldier holding up a flag over a cannon, a pile of weapons, armour and a drum.Mattheus van Helmont, The Liberation of Saint Peter at Colnaghi Old Masters The armour depicted in the picture was already out of date at the time it was painted since metal armours, breast plates and helmets fell out of use from the 1620s.Gillis II van Tilborgh Guardroom scene at Jean Moust It is possible that in line with the moralizing intent of the genre, the armour is a reference to the vanitas motif of the transience of power and fame.Guardroom painting at the Kurpf√§lzisches Museum in Heidelberg ReferencesExternal links Category:1650 births Category:Year of death unknown Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Jan van Helmont (painter)"},{"id":"49217409","text":"This was a new event added to the ITF Women's Circuit in 2016.

It was launched on November 23, 2015, and would serve as a tribute album for the 10th anniversary of the band since its debut in the Philippine rock scenes in November 2005. The album shows a new kind of music style employed by the band, as they wrote songs about love, promises and forevers in a metric style of lyrical writing. Though it was kind of experimental at first, but coupled with the familiar and well-known music and showmanship of the band, the current album is starting to get media hype and positive applause from certified OPM listeners. The band cited the album as the songwriting debut of the band's bassist Aaron Ricafrente. Originally, the first single was \\"Now I'm Dancing\\", which was released before the album was launched, and is the only single not to have a music video, as the band deemed that their second single, entitled \\"Bitter Song\\" was more emotional in lyrics, with a huge hype surrounding the song, so the band decided to pursue it further until its release in early 2016 (they were targeting the younger generations in their second single, hence, it entailed more focus that the first single). The third song released from this album, \\"Is This Love\\", became an instant smash hit, eventually surpassing the short-lived hype of their second single, \\"Bitter Song\\", gaining several air plays across various music stations in the country. It is also the only song of the band, that was released not simultaneously with the music video, as the audio of the song was released in April 2016 and its music video, shot in an ancestral house in General Santos City, was only released 5 months after in September 2016.https://twitter.com/callalilygensaninstagrabbr.com/keanedward/page/21/nojs Track listing # Beautiful ‚Äì 3:12 # Bitter Song (featuring Maysh Baay of Moonstar88) ‚Äì 4:16 # Iintindihin Ko ‚Äì 4:01 # I'm Coming Home ‚Äì 3:56 # Is This Love ‚Äì 4:45 # Nasaan Ka Na ‚Äì 4:35 # Now, I'm Dancing ‚Äì 3:29 # Raise This Cup \\\\- 3:15 # SMB \\\\- 4:25 # Sa'n Ako Magsisimula (also contains another version of \\"Bitter Song\\" as a hidden track) ‚Äì 8:38 References Category:2015 albums Category:Callalily albums ","title":"Greetings From Callalily"},{"id":"49217503","text":"John Butte (fl. 1366), was an English politician.

It commemorates veterans of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and the loss of the USS Maine due to an explosion of unknown cause, which sparked the start of the war. Placed in 1922, it includes the shield and scrolls of the Maine, which were recovered from its wreckage in the harbor of Havana, Cuba. The memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Of several memorials to that war and the loss of the Maine, it is the most elaborate in the state. Description The Battleship Maine Monument stands on the east side of Davenport Park, a city park south of downtown Bangor, near the corner of Main and Cedar Streets. It is approached from Main Street via a path lined by plantings, with benches nearby. The monument is triangular in shape, with sides, and is mounted on a plinth of granite. The monument is composed of blocks of ashlar granite, and is capped by a slightly projecting cornice. The overall effect is that of the prow of a ship. Affixed to the leading edge are the shields and scrolls of the USS Maine. The memorial is topped by a bronze light standard with an eagle at its crown. The plinth has a bronze plaque bearing the following inscription: > To the memory of the soldiers and sailor of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War 1989. > Shield and scrolls recovered from wreckage of USS Maine blown up Havana > Harbor, Cuba February 15, A.D. 1898. Erected by the city of Bangor, A.D. > 1922 History The USS Maine was an armored cruiser of the United States Navy, and was the first US Navy vessel named after the state of Maine. She was sent in January 1898 to Havana, Cuba as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of Americans in the ongoing Cuban War of Independence. On February 15, 1898, an explosion (whose cause continues to be debated) aboard the ship resulted in its rapid sinking, and the loss of three-quarters of its crew. This event greatly heightened tensions that led directly to the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Elements of the ship were recovered during salvage operations in 1912, a number of which now appear in monuments and memorials to the war. Bangor Mayor Flavius O. Beal and Congressman Frank E. Guernsey successfully lobbied for the city's receipt of the ship's shield and scrolls, which were to become the focus of the city's monument. A committee formed in 1917 to identify a location for the memorial selected the Post Office Mall, and design work was commissioned. The work languished until 1920, when a city employee sold the ship relics for scrap. The city recovered most of them, and the act spurred renewed action. A new site in Davenport Park was selected, and the design was produced by Edwin S. Kent, a local architect. The memorial was constructed at a cost of $5,300, and was dedicated on October 17, 1922. Other public memorials to the Maine and the war in the state include one of the ship's cannons at Fort Allen Park in Portland, and a recovered projectile in Lewiston. The USS Maine Mast Memorial is in Arlington National Cemetery, and the principal national memorial to the Maine is the USS Maine National Monument in New York City.

The film narrates the life of Lorenzo da Ponte, Italian Freemason who wouldn't give up his libertinism, despite being ordered to do so as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. When the Holy Inquisition accused da Ponte of having betrayed the Christian faith through his licentiousness and publication of criticisms against the church (influenced by Casanova), condemning him to the exile, his close friend Giacomo Casanova wrote a presentation letter for Antonio Salieri, before da Ponte had to leave Venice for Vienna.

A mother and daughter are haunted by a mysterious evil in 1980s Tehran, during the War of the Cities. The film stars Narges Rashidi, Avin Manshadi, Bobby Naderi, Ray Haratian, and Arash Marandi. Produced by British film company Wigwam Films, the film is an international co-production between Qatar, Jordan, and the United Kingdom. The film premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and has been acquired by US streaming service Netflix. It was selected as the British entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards but it was not nominated. Plot Amidst the terrors of war- torn post-revolutionary Tehran in the 1980s, former medical student Shideh is barred from resuming her studies because of her involvement with student leftist groups. Upon returning home, she gets rid of most of her old medical textbooks, but keeps a book of medical physiology given to her by her deceased mother. As the war between Iran and Iraq intensifies, Shideh elects to stay in the city with her daughter Dorsa despite the protests of her husband Iraj, a doctor who is called into military service and assigned to an area of heavy fighting. Iraj wants Shideh to stay with his parents in a safer part of the country, but Shideh refuses. Dorsa is upset to see her father go, and Iraj promises her that her favorite doll, Kimia, will protect her. A new boy moves in with the neighboring Ebrahimi family, who are his cousins; his parents were killed in an attack. During a shelling, he whispers something into Dorsa's ear and hands her a charm to ward off evil spirits. Dorsa tells Shideh that the boy told her about the legend of the Djinn, and that the charm would protect her, though Shideh throws it away. Shideh visits Mrs. Ebrahimi, who informs her that the boy has been mute ever since the death of his parents. Dorsa develops a fever and has a slew of nightmares, and Shideh is also haunted by bad dreams. Her PTSD grows worse but she is in denial and doesn't recognize being in a state of shock from the psychological stress and trauma of living in a warzone. During another shelling, a missile strikes their building, and an upstairs neighbor dies of a heart attack. Kimia goes missing in the commotion, and Dorsa insists that someone took her. Her behavior also becomes more disturbed and erratic; she insists there is a strange presence in the house, and repeatedly tries to get into the upper floor, believing that Kimia is there. The daughter of the deceased neighbor visits Shideh and claims that her father was unaffected by the missile impact but she found him looking terrified, as if he had seen a ghost. The neighbors gradually begin to leave to escape the fighting. Mrs. Ebrahimi warns Shideh that djinns may possess humans, and they will steal a beloved personal item of their victims. The Ebrahimis leave too, until Dorsa and Shideh are the only two inhabitants left in the building. Shideh's nightmares get worse, and her own items start to go missing. Her nightmares escalate to visions involving a floating chador that moves like a ghost. Dorsa admits to seeing the same apparitions, but claims that the ghostly woman in the chador wants to help her find Kimia. Shideh finally wants to leave to go to her husband's parents, but Dorsa refuses to leave until Kimia is found. Shideh receives a call seemingly from Iraj, but the caller begins to berate her for being a poor mother, as the djinn did. Shideh finds a mutilated Kimia, which upsets Dorsa. Shideh repairs Kimia with tape, but when they are about to leave, another air raid siren goes off. Shideh promises Dorsa that they will escape, but while going down to the shelter, she hears Dorsa's screams. She panics, believing that the Dorsa she left with is another apparition, and returns home to find Dorsa. She sees what appears to be Dorsa under their bed, but when trying to rescue her, she discovers with horror that it is an apparition. Escaping to the shelter, she finds the real Dorsa. The two are attacked by the chador apparition, which separates the two before Shideh manages to find Dorsa. She urges Dorsa back up the stairs but is trapped when the floor begins to suck her down. Dorsa rescues Shideh and the two escape to the car, and Shideh drives them to Iraj's parents. However, it is revealed that Kimia's detached head was left behind and Shideh's medical textbook is still in the djinn's possession, implying they may still be harassed.

The winter of 1944-45 was particularly hard when food and fuel were in short supply and liberation seemed so close and yet so far away There were major events, milestones in the occupation, however between these, life continued as best as it could given the circumstances. It became a matter of survival awaiting liberation. Overall, and considering that at times there were two German soldiers and one Organisation Todt (OT) worker for every five civilians in the very small land area in the islands, there was minimal contact and socialising between the three groups. The bulk of the civilian population kept itself apart, for very good reasons. German soldiers in Jersey  Milestone events  A number of events greatly affected the whole civilian population in the Channel Islands: * June 1940 evacuation of children and adults to the UK * 28 June 1940 bombing of islands by Luftwaffe * July 1940 German troops arrive and occupation starts * Winter 1941-42 when the islands were inundated with soldiers and construction workers * September 1942 and February 1943 deportations of civilians to Germany * October 1943 Funeral of sailors from HMS Charybdis and HMS Limbourne particularly in Guernsey * 6 June 1944 Normandy landings * 27 December 1944 SS Vega bringing Red Cross parcels * 9 May 1945 Liberation  Evacuation  A number of civilians, mainly men, had left the islands in the winter of 1939-40 to join the armed forces. With the invasion of Belgium in May 1940 a few people decided to leave the islands using their own resources. In June, there was a fear the trickle would become a flood. Arrangements were made by the UK and island governments to provide shipping and recommendations to evacuate Guernsey children were issued at short notice, this resulted in most school children leaving, teachers were ordered to leave with them, however parents were initially not normally permitted to travel with them unless there was a child under school age. In Jersey no order was given for schools to be evacuated. Evacuation was then opened up for other people, but with the shortage of shipping and to avoid panic, people were recommended to \\"stay put\\". Confusion reigned, with all but a handful leaving Alderney, very few leaving Sark, only 6,600 leaving Jersey and 17,000 departing Guernsey (see Guernsey Evacuees book by Gillian Mawson). Some ships sailed from Jersey empty. Orders of the Commandant of the German Forces in Occupation of the Island of Jersey, 2 July 1940 The decision to leave or stay was personal. Reasons for leaving ranged from noble (to join the fight), to fearful. Reasons for staying included defiance (not willing to be intimidated), age (too old to move), money (not wanting to abandon businesses or houses), caring (not wanting to abandon elderly parents or pets), duty (civil servants and other essential workers were asked not to leave). Some literally missed the boat. King George VI sent a message of hope to the Bailiffs of each Island, with the request it be read out to the people. Everyone who stayed, 41,101 on Jersey, 24,429 on Guernsey 470 on Sark and on Alderney there was just 18, became trapped for almost five years in the islands.  Working with the German occupiers  The governments of the islands enacted emergency legislation to manage the crisis and when the occupiers arrived, had to come to arrangements to reduce the impact of the occupation on the civilians under their care. Businesses had to conform to the changing rules and regulations including how to deal with a German customer, or suffer reprisals. Individuals generally tried to avoid contact. On arrival in the islands, the Germans issued proclamations imposing new laws on the resident islanders. As time progressed, additional laws restricting rights were posted and had to be obeyed. The restrictions included: Confiscation of: * weapons (1940) * boats (1940) * radios (1940) then (1942) * motor vehicles (forced sale) (1940) * photographic equipment (1942) * fuel * houses * furniture Restrictions on: * fishing (1940) * drinking spirits (1940) * exporting goods (1940) * changing prices of goods (1940) * patriotic songs and signs (1940) * clubs and associations (1940) * wearing quasi uniforms (1940) * taking photographs in open-air (1940) * more than three people meeting together (1940) * access to beaches * fuel * freedom of speech * access to medicines Changes to: * clocks to German time (1940) * drive on right of roads (1941) * rations (1943, 44 & 45 ) Forced to accept: * censorship (1940) * curfew (1940) * exchange rate to Reichsmarks (1940) * census (1940) * food rationing (1940) * increase in income tax to 4/- (1940) * identity cards (1941) * Cycling in single file (1941) * growing vegetables * lodgers billeted * German language in schools * work from Germans * calling Germans \\"our garrison\\" rather than \\"Jerries\\" * carrying an identity card Anyone unfortunate to be caught and sent to prison may have to wait until space became available. Short sentences were served in the islands, which was bad, with rations roughly half those for civilians, however if sent away to prison, it was worse and the risk of dying increased. As the war progressed, prisoners sentenced for possession of radios were released early to reduce the demand on German supplied food rations. Assemblies in churches and chapels were permitted and prayers for the British royal family and the welfare of the British empire could be said although nothing could be said against the honour or interests of the German government or forces. German soldiers were free to attend services. Open air meetings were banned as were the Salvation Army, the Freemasons, the Oddfellows Society and the Ex-Servicemen's clubs. La Soci√©te Guernesaise and La Soci√©te Jersisise were permitted to continue holding meetings. Resistance took place with little success; amongst the notable events was feeding and hiding a few OT workers but at the cost of a number of civilians being imprisoned and the death of Louisa Gould in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp.  Morale and Morals = Morale = Every individual had personal highs and lows to morale throughout the occupation caused by family and close friend difficulties and tragedies. There were few positive personal events. The level of morale affecting the bulk of civilians were affected by island, national and international events. The discovery that locals could converse almost safely in Patois raised morale. At no time did the islanders' allegiance to the British Crown falter. Early in the war at a large German parade the Commandant asked the watching civilians to raise their left hand if they were French citizens, very few raised an arm, he then asked people to raise their right arm if they were British. A photograph was taken and published with a caption stating islanders were saluting Hitler and shouting Sieg Heil, a simple trick. Civilian morale in July 1940 was low, after having almost all the children removed from the islands, then being occupied by German soldiers. Over the next two months islanders listened to Britain fighting what would be named the Battle of Britain and watched German planes flying from the islands, some coming back damaged. The fact that there was no invasion of Britain in 1940 raised morale and life under occupation settled down into a routine that was liveable, with the occupiers being polite and professional. A few papers providing news were dropped by the RAF in late 1940. News from England for Channel Islands Morale fell in November 1940 when radios were confiscated to be replaced with joy at Christmas on their return. Attempts in 1941 at defiance using the V sign were closed down after a few weeks by German fines, threats and imprisonment of offenders. In June 1941 the invasion of the Soviet Union showed that Britain was no longer a target but Germany was very strong. The Red Cross message system that started in 1941 lifted morale. Keeping up with the international news, the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 bringing the USA into the war was a massive boost. The building of fortifications in the islands starting in the winter of 1941/2 indicating Germany was going on the defensive. During 1942 the German armies advanced on all fronts, as did the Japanese in the far east, with small American forces landing in North Africa in May the confiscation of radios in June 1942.and then in September, the forced deportation of mainly British born civilians to Germany resulted in a number of suicides, indicating fear of the future and very low morale. It also gave an opportunity to show defiance, with some individuals in Jersey involved in fights and singing, resulting in tough imprisonment sentences to put fear into potential future offenders. The Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 followed by the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943 left islanders with a hope that the occupation would not last for ever. The funeral for HMS Charybdis and HMS Limbourne sailors in Guernsey in October 1943 gave an unexpected opportunity to show solidarity and defiance, 5,000 people, laying 900 wreaths, turned up for the funeral, boosting island morale and worried the Germans. An opening of a second front in Europe was expected by the Germans and islanders. When it came on 6 June 1944 the joy and expectation of a swift liberation were slowly shattered when it became clear that the islands would be ignored. The isolation of the islands turned to fear, fuel and food supplies had been cut and there was the prospect of a long cold winter. German morale went into free fall. The rumours of help from the Red Cross proved true when the SS Vega (1913) docked with a cargo of parcels in Guernsey on 27 December 1944, before moving on to Jersey. Morale grew by the week in 1945, despite the suffering, as it became clear Germany would soon collapse. Open signs of defiance began to emerge, with Germans not retaliating. Their own level of morale was now very low. The news of the death of Hitler reduced the risk that the Germans would fight to the last bullet. Many listened openly on radios at 3pm on 8 May to the speech by Churchill when he mentioned \\"our dear Channel Islands are also to be freed today\\". On 9 May 1945 morale went off the scale when the islands were actually liberated and British Tommies came ashore. German morale was given a boost in March 1945 following Kommando-Unternehmen Granville, the successful raid on Granville from Jersey. There were suicides during the war despair tipping men, rather than women, over the edge. Civilians, OT workers and Germans were affected. Civilian suicides were recorded as linked to the fear of the occupation, a Jew and several over deportation fears. A number of soldiers, both officers and men committed suicide to avoid transfer to the eastern front, after hearing of family losses from bombing Germany and others in May 1945 on hearing of the death of Hitler. In addition there would be a number of elderly people who died having just given up the will to live. However for most, when at a depressing low, something always occurred to raise morale, even if it was only a rumour. = Morals = German soldiers were well behaved and polite at the start of the occupation. When these soldiers were transferred away, second grade soldiers arrived and were kept under reasonable control by their officers however when these went off the islands received many eastern Soviet soldiers who had volunteered to fight for Germany, they were badly treated and fed and levels of theft and criminal activity rose. A total of around 4,000 islanders were sentenced for breaking laws during the occupation (around 2,600 in Jersey and 1,400 in Guernsey); 570 prisoners were sent to continental prisons and camps, and at least 22 persons from Jersey and 9 from Guernsey did not return. It may seem a high level of crime, but equates to 12 people per 1,000, per annum, similar to the 2010-2014 conviction rates in England and Wales. If you exclude crimes against Germans and conviction of offences that had not existed in 1939, such as breaking curfew, it indicates a level of general good behaviour. The severe penalties imposed by Courts no doubt had had an effect on the level of crime, fines could be as high as several years pay or even the value of a house. Despite people becoming more desperate as the occupation progressed. Friendships between occupiers or OT workers and occupied led to some women earning reputations as \\"Jerry Bags\\". A few were love matches that resulted in marriage. Men and women were accused of collaboration. The worst fall in morals, which even some Germans found distasteful, was the informing on neighbours for breaking the law, such as having a radio. OT workers, which included volunteer workers who were allowed great freedom and were well paid, down to starving \\"slave\\" workers. All categories committed many minor crimes, were involved in black market activities and more commonly in the theft of food. There was a moral aspect of helping a forced worker as against a volunteer worker, the forced worker normally appeared wearing worse clothes and was always hungry and evoked more sympathy and sometimes help. It did not stop OT conmen begging for food and clothes they could then sell. A civilian would see an OT worker being beaten or occasionally killed, such as a man who struck a German soldier, who retaliated by killing the Soviet worker with a spade. Facts like these would quickly circulate, as did rumours of torture, so islanders were all aware of German brutality. Morals within a family could differ, a husband refused to live in the same house as his wife once she got a job washing clothes for the soldiers, irrespective of the money and better rations she would receive. Many acts of Christian charity took place throughout the occupation, people helped look after friends, relatives and neighbours, as well as people in desperate need, irrespective of who they were. There were also many donations to charities, people and companies were very generous. Churches and Chapels were open to all comers, German ministers adopted some churches as Garrison churches, such as St James the Less in St Peter Port, others borrowed churches for military services on a weekly basis, some civilian services were conducted in joint languages of English and German, when attended by the occupiers, a few even included Russian words when Russian OT workers were in the congregation. There were serious crimes committed in the islands that would not have been out of place in the 1930s or 1950s, including murder, rape and assault, however the numbers were not high and the island police worked with the German military police if a soldier was involved, to apprehend and punish culprits. By 1945 morals had fallen due to hunger, it caused a dramatic rise in crimes of theft of food, in the last week of April 1945 there were 235 cases of theft reported to the police in Guernsey.  Property  German troops needed accommodation. The obvious choice was to use the empty hotels however within months the numbers of troops had increased and empty buildings, including schools and houses belonging to people who had evacuated in June 1940 were requisitioned, 2,750 houses in Guernsey, Late in 1941 Hitler took the decision to fortify the islands and in the winter of 1941 and spring tens of thousands of soldiers and 15,000 construction workers arrived, all requiring accommodation. Some huts were built on camps for the OT workers, however many ended up being billeted in private houses that had a spare room. German soldiers and OT workers were billeted in 17,000 private houses in 1942. If a resident had a soldier billeted on them, the island government paid them a few shillings a week, but they were required to do his laundry. One family had a soldier billeted on them and when he admired their young daughter saying that if ordered to do so, he would happily shoot her, they ejected him and he was re-billeted elsewhere. Furniture was requisitioned or just taken and at the end of the war stores full of furniture had to be gone through by people looking for items taken from their houses. Jersey had 185,000 items of furniture looking for owners. A small number of people were ordered out of their houses on short notice when the house was requisitioned, this might be for accommodation or for fortification reasons, which could result in demolition. People had to get used to German soldiers just walking into their houses from the street for a look around or to \\"borrow\\" something. A number of buildings were demolished by the Germans, often to improve lines of sight for guns, or obvious navigation markers, in Guernsey they included the Cobo Inn, the Cobo Institute the Doyle Monument at Jerbourg Point and the James Sausmarez monument at Delancey. The property market continued through the occupation, you could buy or sell a house. In January 1945 there was a high demand for houses in Guernsey and prices rose.  Work  Changes caused by the occupation affected most workers, but especially shop and office workers. Many people had been evacuated leaving vacancies, however many businesses had a dramatic fall in trade, so required less employees. Certain jobs vanished overnight, such as bus and taxi drivers, people in the building trade found that the main employer became the German army. Unemployed people were reduced to charity from their parish officials, so the island governments introduced a work programme before the end of 1940 to give employment to the increasing numbers of unemployed, 2,300 unemployed men in Jersey. This system continued throughout the occupation. Work undertaken included such things as road improvements., cutting timber for fuel and getting water mills working again. Jersey set up Summerland factory which employed 250 people for sorting making and repairing clothes and shoes. Guernsey created a boot factory; even so the waiting list for a pair of shoes could be a year. Employees in businesses undertaking essential services including utilities were required to provide telephone, electric and water services to German buildings, including the new fortifications being built, as well as continuing with their normal work. Civil servants had their pay cut, the governments also established a weekly wage rate of 2 pounds 10 shillings. This was matched with a maximum price that could be charged for almost everything. There were complaints the prices were too low, leading to selling \\"under the counter\\". The German pay rates were ¬£1 a week higher, and attracted workers who could not live on the low wages paid in the civilian sector. The OT offered twice the normal island pay. In Jersey 600 were attracted by the higher wages. In most European countries the Germans demanded workers and took adults away to Germany to work in factories and on the land, this did not happen to Islanders.  Food  The islands had been importing 80% of their food. Despite the reduction in the civilian population following the departure of evacuees up to June 1940, the increasing number of German soldiers and from 1942 OT workers made demands on limited resources. Initially commercial growing provided the bulk of food, with supplements brought in from France. Anyone who had a garden was encouraged to grow their own vegetables. Seeds were obtained from France once local supplies ran out. Many people took to breeding hens and rabbits, however they were always prone to theft and had to be locked up and guarded. Tobacco became very scarce, a pound of tobacco selling in 1945 for ¬£112 (20% of the value of a small house). The Guernsey Tobacco Company made 50 million cigarettes during the occupation. Flour ran out in February 1945, until a supply was brought by the SS Vega. Substitute foods: * Salt ‚Äì seawater * Blancmange ‚Äì carrageen seaweed * Tea ‚Äì blackberry leaves * Tea ‚Äì carrots and sugar beet * Fish cakes ‚Äì limpets and parsnips * Treacle ‚Äì sugar beet syrup * Vegetable ‚Äì stinging nettles * Vegetable ‚Äì broccoli stumps * Coffee ‚Äì acorns \\\\- sugar beet Women generally spent hours a day queuing for what little food was available, sometimes using the waiting time to do knitting, often getting to the front to find nothing was left, then after collecting sticks and water from a well, using ingenuity and time preparing a meal, with the man (and if there were children those also), eating more than their fair share. Scavenging for food, blackberries, nettles and sloes, plants in hedgerows, food for rabbits, gleaning fields after the harvest, became a normal way of life. The number of cats and dogs in the islands reduced as the war progressed, many owned by evacuees having been put down in June 1940. Others died from the lack of food to give them and for the nutritional value they could offer. There was an explosion in the rat population in Guernsey and a reward of half a Reichsmark was offered by the rat destruction committee for every three tails. 9,506 tails were paid for in 1940. Calories for civilians from food controlled by rations amounted to roughly 1,350 per day in the 1941-44 period. The minimum amount is 1,500 for women and 2,000 for men. Rationed calories halved in the winter of 1944/5 making food an obsession, with the poor in the towns having to spend hours queuing for a few cabbage leaves and potato peelings, fainting with hunger, even after the life saving Red Cross parcels started to arrive. = Growing = Commercial growing of tomatoes in Guernsey continued during 1940 to 1943 with tons being shipped out to France on German military shipping. In Jersey the potato crops were grown as in normal years with the food used for exports and local consumption. Seed potatoes for Guernsey were acquired from France. Lack of fertiliser began to show decreases in productivity. The local Vraic was difficult to harvest as access to beaches was restricted. During 1942-3 Jersey lost access to 1,555 acres of arable land, 10% of the total, as they fell within newly fortified areas. = Requisition of food = The obligation of the bailiwicks to pay the cost of the occupation meant that the governments had to pay the food for the soldiers. The Germans requisitioned food that was grown so it was shared between the civilians and soldiers. The proportion was by negotiation but with the Germans holding the control, it would move more in favour of the soldiers as the war progressed, even so the soldiers were close to starving during winter 1944-45. = Fishing = Important industries in the islands, some of the fishing boats had sailed away to England in June 1940. Fishing was banned in September 1940 following an escape. When permitted again, restrictions were put over them, including limiting their access to fuel. Whenever another boat fled the islands, restrictions would increase, with a German guard boat or a soldier often placed on each boat. The fish catch decreased but provided a useful source of calories with Germans taking 20% of all catches. Fish was rationed, a week per household from May 1941. Shore gathering of limpets, winkles and ormers were permitted in certain places at certain times. Rod fishing was also permitted on some beaches, care had to be taken of barbed wire and mines. Limpet pie was quite tasty but required two hours of boiling before being trimmed and then baked with swede in an oven. = Rations = Rationing in line with rationing in England was already operating when the islands were occupied, amendments to suit the food available from France was introduced in August 1940 . The ration supplies were under the orders of the Manche district of France and the islands set up a purchasing commission in the port of Granville to supply what needs could be met from French sources. Tens of thousands of tons of goods were purchased for cash, the goods being freighted to the islands on German shipping. Every type of food, excluding vegetables and fruit, were soon rationed, as were clothing and footwear. Milk was rationed from October 1940 to half a pint per day, the island herds not being slaughtered for meat as milk, butter and cheese was considered more important. Rations were reduced for civilians, until by the end of 1944 they were at a slow starvation level. The level of rations depended on whether you were a German, civilian or heavy manual worker. Prostitutes were graded heavy manual workers. Soap was exhausted in 1941 and substituted with small quantities of poor quality French soap, skin complaints resulted. Babies, children, expectant mothers and invalids received different rations. Cigarettes were initially rationed at 20 per week, German soldiers received that per day. People were allowed to grow tobacco, upon paying a fee, and as the war progressed, tobacco was mixed with other substances to dilute it. In June 1944 a weekly ration in Guernsey stood at: * Bread «Ç * Meat 3 ozs «Ç * Butter 2 ozs «Ç * Fat 1 oz «Ç * Flour 6 ozs * Skimmed milk 3 pints * Potatoes * Suet 1 oz * Sugar 3 ozs * Coffee substitute 3 ozs * Macaroni 1.5 ozs :In Jersey they issued potatoes and 5.5 pints of full milk per week. :«ÇIn February 1945 the first four in the list stopped as stocks had run out. = Red Cross parcels = A few hundred parcels were received in spring 1943 having been forwarded from detainees in Oflag V-B which was located at Biberach an der Ri√ü and Ilag VII in Laufen. The deportees having been treated as POWs received a generous supply of parcels and knowing conditions in the islands, used the German post service to deliver treats to friends and families. Following the August 1944 British refusal to allow the evacuation of civilians from the Channel Islands, as proposed by the Germans, the Bailiff of Jersey with the agreement of the German authorities was allowed to send a message to Britain in November 1944 stating the level of food reserves available to the civilians with the request for Red Cross relief. In the autumn of 1944 various escapees had passed similar messages to the British about conditions in the Islands. Britain agreed to the request and the British Joint War Organisation (British Red Cross and Order of St John) worked with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRS) to organise the relief from Lisbon. The arrival at the end of December 1944 of the ICRC ship SS Vega bringing Red Cross parcels certainly saved lives. The ship would return four more times before liberation on 9 May 1945. The third voyage brought flour, as the island had run out in February, it was white and enabled a loaf to be given to every civilian. 460,000 food parcels, each weighing over from Canada and New Zealand were delivered to the islands to be distributed by the Joint War Organisation, a British collaboration of St. John Ambulance and the British Red Cross, to the 66,000 civilian population. They were the same as parcels sent to prisoners of war. Church collections in aid of the Red Cross in early 1945 raised thousands of pounds, as people were so thankful for the help they were receiving. In total, ¬£171,000 was raised by October 1945, equivalent to around ¬£6,000,000 in today's money. This would continue after the war with the Red Cross being a highly favoured charity.  Clothing  Clothing and shoes were quickly rationed as shops sold out. Jersey opened the Summerland factory to make clothes out of blankets, curtains and sheets. Nothing was thrown away, knitted objects were unravelled and remade. Other clothes were patched and repaired. Clothes in houses that belonged to evacuated people were requisitioned. As people lost weight due to the diet, new clothes needed to be found or clothes adjusted. Elastic supplies ran out. Shortages of needles and thread were relieved with supplies from France. Shoes were a major problem, leather became impossible to obtain. Soles of shoes were made out of rope and wood. Uppers were knitted. 45,000 pairs of sabot were made in Jersey. Such inflexible shoes gave people foot troubles. Through 1943 the controller of footwear in Guernsey was supplying 60 people a day with shoes. Washing clothes became a problem as time moved on, no soap and no fuel to heat water to wash clothes in. Most people outside the towns used wells as a source of water.  Banks and shops = Banks = zinc 5 Reichspfennig for use in the occupied territories People evacuating had been limited to the amount of cash they could withdraw, these people putting deeds and valuables in safe deposit boxes. Germans later demanded access to these safe deposit boxes, looking for valuables. A box of gold coins from Barclays Bank, Guernsey, was carried on board an evacuation ship by one of the bank's employees. ¬£384,043 in English money was left in the Channel Islands. British notes and coins became rare in 1941 and were supplemented by islands printing notes ranging from 6d to ¬£1. German occupation marks were in circulation at a fixed exchange rate of two shillings and a penny to a ‚Äò‚ÄôReichsmark‚Äô‚Äô, favourable to the Germans. At the end of the war ‚Äò‚ÄôReichsmarks‚Äô‚Äô were exchanged back to Pounds at face value, a three-ton British army truck having arrived in each island loaded with ¬£1m of English bank notes, which annoyed one farmer who had burnt two suitcases full of occupation notes a few days before, thinking they were worthless. = Shops = Shops quickly ran out of supplies, the buyers were German soldiers wanting to send parcels of luxuries home as well as locals, who had some money, buying up goods whilst they were available. Shops also hoarded goods, waiting for prices to rise. There were few supplies arriving in the islands from France to restock the shops. Almost all goods had a government fixed maximum price attached with vendors being fined heavily for selling above the set price. Bartering became common, advertisements in shops and the local papers offered a wide range of goods to meet a specific urgent need of the advertiser. Exchanges such as a nightgown for flour or a breeding rabbit for good shoes. Empty shops became exchange locations for a small fee. Shops specialising in repair were in high demand, especially bicycle shops, and machinery and shoe repair shops. Old fire hoses were made into bicycle tyres, as were garden hoses. Chemists were called on to create exhausted items, like glue and matches. Oil and paraffin lamps were made from tins. = Black market = Hoarding food and goods became a business as rationing became stricter and shortages grew worse. Goods could always be traded. Both hoarding and bartering certain goods were illegal. There were 100 prosecutions in Guernsey in 1944, up from 40 in 1942. Dealers in the black market included German officers and men as well as OT workers and many civilians. The worst off during the occupation were the poor in the island towns those who had no access to farms and could not afford the black market prices. The rich did not live well, but at least could buy adequate quantities of basic food. Prisoners could supplement their worse than normal rations by paying heavily for black market foods to be brought to them.  Activities = Schools = 5,000 Guernsey schoolchildren had been evacuated and many of the now empty classrooms closed. Some schools were used for barracks by soldiers and administrative offices, the Forest school in Guernsey became a hospital, as did the Jersey College for Girls building. A few teachers had remained in Guernsey and a few retired teachers helped teach the children who stayed, 1,421 in Guernsey, of which 1,100 were in school. In Jersey, the reverse happened, all but 1,000 of the 5,500 children stayed in the island with 140 teachers. All schools were provided with air raid shelters for the children. Sitting 11 year exams continued as normal in Jersey in January 1941 with children taking the bus to St Helier, talking amongst themselves in J√®rriais. The only change to the curriculum was the compulsory teaching of German as a language from January 1942, taught by local teachers to avoid German officers being sent into schools. Supplies such as paper, were short so slates were reintroduced. The school leaving age in Jersey was increased to 15 to try to stop youngsters getting into trouble on the streets, despite this, two girls aged 14 and 15 spent three days in jail for spitting cherry stones at Germans. The classrooms still in use were unheated and lighting was limited, even so examinations were set and sat by the older pupils. After the war leaving certificates were presented once papers had been marked externally. = Entertainment = The occupation had a limited impact, band concerts in parks were provided by the Germans. Theatres stayed open, sometimes operating in church halls, until summer 1944. Censors limited productions and the curfew required productions to start earlier than normal. During the summer of 1943 75,000 attended shows at Candie in Guernsey. Demonstrations at Cinemas August 1941 Jersey Cinemas stayed open, with separation of German soldiers and civilians, however the number of films was limited, Jersey and Guernsey exchanged their films which were supplemented with French and German language films from the continent. When allied soldiers were shown, even if prisoners, the local audience would cheer. Interest in the cinema flagged for civilians when the supply of English films ran out. Dance classes took place through the war. Dances with German soldiers and local girls took place from 1942, however in 1943 they were banned in Jersey due to an outbreak of diphtheria. A dance show in Guernsey attracted an audience of 500 a performance for a fortnight. Boxing tournaments were popular entertainment, as were Beetle Drives. Public houses stayed open, with reduced hours and limits on selling hard spirits. Card games, including the local Euchre, darts and shove ha'penny were popular. Sport was also popular and continued as a relief from boredom, until the shortage of food left people without the energy to participate. Occasionally games were followed by a visit to a pub for a half pint, if they had some. One football match attracted a crowd of over 4,000. There were recorded games against German teams, a football game in July 1940 was won by Guernsey. Sport also included, cricket, baseball, rugby and in 1940 a church to church walk. With the curfew, home entertaining had to finish earlier than normal, whether it was having a meal, a musical evening or to play card games, or else everyone spent the night, returning home next morning. From 6 June 1944, all amusements and theatres were closed. Curfew was extended from 9pm to 6am. Distant guns could be heard. Care had to be taken during the war over showing a light at night as it was not unknown for a German soldier to simply shoot at a lit window. = Clubs = Many clubs were allowed to stay open, after applying for permission, with a few exceptions, such as the Salvation Army the Odd Fellows and many children's clubs including the Scouts, Girl Guides, Boys' Brigade and Girls' Life Brigade. The Freemasons were closed down, but avoided persecution, as had happened elsewhere although moveable property was stolen and the buildings devastated by Germans. There were occasional restrictions placed on numbers of people meeting, such as at military funerals following the large numbers who turned out to pay their respects to drowned British sailors.  Transport and fuel  The rationing of petrol caused civilian cars and then motorcycles to leave the roads within days of the occupation starting. A limited bus service ran for a while. Some delivery vans were allowed. Bicycles became the standard form of transport, but strong bikes were requisitioned by the Germans. The horse and cart came back into use for freight and as a horse-drawn bus, with old prams being used by people to transport heavy goods. Attaching a basket to a walking stick also helped. = Petrol = Immediately rationed from July 1940, civilian cars almost ceased to operate. There were exceptions such as for doctors, a number of people had to swap to motorcycles to eke out the legal fuel ration. The mileage of vehicles had to be reported to ensure black market fuel was not being added, leading to needing to disconnect speedometers to avoid discovery. A large number of vehicles were requisitioned by the Germans and shipped to France. Over 100 buses, cars, vans, lorries and even an ambulance were converted to run on wood gas, produced using charcoal and wood, called Gazogene units = Heating, lighting and cooking = Coal could no longer be imported from June 1944 and ran out three months later. Small amounts of peat were cut for fuel. Gas was restricted from 1941, both by appliances and the hours when it was available, running out completely in December 1944. Electricity restrictions started in April 1942, with limited usage and hours of use, the supply ceasing in February 1945. The shortage of power for pumping caused the piped water supply to be restricted. The cutting of wood was restricted from the start of the occupation and rationed from July 1941. Gathering wood needed a permit, even if on your own land. Late in the war people started stripping empty houses of wood then burning furniture. In December 1944 a household with 6 people with no gas or electricity were allowed 2cwt, of wood a week. The scenery had changed by the end of the war, many thousands of trees had been cut down all over the islands. Paraffin lamps were made out of tins. It was only allowed for lighting and supplies ran out in July 1944. Candles were scarce, households were allowed only one per week. Matches were also very scarce. The old tradition system of taking food in crocks, such as Bean Jar to a bakers to cook in their cooling ovens during the day, for a fee of 3d was encouraged. Haybox cooking became popular. This required food in a pot to be brought up to heat, then the pot was placed in the centre of a box, packed with hay and left to cook slowly for hours, without using additional fuel. Furze ovens were brought back into use in old farmhouses. Communal kitchens were set up, as early as 1940. Jersey using commercial facilities such as bakeries had produced 400,000 meals by the end of 1943 and the States of Jersey had supplied over 2,000,000 pints of soup. Guernsey relied more on mobilising the voluntary sector. Sawdust stoves were made from a tin, with the compacted sawdust mixed with tar burnt to create heat.  Communications  All external telephone links were severed within days of occupation and all radio transmitters were seized. Post was disrupted and subject to censorship and control, with initially no post permitted outside of the islands. English postage stamps continued in use; when they ran out in 1941, 2d stamps were cut diagonally in half to make 1d stamps. and in both islands local stamps were printed, in Jersey incorporating the royal cipher GR. In September 1940 the first letters allowed to be sent via the Red Cross from Jersey were limited to 220 in number. The Germans initially refused to accept any letters to anyone who had evacuated the Island before the invasion. In Guernsey in 1940, the Germans proposed, instead of letters, to record a message to be transmitted by them over a radio so that people in Britain could listen. The message recorded by Ambrose Sherwill was broadcast and caused controversy as it mentioned the exemplary conduct of the German soldiers and how the population was being well looked after. This was not the way Churchill wished the Germans to be perceived, but would have provided comfort to islanders in Britain. During the occupation, no civilians had access to a radio transmitter, nor was any attempt made from England to deliver one to the islands. Telephone calls were listened to at the exchanges. Not many people had phones, even so the usage by civilians ceased in June 1944 and even by emergency services from January 1945. = Red Cross Messages = December 1941 Red Cross letter from England Red Cross messages became very important to the islanders. Normally routed via Germany then Sweden or Portugal, it could take weeks or months to arrive. The number of words written on the cards was limited, as well as vetted. Many islanders placed secret codes in their messages to their evacuated relatives. Many Red Cross letters were published in a monthly magazine, The Channel Islands Monthly Review created in Stockport, England by adult Channel Island evacuees. This was one area where restriction were gradually lifted, the number of words increased from 10 to 25. The number and frequency of cards one could send also increased. The requirement to come and collect your message changed to simply posting the message to recipients. Nearly one million messages were dealt with by the bureau volunteers before the islands were isolated in late 1944 and messages stopped. = Censorship = Newspapers were censored from the start, with papers often carrying articles written by Germans who purported to be editors. Printing exactly what they were given, the bad English used in \\"German\\" articles gave away the propaganda items. During those months when it was possible to listen to the BBC openly it was also clear who was telling the truth. A Jersey paper written in Jersey French caused problems for the Germans as they could not translate it and it ceased production. Paper became scarce so newspapers became smaller, dropping to just one page and then began to print on alternate days. Official announcements being displayed in shop windows. Resistance newssheets were printed secretly as a means of circulating news from the BBC. Most people involved were eventually arrested and a number died in prisons. Allied propaganda leaflets were not dropped after summer 1940. In autumn 1944 leaflets were dropped to encourage Germans to surrender. Libraries were popular and operated through the war after having some titles withdrawn through censorship. = Radios = For the first four months, radio receivers were permitted and people could listen to the BBC. Then, following a preliminary commando raid when two men were trapped in Guernsey, 8,000 radios were confiscated and handed in within Guernsey alone. It was easy to identify owners as almost everyone had a BBC radio licence. Returned in December 1940 they were again confiscated in June 1942 for \\"military reasons\\" a coincidence that it followed a devastating raid by 1,000 bombers on Cologne. If people had more than one radio, they might hold one back, or just hand in an old broken set. Other people made crystal radio sets. It was possible to make crystals, wire was available, the hardest object was a speaker. Stripping down telephone receivers solved that problem. Radios and crystal sets had to be well hidden as listening to them had severe penalties of up to six months in prison with a very heavy fine. Imprisonment of a number of people resulting in some deaths, including Frederick William Page who died in Naumburg-an-der-Saale penal prison. The BBC did not broadcast any programmes aimed at the Channel Island civilians for fear of retribution being made against the civilians, it left the islanders feeling forgotten although in July 1940 on the Forces programme a message was transmitted about the progress of evacuated children. and on 24 April 1942 a message was sent. 20 minute programmes were scheduled by the BBC for Christmas Day 1941. and on the same day in 1942 however it is not known if they were broadcast = Rumours = Every day rumours circulated, a few even having a semblance of truth, expanded and changed they would return again and again to the same listener, similar to the children's game Chinese whispers. Malicious tongues, false statements and sheer inventions created false truths about people. A few rumours helped morale, especially ones where the Germans came off worst, such as one involving five local doctors, each dressed in a singlet and shorts marched down to a closed beach singing German songs, past a sentry. After a nice swim they returned, marching past the sentry and went home.  Alderney and Sark  There were almost no civilians in Alderney during the occupation, the handful that did, worked to feed themselves and undertook work for the thousands of OT workers and soldiers. In addition a few local islanders were asked to undertake temporary work in Alderney, such as marine divers. On Sark, apart from two raids by British commandos, Operation Basalt and Hardtack 7, an Avro Lancaster bomber crash landing on the island and some of their citizens being included in the deportations, their war, thanks to the Dame of Sark, Sibyl Hathaway, was peaceful and the soldiers very well behaved. The island supplied fish to Guernsey in exchange for other goods.  Medical treatment  The reduction in normally accepted facilities, heating, warm food, warm dry clothing, soap as well as a poor diet resulted in an increase in minor ailments such as dysentery, head lice and scabies, and in major ailments such as typhus, brought to the islands by Russian OT workers. This resulted in a number of deaths. Typhoid and infectious hepatitis appeared more frequently as the war progressed and clean water became scarce. Ambulances changed from motorised back to a horse-drawn wagons. Doctors, dentists, nurses and St John ambulance staff worked quite closely together, treating civilians, soldiers and OT workers. There were restrictions regarding helping injured German soldiers from 1942. Each group had their own hospital. An outbreak of diphtheria in Jersey quickly led to the island running out of antitoxin, it was contained by isolation and bans on public gatherings. Medical supplies where possible, were made locally, bandages made from torn up sheets, moss was an alternative for cotton wool, with some medicines sourced from France. A few supplies, such as insulin, came through after 1942 from the Red Cross, but too late for 30 patients in Jersey. Babies born during the occupation received the best facilities available, irrespective of whom the father might be, with midwives in Jersey having to learn the different way female Soviet OT workers birthed and then wrapped up their babies in a cocoon. Malnutrition became common amongst most civilians, some losing up to 40% of their body weight. This led to related illnesses, with swellings, bad teeth and making them susceptible to diseases like tuberculosis. The death rate in January 1945 in Jersey was three times normal.  Dangers  There were accidents and crimes against civilians resulting in serious injury and death throughout the occupation, such as: A 17 year old who trod on a mine and died. Shrapnel from exploding anti aircraft shells caused injuries. A sea mine near Herm exploded and sank a fishing boat killing two. A man was killed in Jersey when shot on the beach trying to escape. A man was seriously burnt by an improvised petrol lamp. A man was killed and a woman badly injured by two intruders. One workman killed and three injured when British bombers attacked Guernsey airport. Farmers and house owners were injured and even killed defending their crops. A 20 year old female cyclist died after hitting a wall. A 9-year-old boy died pulling a beam from an air raid shelter to take for firewood. Bad treatment and conditions, especially in French prisons, resulted in numerous deaths. Deaths during the occupation within the Bailiwicks: * German forces: about 550 * OT workers: over 700 (500 graves and 200 drowned when a ship was sunk) * Allied forces: about 550 (504 from the sinking of HMS Charybdis and HMS Limbourne) * Civilians: about 150, mainly air raids, deportees and in prisons :(excludes hundreds of civilian Island deaths from suicide, malnutrition and the cold, in 1943 there were 460 deaths in Guernsey and 719 in Jersey, under 2% of the populations, from 1944 the death rate rose, with over 200 deaths in Guernsey in the first quarter of 1944 alone. Winter 1944-45 was worse and in addition there were those who died during 1945-46, never having recovered from the ordeal.)  Liberation  Expected for several weeks, at dawn on 9 May 1945 Allied ships were visible from Guernsey. Crowds gathered and a few British troops landing amidst great celebrations, German troops remained in barracks. Some ships went on to Jersey to make an official landing and accept their surrender. Men, vehicles and supplies were pouring ashore from Force 135, by 12 May. After the initial jubilation, the practical aspects of getting the islands \\"back to normal\\" could begin. Initial needs for food, clothing, medicines and basics, even toilet paper, were brought in on landing ships until harbours could be cleared of mines. German soldiers were shipped out on the now empty landing ships. Arms and ammunition were collected and civilians went souvenir hunting; pistols, daggers and medals were very popular. Military equipment was gathered together. Mine clearing took months. Mines are still being found in the islands. The 20,000 evacuees started to return in batches from July, with 2,000 deportees returning in August. The children, many of whom were very young when they had left five years earlier, hardly knew their relatives and many could no longer speak the local Patois language. Many evacuees felt that they were treated as second class citizens by those who had remained during the occupation, because they had left in 1940. Men and women who had volunteered for the armed services returned when demobbed, mainly in 1946. Relationships would have been difficult at first. Returned children not understanding why you did not throw any food away, even having to eat apple cores. Accusations and recriminations flew around. Some civilians were angry at the Germans, some at the British for abandoning them and many at other civilians for how they had behaved. Investigators turned up looking for war crimes. The bulk of civilians went looking for work, rebuilding their strength with the improved food and medicines now available and trying to pick up their lives after five years of occupation. There was also a lot of work to do repairing damaged houses. After spending years in POW camps in the UK, a handful of Germans returned to the islands to marry their sweethearts, as did a number of OT workers, they received mixed reactions from islanders. The island governments were bankrupt, as they had to pay for the cost of the occupation. They were helped by the British government with a grant. Rationing, as in the UK would continue until 1955.

Included are three late 18th- century houses and the family cemetery. The area provides a view of early settlement patterns in Maine's interior. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history In about 1780 four Paine brothers left Eastham, Massachusetts, and settled in the area that is now Gorham and Standish, Maine. One of them, Joseph, settled on the Pequawket Trail (now Maine State Route 113), the major historic route from coastal southern Maine to the Fryeburg area, on the northeast side of Watchic Pond. Although his early home no longer stands, four sons all built houses in the 1790s, three of which still stand along Route 113, along with the family cemetery. The family cemetery is located on the north side of Route 113. To its east stands the house of Myrick Paine, a two-story wood frame structure with a hip roof and four chimneys. To its west is that of Richard Paine, a 1-1/2 story Cape style house with an attached single-story wing. South of the road, roughly opposite Richard's house, is the house of Joseph Paine, Jr. It is similar to Richard's, except that it is connected to a barn. All three houses were built 1795‚Äì97, and remained in the hands of Paine descendants into the 20th century.

Early life Beall was born in Alton, Illinois on September 27, 1848. His parents, John and Mary, were one of the earliest families to settle in the city. As a young child, he witnessed the final Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas Debate held in Alton on October 15, 1858. This debate occurred during Abraham Lincoln's race for the Illinois Senate against incumbent Senator Stephen Douglas. Later in life, Beall recalled the event describing the physical differences between the two men. ‚ÄúLincoln appeared like a giant in comparison with Douglas. I understand he was six feet three inches in height. Everyone was astounded at the difference in the height of the two men.‚Äù Beall was educated while attending primary school in the town's public system. When he was seven years old, his father died. At the age of twelve, Beall was hired as an office boy and spent four years learning the printers‚Äô trade at the local paper, the Alton Daily Telegraph. As a teenager, he enlisted in the army on May 12, 1864 as a member of Company D. One Hundred and Thirty-Third Illinois Infantry. Beall was one of the youngest soldiers in the Union army in the Civil War. He was often stationed in Springfield for his duties. After President Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs assassination, his remains were eventually brought to Springfield, Illinois. Beall, just a teenager, was called to Springfield to help \\"drape Lincoln's home in mourning\\". Beall recalls the atmosphere when he arrived in Springfield he found \\"great sorrow...the people seemed as if they had lost all heart.\\" Later the President was eventually placed to rest in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Family Beall married Mary Harris on September 10, 1868 in Alton. A believer in large American families, thecouple had eight children. Their names were Edmond, Charles, Frank, Hattie May, Abbie Lou, Edward Wesley, Edmund Harris and Charles Roy. Two of his sons, Edmond and Charles, died in infancy. Influenced by his strong belief in family, Beall attracted nationwide attention by building one of the first housing units to encourage couples with multiple children to move in. The apartments became thereafter known as the 'Stork Nest' flats in Alton. In 1909, Beall purchased a home for his family on \\"Millionaire's Row\\". A street where mansions were built in the 1870s to early 1900s. He lived there with his wife until his death. Today, his home is known as the Beall Mansion. In 1911, Beall toured Europe and brought back many influences from abroad. \\"Ever being a lover of art and flowers, Mr. Beall brought back many handsome trophies which now adorn his beautiful home on Twelfth Street\\" While in Europe, Beall visited Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. She presented the 'Stork Mayor\\" of Alton a beautiful diamond. In 1918, Mr. and Mrs. Beall celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary in their home. According to the local paper, \\"Mr. Beall presented his wife with fifty white roses, bearing the card \\"Still My Bride.\\" He also gave her fifty dollars in gold in honor of the golden event.\\" Businessman Upon his return from the army, Beall went to serve an apprenticeship with his step-father, J. Millen. During the apprenticeship, Beall learned the trade of manufacturing mining tools. In 1872, Beall and his brother, Charles, started a small firm to manufacture mining tools. They named it Beall Brothers. The company continued to expand into multiple firms, but eventually was consolidated. In 1905, The Iron Trade Review reported the status of the manufacturing company, \\"The Beall Bros Mining Tool Company, the Beall Shovel Company of Alton Ill., and the CL Beall Manufacturing Company of East Alton Ill. have been consolidated into one company the Beall Bros Co. The capital stock is $158,000.\\" By 1907, the Beall family had built their company into the largest manufacturer of miner's tools, railroad implements and heavy equipment in the United States. According to records, \\"The product of the three factories equals a million dollars in value annually.\\" Political life Beall began his political life as an Alderman of the fourth ward of Alton. In 1905, Beall, became a candidate for mayor of Alton. He won the election and went on to serve three successful terms of two years each, from 1905 to 1911, the only man in the history of the city who achieved that. As mayor, he helped implement multiple solutions to improve the city. He became the head of the streets and alleys committee and vigorously promoted the paving of Alton streets with brick. ‚ÄúHe is considered the man who pulled Alton out of the mud by spearheading the paving of streets and roads throughout the city.‚Äù According to the History of Madison County, from 1905 to 1911 Beall helped pave \\"twenty miles of streets...nearly half as many miles of sewer, and began building of concrete sidewalks\\" Furthermore, Beall continued to help beautify the city \\"by having flower-beds placed in the arid byways. Rock Spring Park was given Alton by William Elliot Smith through Mr. Beall 's suggestion...A fine Country Club was planned and a splendid golf course soon arranged.\\" He was elected State Senator of Illinois on November 8, 1910, from the Forty-seventh Senatorial District. While in the Senate, Beall introduced a bill to erect a monument to commemorate the first territorial governor, Ninian Edwards. In Madison County, Senator Beall with other representatives propositioned the purchase and preservation of the Great Cahokia Mound. After his term in the Capitol ended, Senator Beall returned to Alton and went on to be elected Mayor of Alton again in 1914 and served for a fourth term from 1915-1917. Death Beall died while on vacation with his wife in California on January 31, 1920. According to his obituary, erysipelas with complications was the cause of his death. He is buried in Alton City Cemetery, Alton, Illinois.
