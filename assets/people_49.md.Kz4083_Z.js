The Eastern Maiden or Southern Rock lies about 9 km from the coast at Ballygalley, or 13 miles from Larne. The West Maiden or Northern Rock is about half a mile further out. Lighthouses were built on both rocks; the West Maiden was abandoned in 1903 and the East Maiden was automated in 1977. Geology The Maidens is an example of an olivine-dolerite sill, one of many similar intrusions along the Antrim coast. They were formed during the Paleogene and Neogene periods (66 million to 2.6 million years ago), a period of intense volcanic activity in Northern Ireland. The Giant's Causeway, also from this time period, was created by volcanic eruption. At the Maidens, magma was forced underground through layers of weakness, but never reached the surface. It cooled more slowly, solidifying and leaving a hard rock, relatively resistant to weathering compared to the strata around it and so forming the islands left today. Other examples of nearby sills are Fair Head, the Portrush sill which forms Ramore Head and the Skerries, and the Knocksoghey Sill near Ballintoy, part of which forms Sheep Island.

Originally introduced in late 2005 in Quebec, and February 2006 in the rest of Canada, to promote Bell's sponsorship of the 2010 Olympics, the anthropomorphic CGI beavers were voiced in English Canada by Norm Macdonald (Frank) and Ken Hudson Campbell (Gordon).http://blogs.voices.com/voxdaily/2006/02/frank_and_gordon.html source Their misadventures with Frank getting flustered with the dimwitted Gordon made them two of the best known corporate mascots in Canada. The animated duo were created by Montreal-based Buzz Image for the Cossette advertising agency in Quebec City.  History  right  Early years  The early commercials showed Frank and Gordon on their journey to becoming Bell mascots; from waiting outside the audition room with other human and animal hopefuls, to the audition itself, and then the meeting with Bell management when they were informed that they had \\"got the gig\\" while Gordon eyed up a sandwich on the desk. This third commercial was also the first to be created in two forms, one for English Canada, and a separate version for Francophone Canada. The English version showed them in a dumpy-looking office with a tired-sounding (but unseen) male manager who presented them with maple-leaf tuques (tukes, or woolen hats) to enhance their Canadian patriotism in their upcoming Bell commercials to air during the 2006 Winter Olympics. The French version took place in a plush executive suite, with a sultry-sounding (but unseen) female manager, who did not present them with toques. The next few commercials followed a similar thread, with Frank and Gordon getting accustomed to their new-found fame, and a house full of Bell TV/cell phone/internet -aided items at their disposal while watching the 2006 Winter Olympics. However, in the English versions, they always had their maple-leaf tuques on, and appeared in somewhat rundown conditions with ratty furniture and empty beer cans littered around, while in the French versions, the toques were not seen, and their living room appeared opulent. In one commercial, Frank pauses the TV picture on the Bell digital video recorder in the middle of figure skating that Gordon is watching, and urges Gordon to groom as Gordon coughs up a hairball. In another, Gordon claims to be sick of seeing himself on TV, so Frank suggests he go out of the house and exercise to lose some of his newly gained weight. Gordon replies that the camera \\"adds 10 pounds\\".  Post-Torino 2006  After the 2006 Winter Olympics, the English and French commercials became unified. Most of them merely advertised Bell products, and dropped the ongoing, engaging story-line between the two main characters. One exception is the Bring It Home () campaign, which takes a brief look back at previous Frank and Gordon commercials before promoting Bell as a Vancouver 2010 official sponsor.  Campaign end  The beavers appeared in their final ad for Bell on August 1, 2008http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/08/01/tech-bell.html - more than a year before the Vancouver Olympics the pair was purportedly created to promote. Bell had recently been taken over by a new management team (in connection to its then-pending, but later canceled, sale to a group led by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan), and a spokesperson for the company said that ending the Frank and Gordon campaign (and the introduction of a new Bell logo and ad campaign later that week) was symbolic of that change.

One skit featured Bertrand who was fired because Bill outsourced their calling centres to India. Bertrand, trying to wash windshields on the street, gets squashed by a car. The parody commercial ends with the message: \\"√©crasez les syndicats avec Bill Canada\\", which translates to \\"squash trade unions with Bill Canada\\". The skit is based on two controversial events: the Bell Subco strike of 2005, and the outsourcing of Bell Canada's phone-based customer service to foreign countries such as India. Another skit featured a parody of Frank and Gordon's infamous Megaphone commercial.  Videotron  To promote its Internet services, Videotron parodied the Frank & Gordon campaign with a commercial. It consists of a beaver, likely representing Bell Canada, in a wood logging competition against a man wearing a Videotron-branded helmet. While the beaver could only cut the log using its teeth, the Videotron man could use various wood cutting equipment such as a two-man saw or a chainsaw to represent different speed tiers. This allowed the man to cut out five different pieces of wood from the log. At the end of the commercial, the beaver is still cutting the log with his teeth, and has not finished cutting out a single piece of the log yet.

The ad was created by art director Bob Gage, who also directed the commercial. It first aired in 1972. The popular ad campaign featuring Mikey remained in regular rotation for more than 12 years and ended up as one of the longest continuously running commercial campaigns ever aired. Original commercial The iconic commercial centers on three young brothers eating breakfast. Before them sits a heaping bowl of Life breakfast cereal. Two of the brothers question each other about the cereal, prodding each other to try it, and noting that it is supposed to be healthy. Neither boy has any desire to taste it (\\"I'm not gonna try it‚Äîyou try it!\\"), so they get their brother Mikey to do so (\\"Let's get Mikey\\"), noting, \\"he hates everything\\". Mikey briefly stares at the bowl. After moments of contemplation, he begins to vigorously consume the cereal before him, resulting in his brothers excitedly exclaiming, \\"He likes it! Hey, Mikey!\\" Mikey's brothers in the commercial are Gilchrist's actual brothers, named Michael (the one on the left in the spot) and Tommy. John is the middle child of seven children born to Tom and Pat Gilchrist of the Bronx.. Reception The advertisement was very popular and won a Clio Award in 1974. It was also often referenced in retrospectives of classic television advertisements. For example, in 1999, TV Guide ranked it the No. 10 commercial of all time. Despite the commercial's age, a 1999 survey noted that 70 percent of adults could identify the spot based on just a \\"brief generic description.\\" Sequels A series of \\"Today's Mikey\\" ads aired in the 1980s, with Gilchrist bemusedly reprising the character as a college student. In 1996, Quaker Oats commissioned director Rick Schulze, of Industrial Light & Magic Commercial Productions, to digitally composite a bottle of Snapple, then a subsidiary of Quaker Oats, into the original Life ad, via longtime Snapple ad agency Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, New York. This time, however, in an ironic twist, Mikey likes some of the product's flavors while disliking the others. Life's ad agency, Foote, Cone & Belding, in Chicago, revived the Mikey character for two campaigns in the late 1990s. In 1997, Quaker Oats initiated a nationwide search for the \\"next Mikey\\", settling on 4-year-old Marli Hughes out of more than 35,000 applicants. She also appeared in a TV commercial, \\"Better Life\\" directed by Howard Rose, where she is seen telling her classmates how she won the contest and traveled to New York to do some TV shows. She adds that as the new Mikey she gets to eat as much Life cereal as she wants. In 1999, Quaker Oats remade the commercial word for word with an all-adult cast acting like kids. Mikey is portrayed by New York-based actor Jimmy Starace. Afterward By 2012, aged 44, Gilchrist had become director of media sales for MSG Network. He has said that he has no clear memories of filming the original commercial as he was only three and a half years old.

Life  His father Lodewijk Caspar Valckenaer was Franeker university's professor of law and, in 1766, was appointed to succeed Tiberius Hemsterhuis at Leiden. Johan, in the meantime, had become deeply interested in classical and French writers such as Voltaire and Rousseau. He graduated in 1781. His family was related to the Luzacs, publishers of the internationally renowned newspaper \\"Gazette de Leyde\\" - Emilie Luzac and her father Johan were Valckenaer's cousins. In 1782, Valckenaer was appointed to the College of Franeker, but in May 1787 was discharged for his membership of an exercitiegenootschap. He got an appointment in Utrecht, then a democratic Patriot stronghold. At the beginning September Valckenaer tried in vain to organize a force to hold back Frisian state members under the leadership of Court Lambertus van Beyma, trying to create an alternative Provincial States at Franeker. A few weeks later, after the raid on the Netherlands by a Prussian army, many patriots fled in the first place to Amsterdam, then to Brussels and Saint-Omer in northern France. The most important Patriots, such as Wybo Fijnje, H. W. Daendels, Adam Gerard Mappa and Valckenaer lived temporarily in a castle in Watten and formed a kind of commune, that jointly bought a billiards set, restored the rooms and grew its own vegetables. In between Valckenaer and Van Beyma were no friends anymore. In his flight from Franeker, Van Beyma forgot to take signed and extremely chargeable documents with him, so that a large group of Frisian patriots could be jailed and within two years condemned. Valckenaer was furious. Then both men also got into a quarrel over the distribution of the travel expenses. Nevertheless, Van Beyma and Valckenaer both organized the benefit payments originating from the French state. A difference of understanding between Valckenaer and Van Beyma about leadership in politics, the establishment of an employment project, a shipbuilding enterprise in Gravelines, the care of the administration and the size of the payments brought about an even more violent break between them, with Valckenaeristen and Beymanisten factions of Patriots fighting each other in pamphlets. The dispute reached a climax in 1791. Valckenaer got no payment from Van Beyma, but did get the support of the patriot members of the former political establishment and so won the dispute. In 1792, the commune was dissolved and a Batavian Revolutionary Committee set up. In January 1795, the \\"Batavian Legion over the Rhine\\" carried out a velvet revolution. Johan Valckenaar got an appointment in Leiden. In 1796, he was chosen as a member of the Batavian Republic's National Assembly. Already freely shortly was he of opinion that the revolutions had come full circle and accepted an embassy from Madrid, and attempted to get the Spanish support against England. In the Netherlands, he chose to return to being a gentleman farmer (Hereboer), as a hoofdingeland of the Rhine country. In 1805 he also had contact with Maria Hulshoff. Under king Louis Bonaparte, he became a financial counsellor. He died in 1821 in his mansion outside Bennebroek, where he regularly invited his friends Theodorus van Kooten (who had also traveled with him to Spain), Samuel Iperusz Wiselius, Willem Bilderdijk and Anton Reinhard Falck.

This is an exothermic reaction, so steps must be taken to control the temperature. Urea nitrate explosions may be initiated using a blasting cap. Chemistry Urea contains a carbonyl group. The more electronegative oxygen atom pulls electrons away from the carbon forming a greater electron density around the oxygen, giving the oxygen a partial negative charge and forming a polar bond. When nitric acid is presented, it ionizes. A hydrogen cation contributed by the acid is attracted to the oxygen and forms a covalent bond [electrophile H+].

History Pescadero is Spanish for \\"fishing place\\". In early Mexican land grants or disue√±os, John Gilroy stated \\"The Castros, I and an Indian gave it that name in 1814, being a place where we used to catch salmon.\\" Arroyo del Pescadero appears on the disue√±os of the 1830s. The 1860s' Coast Survey called it the Pescador River. Spanish-speaking people founded the town of Pescadero, California in 1856. The pre-European Pescadero watershed was occupied by the Ohlone. The Quirostes controlled the area from Bean Hollow Creek southward to A√±o Nuevo Creek and inland to Butano Ridge. The Oljon controlled from the lower San Gregorio Creek drainage southward to Bean Hollow Creek, including the lower Pescadero and Butano drainages. The Cotogen held the land in and around Purisima Creek. When the Portol√† Expedition traveled on horseback along the immediate coast on October 24, 1769, Padre Juan Cresp√≠ wrote, \\"Only in the watercourses are any trees to be seen; elsewhere we saw nothing but grass, and that was burned.\\" The Ohlone managed the land with the most effective tool they had, fire. The Santa Cruz Lumber Company built a sawmill at Saratoga Gap in 1923. The company formed a log pond by building a wooden dam in the creek, and the sawmill was built over the creek downstream of the log pond. The sawmill employed fifty to eighty men manufacturing sixty- thousand board foot of redwood and Douglas fir lumber daily. A forest railway was extended more than up Pescadero Creek to bring logs down to the sawmill after loggers had felled all trees close enough to be winched to the mill with cables. Railway operations began when the company purchased a 2-truck Shay locomotive (Lima Locomotive Works number 2461) from the San Joaquin and Eastern Railroad in 1930 and continued until the railroad grade was converted to a truck road in 1950. The sawmill ceased operations in 1972. Farmers began building levees and drained small areas of the marsh by the late 1920s. Substantial levee building and conversion of marshlands to agriculture occurred during the 1930s, and continued through the early 1960s. The State began acquiring land in the 1960s. In the early 1960s local farmers used a dragline to remove sediment from Butano Creek channel below Pescadero Bridge for several thousand feet down stream. The sediment removed was used to build a 6,000 foot levee on the west side of Butano Creek. Other levees were built to keep salt water out of agricultural fields. California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) required the dragline practice to stop following the introduction of new fish protection laws in 1963. The Highway One bridge was rebuilt (1989‚Äì90) with fewer supports and closer to the ocean to minimize effects on the stream and lagoon; the original bridge had been built in the early 1940s. Ecology Intensive logging and watershed development, also beginning in the late 1920s or early 1930s, has dramatically increased sedimentation in Butano and Pescadero creeks. Both streams are listed under the federal Clean Water Act as impaired water bodies for sediment. Concerns about agricultural pesticide runoff into the marsh prompted a report prepared by DFG. Jong confirmed eutrophic (high nutrient) conditions in the marsh and found that algae blooms raise dissolve oxygen (DO) levels to saturation during the day and deplete levels during night respiration. Jong speculated that the low night DO could result in fish kills. The DFG study found levels of pesticides potentially toxic to fish in the sediment. In the mid-1980s the west bank levee of Butano Creek was breached about 50 feet downstream of Pescadero Road Bridge in order to reduce flood flows down the Butano Creek channel in the marsh. Breaches in other levees of the North Butano Marsh were also made to improve circulation. Historically, both Pescadero Creek and Butano Creek, as well as several tributary streams, supported runs of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Steelhead are still present, but there have been only sparse reports of coho in the watershed in recent years. Before logging removed much of the dense forest cover of this area in the middle of the 20th century, these streams were shaded, with frequent, stable pools created by fallen trees, bedrock outcrops, and boulders, and an abundant, if not steady, supply of gravel. With cool stream temperatures and reliable flows through the summer, they provided excellent habitat for salmon and trout, and both Pescadero Creek and Butano Creek were renowned sports fishing streams for vacationing San Franciscans in the late 19th century. According to a study by Professor Jerry Smith San Jose State University, estimates in 1985 showed that 10,000 steelhead trout were rearing in the lagoon. As of 2008, 750 steelhead were counted in the same area. With the exception of a few juvenile coho observed in Peters Creek in 1999, salmon have been absent from the watershed until a 2003 release of 17,000 hatchery-raised coho smolts in Pescadero Creek. Very few of these coho have returned to the creek. In spring 2015, biologists discovered three coho salmon (with tags from the nearby Scott Creek hatchery) spawning in Pescadero Creek. California Golden Beaver (Castor canadensis subauratus) were re- introduced to Pescadero Creek around 1937-1938 by the DFG after near extinction in California in the early twentieth century. The beavers continue to thrive and although concerns about flooding related to beaver dams occurs, there is evidence that beaver in the lower channel in the 1950s reduced sediment movement through the system, especially since the late 1980s. Beaver improve salmonid abundance and size as their beaver ponds recharge the water table which, in turn, replenishes stream flows in the dry season and by providing ideal over-summering habitat. Contrary to popular myth, most beaver dams do not pose barriers to trout and salmon migration, although they may be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. An extensive review recently proved that beaver were historically native to all of California except the most arid deserts, including coastal California. Pescadero Marsh Located at the confluence of Pescadero and Butano Creeks, the area known as Pescadero Marsh has for decades been a thriving habitat for both migratory and native wildlife. Besides being a refuge and nesting ground for wintering waterfowl, the Marsh ia a critical spawning area and nursery for coho salmon, steelhead trout, tidewater goby, and many other threatened or endangered fish, amphibian, and reptile species. Since 1995, annual fish \\"die- offs\\" of hundreds of juvenile fish, crabs, and other species occur in the late fall when the sandbar barrier between the lagoon and the ocean is breached. As water levels fluctuate, many species are cut off from supportive habitat, and the entire eco-system degrades. Since 1998 concerned citizens and other wildlife agencies have repeatedly asked California State Parks to take immediate corrective action. The Parks department has failed to respond and has instead moved to request further studies. Meanwhile, native species populations in the marsh have reached critically low levels. The Pescadero Lagoon Science Panel was established in 2013 to provide independent scientific expertise in support of management decisions and possible restoration actions for Pescadero marsh and lagoon. =Steelhead restoration= A federal project to revive the steelhead trout population showed success in 2012, and may be continued in 2013. Watershed The Pescadero-Butano watershed is the largest coastal watershed between the Golden Gate and the San Lorenzo River. The watershed's two principal streams, Pescadero Creek and Butano Creek, which have their confluence in Pescadero Marsh, drain of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Peters Creek in Portola Redwoods State Park, Oil Creek, Slate Creek and Butano Creek are the largest of many tributaries of Pescadero Creek.

History  According to Frances M. Molera, a butano is what the early Californians called a drinking cup made from the horn of a bull or other animal. Padre Jaime Escudet made the first recorded mention of El Butano on July 7, 1816 and Arollo del Butano is shown on a di≈õeno of the San Antonio or Pescadero land grant of 1833. A land grant called El Butano was made in 1838 and 1844 and mentions a Bolsa del Butano.  Watershed and Course  Butano Creek's origin in the Santa Cruz Mountains is just above the San Mateo County and Santa Cruz County line at a bend in China Grade Road at the south end of Butano Ridge. It is first joined from the left (heading downstream) by South Fork Butano Creek, then on the left by Little Butano Creek at the intersection of Canyon Road and Cloverdale Road. Little Butano Creek is almost entirely protected by Butano State Park.  Ecology and Conservation  Butano Creek was historically used by spawning steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) but not coho were returning to either Butano or Pescadero Creeks by 2003, when 17,000 hatchery- raised coho were released into Pescadero Creek. However, only three of their descendants were counted in 2015. Although a few carcasses have been found in Pescadero Creek in recent years, the species is considered functionally extinct in the Butano watershed. Siltation from cleared coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) forests began in 1923, when the Santa Cruz Lumber Co. built a sawmill over Pescadero Creek and lumberjacks cleared the pristine forests. Farms along the two creeks also led to runoff of silt and by the early 1990s a solid block of silt separated upper Butano Creek from the lower portion of the stream. With the creek disconnected from its natural course, almost annually roads and farmland were flooded, and backed up waters often reached homes in the town of Pescadero, away, where residents often had to stack sandbags. In 2019 the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District led a $7 million project with California State Parks to dredge 4,000 feet of Butano Cree, reconnecting it to its natural floodplain and removing the silt plug which has been a barrier to salmonid passage.  Recreation Camp Butano Creek is a Girl Scout camp nestled in the wooded foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains in San Mateo County. The camp is located outside the town of Pescadero and backs up to Butano State Park.

The plant forms mats or climbs using tendrils. The leaves are palmately veined and lobed, the flowers are green to yellowish green, and the fruits form clusters of very small pepos. Description The vine produces long branching annual stems that climb over shrubs and fences or trail across the ground. The stems are hairy, pale green and furrowed. The alternate leaves have three to five palmate lobes and can be across. The margin is slightly toothed, the upper surface of the blade is usually hairless and the under side has fine hairs, especially on the veins. The petiole is thick and hairy, and about long. The leaf is deeply indented where it is attached to the petiole. Opposite some of the junctions formed by the petiole and stem, grow branched tendrils, and at others there are flower shoots. The flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female blooms. The male flowers are in long-stemmed racemes. Each flower is about wide, with a calyx with five pointed teeth, a whitish, green-veined corolla with five lobes, and a central boss of stamens. The small female flowers are bunched together on a short stalk, each having its ovary enclosed in a spiny, hairy fruit; one seed is produced by each flower. The fruit is about long, green at first but becomes brown with age; it is dispersed by animals which come into contact with its bristly surface. Distribution and habitat S. angulatus is native to Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and the eastern and southern parts of the United States as far west as North Dakota and Texas. It grows in fertile, moist habitats such as floodplain areas, damp grassland, thickets, bushy places, river banks, ditches and field verges. It appreciates disturbed ground. Ecology Bumblebees and honey bees, as well as various flies, sphecid wasps and vespid wasps are attracted to the nectar produced by the flowers. Some bees also collect pollen from the male flowers. The horned squash bug and Anasa repetita feed on the plant, as do the spotted cucumber beetle, the striped cucumber beetle and the leaf beetle Acalymma gouldi. Herbivorous mammals seem to avoid the plant. Uses The foliage of Sicyos angulatus can be cooked and eaten as a green vegetable, and the fruits can also be eaten, but because of their size are of little value. A decoction of the plant has been used to treat venereal disease.

In the Fucales there is no haploid phase in the reproductive cycle and therefore no alternation of generations.Fritsch, F.E. (1945). The Structure and Reproduction of the Algae. Vol 2. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge The thallus is a sporophyte.Smith, G.M. (1938). Cryptogamic Botany. Algae and Fungi. Second edition, Volume 1, McGraw-Hill Bok Company, Inc. The diploid plants produce male (antheridia) and female (oogonia) gametangia by meiosis. The gametes are released into the surrounding water; after fusion, the zygote settles and begins growth.Flecher, R.L. (1987). Seaweeds of the British Isles. Volume 3, Part 1. British Museum (Natural History), London. Two taxa, the corallines and Hildenbrandiaceae, bear conceptacles, although the striking difference between their formation indicates that the conceptacles are not homologous. Similar structures also exist: cryptostomata are similar to conceptacles but differ having only hairs and are sterile; caecostomata, are found only in Fucus distichus, in these the ostiole becomes blocked during development.  Morphology  Conceptacles can measure from 40-150 Œºm in diameter in some Hildenbrandiales. Some conceptacles are pits within the thallus, whereas others form raised domes protruding above it. Conceptacles open to the environment via one or many pores, depending on the species and the type of conceptacle.  Components  * Columella. This is a central pillar constituting central calcified cells covered by cellular debris. These sterile cells rise up from the conceptacle floor to form a peak. * Roof filaments. Some conceptacles form by the centripetal expansion of a hole near the thallus surface; in such cases, a roof forms by nearby filaments arching over and establishing themselves as short (often 1-9 cells long) filaments that cover the chamber, leaving a central pore through which the spores can escape. If these filaments are vicarious they may produce a beak-like opening. * Spores. In asexual conceptacles, the spores tend to be large, and so are squeezed in, filling the conceptacle chamber \\"like orange segments\\".  Types of conceptacle  There are a range of different conceptacles, classified according to the nature of the spores that they contain; some species may possess as many as four distinct types. For example, Lithophyllum incrustans bears asexual, male, female and cystocarpic (strictly, a type of female) conceptacles, discussed below. * Asexual conceptacles. These develop where weakly calcified cells break down to produce a cavity. In L. incrustans, Their columella is central and obvious (see above); it is accentuated by the spores (which may be bispores, tetraspores, etc.), which squeeze against the columella and conceptacle walls. Asexual conceptacles may be uniporate or multiporate. * Sexual (male / female) conceptacles. These lack a columella. L. incrustans has distinct male and female plants; the two conceptacle types never co-occur on the same thallus. Male conceptacles tend not to sit as deep within the thallus as female conceptacles; their size is similar although their shape tends to differ. Cells within circular regions within the perithallus lengthen to form sexual conceptacles, leaving long, wefty cells around the walls of the conceptacle. In the male conceptacles of Austrolithon, marginal filaments grow more quickly, bending in over the top of the conceptacle cavity and eventually setting up as distinct filaments that form the conceptacle roof. * Cystocarpic conceptacles. These are not associated with tissue demineralization; rather, they start to form at the centre (as a female conceptacle) and develop radially. Being mature female conceptacles, these too lack a columella. Development In most coralline algae, a cluster of reproductive cells forms in the middle layer of the alga, and is engulfed by the surrounding tissue, which grows up and over the reproductive cells to form a roof and a uniporate conceptacle. Caps may subsequently develop to protect the opening. However the conceptacle may originate at any depth within the thallus, at the surface layer or at the basal perithallus. Four different modes of asexual conceptacle formation exist. In Corallina and Bossiella, In the coralline Bossiella, the conceptacle instead forms in the outer layer. A thickening forms, which separates the outer epithallium from the underlying cortex; this thickening and the overlying epithallium will end up being the cap of the conceptacle, and the underlying cells will develop to become reproductive initials. Once the cap is formed, the filamentous cells underneath begin to degrade. The tissue around the edge of the cap grows more quickly. This combination produces a chamber beneath the cap. Evolutionary history Conceptacles appear in the fossil record at least as early as the Silurian. Similar structures have been noted in Prototaxites, which would imply that this giant land organism was not a simple fungus (as most paleontologists assume today) but a lichen.

AllƒÅhverdƒ´ (Persian: ÿØÿßŸàŸàÿØ ÿÆÿßŸÜ, ) was a Safavid Iranian military commander and politician of Georgian origin who served as governor (beglarbeg) of Ganja and Karabakh from 1627 to 1633.  Biography  Daud Khan was the son of Allahverdi Khan, a former Georgian gholam (\\"military slave\\") from the Undiladze clan who rose through the highest ranks in the Safavid administration under Shah Abbas I of Persia (r. 1588-1629). Daud-Khan, unlike his father and older brother, Imam-Quli Khan, had closer ties with the country of his origin; he was married to Helene, the sister of the Georgian king Teimuraz I of Kakheti (Tahmuras Khan), and was on friendly terms with the Georgian warlord Giorgi Saakadze (Murav Beg). Daud- Khan tried to mediate a conflict between Abbas I and the shah's recalcitrant Georgian subjects. After Shah Safi succeeded upon the death of Abbas in 1629, the new shah's mentor and yet another influential Georgian at the Safavid court, Khosrow Mirza, succeeded in sidelining the rival Undiladze clan, and persuaded Safi into removing Daud-Khan from the majles in 1630/31. In 1633, alarmed by the political purges within the Iranian ruling √©lite, Daud fled to Georgia, where he apparently encouraged his brother-in-law Teimuraz I to renew his rebellion against the Safavid overlordship. Daud claimed that one of his brothers was actually the son of the late shah Abbas I and that he, having 30,000 troops under his command, had already conquered all of Fars, Bahrain, Lar, Hormuz, Khuzestan, Arabestan, and Hoveyzeh. Teimuraz and Daud started to attack the Persian garrisons in and near Georgia and launched several raids on Ganja of which Daud-Khan had been dispossessed after his defection to Georgia. Teimuraz refused to surrender Daud in exchange of the shah's parole and allowed him a free passage to the Ottoman possessions. Since then, he disappears from the records. His brother and nephews were annihilated, and Daud's sons castrated on the shah's order, thus largely ending the career of this illustrious Iranian Georgian family. Beyond his military and administrative career, Daud Khan commissioned several building projects and patronized Catholic missioners in Georgia and Ganja.  Notes  References  Valerian N. Gabashvili.

In this building, the Dutch West India Company's governors in 1625 ordered the construction of a fort on the island of Manhattan, laying the foundations for New York City. The West-Indisch Huis is located on the Herenmarkt, a small square between the Haarlemmerstraat and Brouwersgracht canal in the center of Amsterdam. The building has municipal monument status and is in use as office space and venue for conferences, weddings and other events. The John Adams Institute, which aims to further cultural exchange between The Netherlands and the U.S., is housed in the building.  History  The building was constructed in 1617 as a meat market (on the ground floor) and waiting room for the local militia (on the upper floor). In 1623 it was rented by the Dutch West India Company, founded two years earlier, and was used until 1647 for meetings by the governing board of the Dutch West India Company. During this time the building was expanded with two wings around a central courtyard, tripling the size of the building. In 1647, the Dutch West India Company got into financial troubles and was forced to move to the West-Indisch Pakhuis, a Dutch West India Company warehouse on the IJ waterfront, which thereafter became known as the West-Indisch Huis. From 1660 the building was in use as gentlemen's lodgings (a hotel) and in 1825 it became a home for orphans and the elderly. The building underwent renovations that included removal of the high front porch and plastering of the facade. In 1975 a fire ravaged the building. The following year a foundation was set up to restore and manage the building. The restorations took place in the period 1978-1981, at a cost of 12 million guilders. In the courtyard, a fountain was placed with a bronze statue of Peter Stuyvesant, governor of New Netherland, the Dutch colony on the east coast of what is now the United States. Following renovation the building was allocated for elderly housing and taken into use as a municipal wedding hall.  Related buildings  The West-Indisch Pakhuis (West India Warehouse) in Amsterdam served as headquarters of the Dutch West India Company from 1647 until 1674. From 1674 to 1795, the company was headquartered at the Voetboogdoelen in Amsterdam, which was known as West-Indisch Huis during this period. Other Dutch towns, including Dordrecht, also had (or still have) a West-Indisch Huis. These served as headquarters for the local chambers of the Dutch West India Company. In addition to the West-Indisch Huis, Amsterdam also has an Oost-Indisch Huis (\\"East India House\\") which served as headquarters for the Dutch East India Company.

The Community office and grounds is located in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Under the Canon Law of the Catholic Church, the Community is recognized as a \\"private association of the faithful\\" with its governing statutes approved by competent Church authority; in this case by the Archbishop of Washington. In addition the Community is now a full member of the Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships, with a recognized relationship to the Roman Pontiff through the Pontifical Council on the Laity at the Vatican in Rome. Members of the Mother of God Community believe they are called to live out the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to grow in the knowledge of God through daily prayer, fellowship, evangelization, and service to the Church. Members include Christians from all walks of life ‚Äì families, couples, priests, and singles, college students, seminarians, and retired people. There are members and affiliate members, but only about a dozen members actually live in the Community's large residential house. Origins The Mother of God Community began in 1966 right after the close of Vatican II, when various housewives, particularly Edith Difato (1924 - ) and Judith Tydings, and other individuals within Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church in Potomac, Maryland, began experiencing a new awakening of the Holy Spirit and of God's love in their lives. They began meeting daily after Mass and read the documents of Vatican II and other works about the role of the Holy Spirit in both the lives of saints and in those of ordinary people. The first recorded prayer meeting took place on June 7, 1968, in the parish hall of Our Lady of Mercy parish in Potomac, Maryland with more than 90 persons in attendance. It is considered by many as the first prayer meeting in the Eastern part of the U.S. of the movement which would later be called the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, for it was shortly thereafter that participants began hearing about similar prayer meetings and outpourings of the Spirit in places like Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, South Bend, Indiana, Ann Arbor, Michigan and other cities. The prayer group in Potomac, which is within the Archdiocese of Washington, began communicating with these and other groups and soon Catholic Charismatic prayer groups began springing up throughout the U.S. and eventually all over the world. The group in Potomac became a catalyst for the start of other new prayer groups within the Washington, D.C. area and in other regions. On March 24, 1971, the budding community was formally incorporated in the state of Maryland under the name Potomac Charismatic Community, Inc. In 1972 the name \\"Mother of God Community\\" was chosen; reflecting the Community members' desire to be like Mary, the Mother of God, who received Christ and became a vessel for sharing his life. The legal name, however, is still Potomac Charismatic Community, Inc. As the group grew to several hundred in number, it required more structure. A pastoral team was formed made up of lay people and priests. Joseph (Joe) Difato, Edith's eldest son, became the coordinator of a small pastoral team. In the mid-1970s, in order to live closer to one another in affordable homes (largely townhouses), members of the Community began to move to the newly built town of Montgomery Village, which adjoins Gaithersburg, Maryland. The first Mother of God Community Covenant was signed by members in 1974. The Community covenant, although revised over time, still includes a commitment to pray daily, to examine one's conscience and repent from sin, to read scripture, to attend prayer meetings regularly, to participate in MOG activities, to love and support one another, to support the Community financially according to one's means, and to do other related matters. Members of the community include married couples, young people, older singles, housewives, priests, and consecrated religious. Most all of the members are Catholic, but Christians from other traditions have always been welcome and each member is expected to attend a Sunday worship service or Mass. Many community members assist their local parish as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, lectors, sacristans, choir members, parish council members, deacons, and other ministries. As in most Catholic Charismatic groups, the primary focal point for the Community has always been the large open praise and worship meeting held weekly. These meetings are times of worship, singing, sharing, and openness to the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit, especially \\"word\\" gifts: prophecy, the word of knowledge, speaking and singing in tongues, etc. Healing prayer and intercessory prayer are also part of these meetings. A teaching or exhortation may also be given at the praise and worship meeting. Past structure From 1974 to 1995 the coordinators of the Community were Edith Difato and Joe Difato. There was a core team of 12 people in leadership positions a number of priests who were living in the community. In the 1970s the Community was divided into three geographic regions (Potomac, Rockville, and Montgomery Village) and later, when most members had moved to Montgomery Village the regions were divided somewhat by age or state in life. Each region had a coordinator. There were also heads of various community ministries and small men and women support groups. At its height in the 1980s Community membership numbered some 500 or more individuals. Community school and property In order to provide a Catholic school for their children, in 1987 community members voted to purchase a wedge-shaped piece of land along Goshen Road on the northern perimeter of Montgomery Village. The Mother of God School opened that fall in an unused public school building in the Aspen Hill area of Montgomery County, Maryland, and two years later the School was transferred to a newly built three-story structure on the purchased property in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The third level of the building was largely devoted to office space and the other two stories housed the classrooms and workspaces of the school, Kindergarten through 12th grade. A few years later a building with four classrooms and large gym with a vaulted ceiling was added to the school. The gym is not only used by the school, but also as a place of worship for a Byzantine Catholic community on Sunday mornings; for the Community‚Äôs weekly praise and worship meeting on Sunday evenings; for conferences; and other activities. The school is open to all children and, although a private Catholic School, it is affiliated with the Archdiocesan School System and now has a sizable pre-K program. At the same time that the school was built there was erected on the property a three story, monastic like residence which contains six apartments, a large chapel, living room, library, and a common kitchen and dining room. The residence, known as ‚ÄúGoshen House‚Äù, is the center for many community gatherings and has been the home of various lay people, priests, and consecrated religious who have felt called to live together. It is a coincidence that the Mother of God Community property is directly across the street from a parish site, St. John Neumann Catholic Church, where most Community members attend weekly Mass. The Word Among Us As the Community grew new methods of evangelisation were explored. The first edition of The Word Among Us, a monthly Christian magazine, was published in December 1981 by members of the Mother of God Community who hand stapled the first copies together. The magazine gradually grew and was eventually translated into several languages and distributed worldwide. The original format of the magazine was simple. It consisted of feature articles and daily meditations based upon the readings of the day in the Catholic Church. Articles and meditations were originally written by members of the Mother of God Community. It also carried, at one time, the Imprimatur from the Archdiocese of Washington which increased its appeal to its predominantly Roman Catholic audience. After the reorganization of the Mother of God Community in 1996, offices were moved to Frederick County, Maryland and into the boundaries of the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Assessment by the Archdiocese From its earliest days the community enjoyed good relations with the Roman Catholic Church and the Archdiocese of Washington. By the early 1990s Mother of God Community began looking into the possibility of the Community being recognized as a Catholic \\"private association of the faithful.\\" Under the guidance of Fr. Theo Rush the Community won provisional recognition from the Archdiocese in 1993. Permanent status required a review of the group's statutes and operations and many Community members volunteered to be on a committee to draft statutes for the governance of the Community. In 1994, under the instructions of Cardinal James A. Hickey, a self-assessment was begun as well as an outside assessment by one of his advisers, Sister Elizabeth McDonough. For the self-assessment Community leaders designed and gave a 135 question survey to its current members and former members were also invited to participate. The results of the survey were overwhelmingly positive. In the survey respondents spoke about the way the life in the community changed their lives, helped their families, and renewed their Catholic faith. For the outside assessment members and former members were invited to speak privately with Sister McDonough. Private meetings with Sister McDonough (which remain anonymous) were not so positive and many members and former members shared stories of overreaching control by community leaders. There were complaints of arranged marriages, over-scrutiny and direction of members' personal, financial and family life, marginalization of non-conforming members, and so on. At the same time, some former members of the Community invited persons associated with Cult Awareness Network to begin meeting with current and former members. At the meetings some alleged that Community leaders had engaged in both financial abuses and in \\"cult-like abuses\\" such as the abuse of authority, groupthink, adulated leadership, elitism, and marginalization of nonconforming members. A comprehensive audit in 1997 did not substantiate allegations of financial abuses, but allegations of \\"cult-like-abuse,\\" due to their anecdotal nature, proved difficult to prove or disprove. However, some members or former members felt that their lives were manipulated in the ways described by the book, Today's Destructive Cults and Movements written by Fr. Lawrence Gesy which had a chapter describing \\"Shepherding/Discipleship\\" movements. Tensions came to a head when, on the evening of Sunday, May 21, 1995, at a Mother of God prayer meeting, Judith Tydings, Edith Difato's co- founder, stood up and related about her own marginalization within the Community and read sections of a letter written by former Community member, Fr Tom Weinandy, which outlined his thoughts on the positive and negative aspects of the community. She recommended that there be new leadership and that an interim body be appointed. Re-organization On Saturday, September 23, 1995, the Archdiocese of Washington announced it wanted to make changes of leadership in Mother of God Community. Cardinal Hickey visited the community, first holding a private meeting with the Difatos and then a public address to several hundred community members. In Cardinal Hickey's public address, he called the Community \\"a gift from the Lord\\" that allowed members \\"to take your faith much more seriously, to grow in your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.\\" However, Hickey raised concerns about the teaching, pastoral practices and leadership of the Community. Firstly, the Cardinal raised concerns about Community teachings, citing that many were too Protestant, or not Catholic enough. However, Mass was celebrated each day in the MOG chapel and the Sacraments of Reconciliation, First Communion, Confirmation and Marriage were administered by the priests of the community. He expressed concern about the Community's teaching especially with regard to baptism in the Spirit and its relationship with the seven sacraments of the Church; the centrality of the Eucharist to Catholic worship rather than just prayer meetings; the authentic Catholic understanding of the essential goodness of creation and the dignity of the human person in that though men are sinners even those who are not yet in the Church are not evil or depraved; the sacrament of marriage and equality of spouses; and some aspects of the Toronto Blessing such as being 'slain in the Spirit' or resting in Spirit which was being practiced by many in the Community at the time. Secondly, he had concerns with the pastoral practices of the Community. Lay people within the Community, he said, had too much personal authority over other people‚Äôs lives. Hickey said that because of Mother of God's pastoral practices, members were led to speak of very personal things in a manner that did not protect their right to privacy and confidentiality and which had the effect of leaving them vulnerable. Furthermore, he requested that anyone who had personal information about other members-\\"in notebooks, in computer files, in whatever form, that you destroy it, lest it be the source of future embarrassment or harm.\\" Lastly, Cardinal Hickey reiterated the request he made in 1993 that the leadership be changed and he appointed some interim leaders who were charged with responsibility to lead the Community until such time as new leaders were formally elected under Community statutes that were finalized and approved by the Archdiocese. After the Cardinal's address, most members left the Community. Some formed a new community outside of the Archdiocese called the Triumph of the Cross. After a while many other Community members also left leaving perhaps 100 members. A year later, on Wednesday, February 14, 1997, a much smaller Mother of God Community, operating under new procedures, a more democratic leadership, won formal approval from the Archdiocese of Washington. Since the Community's restructuring allegations of abuse in the Community have discontinued. Current structure and leadership Mother of God Community (MOG) is recognized within the Archdiocese of Washington as a \\"Private Association of the Faithful.\\" This means religious vows or consecrated life is not required to be a member and affiliation or membership is totally voluntary. This is a canonical designation (under the Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church) which indicates that a religious organization is \\"officially approved\\" for participation by Catholics. The process of obtaining this recognition included the writing of statutes governing the life of the community and the holding of elections for the community leadership. The community is still approved by the Archdiocese of Washington under its current Archbishop Donald Wuerl and is active participant in the meetings and events sponsored by the Association of Ecclesial Movements and New Communities of the Archdiocese of Washington. Under its approved statutes the Mother of God Community is led by its Pastoral Council composed of six members each elected by the covenant members of the Community to a four-year, staggered term with two members coming up for election every two years. The Council elects a Chair who now has the title (and the responsibilities) of Coordinator of the Community. For a number of years the Chair/Coordinator had been noted scripture scholar and consecrated lay woman Dr. Mary Healy, SSL, STL. However, in June 2008, Dr. Healy left her position in the Community to become an assistant professor of Sacred Scripture at Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, Michigan. Hall Miller, a local businessman and longtime member of the Community was then elected Coordinator. In June 2014 Hall Miller stepped down to become full-time President and Principal of the Mother of God School and Tom Singer, another longtime member, was elected as Coordinator in his place. Serving with the Coordinator on the Pastoral Council are five other elected members. Although covenant members, which number less than 100, are the only ones who vote there are probably some 150 other individuals who have affiliate membership or are considered \\"friends\\" of the community and are sent Community e-mails. Priests and scholars associated with the community The Mother of God Community has always attracted numerous priests and scholars as in- resident members for a period of time or as friends or affiliate members. Until his passing in 2017 the Community Chaplain and Spiritual Advisor in- residence was the noted Catholic priest, scholar, author and professor, Fr. Francis Martin (SSL, STD, STL) formerly professor at Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit , the Dominican House of Studies in Washington DC and the John Paul II Institute for Marriage and Family also in DC. His lectures from Mother of God can be found on the Word Proclaimed Institute's website . Other priests who have been members of the Community include Fr. Fred Close, Pastor of St. Anthony of Padua parish in Northeast Washington, D.C. , Fr. Theo Rush, a Franciscan priest and Canon lawyer from Australia; Fr. Peter Hocken, a British priest and noted author/historian about the Charismatic and Pentecostal Renewal; Fr. Thomas Weinandy, Fr. Mike Duggan, Fr. Gerard Beigel, Fr. Steve O'Donnell, and many others. Other scholar friends of the Community include the Jesuit priest, Fr. Peter Ryan (STD), currently professor at Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit and Dr. John Grabowski, Associate Professor of Moral Theology at Catholic University. Mother of God ministries and activities The Mother of God Community website and weekly bulletins list and describe a variety of ministries and activities including the running of the Mother of God School (pre-K thru 8th grade); weekday prayers and Masses; Sunday night praise and worship meetings, women's groups and retreats, men's groups and retreats, children's catechesis, coordinating or facilitating seminars in Life in the Spirit or Christ's Life series, sponsoring or facilitating healing conferences with Damian Stayne from England, hosting Unbound conferences with Neal and Matthew Lozano, and other activities. Members and affiliates members of the Community have also founded ministries or taken leadership roles in ongoing ministries including the Word Proclaimed Institute, Word for Life Rosary Mission, Blessed Hope Communications, St. Paul Street Evangelization, St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Pray for Bethesda pro-life organization, missions to South Sudan and China, sponsoring weekly youth gatherings and helping youths attend the annual Steubenville Youth Conference, and other activities.

Movements I. Allegro moderato A major II. Andante D major III. Allegro A major Well regarded among pianists, the \\"Little\\" A major sonata is so called to distinguish it from the hefty 1828 sonata in the same key. It is the shortest among Schubert's complete sonatas. The manuscript, completed in July 1819, was dedicated to Josephine von Koller of Steyr in Upper Austria, whom he considered to be \\"very pretty\\" and \\"a good pianist\\". The lyrical, buoyant, in spots typically poignant nature of this sonata fits the image of a young Schubert in love, living in a summery Austrian countryside, which he also considered to be \\"unimaginably lovely\\". The A major sonata is straightforward, with a dulcet melodic opening. It was the first of Schubert's piano sonatas where the sonata form as perfected by his idol, Beethoven, does not seem wrestled with; rather, it is a \\"joyous breakthrough\\", a carefree triumph over strict rules of construction. The original manuscript to this \\"little\\" sonata has been lost. Further reading James Webster noted the particular A B A form of the first movement's first thematic group. Daniel Coren summarised the nature of the recapitulations in the first and third movements.

It produces some of the same effects as other benzodiazepines, but is much more selective than most other drugs of this class and so produces somewhat less sedation and ataxia than other related drugs such as diazepam and triazolam, although it still retains anticonvulsant effects. QH-ii-066 is a highly subtype-selective GABAA agonist which was designed to bind selectively to the Œ±5 subtype of GABAA receptors. The Œ±5 subtype (and to a lesser extent the Œ±1 subtype) of GABAA are two of the most important targets in the brain that produce the effects of alcohol, and so one of the purposes for which QH- ii-066 was developed was to reproduce the GABAergic effects of alcohol separately from its other actions. QH-ii-066 replicates some of the effects of alcohol, such as sedation and ataxia, but does not increase appetite, as this effect seems to be produced by the Œ±1 subtype of GABAA rather than Œ±5. The inverse agonist Ro15-4513, which blocks the Œ±5 subtype of GABAA, reverses the effects of alcohol, suggesting that this subtype is also important in producing the subjective effects of alcohol intoxication.

The library was released in version 4.0 of the .NET Framework. It is composed of two parts: Parallel LINQ (PLINQ) and Task Parallel Library (TPL). It also consists of a set of coordination data structures (CDS) ‚Äì sets of data structures used to synchronize and co- ordinate the execution of concurrent tasks. Parallel LINQ PLINQ, or Parallel LINQ, parallelizing the execution of queries on objects (LINQ to Objects) and XML data (LINQ to XML). PLINQ is intended for exposing data parallelism by use of queries. Any computation on objects that has been implemented as queries can be parallelized by PLINQ. However, the objects need to implement the \`IParallelEnumerable\` interface, which is defined by PLINQ itself. Internally it uses TPL for execution. Task Parallel Library The Task Parallel Library (TPL) is the task parallelism component of the Parallel Extensions to .NET. It exposes parallel constructs like parallel \`For\` and \`ForEach\` loops, using regular method calls and delegates, thus the constructs can be used from any CLI languages. The job of spawning and terminating threads, as well as scaling the number of threads according to the number of available processors, is done by the library itself, using a work stealing scheduler. TPL also includes other constructs like Task and Future. A Task is an action that can be executed independent of the rest of the program. In that sense, it is semantically equivalent to a thread, except that it is a more light-weight object and comes without the overhead of creating an OS thread. Tasks are queued by a Task Manager object and are scheduled to run on multiple OS threads in a thread pool when their turn comes. Future is a task that returns a result. The result is computed in a background thread encapsulated by the Future object, and the result is buffered until it is retrieved. If an attempt is made to retrieve the result before it has been computed then the requesting thread will block until the result is available. The other construct of TPL is Parallel class. TPL provides a basic form of structured parallelism via three static methods in the Parallel class: ;Parallel.Invoke: Executes an array of Action delegates in parallel, and then waits for them to complete ;Parallel.For: Parallel equivalent of a C# for loop ;Parallel.ForEach: Parallel equivalent of a C# foreach loop Architecture The main concept in the Parallel Extensions to .NET is a \`Task\`, which is a small unit of code, usually represented as a lambda function, that can be executed independently. Both PLINQ and the TPL API provides methods to create the Tasks - PLINQ divides a query into smaller Tasks, and the \`Parallel.For\`, \`Parallel.ForEach\` and \`Parallel.Invoke\` methods divide a loop into Tasks. PFX includes a \`Task Manager\` object which schedules the Tasks for execution. A Task Manager contains a global queue of Tasks, which are then executed. It also encapsulates multiple threads onto which the Tasks are executed. By default, as many threads as there are processors (or processor cores) on the system are created, though this number may be manually modified. Each thread is associated with a thread-specific queue of Tasks. When idle, each thread picks up a batch of Tasks and puts them on its local queue, where they are then executed, one by one. If the global queue is empty, a thread will look for Tasks in the queues of its peers, and will take the Tasks which have been in the queue the longest (task stealing). When in execution, the Tasks will be executed independently, with the change in state of one Task independent of others. As a result, if they use a shared resource, they still need to be synchronized manually using locks or other constructs.

There were nine colleges in Marathwada, listed below, all affiliated with Osmania University at Hyderabad in current Andhra Pradesh state. In response to demand of the public in Marathwada region for a university, the government appointed on 27 April 1957 a committee with the charter to provide recommendations regarding establishment of such a university. The governor of Bombay state signed the Marathwada University Act on 5 May 1958. Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, inaugurated Marathwada University on 23 August 1958 at Aurangabad on the premises of the temporary main building of the university. S.R.

The parish church is a grade II listed building. It is traditionally the centre of the parish of West Ardsley, but Tingley is now a much larger settlement. Woodkirk was part of the Ardsley urban district 1894‚Äì1937, which also included West Ardsley and East Ardsley and was then part of Morley municipal borough 1937‚Äì1974. The village once formed part of the former municipal borough of Morley, and is still classed as part of Morley in the census. However, it is technically separate, and is not governed by Morley Town Council. Woodkirk is in the Leeds City Council ward, Morley South, each electing three councillors to Leeds City Council. It is in the Morley and Outwood parliamentary constituency. Woodkirk is just within the boundaries of the City of Leeds although Woodkirk Post Office is in Kirklees. Woodkirk contains a high school and sixth form: Woodkirk High Specialist Science School. The school opened in the late 1940s and now has over 2,000 students. The Leeds Country Way passes through the churchyard.  Railway past  Woodkirk was once served by its own railway station, which closed to passengers around 1939, right at the very start of World War II, but the line, which once passed by, continued a further 25 years until its final closure, in 1964. However, the former station site, in Woodkirk itself, still stands though it is now derelict and disused, like the Soothill Tunnel.

Marsden statue at the South end of the Meanwood Valley Trail Signpost on the Meanwood Valley Trail (Section 3) Footbridge over Meanwood Beck, Section 5 Woods in Section 6 Seven Arches Aqueduct, Section 8 Slabbering Baby well, section 9 Sign at Breary Marsh at the North end of the Meanwood Valley Trail The Meanwood Valley Trail is a waymarked footpath and the title of an annual (March/April) footrace that takes place on parts of the trail in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It runs for a distance of from the statue of (former Leeds mayor) Henry Rowland Marsden, 1878, on Woodhouse Moor, close to the University of Leeds, through Headingley, Meanwood and Adel to Breary Marsh, Golden Acre Park, where it meets the Leeds Country Way. For most of its route (to King Lane) it is the official Leeds link to the Dales Way. Along the way are signs giving information about the local wildlife. Some of the upper reaches of the trail are used for an annual trail running race each March/April, organised by local running club the Valley Striders. This race has over 300 participants each year and is part of the Airedale Triple, which also includes the Baildon Boundary Way and the Guiseley Gallop. Route The path is waymarked in both directions and can be started at any point, but is described here Northwards from the Marsden Statue on Woodhouse Moor divided into parts and sections which correspond with the old edition of the official map a new one which includes minor route changes was produced in 2013.Meanwood Valley Trail new trailmap/leaflet produced 2013 http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/MVT%20leaflet%20for%20web.pdf Stage 1 - Woodhouse Moor to Meanwood Beck Section 1: At the junction of Woodhouse Lane and Raglan Road, the statue of Henry Marsden is visible 100 m NNW. By this is a map sign (currently vandalised) and an arrow pointing to Raglan Road. Follow Raglan Road north to junction with Rampart Road, turn right, continue over crossroads and head up Delph Lane.Note: not on the leaflet, but right off Rampart Road down Holborn Approach within 200 m are two interesting buildings. About 100 m on the right is a pub The Bricklayers Arms and 200 m down is the 1850 Temperance Hall. Section 2: At the end of Delph Lane turn left on a footpath. You are now on Woodhouse Ridge. Follow the top path keeping the stone wall to your left. At a metal gate, go down the steps ahead and bear right on the path until you come to Meanwood Beck. Turn left (with the stream on your right) until you leave the Ridge and cross a main road, Grove Lane. Section 3: The footpath continues behind some back gardens on your left to another road, Monkbridge Road. Cross over turning right, and take the first left, Mill Pond Lane, then take the footpath immediately to the left. After a bridge over Meanwood Beck, turn right for approx 50 metres then turn left, following the path round the millpond, which served the former Meanwood Tannery, now converted to residential flats. The path goes sharp right through some allotments, then reaches housing and just before reaching the road at Hollin Drive turn right to cross Meanwood Beck at a waymarker post. You pass the disused cricket ground of Highbury CC on your right and turn left on a small bridge over the Beck to enter the picnic area of Meanwood Park. Stage 2 - Meanwood Park to the Outer Ring Road Section 5: Keep to the right hand side of Meanwood Beck (though you can cross and re-cross the many little bridges) going upstream and north until you pass through an arch in a stone wall. (If you take the left side of the Beck, there is a big stone arched bridge just before this point.) Turn left across a wooden bridge, then right into woods. The Hollies Section 6: Follow this path over a weir. (If you want a detour go left over small bridges and uphill to gardens known as The Hollies.) Then cross a bridge over a larger weir, then bear left, passing through a gateway and following the Beck until the path reaches Parkside Road. Stage 3 - Ring Road to Stairfoot Lane Section 7: Turn left and cross the road. Follow it almost to the Ring Road. There is a footpath on the right which eventually runs to a tunnel under the Ring Road. Coming out of this, turn right up some steps and follow the path with the Beck on your right, entering Scotland Woods. Turn right to cross the Beck over the stone remains of Scotland Mill's dam. (Note: as an alternative, at the junction to turn right, you could keep left and simply follow the high route until reaching the Seven Arches Aqueduct) Section 8:As of July 2009 sections 7 and 8 are not well signed and there are numerous paths through the woods in different directions. Once over the beck turn right for approx 100 metres uphill to reach a wide track and turn left to follow the high path through the woods. Pass under the Seven Arches Aqueduct (built 1840, but disused) and bear right through Adel Woods keeping to the higher path with the beck (now Adel Beck) to your left. Adel Crag Section 9: There is a carved water spout known as the \\"Slabbering Baby\\" on the right.This is now overgrown with moss and the carvings are indistinguishable and water no longer runs through it. It probably dates from the mid-1800s. Just after this, cross a second beck and go up a slope with a small pond on the left and immediately beyond this follow a (waymarked) path bearing to the right which leads to a car park off Stairfoot Lane (keep an eye out for the waymarker arrows that are painted on trees/rocks to indicate the correct way). (Another slight detour: follow the main path from the car park about 100 m into the woods then a path on the left another 100 m leads to large stones known as Adel Crag.) Stage 4 - Stairfoot Lane to Golden Acre Park Section 10: Cross Stairfoot Lane and join a bridleway opposite the car park, continue along the obvious path as it rises uphill avoiding any deviations to reach a waymarker post indicating bridleway directions. At this point the old gateway is long since missing (and the stile to the right inevitably unused). Go through the gap and enter the grassy field to follow the field edge on your right to reach a wide, tree/bush lined track (with Headingley Golf Course on your left) to reach King Lane at Golf Farm. Cross the road and turn left following King Lane. Do not walk the main road (it can be very busy), instead take the obvious path that uses the road verge. Section 11: At a junction of 5 roads, carry on ahead (with the narrow woodland briefly on your right), again following the verge path up King Lane. At the next junction a gate ahead across the road leads into Golden Acre Park. Follow the path to reach the lake and go either left or right around the lake to reach an underpass which goes under the Otley Road. You will find yourself on raised wooded paths over Breary Marsh, and the end of the trail. The Golden Acre car park is immediately adjacent, and the main Otley Road has bus services to Leeds, Otley, Ilkley or Skipton (the latter Mon-Sat). To the north west of the main lake there are toilets & a cafe.

He was born in Derryhennett, County Armagh, Northern Ireland; however, he immigrated to New Zealand at 13 years of age.  Racing career  Hawthorne had started racing in the mid-to-late 1960s with a Ford Anglia. After moving to Europe to work as a racing mechanic at Ron Tauranac's Brabham factory. He planned to bring home a competitive race car which he could use. He then built a Brabham BT21 and had it shipped back to New Zealand. He returned to New Zealand himself and raced in the National Formula category for twin-cam, 1600 cm3 engines. He came close to a man named Allan McCall, who was impressed with Hawthorne's race talent. Hawthorne then went over to the United Kingdom again, this time to race, in Formula 3 with a limited budget. Soon after, he went over to the USA, to race in the North American Formula B/Atlantic Championship, which turned out to be very successful, becoming the vice-champion of the series in 1971. In 1972 Hawthorne won the Bogota Grand Prix, giving the Brabham BT38 its maiden victory. However he did not continue with Brabham, and decided to link up again with McCall, who was developing Formula 2, under the banner Leda Engineering. Hawthorne's first Formula 2 race was the Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy in Thruxton, which was a round of both the British and European Formula 2 Championships. Hawthorne won a heat race, and in the final race was putting on an impressive display, until he retired on lap 38 with a fuel pickup problem.  Death  A memorial plate on the place of Bert Hawthorne's deathHawthorne was killed on 14 April 1972 in the following round of the European Championship, the Jim Clark Memorial Race at Hockenheim. Bert was driving Allan McCall's TUI car. He was racing with German driver Bernd Terbeck when Hawthorne's car slowed. Terbeck could not swerve and hit Hawthorne at speed, pitching it head-on against the barriers. His car skidded along the guard-rail, pulling out security uprights. It came to rest on fire. At the track, it was known that both Terbeck and Hawthorne were missing, but the incident wasn't known till two laps later, when Niki Lauda pulled in to the pits. He then asked why nothing was apparently being done about a car on fire on the circuit. It was later confirmed that Hawthorne had been killed instantly from serious head injuries.http://www.motorsportmemorial.org/focus.php?db=ct&n;=1237 Motorsport Memorial Page References Category:1944 births Category:1972 deaths Category:New Zealand racing drivers Category:Racing drivers killed while racing Category:Sport deaths in Germany Category:New Zealand people of Irish descent Category:People from County Armagh Category:Tasman Series drivers ","title":"Bert Hawthorne"},{"id":"13353833","text":"Waterfall (sometimes referred to on timetables as \\"Waterfalls\\") was the only intermediate station on the Foxdale Railway on the Isle of Man.

It takes its name from Eboracum, the Roman name for York. Helmsley Castle is near a trail head on the Ebor Way This walk connects the Cleveland Way and Dales Way running through the low- lying vale of York. The trail runs via Tadcaster and Wetherby. It was first developed in the 1970s by the Ebor Acorn Rambling Club. From Helmsley, the walk heads south via Oswaldkirk, Cawton and Hovingham to Terrington. Here it is joined by the Centenary Way, which follows a broadly similar route to York, although the two diverge at times. From Terrington, it continues south to Sheriff Hutton and Strensall, then runs alongside the River Foss to the centre of York. Passing York Minster, it skirts round the north and west sides of the city walls before leaving the city on the west bank of the River Ouse. Turning west away from the river, the path goes through the satellite villages of Bishopthorpe and Copmanthorpe before picking up the route of the old Roman road between Eboracum and Calcaria. Where the route crosses the A64, walkers may be well advised to use the new bridge at Bilbrough Top and walk along the northern side of the road rather than sticking faithfully to the route, as this avoids a dangerous road crossing. The path then continues to follow the route of the Roman road into Tadcaster. From Tadcaster, the path largely follows the banks of the River Wharfe through Boston Spa, with deviations away from the river bank through Newton Kyme and Thorp Arch. From Wetherby, the path heads south through Linton, then meanders westwards before crossing the River Wharfe, and running along the south side of it to Harewood. A few miles after passing through the grounds of Harewood House, the route is joined by the Dales Way, and from here on they take mostly the same route with only minor variances. The route continues through Bramhope and The Chevin before dropping into Menston, and then climbing up to Ilkley Moor for the wildest part of the route. After following the edge of the moor, the route descends via the Cow and Calf rocks, before coming to its end in the centre of Ilkley.

Vinkeles and C. Bogerts Coert or Court Lambertus van Beyma (Harlingen, 5 February 1753 - Dronrijp, 7 September 1820), son of Julius Matthijs van Beyma and Fokel Helena van Burmania, was a public notary and auctioneer, delegate and representative of the Frisian States, leader of the Frisian patriots. He was the initiator of a Frisian coup and spent time in exile in northern France. On his return to the Netherlands in 1795, he became a delegate to the National Assembly of the newly established Batavian Republic. Life His father had been Secretary to the Admiralty of Friesland in Harlingen, and his mother equally descended from a Frisian noble grietman family. As a law student, Van Beyma gave a speech in 1769 during the visit of stadholder William V to Franeker. He continued his studies in 1774 at Leiden University. Court Lambertus became a delegate to the Frisian States in 1776. In 1780, he however failed to become the grietman of West-Dongeradeel, though he did achieve the position of Secretary. In that capacity, he corresponded with Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol. Together they planned petitions for the built-up of a provincial army, the recognition of the new United States of America and to restrict the power of the stadhouder. In February 1782 Van Beyma undertook an attempt in the Frisian States to put into practice article VIII of the Union of Utrecht, which would effectively allow for a general arming of the population.H. Spanninga (1987) Beginsel en belang bij C.L. van Beyma, p. 35. In: For uwz l√¢n, wyv en bern. De patriottentijd in Friesland. Onder redactie van W. Bergsma, C. Boschma, M.G. Buist en H. Spanninga. When Van Beyma in 1783 achieved a successful alliance between eight Frisian cities, the Patriots gained further influence and power.In the resolutions of the Vroedschap of Bolsward, dated 29 November 1782 and 15 May 1783, and in the Convention of Dokkum of 27 June 1783, the power of the stadholder was being limited . Through the development of a fixed time- table schedule, the important posts within the Provincial States were subsequently attributed in a more democratic manner. A provincial army, established a few months after the Kettle War and the subsequent departure of Ludwig Ernst van Brunswick-L√ºneburg-Bevern in 1784/85, lead to strong resistance among the aristocracy. Most aristocrats were republican, but with little sympathy for the democratising movement. The Frisian States were increasingly divided over the newly formed local and provincial militia. Within a few weeks of the stadholder and his family visiting Leeuwarden, a new city council regulation was introduced, which came into effect on 1 June 1787, providing stricter requirements for the election of new members of the vroedschap (i.e. banning Catholics, Mennonites and poor Patriots from being appointed).Tegenwoordige Staat van Friesland (1789), deel IV, p. 709. Utrecht Early August 1786, Van Beyma, J. Roorda, A.C.J. de Beere, Cornelis van den Burg and J. L. Huber attended a national meeting of the vrijcorpsen and exercitiegenootschappen in Utrecht, 'only to hear and to see'. The Utrecht Patriots made skillful use of the presence of more than 13,000 of its members and of many important public figures. Present among them were H.W. Daendels, still a young lawyer from Hattem, but also Gerrit Paape, the journalist from Delft, Pieter Vreede, a textile manufacturer from Leiden, and John Adams, the American envoy at the time. On Wednesday morning, 2 August 1786, in the presence of the assembled exercitiegenootschappen, sixteen \\"democratically\\" chosen Patriots were elected to the Utrecht vroedschap. Van Beyma left the next day and handed over the presidency to Jacob van Manen, secretary of the Utrecht vrijcorps.Algemeen Rijksarchief 2.21.057, archief P.A. Dumont-Pigalle, inv. nr. 87: Handelingen en Besluiten van de Algemeene Vergadering der Gewapende Burger-Corpzen Provintialiter gehouden binnen Utrecht op den 1 Augustus 1786 en volgende dagen; H.T. Colenbrander (1898) De patriottentijd. Hoofdzakelijk naar buitenlandsche bescheiden. Deel II 1784-1796, p. 255 Probably Van Beyma, who - according to advertisements in the \\"Leeuwarder Courant\\" from those days - led weekly public auctions, no longer could or wanted to be present in person at the parades and celebrations. Franeker Mid August 1787, Friesland's disavow of Holland, which was threatened with an occupation by a Prussian army of 26.000 because it had refused to apologize after the apprehension of Wilhelmina of Prussia, lead to a crisis. Van Beyma subsequently led a coup against the Frisian States out of Franeker, a local University town. Franeker was put in a state of defence and the coup leaders organized the supply of a wagon-train with munitions via Makkum, a small port. A flying-column of volunteers occupied a number of the Frisian cities, putting their internally divided vroedschappen under pressure to recognize the so-called Pretense Staten in Franeker. On the approach of the Prussian troops, Van Beyma panicked and threatened to breach the dike near Lemmer, so that the Prussians would be halted by the resulting floodings. On Sunday, September 23, 1787 - after the religious service - the Patriots in Friesland however came to realize that there had been insufficient support, that their financial means were limited, and that France would not come to their aid, as hoped for. They therefore fled and retreated to Amsterdam and Northern France. As a consequence of their hurried retreat, either Van Beyma, or his secretary Van Altena, left behind a bundle of important and highly compromising petitions concerning the recovery of rights and freedoms. Thus, two years later it became very easy for a court to convict the leading group of Patriots from Friesland (19 from Franeker, 12 from Bolsward and two from Leeuwarden). Johan Valckenaer, the ex-professor from Franeker, who had been van Beyma's travelling-companion between Amsterdam and Brussels, took van Beyma's carelessness very hard.Roosendaal, J. (2003) Bataven! Nederlandse vluchtelingen in Frankrijk 1787-1795, p. 217. Saint-Omer On 15 May 1791 van Beyma held a speech in the Jacobin club and asked the French for support.https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6222604k/f1n48.pdf?download=1 After his visit to Paris, Van Beyma was put in charge of the management of the payments to the Patriots in northern France, but another quarrel arose with Valckenaer. The exiles, divided into 'Valckenaerists' and 'Beymanists', fought it out through pamphlets. The dispute reached a climax in 1791, with Valckenaer - still not getting payment from Van Beyma - considering emigrating to the USA but in the end won the support of the Patriots who had been members of the former political establishment. The Batavian Republic Between the summer of 1795 and early 1796 van Beyma was not politically active but he returned to the political scene when the new National representatives were elected, winning five out of eleven districts. As Secretary to the First National Assemblee he turned out, however, to be mainly preoccupied with indemnity claims and taking vengeance over his old adversaries, the former regents. In a subsequent fight between the Federalists (to which van Beyma belonged) and the more centrally-oriented Unitarists in December 1797, the first fraction lost and van Beyma was removed from his function and effectively detained. After his release on August 22, 1798, he obtained the position of 'Advokaat-fiscaal' at the former Admiralty of Friesland in Harlingen, which he kept until 1806. He died at his house Schatzenburg in Dronrijp on September 7, 1820. Further reading * Kuiper, J. (2002) Een revolutie ontrafeld. Politiek in Friesland 1795-1798. * Schama, S.

It was close to Tynwald Hill.  Origins  The station began life in 1873 as the penultimate stop on the Peel Line, the island's first passenger railway line; it consisted of a simple wooden waiting shelter with accommodation for the station master, and a passing loop. This layout remained until the arrival of the new line from the north in 1879 when a second station was established, later merging with the existing one.  Significance  The station was the hub of the island's railway network, where the lines to Douglas, Peel, Ramsey and Foxdale met. There were three stations within the area (see below) but only the original 1873 station serving the Peel line remained in use until the closure of this part of the network, with the Foxdale line station remaining in a derelict condition until the closure of the network. The station gained the nickname \\"The Manx Crewe\\" owing to the amount of traffic.  George Albert Crellin  Born 2 November 1897, for many years the station master was George Albert Crellin, a well-known figure on the railway who latterly bought and lived with his wife Olga Evelyn Crellin (n√©e Leece), in the original station house for the Foxdale line, which ceased to be used after the amalgamation. He features on many later photographs of the station and was a helpful figure who used to travel to the small signal cabin, or more accurately, point box, on his bicycle. He was the last station master, retiring in the final year, 1968. In retirement he still had an active involvement with the railway until his death on 24 February 1974  Three stations  Manx Northern Railway Co. Douglas - St John's - Peel The original station had a simple building, north of the running line, to the same design as Crosby, a passing loop, goods siding and water tower. The MNR main line ran parallel to the Peel line for some distance west of the station before turning northwest. St John's - Ramsey The MNR line between Ramsey and St John's opened on 23 September 1879 and was operated by the IMR for its first eleven months. With the creation of a connection between the two railways, the 1873 station building was relocated south of the running lines,. A loop was installed on the site, and a small signal box - usually referred to as 'The Point Box' - containing a ten-lever Stevens and Co. frame was erected at the east end of the station to control the operating junction between the MNR and IMR. However, with the end of the working agreement with the IMR, the MNR established a simple station to the west of the level crossing at the Peel end of the IMR station. This was replaced in 1884 with a new station on the alignment of the Foxdale Railway, which was then under construction. For the next 15 years, MNR trains terminated at the \\"new\\" station, and only through carriages and goods traffic used the link between the IMR and MNR stations. However, the advent of the coastal electric railway from Douglas to Ramsey in 1899 caused the MNR to seek better through connections with the IMR. A new platform was constructed on the site of the original MNR station, with trains calling there for local traffic as well as at the IMR station on their way to/from Douglas. The site of this early station was cleared and eventually became the turntable road (see below). The IMR station expanded further in 1905 with the erection of a carriage shed. St John's - Foxdale In 1886 the Foxdale Railway arrived and operated its trains to/from the MNR's 1884 \\"New\\" station which was a short distance north of IMR station on the west side of the road. On paper at least, some MNR trains ran through from Ramsey to Foxdale, but this arrangement may have ceased quite early on, and the service between St John's and Foxdale was usually handled by the Foxdale Coach (MNR 17; later MNR 15, and eventually F39) with a second carriage being added on busy days. It also catered for Ramsey-Douglas through services: through carriages between Ramsey and Douglas were detached from the MNR train and transferred between the two stations. From the 1884 station, the Foxdale line looped around the back (north side) of the IMR station and crossed the Peel line. The bridge that carried the Foxdale Railway over the IMR remains in place at the eastern end of the site. After amalgamation At one time there was a footbridge, but photographs show passengers still crossing the running lines (the platforms were very shallow) and by 1944 the bridge had been removed. The lines to Peel and Ramsey ran alongside each other as they left the station and trains often \\"raced\\" out of the station, even though timetables dictated they should not do so. The MNR station lost most of its passenger traffic after the Isle of Man Railway took over operation of the other two lines in 1905; it was used only for Foxdale services until 1927, after which all Foxdale services passed through and then reversed into the IMR station. These services were never very profitable and ended during 1943. The station building was converted into a house for the St John's stationmaster in 1906. The former Foxdale Railway station closed completely in 1960 at the same time as the Foxdale line. Latterly, disused rolling stock was stored in the station. The station building survives as a private dwelling.  Peak use  No. 11 Maitland (1967) The station often had busy periods, and was the hub of the railway network, although workshop and maintenance facilities were at Douglas Station. Services from Douglas to Ramsey and Peel often arrived as a single train, which was divided at the eastern end of the station prior to entering the station for passengers to board and alight. Two locomotives would often double head this far, the first (or \\"pilot\\" locomotive) drawing forward into the platform whilst the second drew its portion forward onto the relevant platform, and the pilot then ran back to collect its coaches. Douglas services from Peel and Ramsey were often scheduled to join at the station. Thus all three platform faces could be occupied at the same time. Prior to 1940 trains also served Foxdale, but a separate station served this line. The busiest day was Tynwald Day, when it was common to see the majority of the railway's rolling stock in service bringing passengers to the outdoor parliament ceremony, which took place a short walk from the station. For this occasion the railway operated a special unique timetable: trains often ran from dawn until well after midnight to cope with demand, and train movements were frequent throughout the day. It was common for all carriages to be in use and not unheard of for passengers to travel in open cattle vans and wagons and withdrawn carriages. Since closure the station site has been used for car parking for the ceremony.  Features  right From , the station was the site of the sole turntable on the network. It was purchased from the West Clare Railway in Ireland, after that company had been unable to accept delivery from the manufacturers Ransomes & Rapier Ltd of Ipswich. It was used to turn carriages to equalise weathering and wheel wear and tear. Use for turning of locomotives was not documented, and they usually ran \\"bunker first\\" towards Douglas. In the earliest years of the railway locomotives were turned to be chimney first towards Douglas if outstationed at Peel, Port Erin or Ramsey, but this practice was abandoned in the early years of the twentieth century. The turntable was removed in 1961 and stored at Douglas with the intention of using it to turn the recently acquired diesel railcars. This scheme never came to fruition and the turntable was moved to Ballasalla Station in 1974 and scrapped shortly thereafter. When the Marquess of Ailsa took over the line in 1967 a display of disused locomotives was created at the station. After services ceased in 1968 the carriage shed was used to store surplus rolling stock which was moved back to Douglas for use on the south line as required. In 1975 there were two disastrous fires in the shed, and much historic stock was lost. After this the site was used for storing rails as the track was dismantled, and cleared by the late 1970s to become a car park. There was a gravel siding at one time at the eastern end of the station beyond the Foxdale line overbridge, which used temporary Jubilee rail and operated on 2' 0\\" gauge independently of the railway, although a siding to access this was installed.  Today  A new primary school has been built on the site, opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003, but the site remains accessible for a train should the services be reintroduced. The station would have to be downsized and/or relocated.

Biography  Koningen was born to a Norwegian mother and Dutch father during the war whilst his father was stationed in Oslo, working with the Dutch underground. Koningen spent his early childhood in Amsterdam where his introduction to art began with visits to see the Dutch masters at the Rijksmuseum. Koningen's parents moved to Australia in the late 1950s where he excelled at swimming. He studied art and industrial design at the Geelong's Gordon Institute of Technology.

Description The island was declared a nature reserve in 1969 ) managed by the Department of Environment and Conservation; its reserve number is 27614. The island is also registered as a national estate. The island is in area, in length, and at its widest part. The closest island is Michaelmas Island, located north of Breaksea Island. History The island was named by George Vancouver during his expedition in 1791. While in the area he also took possession of the lands for England. He named the island after its beaten appearance and the protection it offered to the landward side from the south-westerly winds. In early April 1827, the island was visited by Major Edmund Lockyer, who found that the island, which had been previously assumed to be bare rock, actually featured between eight and ten acres of soil. He also noted the presence of seals, little penguins, sooty petrels, quail and bronze-winged pigeons.  Lighthouse  A lighthouse was built on the island in 1858 by English convicts using pre-made cast iron sheeting.

Description The station opened to traffic on and was provided with an imposing station building, an Italianate one-storey structure unlike any other railway building on the island. It was accompanied by a stone-built locomotive shed and workshop, corrugated iron carriage shed, water tower and various stone-built goods sheds and warehouses. The station befitted its status as the headquarters of the railway company, but after the merger in 1905 with the Isle of Man Railway Company the interior of the main station was modified, the office space being surplus to requirements: all administration was undertaken at Douglas Station from then on. The station had its own separate ladies' and gentlemen's waiting rooms and refreshments facilities, although the latter closed relatively early in the line's history. The workshop behind the engine shed was also closed and stripped of its equipment around 1905. The station closed to passengers on but certain freight services operated the following year. Extensions At one time there was a branch that spurred off from the northern edge of the station and passed behind the carriage shed and the goods yard and on to the harbour side, terminating near the market square. This branch was used exclusively for wagons carrying ore from Foxdale Mines to ships for transport to Great Britain and Ireland, and ran parallel to the road; at one time it stretched as far as the site of today's Ellan Vannin public house at the far corner of the square. The extension was positioned directly along the quayside, making it convenient for direct loading and unloading onto boats. During the 1930s it was in decline, though sections of rail remained in situ for a number of years after that. In 1988 a commemorative stamp featuring an artist's impression of a train on this extension was issued by the Isle of Man Post Office as part of a set showing old railway and tramway views of the island. There was a further extension to the south-west of the station at Milntown; this was installed in the railway's last year of operation in 1968 in an effort to increase rail traffic. Limited non-passenger services continued into 1969 when trains ran to collect oil wagons for delivery to Douglas; these were the very last services on this line. Decline right The station was located on the outer edges of the town, and even on the railway's busiest days it would often appear to be deserted; in later years the station's wooden canopy, which adjoined the building, developed a distinct sag, and the buildings took on a somewhat abandoned appearance. Passenger services declined rapidly in the 1950s and became seasonal in 1960. Even at the height of the summer season, there were only two or three return workings between Ramsey and St John's and Douglas. By the 1960s goods traffic centred on the cattle dock, which ran along the northern edge of the station alongside the Sulby River and was still in frequent use. The complete closure of the Isle of Man Railway from November 1965 to June 1967 meant that movement of cattle ceased at that time. The local cattle mart was the busiest on the island, and provided much traffic for the railway, giving it some of its longest dedicated goods trains. Like most Manx stations, it never had full-sized platforms, but there were half-height ones reaching as far as the bottom running board of the coaches. On the south side of the main platform there was also a long bay platform. In common with most of the island's railway system, points and signals were not fully interlocked, but controlled by individual hand levers. Therefore there was no signal box or groundframe. After closure, the station remained largely intact, but the rails were lifted in 1975 for scrap and the whole site flattened in 1978 to make way for what is now Ramsey Bakery, making the site almost unrecognisable today although the road on which the bakery now stands is still known as Station Road. A calendar and set of postcards were issued in 2010 featuring watercolour views of the station and its environs, accompanied by a book by local artist Michael Starkey with historical information by Julian Edwards. Services Under the original Manx Northern Railway operations, trains ran to St. John's, where there was a junction with the Isle of Man Railway's Peel to Douglas line. Some trains continued on to Douglas by agreement with the other company, and by 1888 when the northern company was struggling financially, the larger company took responsibility for all operational activities, ultimately taking over the whole line in 1905. Owing to the close proximity of the railway-owned Glen Wyllin Pleasure Grounds some services terminated at Kirk Michael from here. After the merger, through services to Douglas and stations on the south line were offered. During the wars the north line was busy with troop carrying trains which started from here.

Early history The line was built and operated by Westinghouse, Church, Kerr & Company, who organized the company with local promoters.Street Railway Journal (1902) p. 9 The Westinghouse group was a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company. In addition to the GRGH&M;, Westinghouse, Church Kerr and Co. owned the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad and was building that line at the same time. In September 1902, the company was granted franchise to build and operate in Michigan and to purchase the Grand Haven Railway to access Lake Michigan. The GRGH&M; operated on private right of way between Grand Rapids and Muskegon Heights, Michigan. In the cities of Grand Rapids and Muskegon, the line used the tracks of the local street railway systems. A branch line ran from Grand Haven Junction, just east of Fruitport, Michigan, to Grand Haven, where the line had its port connection. Between cities, cars took electricity from a third rail; in towns and cities, power was received through overhead wires. Power was generated by the Muskegon & Grand Rapids Water Power Co. via a generating station on the Muskegon River. Although the main purpose of the GRGH&M; was carrying passengers and express packages between the major and minor cities on its route, a boat connection between Grand Haven and Chicago was a key feature. The Chicago connection allowed the line build a significant business bringing passengers to West Michigan resorts and fresh produce to Chicago markets.Chicago Electric Railfan's Association (1959) p. IV-27 The United Light & Railways years Rumors surfaced in 1911 that the railway was in talks with the Clark syndicate of Philadelphia surrounding a lease of the line; however these rumors were denied by Wallace Franklin, then secretary-treasurer of the company, although at the same time he verified \\"that our line may be sold very soon\\" to another party. In 1912, Westinghouse, Church Kerr & Co. sold the line to the United Light and Railways Company (UL&R;), a Grand Rapids utilities holding company. Under UL&R; ownership, traffic continued to grow through the 1910s. By 1920, the business environment was beginning to change. Private automobiles and paved highways were poised to cut into both passenger and freight traffic. And operating costs, which rose rapidly during WW I threatened to squeeze profits. Still, the \\"Lake Line\\", as the GRGH&M; was called, managed to remain profitable during the early 1920s. Of all the operating interurban lines in Michigan, the GRGH&M;, was the only one not in the hands of a receiver in 1925.Chicago Electric Railfan's Association (1959) p. IV-27. The decline and end After 1925, the fortunes of the GRGH&M; changed quickly. Ridership declined dramatically, and profits plunged. United Light and Power transferred ownership once again, spinning the company off to a group of local managers. There was little the new owners could do. With insufficient funds on hand to pay the bondholders, the Grand Rapids, Grand Haven and Muskegon filed for bankruptcy protection in July 1926. Cars continued to run on a reduced schedule until April 18, 1928, when the line was officially abandoned, and the passenger services were replaced by Greyhound Lines buses. One of the railway's original substations, Grand Rapids, Grand Haven and Muskegon Railway Depot, and a passenger car have been preserved by the Coopersville Area Historical Museum in Coopersville, Michigan.

She was originally the Newfoundland sealing steamer Beothic and was renamed after Russian Captain and Polar explorer Georgy Yakovlevich Sedov. This icebreaker became famous as the first Soviet drifting ice station. In 1929 icebreaker Sedov went on the \\"High-latitude Government Expedition\\" to Franz- Josef Land carrying Soviet scientists. In the summer of 1937 icebreaker Sadko sailed from Murmansk. Its original goal was to sail to Henrietta, Zhokhow and Jeanette Islands, in the De Long group and carry out scientific research. The purpose of the expedition was to find out if the Northern Sea Route could be used for regular shipping and to explore the complex Nordenski√∂ld Archipelago. The Soviet naval authorities changed the plans and the ice-breaker was sent instead to help ships in distress in the Kara and Laptev Seas. The Sadko became trapped in fast ice at 75¬∞17'N and 132¬∞28'E in the region of the New Siberian Islands. Another two Soviet icebreakers, the Sedov and the Malygin which were in the same area researching the ice conditions, became trapped by sea ice as well and drifted helplessly. Owing to persistent bad weather conditions, part of the stranded crew and some of the scientists could only be rescued in April 1938. Only on August 28, 1938, could ice-breaker Yermak free two of the three ships at 83¬∞4'N and 138¬∞22'E. The third ship, the Sedov, had to be left to drift in the ice and was transformed into a scientific polar station. The Sedov kept drifting northwards in the ice towards the Pole, very much like Fridtjof Nansen's Fram had done in 1893-96. There were 15 crew aboard, led by Captain Konstantin Badygin and W. Kh. Buinitzki. The scientists aboard took 415 astronomical measurements, 78 electromagnetic observations, as well as 38 depth measurements by drilling the thick polar ice during their 812-day stay aboard the Sedov. They were freed between Greenland and Svalbard by the icebreaker Joseph Stalin, the biggest icebreaker of the Soviet fleet at that time, on January 18, 1940.

See also other chapters in the same book: \\"Framing and the cognitive miser\\" (chapter 7); \\"A different pitfall of the cognitive miser: thinking a lot, but losing\\" (chapter 9). Just as a miser seeks to avoid spending money, the human mind often seeks to avoid spending cognitive effort. The cognitive miser theory is an umbrella theory of cognition that brings together previous research on heuristics and attributional biases to explain how and why people are cognitive misers. The term cognitive miser was first introduced by Susan Fiske and Shelley Taylor in 1984. It is an important concept in social cognition theory and has been influential in other social sciences including but not exclusive to economics and political science. > ‚ÄúPeople are limited in their capacity to process information, so they take > shortcuts whenever they can.‚Äù  Assumption  The metaphor of the cognitive miser assumes that the human mind is rather limited in time, knowledge, attention, and cognitive resources.Simon, H. A. (1956). Rational choice and the structure of the environment. Psychological review, 63(2), 129. Usually people do not think rationally or cautiously, but use cognitive shortcuts to make inferences and form judgments. These shortcuts include the use of schemas, scripts, stereotypes, and other simplified perceptual strategies instead of careful thinking. For example, people tend to make correspondent reasoning and are likely to believe that behaviors should be correlated to or representative of stable characteristics.Jones, E. E., & Davis, K. E. (1965). From acts to dispositions the attribution process in person perception. In Advances in experimental social psychology (Vol. 2, pp. 219-266). Academic Press. Background=The na√Øve scientist and attribution theory Before Fiske and Taylor's cognitive miser theory, the predominant model of social cognition was the na√Øve scientist. First proposed in 1958 by Fritz Heider in The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations, this theory holds that humans think and act with dispassionate rationality whilst engaging in detailed and nuanced thought processes for both complex and routine actions. In this way, humans were thought to think like scientists, albeit na√Øve ones, measuring and analyzing the world around them. Applying this framework to human thought processes, na√Øve scientists seek the consistency and stability that comes from a coherent view of the world and need for environmental control. In order to meet these needs, na√Øve scientists make attributions. Thus, attribution theory emerged from the study of the ways in which individuals assess causal relationships and mechanisms. Through the study of causal attributions, led by Harold Kelley and Bernard Weiner amongst others, social psychologists began to observe that subjects regularly demonstrate several attributional biases including but not limited to the fundamental attribution error. The study of attributions had two effects: it created further interest in testing the naive scientist and opened up a new wave of social psychology research that questioned its explanatory power. This second effect helped to lay the foundation for Fiske and Taylor's cognitive miser.  Stereotypes  According to Walter Lippmann's arguments in his classic book Public Opinions,Lippmann, W. (1965). Public Opinion. 1922. URL: http://infomotions. com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext04/pbp nn10. htm. people are not equipped to deal with complexity. Attempting to observe things freshly and in detail is mentally exhausting, especially among busy affairs. The term stereotype is thus introduced: people have to reconstruct the complex situation on a simpler model before they can cope with it, and the simpler model can be regarded as stereotype. Stereotypes are formed from the outside sources which identified with people's own interests and can be reinforced since people could be impressed by those facts that fit their philosophy. On the other hand, in Lippmann's view, people are told about the world before they see it. People's behavior is not based on direct and certain knowledge, but pictures made or given to them. Hence, influence from external factors are unneglectable in shaping people‚Äôs stereotypes. ‚ÄúThe subtlest and most pervasive of all influences are those which create and maintain the repertory of stereotypes.‚Äù That is to say, people live in a second-handed world with mediated reality, where the simplified model for thinking (i.e. stereotypes) could be created and maintained by external forces. Lippmann therefore suggested that the public\\"cannot be wise\\", since they can be easily misled by overly simplified reality which is consistent with their pre-existing pictures in mind, and any disturbance of the existing stereotypes will seem like \\"an attack upon the foundation of the universe\\". Although Lippmann did not directly define the term cognitive miser, stereotypes have important functions in simplifying people's thinking process. As cognitive simplification, it is useful for realistic economic management, otherwise people will be overwhelmed by the complexity of the real rationales. Stereotype, as a phenomenon, has become a standard topic in sociology and social psychology.Jones, E. E., & Colman, A. M. (1996). Stereotypes. In A. Kuper and J. Kuper (Eds), The social science encyclopedia (2nd ed., pp. 843-844). London: Routledge Heuristics Much of the cognitive miser theory is built upon work done on heuristics in judgment and decision-making, most notably Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman results published in a series of influential articles. Heuristics can be defined as the \\"judgmental shortcuts that generally get us where we need to go‚Äîand quickly‚Äîbut at the cost of occasionally sending us off course.\\" In their work, Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated that people rely upon different types of heuristics or mental short cuts in order to save time and mental energy. However, in relying upon heuristics instead of detailed analysis, like the information processing employed by Heider's na√Øve scientist, biased information processing is more likely to occur. Some of these heuristics include: * representativeness heuristic (the inclination to assign specific attributes to an individual the more he/she matches the prototype of that group). * availability heuristic (the inclination to judge the likelihood of something occurring because of the ease of thinking of examples of that event occurring) * anchoring and adjustment heuristic (the inclination to overweight the importance and influence of an initial piece of information, and then adjusting one's answer away from this anchor). The frequency with which Kahneman and Tversky and other attribution researchers found the individuals employed mental shortcuts to make decisions and assessments laid important groundwork for the overarching idea that individuals and their minds act efficiently instead of analytically. The cognitive miser theory The wave of research on attributional biases done by Kahneman, Tversky and others effectively ended the dominance of Heider's na√Øve scientist within social psychology. Fiske and Taylor, building upon the prevalence of heuristics in human cognition, offered their theory of the cognitive miser. It is, in many ways, a unifying theory which suggests that humans engage in economically prudent thought processes, instead of acting like scientists who rationally weigh costs and benefits, test hypothesis, and update expectations based upon the results of the experiments that are our everyday actions. In other words, humans are more inclined to act as cognitive misers using mental short cuts to make assessments and decisions, about issues and ideas about which they know very little as well as issues of great salience. Fiske and Taylor argue that acting as cognitive misers is rational due to the sheer volume and intensity of information and stimuli humans intake Given the limited information processing capabilities of individuals, people are always trying to adopt strategies that simplify complex problems. Cognitive misers usually act in two ways: by ignoring part of the information to reduce their own cognitive load, or by overusing some kind of information to avoid finding more information. However, other psychologists also argue that the cognitively miserly tendency of humans is a primary reason why \\"humans are often less than rational\\". This view holds that evolution makes the brain's allocation and use of cognitive resources extremely embarrassing. The basic principle is to save mental energy as much as possible, even when it is required to \\"use your head\\". Unless the cognitive environment meets certain requirements, we will try to avoid thinking as much as possible. Implications The implications of this theory raise important questions about both cognition and human behavior. In addition to streamlining cognition in complicated, analytical tasks, cognitive misers are also at work when dealing with unfamiliar issues as well as issues of great importance.  Politics  Voting behavior in democracies are an arena in which the cognitive miser is at work. Acting as a cognitive miser should lead those with expertise in an area to more efficient information processing and streamlined decision making. However, as Lau and Redlawsk note, acting as cognitive miser who employs heuristics can have very different results for high-information and low-information voters. They write, \\"...cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters, and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex... heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices.\\" In democracies, where no vote is weighted more or less because of the expertise behind its casting, low-information voters, acting as cognitive misers, can have broad and potentially deleterious choices for a society.  Economics  Cognitive misers could also be one of the contributors to the prisoner's dilemma in gaming theory. To save cognitive energy, cognitive misers tend to assume that other people are similar to themselves. That is, habitual cooperators assume most of the others as cooperators, and habitual defectors assume most of the others as defectors. Since cooperators offer to play more often, and fellow cooperators will also more often accept their offer, the researchers arrived at the consensus that cooperators would have a higher expected payoff compared with defectors when certain boundary conditions are met.  Mass Communication  Lack of public support towards emerging techniques are commonly attributed to lack of relevant information and the low scientific literacy among the public. Known as the knowledge deficit model, this point of view is based on idealistic assumptions that education for science literacy could increase public support of science, and the focus of science communication should be increasing scientific understanding among lay public. However, the relationship between information and attitudes towards scientific issues are not empirically supported.Scheufele DA (2013) Communicating science in social settings. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(Suppl 3):14040‚Äì14047 Based on the assumption that human beings are cognitive misers and tend to minimize the cognitive costs, the concept of low-information rationality is introduced as an empirically grounded alternative in explaining decision making and attitude formation. Instead of in-depth understanding of scientific topics, people make decisions based on other shortcuts or heuristics such as ideological predistortions or cues from mass media, and therefore use only as much information as necessary.Popkin, Samuel (1991). The Reasoning Voter. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press. .Scheufele, D. A., & Turney, J. (2006). Messages and heuristics: How audiences form attitudes about emerging technologies. Engaging science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action. The less expertise citizens have on an issue initially, the more likely they will rely on these shortcuts. The cognitive miser theory thus has an implication for persuading: attitude formation is a competition between people's value systems and prepositions (or their own interpretive schemata) on a certain issue, and how public discourses frame it. Framing theory suggest that the same topic will result in different interpretations among audience, if the information is presented in different ways.Scheufele, D. A., & Tewksbury, D. (2006). Framing, agenda setting, and priming: The evolution of three media effects models. Journal of communication, 57(1), 9-20. Audiences' attitude change is closely connected with relabeling or re-framing the certain issue. In this sense, effective communication can be achieved if media provide audiences with cognitive shortcuts or heuristics that are resonate with underlying audience schemata.  Risk Assessment  The metaphor of cognitive misers could assist people in drawing lessons from risks, which is the possibility that an undesirable state of reality may occur.NRC, U. (1983). Risk assessment in the federal government: managing the process. National Research Council, Washington DC, 11, 3. People apply a number of shortcuts or heuristics in making judgements about the likelihood of an event, because the rapid answers provided by heuristics are often right. Yet certain pitfalls may be neglected in these shortcuts. A practical example of cognitive misers' way of thinking in risk assessment of Deepwater Horizon explosion, is presented below. * People have trouble in imagining how small failings compile up to form a catastrophe; * People tend to get accustomed to risk. Due to the seemingly smooth current situation, people unconsciously adjusted their acceptance of risk; * People tend to over-express their faith and confidence to backup systems and safety devices; * People regard complicated technical systems in line with complicated governing structures; * If concerned with the certain issue, people tend to spread good news and hide bad news; * People tend to think alike if they are in the same field (see also: echo chamber), regardless of whether they are supervising this project or not.  Psychology  The theory that human beings are cognitive misers, also shed light on the dual process theory in psychology. Dual process theory propose that there are two types of cognitive processes in human mind. Daniel Kahneman provided his insight that these two processes could be named as intuitive (or System 1) and reasoning (or System 2) respectively.Kahneman, D (2003). \\"A perspective on judgement and choice\\". American Psychologist. 58 (9): 697‚Äì720. CiteSeerX 10.1.1.186.3636. doi:10.1037/0003-066x.58.9.697. PMID 14584987 When processing with System 1 which start automatically without control, people pay little or even no effort but can generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas. When processing with System 2, people allocate attention to effortful mental activities required, and can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps.Kahneman, D. (2011). Thinking, fast and slow. Macmillan. These two cognitive processing systems are not separate and can have interactions with each other. Here is an example of how people's belief are formed under the dual process model in several steps: # System 1 generates suggestions for System 2, with impressions, intuitions, intentions or feelings; # If System 1's proposal is endorsed by System 2, those impressions and intuitions will turn into beliefs, and the sudden inspiration generated by System 1 will turn into voluntary actions; # When everything goes smoothly (as is often the case), System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. As a result, one will generally believe one's impressions and act on one's desires. However, it does not necessarily mean that cognitive misers process little on System 2. The \\"reasoning\\" process can be activated to help with the intuitions when: # A question arises, but System 1 does not generate an answer; # An event is detected to violate the model of world that System 1 maintains. Conflicts also exists in this dual-process. A brief example provided by Kahneman is that when we try not to stare at the oddly dressed couple at the neighboring table in a restaurant, our automatic reaction (System 1) makes us cannot help staring at them, but conflicts emerge as System 2 of processing tries to control this behavior. The dual processing system can produce cognitive illusions. System 1 always operates automatically, with our easiest shortcut but probably with error. System 2 may also have no clue to the error. Errors can be prevented only by enhanced monitoring of System 2, which costs a plethora of cognitive efforts.  Limitations = Omission of motivation  The cognitive miser's theory, though explained cognitive processes that people tend to go through when making decisions, provide few hints on the role of motivation. In Fiske's subsequent researches, the omission of the role of \\"intent\\" in the metaphor of cognitive miser is recognized. Motivation does affect the activation and use of stereotypes and prejudices.Fiske, S. T. (2004). Intent and Ordinary Bias: Unintended Thought and Social Motivation Create Casual Prejudice. Social Justice Research, 17(2), 117‚Äì127. doi:10.1023/b:sore.0000027405.94966 Updates and later research= Motivated tactician  As mentioned above, people tend to use heuristic shortcuts when making decisions. But the problem remains that although these shortcuts could not compare to effortful thoughts in accuracy, people should have a certain parameter to help them adopt one of the most adequate shortcuts.Kruglanski, A. W. (1994). The social-cognitive bases of scientific knowledge. The social psychology of science, 197-213. Kruglanski proposed that people are combination of na√Øve scientists and cognitive misers: people are flexible social thinkers who choose between multiple cognitive strategies (i.e. speed/ease vs. accuracy/logic) based on their current goals, motives, and needs. Later models suggest that the cognitive miser and the na√Øve scientist create two poles of social cognition that are too monolithic. Instead, Fiske, Taylor, and Arie W. Kruglanski and other social psychologists offer an alternative explanation of social cognition: the motivated tactician. According to this theory, people employ either shortcuts or thoughtful analysis based upon the context and salience of a particular issue. In other words, this theory suggests that humans are, in fact, both naive scientists and cognitive misers. In this sense people are strategic instead of passively choosing the most effortless shortcuts when they allocate their cognitive efforts, and therefore they can decide to be na√Øve scientists or cognitive misers depending on their goals.  Meaning seeker  The meaning seeker theory reject both metaphors of human cognitive behaviors of cognitive miser and motivated tactician. Built within the framework of self-categorization, researchers believe that people employ categorical thinking to make sense of the social world. This kind of categorical thinking give meaning to social stimuli under adverse or difficult processing conditions.Oakes, P. J., & Turner, J. C. (1990). Is limited information processing capacity the cause of social stereotyping?. European review of social psychology, 1(1), 111-135.

Description The building was erected for the opening of the railway although there is now little sign of it on the site; the station building itself was of similar construction to the ones at both Kirk Michael and Sulby Bridge but was demolished some time after the railway closed. The station was opened in 1879 and remained open until the railway closed in 1968. Although the station building has been demolished the large stone-built goods shed remains, as does the goods platform, the former being under the care of the local heritage trust which periodically opens the shed to display a variety of railway items including railwayana and former signage which was once displayed at the station from private collections. A private bungalow now stands on the site of the station building. Location The line itself crossed the main road from the village to Jurby - Station Road - and on the northerly side there was once a modest goods yard, cattle dock and siding. The raised cattle dock is still visible along with a goods shed. Today the disused line is grassed over and is a popular footpath extending as far as Kirk Michael in the west and Lezayre in the east.

Overview  The family is first mentioned in the 13th century with one Prontaguerra (\\"Ready-at-War\\") da Varano, a powerful Guelph leader, who inaugurated the traditional appartenance of the family to that party. His descendant Gentile was also a Guelph leader in Camerino when the town was destroyed by Manfred of Sicily. In the aftermath of the Ghibelline defeat at the Battle of Benevento (1266), Gentile had the town rebuilt and he became its lord. He was made \\"Count of the Roman Campagna\\" by Pope Martin IV (1282), a title which was inherited by his son Rodolfo after Gentile's death two years later. Rodolfo was also capitano del popolo in Lucca. Rodolfo's brother, Berardo, was commander of the papal army for Boniface VIII against the troops sent to Rome by King Philip IV of France. In 1316 Rodolfo died and Berardo became lord of Camerino; three years later he was made \\"Marquis of Ancona\\" by pope John XXI, for which he reconquered the territories of the Papal States in the Marche (Urbino, Fano, Osimo and Recanati). In 1322 he died and was succeeded by his son Gentile, who added Tolentino, Gualdo Tadino and San Ginesio to the family's lands. At Gentile's death in 1355 Camerino and the da Varano territories went to his grandson Rodolfo, who supported cardinal Gil de Albornoz's campaign of reconquest of the Papal States against the local barons. Created gonfaloniere of the Roman Church by Pope Innocent IV, he won several battles against the league of the Ordelaffi and Visconti families. He was later commander of the Florentine army and fought against Bernab√≤ Visconti. Rodolfo died heirless in 1384. His brother Giovanni, also heirless, ruled briefly in Camerino until 1385, being succeeded by the last brother, Gentile III, who continued to traditional pro-Papal policy of the da Varano, obtaining the title of Senator of Rome in 1362. In 1393 his son Rodolfo III, a skilled condottiero, succeeded him, gaining the town of Civitanova and supporting king Ladislaus of Naples during his reign. His death begin the decline of the family, which was weakened by the struggle of power between his members. This ended only in 1444 when Rodolfo IV conquered Camerino; he was however forced to give back Tolentino. His son Giulio Cesare was a capable military leader, but could do little against the assault of Cesare Borgia (the son of Pope Alexander VI) who in 1502 captured and killed him, together with his sons Vincenzo, Annibale and Pirro. The last surviving son, Giovanni Maria, could return in Camerino after the fall of the Borgia. In 1515 he was created Duke of Camerino. He died without heirs in 1529, and the family's lands were annexed to the Duchy of Urbino. {The daughter of the Lord of Camerino Giulia da Varano was married to the Duke of Urbino Guidobaldo II della Rovere}. One Ercole, a son of Rodolfo IV, attempted in vain to reconquer Camerino. His son Mattia was more successful, but was also ousted after a short rule. Piergentile da Varano was the last member of the family to attempt reconquer Camerino in 1549, but again without success. Saint Camilla Battista da Varano Saint Camilla Battista da Varano, O.S.C., (April 9, 1458 ‚Äì May 31, 1524), from Camerino, was an Italian princess and a Poor Clare nun and abbess.

This was later demolished in 1819 and replaced by an even larger building, the first stone of which was laid on 1 April 1819, and the building was completed on 20 April 1820, having cost nearly ¬£6,000. A re-opening service was held on 6 November 1889. The Church was the main Non-Conformist church in the city in the nineteenth century, when it was known as Above Bar Independent Chapel (later on becoming Above Bar Congregational Chapel, the oldest church in the Congregational Union). The pastor from 1810 to 1868 was Rev. Thomas Adkins.A History of Southampton, Vol 3, A.Temple Patterson On 30 November 1940, during the second world war, the church building was destroyed by Luftwaffe bombing. As a result, many of the congregation began attending the nearby St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church. The minister of Above Bar Congregational Church, Rev Maxwell Jones, also moved to St. Andrew's and was formally recognised as the minister of the latter. St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church was founded in 1853, on the corner of Brunswick Place and Dorset Street. By the 1970s, the congregation had dwindled since much of the surrounding housing had been demolished. In the early 1980s, a survey of the building showed that ¬£150,000 was needed to keep them safe. The decision was made to merge with the nearby Avenue Church since both had become United Reformed Churches following the 1972 merger of the Presbyterian Church of England and many churches within the Congregational Union. The St. Andrew's buildings were subsequently demolished and replaced with offices. Avenue Congregational Church Avenue Congregational Church was opened on Wednesday, 7 December 1898.

He was the Archbishop of New Zealand from 2004 to 2006, the first person from the MƒÅori church to hold that office. He was also Bishop of Aotearoa from 1981, the first person to be elected to that position by the congregation rather than being appointed by the church hierarchy. He held both offices until his retirement in 2006. He was also the first person to become a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit after the rank was introduced in 2000. Early life Vercoe was born in T≈çrere, a coastal MƒÅori village (kƒÅinga) near ≈åp≈çtiki in the Eastern Bay of Plenty, in the North Island, to Joseph Vercoe and Wyness Williams. He was named Whakahuihui (\\"to gather together\\") to record the crowds that gathered to pay their respects to his grandmother, who died on the day he was born. His paternal grandfather, Henry Vercoe, was a Cornish farmer and settler in New Zealand. His father left the family soon after he was born, and he was raised by his mother and maternal grandfather, a MƒÅori farmer, in a small earthen-floored shack (kauta). He was educated at T≈çrere Native School, Feilding Agricultural High School, and the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, before studying theology at College House (which was still theologically oriented). Clerical career Vercoe was ordained as a deacon in 1951 and as a priest in the Anglican Church of New Zealand in 1952. He served as a parish priest in, successively, Wellington, Wairarapa, and Rangitikei. He became politically active, and supported the \\"No Maoris No Tour\\" movement in 1960, which complained that no MƒÅori were permitted to join the All Blacks rugby tour to South Africa that year. He joined the New Zealand Army in 1960, and became a military chaplain. He ministered to New Zealand forces in Malaya from 1961 to 1963, and the ANZAC Brigade in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969, and was chaplain at Burnham Military Camp from 1965 to 1971. In the 1970 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He was awarded the MBE in 1970. He was Principal of Te Waipounamu Girls' School from 1971 to 1976, and then Vicar in Ohinemutu from 1976 to 1978. He was promoted to become Archdeacon of TairƒÅwhiti and Vicar-General to Te Pƒ´hopatanga o (the bishopric of) Aotearoa in 1978. Episcopal ministry Vercoe was consecrated as Bishop of Aotearoa (Pƒ´hopa o Aotearoa) at Houmaitawhiti Marae in Rotorua in 1981. He was a leading advocate of MƒÅori rights and supporter of the Treaty of Waitangi. On Waitangi Day in 1990, the 150th anniversary of the Treaty, he complained in a speech attended by Dame Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu, Queen Elizabeth II, the Governor-General Paul Reeves, and Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer, that the promises made in the Treaty had not been honoured by The Crown. Obituary, New Zealand Herald, 15 September 2007 As a result of the continuing tensions between the different peoples of New Zealand, he also opposed immigration to New Zealand. He was in favour of separate public institutions ‚Äì such as schools ‚Äì for MƒÅori people, and in 1980 became the first head of the MƒÅori people in the Anglican Church in New Zealand to be elected, rather than appointed by the church hierarchy. The Anglican Church in New Zealand created three sections in 1992, one for the MƒÅori, another for European New Zealanders (known in MƒÅori as PƒÅkehƒÅ), and a third for Polynesians, recognising the three separate cultural traditions (tikanga) in New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and the Cook Islands. Vercoe became head of the MƒÅori tikanga, Te Pƒ´hopatanga o Aotearoa. Vercoe was appointed a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (the equivalent of a knighthood), for services to MƒÅori and the community, in the 2000 Queen's Birthday Honours, and became Primate and Archbishop of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia (Pihopa Matamua) in 2004. As required by the church constitution at the time, he resigned as Te Pihopa o Aoteatoa in 2004.https://web.archive.org/web/20041024194521/http://www.anglican.org.nz:80/news/NewPihopaRoles.htm He held conservative religious views, condemning homosexuality as \\"unnatural\\" and \\"an abomination\\". A storm of controversy erupted in June 2004 when the New Zealand Herald reported his vision of a \\"world without gays\\". He ordained women as priests, but opposed the ordination of women as bishops and refused to attend the first ordination of a woman as a bishop in New Zealand in 1991, when Penny Jamieson became Bishop of Dunedin. He was diagnosed with cancer of the brain in 2005 and retired due to ill health in 2006. After he stepped down, the office of Archbishop has been shared by the heads of the three tikanga, with William Brown Turei as Primate. Private life and death Vercoe married Doris Eivers in 1951. They had three sons. He died in Lynmore, near Rotorua, his home for over 20 years, on 13 September 2007. He was survived by his wife and their sons. After a farewell ceremony at St Faith's Church in Rotorua on 14 September, his tangi (funeral) at T≈çrere Marae was attended by over 40 Anglican bishops. He was buried at the T≈çrere urupa (burial ground) on 17 September. In August 2009, Vercoe's widow, Doris, was granted the use of the courtesy title of \\"Lady Vercoe\\", following the re- introduction of titular honours by the New Zealand government. She died in February 2016.

It is Tel Aviv's southernmost railway station, located some 400 meters to the east of the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station. It is located between the lanes of the Ayalon Highway, just north of where Highway 1 splits from it. The station building fronts a road bridge above Ayalon Highway, connecting Lewinsky Street with HaHagana Road, hence the station's name. The station serves most Israel Railways lines, and its proximity to the central bus station makes it an important interchange hub. In September 2008 Tel Aviv HaHagana was the third- busiest railway station in Israel with 117,805 boarding and 185,064 alighting passengers, after Tel Aviv Savidor Central and Tel Aviv HaShalom.According to Israel Railways ticket sale statistics Layout history The station was constructed in stages. It was originally built with a single island platform (tracks 1‚Äì2). The station building was constructed above the platform, but only half of its original design was built. Later another island platform (tracks 3‚Äì4) was added to the east of it, and the size of the station building was doubled, making it symmetrical. Finally, another side platform (track 5) was built, which together with platform 4, serve the line to Rishon LeZion Moshe Dayan and Yavne West and Ashdod. These two tracks continue south over a bride crossing above the Tel Aviv‚ÄìLod tracks (which serve passenger platforms 1 through 3). As part of the four-tracking project of the Ayalon Railway, a sixth passenger platform will be built at the station by the late 2020s. The track serving this platform will be connected to a ramp south of the station which will enable a cross-platform interchange at the station. Access Dan Bus Company lines 16, 46, 54, 104, 204 and 304 stop at the station's entrance and on the other side of the HaHagana road bridge. A pedestrian pass under the bridge connects the station with the latter stop. These lines mostly serve southern Tel Aviv, with lines 104 and 204 offering a frequent and fast service to Allenby Street, beach promenades and Ben Yehuda Street. A number of lines stop at HeHarash Street, stretching immediately to the west of the station, parallel to Ayalon Highway. These include Dan line 31, Egged line 26 to Bat Yam, Egged lines 71, 171 and 271 to Holon, Egged line 274 to Rehovot and a few other lines with part-time service run by Egged and Kavim.

Design The Danae class mounted an extra 6 inch gun and a heavier torpedo armament, compared with their predecessors, the . The class also had larger low revolution propellers for greater efficiency. Dauntless herself was completed with a large hangar under her bridge, which was eventually removed in 1920.

HMS Dauntless (D45) at the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda ca 1930 Completed too late to see action in the First World War, in 1919 she was assigned to operate in the Baltic Sea against the Bolshevik revolutionaries in Russia. She was then on detached service in the West Indies. Following this assignment she was attached to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet for the following five years. Dauntless was a member of the Cruise of the Special Service Squadron, also known as the 'Empire Cruise', of 1923/24. Following this tour, she went with the squadron to the Mediterranean for the next few years. In May 1928 Dauntless was recommissioned and assigned to the North America and West Indies Station, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard in Bermuda. She ran aground on 2 July 1928 on the Thrum Cap Shoal, off Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and was badly damaged, suffering the breach of her engine room and of one of her boiler rooms. She was abandoned by most of her 462 crew, the officers remaining on board. Subsequently all of her guns and torpedo tubes and much of her other equipment had to be removed to lighten her. She was finally refloated on 11 July 1928 and towed off by her sister ship and a number of tugs. She was repaired throughout 1929 and was reduced to the reserve. In 1930 she was transferred back to the America and West Indies Station. During 1931-1933 she served with the South American Division, and in 1934 she relieved the cruiser in the Mediterranean and was reassigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron. In 1935 she returned to Britain to be paid off into the reserve. Wartime career On the outbreak of the Second World War, Dauntless was recommissioned and joined the 9th Cruiser Squadron with the South Atlantic Command. In December, the squadron, including Dauntless, was transferred to the China Station, and in March 1940 Dauntless operated as a unit of the British Malaya Force while in the Indian Ocean. She operated mainly off Batavia, keeping watch on German merchant ships in the Dutch East Indies harbours. On 15 June 1941 she collided with the cruiser off Malacca and had to put into Singapore for repairs, that were eventually completed on 15 August. In February 1942 Dauntless returned to Britain, and underwent a refit at Portsmouth. Following this, she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet, and in November was docked in the Selborne dry dock at Simonstown, South Africa, until January 1943. She was then used as a training ship, and in February 1945 was again reduced to the reserve. She was sold to be broken up for scrap on 13 February 1946, and in April that year was broken up at the yards of Thos W Ward, of Inverkeithing.

From 13 November 1750 to 1766 he was the Captain-General of the Netherlands, where he was known as the Duke of Brunswick or (to distinguish him from his eldest brother Charles, who succeeded to their father's title of Duke of Brunswick- L√ºneburg) Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel. Another brother was Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick who led the Allied Anglo-German army during the Seven Years' War. He was probably one of the first victims of the media in Dutch history.Klein, S.R.E. (1995) Patriots Republikanisme. Politieke cultuur in Nederland (1766-1787), p. 12.  Family  He was the third son of Ferdinand Albert II, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, and Antoinette Amalie of Brunswick. He had family ties with various European royal houses. Louis's eldest sister was the wife of Frederick the Great of Prussia; another sister was married to the brother of Frederick the Great and her son would inherit the Prussian crown. A third sister was married to Ernest Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and would have illustrious progeny, including Leopold I of Belgium (grandson). A fourth sister, Juliana Maria married King Frederick V of Denmark in 1752. Louis's brother Anthony Ulrich was married to Anna Leopoldovna, a Russian princess and niece of Empress Anna. Their son Ivan - Louis' nephew - was appointed Emperor of Russia on his birth, but was deposed only months later. Nor was this all. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria was Louis's first cousin (their mothers were sisters). Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange was his niece (her mother was Louis's sister Louise Amalie). In addition, Wilhelmina's daughter Louise, married Charles George August, a grandson of Louis's own brother Charles. Later, in 1764, Louis's nephew Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel (son of his eldest brother) would marry Augusta, eldest sister of George III of Great Britain. Rarely were royal houses so interrelated other as in his case, and this factor was probably the main reason for his supporting the Dutch policy of neutrality during the Seven Years' War.Wijnen, H. van (1987) Vorst Willem, het is alles uw schuld! Oranje en de ondergang van de Republiek bij de omwentelingen 1787-1795, p. 95. In the year 1737, Louis entered the imperial military as Oberst and commander of the Alt-Wolfenb√ºttel infantry regiments. He took part in the Ottoman Wars from September 1739 until the Treaty of Belgrade. He entered the Netherlands in May 1740 as an Austrian major-general.  Duke of Courland  After the arrest of the duke of Courland, Ludwig was elected his successor on 27 June 1741 with the support of his cousin Maria Theresa of Austria. He then went to St Petersburg, and seems to have been interested in marriage with Elizabeth of Russia in the hope to become emperor. However, upon Elizabeth's palace coup on 6 December 1741, his nephew Ivan and all Ivan's German advisers lost their positions, resulting in their exile, imprisonment or departure. Louis Ernest lost his Dukedom of Courland due to the coup and returned to Germany in 1742.  War of the Austrian Succession  He took part in the Second Silesian War from 1744 as an Austrian field-marshal and therefore fought against his brothers and many of his other relatives, who mostly took the side of Prussia. In the battle of Soor on 30 September 1745, he was seriously wounded, but seems to have appeared on the military scene in the Netherlands as early as the spring of 1746. On 11 October 1746, during the War of the Austrian Succession, he took part in the battle of Roucoux against France. In the following year, he fought in the battle of Lauffeldt as Feldzeugmeister or supreme artillery commander, and met stadholder William IV, Prince of Orange, then involved in border battles against France.  Regent of the Netherlands  Dutch caricature of the DukeIn 1749 he entered the Dutch States Army as field marshal by request of William IV, for twenty thousand guilders per annum, although he also retained his position as an Austrian field-marshal and Protestant Generalfeldzeugmeister of the Holy Roman Empire. William's wife Anne was initially sceptical about his appointment and opposed it. In 1751 he became the governor of the garrison city of Bois-le-Duc, where the stadholder had had particular influence since 1629. After the death of William IV on 22 October 1751 and Anne's appointment as regent, Louis Ernest was appointed captain- general (commander-in-chief) of the Netherlands, reorganising the higher strata of the army. Britain and Prussia asked him to command the allied armies in the Seven Years' War, but Louis Ernest refused out of respect for the Dutch Republic's neutrality.Bootsma, N.A. (1962) De hertog van Brunswijk, 1750-1759 - Assen: Van Gorcum, Historische Bibliotheek; 69. His brother Duke Ferdinand was given command of the Anglo-German army in Hanover in 1757. In 1759 Louis was used as an intermediary in an attempt to mediate the conflict, but plans for a peace congress came to nothing. From the death of William V's mother Anne in 1759 to William's majority in 1766, he was William's guardian and led the Netherlands' state affairs in his name. The prince called Louis Ernest his second father, but the Frisian nobility under Onno Zwier van Haren opposed Louis Ernest. Simultaneously, Louis Ernest began reforming the stadholder system that had previously appointed qualified persons to the regions in reward for their loyalty. Such favorites had been supposed to take care of local disputes independently.M.A.M. Franken (2000) Dienaar van Oranje. Andries Schimmelpennick van der Oije 1705-1776. Een politieke en bestuurlijke levensbeschrijving van een Gelders luitenant-stadhouder, p. 186-9, 229. As a result, there was no efficient administrative device in the Republic, nor an equitable apportioning of offices. The prince, losing himself in the details, made it known that he valued advice, which, however, he usually sent back by return of post without any alterations. For over a dozen years he had been drilled by Brunswick and Fagel to believe that his only job was to sign the documents they placed in front of him (and judging from his signature, he was not very good at that).Schama, S. (2005) Patriots and Liberators: Revolution in the Netherlands, 1780-1813, p. 55-9.  William's coming of age  After 1766, the Duke was kept on at the irresolute William's request as his privy councillor and as a Dutch field-marshal, with the object, it is thought by some, to keep William's older sister Carolina in check. The Acte van Consulentschap (Act of Advisorship) had been set up in secret by the Grand Pensionary, Pieter van Bleiswijk, and under this Act Ludwig was to furnish advice by request only. Earlier plans to put in place an advisory council were thus frustrated and in addition, several jealous Dutch noblemen were passed over in favour of the Duke. Louis Ernest was instrumental in arranging the marriage of Prince William V with the Duke's niece, Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia. He immediately observed that the princess craved joint rule, and so was starting to undermine Louis Ernest's dominant position. In long letters she complained about Louis Ernest to her uncle, King Frederick II of Prussia.  Problems and exile  Louis Ernest's accumulated positions and tangled interests led to problems. As early as 1771 there was talk of an attempt on his life in the Hague, but the bullet fired at him passed between his widespread legs. (Rumour had it that an earlier bullet had hit him in his private parts.) Pieter Paulus in 1773 gained national recognition through his book about the stadholderian system, in which he blamed the Duke of Brunswick for the abuses of that system. In December 1780 Great Britain declared war on the Republic. The war went badly for the Dutch and many blamed the Duke. The opposition against the stadtholderian system would rise to a crescendo during the Patriottentijd (named after the political faction that opposed the stadtholder). But even his partisans knew that things had to change for the better. The Amsterdam burgemeester Joachim Rendorp pleaded for an advisory council for the prince. The anti-stadholder party, which gave him the nickname of \\"the Bulky Duke\\" (consistent with Frederick the Great's habit of calling him \\"Fat Louis\\") recognised the decline of the fleet, the growing importance of the Dutch States Army, the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War and the loss of the Barrier Treaty towns in the Austrian Netherlands, and apportioned the blame for all these to Louis Ernest first and foremost. The Patriots argued that Louis Ernest had outrageously neglected the education of the stadholder, so that the stadholder was now unable to take decisions on his own. On 24 May 1782, the duke voluntarily left the Hague and retreated to Government House (the \\"Gouvernementshuis\\") in 's-Hertogenbosch. (It is now the Noordbrabants Museum). The disputes with Austrian Emperor Joseph II (another relative of the Duke), reopened an earlier argument over the Barrier towns, the closure of the Scheldt to shipping on Antwerp, and free trade on the Dutch East Indies. Louis Ernest was mistrusted due to his family ties with the emperor and accused of high treason and of selling out on the fortress city of Maastricht. In Issue no. 214 of the Patriot magazine De Post van den Neder- Rhijn, the Acte of Consulentschap was made public. Because of the ensuing scandal, on 14 October 1784, Louis Ernest resigned all his offices and left 's-Hertogenbosch to its new governor, Robert Douglas. The Kettle War was seen by the Patriots as the emperor's revenge.  Exile  Robert Douglas, painted in 1786 by Jacobus Vrijmoet In 1785, the duke lived in Aachen for a short time. The patriots tried to get hold of his correspondence, using both intrigue and force.Schl√∂zer, A.L. (1786) Lodewijk Ernst, hertog van Brunswyk en Lunenburg ... Echte bescheiden Van het gedrag ten opzigte zijner aanzienlijke waardigheden, als Veldmaarschalk, Voogd en Reprezentant van ... den Heere Erfstadhouder P.W. de V. van Oranje; in de Vereenigde Nederlanden. Throughout Europe, the nobility came under heavy criticism, and some of the Patriots (anticipating the fate of the nobility and its privileges) followed suit, making public all records relating to the duke so as to broadcast news of his fall right across the continent. The patriots were also energetic that year in organizing provincial armies and exercising free corps and exercitiegenootschappen (military societies) with democratically chosen officers, leading to the first democratically elected city government in the city Utrecht, but also to the occupation of Elburg and Hattem by the Stadtholderian troops in September 1786. Louis Ernest stayed in Eisenach from 1786, where, with the help of August Ludwig von Schl√∂zer, he wrote his Autobiography and its sequel, his Defence. Both works were soon translated from their original German into Dutch. He was in close contact with the court at Weimar, especially with his niece, Duchess Anna Amalia, and with Duke Charles August. Louis Ernest's nephew, the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, occupied the Dutch Republic on 13 September 1787, forcing many Patriots to flee the country. Louis Ernest died in Eisenach in 1788 and was buried in the Welf family vault in Brunswick Cathedral. His diaries, written by his secretary, the 180 pamphlets and publications in the Nieders√§chsisches Staatsarchiv in Wolfenb√ºttel, are studied.

Some economists, including Barry Eichengreen, Hyman Minsky, and other Post-Keynesian economists, and some members of the Austrian school, regard credit cycles as the fundamental process driving the business cycle. However, mainstream economists believe that the credit cycle cannot fully explain the phenomenon of business cycles, with long term changes in national savings rates, and fiscal and monetary policy, and related multipliers also being important factors. Investor Ray Dalio has counted the credit cycle, together with the debt cycle, the wealth gap cycle and the global geopolitical cycle, among the main forces that drive worldwide shifts in wealth and power.Dalio, Ray. \\"The Big Cycles in a Tiny Nutshell\\", LinkedIn, 2 April 2020 During an expansion of credit, asset prices are bid up by those with access to leveraged capital. This asset price inflation can then cause an unsustainable speculative price \\"bubble\\" to develop. The upswing in new money creation also increases the money supply for real goods and services, thereby stimulating economic activity and fostering growth in national income and employment. When buyers' funds are exhausted, an asset price decline can occur in the markets which had benefited from the credit expansion. This can then cause insolvency, bankruptcy, and foreclosure for those borrowers who came late to that market. This, in turn, can threaten the solvency and profitability of the banking system itself, resulting in a general contraction of credit as lenders attempt to protect themselves from losses.

The album was originally intended to be a live recording of a November 1958 performance at Philadelphia's Latin Casino, but the mono recording of the concert was disregarded by producer Al Ham who wanted the album recorded in stereo. Bennett and Basie were then reunited in the studio a month later to recreate the live concert. Fake applause was dubbed onto the original release of In Person! by Ham, and placed in incorrect places on the album. The effect was poorly received and removed for the album's 1994 re- issue. In his autobiography, The Good Life, Bennett wrote that \\"I never understood why we didn't release the live version.

Unlike in England and Wales, where a pyramid system of 4 regions and a Premier above exists, the Scottish system is separate. However, Scottish universities do receive places in the end of season knock-out tournaments which decide overall British champions (see individual division entries below). However, due to the small size of the divisions (with clubs playing either 6 or 8 fixtures per season), some Scottish universities organise teams to play in regional or national leagues as part of the general Scottish league system for clubs, the Scottish League Championship. In addition, some universities organise University Saturday Leagues for their 2nd XV (see below), or they organise informal friendly matches. The following universities have teams playing elsewhere in Scottish Rugby: * Edinburgh University RFC play in Division One of the Scottish National Leagues. * Royal Dick Veterinary College RFC, which is part of the University of Edinburgh, play in Division Two of the Scottish National League, East. They do not participate in BUSA or USL leagues. * Aberdeen University RFC, St Andrews University RFC and Stirling University RFC play in Division One of the Scottish National League, Caledonia. * Edinburgh University RFC, 2nd XV play in the 2nd Division(East) of The Scottish 2nd XV League. * Edinburgh University RFC, 3rd XV play in the 3rd Division (East)of The Scottish 2nd XV League. * Edinburgh University RFC, 4th XV(Freshers) play in SRU development leagues * Edinburgh University WRFC play in the Premier Division of the SWRU League. They participate in the BUSA Premier North league, whilst their 2nd XV plays in the SUSA League. * Dundee University WRFC, Glasgow University WRFC and The Saints WRFC (St Andrews University) play in the First Division of the SWRU League. Scotland is allocated the current proportion of places in the BUSA end of season knock-out tournaments: * 2 of the 16 places in the BUCS Championship * 2 of the 16 places in the BUCS Trophy * 2 of the 16 places in the BUCS Shield * 2 of the 32 places in the BUCS Plate * 8 of the 32 places in the BUCS Vase * 2 of the 16 places in the BUCS Women's Championship A Scottish Universities Cup is also held, usually towards the end of the season. BUSA Scottish Conference, 2010-2011 Promotion and relegation has usually been one up, one down, but with play-offs for teams at the top of the groups in Division 3 and Division 4.

There are several types of subject-verb inversion in English: locative inversion, directive inversion, copular inversion, and quotative inversion. The most frequent type of inversion in English is subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion in which an auxiliary verb changes places with its subject; it often occurs in questions, such as Are you coming?, with the subject you is switched with the auxiliary are. In many other languages, especially those with a freer word order than English, inversion can take place with a variety of verbs (not just auxiliaries) and with other syntactic categories as well. When a layered constituency-based analysis of sentence structure is used, inversion often results in the discontinuity of a constituent, but that would not be the case with a flatter dependency-based analysis. In that regard, inversion has consequences similar to those of shifting. In English In broad terms, one can distinguish between two major types of inversion in English that involve verbs: subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion and subject‚Äìverb inversion.The use of terminology here, subject-auxiliary inversion and subject‚Äìverb inversion, follows Greenbaum and Quirk (1990:410). The difference between these two types resides with the nature of the verb involved: whether it is an auxiliary verb or a full verb. Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion The most frequently occurring type of inversion in English is subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion. The subject and auxiliary verb invert (switch positions): ::a. Fred will stay. ::b. Will Fred stay? \\\\- Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion with yes/no question ::a. Larry has done it. ::b. What has Larry done? \\\\- Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion with constituent question ::a. Fred has helped at no point. ::b. At no point has Fred helped. \\\\- Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion with fronted expression containing negation (negative inversion) ::a. If we were to surrender, ... ::b. Were we to surrender, ... \\\\- Subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion in condition clause ‚Äì see The default order in English is subject‚Äìverb (SV), but a number of meaning-related differences (such as those illustrated above) motivate the subject and auxiliary verb to invert so that the finite verb precedes the subject; one ends up with auxiliary‚Äìsubject (Aux-S) order. That type of inversion fails if the finite verb is not an auxiliary: ::a. Fred stayed. ::b. *Stayed Fred? \\\\- Inversion impossible here because the verb is NOT an auxiliary verb (The star * is the symbol used in linguistics to indicate that the example is grammatically unacceptable.) Subject‚Äìverb inversion In languages like Italian, Spanish, Finnish, etc. subject-verb inversion is commonly seen with a wide range of verbs and does not require an element at the beginning of the sentence. See the following Italian example: : In English, on the other hand, subject-verb inversion generally takes the form of a Locative inversion. A familiar example of subject-verb inversion from English is the presentational there construction. : English (especially written English) also has an inversion construction involving a locative expression other than there (\\"in a little white house\\" in the following example): : Contrary to the subject-auxiliary inversion, the verb in cases of subject‚Äìverb inversion in English is not required to be an auxiliary verb; it is, rather, a full verb or a form of the copula be. If the sentence has an auxiliary verb, the subject is placed after the auxiliary and the main verb. For example: ::a. A unicorn will come into the room. ::b. Into the room will come a unicorn. Since this type of inversion generally places the focus on the subject, the subject is likely to be a full noun or noun phrase rather than a pronoun. Third-person personal pronouns are especially unlikely to be found as the subject in this construction: ::a. Down the stairs came the dog. \\\\- Noun subject ::b. ? Down the stairs came it. \\\\- Third-person personal pronoun as subject; unlikely unless it has special significance and is stressed ::c. Down the stairs came I. \\\\- First-person personal pronoun as subject; more likely, though still I would require stress In other languages Certain other languages, like other Germanic languages and Romance languages, use inversion in ways broadly similar to English, such as in question formation. The restriction of inversion to auxiliary verbs does not generally apply in those languages; subjects can be inverted with any type of verb, but particular languages have their own rules and restrictions. For example, in French, tu aimes le chocolat is a declarative sentence meaning \\"you like the chocolate\\". When the order of the subject tu (\\"you\\") and the verb aimes (\\"like\\") is switched, a question is produced: aimes-tu le chocolat? (\\"do you like the chocolate?\\"). In German, similarly, du magst means \\"you like\\", whereas magst du can mean \\"do you like?\\". In languages with V2 word order, such as German, inversion can occur as a consequence of the requirement that the verb appear as the second constituent in a declarative sentence. Thus, if another element (such as an adverbial phrase or clause) introduces the sentence, the verb must come next and be followed by the subject: Ein Jahr nach dem Autounfall sieht er wirklich gut aus, literally \\"A year after the car accident, looks he really good\\". The same occurs in some other West Germanic languages, like Dutch, in which this is Een jaar na het auto-ongeval ziet hij er werkelijk goed uit. (In such languages, inversion can function as a test for syntactic constituency since only one constituent may surface preverbally.) In languages with free word order, inversion of subject and verb or of other elements of a clause can occur more freely, often for pragmatic reasons rather than as part of a specific grammatical construction.  Locative inversion  Locative inversion is a common linguistic phenomenon that has been studied by linguists of various theoretical backgrounds. In multiple Bantu languages, such as Chichewa , the locative and subject arguments of certain verbs can be inverted without changing the semantic roles of those arguments, similar to the English subject-verb inversion examples above. Below are examples from Zulu, where the numbers indicate Noun classes, SBJ = subject agreement prefix, APPL = applicative suffix, FV = final vowel in Bantu verbal morphology, and LOC is the locative circumfix for adjuncts. * Canonical word order: *# A-bantwana ba- fund-el-a e-sikole-ni. *# 2-2.child 2.SBJ-study-APPL-FV LOC:7-7.school-LOC *# \\"The children study at the school.\\" * Locative inversion: *# I-sikole si-fund- el-a a-bantwana. *# 7-7.school 7.SBJ-study-APPL-FV 2-2.child *# ‚âà \\"The children study at the school.\\" (Literally \\"The school studies the children.\\") In the locative inversion example, isikole, \\"school\\" acts as the subject of the sentence while semantically remaining a locative argument rather than a subject/agent one. Moreover, we can see that it is able to trigger subject- verb agreement as well, further indicating that it is the syntactic subject of the sentence. This is in contrast to examples of locative inversion in English, where the semantic subject of the sentence controls subject-verb agreement, implying that it is a dislocated syntactic subject as well: # Down the hill rolls the car. # Down the hill roll the cars. In the English examples, the verb roll agrees in number with cars, implying that the latter is still the syntactic subject of the sentence, despite being in a noncanonical subject position. However, in the Zulu example of locative inversion, it is the noun isikole, \\"school\\" that controls subject-verb agreement, despite not being the semantic subject of the sentence. Locative inversion is observed in Mandarin Chinese. Consider the following sentences: * Canonical word order : * Locative inversion : In canonical word order, the subject (g«éngsh√†o 'sentry') appears before the verb and the locative expression (m√©nk«íu 'door') after the verb. In Locative inversion, the two expressions switch the order of appearance: it is the locative that appears before the verb while the subject occurs in postverbal position. In Chinese, as in many other languages, the inverted word order carry a presentational function, that is, it is used to introduce new entities into discourse Lena, L. 2020. Chinese presentational sentences: the information structure of Path verbs in spoken discourse\\". In: Explorations of Chinese Theoretical and Applied Linguistics. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.. Theoretical analyses Syntactic inversion has played an important role in the history of linguistic theory because of the way it interacts with question formation and topic and focus constructions. The particular analysis of inversion can vary greatly depending on the theory of syntax that one pursues. One prominent type of analysis is in terms of movement in transformational phrase structure grammars.The movement analysis of subject-auxiliary inversion is pursued, for instance, by Ouhalla (1994:62ff.), Culicover (1997:337f.), Radford (1988: 411ff., 2004: 123ff). Since those grammars tend to assume layered structures that acknowledge a finite verb phrase (VP) constituent, they need movement to overcome what would otherwise be a discontinuity. In dependency grammars, by contrast, sentence structure is less layered (in part because a finite VP constituent is absent), which means that simple cases of inversion do not involve a discontinuity;Concerning the dependency grammar analysis of inversion, see Gro√ü and Osborne (2009: 64-66). the dependent simply appears on the other side of its head. The two competing analyses are illustrated with the following trees: ::Trees illustrating inversion The two trees on the left illustrate the movement analysis of subject-auxiliary inversion in a constituency-based theory; a BPS-style (bare phrase structure) representational format is employed, where the words themselves are used as labels for the nodes in the tree. The finite verb will is seen moving out of its base position into a derived position at the front of the clause. The trees on the right show the contrasting dependency-based analysis. The flatter structure, which lacks a finite VP constituent, does not require an analysis in terms of movement but the dependent Fred simply appears on the other side of its head Will. Pragmatic analyses of inversion generally emphasize the information status of the two noncanonically-positioned phrases ‚Äì that is, the degree to which the switched phrases constitute given or familiar information vs. new or informative information. Birner (1996), for example, draws on a corpus study of naturally-occurring inversions to show that the initial preposed constituent must be at least as familiar within the discourse (in the sense of Prince 1992) as the final postposed constituent ‚Äì which in turn suggests that inversion serves to help the speaker maintain a given-before-new ordering of information within the sentence. In later work, Birner (2018) argues that passivization and inversion are variants, or alloforms, of a single argument-reversing construction that, in turn, serves in a given instance as either a variant of a more general preposing construction or a more general postposing construction. The overriding function of inverted sentences (including locative inversion) is presentational: the construction is typically used either to introduce a discourse-new referent or to introduce an event which in turn involves a referent which is discourse-new. The entity thus introduced will serve as the topic of the subsequent discourseLambrecht, K., 2000. When subjects behave like objects: An analysis of the merging of S and O in sentence-focus constructions across languages. Studies in Language, 24(3), pp.611-682.. Consider the following spoken Chinese example: : : The constituent y√≠ l«éot√≥ur \\"an old man\\" is introduced for the first time into discourse in post-verbal position. Once it is introduced by the presentational inverted structure, it can be coded by the proximal demonstrative pronoun zh√® ‚Äòthis‚Äô and then by the personal pronoun tƒÅ ‚Äì denoting an accessible referent: a referent that is already present in speakers‚Äô consciousness.

It was founded by a Mr. Mzobe in the late 1970s. The land on which the settlement was founded is steep and runs down between the Municipal Dump and the 6 lane Umgeni Road. At the time of the occupation, the suburb of Clare Estate was reserved, under apartheid legislation, for the exclusive use of people of Indian descent. The initial occupation was covert with shacks hidden in the bush and people being careful not to be seen entering or exiting the bush on the land. But the early 1980s, the settlement had attained critical mass and the occupation became overt. Various attempts to force people off the land were resisted and by the late 1980s the City accepted the permanency of the settlement.Maharaj, B. 2002, 'Segregation, Desegregation and De-racialisation: Racial Politics and the City of Durban', in B. Freund & V. Padayachee (eds), (D)Urban vortex: A South African City in Transition, University of Natal Press, Pietermaritzburg. A development NGO linked to big capital, the Urban Foundation, began the upgrade and installed electricity and toilets and built a hall. However, in 1995, a year after the end of apartheid, the decision to allow the settlement to become permanent was withdrawn. Since then, there has been constant pressure for people to accept relocation to the rural periphery of the city. Thus far, this pressure has been successfully resisted. 2005 Road blockade On 19 March 2005, around 800 people from Kennedy Road blocked Umgeni Road and held it against the police for four hours, resulting in 14 arrests.Struggle Is a School: The Rise of a Shack Dwellers‚Äô Movement in Durban, South Africa, Richard Pitthouse, Monthly Review, 2006 In October that year, the Kennedy Road Development Committee, together with Committees from 11 other settlements, announced the formation of a city wide movement of shack dwellers known as Abahlali baseMjondolo.Pithouse, R. 2007, 'The University of Abahlali baseMjondolo', www.abahlali.org, 24 October. Retrieved on 24 August 2008. By the end of 2007 the movement had members in 40 settlements in the cities of Durban, Pinetown, and Pietermaritzburg and smaller towns like Port Shepstone and Tongaat. 14 of these settlements are affiliated to the movement and are known as the autonomous settlements. In the other settlements the movement has branches with a minimum size of 50. Violence at the Kennedy Road settlement from September 2009 On 26 September 2009, it was reported that a group of about 40 people wielding guns and knives attacked an Abahlali baseMjondolo youth meeting. The attackers allegedly demolished residents' homes and 2 people were killed in the resulting violence. The attacks continued through Tuesday 28 September 2009. It was reported by independent local and international academics as well as members of the Abahlali baseMjondolo movement that the attackers were affiliated with the local branch of the African National Congress and that the attack was carefully planned and sanctioned by the local police. However this has been denied by the ANC and the police who blame a 'forum' associated with Abahlali baseMjondolo for the violence.Ethnic Tensions Boil Over, Niren Tolsi, Mail & Guardian, 3 October 2009 The attacks have garnered national and international condemnation with some people labelling the events a 'coup'. Churches also issued statements of condemnation.South African Council of Churches Appalled by Violent Attacks Against Democracy The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Safety and Security held meetings for stakeholders however these were condemned as unrepresentative by church leaders and AbM representatives. AbM said that they are victims of a 'purge' and that they refused to sit side by side with attackers and have called for an independent investigation into the attacks.Kennedy olive branch a sham Mail & Guardian A number of well known intellectuals, including Noam Chomsky, have expressed concern about the attacksStatement in support of Abahlali baseMjondolo, by Noam Chomsky et al,9 October 2009 and Human Rights Watch, Wilson Johwa, 'Slum dwellers‚Äô body wants Langa to lead attack probe', Business Day, 5 November 2009 the Centre for the Study of Democracy, Call for President to Establish a Commission of Inquiry into Violence Against Shackdwellers The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights Letter to President Jacob Zuma from the Norwegian Centre for Human Rights and Amnesty International Failure to conduct impartial investigation into Kennedy Road violence is leading to further human rights abuses, Amnesty International, 16 December 2009 supported the call for an independent commission of inquiry into the attacks.

There have been two \\"Youth League factions\\" in recent memory, without direct political lineage between each other. The first, in the 1980s, comprised cadres of Youth League background who supported party general secretary Hu Yaobang: the term \\"Tuanpai\\" was originally used to criticise Hu Yaobang for over-reliance of cadres of Youth League background. The second, from the 2000s, comprised party general secretary Hu Jintao and his group of populist associates and other political allies. Characteristics=First Youth League faction Members of the original Youth League faction were reformist members of the Communist Party leadership who had risen into positions of power with the rise of Hu Yaobang at the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s. Like Hu, many of them had been part of the Communist Youth League leadership in the 1950s and 1960s, and had in their youths either participated directly in the Communist Party's armed forces, or in the anti-Kuomintang student movement, during the Chinese Civil War. In contrast to the more conservative \\"elders\\" who still had influence behind the scenes, the Youth League faction were younger, more liberal in political outlook, and enthusiastic in devising and implementing political and economic reform. Many of them played key roles in Hu Yaobang's programme of reform in the 1980s. The Youth League faction was greatly weakened when Hu Yaobang was sidelined in an internal power struggle instigated by the conservative faction. Some members continued to serve under Zhao Ziyang, Hu's replacement as party leader and also a reformist, while others were moved into less important positions. When Zhao was also deposed in 1989, many remaining members of the Youth League faction were purged from the Party leadership, and the faction ceased to exist as such. Second Youth League faction Hu Jintao became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2002. Hu Jintao also has a background in the Communist Youth League (though he is of a younger generation than Hu Yaobang's Youth League colleagues). Hu's rise to power roused interest in members of the party leadership who, like him, had a background in the Youth League. Hu Jintao is himself sometimes counted as a member of the first Youth League faction, as he was promoted to head the Youth League under Hu Yaobang's leadership. However, the younger Hu's subsequent rise to power owed more to the patronage of Deng Xiaoping and other party elders than that of the elder Hu. As a result, there is no direct political lineage between the two Youth League factions. Political analyst Cheng Li of Brookings Institution divides the contemporary Communist Party power structure into two distinct \\"coalitions\\" - one of \\"Populists\\" and the other of \\"Elitists\\". Elitists are classified as those who originate mostly in China's rich coastal provinces, notably Shanghai, or those who have a family background of high-ranking Communist Party officials (i.e. the Princelings). The Youth League faction, on the other hand, belongs to the \\"Populist\\" faction, consisting of officials who have relatively humble backgrounds and who have climbed through the power structure from the grassroots. While the Elitists were more concerned with economic growth and market functionality, the Populists were more focused on societal harmony and decreasing inequality, Li explains. He places the Youth League faction at the core of the Populist coalition. The Youth League faction's members usually have higher education qualifications, normally they all have university degrees or higher.

The engagement was part of Prince Eugene of Savoy's campaign to seize the Spanish controlled Duchy of Milan in the Italian peninsula, and had followed his victory over Marshal Catinat at the Battle of Carpi in July. Marshal Villeroi replaced Catinat as commander of the Franco‚ÄìSpanish‚ÄìSavoyard forces in the theatre, carrying with him orders from King Louis XIV to push the Imperialists out of Italy. Foreseeing Villeroi's intention of attacking at any price, Eugene entrenched himself in front of the small fortress of Chiari, and waited for the attack. In a battle that lasted several hours the Austrians inflicted heavy casualties on Villeroi's forces, gaining an overwhelming victory. The victory in the campaign established Eugene in Lombardy, and helped to persuade the Maritime Powers to come to the aid of the Emperor. Within a week of the battle England, the Dutch Republic, and Leopold I had signed the second treaty of the Grand Alliance. Prelude After his defeat at the Battle of Carpi on 9 July 1701 the French commander, Nicolas Catinat, precipitously retired behind the river Mincio, leaving Prince Eugene in command of the whole country between that river and the Adige. Eugene now effected the passage of the Mincio at Peschiera del Garda, driving the French farther back across the Oglio.Coxe: History of the House of Austria, II, 482‚Äì83 (See map). The failure of Catinat to withstand the advance of a much smaller Imperial army evoked indignation at Versailles, leading King Louis XIV to replace Catinat with the ageing duc de Villeroi. Villeroi ‚Äì with orders to risk a battle ‚Äì arrived in theatre in late August.McKay: Prince Eugene of Savoy, 60 Louis XIV needed a victory to assure the continued loyalty of Italy to his grandson's regime. On 7 September, not knowing the battle had already been fought, the French King wrote to his commander, \\"I cannot tell you how pleased I am to have you in command ‚Ä¶ I have reason to believe that you will finish the campaign gloriously\\".Wolf: Louis XIV, 628 Villeroi joined the army, and his generals ‚Äì the Duke of Savoy, Catinat, and the Prince of Vaud√©mont ‚Äì and marched to find the enemy, confident he would drive them from Italy. Battle Eugene welcomed the prospect of a decisive battle, and waited on the eastern side of the Oglio to be attacked. The Imperial commander had chosen his ground carefully, entrenching his troops and guns in front of the small fortress of Chiari. Streams protected his position on three sides: as there was not enough room for a cavalry engagement, Eugene could count on a frontal attack by the French infantry. The north Italian campaign, 1701. Villeroi ignored Catinat's warning that Eugene was in a strong position, remarking that the King, \\"had not sent so many brave men just to look at the enemy through their spy glasses.\\" On 1 September the Franco-Spanish infantry advanced. Deceived by the report of spies that the Imperialists were retiring, Villeroi crossed the Oglio and pushed on to Chiari expecting to attack their rear guard;Coxe: History of the House of Austria, II, 483 but instead, the French commander encountered the whole Imperial army securely entrenched in their positions. Firing from point-blank range the Austrians drove back the French with a withering fire, imposing a heavy toll in a contest as destructive as any battle during the war in Italy. With only minor losses the Imperial army had inflicted over 3,000 casualties in the ranks, and over 250 officers. This number would grow rapidly as fever attacked the wounded.Wolf: Louis XIV, 629 Villeroi lost personal control during the battle, and Catinat, despite being wounded, had to organise a retreat. The French dug themselves in only a mile or so away from the Austrians on the same side of the Oglio. Here, the two opposing sides remained for the next two months: the French were too much discouraged by their repulse to resume the assault, and Eugene was unwilling to risk the advantages he had gained by attacking the French in their strong defensive position. However, as autumn advanced, conditions deteriorated in both camps: fodder was so short that Eugene's horses were forced to eat fallen leaves. But the French, whose camp was built on marshy ground, suffered most, and they moved out first in mid-November, crossing the Oglio before entering winter quarters in the Duchy of Milan.McKay: Prince Eugene of Savoy, 61 Initial disposition of both forces. Aftermath In Milan, the French presence proved increasingly unpopular: five million livres for soldiers' pay and lodgings, and two million for fodder, had soon been imposed on the local population, most of which had to be taken by force. For his winter quarters Eugene proceeded to reduce the whole Duchy of Mantua, except the capital and Goito, which he closely blockaded; shortly after he occupied Mirandola and Guastalla. Eugene's relationship with the local population had been good and he had kept a tight control: he had executed 48 of his men for looting, telling the Emperor that he had 'imposed more severe discipline than has possibly ever been seen in an army'. Eugene had received little cash from the Emperor, far less than he expected, but he had secured a sound footing in northern Italy and, as hoped, his success helped to encourage the Maritime Powers to come to the aid of Leopold I. Since the beginning of the year Count Wratislaw had been in London as Imperial minister, pressing for assistance. With Eugene's two victories (Carpi and Chiari), Leopold I had proved he would fight to protect his interests, giving Wratislaw the arguments he needed to push through the alliance with the Maritime Powers.Spielman: Leopold I of Austria, 184‚Äì85 On 7 September 1701 ‚Äì within a week of the battle ‚Äì England and the Dutch Republic signed the second treaty of the Grand Alliance, backing the Emperor's claims to the Spanish possessions in Italy. The French were still in Milan, but their position was weak: morale was poor and desertion was high. Louis XIV wrote to Villeroi urging him to work closely with Catinat and, \\"not again to attack the enemy without advantage.\\" \\"If you do ‚Ä¶ the King, my grandson, will lose Italy.\\"Wolf: Louis XIV, 630 By October French optimism for the campaign was gone, but Louis XIV hoped to send reinforcements for next year's campaign, believing the Emperor would not be able to make a comparable increase in Eugene's strength. However, the campaign season was not yet over. As Villeroi settled down for the winter, Eugene was preparing to attack him at his headquarters in Cremona. NotesReferences *Chandler, David G (1990).

His elder cousin, Herbert Royle, who was already a highly successful landscape painter, encouraged the young Stanley to pursue his interest in art as a career and in 1904 Stanley began studying at the Sheffield Technical School of Art. In 1908, he gained a scholarship, which enabled him to continue his studies at the art school. His earliest inspiration was his tutor, Oliver Senior, Painting Master at the art school, of whom he had a very high opinion, and who exhibited at the Royal Academy. His first employment was as an illustrator and designer for local newspapers. In 1911 he began exhibiting professionally in the UK and in 1912 the family moved to a house in Shiregreen, another rural suburb of Sheffield. His first major success was to have three paintings accepted by the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1913. The Royal Academy As a young man he was a keen ice skater; on one visit to the ice rink he met Lily Goulding and subsequently, in 1914 they married, living initially with his parents in Shiregreen. In 1913 he had painted Spring Morning Amongst the Bluebells which depicts his young wife-to-be standing amongst the bluebells and birch trees of Woolley Woods in Sheffield which were local to his home. He painted other versions of this subject, in which there is no figure, but this one, which was accepted by the Royal Academy in 1914 was and remains the main example of this genre. Their daughter, Jean Royle, was born on 19 January 1915 at Ridgeway, near Sheffield. She inherited this painting and it remained in her possession until 1992 when she sold it at auction. Stanley Royle suffered from Bright's disease and this prevented him from joining the forces in the First World War. In the same year that his daughter was born, his oil painting \\"Ploughing (A Fresh Morning: View of Mosborough from Renishaw)\\" was accepted by the Royal Academy. In 1916, the family moved to Priest Hill Farm on Quiet Lane in the Mayfield Valley, outside Sheffield on the edge of the Derbyshire moors. Stanley Royle was successful in having two major works accepted by the Royal Academy that year. His election to associate member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1918 indicated his increasing importance as a landscape painter. By 1920, he had been elected a full member of the RSBA (Royal Society of British Artists) and was teaching part-time at the Sheffield School of Art. The family spent their summer holiday at Ravenglass in Cumbria which Jean, then five years old, always remembered with great delight. In 1921, after having been married for 7 years, he was inspired to paint Morning on the Derbyshire Moors. In this oil painting he captures the remoteness of the moorland landscape by using the figure of his wife in the foreground to contrast against the wild and open spaces of the moors. His technique is impressionistic with almost a pointillist effect combined with broad sweeps of colour. The dress and bonnet Lily is wearing were made for her by her sister Frances who was an excellent seamstress. Mike Tooby, Professor of Art and Design at Bath School of Art and Design writes eloquently and with insight about this painting . His article is available to read on the official Stanley Royle website:http://www.stanleyroyle.com/morning-on-the-derbyshire-moors-an- appraisal-by-mike-tooby/ Although Stanley Royle often used female figures within his compositions these were usually secondary to the landscape, which formed his chief interest. However, the three paintings Spring Morning Amongst the Bluebells, 'The Lilac Sun Bonnet' and The Goose Girl' all show single female figures prominently displayed in the foreground, whilst in later works figures give way in importance to the landscape. The four major views of Sheffield In 1922, he received a prestigious commission from Frederick Horner, a local art dealer, to paint four large views in oils of Sheffield: Sheffield from Mayfields; Sheffield from Wincobank Wood; Sheffield from the Park; Sheffield from Crookes. This quartet of paintings forms a significant part of the collection of Stanley Royle's work in Museums Sheffield. In 2005 one of this group, Sheffield from Wincobank Wood was included in the Tate Britain's exhibition 'A Picture of Britain'. Living in an outlying rural district with limited public transport did not prevent Stanley Royle from undertaking large, ambitious canvasses of significant landscapes, as shown by his study 'Burbage Valley' Museums Sheffield. Sometimes he would walk, but often cycle, to his chosen viewpoint, with all his painting equipment and canvas strapped to the side of his bike! Whilst painting 'Burbage Valley' he hid the canvas in a cave in order not to damage the wet paint by transporting it home. The subject of the much acclaimed oil painting 'The Goose Girl' now in the National Gallery of Ireland was his wife Lily. Her health was sometimes poor which prevented her from posing. On these occasions her younger sister Frances took her place, which is why this figure differs subtly from that of the figure in 'Spring Morning amongst the Bluebells'. The setting is almost certainly Whitely Woods as by then the family lived close by. It was painted in the early 1920s and was exhibited in both Glasgow and Liverpool in 1924. This work had been attributed to the artist William Leech, until Jean Royle sold her aforementioned painting 'Spring Morning Amongst the Bluebells' in 1992. Not until then was it recognised that the same artist must have produced both paintings. In 1925, after resigning from the RSBA, Stanley Royle was elected an associate member of The Royal West of England Academy. His success as a painter made it possible for the family to move to a newly built house at Park Head Crescent in Ecclesall and by 1930 he co-founded of the Sheffield Print Club. \\"The Depression\\" and Canada 1930 and 1931 were particularly hard financially, and in order to survive Royle took a post as illustrator with the \\"Sheffield Independent\\" Newspaper. For several years he had privately taught a pupil who was the Principal of the Nova Scotia College of Art, Canada. She visited Britain each summer, and eventually persuaded Royle to emigrate in December 1931, with his wife and daughter, to take up a post as a lecturer in painting there (the \\"Great Depression\\" had made it impossible for him to make a living in the England). His daughter, then almost 17 years old, had already begun studying fine art at Sheffield Art College, and was in her second year there, when her studies were disrupted by the emigration. Initially Stanley Royle taught at the Nova Scotia School of Art. However, although he was much admired by both his contemporaries and his students, his relationship with the Principal was never easy and in 1934 he was dismissed. The family returned to Britain and Sheffield in the summer of that year, but in 1935 he was offered a professorial post at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, and so returned to continue teaching in Canada. The Art Gallery of Nova Scotia now have one of the largest public collections of Stanley Royle's work. In 1936 he was made an Associate Member of the Royal Canadian Academy. During his time in Canada he produced dynamic studies in oils of the Rocky Mountains and dramatic seascapes and coastal scenes which, with his snow and moorland scenes in Britain, form some of his finest works. Throughout his years in Canada he returned frequently to Europe during the long summer vacations, where he conducted painting tutorials on the Isle of Sark, and in Dorset and Derbyshire. The Royal Canadian Academy of Fine Arts Snow scenes were amongst Royle's favourite subjects because of the light reflected off the snow and the subtleties of colour thus created. He considered the winter landscape to have more colour than at other times of the year. His daughter described how he would wear knee-breeches, and knee length lace-up boots, which were warmer than Wellingtons, to paint 'plein-air' snow scenes. Stanley Royle became a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1942 and in 1945 he and his wife returned to the UK where he sojourned with his daughter and family in Suffolk before settling in north Nottinghamshire. Many of his paintings emphasise the sky by making use of a low horizon, so Suffolk, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire provided ideal subjects. He and his wife returned to live permanently in Britain in 1945. On his return he acquired a motorbike and had removable carriers built for the pillion seat to accommodate his canvasses and paint box. Throughout the remainder of the 1940s he continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy and was elected president of the Sheffield Society of Artists in 1950. The Paris Salon awarded him the Silver Medal in 1951 and the Gold Medal in 1955. During this decade he visited Ireland, Scotland, Cornwall and again Brittany as he found the lighting effects of maritime subjects particularly inspiring. Brittany was his last overseas painting expedition. Thirty-nine of his paintings were accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy during his lifetime. Early in 1961, he was diagnosed with liver cancer and he died in March of that year. A memorial service was held at Worksop Priory, Nottinghamshire and his grave is in one of the town's cemeteries. In 1962, the Graves Art Gallery, part of the Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust, held a major retrospective exhibition of his work. 'Plein-air' Stanley Royle had a full and academic knowledge of every aspect of painting and it is this, combined with his extraordinary ability to capture the atmospheric quality of natural lighting on the landscape that makes his paintings so satisfying to the viewer. He thought nothing of pitching his easel in the middle of a stream and standing knee deep in water, whatever the weather, if that gave him the view he wanted to capture. He did not like the harsh lighting effects of the midday sun as it flattened the subject, but preferred early morning or mid to late afternoon and evening light. In conjunction with the 1988 centenary travelling exhibition held in Canada, Patrick Condon Laurette, the Curator of the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, published a book in 1989 entitled 'Stanley Royle (1888‚Äì1961)'. The next major publication solely dedicated to Stanley Royle's life and work was published in 2008, written by Timothy Dickson and published by Derwent-Wye Fine Art. It is an illustrated publication which also includes a full catalogue raisonn√© of the artists work. Further publications include 'Our Home and Native Land - Sheffield's Canadian Artists' by Mike Tooby, published in 1991 by the Sheffield Arts Department with funding from the Arts Council. Mike Tooby was the Keeper at the Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield. Subsequently he became the Curator at the Tate Gallery, St. Ives, Cornwall and is currently (2015) Professor of Art and Design at Bath School of Art and Design. His publication explores the work and relationships of Sheffield's Canadian Artists which included Arthur Lismer and Frederick H. Varley as well as Stanley Royle. In 1995, his daughter Jean Royle bequeathed her collection of Stanley Royle paintings to the Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust in order that future generations would have the opportunity of viewing, in one venue, the artist's work. This is of particular value since so many of his paintings are privately owned: however several British Collections own his works including the galleries at Rotherham, Oldham, Derby Art Gallery and the Glasgow Museum. These can be viewed at the Art UK web site. An exhibition of his work, The Great Outdoors - Paintings by Stanley Royle was held at Graves Art Gallery from December 2014 until May 2015.  The Royle Art Group  The Royle Art Group, based in Sheffield and founded in 1952, takes its name from the artist. The group is made up of admirers and former pupils of Stanley Royle and was originally known as the Royalist Art Group. ReferencesFurther reading *Patrick Condon Laurette.

He was the inaugural deputy leader of the Liberal Party (1945‚Äì1956), and a government minister under four prime ministers. He was later High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1956 to 1964. Harrison was born in Sydney and left school at the age of 13. He served with the Australian Army during World War I, and after the war's end became the manager of a textile factory. Harrison was elected to the House of Representatives in 1931, representing the United Australia Party (UAP). He served briefly as Minister for Interior in 1934, under Joseph Lyons, and returned to the ministry in 1938. Over the next three years he held positions in the governments of Lyons, Earle Page, Robert Menzies, and Arthur Fadden. In 1944, Harrison replaced Billy Hughes as deputy leader of the UAP. When the new Liberal Party was formed the following year, he was elected to the same position. In Menzies' second government, Harrison held various defence-related portfolios. He was also made the inaugural Leader of the House in 1951. Harrison left politics in 1956 to become High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. He retired in 1964, and suffered from Parkinson's disease in later years. His daughter, Shirley Walters, followed him into politics, becoming the first woman to represent Tasmania in the Senate. Early life Harrison was born in Surry Hills, Sydney, New South Wales, to Elizabeth Jane (n√©e Anderson) and Arthur Hoffman Harrison. His mother was born in Ireland, while his father ‚Äì who worked as a painter and decorator ‚Äì was born in England. Harrison attended the Crown Street Superior Public School until the age of thirteen, when he left school to work in the textile industry. He eventually became the manager of one of the factories owned by James Anderson Murdoch. In October 1916, Harrison joined the Australian Imperial Force and served on the Western Front from December 1917 in the 5th Field Artillery Brigade. He was promoted to sergeant in May 1918, and rowed in the Royal Henley Peace Regatta in 1919. After returning to Australia and taking his discharge, Harrison married Mary Cook McCall in 1920. Political career=1930s Although Harrison had not previously been politically active, in 1931 he established a branch of Joseph Lyons' All for Australia League in the Sydney suburb of Auburn, within Jack Lang's electorate, with police protection. In the December 1931 general elections he defeated Walter Marks for the House of Representatives seat of Wentworth, although both had been endorsed by the United Australia Party (UAP). He was appointed Minister for the Interior from 12 October 1934 in Lyons' second ministry, but lost the position on 9 November 1934 in Lyons' third Ministry, created to accommodate the Country Party. During this period he banned the entry of the Czechoslovakian anti-fascist campaigner, Egon Kisch into Australia. In November 1938, Harrison became Minister without portfolio administering External Territories, and in April 1939 was appointed Postmaster-General and Minister for Repatriation in Robert Menzies' first ministry, when the Country Party left the coalition. World War II When the Country Party returned to the Coalition in March 1940, Harrison was again left out of the ministry. He became Minister for Trade and Customs in Menzies third ministry in October 1940. He is notable for making available a newsprint ration for Ezra Norton's Daily Mirror in 1941, while tightening overall newsprint rationing. Harrison was a strong supporter of Menzies, as he continued to be after World War II. He went into opposition with the defeat of the Fadden government in October 1941 and almost lost his seat to suffragette and Australian Labor Party candidate Jessie Street in December 1943. Harrison was commissioned as an officer in the Militia in 1940 and in 1942 and 1943 he was a full-time liaison officer with the United States military forces in Australia. On one occasion he wore a uniform in Canberra, causing Eddie Ward to denounce him as a fake soldier and to accuse him of having been a member of the New Guard. His wife died in 1941 and in October 1944 he married Linda Ruth Yardley, n√©e Fullerton, a widow and a businesswoman. He became deputy leader of the UAP in April 1944. When the UAP was folded into the Liberal Party of Australia in late 1944, Harrison became its first deputy leader, holding the position until 1956. He was the longest serving Liberal Party Deputy Leader until his record was broken by Peter Costello in 2006. He was a vocal critic of the Curtin and Chifley governments. Post-war Sir Robert Menzies, Dame Enid Lyons, Sir Eric Harrison, Harold Holt and Sir Thomas White in 1946. Following the Liberal Party's win in the December 1949 election, Harrison became the third-ranking member of the government, behind Menzies and Country Party leader Arthur Fadden. He served as Minister for Postwar Reconstruction (until March 1950) and Minister for Defence in the Menzies ministry. From April 1950 until March 1951 he was resident in London, and in October 1950 he moved from the Defence portfolio to become Minister for the Interior. In May 1951, he became Minister for Defence Production and Vice-President of the Executive Council in Menzies' fifth ministry and the inaugural Leader of the House. From November 1955 to February 1956, he was also Minister for the Army and Minister for the Navy. Harrison was acting prime minister for two weeks in June 1954, when Menzies was in New Zealand and Fadden was recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident. Later life Harrison resigned from parliament in 1956 and became Australian High Commissioner in London, where he was an outspoken advocate of the \\"Old Commonwealth\\". The Harrisons returned to Australia in September 1964 and moved to the Sydney suburb of Castle Cove. He died at Chatswood of Parkinson's disease and was survived by his wife and the three daughters of his first marriage. One of his daughters was Shirley Walters, a Senator for Tasmania 1975‚Äì93. Honours Harrison was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1954 as a result of being minister in charge of the royal visit of Queen Elizabeth II. This was an honour within the Queen's personal gift. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1961 for his service as High Commissioner to the UK.

Naphthenic acids are represented by a general formula CnH2n-z O2, where n indicates the carbon number and z specifies a homologous series. The z is equal to 0 for saturated, acyclic acids and increases to 2 in monocyclic naphthenic acids, to 4 in bicyclic naphthenic acids, to 6 in tricyclic acids, and to 8 in tetracyclic acids. Salts of naphthenic acids, called naphthenates, are widely used as hydrophobic sources of metal ions in diverse applications.[2]Aluminium salts of naphthenic acid and palmitic acid were combined during World War II to produce napalm. The word \\"napalm\\" is derived from the words naphthenic acid and palmitic acid. Sources and occurrence The nature, occurrence, recovery and commercial uses of naphthenic acid have been reviewed. Crude oils from fields in Romania, Russia, Venezuela, the North Sea, China, and West Africa are known to be high in acidic compounds as compared to most American crude oils. The carboxylic acid content of certain California crude oils is particularly high (up to 4%) Conrad Environmental Aquatics Technical Advisory Group (CEATAG ) (1998). Naphthenic Acids Background Information Discussion Report, 65 pp. where the most abundant classes of carboxylic acids are reported to be cycloaliphatic and aromatic acids. The composition varies with the crude oil composition and the conditions during refining and oxidation.[3] Fractions that are rich in naphthenic acids can cause corrosion damage to oil refinery equipment; the phenomenon of naphthenic acid corrosion (NAC) has therefore been well researched.[4][5] Crude oils with a high content of naphthenic acids are often referred to as high total acid number (TAN) crude oils or high acid crude oil (HAC). Naphthenic acids are the major contaminant in water produced from the extraction of oil from Athabasca oil sands (AOS).[6] Naphthenic acids have both acute and chronic toxicity to fish and other organisms.[6] In their oft-cited article published in Toxicological Sciences Rogers et al. stated that \\"naphthenic acids are the most significant environmental contaminants resulting from petroleum extraction from oil sands deposits.\\" They found that \\"under worst-case exposure conditions, acute toxicity is unlikely in wild mammals exposed to naphthenic acids in AOS tailings pond water, but repeated exposure may have adverse health effects.\\"[7] In their 2002 article cited over 100 times, Rogers et al. reported on a solvent-based laboratory bench procedure developed to \\"efficiently extract naphthenic acids from bulk volumes of Athabasca oil sands tailings pond water (TPW).\\"[8] Naphthenic acids are present in AOS tailings pond water (TPW) at an estimated concentration of 81 mg/l, too low a level for TPW to be considered a viable source for commercial recovery. Using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] protocols for testing toxicity, McKee et al. (2014) argued that based on their studies refined NAs when consumed orally were not acutely genotoxic to mammals.[1] However, damage induced by NAs while transient in acute or discontinuous exposure, may be cumulative in repeated exposure.[7] Metal naphthenates Naphthenic acid is removed from petroleum fractions not only to minimize corrosion but also to recover commercially useful products. The greatest current and historical usage of naphthenic acid is in metal naphthenates. Naphthenic acids are recovered from petroleum distillates by alkaline extraction and then regenerated via an acidic neutralization process and then distilled to remove impurities. Naphthenic acids sold commercially are categorized by acid number, impurity level, and color, and used to produce metal naphthenates and other derivatives such as esters and amides. Naphthenates are the salts of naphthenic acids, analogous to the corresponding acetates, which are better defined structurally (because they crystallize readily). Such well-defined species however exhibit low solubility in hydrophobic medias such as paints. They are generally assumed have the formula M(naphthenate)2 or are basic oxides with the formula M3O(naphthenate)6. The naphthenates have industrial applications including synthetic detergents, lubricants, corrosion inhibitors, fuel and lubricating oil additives, wood preservatives, insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, wetting agents, thickening agent of napalm and oil drying agents used in painting and wood surface treatment. Industrially useful naphthenates include those of aluminium, magnesium, calcium, barium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, nickel, vanadium, and zinc.[2] Illustrative is the use of cobalt naphthenate for the oxidation of tetrahydronaphthalene to the hydroperoxide. Safety One oft-cited study stated that \\"naphthenic acids are the most significant environmental contaminants resulting from petroleum extraction from oil sands deposits.\\" However \\"under worst-case exposure conditions, acute toxicity is unlikely in wild mammals exposed to naphthenic acids in AOS tailings pond water, but repeated exposure may have adverse health effects.\\" Naphthenic acids are present in Athabasca oil sands (AOS) tailings pond water (TPW) at an estimated concentration of 81 mg/l. Using Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) protocols for testing toxicity, McKee et al. (2014) argued that based on their studies refined NAs when consumed orally were not acutely genotoxic to mammals. However, damage induced by NAs while transient in acute or discontinuous exposure, may be cumulative in repeated exposure.

The Foundation's goal is to provide equal educational opportunities to children aged 3‚Äì5 years, particularly in rural areas of high unemployment, in response to a dramatic decline in preschool education services in Poland. Only 38% of children aged 3‚Äì5 attended pre-school, which means that some 750,000 children in this age group is left out of pre-school care. In rural areas the attendance figure is below 10%. This is the lowest result in the whole European Union. The Foundation organises and conducts training for teachers, school and kindergarten headmasters, teachers and local educational authorities. The Foundation's \\"Where There Are No Pre-schools\\" programme aims at helping rural communities to develop new models for early-childhood education, based on local financial resources. A pilot scheme was set up in 28 rural communities, where 75 Early Childhood Education Centres have been set up, with over 800 children. Educational activities are provided by teachers trained by the Comenius Foundation to use the project approach in the classroom. The local authorities cover the costs of the teachers' salaries and the premises, whereas the Foundation is responsible for financing the teacher training, monitoring the quality of teaching and setting up local libraries. An external evaluation of the programme, commissioned by the Foundation, will enable modification while the programme is being implemented.

History The Llangollen Canal is the modern name for a canal which was originally part of the Ellesmere Canal. Construction of the Ellesmere Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793. By 1796, the company had opened two sections of canal, one from Chester to Ellesmere Port, which was very successful commercially, and the other was the Llanymynech Branch, which left the Chester Canal at Hurleston Junction, and passed through Whitchurch, Ellesmere and Frankton to reach Llanymynech. Ten years later, a total of of canal had been built, including a navigable feeder from Frankton to a little beyond Llangollen, which brought water from the River Dee, and was the main water supply for much of the network. The completion of this branch effectively created the junction. Many changes of ownership and name occurred, the first of which was the amalgamation of the Ellesmere and the Chester Canal companies to become the Ellesmere and Chester Canal in 1813. In 1845, this company amalgamated with the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which linked the southern terminus at Nantwich to Autherley Junction near Wolverhampton. In the following year, this company was renamed to become the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, which became part of the London and North Western Railway a few months later. The Montgomeryshire Canal was also authorised in 1793, but was never intended to reach Frankton Junction. It was an independent canal, which would run from Carreghofa, where the Ellesmere Canal's Llanymynech Branch terminated, southwards to Newtown. It opened from Carreghofa to Garthmyl in 1797, but a lack of finance meant that it was not completed to Newtown until 1821, and this final section was built by a third company. The section from Carreghofa to Garthmyl was known as the Eastern Branch, and the route onwards to Newtown as the Western Branch. The canal was never a financial success. The Eastern Branch became part of the Shropshire Union network in 1847, and the Western Branch did so in 1850. Trade on the Montgomery section declined rapidly in the 1920s, and the junction effectively closed in 1936, when a breach at Perry Aqueduct, to the south of the junction, resulted in the closure of the canal. In 1944, of the Shropshire Union network were abandoned by Act of Parliament, but the main line of the Shropshire Union Canal was retained, and the branch to Llangollen, through Frankton Junction, was also retained, because of its function as a water feeder. With the growth of the canal restoration movement, work began on what was then known as the Montgomery Arm of the Shropshire Union Canal, in 1969, when the bed of the canal was threatened by a bypass proposal in Welshpool. The whole branch became known as the Montgomery Canal when a formal restoration campaign was launched soon afterwards. Restoration hopes moved forwards in 1986, when British Waterways submitted a private bill to Parliament, to authorise full reconstruction of the canal, and Montgomeryshire County Council committed ¬£1 million, spread over five years, to fund repairs. The Bill became an Act of Parliament in late 1987, but not before Frankton Locks, which are situated immediately south of the junction, were reopened on 12 September. Prince Charles addressed the crowd on that occasion, mentioning that the restoration of the locks had been achieved by volunteers contributing 12,000 man-hours to the project, with a notional value of ¬£200,000. With the opening of the locks, the junction was again in use. Location Montgomery Canal milepost at the junction. The junction is located in Lower Frankton, although mileposts along the Montgomery Canal give distances to Welsh Frankton, which is the next nearest settlement. The Llangollen Canal is spanned by two bridges, one either side of the junction. To the east is Peter's Bridge, while to the west is Rowson's Bridge, where the towpath crosses from the north bank to the south bank for a short distance. The Frankton Locks, consisting of a staircase of two locks and two single locks, lower the level of the Montgomery Canal immediately south of the junction. A little further along the canal, a fifth lock is named after Graham Palmer, the founder of the Waterway Recovery Group, which was heavily involved in the reconstruction work. The lock has a small fall, and was inserted to compensate for changes in the ground level which had occurred since the canal was closed in 1936. From the junction, the canal is level towards Llangollen for a distance of , to the first of the two New Marton Locks. In the other direction, it is level through Ellesmere Tunnel, and passes the Ellesmere Arm, the Prees Branch and the Whitchurch Arm, before reaching the top lock of the six at Grindley Brook, from the junction. Bridge numbering As a result of the way in which the canals were built, and have subsequently been renamed, bridge numbering along the Llangollen Canal at Frankton Junction is not straightforward. The bridge to the east is numbered 69 (Peter's Bridge), then the bridge to the west of the junction (Rowson's Bridge) is numbered both 70 and 1. Further west, towards Llangollen, the bridge numbers continue as 2, 3, etc. Bridge number 71 (Lockgate Bridge) is located on what is now the Montgomery Canal, which uses bridge numbering starting with 71. The Llangollen Canal has, because of this, two separate series of bridge numbering, with one ending and the other beginning at Frankton Junction.

XEWK in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico and KEX in Portland, Oregon are the Class A stations on this frequency. WOWO in Ft. Wayne, Indiana is a former Class A station which was downgraded to Class B after its purchase by Inner City Broadcasting in New York, New York; this allowed WLIB to remain on the air 24 hours per day. History In 1958, the station first went on the air as WAGE, on 1290 kHz. The station was founded by Richard Field Lewis Jr., who also founded WINC in Winchester and WFVA in Fredericksburg. The original studio and transmitter site was a field behind Loudoun County High School in Leesburg. To this day, the street on which the studio stood is named Wage Drive. An anecdotal story claims that CBS newscaster and Leesburg resident Arthur Godfrey was the original owner, and the call sign stood for Arthur Godfrey Enterprises. In fact, the construction permit was owned by Lewis and passed to his widow upon his death in 1957. The callsign was reassigned from what is now WHEN in Syracuse, New York and was almost certainly sequential as it had no known meaning in either city. Once built, the station was sold first to William T. Stubblefield and again in 1962 to a group headed by James and Valeria Symington. In 1995, WAGE moved to 1200 kHz, allowing the use of a stronger full-time signal. WAGE was sold to WUST owner New World Radio Group, through its subsidiary Potomac Radio, Inc., in 2005. Local programming ended in 2007. On October 29, 2008, WAGE received a permit from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to move to 1190 kHz and increase its power to 50,000 watts. If the move had occurred, it would have caused Annapolis-based WBIS, currently on 1190 kHz, to shut down. While the station covered local news throughout its history, the music format changed over the years, going from classical music, to easy listening music, to country, to light rock and pop. Logo used until August 2009. On August 2, 2009, WAGE fell silent due to \\"tough economic conditions\\" and an ongoing attempt to move the station to AM 1190 and up the power to 50,000 watts. On April 21, 2010, the FCC approved WAGE's application to increase its daytime power to 50,000 watts and its nighttime power to 1,300 watts from different antenna sites, along with the frequency shift to 1190 kHz. The station was also forced to move out of Leesburg as the existing transmitter site was not large enough to accommodate the required towers. WCRW returned to the air on April 11, 2011, with programming from China Radio International (CRI), the Chinese state broadcaster. On November 2, 2015, it was reported that the FCC would investigate allegations that WCRW is controlled by CRI. At the same time, the United States Department of Justice announced an investigation to determine whether CRI was in compliance with legal obligations under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Reuters reported that 60 percent of the station's airtime is leased by a subsidiary of CRI. WCRW was granted 1.2 kW of night power in 2017, upgrading from class D to class B in the process. The station received permission to begin test operations at night on May 4, 2018.

History The Chester Canal was planned as a broad canal running from Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich. It was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1772, but the plans changed and the main line was built from Chester to Nantwich. Lack of finance prevented the construction of a branch to Middlewich. Commercially, the canal was a failure, and after opening in 1779, it lasted eight years until the company collapsed. However, it was reopened three years later in 1790, as the proposed construction of the Ellesmere Canal would make it part of a larger network, and might enable the Middlewich Branch, which would connect with the Trent and Mersey Canal to be built. The Ellesmere Canal as first envisioned was a huge undertaking, running from the River Mersey to the River Dee and on to Shrewsbury, with branches connecting Ruabon, Llangollen, Bersham, Llanymynech and possibly Whitchurch and Wem. William Jessop was asked to be engineer, and proposed some variations to the route. Opposing factions amalgamated in February 1793, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in April, which resulted in a line from Ellesmere Port to a junction with the Chester Canal opening in January 1797. Work started in early 1794 on a line from Hordley, near Frankton, to Llanymynech, after which it would be joined by the proposed Montgomeryshire Canal at Carreghofa. Llanymynech had extensive limestone quarries, which would provide trade for the canal. The branch was open by autumn 1796, and the first commercial use of the junction was thus in late 1796. The junction was originally a meeting point between the Chester Canal main line and the Ellesmere Canal branch to Llanymynech. In 1813, the two companies amalgamated, to become the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. In 1826, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal was authorised, which would link Nantwich to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley Junction near Wolverhampton. It opened in 1835, In 1845, a further amalgamation took place with this company, and shortly afterwards, it was renamed to become the Shropshire Union Canal. The Llangollen Canal was originally the Llangollen Branch, running from Frankton Junction on the Llanymynech Branch to Llangollen. The Llanymynech Branch closed below Frankton in 1936, following a breach at Perry Aqueduct. Much of the Shropshire Union system was closed by the owners, the London Midland and Scottish Railway, in 1944, but the main line was retained, and the line to Llangollen was retained as a water feeder. The whole length from Hurleston Junction to Llangollen has been rebranded as the Llangollen Canal, and the canal below Frankton Junction, all of which is now called the Montgomeryshire Canal, is being restored. Location From the junction, the Chester Canal runs to the north-west, and is level for to the two staircase locks at Bunbury. Barbridge Junction, where the Middlewich Branch turns off, was eventually built in 1833, is from the junction. Heading in the other direction towards Wolverhampton, the canal is level for to the bottom lock of the 15-lock Audlem flight. A roving bridge carries the towpath over the canal just to the south of the junction. Immediately after the junction, the Llangollen Canal rises through the four Hurleston locks, which raise the level of the canal by , beyond which the canal is crossed by the A51 road. To the north of the locks is Hurleston Reservoir, which is filled by water which passes along the canal from the Horseshoe Falls at Llantysilio. As well as supplying the canal, the reservoir is used for drinking water, holding 85 million gallons (390 Ml). Around 12 million gallons (55 Ml) flow along the canal each day to supply it.

Biography=Early recordings Lori Balmer was born in 1960, and started singing professionally at an early age. Her debut single, \\"Banjo Boy\\", was issued early in 1966, under the name Lori, via RCA Records and includes an orchestra directed by Tommy Tycho. She was reputed to be Australian RCA's youngest recording star at that time. Through her family connection to the Bee Gees members, she was offered two of Barry Gibb's songs, \\"Who's Been Writing on the Wall Again\\" and \\"In Your World\\", which she recorded at EMI's Sydney Studio. These were issued as her fourth single, in 1967. All three Gibb brothers provided vocal backing, and Barry Gibb was involved in the production. Lori was a model and was the face of \\"infanteen\\" as well as being the face to launch the Australian government's \\"wear a yellow raincoat\\" to protect children in the wet . International career In January 1968, following an invitation from Barry Gibb, Balmer travelled to England with her parents and they initially stayed with the Gibb family. She worked regularly on children's TV and radio shows, including The BBC 1 Club. The British press dubbed her the \\"bush baby\\" and she occasionally appeared on shows alongside the Bee Gees. In July 1968 she recorded two songs written by the Gibb brothers, \\"Treacle Brown\\" and \\"Four Faces West\\". All backing and production was provided by the Bee Gees with Bill Shepherd doing the arrangements. Balmer released it as a single via Polydor Records, in November 1968. The record demonstrated a voice more powerful than expected from someone so young, but legal problems prevented her from following it up with further material. In 1971 Balmer signed to Pye Records, with Tony Atkins producing her single, \\"Here Before the Sun\\", which appeared in 1972. She continued working in the UK, including as a support to the Marmalade, the Hollies, Johnny Mathis, and various artists in UK and the rest of Europe.

They were originally scheduled to be held in April and October 2014 in accordance with the Fatah‚ÄìHamas Gaza Agreement of April 2014. However, the elections were then delayed indefinitely. In October 2017, Hamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation deal in which Hamas agreed to dissolve the unity government in Gaza and hold general elections by the end of 2018, but the elections again were not held. Mahmoud Abbas announced on 26 September 2019 at a speech held at the UN General Assembly that he intends to set a date for elections once he returns to the West Bank. Hamas responded by indicating that it is ready to hold \\"comprehensive and general elections\\", but on 6 November Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) rejected Abbas's terms for holding elections, which required candidates to recognize the agreements signed by the PLO to be able to run. On 11 November 2019, Abbas said that there would be no new Palestinian elections unless they include east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. On 26 November 2019, Hamas confirmed that it had agreed with the Palestinian Central Elections Commission to participate in elections and that Hamas will not accept the exclusion of Jerusalem under any circumstances. Abbas announced in early December that elections will take place in a few months. On 10 December 2019, the Palestinian Authority asked Israel to allow East Jerusalem residents to vote in the planned elections, a request that Israeli officials said would now go to the security cabinet. Background Mahmoud Abbas was elected President of the Palestinian National Authority on 9 January 2005, for a four-year term ending on 9 January 2009. The last elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council were held on 25 January 2006. There have been no new elections either for president or for the legislature since these two elections; democratic elections in the State of Palestine since these dates have been for local offices only. Fatah‚ÄìHamas conflict In September 2008 it was suggested that Abbas' term be extended one year or that the Palestinian Legislative Council be dissolved a year early in order to hold both elections at the same time. Hamas objected to holding simultaneous elections, arguing that the presidential election should have been held in January 2009 and the parliamentary elections in 2010. Hamas also claimed that the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Aziz al- Dewik, who is a Hamas member, became the Palestinian president after Abbas' term ended on 9 January 2009, until new elections are held. Fatah argued that elections should have been held in January 2010, since the Palestinian election law calls for presidential and legislative council elections to be held simultaneously, four years after the date of the later. Since the legislative council elections were held in 2006 (a year after the presidential election), new elections for both should have been held in January 2010. In reconciliation talks held in Cairo, Egypt in March 2009, Hamas and Fatah agreed to hold the elections by 25 January 2010. In the end, because of the Fatah-Hamas conflict, the issue of new elections remained unresolved. In February 2010, local government elections were called in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for July 2010. The West Bank Palestinian government decided to postpone the elections, arguing that it wanted to safeguard \\"national unity\\". In December 2010, the Palestinian High Court of Justice ruled that once cabinet calls elections, it does not have authority to cancel them. After being postponed several times the local government elections took place in October and November 2012 and covered only the West Bank. Attempts to resolve election issue Presidential and parliamentary election to the Palestinian Authority were postponed several times because of intra- Palestinian political disputes between Fatah and Hamas, from the original date of 17 July 2010. In February 2011, following the resignation of Saeb Erekat as chief negotiator with Israel for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process following the release of the Palestine Papers, which were harshly critical of the PLO's concessions, the PLO Executive Committee announced intentions to hold elections before October. Abbas's followed the announcement with calls for \\"the spirit of change in Egypt\\" to inspire Palestinian unity. His aide Yasser Abed Rabbo said: \\"The Palestinian leadership decided to hold presidential and legislative elections within September. It urges all the sides to put their differences aside.\\" Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for Hamas, said that Abbas does not have the legitimacy to make the electoral call. \\"Hamas will not take part in this election. We will not give it legitimacy. And we will not recognize the results.\\" In October 2011, Abbas sent a proposal to Hamas for another general election, preferably to be held in early 2012. It was suggested that Hamas would be more willing to participate in another election following the Gilad Shalit prisoner swap, which boosted Hamas' standing in Gaza. In November 2011, an election date on 4 May 2012 was preliminarily agreed on. However, due to further bickering, the election could not be held by that date. On 20 December 2013 Hamas called on the Palestinian Authority to form a six-month national unity government that would finally hold the long-delayed general election.Llamado Hamas a Abbas por gobierno unitario Ansa, 20 December 2013 Following the upgrade of the UN status of Palestine to non-member observer state, it was proposed that general state elections would follow in 2013, in line with unity talks of Fatah and Hamas. In April 2014 agreement was reached between Fatah and Hamas to form a unity government, which took place on 2 June 2014, and for general elections to take place within 6 months of the agreement. Electoral law changes In 2007, President Mahmoud Abbas of the Fatah party unilaterally changed the electoral laws of 2005 from being half proportionally elected and half constituency/first past the post-based to full proportional representation. He insisted he could issue the change by decree as long as the Palestinian Legislative Council was unable to convene. The move was seen as a bid to lessen the chances of Hamas in the next election. Hamas, which controls the PLC, declared the move illegal. Presidential election Fatah renominated Abbas as their candidate for the next presidential elections in early June 2008, although reports in December suggested that he would not run for a second term. Rumours emerged again on 28 October 2009 of Abbas not running for another term; on 5 November he publicly announced his intention not to run for reelection, though he said he would stay until the next presidential election.

In his debut with Boston's major league club on May 2, 1995, he hurled six shutout innings in an 8-0 victory over the New York Yankees. In a three-season career, Eshelman posted a 15‚Äì9 record with a 6.07 ERA and 118 strikeouts and in 83 appearances, including 30 starts, 11 games finished, four shutouts, and 212 innings of work. He was sidelined during Spring Training in 1996 after a bizarre non-sports injury, burning his hands on a candle in his hotel room. His wife, Julie, was trying to warm a bottle for their baby son, Evan, when a washcloth caught fire. Eshelman suffered second-degree burns putting it out. The Red Sox waived Eshelman after the 1997 season, and he was picked up by the Oakland Athletics organization on October 15. A month later, on November 18, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected him in the 1997 expansion draft. He never pitched for Tampa Bay, but he later enjoyed minor league stints in the Cincinnati Reds organization in 2000, and the New York Mets organization in 2001. After baseball, Eshelman worked for Stanley, Black and Decker Tools and Fasteners as an area sales manager. In 2018, Eshelman's health started to decline, and he was in need of a liver transplant while he was hospitalized in Houston in February. After having a liver transplant on March 6, his father, Larry, stated that he had \\"a long, tough road ahead.\\" Eshelman died on July 24, 2018, at the age of 49. Personal life Eshelman was married to his high school sweetheart, Julie Menard, for over 25 years. They had two sons who played college baseball, Evan (Texas A&M;) and Ryan (Blinn College). His parents, Larry and Janet Eshelman of Cypress, Texas, and brothers Dain of Ocoee, Florida and Brian of Cypress, Texas, survived him. Another brother, Kyle, predeceased him.

He is the founder of The Atlantic Philanthropies, one of the largest private charitable foundations in the world. Feeney gave away his fortune in secret for many years, until a business dispute resulted in his identity being revealed in 1997. Feeney has given away more than $8 billion. Early life and education Feeney was born in New Jersey during the Great Depression and came from a modest background of blue collar Irish-American parents in Elizabeth, New Jersey. His ancestry can be traced to County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. Feeney graduated from Elizabeth's St. Mary of the Assumption High School in 1949; he has credited his charitable spirit to his education at St. Mary. His 2016 donation of $250,000 was the largest in the school's history from a single contributor.Haydon, Tom. \\"Billionaire remembers his Elizabeth high school with $250K donation\\", NJ Advance Media for NJ.com, November 12, 2016. Accessed January 6, 2017. \\"On Thursday, the international foundation Feeney started, Atlantic Philanthropies, gave $250,000 to his alma mater, St. Mary of Assumption High School in Elizabeth. The donation is the largest single contribution to the high school, St. Mary officials said. Feeney graduated from the school in 1949 and his desire to donating to others was inspired from his time at the school, Christopher Oechsli the president and CEO of the Atlantic Philanthropies, told St. Mary students.\\" He served as a U.S. Air Force radio operator during the Korean War, and began his career selling duty-free liquor to U.S. naval personnel at Mediterranean ports in the 1950s. He graduated from the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration and was a brother of Alpha Sigma Phi and honorary member of the Sphinx Head Society. Duty-Free Shoppers The concept of \\"duty-free shopping\\"‚Äîoffering high-end concessions to travelers, free of import taxes‚Äîwas in its infancy when Feeney and his college classmate Robert Warren Miller started selling duty-free liquor to American servicemen in Asia in the 1950s. They later expanded to selling cars and tobacco, and founded the Duty Free Shoppers Group (DFS Group) on November 7, 1960. DFS began operations in Hong Kong, later expanding to Europe and other continents. DFS' first major breakthrough came in the early 1960s, when it secured the exclusive concession for duty-free sales in Hawaii, allowing it to market its products to Japanese travelers. DFS eventually expanded to off-airport duty-free stores and large downtown Galleria stores and became the world's largest travel retailer. By the mid-1990s, DFS was distributing profits of up to $300 million a year to Feeney, Miller, and two smaller partners. \\"The rich returns came about in large part because DFS, like most other retailers in Asia, took a far higher markup on Western luxury items than was the case in Europe and the U.S. In New York, a retailer might price a designer handbag at 2.2 or 2.3 times the wholesale price. But in Asia, the retail price was a standard three times wholesale.\\" In 1996, Feeney and a partner sold their stakes in DFS to the French luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Mo√´t Hennessy (LVMH). Miller opposed the sale, and before a presumptive lawsuit could reveal that Feeney's stake was owned not in fact by him but by The Atlantic Philanthropies, Feeney outed himself in a The New York Times article written by Judith Miller. Atlantic made $1.63 billion from the sale. Philanthropy In 1982, Feeney created The Atlantic Philanthropies, and in 1984, secretly transferred his entire 38.75% stake in DFS, then worth about $500 million, to the foundation. Not even his business partners knew that he no longer personally owned any part of DFS. For years, Atlantic gave away money in secret, requiring recipients to not reveal the sources of their donations. \\"Beyond Mr. Feeney's reticence about blowing his own horn, 'it was also a way to leverage more donations‚Äì‚Äìsome other individual might contribute to get the naming rights.'\\" The largest single beneficiary of Feeney's giving is his alma mater Cornell University, which has received nearly $1 billion in direct and Atlantic gifts, including a donation of $350 million enabling the creation of Cornell's New York City Tech Campus on Roosevelt Island. Through Atlantic, he has also donated around $1 billion to education in Ireland, mostly to third-level institutions such as the University of Limerick and Dublin City University. Feeney has given substantial personal donations to Sinn F√©in, a left-wing Irish nationalist party that is historically associated with the IRA. He has also supported the modernization of public-health structures in Vietnam. In February 2011, Feeney became a signatory to The Giving Pledge. In his letter to Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, the founders of The Giving Pledge, Feeney writes, \\"I cannot think of a more personally rewarding and appropriate use of wealth than to give while one is living‚Äîto personally devote oneself to meaningful efforts to improve the human condition. More importantly, today's needs are so great and varied that intelligent philanthropic support and positive interventions can have greater value and impact today than if they are delayed when the needs are greater.\\" He gave away his last $7 million in late 2016, to the same recipient of his first charitable donations: Cornell. Over the course of his life, he has given away more than $8 billion. At its height, Atlantic had over 300 employees and 10 offices across the globe. In July 2017, The Atlantic Philanthropies noted the existence of an advance-fee scam email claiming to distribute money to \\"randomly selected individuals\\" worldwide, and using a link to the Wikipedia article to falsely verify the scammer's identity as \\"Charles Feeney\\". On September 14, 2020, Feeney closed down the Atlantic Philanthropies after the nonprofit accomplished its mission of giving away all of Feeney's money by 2020. Accolades Feeney has been called the \\"James Bond of philanthropy\\", for his secrecy and success. In 1997, Time said that \\"Feeney's beneficence already ranks among the grandest of any living American.\\" He has shunned publicity, although he cooperated in his 2007 biography, The Billionaire Who Wasn't: How Chuck Feeney Made and Gave Away a Fortune Without Anyone Knowing. Feeney is also the subject of a documentary by RT√â Factual, titled Secret Billionaire: The Chuck Feeney Story. In 2010 he received the Cornell Icon of Industry Award. In 2012, all the universities of Ireland, North and South, jointly conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Laws on Feeney. During the year, he also received Ireland's \\"Presidential Distinguished Service Award\\" for Irish Abroad. In 2012, he also was awarded the UCSF Medal for outstanding personal contributions to the University of California, San Francisco's health science mission. In 2014, Warren Buffett said of Feeney, \\"[he's] my hero and Bill Gates' hero. He should be everybody's hero.\\" On the 160th Anniversary of Queensland being created, June 6, 2019, Feeney was made an Honorary Queensland Great for his contribution to Queensland. Personal life Feeney has married twice. His first wife, Danielle, is French. They have four daughters, Juliette M. Feeney-Timsit, Caroleen A. Feeney, Diane V. Feeney, Leslie D. Feeney-Baily and one son, Patrick A. Feeney. His second wife, Helga, is his former secretary. He is known for his frugality. According to a The New York Times article in 2017, \\"Until he was 75, he traveled only in coach, and carried reading materials in a plastic bag.\\" Feeney is known for his frugality, living in a rented apartment, not owning a car or a house, flying economy-class and wearing a $10 Casio F-91W watch.Taoiseach launches Chuck Feeney Biography at Trinity College Dublin As of 2016, he lived in a rented apartment in San Francisco, with a remaining nest egg of $2 million.

Zawahiri began by condemning the Pakistani military's July assault on Islamic militants who took over the Red mosque, and paid tribute to one of the militants' leaders, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who was killed in the fighting. The siege \\"revealed the extent of the despicableness, lowliness and treason of Musharraf and his forces, who don't deserve the honour of defending Pakistan, because Pakistan is a Muslim land, whereas the forces of Musharraf are hunting dogs under Bush's crucifix\\", Zawahiri said.

June 2, 2009  Al-Zawahiri released the message one day before Osama Bin Laden released his message. In the message, he criticized US President Barack Obama, saying he was not welcome in Egypt, where he went to give a speech.  July 14, 2009  In this tape, al- Zawahiri urges Pakistanis to support the Taliban.The Nation (Pakistan) 15 July 2009  December 14, 2009  In an audio recording released on December 14, 2009, Zawahiri renewed calls to establish an Islamic state in Israel and urged his followers to ‚Äúseek jihad against Jews‚Äù and their supporters. He also called for jihad against America and the West, and labeled Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, King Abdullah II of Jordan and King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia as the ‚Äúbrothers of Satan.‚ÄùAnti-Defamation League: \\"Al Qaeda Second-in-Command Calls for ‚ÄòJihad against Jews‚Äô‚Äù December 17, 2009  May 20, 2010  In an audio recording released on May 20, 2010 that the recently slain leaders of the group's offshoot in Iraq Abu Ayyub al-Masri and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi. It was the first message broadcast since December. Al-Zawahiri likened the slain leaders to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian-born militant who created the group and was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, crediting them with reviving jihad, or holy war, in Iraq.  July 20, 2010  In an audio tape al-Zawahiri slammed Arab leaders as \\"Zionists\\" who are helping Israel's siege of the Gaza Strip. He also mocked US President Barack Obama for saying that the Taliban will not gain power in Afghanistan, hailing at the same time, the \\"victory\\" of the Islamist militant group against coalition forces. \\"These Arab Zionists are more dangerous than Jewish Zionists,\\" Zawahiri said in the audiotape posted on an Islamist website that stated the message was produced by Al-Qaeda's Al-Fajr media arm. He hit out at Egypt in particular for planning to build an underground metal fence with Gaza to curb cross-border smuggling. \\"Who is besieging our people in Gaza and is surrounding them with an underground metal fence? Is he not the chief of Arab Zionists (Egyptian President) Hosni Mubarak?\\" he charged. \\"This metal fence is a shame for the people of Egypt who let the chief of Arab Zionists besiege their brothers,\\" in Gaza, he added. He went on to accuse Jordan's king Abdullah II, Saudi King Abdullah and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas of being \\"Zionists.\\" \\"Who is providing his intelligence service to serve US intelligence and (Israel's) Mossad? Is he not the heir of traitors, Abdullah, the son of (late King) Hussein\\" of Jordan, he said. \\"And who is aiding Mossad to kill the Mujahedeen (holy warriors) and capture them? Is he not the Arab Zionist Mahmoud Abbas?,\\" he charged. \\"And who presented an initiative (for Middle East peace), following the directions of Jewish (US journalist) Thomas Friedman, and organised an inter-faith dialogue conference where he shook hands with (Israeli President Shimon) Peres? Is he not the Arab Zionist Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz?,\\" he added. He slammed Arab leaders collectively for backing the Saudi-drafted peace initiative, which was first presented in 2002, offering Israel full recognition in return for its withdrawal from the occupied territories and a just settlement for refugees. \\"Who were those who agreed collectively to hand most of Palestine to the Jews, and said that the refugees issue can only be settled in arrangements with the Jews? \\"Were they not the Arab rulers in their shameful initiative,\\" he asked. In his new tape, he also lashed out at Obama.\\"Poor Obama comes to Kabul pledging that Taliban will not return to power... Poor you, can you promise that your herds (of soldiers) will return safe to America?,\\" he charged.\\"You threaten the Taliban, you are just a puppet of the tyrants... We will see who will not return to Kabul because he will flee it hastily in fear.\\"\\"Obama, whether you admit it or not, Muslims have defeated you in Iraq and Afghanistan and will defeat you in Palestine, Somalia and the Islamic Maghreb,\\" he added.He hailed Taliban's military action against coalition forces in the south of Afghanistan, congratulating its leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, on his \\"steadfastness\\" and vowing allegiance to him as \\"the leader of the believers.\\"\\"Congratulations to the Muslim Ummah (nation)... and to the leader of the believers, the patient mujahed, Mulla Umar... the imminent victory, \\" he said.\\"Before that, congratulations on your steadfastness against infidels and tyranny,\\" he added.\\"We renew our vow of allegiance to you... on the path of jihad (holy war) in the name of Allah,\\" he said.  July 27, 2010  In the 47-minute recording, Ayman al-Zawahiri said the drive by France and other European nations to ban the veil amounted to discrimination against Muslim women. He slammed France's push to ban the Islamic full-face veil and urged Muslim women to be \\"holy warriors\\" in the defense of their headdress against the \\"secular Western crusade\\" in a new audio message released Wednesday on militant websites. Al-Qaida's deputy leader also eulogized the network's No. 3 official, Mustafa al-Yazid, who was killed along with his family in a U.S. strike in Pakistan in May. Al-Zawahiri praised what he called al-Yazid's achievements in Afghanistan and claimed that although killed al-Qaida militants in Iraq outnumber U.S. soldiers 100-to-1, it is the U.S. that is withdrawing its troops from Iraq. He said the latest terror attacks against the United States, including a May 1 attempted car bombing in New York city's busy Times Square, were in response to the presence of foreign troops in Muslim nations like Iraq and Afghanistan. In his audiotape, al-Zawahiri also talked about a wide range of topics in the Middle East such as democratic reforms in his native Egypt. He said that holy war was the only way to achieve reforms, not peaceful calls for reforms or elections. Al-Zawahiri also addressed Yemenis, urging them to wage attacks against U.S. targets and the Yemeni government.  August 15, 2010  In a 20-minute Arabic audio message posted on an Islamist website on Sunday, al-Zawahiri also offered condolences to the families of Turkish activists killed by Israel during a raid on a Gaza bound aid flotilla. He called on Turks to pressure their government to end relations with the Jewish state. He accused Turkey of killing Muslims in Afghanistan.  September 15, 2010  In his new audio tape he made a thinly veiled call on Pakistanis to rise up against their government over what he said was the \\"failure\\" of authorities there to provide relief to flood victims. Ayman al-Zawahiri also accused the Islamabad government of corruption. Al-Zawahiri directed his harshest criticism at Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, describing him as a \\"thief\\" too preoccupied with mending his ties with the West to care about flood victims at home.  November 4, 2010  In an audio tape called on Muslims on Thursday to avenge the sentencing of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani scientist jailed for 86 years by a US court, the SITE monitoring service said. Made the appeal in an audio message called \\"Who Will Avenge the Scientist Aafia Siddiqui,\\" which was released on jihadist forums, the SITE Intelligence Group said. He promised \\"to attack ‚Ä¶ (Americans) as long as they attack\\" Muslims and said \\"the ummah (Islamic nation) will not stop pursuing you.\\" And al-Zawahiri told Pakistanis their \\"government humiliated them by letting the Americans and Crusaders occupy the country.\\" He called for them to \\"take the only available path, that of jihad... which will liberate Aafia Siddiqui.\\"  February 4, 2011  An audio message from Osama bin Laden's terrorist deputy was released on the internet, the first message from al Qaeda since the unrest in Egypt began. The 34-minute message from Ayman al-Zawahiri addressed the corruption of the Egyptian regime and denounced the government of President Hosni Mubarak for resisting Islamic law.  February 27, 2011  Al-Qaeda's Egyptian-born number two Ayman al-Zawahiri has said the United States is installing sympathetic new regimes in Tunisia and Egypt, demanding Muslims rise up against \\"whippers\\" and \\"invaders\\". Railing against Washington, Zawahiri also said Tunisians should resist \\"the French occupier\\" and establish \\"a rule that will be a role model of counselling and justice for your brothers\\". The United States had abandoned Tunisia's long-time president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in mid-January when it became clear that he had become a liability, the fugitive deputy to Al-Qaeda supremo Osama bin Laden said. Zawahiri said a \\"secular alternative\\" was emerging in the shape of Mohamed ElBaradei, the former Vienna-based UN atomic chief.  April 14, 2011  Al-Zawahiri incites Muslims to rise up against both NATO and Muammar Gaddafi's forces in a newly released video apparently taped before the Western intervention in Libya. Zawahiri, wearing a white robe, was speaking in a one-hour and nine minute video produced by Al-Qaeda's media arm, as-Sahab, according to the US-based SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamic extremist websites. SITE said Zawahiri split his lecture into three distinct parts, addressing in turn the uprisings in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia. Zawahiri stated Al-Qaeda's backing for the ousted Tunisian and Egyptian presidents and also accused the Egyptian government of \\"separation from Islam\\" and \\"subservience to the West,\\" the monitoring group said. The video was the fifth installment in Egyptian-born Zawahiri's series titled \\"A Message of Hope and Glad Tidings to Our People in Egypt. Zawahiri's latest video concluded with an excerpt of a previously- released video message from US-Yemeni cleric and terror suspect Anwar al- Awlaqi, SITE said.  May 22, 2011  Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda's long- time number two to Osama bin Laden, has in his latest audio message backed the wave of Arab revolts and called for sharia law in Egypt. In a three-part audio message which the jihadist network's media arm Al-Sahab said was recorded before US forces killed bin Laden on May 2, Zawahiri addressed the populations of Libya, Syria and Egypt in turn. SITE Intelligence, which monitors jihadist Internet forums, said the Egyptian militant warned Libyans the NATO-led aerial bombing campaign against Moamer Kadhafi seeks to replace the strongman with its own tyrannical regime. He also called upon the Muslims of North Africa to join the fight against Kadhafi and to obtain weapons, while criticising Egypt's military for not coming to the aid of Egyptian expatriates residing in Libya. He also briefly addressed Syrians, calling on them to continue their uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime and to ignore the words of support offered by Americans, whom Zawahiri argues have been allied with the regime in the war on terror.  June 8, 2011  In his first video message since the death of Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri warned that bin Laden would continue to \\"terrify\\" the US from beyond the grave. Notably however, he did not stake a claim to take over as head of al-Qaeda.Al-Qaeda‚Äôs Zawahiri appears on video but doesn‚Äôt assert leadership ‚Äì Washington Post, 9 June 2011 He also backed the wave of Arab unrest, calling for Sharia Islamic law to be applied in Egypt, but warned Libyans that NATO's bombing campaign aimed to replace Muammar Gaddafi with a Western-backed tyrannical regime. The statement was posted on Jihadist websites.Al-Qaeda posts fresh warning from al-Zawahiri to US ‚Äì BBC News, 9 June 2011  July 28, 2011  Al-Zawahiri is claiming solidarity with Syria's pro-democracy movement, while urging protesters there to direct their anti-government uprising also against the United States and Israel. In a video message posted on Islamist websites Wednesday, Ayman al- Zawahiri directly addressed the Syrian demonstrators who have risen up against President Bashar al-Assad's rule despite a bloody government crackdown. The Egyptian-born Zawahiri accused Mr. Assad of being a corrupt tyrant and ‚ÄúAmerica's partner in the war on Islam.‚Äù He claimed that Washington wants to replace Mr. Assad with ‚Äúa new ruler who follows America protects Israel's interests.‚Äù  August 14, 2011  On August 14, al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to target the United States and avenge the killing of his predecessor Osama bin Laden, the SITE Intelligence Group reported Monday. SITE, quoting a video posted on jihadist online forums, said the new head of Al-Qaeda asking Muslims to \\"pursue\\" the United States over the killing of Bin Laden. It was a 12-minute video addressed. \\"The Muslim movement in general and the jihadi movement in particular should wage the battle of intellectual argument just as much as the battle of weapons,\\" he said.  September 13, 2011  al- Zawahiri released a tape called \\"The Dawn of Imminent Victory,\\" which was posted on jihadist websites. It also includes footage of bin Laden, warning Americans against \\"falling as slaves\\" to corporations. SITE said that the footage of Osama appeared to be the same material found in the US raid on his Pakistan hideout in May, which Washington released, but without its soundtrack. It said that the 62-minute video featured al-Zawahiri (now the US's most wanted man) applauding the Arab Spring revolutions. \\"Zawahiri... declared that, contrary to what is reported in the media, al-Qaeda supports the revolutions and hopes it will establish true Islam and Sharia-based governance,\\" AFP news agency quoted Site as saying. \\"The popular revolutions, he stated, are a form of defeat for the United States, just as the 9/11 attacks and its alleged lack of success in Afghanistan and Iraq were also defeats.\\"  November 15, 2011  Osama has been described as \\"tender\\" and \\"kind\\" in a video released by the new head of al-Qaeda. The video (called \\"Days with the Imam: Part One\\") lasts about 30 minutes. It has been posted on jihadist websites. al-Zawahiri said that he'd created the video to show bin Laden's \\"human side\\" and tell people about his great loyalty. \\"People don't know that this man was tender, gentle, kind, with refined feelings, even when life was hard,\\" al-Zawahiri says in the video, dressed in a white robe and turban and sitting in front of a green curtain. He recalls how Osama reacted when he received the news that some members of al-Zawahiri's family had been killed. With tears in his eyes, Osama came to see Ayman and hugged him. He adds that Osama was devoted to his children, paying great attention to ensuring that they were well-educated, despite constantly moving from place to place. Osama, he said, didn't want those who carried out the September 11 attacks to be forgotten. \\"Everyone close to him saw the fine and noble education in his children,\\" he said, adding that Osama employed a teacher who would threaten to beat the children with a stick to teach them the Koran.  December 1, 2011  al-Zawahiri claimed that al-Qaeda had kidnapped a 70-year-old American in Lahore in August. He demanded the release of Ramzi Yousef, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, and others as well as the end of air strikes in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Gaza in exchange for Warren Weinstein's release.Al-Qaeda takes credit for kidnapping U.S. development expert Warren Weinstein, Reuters in National Post, December 1, 2011 al- Zawahiri also confirmed the death of Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, an al-Qaeda leader killed in a U.S. drone strike.Al-Qaeda says it kidnapped Warren Weinstein in Pakistan, BBC, December 1, 2011  February 9, 2012  al-Shabaab and al- Qaeda have announced their formal merger (according to a video disseminated online and translated by the SITE Institute). In the video, Moktar Ali Zubeyr pledges his organization's allegiance to al-Qaeda and Ayman al-Zawahiri accepts.  February 12, 2012  al-Zawahiri in a video recording posted on the Internet on Sunday, urged Syrians not to rely on the West or Arab governments in their uprising to topple President Bashar al-Assad. In the 8-minute video (called \\"Onwards, Lions of Syria\\" and posted on an Islamist website), al-Zawahri also urged Muslims in Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan to come to the aid of Syrian rebels confronting Assad's forces. al-Zawahiri said, \\"A Muslim should help his brothers in Syria with all that he can, with his life, money, opinion, as well as information.\\"  May 9, 2012  In a seven-minute message video posted on a Jihadi website, Zawahiri rejected the US apology over the burning of Quran copies at a base in Afghanistan, urging all Muslims to support the Taliban.  May 11, 2012  Al-Zawahiri released a video in which he encouraged Somali militants to fight on despite the challenges. He urged al-Shabab militants not to be deterred by U.S. drone attacks.  August 2, 2013  Purported al-Zawahiri message criticizes Mohammad Morsi's ouster.  September 4, 2014  He announced the creation of the branch on the Indian subcontinent to \\"raise the flag of jihad\\" across South Asia including India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. In the 55-minute video posted online, Zawahiri pledged renewed loyalty to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar.  August 13, 2015  In an audio recording al-Zawahiri gave condolences for the deceased Mullah Omar, and pledged allegiance to his successor, Akhter Mansour.  July 1, 2016  In a video, al-Zawahri warns the United States of the \\"gravest consequences\\" if Muslim prisoners in that country are executed. He specifically names Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is facing the death sentence for his involvement in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.  July 8, 2019  In a video titled, 'Don't forget Kashmir', Zawahiri urged unification of Jihadis and freeing from the clutches of unjustified Pakistan. He further criticized Pakistan and its role.

In 1930 Durban returned to Britain, and in 1931 she joined the South Atlantic Division. By December 1933, she was relieved by the heavy cruiser and again returned to home waters. In March 1934, Durban left for Gibraltar to join the Mediterranean Fleet. She spent two years on this station, returning to Britain in September 1936 to be placed into reserve. Wartime service On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Durban was recommissioned and assigned to the 9th Cruiser Squadron under the Commander- in-Chief, South Atlantic. In March 1940 she was operating in the Indian Ocean and was then transferred to the Eastern Fleet based at Singapore. Here she became a unit of the British Malaysian Force with her two sister ships, and . The unit kept watch on German merchant ships in the Dutch East Indies harbours, with Durbans patrol area being off Padang. On 10 November 1940 the Norwegian tanker Ole Jacob reported being attacked by the German raider between Ceylon, and the north end of Sumatra. A force was hastily assembled, comprising Durban, the cruiser and the Australian cruiser and armed merchant cruiser to hunt for Atlantis. The task force was however unable to locate the raider. In 1941 Durban, with her sister , was escorting convoys between Singapore and the Sunda Strait. In February, she escorted the ocean liner , then carrying Second Australian Imperial Force troops for Malaya, into Singapore, arriving on 18 February.

Durban was damaged by bombing before she could leave, but on 12 February she and the anti-submarine vessel escorted the merchant ships and out of Singapore, repelling successive Japanese air attacks for four hours. The next day the convoy, carrying thousands of evacuees from Singapore, reached Tandjong Priok, the port for Batavia. Durban, with Admiral Thomas C. Hart as a passenger, departed 16 February escorting carrying refugees to Colombo. There Durban underwent temporary repairs.

In November, she once again returned to Britain to be paid off into the reserve. She was then one of the ships selected to be scuttled to form a breakwater for the Mulberry harbours that would be used to support the Battle of Normandy.

The gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that will appear on the screen; this text represents either dialogue between the various characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a \\"decision point\\" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. In order to view the five plot lines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points in order to further the plot in an alternate direction. The game begins with a choice of three modes: Amusement, Feeling, and Only One. Amusement Mode is intended for beginners where each of the heroines will have a favorable impression, and an icon on the screen shows the player how far in the game they have progressed. The Feeling Mode does not have an icon to show how far the player has progressed, and is seen as the typical setting for an adult visual novel. The last mode, Only One, starts with a selection for the player to choose one of the five heroines. Whichever girl the player chooses will determine which route the player will experience. Plot=Story HoneyComing's story revolves around the protagonist K≈çichir≈ç Ogata, a male first-year high school student who does not have any interest in matters such as love or romance. The high school he is admitted to, named , used to be an all-girl school formally named , and still carries a high population of female students.

These lessons are known as , and students at Aiky≈ç are required to take these classes on how to fall in love, and the ways of proper romance techniques. Each lesson, two people (of the opposite sex) pair up to make something, such as a meal for example, and they must form good communication if they intend to pass the test. There are also tests on practical skills which required note taking to later be studied for tests. During these lessons, students from Aiky≈ç, and a nearby affiliated junior-high school, are combined for a total range of six grades from the lowest to the highest.

The culture, which is part of the Danube civilization, is considered the largest and most important of the Azmak River Valley agrarian settlements.  Discovery  Venus of Karanovo stratigraphy Archaeologists discovered the Karanovo settlement in the 1930s when a tell - a settlement mound - was excavated at Karanovo. The hilltop settlement is constituted of 18 buildings, which housed some 100 inhabitants. The site was inhabited more or less continuously from the early 7th to the early 2nd millennia BC. The Karanovo culture served as the foundation of the East Balkan cultural sequence. The layers at Karanovo are employed as a chronological system for Balkans prehistory. This culture had seven major phases: Karanovo I and II, which existed parallel to Starƒçevo; Karanovo III (Veselinovo); Karanovo IV; Karanovo V (Marica); Karanovo VI (Gumelni≈£a); and, Karanovo VII, which emerged during the Early Bronze Age.  Characteristics  Some of the main characteristics of the Karanovo culture are the white-painted pottery and dark-painted vessels obtained from the tell. These artifacts were particularly associated with the first and second phases. There is also the Karanovo macroblade technology, which featured semi-steep and steep retouching as well as the use of yellow flint with white spots. This particular technology, which is also known as \\"Karanovo blade\\", emerged during the culture's early Neolithic phase. Scholars note its interesting length and width: 100 mm long and between 15 mm and 23 mm wide. Karanovo II is distinguished from its predecessor due to its influence on the Thracian culture, or the assimilation of its elements into those inherited from Karanovo I. The basic characteristics of this phase continued until Karanovo III and were particularly pronounced in its coarsely made ware such as pitchers, shallow dishes and cylindrical vases (e.g. K√ºgel).

History The six pack rings in most common use today are the descendants of an original design by ITW Hi-Cone, which first introduced them in St. Louis, Missouri in the summer of 1960.ITW History Within 10 years, plastic rings had completely replaced the paper and metal based holders then common in the market. Today several other manufacturers continue to produce six pack rings. Though interest in multi-packs has continued to grow, other variations, including paperboard baskets and HDPE plastic can carriers have grown in popularity, providing an alternative to conventional six pack rings. Environmental concerns Since the late 1970s, six pack rings grew to fame as a dangerous form of marine litter, as marine wildlife were found entangled in the rings with a disabling or lethal result. It is recommended that each loop be cut so that no entanglement can occur. In a cleanup of an Oregon beach in 1988, 1,500 six-pack rings were picked up by volunteers in a few hours. The production of the plastic rings also uses petroleum oil. The first law banning non-degradable ring carriers was in the US state of Vermont in 1977, and by 1991 27 states had followed suit. A biodegradability performance standard was recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1993, following the findings that non-degradable ring carriers had been found in great quantities in the marine environment where they persisted for decades and threatened marine life. In 1994 The US Federal Regulation proposed that all plastic rings carriers be naturally degradable materials, applying to all importers and processors. Many manufacturers do this by using photodegradable material, which can take months to break down. However, the fragments and microplastics resulting from the decomposition process can still be eaten by animals. In 2010, Saltwater Brewery developed eco-friendly rings that are biodegradable and compostable. In 2018 Carlsberg Breweries announced the use of a new type of glue, which took 3 years to make, that would hold their beers together instead of plastic rings. Compared to fishing gear, cigarette butts and other plastic wastes, six-pack rings are a smaller contributor to marine litter.

On 4‚Äì5 January 1919, right-wing National Democrats attempted to overthrow the government of Jƒôdrzej Moraczewski and J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. The coup's leaders included Marian Januszajtis-≈ªegota and Prince Eustachy Sapieha. The coup forces succeeded in arresting Moraczewski's government but not Pi≈Çsudski. Some military units refused to follow confusing or surprising orders, and eventually the coup ended in some arrests and in a return to the status quo ante. There were no fatalities or significant injuries. In mid- January, right-wing activists were admitted to membership in a coalition government. Background In the aftermath of the First World War, Poland regained independence. One of the task it faced was creation of a new government. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, leader of Polish Legions, became the chief of state (Naczelnik pa≈Ñstwa) on the authority of the Regency Council, but instead of the coalition government expected by many, he supported a left-wing government of Jƒôdrzej Moraczewski. Moraczewski's reforms, such as the 8-hour work day and the creation of a worker's militia, led to unrest among the right-wing politicians, and the issue was compounded by highly controversial decisions of some left-wing local activists, in some cases bordering on support for communism (for example, some factories were temporarily nationalized). Pr√≥ba zamachu stanu w Polsce. Retrieved on 20 September 2007 Preparations Unrest spread through some of the officers of the Polish Army in the Warsaw district. Eventually several high-ranking officers and politicians (Marian Januszajtis-≈ªegota, Tadeusz Dymowski, Jerzy Zdziechowski, Witold Zawadzki, Eustachy Sapieha) decided to stage a coup - arrest Moraczewski and Pi≈Çsudski, and in their place, introduce a right-wing government under Roman Dmowski and J√≥zef Haller. Bohdan Urbankowski, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski: marzyciel i strateg, (J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski: Dreamer and Strategist), Tom pierwszy (first tome), Wydawnictwo ALFA, Warsaw, 1997, , p. 499-501 The coup The rebels divided their forces into three groups. First unit, with the coup leaders, took the Town Hall at Saxon Square, where they established their command center. As neither Dmowski nor Haller were in Poland (they were in France, attending the Treaty of Versailles negotiations), Sapieha and Januszajtis-≈ªegota declared that they were assuming the leadership of the country. They also sent a squad general Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki, and for the 21st Infantry Regiment, whose command supported the coup, to report to the Town Hall. Szeptycki however was first informed of the events by an officer who escaped from the Town Hall; then arrested by a rebel squad, and finally freed by his own soldiers. Investigating the matter, he arrived at the Town Hall, where he was in no mood for supporting the rebels: instead, as a ranking officer on the scene, he took command of the 21st Regiment and ordered the troops to siege the Town Hall. Hence, the coup leaders found themselves besieged by the very troops they intended to use to cement their victory. The rebel unit tasked with arresting members of Moraczewski succeeded in arresting the ministers, although they failed to assassinate Minister of the Interior, Stanis≈Çaw Thugutt. The third group, tasked with arresting Pi≈Çsudski, tried to bluff their way into the Belweder Palace where Pi≈Çsudski had his office and living quarters. Once inside, they declared their intent to arrest Pi≈Çsudski - and promptly found themselves locked inside one of the rooms by staff loyal to Pi≈Çsudski. Next day, members of Moraczewski's were freed, and most of the coup supporters surrendered to the government forces. Aftermath Thugutt suggested that coup leaders should be tried, but Pi≈Çsudski objected - not wanting to risk increasing unrest and turning them into martyrs; he believed that in any case the right-wing has lost much face with the unsuccessful coup. Negotiations started, and two weeks after the coup, Moraczewski's government resigned, and a new government, including right-wing politicians, was formed by Ignacy Paderewski. Most of the people involved in the coup were not punished; prince Sapieha became an ambassador to United Kingdom, and Januszajtis-≈ªegota, a province governor.

It was built in 1795 by Jacob Broom, one of the Delaware signers of the United States Constitution. The house was purchased in 1802 by √âleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont, progenitor of the prominent Du Pont family and founder of the DuPont chemical concern, who established the Eleutherian Mills below the house on the banks of Brandywine Creek. The house, which remains in the hands of Du Pont descendants, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974, for its association with Broom. and Description and history The Jacob Broom House is located northwest of Wilmington, Delaware, on a terrace overlooking Brandywine Creek southeast of the village of Montchanin. It is located between the two portions of the Hagley Museum and Library, which commemorates the early industrial history of the du Pont family. The main portion of the house is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, with a dormered gable roof and end chimneys. The main facade is four bays wide, with the entrance in the center-left bay. Jacob Broom (1752-1810) was born in Wilmington, trained as a surveyor, and had a long and varied career, operating a number of business ventures. In 1787 he was elected one of Delaware's delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, which drafted the United States Constitution. In 1795 he acquired about of land on the west bank of Brandywine Creek, and established a cotton mill, building a long stone- lined raceway and dam. This house was built on a terrace overlooking the mill site, and is the only significant structure remaining that was associated with Broom's life. Broom's mill burned after a few years, and Broom sold the entire property in 1802 to √âleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont, a French immigrant. Du Pont brought with him detailed knowledge on the production of gunpowder, and soon established a powder mill on the property, using this house as an early residence and business headquarters. Successful in his business, du Pont later built the mansion house that is now part of the Hagley Museum complex. This house was occupied by Eleuthera du Pont Smith and her husband, Thomas Mackie Smith, until 1873, and by Francis G. du Pont until 1919. During Francis' occupation, the house underwent significant additions, giving it a distinctly Victorian character while maintaining the core structure. The DuPont company purchased the building in 1919, and sold it in 1933 to Irene du Pont, who purchased it for her daughter. The house remains in the family as a private residence, but most of the Victorian alterations have been removed, and more stylistically sympathetic additions have been made to it.

The series was filmed in Hollywood by Revue Studios. The pilot for Shotgun Slade aired earlier in 1959 on CBS's Schlitz Playhouse. Overview After several years of total saturation on the networks, many western series began to lose popularity with viewing audiences, Shotgun Slade had three characteristics that made it unique. The first was Slade's profession. Instead being a marshal, sheriff or wandering gunfighter, Slade was a private detective, hired by individuals to track down criminals, return stolen money, or perform other similar duties. This was obviously influenced by the growing popularity of television private eyes such as Peter Gunn, Richard Diamond, Private Detective, 77 Sunset Strip, and Hawaiian Eye. Another quirk was Slade's weapon of choice. Instead of packing a six gun, Slade carried a combination shotgun that has an upper and lower barrel. The lower barrel fired a 12-gauge shotgun shell, while the top barrel fired a .32 caliber rifle bullet. The idea was that this weapon gave Slade the ability to fire at close and distant targets with the same amount of accuracy. Several western television shows were known for featuring distinctive weapons, such as those on shows like The Rifleman, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Wanted: Dead or Alive, Johnny Ringo, and The Rebel, but Slade's shotgun stood out even among the weapons of those other shows. Despite the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the series, Shotgun Slade lasted for only two seasons.

They represent a graphical alternative to Backus‚ÄìNaur form or to EBNF as metalanguages. Early books using syntax diagrams include the \\"Pascal User Manual\\" written by Niklaus Wirth Niklaus Wirth: The Programming Language Pascal. (July 1973) (diagrams start at page 47) and the Burroughs CANDE Manual.Burroughs B6700/B7700 Command AND Edit (CANDE) Language: Information Manual. In the compilation field, textual representations like BNF or its variants are usually preferred. BNF is text-based, and used by compiler writers and parser generators. Railroad diagrams are visual, and may be more readily understood by laypeople, sometimes incorporated into graphic design. The canonical source defining the JSON data interchange format provides yet another example of a popular modern usage of these diagrams.  Principle of syntax diagrams  The representation of a grammar is made of a set of syntax diagrams. Each diagram defines a non-terminal. There is a main diagram which defines the language in the following way: to belong to the language, a word must describe a path in the main diagram. Each diagram has an entry point and an end point. The diagram describes possible paths between these two points by going through other nonterminals and terminals. Terminals are represented by round boxes while nonterminals are represented by rectangular boxes.  Example  We use arithmetic expressions as an example. First we provide a simplified BNF grammar: ::=  \\"+\\" ::=  \\"*\\" ::=   \\"(\\" \\")\\" ::= \\"x\\"  \\"y\\"  \\"z\\" ::=  ::= \\"0\\"  \\"1\\"  \\"2\\"  \\"3\\"  \\"4\\"  \\"5\\"  \\"6\\"  \\"7\\"  \\"8\\"  \\"9\\" This grammar can also be expressed in EBNF: expression = term , [ \\"+\\" , expression ]; term = factor , [ \\"*\\" , term ]; factor = constant  variable  \\"(\\" , expression , \\")\\"; variable = \\"x\\"  \\"y\\"  \\"z\\"; constant = digit , { digit }; digit = \\"0\\"  \\"1\\"  \\"2\\"  \\"3\\"  \\"4\\"  \\"5\\"  \\"6\\"  \\"7\\"  \\"8\\"  \\"9\\"; One possible set of syntax diagrams for either of these grammars is: Image:Example syntax diagram 3.svg See also * Recursive transition network * Extended Backus‚ÄìNaur form (EBNF) References Note: the first link is sometimes blocked by the server outside of its domain, but it is available on archive.org.

History The first known member of this family, Allahverdi Khan, was born to a Christian family in Georgia, but captured by the Persians during one of their raids, converted into Islam and trained for the ghulam army, a special military structure consisting of Christian captives. His raise to the governorship of Fars in 1595 marked the beginning of Shah Abbas I‚Äôs policy of replacing Turkic Qizilbash officers with the former ghulams. By 1600, Allahverdi-Khan made it into the most influential minister of the Safavid empire, being succeeded upon his death in 1613 by his older son, Imam-Quli Khan. Both father and son were responsible for the army reforms and major military exploits, including a series of successful campaigns that brought the Portuguese colonial gains in the Persian Gulf to an end. Allahverdi's younger son, Daud Khan, served as governor of Ganja and Karabakh from 1627 to 1633, and had more intimate ties with Georgia, the country of the family's origin. The Si-o-se Pol over the Zayandeh River constructed at the behest of Allahverdi Khan by the architect Mir Jamal al-Din Muhammad Jabiri. Shah Abbas I placed complete trust in the family and did not feel threatened by their wealth and power. With Abbas's death in 1629, the family's influence began to fade. The new shah, Safi, extremely suspicious of Abbas's favorites, resorted to bloody repressions, not without the advice and involvement of his new ministers, including the shah's mentor Khosrow Mirza (Rostam Khan), a Muslim Georgian prince of the Bagrationi dynasty. In late 1632, at Shah Safi's orders, Imam-Quli Khan, and his two sons amongst whom Safiqoli Khan, were killed, and his possessions added to the crown domain. This also formed the prelude to the massacre of the rest of his family. Things came to a head in 1633, after Daud Khan Undiladze, recently removed from his position in the majlis, defected to Georgia and joined his brother-in-law, Teimuraz I, in his rebellion against the Safavid hegemony. Daud Khan's sons were captured and castrated. Daud himself, being pressured by the Persian troops in Georgia, fled to the Ottoman Empire and disappeared from history. Though they were nearly completely eliminated after the purge, the succession of the Undiladze line amongst the court elites was assured by Ja'far Qoli, a grandson of Imam-Quli Khan by a daughter, who was given the post of beglarbegi (governor) of Astrabad in 1664 or 1666. The family has left a visible trace in Iranian culture. Their patronage of arts and education and zeal for building resulted in several notable examples of the Safavid architecture, especially in Shiraz and Esfahan. A statue to Imam-Quli Khan was installed on the island of Qeshm in the 2000s.  See also  * Iranian Georgians  Notes  References  * *Roger M. Savory, AllƒÅhverdƒ´ Khan.

It replaced the 1937 Pattern Web Equipment that had served the UK's Armed Forces through the Second World War and the first decade of the Cold War. It was in turn gradually replaced in the 1990s by the current issue '95 Pattern Personal Load Carrying Equipment (PLCE). Although replaced, the belt in particular seems to survive as an unofficial form of dress (replacing the general issue Working Belt) by older soldiers when worn with Combat Soldier 95 clothing.  Components  A general issue of 1958 Pattern webbing consisted of a belt, yoke, ammunition pouches (left, with provision for an SLR bayonet, and right, with a pouch to the rear for the ENERGA rifle grenade adapter), a water bottle pouch (also able to be fitted with a mug while containing the waterbottle), a pair of kidney pouches (for the storage of personal items - underwear and socks, washing and shaving kit, boot cleaning items, twenty-four-hour ration and any other items that the user may need to have secured), a poncho roll and a large pack. The standard webbing could be altered to take additional pieces of needed components, an example of which is the attachment of a sleeping bag or kip mat and blanket and torch. There were a number of ancillary pouches available for specialist tasks, e.g. pistol holster to hold the issue Browning Hi-Power, compass pouch. All components in the system are made from a sturdy and tight-woven canvas fabric in a dark olive green. The metal fittings are aluminium, anodised dark green. In its basic and standard configuration, each of the belt-mounted components is secured to the belt by a pair of double hooks (one double hook only in the case of the compass pouch) at the rear, hooked over the belt above and below, with the ends of the hooks further retained in canvas pockets on the inside face of the belt. However, variations are to be found - including water bottle pouches and ammunition pouches for non-standard personal weapons fitted with a canvas loop into which the belt is threaded, rather than the metal hooks. This method of attachment allows the pouch to be moved around the belt for the comfort of the user, for example when sitting for long periods. Several of the individual components evolved over the lifetime of the 1958 Pattern system. There were three iterations of the standard (SLR) ammunition pouches, and two of the water-bottle pouch, poncho roll and yoke.  Usage  The equipment was worn in a series of combinations. Weapon Training Order (or Skeleton Webbing) consisted of Belt, Yoke and Ammunition pouches. Combat Equipment Fighting Order (CEFO), was the term used for the full webbing system and once the Large Pack was attached, it became Combat Equipment Marching Order (CEMO). Over the course of its service, there were a number of developments and modifications. When the system was originally designed, little scope was given to Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) warfare and when this was addressed, the system gained a respirator haversack to house the then issue S6 NBC Respirator.  72 Pattern webbing  A proposal to replace the 58 pattern was the 72 pattern.http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx28/Whynotwebbing/Webbing%20kit/72webbing.jpg  Foreign copies and derivatives = 61 pattern webbing  * 61 pattern webbing, Rhodesian variant, also used by South Africa * 1970 pattern webbing, South African equivalent * Fireforce webbing, Rhodesian webbing UTV webbing * UTV webbing, East German equivalent made of nylon/rain camo  See also  * List of webbing equipment  References  Category:British Army equipment Category:Personal military carrying equipment ","title":"58 pattern webbing"},{"id":"13355523","text":"Waterman Creek is a U.S. Geological Survey.

The building is a combination of Queen Anne and Jacobean architectural styles, built of local brick with sandstone trim. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 as the Great Northern Depot. The Elk River-Milaca Line The Great Northern Railway originally did not travel through Princeton, it ran from Minneapolis through Elk River and on to St. Cloud. Another line ran from St. Cloud through Milaca to Duluth. Great Northern mogul James J. Hill challenged local business owners to raise $50,000 to route the line through Princeton. The money was raised, and the Elk River-Milaca line was slated to be built. Surveying for the route began in late March 1886, and the track- laying crew started building the new line from Elk River on October 24, 1886. With few obstacles to construction, the line was finished quickly, and rail service began on November 29, 1886. The new Princeton route actually shortened the distance between Minneapolis and Duluth. Initially service was frequent, but in November 1899 the route to Duluth was relocated to a line passing further east, connecting through Coon Rapids, Cambridge and Brook Park (known as the Coon Creek Cutoff or the Bee Line). As a result, service on the Elk River-Milaca line went into a long, drawn-out decline, with luxury passenger cars being replaced with ordinary coaches in 1908, the U.S. Mail route being lost in 1930, and passenger service terminated altogether in 1952. Freight service continued until 1976, at which time the Elk River-Milaca line was abandoned. The New Depot The Princeton depot was built in 1902 at a cost of $15,594, replacing a wooden-frame structure. The dedication ceremony was well-attended, with a crowd of at least 500 people. The size of the depot, at a length of 215 feet, a height of 35 feet, and a width exceeding 37 feet, made it the largest building in Princeton. The main products shipped from the depot were agricultural and forest commodities, along with a substantial amount of brick from a brickyard two miles north of Princeton. The Preservation Alliance of Minnesota listed this depot on its 2010 list of the 10 Most Endangered Historic Places in Minnesota. The building has since received a grant from the Minnesota Historical Society and is being restored. Mille Lacs County Historical Society Depot Museum The pioneer schoolhouse at the museum in 2015 Today, the depot is the home of the Mille Lacs County Historical Society Depot Museum, with railroad cars and track placed next to the building. Railroad cars on-site include a 1963 Milwaukee Road insulated boxcar, a 1925 Wooden Milwaukee Road boxcar, a 1963 Burlington Northern wide-vision steel caboose, and a 1963 Great Northern flat car used for concerts in the summer. Also on site is the 1856 \\"District 1\\" one-room schoolhouse, which was the first school in Mille Lacs County. Three Sisters The Princeton depot was one of three \\"sister\\" stations in the Great Northern system that had essentially the same design. One of her \\"sisters\\" was about 70 miles southwest of Princeton in Litchfield, Minnesota and the other one was about 1,700 miles to the west in Bellingham, Washington. Some of the materials and trim were different, but the design was almost identical. The other two \\"sisters\\" are long gone (the Bellingham depot burned in 1924, Litchfield razed their depot in 1985). The Princeton Great Northern depot is the sole survivor.

He was involved in Jacobite intrigues in the early 1730s. Early life Hyde was the only surviving son of Henry Hyde, 4th Earl of Clarendon and his wife Jane Leveson Gower, daughter of Sir William Leveson Gower, 4th Baronet, of Stittenham. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 21 May 1725, from which he received a DCL on 6 December 1728. He was an author of some talent, and both Swift and Pope praised his character. Career Cornbury involved himself in a Jacobite intrigue and went with James II's daughter, the Duchess of Buckingham, to Rome to meet the Pretender secretly in January 1731. He was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for Oxford University, at a by-election on 26 February 1732. Walpole's Excise Scheme of 1733 provoked great political unrest, and Cornbury thought the time right for a French-sponsored invasion by the Old Pretender. He was able to persuade the comte de Chavigny, the French ambassador to Britain, and Chauvelin, the French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to endorse an invasion of southern England, which, Cornbury claimed, would result in a Jacobite rising in the country and the overthrow of the Hanoverians. However, the scheme was quashed in the royal cabinet by Cardinal Fleury, and Chavigny, some of whose activities had come to the attention of the British government, was recalled. Thereafter, Cornbury avoided Jacobite politics and devoted himself to the cultivation of taste. Cornbury was returned unopposed at the 1734 British general election. He was active in his university's campaign against the mortmain bill of 1736, which would restrict the number of livings owned by charitable bodies and also restrict bequests of lands to them. In 1737 and 1738 he spoke against the army. At the 1741 British general election he was again returned unopposed for the University. In April 1742 he was offered a peerage, on Pulteney's recommendation, but refused it. He was absent at the division on the Hanoverian troops in November 1742, spoke for the Address in December 1743 and spoke for the Hanoverians in January 1744. He supported the loyal address on a threatened French invasion in February 1744. During the 1745 Jacobite rebellion, he voted against the government on the matter of recalling British troops from Flanders. He also opposed sending foreign troops to Scotland. In 1746, he voted against the Government on the Hanoverians . After being returned unopposed at the 1747 British general election he became disillusioned by the House of Commons, and took a year abroad for the sake of his health. He also sold property to pay his debts. In 1750, he applied to the King for a peerage and he was elevated to the House of Lords by a writ in acceleration in his father's title of Baron Hyde. He vacated his seat in the House of Commons. Death and legacy Cornbury died unmarried in Paris on 26 April 1753, predeceasing his father by six months; accounts differ on whether he died from a fall from a horse or by his own hand.

The squadron flew the Lockheed S-3B Viking and their mission was mining, undersea and surface warfare, electronic reconnaissance and analysis, over the horizon targeting, and aerial refueling. The squadron was last attached to Carrier Air Wing Seventeen (CVW-17) and was the last squadron flying the Viking. VS-22 was disestablished in a ceremony at NAS Jacksonville on January 29, 2009, and officially on March 31, 2009. History Two distinct squadrons have been designated VS-22. The second of these is the main subject of this article. Officially, the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage with disestablished squadrons if a new squadron is formed with the same designation.http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq6-1.htm Often, the new squadron will assume the nickname, insignia, and traditions of the earlier squadrons. First VS-22, 1945-1956 Six U.S. Navy Grumman TBM-3E Avenger anti-submarine aircraft of Composite Squadron VC-22 Checkmates flying over the Mediterranean Sea. Crash of a VS-22 Grumman AF Guardian from USS Block Island in 1953. The original VS-22 was established as torpedo squadron VT-42 on 19 June 1945 at NAS Brunswick, Maine (USA), also named \\"Checkmates\\". It was equipped with the Grumman TBM-3E/-3W/-3S Avenger. It was redesignated attack squadron VA-2E on 15 November 1946 at NAS Oceana, Virginia, and to composite squadron VC-22 on 15 September 1948. Finally the squadron became anti- submarine squadron VS-22 on 20 April 1950 at NAS Norfolk, Virginia. In the early 1950s the squadron transitioned to the Grumman AF-2S/-2W Guardian and was identified by the tail code \\"SL\\". The squadron served aboard the following carriers: , , , , , , , , , , , , , and the . The first VS-22 was disestablished at NAS Quonset Point on 1 June 1956. The majority of manpower, material and planes were reassigned to VS-27 at NAS Norfolk. Second VS-22, 1960-2009 A VS-22 S-2E approaching USS Essex in 1967 A new anti-submarine squadron VS-22 was established at NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island (USA), on 18 May 1960. From 1960 to 1976, the Checkmates flew the Grumman S-2 Tracker, better known as \\"Stoof\\" from its pre-1962 designation \\"S2F\\". VS-22 was assigned to Carrier Anti-Submarine Air Group 54 (CVSG-54) at NAS Quonset Point and operated from Essex-class anti-submarine carriers, mostly in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea: USS Lake Champlain, June 1960 - May 1965; USS Essex, June 1967 - August 1967; USS Wasp, March 1969 - November 1971; USS Intrepid, March 1972 (as part of CVSG-56). Besides the typical submarine hunting role for which the aircraft was designed, the Checkmates held a significant role in the United States space program. Naval aviator Alan B. Shepard's Freedom 7 spacecraft, the United States' first manned spacecraft, was tracked and located by VS-22 on 5 May 1961. In August 1965, while embarked on USS Lake Champlain, VS-22 recovered Gemini 5 astronauts Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad. Finally, VS-22 was engaged in the recovery of Apollo 7 astronauts while deployed aboard USS Essex. 1970s-80s Jet transitions started in the summer of 1974 with pilots training in Rockwell T-2C Buckeyes and Douglas TA-4J Skyhawks at NAS Meridian, Mississippi, making VS-22 the first east coast based S-3A squadron. With the retirement of the anti-submarine carriers the anti-submarine squadrons were integrated into the former attack carrier air wings. From 1976 to 2001 VS-22 was assigned to Carrier Air Wing Three (CVW-3). Between 1976 and 1980 VS-22 made four deployments aboard the USS Saratoga. After the Saratoga went to drydock in September 1980, CVW-3 transitioned to deployments aboard the USS John F. Kennedy CV-67. The squadron transitioned to the S-3B in 1989. 1990s This was followed by seven cruises aboard USS John F. Kennedy, including participation in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm in 1990/91. Operation \\"Desert Storm\\" commenced on 17 January 1991. VS-22 aircrews flew over 1100 combat hours and 324 combat sorties in direct support of the coalition forces. Target information gleaned by VS-22 aircraft played a major role in the suppression of enemy air defences during the first days of Desert Storm. From 22 January 1991 until the cease- fire on 28 February 1991, the Checkmates flew in every CVW-3 strike against Iraq . VS-22 was also employed in support of CJTF-4 counter narcotics operations during the last part of 1991 through the first part of 1992 earned the Checkmates the \\"Joint Meritorious Unit Award\\" for locating over 1500 contacts, confirming 50 as suspected offenders. After a long pre-deployment work-up schedule, VS-22 embarked on the carrier USS John F. Kennedy in October 1992. Concentrating on multi-national Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea exercises during the first half of deployment, VS-22 provided initial in-flight refueling training for Egyptian Air Force Mirage 2000 pilots and practiced ASW skills while leading over 40 multi-national, integrated and air wing exercise strikes against NATO ships. Later VS-22 participated in Operations Provide Comfort and Provide Promise, providing radar locating and command and control information. In February 1994, VS-22 joined CVW-3 and USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was at this time that United States Congress passed laws permitting the embarkation of women in combat units. VS-22 had the distinction of being the first S-3B command to be assigned female sailors. On 16 April 1995, VS-22 returned from their Mediterranean deployment on board Dwight D. Eisenhower. On 26 November 1996, VS-22 deployed on board USS Theodore Roosevelt to the Mediterranean and the North Persian Gulf. VS-22 participated in operations \\"Southern Watch\\" and \\"Decisive Endeavor\\" as well as numerous other joint exercises. On 21 April 1997, in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Checkmates became the first S-3B squadron to launch the AGM-65F Infrared Maverick missile. VS-22 next deployed on board USS Enterprise. VS-22 participated in various exercises such as Operation Desert Fox, Juniper Stallion and Noble Anvil, mostly providing electronic warfare support. VS-22's S-3B, callsign \\"Vidar 700\\", deployed to Al Asad, Iraq A S-3B from VS-22 at Eielson Air Force Base during Exercise Red Flag - Alaska, July 2007. 2000s In November 2000 VS-22 and CVW-3 embarked on USS Harry S. Trumans maiden deployment. On 16 February 2001, CVW-3 participated in strikes against Iraq as a part of Operation Southern Watch. The Checkmates deployed for a second time with the Truman in December 2002, this time participating in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, launching missions from the Eastern Mediterranean. October 2004 saw VS-22 deploying with CVW-3 and Harry S. Truman for the last time. VS-22 flew 1170 sorties and 3220 hours in support of \\"Operation Iraqi Freedom\\", patrolling the oil infrastructure in the Persian Gulf during \\"Operation Sea Dragon II\\" missions. VS-22 deployed in 2006 on USS George Washington, being assigned to CVW-17. VS-22 last carrier embark was from 7 April to 27 May 2008, aboard George Washington for the transit from Norfolk around South America to San Diego, California. Less than a week after returning from GW, VS-22 was ordered to deploy to Iraq as a land based squadron.

The brand launched on Saturday 20 October 2007 on BBC Two and ceased broadcasting on 18 December 2010. It included a block of television programmes on BBC Two, an online portal, and programming on the BBC's youth radio station, BBC Radio 1. It was BBC Two's second programming block aimed at teenagers, following on from DEF II. Content= Television  Four programmes were originally shown as part of BBC Switch on Saturday afternoons on BBC Two. Sound was a weekly music entertainment and chat show presented by Annie Mac and Nick Grimshaw. Falcon Beach was an imported Canadian coming-of-age drama about teenagers, their passions, relationships, friends, families and enemies. Them was a documentary series that explored the different teenage tribes that exist in Britain today. The Surgery presented by Jeff Leach was a chat show for BBC Switch, which effectively replaced The Sunday Surgery presented by Kelly Osbourne, aimed to help teenagers with everyday problems. On 17 May 2008, three new shows were launched under the BBC Switch brand: Kyle XY, a sci-fi drama, Class of 2008, a documentary series which followed six friends in London, and Revealed..., a new journalism show which looked at the lives of teens in the UK, presented by Charlotte Ashton and Anthony Baxter. The ABC Family show Greek was also shown. Since 2008, continuity links for BBC Switch on BBC Two were presented by Tom Deacon and AJ Odudu either at an outdoor location in various parts of the UK or indoors in The 5:19 Show studio. Previously it was presented by 'Flash Louis'. The 5:19 Show also had a slot on Saturday afternoons, a show that was focussed around a celebrity interview with a game that often used a pun on the celebrity name. This was also presented by Tom Deacon and AJ Odudu. (The 5:19 Show is also used for the interstitials.) Tom Deacon also hosted a 5:19 Show as part of the Sunday night Switch broadcast on Radio 1.  Radio  BBC Radio 1 devoted Sunday evenings to BBC Switch from 7pm. The 5:19 show started at 7pm and finished at 9pm when The Surgery with Aled started, and then at 10pm, Annie and Nick, who previously aired from 7 to 10pm, aired until midnight. \\"Switch\\" was unique in the fact that younger viewers' contributions were also aired. Some were even involved in pre- and post-production roles. BBC Radio Switch the digital sister station of BBC Radio 1 launched in 2008.  Online  BBC Switch online was a website portal linking teens to content across the BBC including BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 1Xtra, BBC Blast and EastEnders. The Switch brand also included Slink, an online magazine for teenage girls. Annie Mac said: \\"I'm really honoured and excited to be involved with BBC Switch on Sunday nights. The show is going to be like nothing heard on radio before. It's a proper challenge for me and something I can't wait to get stuck in to.\\" \\"As for Sound, I'm really looking forward to working with Grimmy [Nick Grimshaw] and the opportunity to showcase new and upcoming bands on TV is truly exciting for me, it's so important that music gets this kind of TV exposure.\\" The 5:19 Show was also part of BBC Switch. It was hosted by Tom Deacon, AJ Odudu, and Jimmy Hill online from Monday to Friday at 5:19pm.BBC Switch 5:19 show The show was named 5:19 in recognition of the time most teenagers log-on.Guardian - BBC Teen content initiative  Live events  The first BBC Switch Live was held on 12 October 2008 at the Hammersmith Apollo. It featured performances by Fall Out Boy, Ne-Yo, Miley Cyrus, McFly, Basshunter and N-Dubz, with a special guest performance by George Sampson. The event, hosted by Annie Mac, Nick Grimshaw, Kelly Osbourne and Tom Deacon, was strictly for 14- to 17-year-olds. The second event was held on 8 November 2009, at the same venue. Aled Haydn Jones, Kimberly Walsh, Annie Mac and Nick Grimshaw hosted, with many acts playing, including The Saturdays, JLS, N-Dubz, The Black Eyed Peas, Shaheen Jafargholi, Alexandra Burke and Pixie Lott. Many of the performances were made available for viewing on the BBC Switch website. The awards were designed and produced by UK trophy manufacturer Gaudio Awards.  Closure  Director general Mark Thompson's strategic review of the corporation's scope and activities included proposals to close BBC Switch and BBC Blast, which are aimed at teenagers. In February 2010, The Guardian and The Times newspapers both reported that the BBC Switch website was under threat of closure, in a review of the BBC's online presence. In July 2010, BBC Trust published an interim announcement which confirmed that it would support Mark Thompson's proposal to close BBC Blast! and BBC Switch, effectively signalling the closure of BBC Blast and BBC Switch but confirmed that BBC Radio Switch as well as their involvement with BBC Radio 1 would continue under the management of BBC Radio. In December 2010, Andy Parfitt confirmed he will remain in control of BBC Radio Switch. The following day, BBC Switch finally ended after three years. It was announced that the closure of BBC Switch was due to a 25% cut in the BBC Online budget, reducing it by ¬£34 million. All possibility that the site would return was removed upon this announcement in January 2011.

It is also known as the cradle of drupad. It is one of the four singing gharanas of Punjab; the other three are: Patiala, Talwandi and Kapurthala. It is most notably represented in modern times by the brothers Nazakat and Salamat Ali Khan. History The gharana is believed to have been founded in the 16th century by Chand Khan and Suraj Khan who were contemporaries of Tansen at the court of Mughal emperor Akbar. Successive generations of musicians in the gharana specialised in the dhrupad form of singing and evolved a tradition of duet vocal (jugalbandi) performances. Meer Baksh and Khairdeen, Karam Elahi Khan, Vilayat Ali and Hadayat Khan, Ghulam Shabir Khan and Ghulam Jafar Khan, Nazakat Ali and Salamat Ali are noted practitioners of jugalbandi from this gharana. The gharana is centred at a village of the same name in the Hoshiarpur district of Punjab (India); alternate spellings include Shamchurasi. Another explanation of the name is that sham is taken from the name of the Sufi saint, Sant Shami Shah and (chaurasi =84) was named after a cluster of 84 villages which constituted a land revenue unit. , Retrieved 7 November 2018 in the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. According to one legend, the founders were given a parcel of land here as a grant to them by Mughal Emperor Akbar. In an alternative version of the origin, the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah \\"Rangila\\" was said to have been so impressed by the gharana that he gave all income from the 84 local villages, known as 'Chaurasi', to the Sufi saint Sant Shami Shah.Tradition of Hindustani Music By Manorma Sharma p62 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YdtqrooCo-oC&pg;=PA63 Retrieved 7 November 2018 Nazakat and Salamat Ali Khan Around the turn of the century, the gharana was represented by Vilayat Ali Khan, who was noted for his dhrupad singing. His sons were Salamat Ali Khan, Nazakat Ali Khan, Tasadaq Ali Khan, Akhter Ali Khan and Zakir Ali Khan. The brothers Nazakat Ali Khan (1928-1984) and Salamat Ali Khan (1934-2001) had their debut performance on All India Radio, Delhi in 1942, when Salamat was only 8. They went to Amritsar for a memorable concert: :\\"When the performance started, it seemed like a feast of musical notes had descended upon us in the audience. Every member of the audience was amazed and in complete awe of the duo. It was almost unbelievable that boys of that age could give such a fine performance. When the drut portion started, the brothers gave a blazing display of taans, sargams and layakari, which left the audience stunned\\".: After the 1947 Partition of British India, the family first moved to Multan, Pakistan and later moved to Lahore, Pakistan. They emerged as one of the leading performers of classical music in Pakistan.

The name of the dance comes from the native Xitsonga language and it can translate to \\"hitting to the rhythm\\", for example, the concept \\"xi Bela ni vunanga\\". The name \\"xibelani\\" typically refers to the dance style while the skirt itself is referred to as \\"tinguvu\\", however, the term \\"xibelani\\" is sometimes used to refer to both the dance and the skirt. History The history of the xibelani dance goes way back into the early coastal times of southern Mozambique from the 1400s or earlier when Mozambican tribes were experimenting with musical instruments and particularly wooden instruments and percussion sounds from traditional drums, xylophones, and marimbas.Tracey, Hugh (1970). Chopi Musicians: Their Music, Poetry, and Instruments. 1st ed., reprinted, with a new introduction. London and New York: Oxford University Press. First published in 1948. . The indigenous Chopi people became particularly active in this art and are the documented source concerning the early times of this form of music and dance, the timbila which has been registered in the UNESCO heritage archives as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.UNESCO, 2014, ‚ÄúChopi Timbila‚Äù accessed 31 October 2017. The dance style, in essence, requires the dancer to shake the hips in tune with the rhythm but the whole body should be used to guide the movements. Xibelani dancers usually accompanied the percussion music in addition to hand clapping and whistles. When the mbila (xylophone) and swigubu (drum) players engaged in an orchestra, the Tsonga women would follow up with the singing, which was in the form of a call-and-response method, and at intervals the women would take turns to dance in front of the orchestra.Junod, Henri (1927), Life of a South African Tribe: The Social Life, London: Macmillan & Co. The xibelani skirts of old were made with various fibers, wool, strings, and grass. The modern xibelani are often long dresses made with strong cloth which gives the name tinguvu. Method In the xibelani dance, the Tsonga women tie a type of African skirt‚Äîthe xibelani commonly known as \\"tinguvu\\"‚Äîaround their waist and then shake from the waist. The xibelani skirt is designed to make the wearer's hips look bigger, and thereby to emphasize the shaking. The skirt itself is made from cloth or wool and is customized with a range of colors and designs. The cloth or wool is woven either by hand or by machine and designed in the manner that it resembles a type of Caribbean skirt. Modern-day xibelani skirts are usually designed for dancing and therefore have a swirl when the hips are shaken. The methodology of its dance style is the typical Caribbean shake, although with a faster rhythm and a more complicated dance routine that is customary for the Tsonga people. Uses It is customary for Tsonga girls to learn the xibelani dance, and it is a way for them to express pride in their cultural heritage. The xibelani dance is used on occasions such as mkhinyavezo and Ku chachula,as well as to accompany other traditional dances such as the makhwaya and mchongolo. Traditionally women dance the xibelani, while men perform the makhwaya, Xincayinciy(xigubu) and on rare occasions participate in the mchongolo. The Tsongas perform the xibelani dance to their own distinct music, usually Tsonga disco or Tsonga ndzhumbha (Xitsonga traditional music) and it has become typical for all Tsonga bands to have female xibelani dancers. The xibelani and tshetsha dances have experienced regained popularity in modern Giyani as the people have embraced their traditional ways. While the xibelani dance is customary for women, some men now also participate in it, especially when there is a xiseveseve (a type of party). In modern society the xibelani dance is regarded as an open dance in which everyone can participate, and it is also used both in church as well as in rituals.

As a single comms system operating with standardised equipment across all 57 fire and rescue services across Great Britain, the system will also enhance the services' ability to respond collectively to major incidents by allowing fire and rescue appliances supporting major incidents the ability to speak directly to the control room managing the incident (where ever it may be). Finally, the system is also more resilient and secure and offers inter-interoperability with other blue lights services.

Firelink: improved fire and rescue service radio communications (accessed 20 Sep 07) It is a private, digital, secure, Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) network, and will replace the many different existing networks commissioned by individual fire and rescue services. In England, the project is part of CLG's fire resilience programme, which also includes the New Dimension programme and FiReControl projects. The New Dimension project has already delivered a range of equipment to the FRS to assist with handling large-scale incidents. The vehicles supplied as part of the New Dimension provision were fitted with the new Firelink digital radios.

Other rugby league titles published by League Publications Ltd include the weekly newspaper Rugby Leaguer & League Express and the annual Gillette Rugby League Yearbook. History Rugby League World began life in May 1976 as Open Rugby, founded by Harry Edgar, who published and edited the title until July 1998 when it was sold to League Publications Ltd. Graham Clay then took over as editor, and oversaw the change of title to Rugby League World in March 1999. A short-lived Australian edition was launched and ran for 7 issues, between March to September 2002. In 2011 an Apple iPad and Android edition of the magazine was launched. Although the magazine is aimed at the British market, its important coverage of French rugby league give to Rugby League World a paradoxal position: in 2018, it is the sole monthly paper magazine in Northern Hemisphere which covers regularly events and competitions organised on the French territory.

Quintessence was formed by Pickwick International Inc. as a budget label. Pickwick‚Äôs trademark for Quintessence was filed on December 10, 1976 with the initial Q made to look like a clef symbol. The label was devoted to the licensed reissue of historic classical recordings. The idea was printed on the record jackets: \\"Critically acclaimed recordings of the basic repertoire which belong in every library of great music\\" and also promised these were \\"Carefully remastered from the original master tapes, recut on the latest Neumann lathes and pressed on virgin vinyl.\\" R. Peter Munves was the executive responsible for the label. Munves had earlier worked for Columbia Records and RCA Records classical music divisions. He said to Time magazine in 1971 ‚ÄúYou can call me the P.T. Barnum of the classics‚Äù. Many of the Quintessence records were originally included in Reader's Digest boxed sets produced by Decca Records for RCA Victor. The producer of many of these sets was Charles Gerhardt and the engineer Kenneth Wilkinson. Conductors such as John Barbirolli and Jascha Horenstein and pianist Earl Wild were featured in these reissues. Series issued included: *‚ÄúCritics Choice‚Äù (beginning with PMC 7001) *‚ÄúClassics for Joy‚Äù (beginning possibly with PMC 7010) *‚ÄúStereo Sound Spectaculars‚Äù (beginning with vol. 1 on PMC 7063) Quintessence also licensed and reissued recordings from CBS Records, EMI, Harmonia Mundi, Melodiya, Deutsche Grammophon, RCA, and Supraphon. Some of the material was original monaural but replaced by ‚Äúelectronic stereo‚Äù versions. Many of the record jackets included discographical details such as dates, locales, producers and engineers. The records listed for $3.98 in the 1970s but can be found in the second hand market for two dollars or less. Quintessence released both monaural and stereophonic discs in the 33-1/3 rpm LP format. LPs were issued in the PMC 7000 series (the P standing for Pickwick) beginning with PMC 7001: Dvorak Symphony No. 9 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Jascha Horenstein (recorded by Decca for Reader's Digest at Walthamstow Assembly Hall in January 1962). Multiple LP sets were issued in the #PC-3000 series, the # standing for the number of discs. Some of these same recordings were later reissued on CD by Intersound, Inc.

As with The Rifleman, this series was produced by Four Star Productions in association with Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c4-DkNVxoY Law of the Plainsman is distinctive in that it was one of the few television programs that featured a Native American as the lead character, a bold move for U.S.network television at that time. Ansara had earlier appeared in the series Broken Arrow, having portrayed the Apache chief, Cochise. Ansara, however, was not Native American but of Syrian descent. Plot Ansara played Sam Buckhart, an Apache Indian who saved the life of a U.S. Cavalry officer after an Indian ambush. When the officer died, he left Sam money that was used for an education at private schools and Harvard University. After school, he returned to New Mexico where he became a Deputy Marshal working for Marshal Andy Morrison. He lived in a boarding house run by Martha Commager. Other continuing characters include 8-year old Tess Logan, an orphan who had been rescued by Buckhart, and a second Deputy Marshal, Billy Lordan.

The film was directed by the photographer duo of Krupakar- Senani and mainly filmed in the Bandipur National Park and the Mudumalai National Park of India. Premise The film centres around a pack of dholes, canids native to Central and Southeast Asia. The dhole is a highly social animal, living in large clans without rigid dominance hierarchies.Fox, M. W. (1984), The Whistling Hunters: Field Studies of the Indian Wild Dog (Cuon Alpinus), Steven Simpson Books, p. 85, Such clans usually consist of 12 individuals, but groups of over 40 are known.Cohen, J. A. (1978), Cuon alpinus . Mammalian Species 100: 1-3.

Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK. x + pp. 210-219 It is listed as Endangered by the IUCN, on account of its decreasing population, which is now estimated at less than 2,500 adults. Factors contributing to this decline include habitat loss, loss of prey, competition with other species, persecution, and disease transfer from domestic dogs. Database entry includes justification for why this species is endangered Production The film was produced for the National Geographic Channel and completed in the year 2006. It was shot over a period of 12 years . The shooting of the film was a difficult task because of the elusive nature of the dhole and the forest terrain. While shooting for this film, Krupakar-Senani were kidnapped and held captive by the forest brigand, Veerappan. Story line The film uncovers the life of Krupakar, a film maker who wants to make a film on dhole, but is abandoning the venture because of its elusive behaviour. He encounters a local tribesman, who gives insights on how to track the animal. The pack hunts together and various instances where they co- ordinate to kill a prey is shown. The meat that the adult dogs eat is regurgitated and the bones separated which is offered to the smaller pups as their meal. The film also shows how the adults protect the pups. Two female dogs which have strayed from another pack try to join this pack. The female leader of the pack, sensing that she might lose out on the male dogs in her pack, tries to prevent them from joining the pack. But the newcomers manage to lure away some males from the pack and start their own.

Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan (1849‚Äì1919) was the founder of this gharana. History The gharana find its origins in Ustad Mehboob Khan, the chief khayal singer in the royal court of Rampur State (in present Uttar Pradesh), his tradition was followed by his son Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan (1849‚Äì1919) and in turn by Inyat's brothers-in-law, Ustad Haider Khan (1857‚Äì1927),Ustad Fida Hussain Khan and Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan (1878‚Äì1964) (The First recipient of the Padma Bhushan Award) ( , thus all the singers were connected with each other, and gharana was named after their ancestral place, Sahaswan, in present Badaun district.Wade. p. 136 Amongst most famous and relevant vocalists of the Gharana are Padmabhushan Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan, Padmavibhushan Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan and Padmashri Ustad Rashid Khan Ustad Inayat Khan was a child prodigy, and his first married the daughter of Haddu Khan of the Gwalior gharana. Singing style The Rampur-Sahaswan gayaki (style of singing) is closely related to the Gwalior Gharana, which features medium-slow tempos, a full-throated voice and intricate rhythmic play. The gharana style is also known for the diversity and intricacy of the taans (rapidfire elaborations), as well as tarana singing. The renowned singers of this gharana include the first and, perhaps the foremost disciple of Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan, Ustad Hyder Khan sahab. In fact, Ustad Hyder Khan and his family plays a vital role in upbringing the legacy of this illustrious family as, not only him but, after his demise, his son Ustad Fida Hussain Khan and his grandson, the renowned maestro Padma Bhushan Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan made sure that the legacy carries forward to the next generation. Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan was not just a singer but a great teacher who has given the gharana what it has in the modern Ustad Nissan Hussain Khans disciples are great Vocalists Padma Vibhushan Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan, Padma Shri Ustad Rashid Khan Padma Shri Ustad Hafeez Ahmed Khan, Ustad Sarfaraz Hussain Khan etc.,another legendary singer of this gharana is Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan, who was a disciple of Ustad Hyder Khan and later on, groomed by Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan sahab. He was the recipient of the first Padma Bhushan award in singing. Currently, the gharana is represented by 2 major families, all inter related to each other. This consists of the direct blood of Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan sahab and his other relatives and disciples.

The concept was introduced by David Heinemeier Hansson to describe the philosophy of the Ruby on Rails web framework, but is related to earlier ideas like the concept of \\"sensible defaults\\" and the principle of least astonishment in user interface design. The phrase essentially means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class Sales in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called \\"sales\\" by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as the table \\"product sales\\", that one needs to write code regarding these names. When the convention implemented by the tool matches the desired behavior, it behaves as expected without having to write configuration files. Only when the desired behavior deviates from the implemented convention is explicit configuration required. Ruby on Rails' use of the phrase is particularly focused on its default project file and directory structure, which prevent developers from having to write XML configuration files to specify which modules the framework should load, which was common in many earlier frameworks. Disadvantages of the convention over configuration approach can occur due to conflicts with other software design principles, like the Zen of Python's \\"explicit is better than implicit.\\" A software framework based on convention over configuration often involves a domain-specific language with a limited set of constructs or an inversion of control in which the developer can only affect behavior using a limited set of hooks, both of which can make implementing behaviors not easily expressed by the provided conventions more difficult than when using a software library that does not try to decrease the number of decisions developers have to make or require inversion of control. Other methods of decreasing the number of decisions a developer needs to make include programming idioms and configuration libraries with a multilayered architecture. Motivation Some frameworks need multiple configuration files, each with many settings. These provide information specific to each project, ranging from URLs to mappings between classes and database tables. Many configuration files with many parameters are often difficult to maintain. For example, early versions of the Java persistence mapper Hibernate mapped entities and their fields to the database by describing these relationships in XML files. Most of this information could have been revealed by conventionally mapping class names to the identically named database tables and the fields to their columns, respectively. Later versions did away with the XML configuration file and instead employed these very conventions, deviations from which can be indicated through the use of Java annotations (see JavaBeans specification, linked below). Usage Maven software tool auto-generated this directory structure for a Java project. Many modern frameworks use a convention over configuration approach. The concept is older, however, dating back to the concept of a default, and can be spotted more recently in the roots of Java libraries. For example, the JavaBeans specification relies on it heavily. To quote the JavaBeans specification 1.01:Sun (24 July 1997).

The bridge is a variant of the Mabey Compact 200 bridge, with alterations made to suit the military user as well as a ramp system to provide ground clearance to civilian and military vehicles.  Description  US Army Mabey Logistic Support Bridge Iraq The Logistic Support Bridge is a non-assault bridge for the movement of supplies and the re-opening of communications. It is a low-cost system that can be used widely throughout the support area, as well as for a range of defined applications. All types of vehicles including civilian vehicles with low ground clearances are accommodated. The Mabey Logistic Support Bridge originated from the Bailey bridge concept. Compared with World War II material in use throughout the world, LSB is manufactured with chosen modern steel grades, with a strong steel deck system. With strong deep transoms, there are only two per bay instead of the four previously needed on Bailey bridges. Beyond the need for the re-opening of communications, Logistic Support Bridge- based equipment (Compact 200) can be used as a rescue bridge for relief in natural disaster situations or as a civilian bridge for semi-permanent bridging to open up communications in some of the most remote regions of the world.  Users  98m bridge built by the Romanian Engineer Battalion. The bridge was completed on 6 July 1996. Construction time 6 days Loading MLC60. Bridge built by US and Hungarian Engineers. Completed 22 March 1996. Construction time 4 days, MLC60. The bridge is manufactured by Mabey Group at its Mabey Bridge factory in Lydney, Gloucestershire (Mabey Group's original factory, now closed, was in Chepstow and manufactured large bridge girders; in May 2019, the Group sold Mabey Bridge to the US-based Acrow Bridge). The name LSB was given by the British Army (Royal Engineers) to supply bridging to satisfy their specific requirements for a logistic or line of communication bridging. The LSB went into service with the British Army on 21 December 2001. The system is proved and approved by a number of NATO forces. Armies from a number of countries around the world own equipment or have trained and deployed on the system, notably during the crisis in the Balkans. These Armies include Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Nepal, Netherlands, Romania, Sri Lanka, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Turkey, Venezuela, United Kingdom, United States. The bridge has been built in many locations across Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. Naval Mobile Construction Battalions (Seabees) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. During the Canadian OPERATION ATHENA, members of 1 CER on Task Force 3-09 constructed a Mabey Logistic Support Bridge over a pre-existing bridge after a vehicle borne suicide bomb detonated on the bridge close to Kandahar Airfield The Swedish Transport Administration also uses the bridge where it is used during road renovation and construction or as a stop gap after road damage.http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/aktuellt/2017/09/varselgult-och-gront- samarbete-i-orsundsbro/ Features *The bridge takes military load class 80 Tracked, 110 Wheeled *The bridge can span up to 61m *LSB has a lane width of 4.2m *Multi-span equipment enables the bridge to be built to any length on fixed or floating supports *Built on a greenfield site using grillages, ground beams and ramps *The bridge is normally built using an atc244 22 ton capacity crane or a hydraulic excavator using a bucket with a lifting eye. System description Intermediate span being floated into position on intermediate piers Anchor systems with hand winches Landing Spans launched from the home and far banks Completed float bridge The LSB combines standard off the shelf equipment with a range of purpose designed special equipment to meet the expectations of modern military loads and traffic expectations. *Panels --These are the main structural components of the bridge trusses. They are welded items comprising top and bottom chords interconnected by vertical and diagonal bracing. At the end of each panel, chords terminate in male lugs or eyes and at the other end in female lugs or eyes. This allows panels to be pinned together to form the bridge span. There are two different panels; a Super Panel and a High Shear Super Panel. The High Shear Super Panel is used at each end of the bridge span depending upon the loading criteria. *Chord reinforcement --These are constructed in the same way as the chords of the bridge panels and are bolted to the panels to increase the bending capacity of the bridge. For the LSB a heavy chord reinforcement is used. *Transoms --These are fabricated from universal beams and form the cross girders of the bridge, spanning between the panels and carrying the bridge deck. The transom is designed for the appropriate loading criteria and for LSB is designed to accommodate MLC80T/110W. *Decks --Unlike wooden Bailey decks, the steel LSB decks are 1.05m x 3.05m and are manufactured using robotic welding technology. The decks are manufactured to have a long fatigue life and with durbar/checkered plate finish. The decks withstand both wheeled and tracked vehicles. *Bracing --A variety of bracing members are used to connect panels to form the bridge trusses and to brace adjacent transoms to the bridge. *Grillages and Ground Beams --On greenfield sites and when being used as an over bridge, ground beams are available that form an assembly which transmits all dead and live forces from the bridge into the ground. For a 40m (MLC80T/110W) bridge the ground bearing pressure is 200 kN/m2. The grillages are located on the top of the ground beams and accommodate the bridge bearings as well as the head of the ramp transom. *Ramps --The slope or profile of the ramps can be adjusted to allow for the passage of a range of civilian and military traffic. The length of a standard ramp at each end of the bridge is 13.5m. The ramps are bolted to the grillages and use standard deck units supported on special transoms. These transoms can be positioned at a variety of heights depending upon the set adopted with a special ramp post. The interface between the ramp and ground is a special toe ramp unit (1.5m) Construction The bridge can be constructed by the cantilever launch method without the need for any temporary intermediate support. This is achieved by erecting a temporary launching nose at the front of the bridge and pushing the bridge over the gap on rollers. After pushing the bridge over the gap, the launching nose is dismantled and the bridge is jacked down onto its bearings. The launching nose is largely constructed from standard bridge components. Floating variants There are a number of floating versions of the Mabey LSB in use across Iraq: Floating Piers which consist of steel Flexifloat pontoon units, Landing Piers consisting of 16 pontoon units, and Intermediate Piers which consist of 8 pontoons each. Hand winches are mounted on steel trays which are bolted to the pontoons. The anchors are connected to the hand winches and pontoons via steel chain and polypropylene ropes. Special span junction decks allow for the rotation of the floating spans as the spans deflect under live load. If the bridge is relatively short in terms of the number of spans, it may be possible to launch the complete bridge from one bank. On a long span bridge, launching intermediate spans and floating them into position on intermediate piers is more practical.

A prestigious figure in the Berlin cultural scene during the 1930s, Trapp, amongst others in the Nazi influenced scene, was regularly invited to contribute to concert programs and competitions. Trapp was born in Berlin and attended the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik (now the Berlin University of the Arts) where he studied under Paul Juon and Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi. After the completion of his studies, he did not have regular employment and worked as an itinerant pianist. In 1920, however, he obtained a post as lecturer at the Berlin conservatoire, becoming a professor there in 1926. His best-known pupils include Josef Tal, Sabur≈ç Moroi and G√ºnter Raphael. Between 1926 and 1930, Trapp offered a master class in composition at the music conservatoire in Dortmund. In 1932 he joined the NSDAP.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 617. In June 1933, Trapp joined the Nazi movement through an \\"Appeal to the Creative\\" (Appell an die Schaffenden). In 1934, he stepped down from the Berlin conservatoire and became the director of a masterclass in composition at the Berlin Academy of Arts (since merged with the University of the Arts). Here from 1936-9 he taught Sophie Carmen Eckhardt-Gramatt√©. In 1940, Trapp received the national composition prize. From 1950 to 1953, he was a teacher at Berlin's St√§dtischen Konservatorium.\\"Mitgliederdatenbank der Akademie der K√ºnste\\" He died at the age of 83 in Berlin.  Works  Heavily influenced by Richard Strauss and Max Reger, Trapp composed orchestral, chamber and piano works, including seven symphonies,Grove 6 article by William D. Gudger.

The term originated in the mid-19th century, when the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and British pound began to be transmitted across the Atlantic by a submarine communications cable.

The existing local authorities varied widely in population and size: the six county councils or county boroughs in the metropolitan area had similar responsibilities, but the number of inhabitants in their areas under their control varied from over 3,000,000 to 110,000. There were 102 county districts within the review area and these also varied greatly: some had larger populations and rateable value than existing county boroughs, while others had only a few thousand residents. Outside of the County of London, the division of functions between county councils and county districts was also unclear: some districts enjoyed considerable independence with a range of delegated ‚Äúcounty‚Äù powers while similar districts did not. There were no set criteria for such delegation, which instead came about because of \\"fortuitous historical, political and personal factors\\", which led to \\"serious administrative friction\\" in some counties.Marjorie McIntosh, The Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London, in The British Journal of Sociology, Vol. 12, No. 3. (Sep., 1961), pp. 236-248. Work The Commission held 114 meetings, heard oral evidence on 70 occasions and asked nearly 16,000 questions.E. W. Gilbert, Review of Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London, 1957-60, (Cmnd. 1164), in The Geographical Journal, Vol. 127, No. 3. (Sep., 1961), pp. 350-351. The Commission was also able to draw on the work of the Greater London Group of the London School of Economics, which had carried out an extensive survey on local government in London. The evidence heard by the Commission was contradictory: the Ministry of Local Government and Housing depicted a system that was breaking down, but the local authorities vigorously defended the status quo. In the absence of consensus, the Commission drew up two criteria by which to guide its recommendations: *Efficiency and economy in the use of human and financial resources *Maintenance of healthy local democracy By following these criteria a two-tier system was envisaged, with a regional authority for \\"technical\\" services and smaller local authorities for \\"personal\\" services. Many of the deliberations involved trying to find an optimum size for the sub-units of the proposed system. The general agreement of witnesses was that a basic \\"many-purpose\\" unit should have a population of between at least 250,000, many favouring a range of 500,000 to 1,500,000. It was stressed by council officers and teachers that authorities would need to be of a sufficiently large size to provide promotion prospects and attract good staff. The Commission, however, favoured smaller units because of the second criterion: large authorities, it was felt, would be remote from their citizens. It also hoped that smaller local authorities would encourage greater participation in local elections. The Commission displayed a dislike of \\"bigness\\", in particular describing the London County Council as \\"massive\\", \\"inhuman\\" and \\"monolithic\\". Three criteria were used by the commission to consider if places on the periphery should be included in the review area. They were extent to which a locality was independent and freestanding the closeness of links with the capital and the outlook of the district towards or away from London. In 1960 the commission deleted Potters Bar and all parts of Hertfordshire aside from Cheshunt, Barnet and East Barnet from the review area.Young, K. & Garside, P., Metropolitan London: Politics and Urban Change 1837-1981, (1982) Report The Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London, 1957‚Äì60, (Cmnd. 1164) was published on 19 October 1960. The recommendations in the unanimous report were: *The establishment of a Regional Council for Greater London. The council was to be entirely elected, with one member for each parliamentary constituency. *The Regional council was to administer \\"strategic services\\" such as town planning, traffic management, education, fire and ambulance services. *A second tier of local units, called \\"Greater London Boroughs\\", would be formed by amalgamation of the existing metropolitan boroughs, county boroughs, municipal boroughs and county districts. *Greater London Boroughs were to have a population of between 100,000 and 250,000. *Some services would need to be shared between the two tiers. For example, the regional authority would decide on the educational budget, maintenance of standards, planning of location and types of schools and the recruitment of teachers; the boroughs would oversee the day-to-day administration of all schools in their area. The Commission did not include the entire review area within its proposed Greater London region: they excluded Aldenham, Bushey, Chorleywood, Dartford, Elstree, Northaw, Potters Bar, Rickmansworth, Waltham Holy Cross, Watford and Watford Rural. The report proposed a total of fifty-two Greater London Boroughs, to be formed from the following existing areas:A Council for Greater London Proposed, The Times. 20 October 1960. #City of London #City of Westminster #Finsbury/Holborn/Shoreditch #Islington #Hackney/Stoke Newington #Bethnal Green/Poplar/Stepney #Woolwich #Deptford/Greenwich #Lewisham #Camberwell #Bermondsey/Southwark #Lambeth #Wandsworth (part) #Battersea/Wandsworth (part) #Hammersmith/Fulham #Kensington/Chelsea #Paddington/St Marylebone #Hampstead/St Pancras #Chingford/Walthamstow #Chigwell/Leyton/Wanstead and Woodford #Ilford #Romford #Hornchurch #Barking/Dagenham #East Ham #West Ham #Bexley/Crayford/Erith #Chislehurst and Sidcup/Orpington #Beckenham/Bromley/Penge #Croydon #Caterham and Warlingham/Coulsdon and Purley #Banstead/Epsom and Ewell #Beddington and Wallington/Carshalton/Sutton and Cheam #Merton and Morden/Mitcham/Wimbledon #Barnes/Richmond #Kingston upon Thames/Malden and Coombe/Surbiton #Esher/Walton and Weybridge #Feltham/Staines/Sunbury-on-Thames #Twickenham #Heston and Isleworth #Acton/Brentford and Chiswick #Ealing #Hayes and Harlington/Southall #Ruislip- Northwood/Uxbridge/Yiewsley and West Drayton #Harrow #Wembley #Willesden #Hendon #Barnet/East Barnet/Finchley/Friern Barnet #Hornsey/Southgate/Wood Green #Edmonton/Tottenham #Cheshunt/Enfield Government reaction and legislation By May 1961, the government had announced that a number of areas on the edge of the conurbation would be excluded from Greater London. It published a white paper on 29 November 1961 that accepted most of the recommendations. However, it felt education should be a borough-level function in most parts of the capital, with a single authority for central London. It also proposed larger, fewer boroughs.London Government: Government Proposals for Reorganization, Cmnd. 1562 In December, the government proposed that 34 boroughs, rather than 52, and detailed their boundaries.Government Plan for 34 London Boroughs. The Times, 19 December 1961. By the time of the introduction of legislation in 1962, the number of boroughs had been reduced to 32, and the area of Greater London again reduced by the exclusion of Banstead, Caterham and Warlingham, Cheshunt, Chigwell (except Hainault), Epsom and Ewell, Esher, Staines, Sunbury-on-Thames, and Walton and Weybridge.

As many bigleaguers, he saw his baseball career interrupted while serving in the US Navy during World War II. Evans reached the majors in with the Washington Senators, playing for them four years before joining the military (1943‚Äì44). He was released from the Navy in time for the end of the 1944 season with the Senators, staying with the club until 1950. His most productive season came in 1949, when he posted career-highs in games (109), batting average (.271), RBI (42), runs (32), and doubles. He also played briefly with the Boston Red Sox in , his last Major League season.

A *accurize, accurizing: The process of altering a stock firearm to improve its accuracy. *action: The physical mechanism that manipulates cartridges and/or seals the breech. The term refers to the method in which cartridges are loaded, locked, and extracted from the mechanism. Actions are generally categorized by the type of mechanism used. A firearm action is technically not present on muzzleloaders as all loading is done by hand. The mechanism that fires a muzzleloader is called the lock. *ammunition or ammo: Gunpowder and artillery. Since the design of the cartridge, the meaning has been transferred to the assembly of a projectile and its propellant in a single package. B *back bore, backbored barrel: A shotgun barrel whose internal diameter is greater than nominal for the gauge, but less than the SAAMI maximum. Done in an attempt to reduce felt recoil, improve patterning, or change the balance of the shotgun. *bandolier or bandoleer: A pocketed belt for holding ammunition and cartridges, usually slung over the chest. Bandoliers are now rare because most military arms use magazines, which are not well-suited to being stored in a bandolier. They are, however, still commonly used with shotguns, as a traditional bandolier conveniently stores individual shells. *barrel: A tube, usually metal, through which a controlled explosion or rapid expansion of gases are released to propel a projectile out of the end at high velocity. *ballistic coefficient or BC: a measure of projectiles ability to overcome air resistance in flight. It is inversely proportional to the deceleration‚Äîa high number indicates a low deceleration. BC is a function of mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. In bullets, it refers to the amount that drop over distance and wind drift affects the bullet. *bayonet lug: An attachment point for a bayonet. *belt: An ammunition belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into some machine guns in place of a magazine. *belted magnum or belt: Any caliber cartridge, generally rifles, using a shell casing with a pronounced \\"belt\\" around its base that continues 2-4mm past the extractor groove.Reloading Belted Magnums by Larry Willis This design originated with the British gunmaker Holland & Holland for the purpose of headspace certain of their more powerful cartridges. Especially the non-shouldered (non-\\"bottlenecked\\") magnum rifle cartridges could be pushed too far into the chamber and thus cause catastrophic failure of the gun when fired with excessive headspace; the addition of the belt to the casing prevented this over-insertion. *bipod: A support device that is similar to a tripod or monopod, but with two legs. On firearms, bipods are commonly used on rifles to provide a forward rest and reduce motion. The bipod permits the operator to rest the weapon on the ground, a low wall, or other object, reducing operator fatigue and permitting increased accuracy. *black powder also called gunpowder: a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. It burns rapidly, producing a volume of hot gas made up of carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen, and a solid residue of potassium sulfide. Because of its burning properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms and as a pyrotechnic composition in fireworks. Since 1886, most firearms use smokeless powder. *black-powder substitute: A firearm propellant that is designed to reproduce the burning rate and propellant properties of black powder (making it safe for use in black-powder firearms), while providing advantages in one or more areas such as reduced smoke, reduced corrosion, reduced cost, or decreased sensitivity to unintentional ignition. *blank: A type of cartridge for a firearm that contains gunpowder but no bullet or shot. When fired, the blank makes a flash and an explosive sound (report). Blanks are often used for simulation (such as in historical reenactments, theatre and movie special effects), training, and for signaling (see starting pistol). Blank cartridges differ from dummy cartridges, which are used for training or function testing firearms; these contain no primer or gunpowder, and are inert. *blowback: A system of operation for self-loading firearms that obtains power from the motion of the cartridge case as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gases created by the ignition of the powder charge.Chinn, George M.: The Machine Gun, Volume IV: Design Analysis of Automatic Firing Mechanisms and Related Components, p. 3. Bureau of Ordnance, Department of the Navy, 1955. *bluing or blueing: A passivation process in which steel is partially protected against rust, and is named after the blue-black appearance of the resulting protective finish. True gun bluing is an electrochemical conversion coating resulting from an oxidizing chemical reaction with iron on the surface selectively forming magnetite (Fe3O4), the black oxide of iron, which occupies the same volume as metallic iron. Bluing is most commonly used by gun manufacturers, gunsmiths and gun owners to improve the cosmetic appearance of, and provide a measure of corrosion resistance to, their firearms. *bolt action: A type of firearm action in which the firearm's bolt is operated manually by the opening and closing of the breech (barrel) with a small handle. As the handle is operated, the bolt is unlocked, the breech is opened, the spent shell casing is withdrawn and ejected, the firing pin is cocked, and a new round/shell (if available) is placed into the breech and the bolt closed. *bolt thrust or breech pressure: The amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. *bolt: The part of a repeating, breech-loading firearm that blocks the rear opening (breech) of the barrel chamber while the propellant burns, and moves back and forward to facilitate loading/unloading of cartridges from the magazine. The extractor and firing pin are often integral parts of the bolt. *bore snake: A tool used to clean the barrel of a gun. *boresight: Crude adjustments made to an optical firearm sight, or iron sights, to align the firearm barrel and sights. This method is usually used to pre-align the sights, which makes zeroing (zero drop at XX distance) much faster. *brass: The empty cartridge case. *break-action: A firearm whose barrels are hinged, and rotate perpendicular to the bore axis to expose the breech and allow loading and unloading of ammunition. *breech pressure or bolt thrust: The amount of rearward force exerted by the propellant gases on the bolt or breech of a firearm action or breech when a projectile is fired. The applied force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. *buffer: component that reduces the velocity of recoiling parts (such as the bolt). *bullpup: a firearm configurations in which both the action and magazine are located behind the trigger. *burst mode: a firing mode enabling the shooter to fire a predetermined number of rounds, with a single pull of the trigger. *button rifling: Rifling that is formed by pulling a die made with reverse image of the rifling (the 'button') down the pre-drilled bore of a firearm barrel. See also cut rifling and hammer forging. C *caliber/calibre: In small arms, the internal diameter of a firearm's barrel or a cartridge's bullet, usually expressed in millimeters or hundredths of an inch; in measuring rifled barrels this may be measured across the lands (such as .303 British) or grooves (such as .308 Winchester) or; a specific cartridge for which a firearm is chambered, such as .44 Magnum. In artillery, the length of the barrel expressed in terms of the internal diameter. *caplock: an obsolete mechanism for discharging a firearm. *carbine: a shortened version of a service rifle, often chambered in a less potent cartridge or; a shortened version of the infantryman's musket or rifle suited for use by cavalry. *cartridge: the assembly consisting of a bullet, gunpowder, shell casing, and primer. When counting, it is referred to as a \\"round\\". *caseless ammunition: a type of small arms ammunition that eliminates the cartridge case that typically holds the primer, propellant, and projectile together as a unit. *Casket magazine: a quad stack box magazine. *centerfire: a cartridge in which the primer is located in the center of the cartridge case head. Unlike rimfire cartridges, the primer is a separate and replaceable component. The centerfire cartridge has replaced the rimfire in all but the smallest cartridge sizes. Except for low-powered .22 and .17 caliber cartridges, and a handful of antiques, all modern pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition are centerfire. *chain gun: type of machine gun or autocannon that uses an external source of power to cycle the weapon. *chamber: the portion of the barrel or firing cylinder in which the cartridge is inserted prior to being fired. Rifles and pistols generally have a single chamber in their barrels, while revolvers have multiple chambers in their cylinders and no chamber in their barrel. *chambering: inserting a round into the chamber, either manually or through the action of the weapon. *charger: a speedloader that holds several cartridges together in a single unit for easier loading of a firearm's magazine. A stripper clip is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function. *charging handle: device on a firearm which, when operated, results in the hammer or striker being cocked or moved to the ready position. *choke: a tapered constriction of a shotgun barrel's bore at the muzzle end. Chokes are almost always used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance *clip: a device that is used to store multiple rounds of ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into the magazine of a repeating firearm. This speeds up the process of loading and reloading the firearm as several rounds can be loaded at once, rather than one round being loaded at a time. *COL (cartridge overall length): Factory ammunition is loaded to a standard, SAAMI specified, Cartridge Overall Length so that the ammunition will reliably function in all firearms and action types. This specified O.A.L. has nothing to do with optimizing accuracy, and is typically much shorter than the O.A.L. used by handloaders for the same cartridge. For the last several decades, the rule of thumb was the closer you seated the bullet to the lands, the better the accuracy. Currently, it is understood that this isn't always true. It is true that some bullets and some rifles perform best when bullets are seated out long enough to touch the lands, but other bullets perform best when they have a certain amount of ‚Äújump‚Äù to the lands. The only rule is: there is no rule. *collateral damage: damage that is unintended or incidental to the intended outcome. The term originated in the United States military, but it has since expanded into broader use. *collimator sight: a type of optical \\"blind\\" sight that allows the user looking into it to see an illuminated aiming point aligned with the device the sight is attached to regardless of eye position (parallax free).Elementary optics and application to fire control instruments By United States. Dept. of the Army, section 8-24 The user can not see through the sight so it is used with both eyes open while one looks into the sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and then at the target, or using one eye to partially see the sight and target at the same time. Elementary optics and applications to fire control instruments: May, 1921 By United States. Army. Ordnance Dept, page 84 (variant names/types: \\"collimating sight\\",William C Farmer, Ordnance field guide, page 279\\"occluded eye gunsight\\" (OEG).Jan Kay, International Defense Directory, 1991‚Äì92, page 241) *combination gun: a shoulder-held firearm that has two barrels; one rifle barrel and one shotgun barrel. Most combination guns are of an over-under design (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked vertically on top of each other, but some combination guns are of a side-by-side design (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other. *cordite: a family of smokeless propellants developed and produced in the United Kingdom from 1889 to replace gunpowder as a military propellant. Like gunpowder, cordite is classified as a low explosive because of its slow burning rates and consequently low brisance. The hot gases produced by burning gunpowder or cordite generate sufficient pressure to propel a bullet or shell to its target, but not enough to destroy the barrel of the firearm, or gun. *CQB: close-quarters combat or close quarters battle is a type of fighting in which small units engage the enemy with personal weapons at very short range, potentially to the point of hand-to-hand combat or fighting with hand weapons such as swords or knives. * cylindro-conoidal bullet: a hollow base bullet, shaped so that, when fired, the bullet expands and seal the bore. It was invented by Captain John Norton of the British 34th Regiment in 1832, after he examined the blow pipe arrows used by the natives in India and found that their base was formed of elastic locus pith, which by its expansion against the inner surface of the blow pipe prevented the escape of air past it.Of Arms and Men By Robert L. O'Connell p.191 D A view of the break-action of a side-by-side double-barrelled shotgun. *damascus barrel or damascus twist: An obsolete method of manufacturing a firearm barrel made by twisting strips of metal around a mandrel and forge welding it into shape. See also Damascus steel. *direct impingement: A type of gas operation for a firearm that directs gas from a fired cartridge directly to the bolt carrier or slide assembly to cycle the action. *doglock: The lock that preceded the 'true' flintlock in both rifles and pistols in the 17th century. Commonly used throughout Europe in the 1600s, it gained popular favor in the British and Dutch military. A doglock carbine was the principal weapon of the harquebusier, the most numerous type of cavalry in the armies of Thirty Years War and the English Civil War era. *double-barreled shotgun: A shotgun with two barrels, usually of the same gauge or bore. The two types of double-barreled shotguns are over/under (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked on top of each other, and side-by-side (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other. For double-barreled guns that use one shotgun barrel and one rifle barrel, see combination gun. *double rifle: A rifle that has two barrels, usually of the same caliber. The two types of double rifles are over/under (abbreviated as O/U), in which the two barrels are stacked on top of each other, and side-by-side (abbreviated as SxS), in which the two barrels sit beside each other. For double-barreled guns that use one shotgun barrel and one rifle barrel, see combination gun. *drilling: a firearm with three barrels (from the German word drei for three). Typically it has two barrels side by side on the top, with a third rifle barrel underneath. This provides a very versatile firearm capable of taking winged animals as well as big game. It also is useful in jurisdictions where a person is only allowed to own a single firearm. *drum magazine: a type of firearms magazine that is cylindrical in shape, similar to a drum. *dry fire: the practice of \\"firing\\" a firearm without ammunition. That is, to pull the trigger and allow the hammer or striker to drop on an empty chamber. *dum-dum: A bullet designed to expand on impact, increasing in diameter to limit penetration and/or produce a larger diameter wound. The two typical designs are the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet. *dummy: A round of ammunition that is completely inert, i.e., contains no primer, propellant, or explosive charge. It is used to check weapon function, and for crew training. Unlike a blank it contains no charge at all. *dust cover: a seal for the ejection port (which allows spent brass to exit the upper receiver after firing) from allowing contaminants such as sand, dirt, or other debris from entering the mechanism. E *electronic firing: The use of an electric current to fire a cartridge, instead of a percussion cap. In an electronic-fired firearm an electric current is used instead to ignite the propellant, which fires the cartridge as soon as the trigger is pulled. *eye relief: For optics such as binoculars or a rifle scope, eye relief is the distance from the eyepiece to the viewer's eye that matches the eyepiece exit pupil to the eye's entrance pupil. Short eye relief requires the observer to press their eye close to the eyepiece in order to see an un- vignetted image. For a shooter, eye relief is an important safety consideration. An optic with too short an eye relief can cut skin at the contact point between the optic and the shooter's eyebrow due to recoil. *expanding bullet: An expanding bullet is a bullet designed to expand on impact, increasing in diameter to limit penetration and/or produce a larger diameter wound. The two typical designs are the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet. *extractor: A part in a firearm that serves to remove brass cases of fired ammunition after the ammunition has been fired. When the gun's action cycles, the extractor lifts or removes the spent brass casing from the firing chamber. F *falling block action (also known as a sliding-block action) is a single-shot firearm action in which a solid metal breechblock slides vertically in grooves cut into the breech of the rifle and actuated by a lever. In the top position, it locks and resists recoil while sealing the chamber. In the lower position, it leaves the chamber open so the shooter can load a cartridge from the rear. *Ferritic nitrocarburizing: A case hardening processes that diffuse nitrogen and carbon into ferrous metals at sub-critical temperatures to improve scuffing resistance, fatigue properties and corrosion resistance of metal surfaces. Also called nitriding. *Field Strip: Disassembling a firearm for the purpose of repair or cleaning, without tools. When using tools, this is called a detail strip. *fire forming: the process of reshaping a metallic cartridge case to fit a new chamber by firing it within that chamber.Glenn Newick, \\"The Ultimate in Rifle Accuracy\\" , Stroger Publishing Company, 1989. *forcing cone: The tapered section at the rear of the barrel of a revolver that eases the entry of the bullet into the bore. *flintlock: an obsolete mechanism for discharging a firearm. *fouling shot: A fouling shot is a shot fired through a clean bore, intended to leave some residue of firing and prepare the bore for more consistent performance in subsequent shots. The first shot through a clean bore behaves differently from subsequent shots through a bore with traces of powder residue, resulting in a different point of impact. Also, the Fouling Shot Journal, a publication of the Cast Bullet Association *forward assist: A button, found commonly on M16 and AR-15-styled rifles, usually located near the bolt closure, that when hit, pushes the bolt carrier forward, ensuring that the bolt is locked. *fouling: The accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces. The fouling material can consist of either powder, lubrication residue, or bullet material such as lead or copper. *frangible: A bullet that is designed to disintegrate into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration for reasons of range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the danger behind the intended target. Examples are the Glaser Safety Slug and the breaching round. *frizzen: an \\"L\\" shaped piece of steel hinged at the rear used in flintlock firearms. The flint scraping the steel throws a shower of sparks into the flash pan. G *gas check is a device used in some types of firearms ammunition when non-jacketed bullets are used in high pressure cartridges, to prevent the buildup of lead in the barrel and aid in accuracy. *gas-operated reloading: a system of operation used to provide energy to operate autoloading firearms. *gauge: The gauge of a firearm is a unit of measurement used to express the diameter of the barrel. *general purpose machine gun: a machine gun intended to fill the role of either a light machine gun or medium machine gun, while at the same time being man-portable. *grain is a unit of measurement of mass that is based upon the mass of a single seed of a typical cereal. Used in firearms to denote the amount of powder in a cartridge or the weight of a bullet. Traditionally it was based on the weight of a grain of wheat or barley, but since 1958, the grain (gr) measure has been redefined using the International System of Units as precisely . Online copies. There are 7,000 grains per avoirdupois pound in the Imperial and U.S. customary units. *grip safety: A safety mechanism, usually a lever on the rear of a pistol grip, that automatically unlocks the trigger mechanism of a firearm as pressure is applied by the shooter's hand. *gunpowder, also called black powder, is a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. It burns rapidly, producing a volume of hot gas made up of carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen, and a solid residue of potassium sulfide. Because of its burning properties and the amount of heat and gas volume that it generates, gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms and as a pyrotechnic composition in fireworks. The term gunpowder also refers broadly to any propellant powder. Modern firearms do not use the traditional gunpowder (black powder) described here, but instead use smokeless powder. H *hammer bite: The action of an external hammer pinching or poking the web of the operator's shooting hand between the thumb and fore-finger when the gun is fired. Some handguns prone to this are the M1911 pistol and the Browning Hi-Power. *hang fire: An unexpected delay between the triggering of a firearm and the ignition of the propellant. This failure was common in firearm actions that relied on open primer pans, due to the poor or inconsistent quality of the powder. Modern weapons are susceptible, particularly if the ammunition has been stored in an environment outside of the design specifications. *half-cock: The position of the hammer where the hammer is partially but not completely cocked. Many firearms, particularly older firearms, had a notch cut into the hammer allowing half-cock, as this position would neither allow the gun to fire nor permit the hammer-mounted firing pin to rest on a live percussion cap or cartridge. The purpose of the half-cock position has variously been used both for loading a firearm, and as a safety-mechanism. revolver hammer *hammer: The function of the hammer is to strike the firing pin in a firearm, which in turn detonates the impact-sensitive cartridge primer. The hammer of a firearm was given its name for both resemblance and functional similarity to the common tool. *headspace: The distance measured from the part of the chamber that stops forward motion of the cartridge (the datum reference) to the face of the bolt. Used as a verb, headspace refers to the interference created between this part of the chamber and the feature of the cartridge that achieves the correct positioning.Davis, William C., Jr. Handloading (1981) National Rifle Association pp.67‚Äì69 *headstamp: A headstamp is the markings on the bottom of a cartridge case designed for a firearm. It usually tells who manufactured the case. If it is a civilian case it often also tells the caliber, if it is military, the year of manufacture is often added. *heavy machine gun: a larger class of machine gun. *high brass: A shotgun shell for more powerful loads with the brass extended up further along the sides of the shell, while light loads use \\"low brass\\" shells. The brass does not provide significantly more strength, but the difference in appearance helps shooters quickly differentiate between high and low powered ammunition. * Holographic weapon sight: a non-magnifying gun sight that allows the user to look through a glass optical window and see a cross hair reticle image superimposed at a distance on the field of view.Red Dot Sights / Reflex Sights & Holosights Explained -Electronic Sights; A look at why they exist, how they work, and how you use them. The hologram of the reticle is built into the window and is illuminated by a laser diode. I .243 Winchester Ackley Improved (left) and .243 Winchester (right) *improved cartridge: A wildcat cartridge that is created by straightening out the sides of an existing case and making a sharper shoulder to maximize powder space. Frequently the neck length and shoulder position are altered as well. The caliber is NOT changed in the process. *IMR powder or Improved Military Rifle: A series of tubular nitrocellulose smokeless powders evolved from World War I through World War II for loading military and commercial ammunition and sold to private citizens for reloading rifle ammunition for hunting and target shooting. *improvised firearm: a firearm manufactured by someone who is not a regular maker of firearms. *internal ballistics: A subfield of ballistics, that is the study of a projectile's behavior from the time its propellant's igniter is initiated until it exits the gun barrel. The study of internal ballistics is important to designers and users of firearms of all types, from small-bore Olympic rifles and pistols, to high-tech artillery. *iron sights are a system of aligned markers used to assist in the aiming of a device such as a firearm, crossbow, or telescope, and exclude the use of optics as in a scope. Iron sights are typically composed of two component sights, formed by metal blades: a rear sight mounted perpendicular to the line of sight and consisting of some form of notch (open sight) or aperture (closed sight); and a front sight that is a post, bead, or ring. J jacketed bullets *jacket: A metal, usually copper, wrapped around a lead core to form a bullet. *jeweling: a cosmetic process to enhance the looks of firearm parts, such as the bolt. The look is created with an abrasive brush and compound that roughs the surface of the metal in a circular pattern. K *keyhole or keyholing: Refers to the end- over-end tumbling of the bullet which will often leave an elongated or keyhole shaped hole in a paper target. This occurs when the bullet is insufficiently stabilised by the firearm's rifling, either because the rifling is too slow or long for a given bullet, also meaning that the bullet is too long or tail heavy for said rifling. Or else due to poor fit of an undersize bullet in the gun barrel. In these cases the bullet has a natural tendency to wobble, and may start to tumble end-over-end just encountering the resistance of the air. Keyholing can also occur in wounding (human or animal), when the bullet is sufficiently stabilised for penetrating the air only, but not for penetrating denser media such as bone or flesh. In these cases tumbling starts at some point inside the victim's body, subsequently causing massive wounding. When using a bullet/rifling combination which is just sufficiently stabilised for normal flight though free air, and so to easily produce massive keyhole wounds in the victim, then keyholing may occur quite easily in flight if any obstacle is encountered, be it a twig, leaf, even a blade of grass or a large rain- drop. *Khyber Pass copy: a firearm manufactured by cottage gunsmiths in the Khyber Pass region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. *kick: The recoil or backward momentum of a firearm when it is discharged. Newton's third law suggests that the recoil of the arm should be exactly equal and opposite to forward momentum of the projectile(s). However the muzzle blast will normally add its own momentum to that of the projectile, so too increasing total recoil of the arm ‚Äì unless the muzzle blast's effect is (partially) neutralised, or even reversed, by means of a muzzle brake. L *length of pull: The distance between the trigger and the butt end of the stock of a rifle or shotgun. *lever-action is a type of firearm action with a lever that encircles the trigger guard area, (often including the trigger guard itself) to load fresh cartridges into the chamber of the barrel when the lever is worked. *light machine gun: a class of machine gun often defined as being designed for carry and use by a single operator, firing the same intermediate-power cartridge as other soldiers in the team. *lightweight compact revolver or [LCR] *live fire exercise or LFX: Any exercise that simulates a realistic scenario for the use of specific equipment. In the popular lexicon this applies primarily to tests of weapons or weapon systems associated with a branch of a nation's armed forces, though the term can also apply to civilian activity. *lug: any piece that projects from a firearm for the purpose of attaching something to it. For example, barrel lugs are used to attach a break-action shotgun barrel to the action itself. If the firearm is a revolver, the term may also refer to a protrusion under the barrel that adds weight, thereby stabilizing the gun during aiming, mitigating recoil, and reducing muzzle flip. A full lug extends all the way to the muzzle, while a half lug extends only partially down the barrel. On a swing-out-cylinder revolver, the lug is slotted to accommodate the ejector rod. M *machine gun: a fully automatic mounted or portable firearm. *machine pistol: a handgun-style fully automatic or burst-mode firearm. *magazine: A magazine is an ammunition storage and feeding device within or attached to a repeating firearm. Magazines may be integral to the firearm (fixed) or removable (detachable). The magazine functions by moving the cartridges stored in the magazine into a position where they may be loaded into the chamber by the action of the firearm. *match grade: Firearm parts and ammunition that are suitable for a competitive match. This refers to parts that are designed and manufactured such that they have a relatively tight-tolerances and high level of accuracy. *matchlock: an obsolete mechanism for discharging a firearm. *medium machine gun: a class of machine gun often defined as being designed for carry and use by multiple operators, firing a full-power rifle cartridge. *muzzle: The part of a firearm at the end of the barrel from which the projectile exits. *muzzle brakes and recoil compensators: devices that are fitted to the muzzle of a firearm to redirect propellant gases with the effect of countering both recoil of the gun and unwanted rising of the barrel during rapid fire. *muzzle energy is the kinetic energy of a bullet as it is expelled from the muzzle of a firearm. It is often used as a rough indication of the destructive potential of a given firearm or load. The heavier the bullet and the faster it moves, the higher its muzzle energy and the more damage it does. *muzzle velocity is the speed at which a projectile leaves the muzzle of the gun. Muzzle velocities range from approximately for some pistols and older cartridges to more than in modern cartridges such as the .220 Swift and .204 Ruger. In conventional guns, muzzle velocity is determined by the quality (burn speed, expansion) and quantity of the propellant, the mass of the projectile, and the length of the barrel. N *necking down or necking up refers to shrinking or expanding the neck of an existing cartridge to make it use a bullet of a different caliber. A typical process used in the creation of wildcat cartridges. *NRA or National Rifle Association of America is an American organization that lists its goals as the protection of the Second Amendment of the United States Bill of Rights and the promotion of firearm ownership rights as well as marksmanship, firearm safety, and the protection of hunting and self-defense in the United States. The NRA is also the sanctioning body for most marksmanship competition in the United States, from the local to the Olympic level (particularly bullseye style events). O *out-of-battery: The status of a weapon before the action has returned to the normal firing position. The term originates from artillery, referring to a gun that fires before it has been pulled back into its firing position in a gun battery. In firearms where there is an automatic loading mechanism, a condition in which a live round is at least partially in the firing chamber and capable of being fired, but is not properly secured by the usual mechanism of that particular weapon can occur. *over-bore: Small caliber bullets being used in very large cases. It is the relationship between the volume of powder that can fit in a case and the diameter of the inside of the barrel or bore. *obturate: An ordnance word; to close (a hole or cavity) so as to prevent a flow of gas through it, especially the escape of explosive gas from a gun tube during firing. The process of obturation is where a recess in the base of a bullet allows for expanding gases to press against the base and inside skirt of the bullet creating a gas tight seal to the bore. See also swage. *offset mount: Is where it may not be practical to mount a telescopic sight directly above the receiver and barrel of a firearm. This was noted with many military and service arms where new ammunition must be fed from above along a similar path, in reverse, to the spent cartridge cases being ejected clear. Not often seen or used today, although complete or partial sets of offset mounts attract keen interest from restorers and collectors. *Open Tip Match: The open tip design employs a precision deep drawn jacket with lead inserted from the front tip and ogival forming from the open tip mouth, and originated strictly for competitive match.. P *parkerizing: A method of protecting a steel surface from corrosion and increasing its resistance to wear through the application of an electrochemical phosphate conversion coating. Also called phosphating and phosphatizing. *Parts Kit: A kit of firearm parts minus the receiver. Used to build a complete firearm with the purchase or manufacture of a receiver (the US regulated part) *percussion cap: a small cylinder of copper or brass that was the crucial invention that enabled muzzle-loading firearms to fire reliably in any weather. The cap has one closed end. Inside the closed end is a small amount of a shock-sensitive explosive material such as fulminate of mercury. The percussion cap is placed over a hollow metal \\"nipple\\" at the rear end of the gun barrel. Pulling the trigger releases a hammer, which strikes the percussion cap and ignites the explosive primer. The flame travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge. *Picatinny rail: a bracket used on some firearms to provide a standardized mounting platform. *pinfire: an obsolete type of brass cartridge in which the priming compound is ignited by striking a small pin that protrudes radially from just above the base of the cartridge. *plinking: Informal target shooting done at non-traditional targets such as tin cans, glass bottles, and balloons filled with water. *POA: point of aim. *POI: point of impact. *powerhead or bang stick: a specialized firearm used underwater that is fired when in direct contact with the target. *pump-action: A rifle or shotgun in which the handgrip can be pumped back and forth to eject a spent round of ammunition and to chamber a fresh one. It is much faster than a bolt-action and somewhat faster than a lever-action, as it does not require that the shooter remove their trigger hand during reloading. In rifles, this action is also commonly called a slide action. R *ramrod: a device used with early firearms to push the projectile up against the propellant (mainly gunpowder). *rate of fire: the frequency at which a firearm can fire its projectiles. *receiver: the part of a firearm that houses the operating parts. *recoil: The backward momentum of a gun when it is discharged. In technical terms, the recoil caused by the gun exactly balances the forward momentum of the projectile, according to Newton's third law. (often called kickback or simply kick) *recoil operation: Recoil operation is an operating mechanism used in locked-breech, autoloading firearms. As the name implies, these actions use the force of recoil to provide energy to cycle the action. *Red dot sight a type of reflector (reflex) sight for firearms that gives the uses a red light-emitting diode as a reticle to create an aimpoint. *Reflector (reflex) sight: A generally non-magnifying optical device that has an optically collimated reticle, allowing the user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see a parallax free cross hair or other projected aiming point superimposed on the field of view.Elementary optics and application to fire control instruments By United States. Dept. of the Army, page 8-27, 8-28 Invented in 1900 but not generally used on firearms until reliably illuminated versions were invented in the late 1970s (usually referred to by the abbreviation \\"reflex sight\\"). *revolver: a repeating firearm that has a cylinder containing multiple chambers and at least one barrel for firing. *ricochet: ( ) is a rebound, bounce or skip off a surface, particularly in the case of a projectile. *rifle bedding: a process of filling gaps between the action and the stock of a rifle with an epoxy based material. *rifling: Helical grooves in the barrel of a gun or firearm, which imparts a spin to a projectile around its long axis. This spin serves to gyroscopically stabilize the projectile, improving its aerodynamic stability and accuracy. *rimfire: A type of firearm cartridge that used a firing pin to strike the base's rim, instead of striking the primer cap at the center of the base of the cartridge to ignite it (as in a centerfire cartridge). The rim of the rimfire cartridge is essentially an extended and widened percussion cap that contains the priming compound, while the cartridge case itself contains the propellant powder and the projectile (bullet). *rolling block: A form of firearm action where the sealing of the breech is done with a circular shaped breechblock able to rotate on a pin. The breechblock is locked into place by the hammer, thus preventing the cartridge from moving backwards at the moment of firing. By cocking the hammer, the breechblock can be rotated freely to reload the weapon. *round: a single cartridge. S *sabot: a device used in a firearm to fire a projectile, such as a bullet, that is smaller than the bore diameter. *safety: A mechanism used to help prevent the accidental discharge of a firearm, helping to ensure safer handling. Safeties can generally be divided into sub-types such as internal safeties (which typically do not receive input from the user) and external safeties (which typically allow the user to give input, for example, toggling a lever from \\"on\\" to \\"off\\" or something similar). Sometimes these are called \\"passive\\" and \\"active\\" safeties (or \\"automatic\\" and \\"manual\\"), respectively. *sawed-off shotgun/short-barreled shotgun (SBS): a type of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel and often a shorter or deleted stock. *selective fire: A firearm that fires semi‚Äìautomatically and at least one automatic mode by means of a selector depending on the weapon's design. Some selective fire weapons utilize burst fire mechanisms to limit the maximum or total number of shots fired automatically in this mode. The most common limits are two or three rounds per pull of the trigger. *semi-wadcutter or SWC: A type of all-purpose bullet commonly used in revolvers that combines features of the wadcutter target bullet and traditional round nosed revolver bullets, and is used in both revolver and pistol cartridges for hunting, target shooting, and plinking. The basic SWC design consists of a roughly conical nose, truncated with a flat point, sitting on a cylinder. The flat nose punches a clean hole in the target, rather than tearing it like a round nose bullet would, and the sharp shoulder enlarges the hole neatly, allowing easy and accurate scoring of the target. The SWC design offers better external ballistics than the wadcutter, as its conical nose produces less drag than the flat cylinder. *shooting range: a specialized facility designed for firearms practice. *shooting sticks: are portable weapon mounts. *short-barreled rifle (SBR): a legal designation in the United States, referring to a shoulder- fired, rifled firearm with a barrel length of less than 16\\" (40.6 cm) or overall length of less than 26\\" (66.0 cm). *single-action: Usually referring to a pistol or revolver, single-action is when the hammer is pulled back manually by the shooter (cocking it), after which the trigger is operated to fire the shot. See also double-action. *single-shot: A firearm that holds only a single round of ammunition, and must be reloaded after each shot. *slamfire: a premature, unintended discharge of a firearm that occurs as a round is being loaded into the chamber. *sleeving: A method of using new tubes to replace a worn-out gun barrel. *slide bite or Snake bite: A phenomenon often grouped with hammer bite‚Äîin this case the web of the shooting hand is cut or abraded by the rearward motion of the semi-automatic pistol's slide, not by the gun's hammer. This most often occurs with small pistols like the Walther PPK and Walther TPH that have an abbreviated grip tang. This problem is exacerbated by the sharp machining found on many firearms. *sling: is a type of strap or harness designed to allow an operator carry a firearm (usually a long gun such as a rifle, carbine, shotgun, or submachine gun) on his/her person and/or aid in greater hit probability with that firearm. *snubnosed revolver: a revolver with a short barrel length. *speedloader: A device used for loading a firearm or firearm magazine with loose ammunition very quickly. Generally, speedloaders are used for loading all chambers of a revolver simultaneously, although speedloaders of different designs are also used for the loading of fixed tubular magazines of shotguns and rifles, or the loading of box or drum magazines. Revolver speedloaders are used for revolvers having either swing- out cylinders or top-break cylinders. *spitzer bullet: an aerodynamic bullet design. *sporterising, sporterisation, or sporterization: The practice of modifying military-type firearms either to make them suitable for civilian sporting use or to make them legal under the law. *squib load, also known as squib round, pop and no kick, or just squib: A firearms malfunction in which a fired projectile does not have enough force behind it to exit the barrel, and thus becomes stuck. Squib loads make the firearm unsafe to shoot, unless the projectile can be removed. *stock: The part of a rifle or other firearm, to which the barrel and firing mechanism are attached, that is held against one's shoulder when firing the gun. The stock provides a means for the shooter to firmly support the device and easily aim it. *stopping power: The ability of a firearm or other weapon to cause a penetrating ballistic injury to a target, human or animal, sufficient to incapacitate the target where it stands. *stripper clip: A speedloader that holds several cartridges together in a single unit for easier loading of a firearm's magazine. A stripper clip is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function. *silencer, suppressor, sound suppressor, sound moderator, or \\"hush puppy\\": A device attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon. *swage: To reduce an item in size by forcing through a die. In internal ballistics, swaging refers to the process where bullets are swaged into the rifling of the barrel by the force of the expanding powder gases. *swaged bullet: A bullet that is formed by forcing the bullet into a die to assume its final form. *swaged choke: A constriction or choke in a shotgun barrel formed by a swaging process that compresses the outside of the barrel. *swaged rifling: Rifling in a firearm barrel formed by a swaging process, such as button rifling. T *Taylor KO Factor: mathematical approach for evaluating the stopping power of hunting cartridges, which favors cartridges with a high momentum and a large bullet diameter. *telescoping stock or collapsing stock: A stock on a firearm that can telescope or fold in on itself to become more compact. Telescoping stocks are useful for storing a rifle or weapon in a space that it would not normally fit in. *terminal ballistics: A sub-field of ballistics, is the study of the behavior of a projectile when it hits its target.Terminal Ballistics Test and Analysis Guidelines for the Penetration Mechanics Branch - BRL *Throat Erosion (firearms): The wearing of the portion of the barrel where the gas pressure and heat is highest as the projectile leaves the chamber. The greater the chamber pressure, the more rapid throat erosion occurs. This is compounded by rapid firing, which heats and weakens the steel. *trigger: A mechanism that actuates the firing sequence of a firearm. Triggers almost universally consist of levers or buttons actuated by the index finger. *trunnion: a cylindrical protrusion used as a mounting and/or pivoting point. On firearms, the barrel is sometimes mounted in a trunnion, which in turn is mounted to the receiver. U *upset forging: A process that increases the diameter of a workpiece by compressing its length. *underlug: 1. The locking lugs on a break-action firearm that extend from the bottom of the barrels under the chamber(s) and connect into the receiver bottom. 2\\\\. The metal shroud underneath the barrel of a revolver that surrounds and protects the extractor rod. The two types of underlugs include half-lug, meaning the shroud does not run the entire length of the barrel but instead is only as long as the extractor rod, and full-lug, meaning the shroud runs the full length of the barrel. *underwater firearm: a firearm specially designed for use underwater. V varmint rifle *varmint rifle: A small-caliber firearm or high-powered air gun primarily used for varmint hunting‚Äîkilling non-native or non-game animals such as rats, house sparrows, starling, crows, ground squirrels, gophers, jackrabbits, marmots, groundhogs, porcupine, opossum, coyote, skunks, weasels, or feral cats, dogs, goats, pigs and other animals considered a nuisance vermin destructive to native or domestic plants and animals.Craige, Captain John Houston (1950). The Practical Book of American Guns. Bramhall House. pp. 211‚Äì222. W *wadcutter: A special-purpose bullet specially designed for shooting paper targets, usually at close range and at subsonic velocities typically under . They are often used in handgun and airgun competitions. A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target to the favor of the shooter. *WCF: An acronym for a family of cartridges designed by Winchester Repeating Arms Company, called Winchester Center Fire, as in the .30-30 WCF or .32 WCF. *wheellock: an obsolete mechanism for discharging a firearm. *wildcat cartridge or wildcat: A custom cartridge for which ammunition and firearms are not mass-produced. These cartridges are often created to optimize a certain performance characteristic (such as the power, size or efficiency) of an existing commercial cartridge. See improved cartridge. *windage: The side-to-side adjustment of a sight, used to change the horizontal component of the aiming point. See also Kentucky windage. X *x-ring: a circle in the middle of a shooting target bullseye used to determine winners in event of a tie. Y *yaw: The heading of a bullet, used in external ballistics that refers to how the Magnus effect causes bullets to move out of a straight line based on their spin. Z *'zero-in or ': The act of setting up a telescopic or other sighting system so that the point of impact of a bullet matches the sights at a specified distance. *zero stop, a stopping mechanism found on some scope sights letting the user easily dial back their sight to the zeroing distance after having adjusted their sight to shoot at other distances.

Dr. Jafari's achievements in the development of concepts and technology systems in Learning Management Systems (LMS) have earned him recognition as one of Indiana's leading high-tech success stories and a global unofficial title of father of LMS. Jafari is considered as one of the global pioneers in envisioning and developing new eLearning systems and pedagogical methods https://inventors.iu.edu/inventors/jafari-ali.html. Ali Jafari is currently working as a Professor of Computer and Information Technology at the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology and as the Director of the CyberLab at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). He earned his BS in Business Administration from the University of Isfahan, Iran, before he moved to the United States to pursue a MS in Media Technology at the University of Wisconsin. He completed his doctorate studies in Telecommunications and Mass Communication from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. Professor jafari ePortfolio is available online at http://theCN.com/AJ10  Background  Dr. Jafari has contributed his entrepreneurial savvy to three books, co-editing and authoring Handbook of Research on ePortfolios, Designing Portals and Course Management Systems for Learning: Beyond Accidental Pedagogy Additionally, Dr. Jafari has rolled out his research projects in five open source and commercial companies. He has presented papers and delivered keynote addresses in over two hundred national and international conferences. His research has been published in professional and scholarly journals on a variety of subjects in information technology. His research interests include user interface design, smart learning environments, distance learning, and intelligent agents both from conceptual and architectural perspectives, which guide the Professor‚Äôs passion for improving the integration of technology into teaching and learning. Dr. Jafari wants to see the milestones of research go further than the acquisition of knowledge. In order to tackle real life problems, he feels, \\"It would be progress if higher education were to put a greater emphasis on commercialization of discoveries‚Äîperhaps even assigning commercialization the same level of importance as getting published and attracting grants‚Äù. In the future, he hopes to further develop products for commercialization to effectively exploit the uses and opportunities of modern technology in education.  LMS Project Background  Based on industry observations in 1997 (the WebLab group began trials with off-the-shelf software) including pre-existing commercially viable systems, WebCt '95, Courseinfo/Blackboard '96-'97, VCU's Web Course in a Box, D2L '99, and Real Education/eCollege '96, now Pearson Learning Studio, Jafari developed three of his own LMS university projects. These included 1) Indiana University's (1999) Oncourse project, 2) the ANGEL Learning Management System (2000) and 3) the Epsilen Environment 2004. The state of the LMS marketplace, commercially viable and open source projects, and the history can be seen here in a LMS Spring 2016 Report From the Industry. and a full listing can be found on Wikipedia at History of virtual learning environments .  Indiana University's WebLab 1996  The CyberLab, previously called WebLab, opened at IUPUI in 1996 and serves as a research and development laboratory for the IUPUI campus, employing personnel directed by Computer Information Technology professor, Ali Jafari. Although other commercial LMS systems existed, an idea to develop a computer program to create a Web environment for every course at IUPUI began in the fall of 1997 at the WebLab (now called CyberLab)(1) Laboratory on the IUPUI campus. The initial research system became Indiana University's OnCourse R&D; project founded by Chris Clapp and Tony Leonard and the system was widely deployed at IUPUI campus-wide in January 1999. Dr. Ali Jafari served as the project director and system architect for the design and development of the Oncourse R&D; Project and David Mills served as the lead system engineer. In 2004, four leading U.S. universities, together with Jasig, the parent organization of the uPortal framework, began a collaboration to combine and synchronize their assorted learning software into a collection of integrated, open source tools. Their primary goal was to improve teaching, learning and research by providing a compelling alternative to proprietary enterprise learning systems; an innovative platform for learning and collaboration that is produced by and for the higher education community. In order to meet the enterprise systems, support and scalability required by more than one institution, parts of the OnCourse \\"homegrown\\" project were folded into Sakai. The development of Sakai (software) was originally funded by a grant from the Mellon Foundation as the Sakai Project. The early versions of the software were based on existing tools created by the founding institutions, with the largest piece coming from the Indiana University \\"Oncouse\\" and University of Michigan's \\"CHEF\\" course management system. \\"Sakai\\" is a play on the word ‚Äúchef,‚Äù and refers to Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai.  Angel Learning (2000)  In spring of 1999, the WebLab group, under their new Laboratory organization named CyberLab, continued their Oncourse R&D; project in the direction of the development of \\"A New Global Environment for Learning or ANGEL. ANGEL‚Äîthe next generation of Oncourse. In 2000, with seed funding from Indiana University, Jafari founded Angel Learning Inc. with David Mills, a 1999 graduate of the School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI. By bringing in previous leaders of the eCollege team, doing exploration and additive research on Blackboard's commercially viable product (David Mills visited Blackboard's offices in late 1999), and providing a lower cost solution than its competitors' ANGEL Learning became commercially viable, and an industry competitor.Under Christopher Clapp, and Ray Henderson's leadership (a former eCollege employee), ANGEL Learning was acquired (May 2009) by Blackboard.  Epsilen Learning (2008)  By forming a partnership and securing venture capital from The New York Times Company, a new LMS was deployed, called Epsilen. Epsilen was built by an Indian outsourcing company DiaSpark, and led by former Blackboard/WebCT employee (Evan Nisonson August 2010 ‚Äì October 2012). Headquartered in Indianapolis Epsilen then merged into the New York Times as a content management system. Epsilen no longer competes in the LMS market space.  Current Project: CourseNetworking  Jafari's most recent LMS technology based company, CourseNetworking LLC (The CN) www.theCN.com began in 2011 with seed funding from Indiana University and Dr. Jafari. The CN combines social networking with Learning Management System (LMS) and ePortfolio offering a totally new concept and technology for today's learners. It offers functionalities of LMS, ePortfolio, and Social Networking within one single interface and one software package (both mobile and web) as SAS throughout the world. The CN holds more than a dozen of patent claims for its unique methods offering new LMS and social networking functions among the learners throughout the world.

Since 1991, the program has been hosted by farmer, writer and public intellectual Phillip Adams, who refers to the program by its acronym 'LNL', which during 2016 morphed into 'FNL'. Previous hosts include publisher and journalist Richard Ackland, and Virginia Bell, now a judge of the High Court of Australia. Recent guest hosts include: Tracey Holmes, Richard Aedy, and Paul Barclay. Often the setting for a serious and learned discussion of politics, science, philosophy and culture, the program aims to host cutting- edge discussion of public debate, and present ideas and issues not yet covered by other Australian media. The programme is broadcast from 10:05 pm until 11 pm Mondays to Thursdays, and is repeat broadcast at 4:05 pm from Tuesdays to Fridays. During January of each year, selected segments from the previous 10 or 11 months are re-broadcast, in lieu of fresh programming. In 2011 a special online retrospective was compiled to celebrate 20 years behind the LNL microphone, called \\"In Bed With Phillip\\". Over 200 of the best interviews from these years are now available to listen and download.  Regular contributors  Regular contributor each Tuesday is Bruce Shapiro, an American journalist and Director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma. Shapiro and Adams usually discuss contemporary USA politics, though the discussion can often be wide-ranging and include global politics. And a weekly discussion with Laura Tingle about the political events of the week. Less frequent regular contributors include the economist Satyajit Das, Beatrix Campbell on British politics. Guests Include high-profile thinkers, writers, journalists and players from the literary, cultural and political world. Over the past 21 years guests have included Henry Kissinger, Christopher Hitchens, Gore Vidal, Madeleine Albright, Gerry Adams, Jessica Mitford and former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev.  Format  Most programs are divided into three segments, each segment delineated by a sting, a short piece of instrumental music lasting about 30 seconds, though occasional one-hour conversations involving one or more guests are becoming more frequent. Adams' style is conversational and casual, not adversarial. He introduces his guests using their first and last names, followed by their qualifications and notable positions and achievements, and subsequently addresses them by their first name. When a guest is a university professor occupying a named chair, Adams usually asks the guest to briefly explain who or what the chair is named after. The pace is relaxed. Adams generally exerts subtle but firm control over the conversation's direction. For many years, Adams has referred to his audience as \\"Gladys\\", the joke being that only one person is listening and that is her name. With the advent of podcasting and web streaming, Adams has since added \\"Poddies\\" to his listenership, and will often talk or refer to his \\"Gladdies and Poddies\\". He also has Noddies (who fall asleep to his program) and Maddies (who write him vitriolic letters), and now \\"Tweethearts\\" to include those who follow him on Twitter. Production The program has a staff of four: Adams, an executive producer, and three producers (who each do one night shift per week.) Technical producer also puts the program to air each night. Though Adams may make suggestions, the producers decide on the topic and guests, and they suggest questions, which Adams may take or leave. Audience In 2010 the estimated cumulative audience (number who listened during the past week) was 350,000, and the show was downloaded 217,463 times in August. Seventy five percent of downloads are to Australia, 6% to the US and 3% to Britain. It is the second most popular of all ABC radio programs, following Richard Fidler's Conversations. Sixty five percent of listeners are university graduates; 90% are forty or older; 40% hold \\"AB\\" (e.g., white collar) jobs while 45% are not in the workforce (retired or home duties ‚Äì not unemployed), and 55% are women. Theme music The current theme music is the first movement of Brescianello's violin concerto no. 4 in e-minor, Op. 1. Until March 2016 the theme was the Eliza Aria from the Wild Swans ballet by Elena Kats-Chernin.Have your say on the new Late Night Live Theme Music This replaced Russian Rag also by Kats-Chernin, which Adams jokingly referred to as the 'Waltz of the Wombats'. Several different arrangements have been used: Clarinet, trumpet, marimba, harp, violin, viola, cello, double bass; Flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, 2 violins, viola, cello, double bass; Flute, piano, cello; Bassoon with piano; Clarinet with piano; Violin with piano and unaccompanied Piano. The previous theme, adopted soon after Adams took over as host, was the third movement of Johann Sebastian Bach's Concerto for Violin and Oboe, BWV 1060.

The second ship to be named Avenge by the Navy, AM-423 was laid down on 1 August 1951 at Stamford, Connecticut, by the Luders Marine Construction Co.; launched on 15 March 1953; sponsored by Mrs. A. E. Luders, Jr.; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 13 May 1954, Lt. Waymon Taylor in command. Avenge was reclassified as Ocean Minesweeper MSO-423 on 14 January 1955.  Commissioned as a new minesweeper  After completing shakedown training, the minesweeper sailed on 6 August for her home port, Charleston, South Carolina, and arrived there on 8 August. She conducted local operations until entering the Charleston Naval Shipyard on 14 January 1955 for conversion. During this period, her designation was changed to MSO-423, before she resumed her activities in April and began preparations for deployment.  First ‚ÄúMed‚Äù cruise  On 6 September, Avenge sailed for the Mediterranean. Her ports of call during that deployment with the U.S. 6th Fleet included Gibraltar; Barcelona, Spain; Nice, Cannes, and Toulon, France; Monaco; Valletta, Malta; Naples, Italy; and Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands. The ship left Gibraltar on 17 January 1956 and arrived back in Charleston on the 31st. Following leave and upkeep, the ship sailed on 9 April for the coast of Nova Scotia and participated in minesweeping operations off Halifax before getting underway on 14 May to return to her home port.  North Atlantic operations  The vessel operated for two months in the Charleston area, then left on 16 July to return to Canadian waters. She spent two months assisting in survey and beach clearance operations in connection with DEW line radar sites. The ship left St. Johns, Newfoundland, on 4 September, and arrived back in Charleston on 11 September.  Second Med cruise  Avenge returned to Argentia, Newfoundland, on 15 January 1957, took part in cold weather minesweeping operations, and then got underway for New York on 30 January. She touched at Charleston on 7 February and held local operations through 29 August. On that day, the minesweeper sailed for the Mediterranean. After reaching Gibraltar, she visited Valletta, Malta; Suda Bay, Crete; Kos Island, Greece; Gaeta and Naples, Italy; and Izmir, Turkey. While deployed with the 6th Fleet, she conducted joint exercises with the Italian Navy at Gaeta. She also held combined operations with the Royal Navy at Malta in January 1958. After five months in the Mediterranean, Avenge returned to Charleston on 13 February.  East Coast operations  In late March, the ship took part in amphibious exercises at Onslow Beach, North Carolina, and in mine exercises at Little Creek, Virginia. Avenge departed Charleston on 11 January 1959, bound for Savannah, Georgia, where she arrived on the 12th and entered the shipyard of the Savannah Machine and Foundry Co. for overhaul. The minesweeper returned to Charleston on 14 March for refresher training. During May and June, she took part in a mine test in the Charleston area before sailing once more on 24 July for the Mediterranean.  Return to the Mediterranean  While on duty with the 6th Fleet, Avenge took part in numerous exercises. The largest came in Octoter at La Spezia, Italy, when she joined units of the French, Greek, Turkish, Belgian, and Italian navies in Exercise \\"Gauge.\\" She returned to Charleston on 11 February 1960. The ship departed Charleston on 23 May to participate in Operation Springboard, in the Caribbean. In July, she carried out an assignment off Cape Canaveral, Florida, and then proceeded to her home port for overhaul.  Caribbean operations  Avenge headed back to the Caribbean in January 1961 for amphibious exercises which lasted well into February. After returning home, she made an unscheduled deployment to the Caribbean in April in response to a political crisis in the Dominican Republic and did not get back to Charleston until August. Thereafter, type training and minesweeping exercises off the South Carolina coast kept her busy through the end of 1961. In January 1962, Avenge operated from Panama City, Florida, providing services for the Naval Mine Defense Laboratory and reported back to her home port in February. Following an overhaul, she returned to Panama City in August. Intensive minesweeping training exercises in company with Mine Division 82 occupied her time in October and November.  European operations  Early in January 1963, the ship took 19 days to cross the Atlantic due to winter storms as she embarked upon another Mediterranean tour during which she took part in several combined exercises and visited ports in Italy(Naples, La Spezia, Livorno, Augusta Bay), Greece (Kalamata, Thessalonika), and France. Avenge participated in NATO Exercise \\"Fair Game\\" before returning to Charleston on 5 June. Following leave and upkeep, she proceeded to Panama City to work with the Naval Mine Defense Laboratory. The minesweeper reported back to Charleston on 20 November and began preparations for a deployment to the Caribbean. Avenge won the Marjorie Sterrett Award as best ship of type in the Atlantic Fleet for 1963.  Caribbean tour of duty  In February 1964, the vessel began a two-month cruise to the Caribbean, working out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She arrived back in Charleston in April for leave and upkeep and then entered the naval shipyard at Charleston in May for repairs which were followed by refresher training and local operations. In late December, Avenge got underway for the Caribbean. She visited Guantanamo Bay; Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; and Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. The end of 1964 found Avenge anchored at Frederiksted, Saint Croix, in the American Virgin Islands.  Supporting missile test programs  During January and February 1965, Avenge operated out of Guantanamo Bay before arriving back at Charleston in March and resuming a full schedule of training exercises and operations. In August, she was part of the Gemini V recovery force off Cape Kennedy, Florida. In early December, the minesweeper took part in an amphibious exercise off Vieques, Puerto Rico, before returning to her home port for the Christmas holidays. In February 1966, the ship was part of the recovery force off Cape Kennedy during tests of the Apollo rocket and returned to Charleston in March and conducted local operations through June. She sailed to Savannah once more in early July for another period of overhaul, and she left the shipyard in September for refresher training in the Norfolk area.  Testing minesweep gear  The vessel returned to Panama City on 14 January 1967 and helped to test minesweeping gear being developed for use by helicopters. She visited the cities of Tampa, West Palm Beach, and Jacksonville, Florida, in February and arrived back at Charleston on 28 February. After a brief tender availability, Avenge provided services to the Mine Warfare School at Charleston before sailing for Newport, Rhode Island, on 2 May to conduct refresher training. Following a brief visit to Boston, Massachusetts, on 20 May, she arrived in Charleston on 26 May.  Repairs at Rota, Spain  The minesweeper entered Detyens Shipyard, Wando, South Carolina, on 17 July for alterations. Upon the completion of the modifications and repairs, she prepared for deployment and sailed on 16 August for the Mediterranean. After suffering extensive damage en route, Avenge reached Rota, Spain, on 2 September and remained there for repairs until sailing on 25 September for Izmir, Turkey, where she rejoined her division. She participated in exercises off Dikili, Turkey, with British and Turkish ships from 16 through 25 October. Avenge moved to Naples in early November for a tender availability and then visited La Spezia, Italy; Ajaccio and Lovo Santo, Corsica; and Toulon, France, before closing the year at Naples undergoing upkeep. An amphibious exercise took place at Porto Scudo, Sardinia, on 3 January 1968, 10 days before Avenge began her journey home on 13 January. She reached Charleston on 3 February and entered a leave and upkeep status. The minesweeper got underway on 15 April to take part in mine tests and returned to port on 26 May for a standdown period in preparation for her forthcoming modernization.  Severely damaged in a fire  Avenge was taken in tow on 26 August for the voyage to Baltimore, Maryland, where she entered the Bethlehem Steel Corporation's Key Highway Shipyard on 30 August. The yardwork continued into 1969. On 27 September, she was drydocked at Bethlehem's Fort McHenry Shipyard in Baltimore. A fire of unknown origin broke out on 6 October and caused extensive damage to the midships section of the vessel.  Decommissioning  A subsequent survey found that it would not be economically feasible to restore the vessel, and Avenge was decommissioned on 31 January 1970. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 February 1970.

It was closed in 1994. Think Big! logo History The store was a joint endeavor by two friends, an artist Phyllis Prinz and a business man Robert Malkin. The two, who had an affinity for collecting oversized antique display pieces, opened their store against the advice of friends and experts. The product line started with a small offering consisting of giant 6 foot pencils and replicas of giant 5-foot Crayola crayons.People Magazine, April 26, 1982: America's Love of Whimsy Made These Folks Blow Things Out of Proportion http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20082012,00.html The entrepreneurs had great success and expanded into a nationwide catalog retail concept. The Think Big! product line grew to offer over 100 different larger- than-life objects. With the added success of catalog sales many franchise locations began to open across the country as the pop art style caught on through the 1980s. The unique creations have been featured in many films including Forrest Gump and Big both starring Tom Hanks. Think Big! catalogs Think Big flourished in the 1980s, when the scaled-up aesthetic was popular. Other companies, such as Swatch, also created comically large versions of their wares. In the early 1990s the retailer was at its peak and was sold to the high-end art gallery firm Martin Lawrence Galleries. The gallery already had many retail locations and attracted the interest of pop art fans with their huge collection of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein artwork. However, the Think Big franchise stores began to disappear, subject to high-rent retail locations and increased expense for catalog production. By 1994, all retail locations of Think Big had been closed down by Martin Lawrence Galleries.L.A. Times, June 1993: \\"Martin Lawrence Sells Subsidiary to Stockholder\\" http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-01/business/fi-42173_1_martin-lawrence The gallery's collection of Warhol art was diminishing and the economy took a downturn. The gallery mailed out the last Think Big! catalog in 1994 and refocused on expanding its collection of high-end art to include a broader variety of printed artworks. After about 5 years in hibernation, the Think Big product line was rejuvenated by the boom of the Internet and the determination of Jeff Bruette when he founded GreatBigStuff. GreatBigStuff is an online-only retailer of oversized versions of everyday objects. In 2001, Bruette located a former Martin Lawrence executive who owned all of the remaining Think Big inventory from 1994 and worked out a trade agreement - three of Bruette's personal Warhol's in exchange for all the remaining inventory. GreatBigStuff have since redesigned and resurrected many of the original Think Big Products.

In appearance she was compared to Dorothy Gish, with her short fluffy hair and eyes which sparkled.  Career  She was an heiress who came to Hollywood after graduating from a school of dramatic art in Ohio, in 1917. Prior to this she studied at the Ursula Academy. May won a scholarship to do post-graduate work. Her father was opposed to her doing any type of acting, so she waited until after his death to pursue this venture. She went back to the dramatic school after a dissatisfying stay of three months in California. Her first roles were minor parts in the productions of Samuel Goldwyn and Famous Players-Lasky. She returned after receiving a wire from actor, Charles Ray, who said he had a role for her as leading lady in his film, Paris Green (1920). She had met Ray following a game of tennis at the Beverly Hills Hotel. By late 1919, she was earning an income of $200 per week making movies. May was among the supporting cast of Lombardi, Ltd. (1919), a movie which featured Bert Lytell. Released by Metro Pictures in October 1919, the Jack Conway directed film recreated a story which was previously acted on the stage. In the comedy the character Tito Lombardi exerts his influence on three women, two of them played by Alice Lake and Vera Lewis. May secured this role while conversing with Conway at a party. She later became acquainted with Pat Powers who gave her an opportunity at Universal Pictures. In The Half Breed (1922) May was paired with Wheeler Oakman in a Western produced by Oliver Morosco. The daring scenes she performed in this movie showed her talent as a performer. As an actress she was diverse enough to play a daring rider or a delicate society girl from the East. One film critic questioned why May was not a bigger star in her profession. He made reference to her \\"elfin humor, a tropical vampishness that is irresistible charm.\\" She was in The Dangerous Maid (1923), a production of Joseph Schenck which gave Constance Talmadge her first opportunity to act in a dramatic role. The setting of the film is England during the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth against James II. May began work on The End of the World in April 1924 after a break of several months, during which she performed on stage. She played the role of a vamp in Waking Up the Town (1925), which starred Norma Shearer and Jack Pickford. Directed by Vernon Keays, the movie was shot on location in Carmel, California. May was injured during filming when a large piece of wood struck her in the forearm during a most realistic action scene, which resembled an earthquake. She was forced to stop working for several days until her arm healed. In The Fighting Cub May had the leading feminine role in a feature about a cub reporter. Directed by Paul Hurst, the film costarred Mildred Harris and Pat O'Malley. The melodrama written by Phil Goldstone has Wesley Barry as the young reporter and O'Malley as the editor of a large daily newspaper.  Personal life  May became engaged to actor Ralph Graves after meeting him at the studio of D.W. Griffith. She practiced dancing with modern dance pioneer and choreographer, Ruth St. Denis, on the front lawn of May's Hollywood home. Early in her career May resided for a time at the Hollywood Studio Club. A petition filed in a Cincinnati Federal Court in September 1921 revealed that May was the beneficiary of an insurance policy taken out by E.M. Noel, a wealthy oil man who died in Cincinnati in January 1920. It was disclosed that Noel purchased two automobiles, jewelry, and advanced large sums of money, amounting to $30,000, to May. One of the cars had been recovered from May with the lawyer's advice. The $75,000 insurance benefit to May was cancelled by Noel upon the attorney's persuasion.

David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album 2 and a half stars out of five stating, \\"You don't have to look much farther than T.H.U.G.S. to see why fans complain about Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's quality control department. This set of \\"13 new songs\\" -- that's what the sticker Ruthless put on initial pressings declared -- is filled with titles that are familiar to Bone-loving message-board trollers and Internet traders, but somewhere along the way from leak to official release, the beats changed, often for the worse. Most everything seems to come from 2003 or so, a time when the Bone and Ruthless relationship was falling apart and two years before unpredictable member Bizzy was dismissed from the group. Hearing Bizzy's free- form rhyming and strange delivery during this turbulent time is interesting and a handful of cuts feature memorable lyrics and/or that prime Bone interplay, but there's an overall feeling that the music is unfinished, or maybe even finished years later by someone outside the Bone organization. Take the amateurish beat on \\"Sweet Jane,\\" which is a serious step down from the leaked version, or \\"Wildin',\\" where the music and lyrics just refuse to connect. Sounds like someone pitched down the vocals for both \\"I'm Bone\\" and \\"So Many Places\\" so they would match the music, but worst of all is the dramatic title cut, which serves as a six-minute meandering intro with almost no vocals. It's a shame this iffy odds-and-ends collection appeared the same year as Bone's major-label comeback, Strength & Loyalty. Luckily, longtime fans have already been trained on how to approach the group's fringe releases, and will lower their expectations accordingly.\\" Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews gave the album 7 and a half stars out of 10, stating \\"In the end what's going on here is perfectly obvious after adding all these clues up and listening to songs on T.H.U.G.S. Sooner or later you'll hear something you recognize from another Bone album, or Bone mixtape, or a song that was leaked to the internet around the time of \\"BTNHResurrection\\" or \\"Thug World Order\\" that for inexplicable reasons never appeared on those CD's. Quite simply this is a desperate Ruthless Records attempting to cash in on all of the available Bone Thugs material they have they could dig up out the vaults or remix to release. As such it's probably not entirely ethical to support an album like T.H.U.G.S., especially as it's likely none of the rappers involved will ever see a dime from it, and yet songs like the DJ Uneek produced \\"Everyday Thugs\\" and Rick Rock's \\"Not That Nigga\\" are the kind of classic smooth Bone shit fans have come to know and love, and for nostalgia's sake it is good to hear Bizzy reunited with his comrades. This album is right for all the wrong reasons, so the real shame of T.H.U.G.S. is that Bone's current label couldn't acquire these songs from their former label to promote them the RIGHT way. If you know what you're getting into and you're comfortable with the fact this is not really new material, T.H.U.G.S. is an acceptable album released in an appropriately \\"ruthless\\" manner.\\" Track listing=Appearances * Krayzie Bone appears on all tracks. * Layzie Bone appears on 12 tracks. * Bizzy Bone appears on 11 tracks. * Wish Bone appears on 11 tracks.

It is located in the western-central part of the city, surrounded by the boroughs of Pere≈°, Myslava, Barca, Juh and Z√°pad. Characteristics Lunik IX houses the largest community of Romani people in Slovakia. Although originally built for 2,500 inhabitants, it is estimated that the population is now three times larger. Living standards are low, with services such as gas, water, and electricity cut off, as the majority of inhabitants are not paying rent or utilities fees. Health standards are low and diseases such as hepatitis, head lice, diarrhea, scabies, and meningitis are common. Unemployment in the borough reaches almost 100 percent. It has one elementary school and a kindergarten. Lun√≠k IX is serviced by a bus line, which stops only on selected bus stops. Boarding the bus is only allowed through the front door. Due to frequent attacks of aggressive residents, bus drivers deployed on the line receive a hazard pay. History The Romani village close to the borough was demolished in 1979 and the Romani people were moved into Lun√≠k IX; in addition, there was a landfill nearby. As early as in the 1980s the Romani comprised half of the population, which was around 2,000. Over time, the non-Romani population gradually moved away, with the Romani taking flats after their departure, and the borough turned into a Romani ghetto. In 1995, the city council of Ko≈°ice created a plan for the living conditions of dodgers, the maladjusted, and people from illegally occupied flats around Ko≈°ice. They were to be moved into Lun√≠k IX, with \\"non- problematic\\" families being gradually moved out if they requested it. The realization of this plan is on-going.

When built, Amagi was the largest warship yet produced domestically in Japan. Amagi was named after the Mount Amagi, in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Background Amagi was designed as a wooden-hulled three- masted bark-rigged sloop with a coal-fired triple expansion reciprocating steam engine driving a single screw. Made mostly of pine wood, the wooden beams and metal fittings came from the mountains of central Izu Peninsula, which also provided the ship with its name. She was laid down at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 9 September 1875 under the direction of L√©once Verny, a French naval engineer initially hired by the Tokugawa shogunate, who stayed on as a foreign advisor to the early Meiji government as chief administrator and constructor of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. She was launched on 13 March 1877 and commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy on 4 April 1878.Chesneau, All the World‚Äôs Fighting Ships, p. 232. Her design was a scaled-up version of the corvette , also built at the same shipyards. Operational history With heightened tensions with Joseon dynasty Korea after the assassination of several members of the Japanese embassy in the Imo Incident, Amagi was assigned to patrols off the Korean coast as a show of force in the summer of 1882, with Lieutenant T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç as executive officer. T≈çg≈ç later was captain of Amagi in 1884, when it became the first Japanese warship to ascend the Yangzi River in China, making a port call at the treaty port at Wuhan. He also observed French naval operations off of Taiwan during the Sino-French War of 1884-1885. Amagi saw combat service in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Nashiba Tokioki, at the Battle of Lushunkou, Battle of Weihaiwei and the Battle of Yalu River. After the war, Amagi was re-designated as a second-class gunboat, and was used for coastal patrol duties. At that time, she underwent refit in Kobe. During the Russo-Japanese War, Amagi was assigned to be a guard ship at Yokohama port, however, before the end of the war she was declared obsolete and was struck from the navy list on 14 June 1905.Nishida, Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy On 24 November 1908, the demilitarized hulk was sold to the Toba Shosen Gakk≈ç, the predecessor of the Toba National College of Maritime Technology, where she was used as a training vessel.

He is a physically built striker who is good in the air and has a powerful left foot.  Club career  2011 Egyptian club Al Ahly signed the forward from Portuguese side Naval, on 19 July 2011, on a three-year contract worth $1.2 million ($400,000 per season). F√°bio J√∫nior was signed in order to strengthen the forward line, which consisted of the already formidable duo of Mohamed Nagy \\"Geddo\\" and Dominique Da Silva. However, Junior found games hard to come by often being relegated to the bench (or not even featuring in the match line-up) by then coach Manuel Jos√©. His first appearance would come in the CAF Champions League against MC Alger, replacing Emad Moteab in the 80th minute. Despite finding himself in a few scoring opportunities he was unable to grab a goal. It would be nearly two months before he made his long-awaited d√©but in the Egyptian Premier League, coming on as a substitute against Haras El Hodood. F√°bio would finish the year having played four games for Ahly, but was unable to score a goal. 2012 The turn of the year represented a new beginning for J√∫nior, as he would feature in three consecutive games against: El Gounah, El Daklyeh and El Geish. He finally scored his debut goal on the 1 February 2012, against Al- Masry. However, the celebrations were short lived as the match was marred by riots after the final whistle. During the post-match clashes, he was not injured. F√°bio J√∫nior would mark his return to continental football by scoring the opening goal of the tie against Ethiopian Coffee, in the Round of 32 in the CAF Champions League. He later featured in the squad for both legs of the Round of 16 tie with Stade Malien, but was an unused substitute in both matches, with Ahly winning 3-2 on aggregate, to reach the Quarter-finals.

The official language of Estonia is Estonian, an Uralic language which is related to Finnish. It is unrelated to the bordering Russian and Latvian languages, both of which are Indo-European (more specifically East Slavic and Baltic, respectively). Standard Estonian is mainly based on the North Estonian language, while South Estonian comprises several dialects, specifically V√µro, Mulgi and Tartu. V√µro, being furthest away from Standard Estonian, is the only one to have been given an ISO 639-3 language code by SIL (\\"vro\\"). V√µru is widely accepted to have a subdialect Setu, although some consider it a separate language.  Minority languages = Russian  Distribution of the Russian language in Estonia according to data from the 2000 Estonian census. Russian is by far the most spoken minority language in the country. There are towns in Estonia with large concentrations of Russian speakers and there are towns where Estonian speakers are in the minority (especially in the northeast, e.g. Narva).  German  The Baltic Germans (, or ') were mostly ethnically German inhabitants of the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, which today form the countries of Estonia and Latvia. The Baltic German population never made up more than 10% of the total. They formed the social, commercial, political and cultural √©lite in that region for several centuries. Some of them also took high positions in the military and civilian life of the Russian Empire, particularly in Saint Petersburg. Their history and presence in the Baltics came to an abrupt end in late 1939 following the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the subsequent Nazi-Soviet population transfers when almost all the Baltic Germans were resettled by the German Government into the Wartheland and Danzig-West Prussia. Today there are very few Germans living in Estonia aside from some temporary residents from Germany. The German language is the third most popular foreign language among Estonians.  Swedish  The Estonian Swedes, are a Swedish-speaking linguistic minority traditionally residing in the coastal areas and islands of what is now western and northern Estonia. The beginning of the continuous settlement of Estonian Swedes in these areas (known as Aiboland) dates back to the 13th and 14th centuries, when their Swedish-speaking ancestors arrived in Estonia from what is now Sweden and Finland. Almost all of Estonia's Swedish-speaking minority fled to Sweden during World War II, and only the descendants of a few individuals who opted to stay are permanently resident in Estonia today.  Sign languages  The Estonian Sign Language (ESL, ) is the national sign language of Estonia. In 1998 there were about 4,500 signers out a population of 1,600 deaf and 20,000 hearing impaired. It is widespread in the cities of Tallinn and P√§rnu among deaf ethnic Estonians; deaf Russian Estonians in Tallinn use Russian Sign Language, Russians outside Tallinn tend to use a Russian-Estonian Sign Language pidgin, or may be bilingual. In its formative stages, Estonian Sign Language was influenced by Russian and Finnish Sign Language; for example, the ESL sign for 'butterfly' developed from the Finnish sign for 'bird'. There are several dialects, the most archaic of which is the P√§rnu variety.

Other rugby league titles published by League Publications Ltd include the monthly magazine 'Rugby League World' and the annual 'Rugby League Yearbook'. It features match reports and pictures from every game played in the Betfred Super League, the Betfred Championship and Betfred League One, and the Australian National Rugby League (NRL). Coverage of the amateur game is also included, along with local and international rugby league related news. History The current incarnation of this publication is a merger of two previously existing titles, 'Rugby Leaguer' which can trace its origins back to the 1940s, and 'League Express', which first appeared on Monday 10 September 1990. League Express In 1990, Martyn Sadler (chairman) and Tim Butcher (managing director) believed that limited coverage of rugby league every Monday morning in the national newspapers had opened a niche market for a specialist rugby league newspaper to be published every Monday. The very first edition of League Express, edited by Mike Rylance, appeared on 10 September 1990. The first six editions of League Express were printed by the Yorkshire Weekly Newspaper Group at their Wakefield printing press, before production was transferred to Bradford, to the Telegraph and Argus press. At the start of the 1993/94 season Martyn Sadler became the managing editor of League Express. LPL decided to expand its production with a new title ‚Äì League Express Weekend ‚Äì edited by Tim Butcher and published each Friday during the season. In the years that followed, the Friday newspaper changed its title to Rugby League Weekend, Super League Week, and then Total Rugby League. At the end of the 2000 season League Publications Limited decided to convert its Total Rugby League newspaper into an online publication, TotalRL.com, which launched on 1 March 2001 and became one of the world's most popular rugby league sites. Rugby Leaguer & League Express In May 2002, League Publications Limited acquired the 'Rugby Leaguer' newspaper and merged it with League Express to create Rugby Leaguer & League Express.

Plot The film opens with an image of a man being burned alive on the floor of a warehouse. A figure, shrouded in darkness, walks away from this burning body in the down pouring rain. Suddenly, the film cuts to two men in the middle of a bank heist who, coolly and efficiently, partake stacks of bonds from a safety deposit box. The two men with two more accomplices, along with a hostage in their trunk, drive towards some unknown location away from the city, soon to be revealed as the very warehouse in which the man was previously seen being burned alive. Upon their arrival, one of the criminals, whose name is Ryu, enters the warehouse to discover, to his horror, that the man in which they were supposed to pass the bonds off to now is a charcoaled corpse lying in the middle of the floor. The other three criminals enter as well and are shocked as well at the sight. Questions begin to arise: what is their next plan of action? Do they wait until the mysterious man who hired them arrives, whom none of the criminals have met? Do they simply split the bonds and make a run for it? But soon the questions give way to accusations as the criminals begin to turn on one another, suspecting that one of them may, in fact, be the very man who hired them, and who must have set ablaze the now smoldering corpse. The rest of the film is told in a series of flashbacks that explain events that led up to the bank heist, which are intercut with scenes in the present as the criminals begin to probe one another for answers to this confusing puzzle...

Designed in 1935, it has housed the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs since its completion in 1959. A reference to \\"La Farnesina\\" is often to be intended as a metonymy for the hosted institution, namely the Ministry itself.  Structure  The nine storey building was designed in 1935 by architects Enrico Del Debbio, Arnaldo Foschini and Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo. It was originally designated to be the headquarters of Italy's National Fascist Party. Construction was halted in 1943 and throughout World War II. The facade consists of travertine. Though this type of facade is commonly linked to the rationalist style of Giuseppe Terragni, it is, in this case, derived from contemporary fascist ideals. The building consists of more than 1,300 rooms, is 169 meters in width, and 51 meters tall, and has a total internal volume of approximately 720,000 cubic meters. It is comparable in size to the Caserta Palace and is one of the largest buildings in Italy. The Palazzo della Farnesina was completed in 1959, varying only slightly from its original design. Upon completion, it consolidated the 13 separate offices of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since completion of the building, the word \\"Farnesina\\" has been used synonymously to refer to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Its name comes from the land on which it rises, the area between Monte Mario and the Tiber, which were called the Farnese Gardens (Orti della Farnesina) due to the ownership of Pope Paul III who was originally named Alessandro Farnese. The building should not be confused with the 16th- century Villa Farnesina, also often called simply \\"the Farnesina,\\" in Via della Lungara.  Art collection  In 1999 the Directorate General for Promotion and Cultural Cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched an initiative to allow public access to the collections of the Palazzo della Farnesina. This was done by opening galleries and collections to the public via a series of exhibitions with a focus on 20th century Italian art.The Ministry‚Äôs Art Collection on Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.

In April/May 2007 the band toured throughout the southern United States as part of a Hellcat Records package tour. Later that year, the band embarked on an extensive East Coast tour that stretched from Florida to Massachusetts, and included a handful of dates in the Mid-West (e.g. Chicago, Milwaukee, Cleveland) as well. Their first album, Heart and Scissor Killers featured all original members, Chase, Tuk, Dave, Paul, and Amos. The band was offered a place on the 2005 Warped Tour caravan but due to a scheduling conflict and unable to follow the tour, Amos was replaced by Brad, who became their steady drummer until 2007 when he made the decision to continue his education. During the Warped Tour, their bus broke down in California and with the aid of locals, they made their way back home to Atlanta. They also became acquainted with Tim Armstrong in this time period, and left Brand Name Records for a better-known label. This decision proved fruitful as the band released a more widely advertised album Hellbound and Heartless in 2006, featuring a duet between Chase Noles and guest singer Joan Jett. In late 2008, lead guitar player Tuk and bass player Portwood started a side project along with Joey from Vengeance 77 dubbed Poison Arrows. After lead vocalist Chase Noles was put into jail and bassist Portwood went back to rehab, the Heart Attacks called it quits. Now Tuk is playing in Biters. Chase has released music with Dinos Boys, and more recently with RMBLR (pronounced \\"rambler\\") with Joey on drums. Reunion The band has announced two reunion shows in their hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. On December 13 and 14, the band will be playing the Star Bar for two shows only.

Cooke (born 1923;Jisc library hub Discover died 2007) was a popular English broadcaster and writer, dedicated to making the Bible accessible to ordinary people. Cooke left school without any qualifications and one of his early jobs was cleaning the floors of the London Stock Exchange while he developed his career as a jazz clarinetist. Soon after becoming a believing Christian he was called up for Army service with the Royal Army Medical Corps and he served in Europe and India, being known throughout only for his clarinet and football skills. By the age of 23, Frank had never read a book. So the shock of being accepted as a student by a college of the University of Manchester was matched only by that of seeing his first 'required reading' book list. He persevered and became interested in helping others to whom reading is a 'closed book'. Later on, at the University of London, Frank studied for a Bachelor of Divinity degree. He became a Baptist minister and held pastorates at Bacup in Lancashire, at Hinckley, at Purley and at Andover. For four years he was the Interim Pastor of a new church at Amesbury until it became sufficiently large to call its first full-time minister. For fourteen years he was the chaplain of Spurgeon's College in London. He became a member of the Baptist Council and was elected President of the Baptist Union of Great Britain in 1983. He was experienced not only as a writer, but also as a broadcaster, having been involved in writing and presenting for many radio and TV programmes. Frank Cooke was the popular presenter on the weekly 'God slot' show on London's Capital Radio, and a regular contributor on BBC Radio 4, Transworld Radio, and many other stations. He died in 2007.

Isle in Villa Ada's lake. Villa Ada is a park in Rome, Italy, with a surface of it is the second largest in the city after Villa Doria Pamphili. It is located in the northeastern part of the city. History The wooded expanse was owned by the Italian royal House of Savoy in the latter half of the nineteenth century; it contained the royal residence (1872‚Äì1878). In 1878 the area came under the control of Count Tellfner of Switzerland, who named it in honor of his wife Ada. The royal family regained control of the land in 1904 but did not change the name. They retained control of the area until 1946. Present status Villa Savoia, now the Egyptian Embassy As of 2009 the area contains both public and private areas. The public area is controlled by the Council of Rome; the private area is controlled by the Egyptian Embassy, although the Town Council has made a formal claim to take control of the whole area. The private portion is under constant patrol by police or army personnel. Activities The public portion of the park is much larger than the private area. It contains an artificial lake and many trees, including stone pines, holm oaks, laurels and a very rare metasequoia, imported from Tibet in 1940. Entrance to the park is free. One may rent canoes, bicycles, or riding horses. There is a large swimming pool. Since 1994, during the summer the park hosts the world-music festival and the \\"Roma incontra il mondo\\" (Rome meets the World) festival, against racism, war and the death penalty. Entrance today to Bunker Villa Savoia The \\"Bunker Villa Ada Savoia,\\" a bunker built in the early 1940s by the House of Savoy to protect the King and Queen (King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Queen Elena) from Allied bombs, is now open for tours. The non-profit association, Roma Sotteranea, restored the bunker, which had fallen to ruin and had been vandalized, and runs the tours for a small cost. To date, all tours have been in Italian. Also, Benito Mussolini was taken captive by King Victor Emmanuel III during World War II from that house.

Kersal Moor, first called Karsey or Carsall Moor,Farrer, William and Brownbill, J. (editors) (1911). 'Townships: Broughton', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4, pp. 217‚Äì222. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41408. Date accessed: 20 February 2008 originally covered a much larger area, running down to the River Irwell. Evidence of activity during the Neolithic period has been discovered and the area was used by the Romans. It was the site of the first Manchester Racecourse and the second golf course to be built outside Scotland. It has been extensively used for other sporting pursuits, military manoeuvres and public gatherings such as the Great Chartist Meeting of 1838, prompting the political theorist Friedrich Engels to dub it \\"the Mons Sacer of Manchester\\". With the increasing industrialisation and urbanisation of Manchester and Salford during the 18th and 19th centuries, the moor became one of the remaining areas of natural landscape of interest to amateur naturalists, one of whom collected the only known specimens of the now extinct moth species Euclemensia woodiella. It is now a Site of Biological Importance and in 2007 was designated as a Local Nature Reserve by English Nature. Geography The sandhills on the north of the moor Kersal Moor is one of the many fluvioglacial ridges that formed along the Irwell Valley during the melting of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age. Typically for this type of landform, the subsoil is composed of sand mixed with coarse gravel. The 19th century botanist Richard Buxton described this as \\"Mr. E.W. Binney's drift deposit no.2 ... a deposit of sharp forest sand, parted with layers of gravel composed of Azoic, Palaeozoic and Triassic rocks, well rounded, parted with layers of fine sand, and having every appearance of a regular deposit by water.\\"Edward William Binney FRS FGS was a founder member of the Manchester Geological Society see: This deposit is overlaid with a thin topsoil supporting a range of mosses, heathers, grasses, ferns, common broom, gorse and some trees, which are predominantly oak with some rowan, cherry and other broadleaved species. The land to the south is elevated, rising to a high point towards the south-west. From this elevated position there are views across Manchester to the Derbyshire hills in the south, to the Pennines in the north east and across the Irwell Valley and Salford in the west. The land falls away to the north, ending with two drumlin-shaped hills on the northern edge, which were probably formed by sediment from the meltwater of the receding glaciers, in a process known as sedimentary fluting. The moor is criss-crossed with footpaths, many of which cut through to the sand and gravel below. Singleton Brook, to the north of the moor, denotes the boundary between Salford and Prestwich. History Flint scrapers, knives and other materials associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed the line of the A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated that there may have been a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium. The 18th century historian John Whitaker said of the moor: > \\"The moor of Kersal was in the time of the Romans, perhaps in that of the > Britons before them, and for many ages after both, a thicket of oaks and a > pasture for hogs; and the little knolls, that so remarkably diversify the > plain, and are annually covered with mingled crowds rising in ranks over > ranks to the top, were once the occasional seats of the herdsmen that > superintended these droves into the woods.\\" However, the last of these trees were burnt around 1880. Sport on the moor Manchester Racecourse on Kersal Moor The first Manchester racecourse was sited on the moor. The earliest record of horse-racing is contained in the following notice in the London Gazette of 2‚Äì5 May 1687: > On Carsall Moore near Manchester in Lancashire on the 18th instant, a 20¬£. > plate will be run for to carry ten stone and ride three heats, four miles > each heat. And the next day another plate of 40¬£. will be run for at the > same moore, riding the same heats and carrying the same weight. The horses > marks are to be given in four days before to Mr. William Swarbrick at the > King's Arms in Manchester. The racecourse is shown on the map of 1848 as a roughly oval-shaped course extending around the west, north and east of the moor, crossing Moor Lane and carrying on around the ground that is now the home of Salford City F.C., roughly following the line of what is now Nevile Road. John Byrom (1692‚Äì1763), the owner of Kersal Cell, was greatly opposed to the racing and wrote a pamphlet against it, but the racing continued for fifteen years until, probably through Dr Byrom's influence, they were stopped in 1746, the year of the Jacobite rising. After this there is known to have been at least one race in 1750; regular fixtures recommenced in 1759, and were then held every year until 1846, when they were transferred to the New Barns racecourse. Racing carried on there until the new Castle Irwell Racecourse was built, just across the river from the moor, in Lower Broughton in 1847. Today part of the course can still be seen as a wide, well-worn path stretching from east to west along the northern side of the moor. Heather and gorse During the 18th century the moor was also used for nude male races, allowing females to study the form before choosing their mates. Indeed, in 1796 Roger Aytoun, known as \\"Spanking Roger\\" (who was later a hero of the siege of Gibraltar) acquired Hough Hall in Moston through marriage to the widowed Barbara Minshull, after such a race.History of Kersal 2007-10-27 The moor has also been used for a number of other sporting activities. In the 18th and early 19th century archery was still practised as a village sport, and the archers of Broughton, Cheetham and Prestwich were renowned countrywide. The Broughton archers practised their sport on Kersal Moor and in 1793 the Manchester writer, James Ogden, composed a poem in praise of them, which begins: and ends with: By 1830, however, archery had become the sport of gentlemen and an exclusive club called the \\"Broughton Archers\\" was formed, the membership of which included some of the most influential men in the town. They originally met at a public house nicknamed \\"Hard Backed Nan's\\" on the site of Bishopscourt where the Bishop of Manchester now resides, but after Bury New Road was built and the site became too public, they moved to the Turf Tavern on Kersal Moor. In 1818 a golf course was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, some of whom had emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time consisted of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale. The archery ground became Kersal Cricket Ground in 1847 and in 1881 the Northern Tennis Tournament was staged there. In 1919 the ground became the home of Manchester's oldest rugby club, Manchester Football Club. When Manchester F.C. moved in 1968 they were replaced briefly by Langworthy Juniors and then Salford City F.C., who still lease the ground today. Public gatherings and military use As one of the largest open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army manoeuvres and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels referred to it as the Mons Sacer of Manchester. This was a reference to the hill to which the plebs (common citizens) of Rome withdrew en masse in 494 BC as an act of civil protest. In 1789 and 1790 there had been a spate of highway and house robberies. Gangs of armed men had entered houses in the middle of the night and taken away all they could carry. Armed patrols were placed around the neighbourhood to little effect until, at last, a man named James Macnamara was arrested with three others for burglary at the Dog and Partridge Inn on Stretford Road. Macnamara was tried at Lancaster Assizes and sentenced to be hanged on Kersal Moor as a warning to other criminals. A large number of people came to watch the execution but, as Joseph Aston said in his Metrical Records of Manchester \\"no one could suppose that the example had any use ... as several persons had their pockets picked within sight of the gallows and the following night a house was broken into and robbed in Manchester\\". The Stockport, Bolton and Rochdale Volunteers were reviewed on Kersal Moor on 25 August 1797 and in June 1812, 30,000 troops from the Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire, Louth and Stirling regiments were camped there ready for action to suppress the Luddites. In 1818 a protest meeting was held on the moor by coal miners to publicise their case for better pay, because of the dangers they faced at work. A duel was fought on the moor in July 1804 between Mr. Jones and Mr. Shakspere Philips. Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air, upon which the seconds interfered, the two man shook hands and honour was satisfied. Two weeks later, two other men who had been quarrelling in the newspapers met on the moor to gain satisfaction. However, the magistrates had been informed and the men were arrested before the duel could take place. On 12 April 1831 the 60th Rifle Corps had carried out an exercise on the moor under the command of Lieutenant P.S. Fitzgerald, and a detachment of 74 men were returning to their barracks in Salford by way of Lower Broughton and Pendleton. As the men were crossing the Broughton Suspension Bridge, built four years earlier by Fitzgeralds's father, they felt it begin to vibrate in time with their footsteps, and before they had reached the other side the bridge collapsed. Although no one was killed twenty men were injured, six of them seriously. It was this incident that caused the British Military to issue the order for soldiers to \\"break step\\" when crossing a bridge. In 1848, the moor was used as an encampment for the East Norfolk Regiment as part of an increased military presence in Lancashire brought about by the unrest caused by Chartist agitation. The largest of a series of Chartist meetings was held on the moor on 24 September 1838. The meeting, which was planned as a show of strength and to elect delegates for the Chartist national convention, attracted speakers from all over the country and a massive crowd, which was estimated at 30,000 by the Manchester Guardian and 300,000 by the Morning Advertiser. The Chartists were active for the next eight months but the poor attendance at a second meeting, held on the moor at the same time as a racing fixture on 25 May 1839, signalled the end of the movement. Although the movement was not successful initially, most of the Chartists' demands were eventually met by Parliament. Other pursuits John Curtis in British Entomology (1830) As a relatively rural environment in an increasingly urbanised area, Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and botanists. One of the botanists was Richard Buxton who went on to write A Botanical Guide to Manchester. In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on the moor. These turned out to be a previously unknown species of moth, but they were mistakenly attributed to a friend of Cribb's, the collector R. Wood, who had asked an expert to identify them. The moths were classified as Pancalia woodiella (today Euclemensia woodiella) in Wood's honour. > The only specimen I have seen of this beautiful Moth, which is larger than > the others, is a female; it was taken on Kersall-moor the middle of last > June by Mr. R. Wood, of Manchester, to whom I have the pleasure of > dedicating it;‚Äîa most zealous and successful naturalist, to whose liberality > I am indebted for many valuable insects. ‚Äì John Curtis writing in British > Entomology 1830 see also http://delta-intkey.com/britin/images/text3041.gif Enraged by this, and by accusations of fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up collecting and left the rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species. Towards the end of the 19th century, a Mr. Cosmo Melvill contributed an article to the Journal of Botany in which he gave a list of more than 240 plants and flowers, not including mosses, that he had found on the moor. A view of Manchester from Kersal Moor, by William Wyld in 1852. Shortly after 6:00 pm on 10 September 1848, the \\"celebrated aeronaut\\" George Gale ascended in a hot air balloon from Pomona Gardens in Hulme. After discharging a number of fireworks from a height of over 1,000 feet, Lieutenant Gale drifted in various directions and made abortive attempts to land in a number of locations. Eventually, at about 10:00 pm, the balloon descended safely in the farmyard of Mr Josiah Taylor on Kersal Moor. In 1852, Queen Victoria commissioned a painting by the artist William Wyld which became A view of Manchester from Kersal Moor (pictured). The painting, which depicts the moor as a beautiful pastoral scene overlooking Castle Irwell racecourse and the industrial landscape of Manchester, is now in the Royal Collection, where it is listed as Manchester from Higher Broughton. A steel line engraving of the painting by the engraver Edward Goodall was also commissioned. Literary references The English radical and writer Samuel Bamford mentions Kersal Moor in his book Passages in the Life of a Radical (1840‚Äì1844) when he advises one of his friends to make his way from Middleton to Bolton via Kersal Moor to avoid the authorities: > Healey I advised to go to his brother at Bolton, and get some money, and > keep out of sight entirely, until something further was known. His best way > would be to avoid Manchester, and go over Kersal moor and Agecroft bridge; > and as I had a relation in that quarter who wished to see me, I would keep > him company as far as Agecroft. The races on the moor were mentioned in the 19th-century novel The Manchester Man by Mrs. G Linnaeus Banks (1874). The hero of the story, Jabez Clegg, meets a street boy named Kit Townley, of whom Mrs. Banks says: > He knew him to be not over-scrupulous. He had seen him at Knott Mill Fair > and Dirt Fair (so called from its being held in muddy November), or at > Kersal Moor Races, with more money to spend in pop, nuts, and gingerbread, > shows and merry-go-rounds, flying boats and flying boxes, fighting cocks and > fighting men, than he could possibly have saved out of the sum his father > allowed him for pocket-money, even if he had been of the saving kind; and, > coupling all these things together, Jabez was far from satisfied. It is also mentioned in a collection of poems by Philip Connell called \\"Poaching on Parnassus\\" published in 1865. Lines to Mr. Isaac Holden by Philip Connell on his Drawing of the Prestwich Lunatic Asylum: > And Southward at due distance the huge hive, > Of busy Manchester is all alive, > Its towering chimnies, domes and steeples rise, > In strange confusion thro' the hazy skies; > There Broughton glimmers in the evening sun; > Here Cheetham Hill o'ertops the vapours dun; > There Kersal Moor the same bleak front doth shew, > That met the view Eight hundred years ago, > Where Clunian Monks there with their God did dwell, > Within the precincts of its holy cell. > In 1876 the Lancashire dialect poet and songwriter Edwin Waugh moved from his Manchester home to Kersal Moor for the \\"fresher air\\". Waugh's early life was spent in Rochdale and although he worked in Manchester he yearned for the moors he remembered from his youth. He wrote the following poem about Kersal Moor As his health declined, Waugh moved to the seaside town of New Brighton. On his death in 1890, his body was brought back to be buried in the graveyard of St. Paul's Church, on the edge of the moorland he loved so well.

Located north of the city center, in the northern part of the country, it is the second largest airport of Moldova, servicing cargo and charter flights. Another airport in the area, BƒÉl»õi City Airport, located within the city limits, is primarily used for emergency interventions of regional importance. History The first scheduled flights to BƒÉl≈£i started on 24 June 1926, on the route Bucharest ‚Äì Gala»õi ‚Äì Chi»ôinƒÉu - BƒÉl≈£i - Hotin - Cernauti. The flights were operated by Compagnie Franco-Roumaine de Navigation A√©rienne ‚Äì CFRNA, later LARES and today TAROM.https://romaniaimaginideierisiazi.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/transportului- aerian-in-bucovina-si-basarabia-interbelica/ Different locations of five runways in and around BƒÉl≈£i historically resulted that airport facilities were periodically built in different part of BƒÉl≈£i and its surroundings. The construction of the runway in the new location next to the village of Leadoveni (as it was called back in 1987 and later divided in Corlateni and Singureni, Corlateni corresponding to the area occupied today by the airport), on the outskirts of BƒÉl≈£i, 9 km from its northern districts started in 1980s following an order of the USSR Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev, whereas construction of the airport infrastructure (including passenger and cargo terminals, hotel, air traffic control tower, extension of the trolleybus line from BƒÉl»õi to BZY) was left to the local authorities. The choice of the runway location was carefully made taking into consideration the advanced technical and engineer means and notably the direction of winds and absence of stable fog on location of BƒÉl»õi International Airport. Contrary to other airports in Moldova, BƒÉl»õi International Airport can be operated in any weather conditions. The runway of BƒÉl»õi International Airport is located at an altitude of 231 meters, with surrounding hills as low as down to 100 meters. The first technical flight on the new BƒÉl»õi aerodrome was performed on 28 December 1987 on an An-24 by representatives of a test commission of the Moldovan Civil Aviation Authority. On 31 October 1989, the authority established the conformity of the aviation light signals installed at BZY. On 22 February 1990, the State Design and Prospecting Research Institute for Civil Aviation \\"Aeroproject\\" confirmed the pavement classification number and indicated the airplanes which may be operated at BZY with no restrictions : Il-18, An-12, Yak-42, Tu-134. On 8 June 1990, BZY was certificated, confirming that airplanes of type Tu-134, An-24, Yak-40 and other types of airplanes of the III rd and IV thcategories may be freely operated at BZY, as well as any kinds of helicopters. On 31 May 1994, \\"Aeroproject\\" confirmed also capacity of BZY for operation of Tu-154 (one plane per day) and Il-76T (50 planes per year with weight of 160 tons (352,740 pounds)). After the official opening in late 1980s, BZY appears to have been operated by airplanes from Chi»ôinƒÉu of the former Moldavian branch of the Soviet company Aeroflot. At that time, the airport was called BƒÉl»õi‚ÄìLeadoveni International Airport and became the most important airport in the north of Moldova. After the independence of Moldova in 1991, the airport was used by Air Moldova, the state company successor of the remaining airplanes of Aeroflot. According to the former plans, it was planned to build two terminals, one for passenger and another for cargo service, as well as one control tower. Before the break-up of the USSR, the airport was connected, through direct flights, to almost 20 destinations in the former Soviet Union, including Moscow, Kiev, and Sochi. Perspectives The new role for the BƒÉl»õi International Airport could be a first hub for low-cost airlines in Moldova, since the only airport which operates, as a monopoly holder, with high airport taxes regular passenger flights remains Chi»ôinƒÉu airport. Approximately one third or more of all passengers on the routes operated by Air Moldova having roughly half of the share of all flights from Chi»ôinƒÉu airport come from BƒÉl»õi and the northern districts of Moldova. Since May 2015 Air Moldova sells flight tickets with destination point BZY providing a bus transfer service from BƒÉl»õi to Chi»ôinƒÉu airport. Started from one bus per day in the beginning, there are three buses per day as of today circulating between BƒÉl»õi and Chi»ôinƒÉu airport and only for Air Moldova flights. Important development perspectives also appear for BƒÉl»õi International Airport in the cargo field, which would generate economic growth for the whole northern region of Moldova. The region boasts an 8% annual GDP growth, and real estate investment projects in BƒÉl»õi by Western European businesses are some of the growth factors. Facilities In accordance with activity plan report dated 1 March 2013, established in the framework of an inspection carried out by the Moldovan Civil Aviation Authority, the following services at BZY were verified: Passenger and Baggage ‚Äî General, Ticketing and airport services, Departing passengers processing, Arriving passengers processing, Baggage. Pursuant to a short notice published on the site of the Moldovan Ministry of Transports and Infrastructure of Roads, BZY is located on the territory of the Riscani region with a surface of 144,5567 ha and includes an aerodrome, a passenger terminal, a baggage handling facility, buildings and constructions ensuring technological process (a metallic hangar, a diesel electric generator for autonomous reserve energy, a square in front of the passenger terminal, parking lots for special purposes ground vehicles and others) as well as a land surface which may be used for infrastructure development of BZY. According to the decision No 32 of the Court of Auditors of Moldova dated 25 May 2007, the Balti International Airport was confirmed as corresponding to the ICAO requirements, although irregularly managed with inefficient accounting by the direction of Moldaeroservicehttp://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view;=doc‚ü®=1&id;=324856 On 30 August 2007, pursuant to the Decision No 987, the Government of Moldova decided to identify and realise measures for economic efficiency of the Balti International Airport (and Cahul airport) in the Republic of Moldova until 2012, to encourage and stimulate investments including the private ones in these airports.http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view;=doc‚ü®=1&id;=325222 On 29 October 2010, the Government of the Republic of Moldova adopted the decision No 983 pursuant to which it obliged the Free Economic Zone of Balti:ro:Zona economicƒÉ liberƒÉ BƒÉl»õi to build real estate assets on the territory of the Balti International Airport in exchange of the real estate assets transferred to the Free Economic Zone of Balti from the former Balti City Airport.http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view;=doc‚ü®=1&id;=336491 No construction works on the territory of the Balti International Airport started as of today, although the Free Economic Zone of Balti already built real estate assets for business purposes on the received land plots of the Balti City Airport. Operator On 12 September 1994, the Moldovan Civil Aviation Authority created the State Aviation Enterprise \\"Moldaeroservice\\". Moldaeroservice was created on the basis of the BƒÉl»õi Aviation Enterprise and BƒÉl»õi branch of the State Airline Air Moldova, and is subordinated to the Moldovan Civil Aviation Authority. Currently Moldaeroservice operates BƒÉl»õi International Airport, even though no regular flights are being operated and the operational certificate was withdrawn by Moldovan authorities on 14 October 2015, purportedly for the lack of financing of Moldaeroservice. As Moldova was experiencing economic crisis in the 1990s, the re-construction and modernization plans of the airport, as well as the whole aviation industry, were put on hold. Only in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Chi»ôinƒÉu International Airport was modernized, with help from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Chi»ôinƒÉu International Airport is today the only airport in Moldova operated by regular passenger and cargo routes. BƒÉl»õi International Airport is currently used mainly by irregular charter passenger, and more often by cargo flights. In between rare flights, the runway serves for Moldavian rallies and open-air concerts. Airlines and destinations As of 2020, there are no regular scheduled flights to and from BƒÉl»õi International. Access BƒÉl»õi International Airport is situated in the northern part of Moldova, near the city of BƒÉl»õi, one of the five Moldovan municipalities, on the land of the commune of CorlƒÉteni in R√Æ»ôcani district. It can be easily accessed by car, exiting BƒÉl»õi in the northern direction, and following the E583 highway. Numerous coaches and minibuses used for public transportation connecting BƒÉl»õi to the northern districts of Moldova stop upon request at the highway‚Äìairport access junction.

It is located on the north side of Douglas, Isle of Man; Douglas Station on the Isle of Man Railway is located on the south side of town, with the MER station being termed \\"Derby Castle\\" to differentiate between the two. Beginnings The site that now forms the station at Derby Castle is so called because the area to the north at that time housed the vast entertainment complex of the same name. The enterprising railway company owned the entire site, including the row of houses at Strathallan Crescent and the horse tram sheds and offices above. Behind this building lay the Calvary Glen which too was the property of the company until 1934. The houses of the crescent were sold off in 1978 when the entire railway network became government owned, and the railway's offices took up residence in the building above the horse tram sheds at this time also. This office is now in the ownership of the local authority and renamed the \\"Strathallan Suite\\". This area has been the terminus of the line since it opened in 1893. At the northerly end of the site was the main entrance to the ballroom complex, and later the car park for the now-demolished Aquadrome Swimming Pool & Sauna which was part of the Summerland complex. Booking Office The station still retains the original station booking office dating from 1897, built in a distinctive \\"rustic\\" style with half-log cladding, and steep alpine roofing. The facilities are basic and the office measures only 12' 6\\" by 8' (3.8 m by 2.4 m) and has room for station master and crew only; the station has never had its own toilets for instance, sharing facilities with the nearby Strathallan Hotel (latterly renamed \\"Terminus Tavern\\" as it is next to the electric and horse tram termini). Aside from the tarmacadam surfacing and modern shelter, the site remains unchanged since opening. Track There is a loop of track to allow the motor car to be shunted around the trailer car. Strathallan Hotel The pub next to the station, now called the \\"Terminus Tavern\\", was built in 1890 as the Strathallan Lodge, later becoming a hostelry and remained so until 1982 when it was given its current name. It was railway-owned until nationalisation in 1957, having been taken over by the local brewery at that time. It still forms an integral part of the station, the walls being lined with numerous photographs of the line and other handbills, posters, etc., and it still plays host to off-duty railway workers today. Canopy Until 1979 there was a large open roof known as the \\"Great Canopy\\". The stanchions for this canopy are now used as flagpoles and/or lampposts, and it can clearly be seen where the canopy was. The canopy, although erected by the railway, provided cover for the tramcars of the Douglas Bay Horse Tramway which also terminates here; the canopy originally featured detailed and intricate metalwork culminating in a central clock tower, distinctive on many early views, but latterly this was removed and a plain roof replaced it. Other structures In 1999 a long shelter was added, with a sign to say it was for use in connection with both the electric railway and bus services. Previously a defunct tramcar purchased from Lisbon, Portugal was housed on the siding to the side of the station, and this functioned as a waiting area until it was removed for off-site storage some time later, and now the station offers no cover for waiting passengers other than the incongruous modern shelter. For a short time in the 1980s, a horse car from the horse tramway was used as a shelter. Features The station is well known for its many and varied advertising signages, with many any varied styles in evidence denoting \\"The Highspot Of Your Holiday\\" in connection with a trip on the Snaefell Mountain Railway and \\"Shining By The Sea\\" for Royal Ramsey among the posters. The station is always covered with informative signage. A framed manually operated clock face attached to a traction pole shows the time of the next departure. For the line's centenary in 1993 large planters were added to the site.

The Helen and Felix Juda Gallery, also on the second level, is primarily reserved for Japanese prints displayed in rotating exhibits. The museum's collection includes traditional woodblock prints from the Edo period (1615‚Äì1868), as well as a large number of prints from the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912), Taish≈ç period (1912‚Äì1926), and the Sh≈çwa period (1926‚Äì1989). Print exhibitions change every three months and are based on periods, themes, or styles. The exhibition space in the Pavilion's East Wing displays a rotating selection of screens and hanging scrolls from the Edo period, including works from the Rimpa, ukiyo-e, and Maruyama-Shijo schools as well as spontaneous creations made by Zen monks. Works of art are exhibited on six levels within the East Wing. The plaza level contains the Raymond and Frances Bushell Netsuke Gallery, which holds an encyclopedic array of 827 works from the 17th through the 20th century. This gallery provides visitors with a 360-degree view of the miniature sculptures known as netsuke. In traditional Japan, netsuke were used as toggles and counterweights for suspending tobacco pouches and inro from the sash of men's kimonos.  Architecture  Designed by Bruce Goff, the 32,100-square-foot building is notable for its translucent fiberglass panels, which allow paintings to be lit safely and naturally by soft sunlight. The effect approximates the original viewing conditions for these paintings and allows gold leaf to reflect, creating dimensional levels within works of art not visible under artificial lighting. Japanese screens can be viewed at a distance, while scrolls can be viewed closer in alcove-like settings that suggest the tokonoma viewing area in a Japanese home. The pavilion also features a prow-shaped roof and cylindrical towers. The architectural landscape was designed by the firm of Hannah Olin.Sam Hall Kaplan (September 25, 1988), New Japanese Pavilion Is a Work of Art Itself: It May Look Like a Warrior's Helmet From Wilshire, But How It Works Inside Is What Counts Los Angeles Times.

Swisher has manufactured tobacco products since 1861 and ships more than two billion cigars a year to more than 70 countries. The company operates worldwide, with its headquarters in Jacksonville, Florida. It has manufacturing facilities in Wheeling, West Virginia and Santiago, Dominican Republic.  History Swisher traces its roots back to 1861 when David Swisher, a merchant out of Newark, Ohio, received a small cigar business in settlement of a debt. David and his four sons began to sell cigars across the Midwest from their ‚Äúrolling stores‚Äù or wagons. The cigars were rolled by hand every day in a one-room ‚Äúmanufactury‚Äù in Newark. In 1888, David's sons, John and Harry, bought the company from their father and renamed it Swisher Brothers. The company experienced great growth, and by 1895 the business had grown into three factories that employed over 1,000 people who hand-rolled as many as 300,000 cigars per day. In 1913, John bought out his brother, Harry, took on his own son, Carl, and renamed the company to Jno H. Swisher & Son. About ten years later, Carl selected Jacksonville, Florida when looking for a new home for their growing business due to the area's climate, shipping facilities, and proximity to raw materials and markets. Swisher has been headquartered in Jacksonville ever since. In 1923, Swisher was the first company to order rolling machines, which transformed the business by cost- effectively mass-producing cigars of great uniformity. The ‚Äúfresh work‚Äù machines went into operation in Jacksonville on June 20, 1924, and by the end of the 1920s, Swisher was making 100 million cigars a year. Swisher was also the first to wrap individual cigars in cellophane and the first to come up with a simple device for removing the cellophane by pulling the cigar band. By 1927, the Ohio facilities were closed and consolidated into the Florida operation. Even during the Great Depression, business was good and Swisher was hiring hundreds to keep up with the demand for its cigars. Swisher's hiring record earned the company Forbes magazine's Certificate of Merit for having ‚Äúthe vision, courage, and faith in America‚Äôs future to make large investments in the face of Depression problems.‚Äù During the same period and largely due to its investment in money-saving machinery, Swisher was able to cut the price of its King Edward Cigar from 5 cents each to 2 for 5 cents; it had been introduced in 1918 at 10 cents. Sales soared, and by the early 1940s, King Edward was the world's number one cigar. By 1941, the Jacksonville facility was the largest cigar factory in the world under one roof. It also housed the nation's first industrial children's nursery, which opened in 1939. In the following years, Swisher expanded by opening other facilities for handling, processing, storing, and shipping the huge quantities of tobacco needed in Jacksonville. In 1958, the machine-manufactured Swisher Sweets brand was introduced, and by 1964, the company was making four million cigars a day that were being shipped to all 50 states and to 47 foreign countries. Swisher acquired Universal Cigar in 1986, maker of the low-priced machine-rolled Optimo. In 1966, Swisher was purchased by William Ziegler III's American Maize-Products and he became chairman of the company, where he remained until his death in 2008. He was CEO by 1992 and changed the name to Swisher International. By 1995 Ziegler sold his American Maize-Products and kept (or bought back) Swisher, then took it public as Swisher International Group in December 1996. Golfer Bob Duval was endorsing the brand in 1998. In 2014, Swisher acquired Miami-based Drew Estate Tobacco Company that produces a variety of hand-rolled brands such as ACID, Herrera Estel√≠, Kentucky Fired Cured, Liga Privada, MUWAT, Natural, Nica Rustica, Nirvana Cameroon Selection, Tabak Especial, UnderCrown, and Java by Drew Estate. John Drew had started the company in 1996 with a stall at the World Trade Center. The Drew brand went through some upheaval after the acquisition, and John Drew was brought back as its president in 2016. President and CEO Peter Ghiloni, retired from Swisher in 2018. He had been appointed in 2012, coming from U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company. John Miller was named as president to replace Ghiloni. In august of 2020, Swisher International, Inc. announced the rebranding to Swisher. Swisher Sweets Original and Diamonds are the #1 and #2 best-selling large cigar in the U.S. Together, they account for more volume than the next five competitive large cigar items combined.

These are (by membership size): * Scottish Reserve League (involving some 3rd XVs) * the Edinburgh & Lothian 2nd XV League (also involving some 3rd XVs) * the Borders Championship In addition, a small competition is organised exclusively for 3rd (and some 4th) XVs: * the East of Scotland 3rd XV League 2nd XV rugby union (that is, matches for teams involving players not picked for their club's first team) is popular in Scotland, due to the amateur and social nature of the game. Most clubs run 2nd XV teams of one sort of another, although not all of these participate in leagues. The largest clubs (usually based in the cities) often have the player pool and finance to run 2nd, 3rd and even 4th XVs (and in very occasional circumstances even 5th and 6th XVs have been known). Smaller clubs may only occasionally be able to form 2nd XVs, and the smallest clubs will not have any kind of team apart from their first team. Many smaller clubs only play 2nd XV friendlies, when they can raise a team. Often, if a friendly is to be played, it is convenient to arrange it with the same opponents as the first team that weekend. Thus if team A are at home to team B on a main pitch, A's 2nd XV may well be playing a friendly v B's 2nd XV on a back pitch nearby. Or B's second XV may host A's second XV, if back pitches are not available. However, organised 2nd XV leagues operate on a pre- decided schedule. Some clubs that have amalgamated keep a 2nd XV team utilising the name of one of the former clubs. Note that a small number of clubs run 2nd XVs in the following leagues which include first team clubs as well: * Grampian Alliance League * Highland Alliance League University rugby in Scotland, including that for 2nd, 3rd and 4th XVs, is organised separately (although Edinburgh University run 2nd and 3rd XVs in The Scottish 2nd XV League.

Probably born at Yattendon Castle, William was the eldest son of Sir John Norreys of Ockwells and Yattendon and Lady Alice Merbrook, Lady of the Garter. Upon the death of his father, he inherited all of the family's properties, including Yattendon Castle, but excluding Ockwells, which he inherited in 1494 upon the death of his stepmother. Wars of the Roses William was a Lancastrian soldier in the Royal Army during the Wars of the Roses. He was knighted by King Henry VI at the Battle of Northampton, on 10 July 1460, when he was 20 years old. He was present at the Battle of Towton, on 29 March 1461, the largest and bloodiest battle of the wars. Though he survived the battle, when so few Lancastrians did, he was forced to make peace with the recently proclaimed King Edward IV. New monarchy Like his father, William adjusted to the new monarchy. By August 1461, he was appointed Steward of both the Royal manors of Cookham and Bray, adjoining his family estate of Ockwells. He was later appointed steward of nearby Foliejon Manor in Winkfield, in 1474. He was appointed Sheriff of Oxfordshire and Berkshire in 1468, positions he also held in 1482 and 1486. In 1467, he became Justice of the Peace for Berkshire. In 1469, Sir William was made Esquire of the Body to King Edward IV. During the rebellion of 1470, begun by Warwick, the 'Kingmaker', which briefly re-instated Henry VI as king, William may have fought on King Edward's side for he retained his position at court. He participated in the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471. Rebellion and exile In 1483, shortly after the July crowning of King Richard III, William reverted to his anti-Yorkist sympathies. In October 1483, he joined his younger brother, John, in the Duke of Buckingham's rebellion. The Duke assembled his forces at Brecon, while Sir William, accompanied by Sir William Berkeley of Beaverstone and Sir Richard Woodville, gathered rebels at Newbury. Buckingham was, however, captured and executed. William fled West when a reward was offered for his capture. He was eventually rounded up in Devon and arrested, but escaped to Brittany. There he joined the forces of the Lancastrian Earl of Richmond. Return He returned to England, with the Earl of Richmond, and commanded a troop at the Battle of Bosworth, on 22 August 1485, when King Richard III was killed and Richmond claimed the Throne as King Henry VII. William was richly rewarded for his loyalty. On 16 June 1487, he commanded the Royal Forces, including his son, Sir Edward Norreys, at the Battle of Stoke Field against Lambert Simnel. His son died shortly afterwards. He was Bailiff for Queen Elizabeth in 1488. He was reinstated as Justice of the Peace for Berkshire in 1494. He gave legal advice to the King in 1502, which brought him the appointment as custodian of the manor of Langley, and Steward of the manors of Burford, Shipton, Spelsbury and the Hundred of Chadlington (all in Oxfordshire). In 1504, he added the stewardships of Newbury and Stratfield Mortimer to his offices. He became Steward to the Chancellor of Oxford University in 1505. Marriages and issue In 1461 Norreys married Jane de Vere (d. before 1471), sister of 13th Earl of Oxford, by whom he had four sons and two daughters: *Sir Edward Norreys (c.1464 - 1487). *Richard Norreys (c.1465 - c.1522) of West Shefford, Berkshire. *William Norreys. *George Norreys. *Margaret Norreys, who married Gilbert Bullock, esquire, of Arborfield and Barkham, Berkshire. *Elizabeth Norreys (d. 22 January 1518), who married firstly Thomas Rogers, and secondly Thomas Fettiplace of Compton Beauchamp in Berkshire (c.1461-1523). On 25 April 1472, Norreys married Isabel Ingoldesthorpe, Marchioness of Montagu (1441 Cambridgeshire - 25 May 1476 buried: Bisham), daughter and co-heiress of Sir Edmund Ingoldesthorpe (1421‚Äì1456) and Joanna Tiptopf (1425‚Äì1494), and the widow of the 1st Marquess of Montagu, by whom she had two sons and five daughters. By his second wife Norreys had one son, who died an infant. Isabel Ingoldesthorpe died 20 May 1476, and was buried with her first husband at Bisham Priory. Norreys married thirdly, about 1478, Anne Horne, widow of Sir William Harcourt and Sir John Stanley (d. 29 June 1476), and daughter of Robert Horne, Alderman of London, by Joan, daughter of Edward Fabian. They had two sons and four daughters: *Richard Norreys. *Lionel Norreys (c. 1480 - 1537). *Katherine Norreys (born c. 1481), who married Sir John Langford of Aldworth in Berkshire. *Anne Norreys (born c. 1482), who married firstly William Wroughton, and secondly Sir John Baldwin, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas *Elizabeth Norreys (born c. 1484), who married William Fermor, esquire, of Somerton in Oxfordshire *Jane Norreys(born c. 1483), who married John Cheney of West Woodhay in Berkshire, by whom she was the mother of John Cheney MP As William Norreys's eldest son, Edward, had died in 1487, Edward's eldest son, John, inherited the family estates when his grandfather died about 10 January 1507.

It was built between 1928 and 1938 as the Foro Mussolini (literally Mussolini's Forum) under the design of Enrico Del Debbio and, later, Luigi Moretti. Inspired by the Roman forums of the imperial age, its design is lauded as a preeminent example of Italian fascist architecture instituted by Mussolini. The purpose of the prestigious project was to get the Olympic Games of 1940 to be organised by fascist Italy and held in Rome.  History  A phase of the transport of the Foro Italico monolith to the boarding place. The monolith was towed to Fiumicino on a pontoon, then it went up along the Tiber towed on the shore by oxen. It was the last major river transport in Rome. The first buildings of the architectural complex were inaugurated on November 4, 1932: they were Palazzo H, the seat of the Fascist School of Physical Education; the so-called \\"Monolith\\"; the Stadio dei Marmi; the Stadio dei Cipressi (then Stadio dei Centomila and now Stadio Olimpico). In 1936 and, subsequently, until 1941, Luigi Moretti - former author of the Accademia di scherma al Foro Italico in the Foro Mussolini - worked out designs that, while incorporating Del Debbio's urban plan, involved an expansion of the Foro towards Tor di Quinto; these designs were never put into practice. Description The main entrance of the Foro is south-east, in line with the ponte Duca d'Aosta: here - on a wide avenue entirely covered with a mosaic made of black and white tesserae - rises a huge obelisk 17,5 meters high (excluding the base), carved in Carrara marble, known as Stele Mussolini. The facility is decorated with statues, donated by the different Italian Provinces and therefore of different authors, which represent various sport activities: for example, the statue dedicated to javelin throw was donated by the Province of Perugia, while the one representing the so-called \\"ball with the bracelet\\" (an ancient Renaissance game) is due to the Province of Forl√¨-Cesena. Near the Stadio Olimpico rises the Palazzo della Farnesina, the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since 1959, designed by the architects who won the architectural design competition: Enrico Del Debbio, Arnaldo Foschini, Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo. The Foro is home to numerous sports venues, such as the largest sports facility in Rome, the Stadio Olimpico, the ornate Stadio dei Marmi and the adjoining building which is the seat of the Italian National Olympic Committee (originally built for the purposes of the Fascist Male Academy of Physical Education). Foro Italico also comprises an aquatics center built for the 1960 summer Olympics, the Stadio del Nuoto (\\"Swimming Stadium\\") and a tennis center. The tennis center is an extensive area with a total of eleven clay surface tennis courts, eight of which are used for tournaments and the rest for training purposes. There are currently three show or stadium courts: the main one formerly had a capacity of 8,000 spectators; however, a new center court, the Campo Centrale, which can seat up to 10,400 spectators, was constructed for the 2010 tournament. The other show courts are the Supertennis Arena and Stadio Pietrangeli (formerly Pallacorda, 3,500 seats\\"Prevendita\\". Internazionalibnlditalia.com. Retrieved 2012-06-02.). Foro Italico has hosted important events, most notably the 1960 Summer Olympics. The tennis center annually hosts the Italian Open (aka Rome Masters), an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and WTA Premier event. Since 2012, the Stadio Olimpico hosts the home games of the Italy national rugby union team at the Guinness Six Nations.

He was the brother or half brother to Demophon. Mythology After his father lost the throne of Athens, Acamas grew up an exile in Euboea. He and Diomedes were sent to negotiate the return of Helen before the start of the Trojan War,Parthenius of Nicaea, Erotica Pathemata 16 though Homer ascribes this embassy to Menelaus and Odysseus.Homer, Iliad 11.139 During his stay at Troy he caught the eye of Priam's daughter Laodice, and fathered her son Munitus. The boy was raised by Aethra, Acamas' grandmother, who was living in Troy as one of Helen's slaves.Tzetzes on Lycophron, Alexandra 495 Munitus later died of a snakebite while hunting at Olynthus in Thrace. In the war, Acamas fought on the side of the Greeks and was counted among the men inside the Trojan Horse.Hyginus, Fabulae 108 After the war, he rescued Aethra from her long captivity in Troy.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca Epitome of Book 4.5.22 Later mythological traditions describe the two brothers embarking on other adventures as well, including the capture of the Palladium. Some sources relate of Acamas the story which is more commonly told of his brother Demophon, namely the one of his relationship with Phyllis of Thrace. This might be a mistake. Acamas is not mentioned in Homer's Iliad, but later works, including Virgil's Aeneid,Virgil, Aeneid 2.262 and almost certainly the Iliou persis, mention that Acamas was one of the men inside the Trojan horse. The dominant character trait of Acamas is his interest in faraway places. Eponyms and Acamas in art The promontory of Acamas in Cyprus, the town of Acamentium in Phrygia, and the Attic tribe Acamantis all derived their names from him.Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica s.v.

On 1 August 2011, it merged with Orpington College, which became its Orpington campus. Built in 1972, Orpington College's tower block remains the tallest building in Orpington. Beginning in 2008, it underwent a ¬£26m overhaul. In November, a World War II air-raid shelter was discovered during construction work. This shelter would have housed Orpington residents from German bombing raids, and was buried when the Walnuts Shopping Centre was built. Buildings, dating back more than 30 years were demolished and a new hi-tech, eco-friendly four-storey block built, while the existing 10-storey block was refurbished. The new building houses a study and IT centre. The new library includes a quiet room and there is a new student common room. Following a competition held by the college, the new building was named \\"The Ozone\\" by winning student, Martin Baker.

Her parents were Freda Lust and Adolph Wertheimer from Nuremberg (N√ºrnberg) in Germany, who lived in London, Melbourne, Australia and again in London, when they changed their name to Winter (around 1910). Their children Rudolph, Rosa and Eleanora (Ella) were born in Melbourne. Fredric Wertham was a relative. She studied at the London School of Economics in England. She met the U.S. journalist and 'muckraker' Lincoln Steffens at the Versailles Conference, where she was secretary to US Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. Winter and Steffens married in 1924. They moved to Italy, where their son, Peter, was born in San Remo. Two years later, they moved to the largest art colony on the Pacific Coast, Carmel-by- the-Sea, California, where their friends and neighbors included photographer Edward Weston, poet Robinson Jeffers, philosopher/mythologist Joseph Campbell, nutritionist/author Adelle Davis, short story writer/poet Clark Ashton Smith, marine biologist/ecologist Ed Ricketts, Nobel prize winner Sinclair Lewis, and novelists John Steinbeck and Henry Miller. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). Carmel was sharply divided between conservative and liberal factions; the latter quickly coalesced around the Steffenses, who publicly debated the most controversial topics. The Irish poet and folklorist Ella Young, as well as the local press, described the relaxed social intercourse in this counterculture world.Carmel Pine Cone: 1 November 1935, p. 6; 14 February 1936, p.11. In 1928 the Steffenses helped to create The Carmelite, a publication that was offered as an alternative to the town‚Äôs somewhat stodgy local paper, the Carmel Pine Cone. With contributions by numerous leftist literati, including Jeffers, Martin Flavin, Lewis and the Steffenses, along with theatre, dance and art reviews by feminist artists such as Alberta Spratt, Jennie V. Cannon and Roberta Balfour, The Carmelite became one of California‚Äôs most controversial publications. Its illustrations ranged from Weston‚Äôs enigmatic photos to the ‚Äúanarchist‚Äù prints of James Blanding Sloan. The Steffenses also arranged for public exhibits of Europe‚Äôs most avant-garde art, including Dada, Surrealism and the paintings of Paul Klee. Ella wrote on various topics and once reported on the very unusual meeting between the popular Modernist artists John O‚ÄôShea and Frederick O‚ÄôBrien.The Carmelite, 3 April 1929, p. 3. The Steffenses' support of the art community extended to their own home where they entertained local painters and offered to display their work.Carmel Pine Cone, 19 April 1929, p. 14. Ella loved publicity and when two Carmel reactionaries, artist William Silva and writer/editor Perry Newberry, tried to ban the local chapter of her ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù John Reed Club as well as her ‚Äúsocialist reading room,‚Äù she made sure that the press as far away as Los Angeles was apprised of the violation of her civil rights.The Carmelite, 14 April 1932, p. 9.Los Angeles Times, 22 April 1932, p. I-2. The Steffenses also joined controversial national campaigns, including the Scottsboro Boys Defense Fund which sought to free nine black men who were still incarcerated after the Supreme Court of the United States twice reversed their convictions for rape.The San Francisco News, 24 February 1934, p. 11.Carmel Pine Cone, 23 February 1934, p. 5.The Oakland Tribune, 24 February 1934, p. 9. Lincoln Steffens died in Carmel in 1936. She wrote her first book, Red Virtue, after visiting the Soviet Union. Her autobiography, And Not to Yield, was published in 1963. In 1939, Winter married the screenwriter and humorist Donald Ogden Stewart and became stepmother to his sons, Donald and Ames.

Early life  Ashig Alasgar was born in 1821 in the village of Aghkilse in the Goycha region. His father Almammad worked as a carpenter. At the same time, he was also known as with his intelligence in literature. Almammad was fairly good at poetry genres such as Gerayly, Qoshma and Bayati. It is predicted that Almammad had a huge impact on Ashiq Alasgar. Ashiq Alasgar grew up in a big and poor family with three brothers and two sisters. He was the eldest son of the family. Due to the financial difficulties in his family, Alasgar was obliged to work on the farm of a rich landowner, Karbalayi Gurban when he was 14. While working here, Alasgar fell in love with 12 years old daughter of Karbalayi Gurban. But due to his social background, he was refused to have such a relationship with agha‚Äôs daughter and after some time Alasgar was fired. Ashig Alasgar spent his childhood in the village of Aghkilse and was uneducated. But despite this, he was able to learn the secrets of ashiq art from the elderly ashigs in his village. From his childhood, Alasgar was a careful listener and he was very passionately participated in most events in his village due to his strong memory and story-telling ability, he could manage to memorize almost all ashiq stories (dastans) of that time and. He was playing saz with using his left hand.  Activities  Ashiq Alasgar is considered one of the great representatives of Azerbaijani folk poetry. His poetries in Gerayly, Qoshma, Mukhammas, Cighali Tecnis, Giphilbend genres have influenced to ashigs of next generation after him. Ashig Alasgar was almost a master in branches of ashig art and contributed a lot to Azerbaijani literature. Alasgar wrote his first poetries in his adolescence period. Shortly after, his father encouraged him to learn ashig art from one of the famous ashigs in Goycha district, Ashig Ali. After a long term preparation, Alasgar had a chance to participate in a wedding ceremony in his village with Ashig Ali. In that event everyone appreciated the intelligence of Alasgar as he was able to defeat his instructor Ashiq Ali in a debate (kind of competition between two ashigs) and that event made Alasgar very famous in Goycha region and neighbouring districts. He actively participated in several wedding ceremonies important events in Iravan, Nakhchivan, Gazakh, Garabagh, Javanshir, Ganja, Kalbajar other regions.  Later life  Due to concussion from his first love, Alasgar did not marry anyone until he was 40 and then married a girl named Anakhanima from the village Yanshaq in Kalbajar district. In this period of time, Ashig Alasgar was busy with different activities in order to take care of his family. In spring and summertime, he was engaged in agriculture, small construction works and carpentry. But despite all of the above activities, he spent most of his time to the ashig art and wrote several poems. Alasgar was known not only in Azerbaijan but also as a master of ashig art in Turkey, Iran and Dagestan. Alasgar completed his later life in misery and suffering. In 1915, he lost his brother‚Äôs son and also his son-in-law in a very young age. After a year, his son Basir murdered the reeve of the village and could escape but instead, several people were arrested from Alasgar‚Äôs family. During the period of 1918-1919 conflict between Azerbaijanis and Armenians, Alasgar was forced to leave his motherland and migrated to live in Kalbajar and then to Tartar districts. In 1921, he returned to Aghkilse and resided here till the end of his life. Ashig Alasgar died in Aghkilse on March 7, 1926.

Two of his brothers were Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora and Alberto Ferrero la Marmora, the naturalist.  Bersaglieri  La Marmora was born in Turin in what was then the Kingdom of Sardinia. He had traveled in France, Britain, Bavaria, Saxony, Switzerland, and the Austrian county of Tyrol to study the armies and tactics of these countries and meticulously investigated the armaments and equipment of these foreign armies.Alessandro Ferrero della Marmora He demonstrated an early interest in military technology, and worked assiduously to improve the breechloading gun, for example. At his own house, he built a workshop to experiment with military technology. The first public appearance of the Bersaglieri was on the occasion of a military parade on 1 July 1836. The new corps impressed King Carlo Alberto, who immediately had them integrated as part of the Armata Sarda, the Piedmontese regular army. Throughout the nineteenth century, under La Marmora's leadership, the Bersaglieri filled the role of skirmishers, screening the slow-moving line and column formations, but acting as special shock troops if required. They were originally intended to serve as mountain troops, as well; the climber Jean Antoine Carrel was a Bersagliere. When the Alpini Corps were created in 1872 a strong rivalry arose between the two elite corps.  Military record  He participated in the Battle of Goito (1848) during the First Italian War of Independence and served as a division commander in the Crimean War.  Death  He died at Balaklava from cholera shortly after disembarking there during the Crimean War. A memorial bust was erected outside among the statues and monuments of patriots on the Janiculum hill in Rome.

It is an annual plant that grows from 10 to 30 cm tall. The obovate to spathulate leaves form a basal rosettes around the stem. The leaves are around 4‚Äì6 mm long. Inflorescences are unbranched racemes and produce flowers that are violet with white at the base and bloom from June to August in their native range. S. longicornu is endemic to the Kimberley region in Western Australia. Its habitat is recorded as being sand flats near sandstone.

S. longicornu was first described by Sherwin Carlquist in 1979, but he noted that characteristics of this species have been recorded before. The description of S. ceratophorum given by Rica Erickson in 1958 noted that the corolla colour is either orange or mauve with a white throat. All other descriptions and observations of S. ceratophorum have only included colours such as golden-yellow (from dried specimens) or orange in their descriptions of flower colour, indicating that Erickson may have also seen S. longicornu in the field, however this would represent a range expansion beyond where Carlquist had observed it, which he postulated was possible.

Early life  Olson was born in Darien, Connecticut. She attended public school in Darien and graduated from Lasell College in Auburndale, Massachusetts, where she studied Business Administration.  Marketing career  After college, Olson spent seven years in marketing, the last three at Warner-Lambert in Morris Plains, New Jersey. She developed promotional campaigns for consumer products such as Schick razors, Listermint mouthwash, and Lubriderm lotion. Engaging the homeless Rushing by Grand Central Station in Manhattan to a business meeting in 1982, Olson noticed a homeless woman she'd passed before. This time, she decided impulsively to buy a sandwich for the woman. When she gave it to her, the woman began a conversation. According to Olsen, \\"I learned a little bit about her life, and a barrier was sort of broken,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄùUp until that point, I had thought you just don‚Äôt go near homeless people.\\" Olson and her two young sons began frequent trips to New York to hand out sandwiches to the homeless. ‚ÄúFor a couple of years,‚Äù Olson said, ‚Äúevery other Sunday, we would go in armed with sandwiches and got to know (homeless) people by name.‚Äù[1]  National Interfaith Hospitality Network/Family Promise  When Olson learned there were hundreds of homeless people, including families, in her home community of Union County, New Jersey, she turned to the religious community for help. Within ten months, eleven area congregations were providing hospitality space within their buildings. The local YMCA was providing showers and a day center for families. A car dealer discounted a van for the organization to purchase. On October 27, 1986, the first Interfaith Hospitality Network opened its doors. As word spread, ten more congregations formed a second Network. Programs for transitional housing, childcare, and financial literacy followed.[2] Olson began an initiative to persuade religious communities across the country to provide homeless families with shelter, meals and help. The success of the first Networks led other congregations to seek help in developing similar programs. In 1988 it became a national nonprofit organization, the National Interfaith Hospitality Network. In 2003, its name changed to Family Promise.[3][4] Olson retired from leadership of Family Promise in January 2016, remaining as president emeritus. She continued to meet with affiliate leadership nationally and volunteers locally with the Union County program. She also gives talks about homelessness, poverty, and affordable housing at Family Promise locations, universities, schools, corporations, and businesses. Olson is currently writing a book about Family Promise, volunteerism, and homelessness. She has spoken at the Clinton School of Public Service[8) at the University of Arkansas on Mobilizing Communities to End Homelessness and the University of Kansas.[9] According to Olson, \\"It's up to each one of us to develop a public will to make a difference and to solve this tragedy of homelessness.\\"  Awards, works and recognitions  Olson received the 1992 Annual Points of Light Award from President George H.W. Bush, the New Jersey Governor's Pride Award in Social Services, and the Jefferson Award from the American Institute for Public Service. She has been profiled by CBS News,[5] published in The Huffington Post,[6] and she is featured in the book Courage is Contagious: Ordinary People Doing Extraordinary Things to Change the Face of America, written in 1999 by Ohio Congressman John Kasich. Olson served on the Family Homelessness Task Force of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the New Jersey Interagency Council on Homelessness[7].

Downhill moutainbiker Markus St√∂ckl sets new world speed record In 2017 he set a new world record in the Atacama region of Chile with a speed of 167.6 km/h. He weighs 100 kg, stands 1.90 meters tall and his nickname is Hercules. He is currently director of the MS Racing team.http://www.ms-racing.at Biography Markus started biking in year 1992. In year 1999 he could not afford an expensive bicycle prototype, so he rode in the series bike class and managed to set a world speed record in that category, descending at 187 km/h at Les Arcs. On September 14, 2007, at the age of 33, St√∂ckl rode his Intense M6 mountainbike down the ski slope of La Parva, Chile. The slope is 1,6 kilometers long with a decline of 45 degrees. He reached the speed of 210,4 km/h, 23 km/h faster than his own old record from eight years earlier. The new record was attained on a conventional bicycle with Shimano components, including a Saint crankset and rear d√©railleur and the new Deore XT disc brakes with 203mm rotors that gave him the controllability and brake power to stop safely after each attempt. A lot of preparations went into the record attempt, but still some difficulties were met. South America‚Äôs springtime weather had melted away much of the snow alongside the piste, shrinking it to a narrow strip set up between bare mountain cliffs which made the test runs difficult to carry out. His aerodynamic helmet fogged up while practicing, so St√∂ckl decided to hold his breath during his 40 seconds lasting record attempt. The top descending speeds have always been obtained on snow. Apart from that, the ashes and gravel of a volcano have been the other surface used. In 2011 St√∂ckl did break the world speed record descending on gravel, on a serial production bicycle, reaching 164,95 km/h on the Cerro Negro volcano in Nicaragua, beating the previous record of 163 km/h reached by Eric Barone in 2002. St√∂ckl has declared that he wishes to break the speed record for prototype bicycles, which is set at 222 km/h on snow, and at 172 km/h on gravel, by Eric Barone.

Historic sites The town's historic sites include the central Romanesque-Gothic Cathedral of St Mark (built from 1301 to 1806), the 15th-century Franciscan monastery with a Venetian Gothic cloister, the civic council chambers, the palace of the former Venetian governors, grand 15th- and 16th-century palaces of the local merchant nobles, and the massive city fortifications. Cursola, as it was called in Latin, became an episcopal see in the early 14th century, when the bishop of Ston (Stagnum in Latin) asked to be authorized to transfer his seat there because of Serb pressure on Ston. This was granted and he was made bishop also of a new diocese of Cursola united with his previous one. In 1541, the Ragusans asked for the separation of ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Ston, which they had conquered, from Cursola, which in the previous century had become a Venetian possession. In 1828, when both the Korƒçula and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) belonged to the Austrian Empire, the territory of the diocese of Cursola was made part of that of Dubrovnik.Curzola, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques, vol.

He won a silver medal in the high jump at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. He later served as general secretary of the Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division) from 1978 to 1987. Early Life Porter was born in Brisbane, the son of Charles Robert Porter who was a Queensland state Liberal MP between 1966 and 1980 and served in the ministry of Joh Bjelke-Petersen. He was educated at the Anglican Church Grammar School.  Athletics  Porter was a high jumper who utilized the straddle technique, the dominant high jump technique before the Fosbury Flop emerged in the 1960s. At the age of 19, Porter competed for Australia in the high jump at the 1956 Summer Olympics held in Melbourne, Australia, finishing second and taking the silver medal with a leap height of 2.10m, more than 5cm higher than his previous personal best. American Charles Dumas won the gold medal, setting an Olympic record of 2.12m, higher than the previous Olympic best by 7 cm. The event was known for lasting more than five hours and continuing well into dusk in front of 60,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and was the longest field event in Olympic history. The Australian media heavily covered the event, including the television station GTV9, which had just recently begun transmitting. He also won silver medals in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games held in Cardiff, UK, with a height 2.03m, and in the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia with a height of 2.08m. Between 1955 and 1961, he won seven straight Australian high jump titles and held the national record for six years. He was the first Australian high jump athlete to clear the height of 2.10m.  Post- athletics career  Porter moved to Perth in the early 1960s where he married Nerida Chater. He worked for the Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division) as a divisional field officer in the seats of Fremantle, Perth and Stirling. He subsequently became a senior field officer and then was appointed general secretary (equivalent to the modern position of state director) in 1978. After a series of electoral defeats he resigned in April 1987 and worked as director of a marketing agency. Porter returned to the Liberal Party as chair of the state campaign committee from 1994 to 1996.'Remembering Chilla Porter', Liberal Party memorial notice, 17 August 2020, prepared by Jeremy Buxton. Porter was appointed chairman of the Western Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS) in 1995 by the state Liberal government. He held the position only until 1996 but was \\"instrumental in WAIS developing a new purpose-built facility at Challenge Stadium\\". Over the same period, Porter was director of Controlled Marketing, a fundraising firm that managed fundraising for several charities in Western Australia, as well as fundraising for the Liberal Party. The company was criticized for the amount of money that was distributed to the charities after fundraising costs were deducted. In addition to fundraising, Controlled Marketing was also involved in pre- election push polling. Porter was inducted into the Athletics Australia Hall of Fame in 2011. Personal life Porter died on 15 August 2020, after a long battle with cancer. He was 84. His son Christian Porter is the Liberal member for Pearce in Western Australia in the Australian House of Representatives, as well as the Attorney-General of Australia.

Half-Caste Act was the common name given to Acts of Parliament passed in Victoria (Half-Caste Act 1886) and Western Australia (Aborigines Protection Act 1886) in 1886. They became the model for legislation to control Aboriginal people throughout Australia, such as the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 in Queensland.Kenneth Liberman. The Decline of the Kuwarra People of Australia's Western Desert: A Case Study of Legally Secured Domination. Ethnohistory, Vol. 27, No. 2. (Spring, 1980), pp. 119-133. See page 121 in particular. The Acts allowed the seizure of \\"half-caste\\" children (i.e., mixed race childrenMemidex/WordNet) and their forcible removal from their parents. This was theoretically to provide them with better homes than those afforded by typical Aboriginal people, where they could grow up to work as domestic servants, and also for social engineering. \\"Half-caste\\" people were distinguished from \\"full-blood\\" Aboriginal people. The removed children are now known as Stolen Generations. Victoria The Victorian Half-Caste Act 1886 (in full, an Act to amend an Act entitled \\"An Act to Provide for the Protection and Management of the Aboriginal Natives of Victoria\\") was an extension and expansion of the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 which gave extensive powers over the lives of Aboriginal people in the colony of Victoria to the Board for the Protection of Aborigines, including regulation of residence, employment and marriage. In particular, the 1886 Act started to remove Aboriginal people of mixed descent, known as \\"half-castes\\", from the Aboriginal reserves to force them to assimilate into European society. These expulsions separated families and communities, causing distress and leading to protest. Nevertheless, the Board refused to assist the expelled people. It was assumed that the expulsions would lead to the decline in the population of the reserves and their eventual closure. The failure of this policy and its inhumanity led to Victoria's Aborigines Act 1910 and Aboriginal Lands Act 1970, which abandoned this policy. Western Australia Gov. Broome (seated centre) and the last Executive Council before responsible government in Western Australia, c.1890. The Western Australian Aboriginal Protection Board was established in 1886, with five members and a secretary, all of whom were nominated by the Governor, by the Aborigines Protection Act 1886 (WA), or Half-Caste Act. The 1886 Act was enacted following the furore over the Fairbairn Report of 1882, which revealed slavery conditions among Aboriginal farm workers, and the work of Rev. John Gribble. The 1886 Act introduced employment contracts between employers and Aboriginal workers over the age of 14. There was no provision in the 1886 Act for contracts to include wages, but employees were to be provided with \\"substantial, good and sufficient rations\\", clothing and blankets. The 1886 Act provided a resident magistrate with the power to indenture 'half-caste' and Aboriginal children from a suitable age until they turned 21. An Aboriginal Protection Board, was also established to prevent the abuses reported earlier, but rather than protect Aborigines, it succeeded mainly in putting them under tighter government control. It was intended to enforce contracts, employment of prisoners and apprenticeships, but there was not sufficient power to enforce clauses in the north, and they were openly flouted. The Act defined as \\"Aboriginal\\" \\"every Aboriginal native of Australia, every Aboriginal half-caste, or child of a half-caste\\". Governor Frederick Broome insisted that the act contain within it a clause permitting traditional owners to continue hunting on their tribal lands. The effect of the Act was to give increasing power to the Board over Aboriginal people, rather than setting up a system to punish whites for wrongdoing in relation to Aboriginal people. An Aboriginal Department was set up under the office of the Chief Protector of Aborigines. Nearly half of the Legislative Council voted to amend the Act for contract labour as low as 10, but it was defeated. McKenzie Grant, the member for The North, claimed that child labour of 6 or 7 was a necessary commonplace, as \\"in this way they gradually become domesticated\\". The Attorney General Septimus Burt, in debate on the second-reading speech, claimed that contracts were being issued not for current work but to hold Aboriginal people as slaves on stations for potential future work to prevent them from being free to leave. Aboriginal Protection Boards Protectors of Aborigines were appointed by the Board under the conditions laid down in the various Acts. In theory, Protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal people, dictate where Aboriginal people could live or work, and keep all wages earned by employed Aboriginal people. As the Boards had limited funds, Protectors received very limited remuneration and so a range of people were appointed as local Protectors, including resident magistrates, jail wardens, Justices of the Peace and in some cases ministers of religion, but most were local police inspectors. The minutes of the Board show that they dealt with mostly matters of requests from religious bodies for financial relief and reports from Resident or Police Magistrates pertaining to trials and convictions of Aboriginal people under their jurisdiction. Aboriginal Protection Boards also issued permits to allow Aboriginal people the right to leave their respective missions and enter mainstream society for a set period of time.

Early life Born Nicholas Michael Anthony Zala, he was exposed to music from a very young age. His grandparents were both skilled pianists - one a sight reader, and the other a jazz musician who played entirely by ear. He took up the cello at the age of seven but gave it up only two years later in favour of the more portable guitar. By the age of 15, he had received jazz guitar tuition from Ike Isaacs and some useful advice in a one-to-one with Joe Pass. Career After 30 years as a professional guitar-player and teacher, Zala took up the pedal steel guitar. His first band, The Loose Salute, contacted him eight weeks after he had bought his pedal steel. A positive review of his first gig with The Loose Salute appeared in The Guardian, boosting his career. Between 2003 and 2007, he recorded on eleven albums, toured in Europe and the United States, appeared on television and radio, and made it into the top ten of the UK Albums Chart, with pop band McFly's platinum-selling album Motion In The Ocean. Numerous albums have subsequently followed, both in the retail and production music areas, and likewise many sessions, both on guitar, pedal steel and other instruments, including banjo, mandolin, ukulele and harmonica. His latest title Jazz Guitar described by him as \\"a homage to Ike (Isaacs), and Joe (Pass), and a fresh look at the genre\\". In 2012, Zala played guitar and pedal steel in \\"Acetones\\" with Alan Darby (guitar), Jim Watson (keyboards), and Jonathan Noyce (bass). Zala has been working with composer Chris Bangs on the feature film, Highly Functional set for U.S. release in September 2016 (pedal steel, guitar, mandolin).

Ocean Blvd. on Hutchinson Island in Stuart, Florida, United States, focuses on art, history, and technology. Named after the prolific inventor Sterling Elliott, the museum features a changing exhibition gallery and an art studio; maritime, baseball, and local history galleries; and bicycles, classic wooden boats, motorcycles, over 90 cars and trucks, and even an airplane. Over 50 vehicles are displayed in a unique robotic racking system which retrieves vehicles on demand for display on a turntable. The Elliott Museum has one of the largest collections of historic Ford Model A and Model AA commercial vehicles in the world. History Original museum building, November 2010 The original Elliott Museum was built in 1961 by Harmon Elliott as a tribute to his father, Sterling Elliott. On November 18, 1961, it was given to the non-profit Historical Society of Martin County, which has operated both the Museum and Gilbert‚Äôs Bar House of Refuge ever since. Some of the collection came from Sterling Elliott. Much of it was purchased by Harmon Elliott from an Americana Museum in Salem, Massachusetts for display in the Elliott Museum. Over the years, the original building was in need of repair and the spaces no longer met the needs of the growing museum organization, so in June 2011 the original Elliott Museum building was torn down. The new, 48,000 square foot Elliott Museum opened to the public in March, 2013. The Museum opened with the donation of the Model A and Model AA commercial vehicle collection assembled by Elliott R. Donnelley. Shortly after opening, the Museum merged with the Classic Boat and Maritime Museum, taking on its collection of classic boats, boat models, and its mission of interpreting local maritime history. The new Elliott Museum offers permanent and changing exhibitions, and the Museum hosts a number of programs and lectures throughout the course of the year. The Museum attracts a number of vintage car enthusiasts, and its annual car show Classics at the Beach has been held each Spring since 1996.

Budgie, drummer and composer in the two bands, was the musical director on this tour; he re- orchestred the songs with Siouxsie. As said in the interviews present in the bonus of the DVD, this concert represents a musical achievement for Siouxsie and Budgie as they had always wanted to perform on stage with Leonard Eto, a Japanese Taiko drummer previously of the Kodo Drummers. Siouxsie added that this show was a dream come true as they also played with a fifteen piece orchestra including two percussionists, a brass section and a string section.

They have produced the wildlife film Wild Dog Diaries for National Geographic Channel. For this documentary they won the following awards: * Festival de l'Oiseau et de la Nature 2008 (Abbeville, France) ‚Äì Best Nature Documentary Award * Japan Wildlife Film Festival 2007 (Toyama, Japan) ‚Äì Best of Festival Grand Award * CMS Vatavaran Environment and Wildlife Film Festival 2007 (New Delhi, India) ‚Äì Best of Festival Award and Best Story Award * Asian Television Awards 2007 (Singapore) ‚Äì Best Natural History and Wildlife Programme * Wildscreen 2006 (Bristol, UK) ‚Äì nominated for Panda Award * NaturVision 2006 (Neuschoenau, Germany) ‚Äì nominated for Best International Film. The film was also aired by ARTE in France and Germany. Presently, they are producing a film on wild dogs for Discovery Channel. Krupakar studied business administration at D Banumaiah's College in Mysore where he played cricket for Mysore University. He also worked as a journalist in Mangalore and later in Bangalore before taking up photography professionally with Senani Hegde. Senani Hegde is a graduate in civil engineering from Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering in Mysore. He gave up a lucrative construction business to pursue wildlife photography with Krupakar. Together they wrote photo essays for popular magazines. In the beginning, they studied small birds in Mandya district, capturing the life of capricious birds and recorded their adaptation to changing habitat. Simultaneously, they wrote popular articles on these birds recording their experiences and weaving sociological aspects. Later they moved to Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu. Their book 'Jeeva Jaala', co- authored with K. Puttaswamy, won the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award 1999 for science writing. They received Karnataka Rajyothsava Award in 2006, the state's highest award, from the Government of Karnataka, for their overall contribution to the field of photography. Their pictures have been published in international magazines such as GEO, The Times, People, BBC Wildlife, Nature. Oxford Scientific Films, UK, market their photographs. Krupakar and Senani, along with the then forest officer D Yathish Kumar, have been instrumental in the formation and functioning of Namma Sangha, a conservation effort on the fringes of Bandipur National Park in south India. The society has been very successful in reducing the pressure of removal of fuelwood from the forest, by introducing cooking gas in the villages around the park. The society's network includes 194 villages, and so far 29,000 families are using cooking gas. The uniqueness of this project was funded entirely by friends and well-wishers, without any foreign and government assistance. The project is now self-sustained, and has become a model for other such endeavours. In October 2010, Krupakar and Senani won the prestigious Green Oscar award for their film on dhole The Pack in the prestigious Wildscreen film festival held at Bristol, UK. \\"The Pack\\" was produced and directed in the dense forests of Nilgiris for over a decade and unfolds the lifestyle of dhole. It was the first film produced and directed in Asia to be nominated for this award and competed against David Attenborough's Life Stories and another film by the National Geographic channel. Krupakar and Senani received the honours from noted scientist George Schaller.

Dominant first deployed to Europe soon after arriving at Charleston (4 January - 11 June 1956) and followed that a Mediterranean deployment the next year (1 May - 2 October 1957), a northern European deployment that included a cruise to Danish and German ports in the Baltic Sea (12 May - 30 September 1958), another Mediterranean deployment (27 April - 27 August 1959) before returning to her new home port at Little Creek, Virginia.  Providing services for BUSHIPS  After her shift to the Norfolk, Virginia, area, Dominant reported to Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force, to provide towing, recovery and other services for Bureau of Ships projects. These duties were again interspersed with deployments, including the West Indies (23 January - 4 May 1961, 30 October 1961 - 17 January 1962, 17 June - 25 September 1964, 4 October - 16 December 1965), the Mediterranean. Cuban Missel Crisis - 22‚Äì26 October 1962, While attached to MINDIV 43 the Dominant, along with Dash, Direct and Detector were assigned to the Caribbean to Patrol the Windward Passage in search and boarding of Russian Ships - 12 February 1963; 7 February - 16 July 1965) as well as amphibious and other fleet operations off South Carolina. The minesweeper also provided contingency services for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) off Bermuda in April 1963. Dominant continued the same pattern of activities through the end of the decade, with one more Mediterranean deployment (3 November 1966 - 14 May 1967), an exercise with Colombian and Venezuelan naval forces (9 May - 10 June 1968), an additional NATO exercise off Halifax, Nova Scotia (Exercise Silver Tower 9‚Äì27 September 1968) and an extensive modernization period at the Old Dominion Shipyard at Norfolk starting in early 1969. Following her refit, Dominant was homeported in Charleston SC along with her entire squadron (the other \\"D\\" ships) From there, they departed for another European cruise. Port hopping via Halifax Nova Scotia and St.Johns Newfoundland for topping off, she and her squadron sailed unescorted to Campbelltown Scotland. She carried insufficient fuel in her tanks for the crossing so a 2,500 gallon fuel bladder was installed on her fantail. The squadron made it with fuel to spare. This was reported to have made US Naval history; an MSO crossing the Atlantic unescorted. The cruise continued to Denmark where the squadron was engaged in Operation Love Song, a NATO exercise and then on to Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Spain and into the Mediterranean. They continued in the Med for several months with a maintenance stop in Naples. The squadron recrossed the Atlantic, sailing from the Straits of Gibraltar to Charleston in company with a destroyer tender which had completed her assignment in Naples. Dominant and the \\"D\\" squadron arrived in Charleston in early spring of 1971 and was rumored to be taken out of service soon.  Assigned as Naval Reserve training ship  After the minesweeper shifted to the newly reorganized Mine Division 23 in April 1971, Dominant changed status again to become a U.S. Naval Reserve Training (NRT) ship on 1 July 1971, joining Mine Squadron 12 with three other minesweepers that same day. Her designation was later changed to a Naval Reserve Force (NRF) ship. The minesweeper also changed home port to St. Petersburg, Florida, on 20 August and began training her complement of reserve crews one weekend a month and for two-weeks of annual training. Although reserve training duties generally kept the minesweeper in Florida waters, Dominant occasionally sailed to South Carolina or Virginia for overhaul or for minesweeping exercises and periodically conducted search and rescue sweeps for crashed aircraft or lost helicopters.  Home port shift to Perth Amboy  On 1 July 1977 Dominant shifted home port again to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where her crew conducted a cross-deck transfer with minesweeper . The minesweeper operated out of Perth Amboy for the next five years, training local reserve crews and periodically conducting exercises up and down the east coast (ranging from Rhode Island to South Carolina). During one cruise in June 1979, Dominant assisted stricken yacht That Boat south of Shinnecock Inlet, Long Island, providing aid to the sinking vessel until the U.S. Coast Guard arrived on the scene.  Encounter with a Cuban gunboat  Her next significant deployment took place in early June 1980, when the minesweeper sailed to the Straits of Florida, whose waters were flooded with Cuban refugees. During her week-long stay (5‚Äì11 June) Dominant rescued refugees from several over-crowded and sinking small craft. At one point the minesweeper was challenged by a Cuban gunboat, which demanded the return of a specific refugee, but Dominant refused the demand.  Decommissioning  The minesweeper made one more West Indies deployment (2 June - 20 July) before commencing deactivation procedures. Dominant decommissioned at Charleston on 1 October 1982 and was struck from the Navy List that same day. She was then sold for scrap to Wayne Hobbs of Huntington Beach, California, on 7 December 1983.

It was his debut novel. It is the first book in a series focusing on private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. Plot introduction Private Investigators Kenzie and Gennaro are tasked to retrieve missing documents by a trio of politicians. The trail leads them into the midst of a gang war and reveals an act of child abuse. Kenzie struggles with memories of his own past while Gennaro deals with her abusive marriage. Plot summary Boston private detectives Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro receive a job from three state politicians, Sterling Mulkern, Jim Vurnan and Brian Paulson, to recover documents from a former cleaning lady, Jenna Angeline. Tracking Angeline to her sister's house outside Boston, they learn she has hidden the documents in a safe deposit box in a bank back in the city. Kenzie escorts Angeline to the bank, where she gives him one photo before being gunned down by Curtis Moore, a street enforcer for notorious gangster and pimp Marion Socia. The photo shows Socia with Paulson, who has stripped down to his socks and underwear. Angeline had only hidden one photo in the safe deposit box, and it is up to Kenzie and Gennaro to find the rest. The ensuing investigation takes the detectives from swanky Boston hotels to housing projects in the poorest ghettos of Dorchester. Kenzie wrestles with problems of race, class, urban violence, corruption, abuse, and love. A gang war erupts between Socia and his son Roland, who has taken his own gang independent, culminating in the bloodiest night of gang violence in Boston history. A street terrorism bill that would have curbed the violence is suspiciously stalled before coming to a vote. All these events are connected to the photographs, and as they pursue the evidence, Kenzie and Gennaro find themselves hunted by both sides. Eventually the detectives find the photos, and learn that Socia prostituted his young son with Angeline, Roland, to Paulson years ago, ironically leading the boy to become a stone-cold killer. Roland gains the upper hand in the war, and Socia demands the pictures back, hoping to blackmail Roland and save himself. At a meeting with Socia, Kenzie loses control and kills him. Releasing a photo to the press with Roland's face obscured so that he will not lose his street cred and grip on his gang, Paulson is disgraced, and a victorious Roland agrees not to come after Kenzie and Gennaro.

Major themes Themes of the novel include racial and class warfare and the effect of blue collar bitterness in father figures. Literary significance and reception The New York Times described the book as somewhat clich√©d but praised the honest approach to racial and class warfare. They also felt that the seriousness of the novel's themes made a jarring contrast with the flippancy of the detective characters. Explanation of the title The title refers to the gang war that is central to the plot. It is from a line spoken by the character Devin midway through the novel. Awards and nominations Dennis Lehane received a Shamus Award for best first detective novel for the book.

PlayFirst produced the Diner Dash series, which won the 2008 Annual Casual Game Awards. and has seen over 550 million downloads. The popularity of Diner Dash series prompted spin-off series like Wedding Dash and Cooking Dash. The company‚Äôs game portfolio also includes the retro-style strategy-based Chocolatier series, and the adventure/hidden object-mixing Dream Chronicles series. From 2005 to mid-2011, PlayFirst have released 72 casual games for PC and Mac, counting extra 7 Collector's Editions and Strategy Guides, thus they have 79 games in total in their game categories.  History = 2005‚Äì2010: Early days, breakthrough, and maintaining the success of Dash series  PlayFirst‚Äôs biggest commercial success is one of its earliest released games, Diner Dash series, which was released for the first time on PC/Mac platforms in 2005. Diner Dash was initially developed by Gamelab, a New York-based casual game developer, and after foreseeing its huge potential, PlayFirst bought the rights to the game. The success of Diner Dash with game critics and gamers prompted PlayFirst to release four sequels in the following years: Restaurant Rescue (2006), Flo on the Go (2006), Hometown Hero (2007), and the fifth BOOM! in 2010. PlayFirst has also published Diner Dash across multiple platforms, including PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Facebook and consoles DS, Xbox, and Wii. PlayFirst games are available on more than 500 sites in 20 languages. Spin-off series and games Wedding Dash (2007), Cooking Dash (2008), and Hotel Dash (2009) were released. However, they mostly earned lukewarm receptions from game critics and gamers. Other non-Dash PlayFirst games includes the three-part, retro-style strategy-based Chocolatier series, which was released during 2007 and 2009 in collaboration with Big Splash Games. The five-part, adventure/hidden object-mixing Dream Chronicles series was another highlight in PlayFirst's portfolio. Dream Chronicles was released during 2007 and 2011 in collaboration with KatGames.  2010‚Äì2015: Cancellation of releasing on PC/Mac and new direction  In October 2010, PlayFirst announced a focus on the mobile and social market after raising $9.2 million from investors, and cancelled releasing further casual games in the near future. PlayFirst's forays into the social gaming market have proven unsuccessful, as low user counts forced the company to cancel all of its Facebook games, Diner Dash and Chocolatier, not long after launching them. As of late 2010, the company employed more than 100 workers, but laid off an unspecified number of its employees in early December 2011 due to \\"restructuring\\". Other social games veterans who joined the company in late 2010 from Playdom and Zynga have also left; however, PlayFirst claims the layoffs will not change its emphasis on the mobile market. On October 8, 2012, PlayFirst emailed its subscribers informing them that the company will cease the production of PC and Mac games and move to a new website since November 12, 2012. The email read, \\"We have established a firm position as one of the leading producers for iOS mobile applications and are currently working on implementing our games into the Android marketplace,\\" and that current games in its catalogue will still be available for purchase on the third party websites like Big Fish Games and GameHouse.

Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, Arkham House, 1976, p. 40 It was first published in hardcover by Morris' Kelmscott Press in 1895.Eugene D. LeMire, A Bibliography of William Morris, New Castle, Del., Oak Knoll Press, 2006, pp. 198-199 Its importance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized by its republication by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the twelfth volume of the celebrated Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library in April, 1977. Plot summary Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair, set in the forested land of Oakenrealm, was Morris' reimagining and recasting of the medieval Lay of Havelock the Dane, with his displaced royal heirs Christopher and Goldilind standing in for the original story's Havelock and Goldborough. In contrast to his source, Morris emphasizes the romantic aspect of the story, giving a prominent place to the heroine's misfortunes and bringing to the forefront the love story between her and the hero; the warfare by which the hero regains his heritage is relegated to a secondary role. Also unlike both the source and most of Morris's other fantasies, there is little or no supernatural element in this version of the story. Christopher is portrayed as initially ignorant of his true identity, leading to an emotional conflict between the protagonists to reconcile their mutual love and attraction with what they believe to be the profound disparity in their social status and shame of their forced marriage. This situation is resolved when the two fall in with Jack of the Tofts, who gives refuge to Christopher after his sons rescue the hero from an assassination attempt by a servant of the usurper Earl Rolf. Jack informs Christopher of his true station and gathers together an army to help him challenge the usurper. When the hosts meet, the commander of Rolf's forces, Baron Gandolf of Brimside, challenges Jack to single combat, but Christopher claims the honor from Jack and proves his worth by defeating the opposing champion. Influence Morris' novels were particularly influential among the Inklings. According to critic Robert Boenig, the novel was an important influence on C. S. Lewis's children's story Prince Caspian.Robert Boenig, \\"Prince Caspian and Child Christopher and Goldilind the Fair,\\" in Mythlore, no. 97/98, spring/summer 2007.

Vilei≈°is was a prominent Lithuanian engineer, political activist, publisher, and philanthropist who commissioned the palace in 1904 and supervised its construction. The ensemble consists of a main house, a guesthouse, and an outbuilding. It currently houses the Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore. It was renovated during the early 2000s. History Petras Vilei≈°is The palace's architect, August Klein, created two blueprints, one Neo-classical and the other Neo-baroque. Vilei≈°is selected the Neo-baroque style, because of the site's proximity to the baroque St. Peter and St. Paul's Church. Work on the ensemble began in 1904. According to witnesses, the lime used in its construction was diluted with separated milk rather than water. Some materials not customarily used at the time were employed, such as ferroconcrete. Building materials were bought from Finland and the Netherlands. The project was completed in 1906. It was situated on a one-half hectare site, surrounded by a wrought iron fence and elaborately landscaped. The main palace has two floors. Petras Vilei≈°is' office and an ante-room were located on the first floor, as were a hallway, two drawing rooms and a dining room. The large chandelier in the vestibule was a gift from the workers at the Vilija factory. A terrace between the first and second floors was surrounded by a balustrade. The family's bedrooms were located on the second floor, while servants' quarters were located in the attic under the mansard roof. The interior was decorated in Neo-classical and Rococo styles, featuring crown molding, sculptural elements, and pastel tiles. Portraits, busts, and bas-reliefs of Lithuanian literary and cultural figures were displayed throughout the palace. Left facade of the palace The ensemble's guesthouse is three stories tall, with two stairways. Vilei≈°is established a printing press for the Vilniaus ≈æinios, the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper printed in Vilnius, in the basement. The newspaper's editorial and administrative offices were on the first floor; other offices were located on its second floor. On 1907 January 9, the first Lithuanian Art Exhibition was held at the guesthouse, presenting the artwork of Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis and Antanas ≈Ωmuidzinaviƒçius. It was the first exhibition of ƒåiurlionis' paintings. The ensemble's outbuilding, constructed in yellow brick, is two stories tall. This building was used as a book bindery and as living quarters for servants. Petras Vilei≈°is and his family lived in the palace until World War I. In 1926, Vilei≈°is died and the palace was inherited by his daughter, Elena Vilei≈°ytƒó. In 1931, she sold the entire ensemble to the Lithuanian organization Rytas for 55,000 US dollars. From 1941 to 1990 the palace housed the Lithuanian literature and Lithuanian language institutes. Since 1990, it has housed the Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore.  The Palace today Palace from the side edge The palace underwent three years of renovation in the early 2000s and was re-opened in 2007. Since it was structurally sound, its restoration was largely cosmetic. During the renovation, many significant historic documents were found hidden in the palace walls. However, the long-missing copies of the Act of Independence of Lithuania, signed in 1918, were not found, despite a popular belief that they were hidden in the palace. Petras Vilei≈°is' brother, Jonas Vilei≈°is, was one of the Act's signatories.

Moorgate in 1650 It appears that the area outside, the once very marshy Lower and Little Moorfields (now mostly occupied by Finsbury Circus and the surrounding buildings), previously part of the Soke of Cripplegate and then the Manor of Finsbury, was added in the 17th century,The Ward did not extend beyond the wall at the time of John Stows survey of 1603 ‚Äì but it did by the time of Ogilby and Morgans map of 1676 though it was not developed until 1817. The Walbrook, known at this point as Deepditch and running on the line of modern Blomfield Street, formed the eastern boundary of Lower Moorfields and the line continues to form the eastern boundary of the part of the ward lying north of the former wall,BHO source on the Moorfields area https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey- london/vol8/pp88-90 with the extra-mural ward of Bishopsgate Without lying east of the brook, and the road which now covers it.

Brennan began his professional career in 1908 with the Springfield Midgets. He played in 1909 with the Wichita Jobbers, and had a win-loss record of 18-16 with them that season. After the season, the Cincinnati Reds purchased his contract without having seen him pitch. The Philadelphia Phillies traded for him in January 1910 due to finding this out, acquiring Brennan and Bob Ewing for Harry Coveleski and Frank Corridon. Brennan made his major league debut on May 19, 1910, and played in 19 games his rookie season, finishing the year with a 2-0 record and a 2.33 earned run average (ERA). The following season, he split the season between the Phillies and the Buffalo Bisons. In 1912, he rejoined the Phillies' major league roster full-time, and pitched for them until a late-July bout of Diphtheria sidelined him for the rest of the season. In 27 games he had an 11-9 record and a 3.57 ERA. The following season, Brennan pitched in 40 games, and had a career-high of 14 wins, 12 losses, and a 2.39 ERA. In one game against the New York Giants, manager John McGraw threw insults at Brennan while he was pitching. After the game, Brennan went after McGraw and punched him twice; both were fined and suspended for five days. After the season ended, Brennan jumped to the newly formed Federal League and signed a three-year deal with the Chicago Federals. He pitched in 16 games in 1914 and 19 games in 1915, and spent most of both seasons suffering from arm trouble. He then spent two years with the minor league Atlanta Crackers, winning 28 games over that time. His career ended the following year after playing in two games for the Washington Senators and one game for the Cleveland Indians. After retiring, he served as head coach of the Fulton High School baseball team for two decades, and lived in Kansas City, Missouri until his death in 1962.

St. John began her career while still a teenager. By 1879, St. John was starring in new London productions, often creating roles, beginning with the title role in an English version of Madame Favart, which earned her critical praise. Despite occasional illnesses, she created the leading soprano roles in the light operas Olivette (1880), Barbe-bleue (1883), Nell Gwynne (1884) and Erminie (1885), among several others. In 1888, she joined the Gaiety Theatre company, playing Marguerite in the hit Victorian burlesque Faust up to Date, which toured America (1889‚Äì90), and then the British provinces. She then starred in Carmen up to Data. In the early 1890s, St. John continued to pay at the Gaiety and also toured in the operetta Rip van Winkle. In 1892, she starred in In Town, which became a hit and ushered in the age of the Edwardian musical comedy. This was followed by the hit the burlesque Little Christopher Columbus. In 1894, she joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in Mirette, created the role of Rita in The Chieftain and toured as Winifred in The Vicar of Bray. In the mid-1890s, she returned to concert singing, appearing regularly in the weekly Ballad Concerts at St James's Hall for many years. In 1897, she rejoined D'Oyly Carte, starring in the title role in the Savoy version of The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein. In 1900, St. John made her last appearance in musical theatre as Dolores in Florodora. In 1902, she turned to \\"straight\\" theatre, starring over the next few years in several roles in London and on tour. Later, she toured the provincial variety theatres with her own company in a piece titled My Milliner's Bill, or by herself singing ballads. Her last theatrical appearance was in 1909 as Lizi in The Merry Peasant at the Strand Theatre. Life and career St. John was born in Plymouth, England. Her father, Andrew Greig, had been stationed in Plymouth with the army, where he married St. John's mother, Susannah Williams, but he left the army before St. John was born. Her father ran a boarding house, and her mother a shop. She had five brothers and sisters.Sharp, p. 4 St. John's public singing debut was at a charity concert in Plymouth when she was eight years old. When she was 12, her parents sent her to a private boarding school in Kensington to study music and voice with Madame Marie Karger. Early career At the age of 16, while home for the holidays, she was asked to substitute for the ailing vocalist of a touring diorama company. Soon, she began to tour with N. S. Hodges' diorama.Biography at the Who Was Who website Her rendition of Arthur Sullivan's \\"Meet Me Once Again\\" resulted in a permanent engagement. With Hodges, she performed in Jacques Offenbach's Rose of Auvergne and Breaking the Spell.Information about Breaking the Spell At the age of seventeen, in 1872, she married the company's pianist and conductor, Alfred St. John. After this, St. John sang in provincial music halls and as a ballad singer in concerts. Alfred became ill, and in 1875 they moved to London, where she sang at the Oxford Music Hall under the name \\"Florence Leslie\\", and he taught music when he was well enough. He died in September of that year. By the end of the year, St. John had joined Charles Durand's English Opera Company on tour, where she began to use her married name on stage.Sharp, p. 5 With Durand, she began to play roles such as Clorinda, one of the stepsisters in Gioachino Rossini's Cinderella; in Luigi Ricci's The Brewer of Preston (Il birraio di Preston); as Azucena in Il Trovatore; and as Lazarillo in Maritana.Sharp, p. 6 St. John appeared in ten operas at the original Crystal Palace In February 1876, baritone Lithgow JamesBiography of St. John's 2nd husband, Lithgow James joined the company. In September, St. John joined Walsham's English Opera Company on tour. She and James married in December (though touring with different companies). The couple reunited on tour with and Blanche Cole's opera company. St. John had a wide vocal range \\"as well as considerable histrionic versatility,\\"Article on Mirette and St. John and in these small touring companies, she often had to play contralto roles. The couple soon joined the Rose Hersee Opera Company, which included Richard Temple. The Company gave a series of ten different operas at The Crystal Palace in August 1877, and St. John appeared in such roles as Cherubino in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, Urbano in Les Huguenots by Giacomo Meyerbeer, the title role in Maritana, Lelia in Satanella, the title role in La Cenerentola, Adalgisa in Norma, Lady Allcash in Fra Diavolo, and Azucena in Il Trovatore, among others.Pascoe, Charles Eyre. Our actors and actresses. The Dramatic List (1880) Oxford University In December, she sang again at The Crystal Palace as Fidalma in performances of Cimarosa's The Secret Marriage, with an English adaptation by W. Grist, directed by Temple, who also played Geronimo.The Musical Times, 1 January 1878 Star of light opera Alexander Henderson engaged St. John in 1878 to sing Germaine in the hit operetta, Les Cloches de Corneville by Robert Planquette with an English libretto by H. B. Farnie, in the provincial touring company (Alfred was cast opposite her as Henri, Marquis of Corneville). Towards the end of the record- setting London run, she took over the role in London, against her husband's wishes.Sharp, p. 7 The first London role that she created was the title role in Farnie's English-language version of Offenbach's Madame Favart, at the Strand Theatre in 1879.Reid, Erskine and Herbert Compton, The Dramatic Peerage (1892) Raithby, Lawrence & Co Ltd, London, pp. 195‚Äì96 She received high praise from the critics and her performance in the hit production made her a star. London's Daily News wrote that she was \\"a young actress of very pleasing appearance, who acts with remarkable vivacity and grace, possesses a mezzo- soprano voice of really fine quality, and sings in a style that indicates a thoroughly sound training....\\" The piece went on to run for over 500 performances, and St. John stayed until near the end of the run, when her doctor advised her to take a break before the next piece, which was already scheduled. St. John on a cigarette card, 1889 Her husband had reluctantly moved to London with her in 1879. The couple stayed with her parents, who had moved to London, but he had trouble getting work there. Later in the year he joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company on tour. In Madame Favart, St. John played opposite flamboyant French actor Claude Marius Duplany, and the co- stars fell in love, finally moving in together. James obtained a divorce from St. John in 1881, and Duplany's wife divorced him.Sharp, p. 8 Meanwhile, the couple starred together again in Farnie's next operetta, Olivette, composed by Edmond Audran. This opened in September 1880 and lasted for another astonishing run of 467 performances. After this, Duplany became the manager of the Avenue Theatre, and he and St. John starred there first in a revival of Madame Favart, and then in Manteaux Noirs (1882), Offenbach's posthumous La Belle Lurette, and Barbe-bleue (both in 1883). After these, they toured together in La Belle Lurette. In 1884, Henderson produced Farnie's Nell Gwynne, with St. John in the title role, then Farnie's The Grand Mogul, composed by Audran, with St. John as Djemma,The Times, 19 November 1884, p. 6, col. D and a revival of Barbe-bleue. In 1885, St. John starred in The Lady of the Locket at the Empire Theatre but fell ill after three months. At the end of the year, she created the title role in Erminie, but she was pregnant and soon had to leave the cast, and the role was taken over by Marie Tempest. St. John's father died that December. She and Duplany had not yet married and now took care of that detail on Christmas Day, 1885. Their son, Claud Reginald Duplany, was born on 30 March 1886. As soon as St. John was ready to go back to work, Erminie was revived with the original cast and then toured.Sharp, p. 9 In the autumn of 1886, St. John moved to the Prince of Wales's Theatre and played Jaquette in Andre Messager's La B√©arnaise, followed by another revival of Madame Favart at the Avenue Theatre in 1887. St. John fell ill again and left the cast. During this illness, she met Arthur Cohen, who would become her fourth husband ten years later. She went to Monte Carlo at the end of the year to recuperate further, and Cohen followed. Untrue rumours of a relationship between St. John and Cohen were circulated, and her husband grew jealous. More marital problems arose, the couple quarrelled frequently, and St. John left her husband in late 1888. In Carmen up to Data, 1890 As Rita in The Chieftain In October 1888 she joined the Gaiety Theatre company, under the management of George Edwardes, playing Marguerite in Faust up to Date, which was brought to America (1889‚Äì90) and later toured the British provinces in the same work. St. John and the tour were warmly received in the US. According to The Licensed Victuallers' Mail, an American fan sang humorously about how St. John pronounced her last name, as follows: :Oh, tell me why should Miss St. John :Pronounce her name as Sin Jin? :It would be better, two to one :I‚Äôve heard a hundred people say, :To substitute the hard g for j, :For then she would be singin‚Äô.The Licensed Victuallers‚Äô Mail, London, 31 January 1890, p.6b She returned to England to play the title role in the burlesque Carmen up to Data in the provincial tryout in Liverpool in September 1890 and then at the Gaiety, followed in 1891 by a provincial tour of the piece. One reviewer marvelled that St. John, coming from humble roots, \\"draws a salary in London of ¬£3,500 a year, whilst in America her services command ¬£100 a week. The Prime Minister of England is not so well paid.\\" Now almost 37 years old, St. John took over the teen-age title role in Miss Decima at Toole's Theatre in January 1892, then went on tour with Planquette's Rip van Winkle, returning after the summer to the Gaiety Theatre for a revival of Faust up to Date. In October, she and Arthur Roberts starred in In Town, which became a hit and ushered in the age of the Edwardian musical comedy. In 1893, she moved to the Lyric Theatre in the burlesque Little Christopher Columbus.Sharp, p. 11 Later years Now approaching the age of 40, St. John was engaged by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in October 1894 as a replacement in the title role of Mirette by Messager at the Savoy Theatre, giving a boost to the ailing production. The Era's reviewer wrote, \\"Mirette has gained in favour, and the other artists, stimulated by Miss St. John's presence, act and sing with greater animation.\\" After this, she created the role of Rita in Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand's The Chieftain at the Savoy (1894‚Äì95), earning good notices. She then toured briefly in 1895 with a D'Oyly Carte company as Mirette and as Winifred in The Vicar of Bray. On 9 June 1896, St. John played the plaintiff in a benefit performance of Trial by Jury for Kate Vaughan at the Gaiety Theatre, with Rutland Barrington as the judge and many other D'Oyly Carte singers, and the benefit also featured Marie Tempest, Letty Lind and other famous performers.Information about the Kate Vaughan benefit as the Grand Duchess For the next two years, St. John did little theatre work, except for brief runs in the Bric-a-brac Will and The Little Genius. Instead, she returned to singing, appearing regularly in the weekly Ballad Concerts at St James's Hall. In January 1896, her separated husband, who had been ill, died on the journey home from a South Africa tour. In February 1897, St. John married Arthur Cohen, her fourth husband. The marriage was not happy, but the couple stayed together until 1901. Meanwhile, in September 1897, St. John returned to the theatre in an Edwardes production of La P√©richole at the Garrick Theatre.Sharp, p. 12 In 1897‚Äì98, she rejoined the D'Oyly Carte at the Savoy, playing the title role in The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein.Review of the opening night of The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein from the London Times 6 December 1897 Though she received generally good notices, St. John bridled at the famously strict direction at the Savoy and later complained that she had not been allowed to \\"do any business of my own.\\" The Times review supports her judgment: \\"The English stage has no artist so well fitted as Miss Florence St. John to do full justice to Offenbach... her artistic singing would more than carry this off if she could recover the abandon of some of her former efforts. ...she looks the part to perfection, but she seems so afraid of overdoing the suggestion and roguery which are essential that she makes the impersonation seem sadly tame. It is as if she were overwhelmed with the atmosphere of the theatre in which she finds herself, or were affected more than all the rest by the prudish spirit in which the work has been approached.\\" Part of the programme for the Old Gaiety's farewell performance St. John made her last appearance in musical comedy as Dolores in Florodora (1900‚Äì01), taking over the role from Evie Greene. She made only one known recording, a single Berliner disc of \\"He Loves Me; He Loves Me Not,\\" from Florodora, which was reproduced on the Pearl LP set \\"The Art of the Savoyard: Volume II\\" (GEMM 282/3).Information from the G&S; Discography She did, however, continue singing in the St. James's Hall Ballad Concerts and in numerous benefits and charity concerts. In early 1902, now 47 years old, St. John turned to \\"straight\\" theatre, starting with a tour in the title role of English Nell, which had been played in London by Marie Tempest. In the autumn, she played Mrs. Brandram in Mrs. Willoughby's Kiss at the Avenue Theatre.Sharp, p. 13 In 1903, she played Mrs. Greaves in Billy's Little Love Affair at the Criterion Theatre,List of London plays followed in December of that year by the farce, Madame Sherry at the Apollo Theatre. She also appeared at the star-studded final performance at the \\"Old\\" Gaiety Theatre on 4 July 1903, singing Marguerite in an excerpt from Faust up to Date and led the singing of Auld Lang Syne. Other famous performers included Henry Irving, Gertie Millar, Seymour Hicks, George Grossmith, Jr., Rutland Barrington, Arthur Williams, Letty Lind, Harry Grattan, Edmund Payne and Richard Temple. With her career now on the decline and her income much less, St. John toured the provincial variety theatres, for the next several years, with her own company in a piece entitled My Milliner's Bill, or by herself singing ballads. She did appear at the Royalty Theatre in London in 1905 in a short run of The Diplomatists. Her mother died in 1904. St. John's last theatrical appearance was in late 1909 as Lizi in The Merry Peasant at the Strand Theatre. Known to her many friends as \\"Jack\\", St. John died in London a little more than two years later at the age of 56 and was cremated at Golders Green at a quiet ceremony attended by her son Reginald and the composer Leslie Stuart, among others.

While council chiefs are responsible for overall governance of individual bands and the tribe as a whole, the headmen of military societies are in charge of maintaining discipline within the tribe, overseeing tribal hunts and ceremonies, and providing military leadership.Greene 2004, p. 9. Historically, council chiefs selected which of the six military societies would assume these duties; after a period of time on-duty, the chiefs would select a different society to take up the duties.Hyde 1968, p. 336. Four original societies The prophet Sweet Medicine was said to designate the four original Cheyenne warrior societies (pl. N√≥t»ßx√©vƒóstot»Øtse, sing. N√≥t»ßx√©vest»Øtse), which had their own society songs (n√≥t»ßx√©noot»Øtse) and were governed by a head man (n√≥t»ßx√©vƒóhoneve). Over the ages, some have developed branches or have transformed. Fox Fox Warriors Society (V√≥hk√™s√©hetaneo'o or Mon√™s√≥onetaneo'o), also known as Swift Fox or Kitfox (sing. M√≥nƒós√≥onetane, pl. M√≥tsƒós√≥onetaneo'o; variant: sing. V√≥hkƒós√©hetane, pl. V√≥hkƒós√©hetaneo'o). This society is found among both the Northern and the Southern Cheyenne. The Coyote Warriors Society (O'√¥hom√©not√¢xeo'o) and Flintmen Society (sing. M√≥tsƒós√≥onetane, pl. Mots√™s√≥onetaneo'o) are branches of the Fox Warriors Society. Among the Northern Cheyenne the Kit Fox Soldiers always claimed superiority over the others. Had strong ties through marriages with Kit Fox Society (in Lakota: Toka'la) affiliated families of Lakota Sioux. Elk Elk Warriors Society also known as Elk Horn Scrapers (H√©mo'eoxeso),Glenmore & Leman, p. 176 Bone Scraper Society, Hoof Rattle, Crooked Lance, Headed Lance, Blue Soldiers or Medicine Lance.Llewellyn & Hoebel, p. 99Grinnell, p. 48 This society is found among both the Northern and the Southern Cheyenne. This was the society of the famous warrior Roman Nose, and also of the mixed-race Cheyenne George Bent. Shield Shield Warriors Society (Ma'√™hoohevaso), also known as Red Shield (sing. Ma'ƒóhoohƒìv»ßhtse, pl. Ma'ƒóhoohevase - ‚Ä≤Redshields, lazy group. Lit: red- nails(shields)‚Ä≤).Llewellyn & Hoebel, pp. 99-100 or Red Fox. This society was originally found in both the Northern and the Southern Cheyenne. Today it exists only among the Northern Cheyenne. Buffalo Warriors (Hot√≥an√≥t√¢xeo'o), also known as Buffalo Bull or Bull,Llewellyn & Hoebel, p. 100 is a branch of the Shield Warriors Society. Bowstring Bowstring Men (Hema'tan√≥nƒóheo'o, pl. H√©ma'tan√≥ohese - ‚Ä≤Bowstrings, Lit: those who have bowstrings‚Ä≤), also known as the Owl Man's Bowstring, because it was founded by the Cheyenne warrior named Owl Man. This society was originally found in both the Northern and the Southern Cheyenne. Today it is only among the Southern Cheyenne under the alternate name Wolf Warriors Society (Ho'n√©hen√≥t√¢xeo'o) for the Bowstring Men. The Crazy Dog Society developed out of the Bowstring Men in the 19th century through a vision given to Owl Friend. Among the Northern Cheyenne, the Wolf Warriors gradually adopted the name Crazy Dogs (Hotam√©m√¢s√™hao'o). Both groups - the Wolf Warriors Society (Southern Cheyenne) and the Crazy Dogs (Northern Cheyenne) - considered themselves constituents of the same organization originally called Bowstring Men. In the Northern Cheyenne tribe, both the Crazy Dogs and the Bowstrings or Wolf Warriors exist independently. Fifth society Dog Warrior Society (Hotam√©taneo'o), also known as Dog Men. This society was also called Dog Soldiers by the whites. The Dog Warrior Society was established by a directive given in a visionary dream after the prophet Sweet Medicine's departure. This society was originally found in both the Northern and the Southern Cheyenne. Today it exists only among the Southern Cheyenne. Crazy Dogs (Hotam√©m√¢s√™hao'o), also known as Foolish Dogs. This society is similar to the Bowstring Men in function, but is found only among the Northern Cheyenne. Among the Northern Cheyenne, Dog Warrior Society and Wolf Warriors merged. This resulted in the development of new Dog Warriors, now called the Crazy Dogs. The Crazy Dogs are considered by many to be a sixth society instead of a branch of the fifth society. \\"The...members imitate the coyote in their power of endurance, cunning and activity. They outstrip their fellow tribesmen in running long distances, playing games, etc. There are about 150 warriors in the society, and a head chief\\" (Dorsey, 1905, Vol. I: 19). Sixth society Contrary Warriors Society (Hohn√≥hkao'o), also known as the Inverted Bow-string Society. Its members, the Contrary Warriors, have proved their bravery by riding backward into battle.Hyde 1968, p. 337. Contrary Society (sing. Hohnohka, pl. Hohn√≥hkao'o), also known as Clown Society. This society draws upon the same spiritual powers as the Contrary Warriors Society. It is primarily composed of Cheyenne elders and may be a mature variation of the Contrary Warriors Society. They were charged with teaching the Cheyenne ceremonial ways of the cultural \\"dos\\" and \\"don'ts\\" through humour, sarcasm and satire, in a fashion contrary to the traditional Cheyenne culture. Warrior Women's Society Ehyophsta, who fought in the Battle of Beecher Island, was a member of a society of \\"women who had gone to war with their husbands\\" (Grinnell). That qualification seems to be wrong since she is known to have become a warrior only when she was widowed. John Sipes Jr, late Southern Cheyenne tribal historian, mentioned that his ancestor Mochi (Cheyenne) was a warrior in her own right, had her own war pony and war medicine and was also a member of that society.

Career O'Halloran began his professional football career with Derby County in 2000 but after a promising start, starring for the youth team including a memorable individual goal in the FA youth cup against Aston Villa and featuring regularly for the reserves he never featured in the first team. In late 2002 he spent over a month on loan at Burton Albion scoring the winner on debut in a 2-1 win away at Nuneaton. Grimsby Town and Hartlepool United were linked with a move for O'Halloran in May 2003 where he spent 3 weeks on trial with the club. He signed for Oldham Athletic on a non-contract basis at the start of the 2003‚Äì04 season, which was extended for another month in September 2003 with the highlight being his last minute winner against Rushden and Diamonds in a 3-2 win. He moved on a free transfer to Chesterfield in December 2003 but after tearing his hamstring on debut he struggled to return to full fitness. He then signed for Boston United in August 2004 making his debut against Leyton Orient but was in and out of the team and apart from his stoppage time thunderbolt against Scunthorpe United in a 2-1 win he failed to make a name for himself. O'Halloran signed for King's Lynn in March 2005 following becoming disillusioned with professional football and became an integral part of the team that challenged for the Southern Premier league title where he was joined by former Boston United teammate Dean West. He also played a prominent role scoring important goals in the clubs FA cup run in the 2006/2007 season, culminating in their 2nd-round game being televised live on Sky Sports against his former club Oldham Athletic eventually losing 2-0. . He re-signed for Boston in August 2007 but after a positive start injuries took their toll and he underwent a double hernia operation in the latter stages of the season . He was offered a new contract by manager Tommy Taylor but instead chose to sign for Corby Town where he scored on debut in the opening game of the season. Injuries again played their part and limited his appearances in the second half of the season but he was a member of the Southern Premier league title winning side that season. He left Corby at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season and joined his home town club Lincoln United alongside former Boston and King's Lynn teammate Steve Melton becoming a regular on the scoresheet from midfield. In October 2010, he joined Lincoln Moorlands Railway but persistent concerns with an ongoing back injury resulting in ruptured discs continued and he was forced to retire from competitive football at the age of 28. O'Halloran came out of retirement at the start of the 2013‚Äì2014 season having rejoined Lincoln United but overcoming the injuries proved difficult and following a stint at Sleaford Town he officially retired in October 2014.http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/lincolnunited/s/the- team-17190.html?player_id=1138534 NotesExternal links * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Nottingham Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Burton Albion F.C. players Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Boston United F.C. players Category:King's Lynn F.C. players Category:Corby Town F.C. players Category:Lincoln United F.C. players Category:Lincoln Moorlands Railway F.C. players Category:Sleaford Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players ","title":"Matt O'Halloran"},{"id":"13357848","text":"Ramon Neto da Costa (16 February 1987 ‚Äì 6 October 2018), better known as simply Ramon, was a Brazilian professional football player who played as a striker.

The Home Office states ANPR is used by law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom to help detect, deter and disrupt criminality including tackling organised crime groups and terrorists. Vehicle movements on UK roads are recorded by a network of 11,000 cameras that submit around 50 million ANPR \\"read\\" records to national ANPR systems daily. ANPR data from each police force is stored together with similar data from other forces for a period of one year, at the National ANPR Data Centre (NADC), which can be accessed, analysed and used as evidence as part of investigations by UK law enforcement agencies. The Conservative ‚Äì Liberal Democrat Coalition government placed ANPR under statutory regulation through the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. This established a right in law to collect the data, and placed controls on its use, storage and access by third parties.'Big brother' traffic cameras must be regulated, orders home secretary, The Guardian, published 2010-07-04. Retrieved 14 August 2010 The ANPR CCTV network The London congestion charge scheme uses two hundred and thirty cameras and ANPR to help monitor vehicles in the charging zone In 2005, the Independent reported that by the following year, most motorways, main roads, town centres, London's congestion charge zone, ports and petrol station forecourts have been covered by CCTV camera networks using automatic number plate recognition. Their report said existing traffic cameras in towns and cities are being converted to read number plates automatically as part of the new national surveillance network. > \\"What we're trying to do as far as we can is to stitch together the existing > camera network rather than install a huge number of new cameras,\\" - Mr > Whiteley chairman of the ANPR steering committee said. Some cameras may be disguised for covert operations but the majority will be ordinary CCTV traffic cameras converted to read number plates. Every police force will also have a fleet of specially fitted police vans with ANPR cameras. All data generated is fed to The National ANPR Data Centre. One camera can cover many motorway lanes. Just two ANPR devices, for instance, cover north and south movements through the 27 lanes of the Dartford crossing toll area on the Thames. Whiteley said the intention eventually was to move from the \\"low thousands\\" of cameras to the \\"high thousands\\". National ANPR Data Centre The National ANPR Data Centre stores all ANPR data feed from the various police forces, currently it does not take data from CCTV networks in the UK. It is based at Hendon in north London, on the same site used for the existing Police National Computer. In March 2006 the National ANPR Data Centre could store 50 million number plate 'reads' per day, to be expanded to 100 million 'reads' per day within a couple of years. The time, date and place of each vehicle sighting will be stored for two years. At the present 27 million clocks a day, over 18 billion ANPR records would be recorded every year. According to the National Policing Improvement Agency 25,000 hits per day against the ANPR database generate a transaction against the Police National Computer. National Policing Improvement Agency Annual Report and Accounts 2008/09. Page 10. Crosschecks CCTV cameras The National ANPR Data Centre is connected to the Police National Computer to provide up-to-date lists of vehicles connected by the police to crimes such as burglary or theft of petrol. Other crosschecks will include insurance-industry data to identify uninsured drivers, vehicles without a valid MoT test certificates, vehicles who have failed to pay for valid vehicle excise duty, and/or with vehicles with unlawful number plates. The National ANPR Data Centre allows analysis across police force boundaries. If a vehicle enters the ANPR network, the police should have an image of it entering the area, which may also show the driver and passenger. As the data generated is stored for two years the police argue criminals could be identified and linked to vehicles. Data mining The National ANPR Data Centre will make it possible for software to data mine previous sightings of license plate to identify patterns in the data. Patterns can be used to build up intelligence of a vehicle's movements on the road network or to find cloned vehicles by searching the database for impossibly quick journeys. > \\"We can use ANPR on investigations or we can use it looking forward in a > proactive, intelligence way. Things like building up the lifestyle of > criminals - where they are going to be at certain times. We seek to link the > criminal to the vehicle through intelligence. Vehicles moving on the roads > are open to police scrutiny at any time. The Road Traffic Act gives us the > right to stop vehicles at any time for any purpose\\" - Frank Whiteley, Chief > Constable of Hertfordshire and Chair of the ACPO ANPR Steering Group The database The National ANPR Data Centre uses an Oracle database, and custom-written Java software with specific police networks rather than the internet used to send and receive data. The system will be designed to work with possible future electronic vehicle identification marks on the bodywork of cars. Data access=Police All police forces have real-time access to ANPR camera data through direct links to the National ANPR Data Centre. Effectively, the police (and the security services) can track any car (technically any numberplate) around the country in close to real time. The current restraints on police use of ANPR data have been dictated by pragmatism rather than a concern for civil liberties. Giving every police officer free access to the system would overload the system, \\"make it unstable, slow it down\\", said John Dean, National ANPR co-ordinator for the Association of Chief Police Officers. ANPR records younger than 91 days can only be accessed on the NADC with an Inspector's authority to investigate serious and major crime. Enquiries over 90 days to a year require a Superintendent's authority and any searches over a year require a Superintendent's authority and must be for Counter Terrorism only. Mobile ANPR systems such as ProVida ANPR are becoming more popular, with forces having systems in traffic police intercept cars. The advantage of this is that officers can get real time 'hits' from passing vehicles as they are on patrol. Legislation In 2012, the government enacted the Protection of Freedoms Act which includes several provisions related to controlling and restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information about individuals. Under this Act, the Home Office published a code of practice in 2013 for the use of surveillance cameras, including ANPR, by government and law enforcement agencies. The aim of the code is to help ensure their use is \\"characterised as surveillance by consent, and such consent on the part of the community must be informed consent and not assumed by a system operator. Surveillance by consent should be regarded as analogous to policing by consent.\\" In addition, a set a standards were introduced in 2014 for data, infrastructure, and data access and management. History In August 2004 a presentation by John Dean, the Association of Chief Police Officers' (ACPO) National ANPR Co-ordinator at IFSEC revealed how ANPR was being used to 'deny criminals the use of the road'. On 18 November 2005 British police constable Sharon Beshenivsky was shot and killed during a robbery in Bradford. The CCTV network was linked into an ANPR system and was able to identify the getaway car and track its movements, leading to the arrest of six suspects. At its launch in May, Ch Supt Geoff Dodd of West Yorkshire Police, called the ANPR system a \\"revolutionary tool in detecting crime\\".\\"CCTV network tracks 'getaway' car\\" at BBC News, 21 November 2005 Project Laser in the United Kingdom In March 2005, plans were announced to set up a nationwide system of over 2,000 automatic number plate recognition cameras in the United Kingdom. This followed the successful rollout of Project Spectrum in which all 43 Police Forces in England and Wales were supplied by the Home Office with an ANPR capable mobile unit, and a 'Back Office'. A subsequent series of trials were then commenced in 2002 when the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) was given funding by the Home Office to work with the Police Standards Unit and develop \\"Project Laser\\" using the equipment supplied under Project Spectrum. With the aim of running the ANPR system nationwide, it was initially trialled by nine police forces and ran between 30 September 2002 and March 2003. Those police forces covered the areas of Greater Manchester, North Wales, Avon and Somerset, Northampton, London, Kent, West Yorkshire, Staffordshire and West Midlands The second phase of the project ran between 1 June 2003 and 21 June 2004 and involved 23 police forces in total. The DVLA is also involved with Project Laser, using the system to gather details on unregistered and unlicensed vehicles and those without a valid MOT certificate or insurance cover. > \\"Eventually the database will link to most CCTV systems in town centres, > meaning that all vehicles filmed on one of the many cameras protecting > Bedford High Street, for instance, can be checked against the database and > the movements of wanted cars traced to help with serious crime > investigations.\\" > ‚Äî Bedfordshire Police The project was seen as a success despite a Home Office report showing that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) trial had an error rate of up to 40%, with claims that the system was contributing > \\"‚Ä¶in excess of 100 arrests per officer per year ‚Äì ten times the national > average‚Ä¶\\" \\"Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) \\". Police Standards > Unit, PoliceReform.gov.uk. Further findings went on to show that the error rate dropped to 5% when infrared systems and more regular updates of information were used. During the second phase of the project around 28 million number plates were spotted in total, with 1.1 million (3.9%) of these matching an entry in one of the databases. 180,543 vehicles were stopped (101,775 directly because of the ANPR system), leading to 13,499 arrests (7.5% of the total) and the issue of 50,910 fines (28.2%). 1,152 stolen vehicles (worth ¬£7.5 million in total), ¬£380,000 worth of drugs and ¬£640,000 worth of stolen goods were also recovered. The primary goal of the second phase was to see how well the costs of the ANPR system could be covered. The final conclusion was that less than 10% of the expenditure incurred was recouped, with the Home Office claiming that the failure of drivers to pay fines contributed to this low figure, and continued to recommend the system be deployed throughout the UK.

He was son of Joseph Robidoux III and Catherine Marie Rollet. He arrived in California in 1844. He bought Rancho San Jacinto y San Gorgonio from James (Santiago) Johnson in 1845, and a portion of the Rancho Jurupa from Benjamin Wilson in 1849. Rubidoux became a successful rancher. He built the first grist mill in the area, operated a winery, and became one of San Bernardino County's first three supervisors. The town of Rubidoux and Mount Rubidoux in Riverside County, California are named for him. Biography Louis Rubidoux was born in St. Louis, Missouri on July 7, 1796. As a young man, Louis Rubidoux, was one of many French Canadians ancestry who worked as fur trappers and mountain men in northern New Mexico. He did not get along so well with Charles Bent, one of the most formidable businessmen in Taos at the time. Since the 1830s, Robidoux ‚Äîaccompanied by New Mexicans Lorenzo Trujillo, Hipolito Espinosa and Santiago Martinez‚Äîhad made treks from New Mexico to California in order to trade New Mexican blankets for California horses. New Mexicans had established a colony of over 150 families between 1840 and 1850. California ranchers Lugo and later Juan Bandini with the help of Lorenzo Trujillo and Santiago Martinez, had recruited the New Mexicans from Abiquiu‚Äîin exchange for land‚Äîto help fend off marauding Indians from taking their horses. However, Robidoux did not settle in California until 1844. At the time‚Äîaccompanied by his New Mexican wife and their recently born infant daughter as well as his namesake nephew Luisito‚Äîhe came through Sonora to live at Agua Mansa near today's Colton in the Riverside-San Bernardino area. Benjamin Davis Wilson of Tennessee, a fellow fur trapper in Taos, a couple of years before had accompanied John Rowland and William Workman in their 1841 trek from Taos‚Äîthrough Abiqiui-to settle in Agaua Mansa. Rubidoux later moved from Agua Mansa further west to a town and mountain near Riverside that bear his name. In New Mexico, Rubidoux and Wilson had been friends, but in California they were on different sides of an issue pertaining to the land rights of the New Mexican settlers. Rubidoux had joined a suit to deprive them of some of the disputed Bandini land that had been donated to the New Mexicans. Wilson, before the California Supreme Court, delivered ‚Äústrong testimony‚Äù against Robidoux on behalf of the New Mexican colonists. In later years, Wilson lived closer to Los Angeles and worked in the timber industry, becoming mayor of the big city. Mt. Wilson is named after him. Louis Rubidoux was a participant in the U.S.-Mexican War. He called himself a ‚Äúprisoner of war‚Äù in a letter he wrote in the fall of 1846 to Spanish-born U.S. Consul Manuel Alvarez residing in Santa Fe. Rubidoux addresses Alvarez as ‚ÄúMy dear sir and friend.‚Äù They had known each other for several years during the time Rubidoux lived in New Mexico. Alvarez had written Rubidoux two letters, one recounting the Taos Uprising of 1847. This is a response to both in which Rubidoux relates his experience in the California theatre of the U.S.-Mexican War. A few weeks after General Stephen Watts Kearny occupied Santa Fe on the August 18, 1846, Rubidoux and his neighbor Benjamin Wilson‚Äîtogether with 18 estrangeros or ‚Äústrangers,‚Äù i.e., foreigners, non-Mexicans, met at Wilson's home. The following day, Rubidoux writes, they went to Chino Ranch, ‚Äúsix leagues from my house.‚Äù They met with John Rowland and four or five others. Their intention was to go to Los Angeles to join the small American force that was stationed there. However, with a force of 200 men, ‚ÄúD[on]. Jose Ma[ria]. Flores, a military officer of the Mexican army, ‚Äúa man of superior attainments and courage,‚Äù attacked the next day, September 27, and set on fire the house in which they were gathered. After an hour's struggle, they surrendered with ‚Äúregret ‚Äú to avoid being burned alive. ‚ÄúFrom that moment I lost my liberty.‚Äù The prisoners were told to make ‚Äúsome determination of our property as well as of our families.‚Äù John Rowland expressed his desire that he would rather lose a leg than be cut off from his family. Rubidoux ‚Äúremembered the poor Texans and their sufferings who went afoot from New Mexico to the Capital (Mexico City) the half of whom died on the road‚Ä¶‚Äù However, the fear was for naught. Officer Jose Maria Flores was planning to take his prisoners to Mexico, but an opposing Mexican faction judged this would be against California interests and/or feared American reprisal, and convinced him not to march the prisoners to Mexico. The prisoners themselves paid ransom for their delivery, either to the opposing party or to Flores. ‚ÄúI believe in good faith, that he has during the whole period of the insurrection, acted with prudence, and that he has behaved as a good soldier‚Ä¶This same Flores whom I have just praised had made up his mind to send us as far as the capital of Mexico for the purpose of giving more weight to his exploits, or still better to the drafts he had issued upon the government. General Kearny arrived ‚Äúhere in November or December, with an escort of 100 dragoons. The cavalry ‚Äúfrom here, the best in all the Mexican Republic‚Äù attacked him before he got to San Diego. Over twenty of Kearny's men were killed, and as many were wounded including the General himself. Commodore Stockton joined Kearny at the head of 600 men, mostly sailors, and victoriously fought two battles on January 8 and 9, 1847. Rubidoux and companions were freed on January 10. Don Andres Pico succeeded Flores, and he asked for a treaty of peace that Colonel John C. Fremont granted ‚Äúin quite an honorable manner for the sons of the country.‚Äù Louis married Guadalupe Garcie (1812-1892) in 1834 in Santa Fe. Guadalupe was from one the old aristocratic families of New Mexico, and she and Louis had a large family, with at least 9 children. Louis died on 24 September 1868.

The mountain was once a popular Southern California tourist destination and is still the site of the oldest outdoor non-denominational Easter Sunrise service in the United States. Many historic markers and memorials have been placed on the mountain, the most prominent being the cross at the summit dedicated to Father Jun√≠pero Serra. A majority of Mt. Rubidoux is owned by the City of Riverside, while 0.43 acres at the peak is owned by Rivers & Lands Conservancy after the cross attracted a potential lawsuit and the city decided to sell it at auction it to a private organization (see Legal battle below). The Santa Ana River flows at the base of the mountain, marking the boundary between the city of Riverside and the Rubidoux neighborhood of the City of Jurupa Valley. The mountain was named for Louis Rubidoux, who established Rancho Rubidoux in 1847, after purchasing a portion of the Rancho Jurupa from Benjamin Davis Wilson, the second elected mayor of Los Angeles.Patterson, Landmarks..., p. 19. History The World Peace Bridge on Mount Rubidoux. Tom Patterson, as well as most local Riverside historians, have concluded that the original name of Mount Rubidoux was Pachappa. They speculate that one of the early owners of Rancho Jurupa reassigned the name Pachappa to another, smaller hill, in order to expand the property of the Rancho.Patterson, A Colony..., p. 82. Since Pachappa hill was designated as the southeast marker of the Jurupa Rancho, which was granted by the Mexican government to Juan Bandini in 1838, reassigning the name to the current Pachappa Hill would have expanded the Rancho Jurupa significantly, incorporating all of the area covered by today's downtown Riverside. It is also possible the United States government renamed the hills in order to satisfy acreage requirements of the original Mexican land Grant.Gunther, p. 337. In 1906 Frank Miller, owner of the Mission Inn, along with Henry E. Huntington and Charles M. Loring, formed the Huntington Park Association and purchased the property with the intent to build a road to the summit and develop the mountain as a park to benefit the city of Riverside.Gale, pp.155‚Äì156. Originally the park was named Huntington Park, but the name was changed to the Frank A. Miller Mount Rubidoux Memorial Park after the heirs of Frank Miller donated the property to the city in 1955. On December 13, 1925, the Testimonial Peace Tower was dedicated to Miller. The bridge is a replica of a noted bridge in Alc√°ntara, Spain.Baber, p. 154. A plaque for 1932 Olympic equestrian Shunzo Kido was placed on the bridge in 1934 honoring his sacrifice of an Olympic medal in order to save his horse, Kyu Gun, from lameness. Initial improvements, including the road, were completed in February 1907.Hutchings, p. 11 (unnumbered). The first memorial marker on the mountain, the cross and tablet at the summit honoring Father Junipero Serra, was dedicated on April 26, 1907. Serra supposedly often travelled through the valley and rested at Rubidoux Rancho. A sunset over Mount Rubidoux, in 1909, was the occasion for Carrie Jacobs-Bond to compose her famous song \\"A Perfect Day\\" which for many years was played each day as the last tune on the Mission Inn's carillon.Mission Inn Museum Jacobs-Bond site. Mount Rubidoux was designated Riverside City Landmark no. 26, and has been a city park since 1955, when the land was donated to the city by Frank Miller's heirs.Patterson, Landmarks..., p. 115. The park features 3.5 miles of paved and dirt hiking trails. Easter sunrise service 1913 Mt Rubidoux Easter Sunrise Services.In April 1909, Jacob Riis of New York, a friend of President Theodore Roosevelt, was in town to give an address at the Mission Inn. He suggested holding an Easter sunrise service at the top of the mountain, and on the following Sunday the first non-denominational outdoor Easter Sunrise Service in the United States was held at the top of the mount.2014 Mt. Rubidoux Easter Sunrise Service In 1912 an estimated crowd of 3,000 people were present to hear Henry Van Dyke read his poem, God of the Open Air. Each year attendance grew. In 1918 plans for an open-air 10,000-seat amphitheater designed by architect Frederick Heath were considered, but they were never implemented.Western architect and engineer, Volumes 52‚Äì53 McGraw- Hill Co. of California, 1918 Original from the New York Public Library Digitized Jun 17, 2008. The annual service became nationally and internationally known, drawing huge crowds and celebrities, including opera soprano Marcella Craft.Durian, Hal. \\"Riverside Was Marcella Craft's 'American' Home\\", The Press-Enterprise, May 16, 2010, p. C5. In 1915 the Southern Pacific Railroad provided a special service from Los Angeles to Riverside just for the event. The Pacific Electric trolley system also implemented special service from Los Angeles, Corona, Redlands, and San Bernardino.Wenzel, p. 13. Peak attendance in the 1920s was reported to have exceeded 30,000.Wenzel, pp. 18‚Äì22. The popularity of the Rubidoux Easter sunrise services spawned many other such services throughout the country, including an annual service at the Hollywood Bowl.Gale, p. 157.  Legal battle  In November 2012 the legal advocacy organization, Americans United for Separation of Church and State sent a letter to the City of Riverside threatening a lawsuit for having a large cross on city-owned property. The group believes that owning the cross violates a legal doctrine set forth in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which says \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\\" . In a city council meeting on January 22, 2013 the City of Riverside city council decided to sell the cross atop Mount Rubidoux as well as 0.43 acres of land beneath it . The land includes a portion of the rocky hilltop, the cross, the steps beneath it, and a small portion of the asphalted area at the bottom of the steps. The land would be sold at public auction on April 11, 2013 with a minimum bid of $10,000. A group named \\"Totally Mt. Rubidoux\\" was formed in response to the potential lawsuit threatened in late 2012. The group is a collaborative effort by the Friends of Mt. Rubidoux, Mission Inn Foundation & Museum, and Rivers & Lands Conservancy (then Riverside Land Conservancy) to ensure that the property on the peak of Mt. Rubidoux is substantially preserved in its current state, reasonably maintained, and kept accessible to members of the public for their enjoyment. Through a fundraising campaign to raise money to purchase the peak at auction, and maintain it in perpetuity, with help from the community Totally Mt. Rubidoux raised nearly $260,000. On April 11, 2013 Totally Mt. Rubidoux placed the winning bid of $10,500 on the peak of Mt. Rubidoux, purchasing it in the name of Rivers & Lands Conservancy to be the sole owner and manager of Mt. Rubidoux Peak. After the purchasing costs, and setting aside funds for three years of management, education, and stewardship, about $190,000 were invested in a non-wasting endowment so that the interest earned could be used to manage the land in perpetuity. Mount Rubidoux today Mount Rubidoux continues to be an important landmark and valued asset to the people of Riverside. On April 12, 2009, the 100th anniversary of the Easter Sunrise service was held at the top of Mount Rubidoux.PE.Com, The Press Enterprise Co., Mount Rubidoux Easter sunrise service to mark centennial, April 5, 2009. The city launches its premier fireworks show from the top of the mountain every Fourth of July. Mount Rubidoux Park is open from dawn until dusk. It covers and features of paved roads and several dirt hiking trails. The park is closed to vehicular traffic, but improvements in 2009 boosted the number of daily walkers, joggers, and bicyclists.Robinson, Alicia. Everything's good in the view from Mount Rubidoux. The Press Enterprise, August 1, 2009. The hill is also a popular place for bouldering, particularly for beginners in the sport.Fry, p. 150. All roads and trails are maintained in good condition by the city and by the Friends of Mount Rubidoux, a non-profit organization formed by citizen volunteers to restore, preserve, and beautify Mount Rubidoux Park, to enhance knowledge of the rich history of Mount Rubidoux Park, and to foster enjoyment by visitors to Mount Rubidoux.http://www.mt-rubidoux.org See also * Mount Soledad Cross lawsuits, lengthy legal battle regarding the cross located near San Diego, California * Salazar v.

In the late 1990s and 2000s they were mainly worn by middle- aged American women and considered unhip by trendy younger women. High waisted, ankle length ‚Äúmom jeans‚Äù have since become fashionable again in the late 2010s and into the 2020s with younger women from tween and teen aged girls, on up through college aged women and beyond. Many women wear their t-shirt, sweatshirt, sweater or other top tucked into the jeans with a belt to complete the look. Originally a pejorative and derogatory term, mom jeans gained prominence from a May 2003 Saturday Night Live skit written by Tina Fey for a fake brand of jeans called Mom Jeans, which used the tagline \\"For this Mother's Day, don't give Mom that bottle of perfume. Give her something that says, 'I'm not a woman anymore...I'm a mom!' \\" Characteristics This style usually consists of a high waist rising above the navel, making the buttocks appear disproportionately longer, larger, and flatter. Mom jeans have excess space in the zipper, crotch and leg areas. The jeans are usually in a solid, light-blue color, with no form of stone washing or fading. Other attributes of the style often seen are pleats, tapered legs, and elastic waistbands. The style is often accompanied by a blouse or shirt that is tucked into the jeans. This style of jeans was popular with trendy young women in the United States until the mid '90s, when lower rise jeans started to become fashionable. However, high waisted ankle length mom jeans have once again since become fashionable in the late 2010s and into the 2020s with younger women from tween and teen ages on up through college and age and beyond into their 20s, 30s, 40s etc. with many wearing their t-shirt, sweatshirt, sweater or other top tucked into the jeans and a belt wore with the jeans.  Dad jeans  Barack Obama practices pitching wearing \\"dad jeans\\" in advance of throwing the ceremonial first pitch at the 2009 MLB All-Star Game A corresponding term, dad jeans, has been coined in popular media to refer to an unflattering, high- waisted and shapeless style of jeans often worn by middle-aged American men. The term gained popularity in 2009 when President Barack Obama wore dad jeans during the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In March 2015, Obama appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the \\"Mean Tweets\\" segment, in which he read a tweet mocking him over the jeans.

They usually had a ring in the end of the handle so that they could be worn on a ribbon or gold chain around the neck.

The word \\"Place\\" in this context is thought to be a precursor of the word \\"Palace\\". Description The house is a Grade I listed building. Mentioned in the Doomsday Book and owned by Roger de Lacy at the time, the house has undergone considerable alteration since its 11th century beginnings with only the moat remianing. The house seems to have started out as a modest courtyard dwelling, but later (sometime before 1423) was made grander by the creation of the great hall and remodelling of the solar (with barrel vaulted timber roof). The building has many unique features - for example: no room has a right angle on its plan view with all rooms being a trapezium in form. The oldest parts of the building date from between 1086 and 1420 include the undercroft (northwest wing), the battlemented gateway and the southeast wing, originally the kitchens and servants' quarters. The great hall is disproportionally large and its upper end obtrudes into the line of the solar range. It is a substantial room of and is divided into five bays by braced collar-beam trusses in the walls at the side. Other similar trusses extend along the entire north range which contain two original bedrooms. These bedrooms have fireplaces connected to mid-level chimney stacks. The 17th century parts of the house on the east elevation include a Great chamber on the first floor which contain a pair of one of the world's earliest surviving flying (or floating) mullion windows. The alterations carried out in c.1420 were undertaken by the then owner - Sir John Blacket ‚Äúthe hero of Agincourt‚Äù (who fought alongside Henry V of England at the Battle of Agincourt and is buried in the nearby church). At this point the house had two courtyards., and most of the oak timber used for the re-roofing was felled in the winter of 1421/1422 from the nearby Cirencester area. After a period of dereliction during the 18th and 19th centuries the house was bought by Samuel Simpson Hayward, the father of George Simpson-Hayward who made alterations to the building. The renovation at the start of the 20th century demolished the South wing and Southern courtyard and constructed a Rock garden and extensive Greenhouses, some of which remains today.

The oldest state prison in North Carolina, it has operated from 1892 to the present. It is located in Halifax County, on approximately 7,500 acres that was purchased by the state in 1899. The prison is mostly for men serving a life sentence. Halifax Community College works with the prison to provide vocational classes like cook school, block masonry, plumbing. Inmates may participate in classes for adult education and preparation for the GED tests. Inmates may also take part in self-help programs on substance abuse, stress, Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, DART aftercare, minimum custody readiness and self-improvement. About 5,500 acres of farmland are under cultivation at Caledonia. Correction Enterprises manages the farm which contains cattle, chickens and row crops such as corn, wheat, cotton and soybeans. In addition, the inmates farm 300 acres of vegetables like tomatoes, sweet corn, collard greens, sweet potatoes, squash, cucumbers and melons. During the off-season, fresh vegetables are grown in greenhouses. Inmates also work in the prison's cannery. The cannery processes and cans crops grown on the farm for distribution to prison kitchens across the state. It is 12,770 square feet and has the capability of canning about 500,000 gallons of commodities per year. Inmates may also work as janitors or kitchen help. History Sleeping quarters, 1927 Historically, prisoners worked either in a workshop or on a chain gang. The prison was made up of a prison building and some camps outside. Inmates would travel through Sampson County to railroad tracks to work long hours. With the intent of putting inmates to work, the General Assembly leased the Caledonia farm in 1890. Nine years later, the property was purchased for $61,000. Roanoke River flooding damaged the farm in 1901 and 1902. In 1919, the prison farm was auctioned in parcels for a total of $497,000. The auction raised little cash since most of the land was purchased on credit. Flooding problems continued to plague the area and practically the entire farm was repossessed by the state within five years of the auction. About 600 inmates were returned to the prison and housed in temporary wooden shacks. They worked to ditch and clear the land for farming. In 1925 construction began on a brick dormitory. Inmates moved into the building in 1927. Heat and hot water were provided the inmates in 1929. Caledonia's main building originally housed men and women. Eight dormitories downstairs housed men and two dormitories upstairs housed women. Today the dorms house medium custody adult male inmates. In 1976, 144 additional cells were built.

In the game, two enemy kingdoms, separated by a mountain, try to destroy the castle of the enemy by exchanging cannonballs. Two conditions can lead to victory: either you pulverize the opponent's king by directly hitting him with a cannonball, or you ruin the enemy kingdom's economy until the king capitulates automatically. There is a choice of various castles, each of them outfitted with multiple cannons, one destroyable storage room for each, gunpowder, cannonballs and money, and a vane. One cannon can be fired per turn, which is done by adjusting the firing angle and amount of powder. An additional challenge is generated by the wind, which changes its strength each turn. The game also simulates a simple economy system: Prices to replenish the stock of balls and powder and replace destroyed cannons and vanes alter each turn. You have the possibility to build (destroyable) derricks for more income and can raise or lower taxes, which will be reflected in the morale of your people. Unhappy people would abandon you and instead join your opponent.

He was born on 14 August 1895 in Moscow, and he died there in 1938. His father, was a professional musician in the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra. At the relatively late age of eighteen, Grigoriev joined the Moscow chess club and played in the Moscow tournament of 1915. There, one of his opponents was the future world champion Alexander Alekhine against whom he lost but later maintained friendly relations. In 1917, he was drafted into the Imperial Russian army in the First World War and was sent to the front. He was wounded and returned severely ill. In early October 1937, Grigoriev returned from a trip to the Far East and Siberia, where he gave lectures and played. The NKVD militia on the train arrested him. Grigoriev was frail; he lost consciousness immediately after the use of force, and his throat began to constantly bleed. After an interrogation, the interrogators had to wash down the room. An unexpected illness then confined him to bed. Severe complications required immediate surgery. The patient was severely weakened and died of lung cancer.http://www.chesspro.ru/_events/2008/grigoriev.html  Playing career  Grigoriev was Moscow Champion four times: in 1921, 1922, 1923‚Äì24 and 1929. His playing career spanned from 1910 to 1929. He lost games to Alexander Alekhine (1915 and 1919) and Mikhail Botvinnik (1927); both would later become chess world champions. In the First Soviet Chess Championship (Moscow 4‚Äì24 October 1920) Grigoriev took 5-7th place (8 wins, 6 losses, and only one draw), despite undertaking extensive and difficult organizational duties including finding scare food rations for the participants. Before his departure from Russia in 1921, Alekhine played a match with Grigoriev of 7 games resulting in 2 wins and 5 draws in favour of Alekhine. Analyzing the match, Levenfish said: \\"In some of the games only exceptional ingenuity saved Alekhine from destruction.\\" Grigoriev competed in various internal Soviet tournaments. His tournament victories included: the Third Chess Championship of the Trade Unions 1928 and he divided the 1-2nd places with Peter Romanovsky in the international Workers' Congress in Leningrad. Grigoriev became better known, however, as a chess organizer and educationalist, chess journalist and problemist.  Composing career  Grigoriev composed more than 300 endgame studies.Article by Harold van der Heijden in EG (magazine). He is especially noted for his prolific output of pawn endgames with only kings and pawns on the board, where he had no equal. In 1935, the French magazine La Strat√©gie organized a tourney for endgame studies with two pawns against one, and Grigoriev ran away with ten of the twelve awards.\\"Endgame Explorations 9: Grigoriev.\\" Article by Noam Elkies, originally published in Chess Horizons.

Example study 2  In Diagram 2, White wins a pawn race through a beautiful repetitive maneuver: :1.f4 Threatens to queen on move 5 with check, after which the queen can stop Black's pawn if it advances to d2. Black's best defense is to try to chase the White pawn with his king. :1...Kb4 :2.h4 d5 The Black king cannot catch the h-pawn, so now Black must counterattack by advancing his d-pawn.

So... :3.f5 Kc5 :4.h5 d4 And the pattern repeats itself again: :5.f6 Kd6 :6.h6 d3 :7.f7 Ke7 :8.h7 d2 Now, finally, White provides the coup de grace: :9. f8=Q+ Kxf8 :10. h8=Q+ Ke7 :11.

This species has been identified as being of Special Concern by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).  Distribution  The bridle shiner is found in eastern North America, from eastern Lake Ontario, east to Maine, and south to South Carolina. In Ontario, it is found in lowland areas in the eastern Lake Ontario drainage and the Saint Lawrence River. The most stable population is found around the Thousand Islands. Characteristics *Small, slender body; somewhat compressed laterally *Average adult length of 50 mm *Snout length usually smaller than eye diameter *Small, angular, terminal mouth *Large scales; lateral line incomplete *Straw-coloured, silvery dorsal side with a green-blue iridescence and silvery-white on ventral side *Prominent black lateral band from tail to snout *Males develop minute nuptial tubercles on the head, nape and pectoral fin  Habitat and life history  The bridle shiner is found in quiet areas of streams and occasionally in lakes. It is usually associated with abundant submersed aquatic vegetation and a river bottom composed of silt and sometimes sand. It uses the vegetation for protection, feeding, and spawning. It has been found in moderately turbid water, but prefers clear water.  Diet  The bridle shiner mainly feeds on zooplankton and aquatic insect larvae such as chironomids. Plant materials make up a small portion of its diet.  Threats  Like all members of the minnow family, they can be prey for larger fish species such as northern pike, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch. This species is vulnerable to poor water quality and high turbidity, particularly in agricultural areas. In areas where zebra mussels have invaded, the improved water clarity may benefit this species. The densely growing Eurasian watermilfoil aquatic plant hinders spawning areas for the minnow and may contribute to its decline.  Similar species  The sand shiner (Notropis stramineus) and mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus) are similar, but lack a prominent lateral band. The bridle shiner is very similar to other black-lined shiners, including the pugnose shiner (Notropis anogenus), blackchin shiner (Notropis heterodon) and blacknose shiner (Notropis heterolepis). The bridle shiner can be distinguished from pugnose and blackchin shiners by the lack of pigment on the lower jaw. Blacknose shiners also lack this pigment, but have a more subterminal mouth as well as eight anal rays: bridles typically have seven.  References  * Robert Jay Goldstein, Rodney W.

After winning $200,000 there, they began working the Omaha, Nebraska to Kansas City trains until the Union Pacific Railroad management started clamping down on three-card monte players. In response, Jones wrote to the general superintendent of the railroad, offering $10,000 a year to secure an exclusive franchisePinkerton, Criminal Reminiscences and Detective Sketches, pp. 200-201. while other accounts reported that he offered Union Pacific's officers $1000 a month or $30,000 a year if they would let him play monte on their trains, but those offers were rebuffed.\\"Three Keerd Monkey,\\" Little Rock Daily Republican, September 14, 1872, p. 3, reprinted in San Francisco Bulletin, September 25, 1872, p. 4; \\"Robbers of the Rail: the Monte Gamblers of the Overland Route,\\" Inter Ocean, June 27, 1874, p. 2. Jones moved on to Chicago, in 1874, teaming up with Jimmy Porter and \\"Colonel\\" Charlie Starr. While there, he opened and worked four gambling houses, all reportedly with criminal histories. Winning and losing as much as $150,000 in a year, he reportedly was often duped by other gamblers during short card cons. Moving on to Cleveland with Porter, he continued to lose to professionals there as fast as he won from his marks. After relocating to Berks County, Pennsylvania in 1877, Jones fell ill with consumption (tuberculosis). A pauper, he was admitted to the charity hospital in Reading, Pennsylvania for treatment. Roughly 40 years old at the time of his death there on October 22, 1877, he was buried at Reading's Charles Evans Cemetery.\\"Canada Bill's Funeral: The Career of a Western Train Gambler Who Won Money by Thousands\\", in Watertown Republican, November 14, 1877.

It broadcasts in the FM radio band at 95.3 MHz and has a news-talk format. History When 95.3 FM signed on in 1986 with the call letters WDFP, the owner was Donald F. Price and the format was Christian music and religious programming. In 1988 the station was sold to Captsar Broadcasting. WMJC as Magic 95 With an ERP of 3,000 watts, 95.3 could be reached as far west as Kalamazoo and was changed to a top-40 station as WMKG then switched to WMJC as \\"Magic 95\\" these calls came from 94.7 FM in Detroit now WCSX. The ratings proved the best of this frequency has seen. Top-40 powerhouse WKFR was dominant mostly due to its signal on 103.3 FM which reached as far as Jackson to Benton Harbor. In the late 1990s the station began to take a more rhythmic sound similar to how WGRD was in the 1990s. Capstar introduced the station as \\"B95\\" WBXX. WBXX as B95 As WBXX \\"B95\\", 95.3 FM was a very popular CHR-top 40 station in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Despite the station's high ratings (especially with younger listeners), B95 was unsuccessful in terms of revenue because it played hip hop and rap music that was unpopular with local advertisers. This led the station to change format to oldies and later adult contemporary; the latter format continued on 104.9 FM until 2016 when they flipped to its current alternative rock format. The sale of the Battle Creek Radio Group from Clear Channel Communications has been completed. 95.3 began to simulcast with WBCK (930 AM) and WBXX began broadcasting on 104.9 (formerly WRCC). 95.3 FM became the permanent home of WBCK's news-talk format. On March 21, 2008, AM 930 and FM 95.3 stopped the simulcast between both stations, while AM 930 began airing a classic country station as Country 93. On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus Media stations, including WBCK-FM, for $238 million. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global were both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013. The \\"-FM\\" suffix was dropped from the station's call sign on July 10, 2014, after 930 AM (which by this point had been sold separately to Midwest Communications) changed callsigns to WTOU.

Following the Battle of Bramall Lane in 2002, in which a Division One fixture against West Bromwich Albion was abandoned due to having only six players left on the pitch, fans of the two clubs were involved in fighting outside the ground. During United's 5-3 Division One victory over Cardiff City in 2003, there were numerous incidents of coin-throwing and violence between supporters, and four Cardiff fans were injured. In May 2011, Blades hooligans threw missiles at visiting Barnsley fans at Sheffield station following the clubs' relegation from the Championship. Three men were later convicted with affray. In March 2012, four members of the firm attacked a group of teenage Brentford fans after the League One clash at Griffin Park.

Kazi was born in Sindh, Bombay Presidency, in 1919 to an academic family. He started his career in the Indian Civil Service in 1944 and served as the Deputy Commissioner of Bihar and Orissa. After the partition of India, Kazi migrated to Pakistan and joined the Provincial Government of Sindh, and held positions such as Secretary of Finance and Secretary to the Governor. During the early 1960s, Kazi was Economic Minister in the Pakistan Embassy to the USA. After a brief stint as Additional Chief Secretary of West Pakistan, he was appointed Chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority. In that role, he was responsible for the completion of the Mangla Dam Project. In March 1969, he was appointed Secretary for Industries and Natural Resources and then a year later he became Finance Secretary, a post he held for over three years until his elevation as Secretary General. After the power struggle triggered by General Yahya Khan's general election, Zulfikar Bhutto became the new leader of Pakistan. In 1973, Kazi became Secretary General Finance and Economic Coordination. When Ghulam Ishaq Khan became Finance Minister, Kazi was appointed Economic Advisor to the President in July 1977. In 1978, Kazi was appointed as Governor of State Bank of Pakistan until 1986. The Pakistan State Bank, under Kazi, was characterised by excellent financial discipline in the banking sector coupled with good relations with the Federal Government. Kazi was the longest-serving civil servant in the history of Pakistan. As a leading civil servant, Kazi passed through several major events in the history of Pakistan, including the removal of Bhutto and the mysterious death of General Zia-ul-Haq. In 1993, he was appointed as the chairman Privatization Commission and was again given the status of a Federal Minister as Chief Executive of the Pakistan Investment Board. In 1994, Kazi retired from office, at the age of 75, and led a quiet retired life in Islamabad. He died on 9 August 2016 after a prolonged illness. At his death, he was among the last living members of the old Indian Civil Service. Early life Kazi was born into a Sindhi, working-class family consisting of his father Khan Bahadur Ghulam Nabi Kazi, an educationist, and his sibling Bashir Ghulam Nabi Kazi would later go on to become a senior Judge at the Sindh High Court and later the Federal Shariat Court. The family originated from Sindh, Bombay Presidency, British India. His father was a veteran educationist of Sindh who had been awarded the MBE by the British Government for his services to humanity and social development. Anybody who suggests that a Khan Bahadur and an MBE was a member of the middle class during British colonial rule of India is being modest. His family was a member of Indian aristocracy. On the separation of Sindh from Bombay, Khan Bahadur Ghulam Nabi Kazi was appointed the first Director of Public Instructions Sindh in 1936. Kazi received his education in Jamshoro, Sindh, and went on to attend the Cathedral and John Connon School in 1930. Education and academia After graduating from school, Kazi attended the University of Bombay from 1937. He graduated with a BS in statistics in 1941, and later went on to gain MSc in physics and Master of Arts in mathematics from the University of Bombay. In 1943, he sat the last-ever Indian Civil Service examinations from there, becoming a member of the final cadre of the ICS. Before joining the civil service, Kazi worked in the Department of Mathematics of D. J. Science College, teaching courses in Mathematics and Statistics. In 1944, he was one of the three Muslims selected for the Indian Civil Service, the others being Agha Shahi and Mian Riazuddin Ahmed. Thus, Kazi started a career that would last for half a century making him the longest serving civil servant in the history of Pakistan. Civil service in India The British Raj appointed Kazi as Deputy Commissioner in Bihar and Orissa where he served until 1947. He was asked by the British Government to stay in India, but he opted for Pakistan after partition in 1947. He arrived in his home town and joined the Government of Sindh, holding pivotal positions such as Secretary to Governor and Secretary Finance. Senior offices held After the amalgamation of all provinces in the western wing of the country in 1955, Kazi was appointed Finance Secretary of West Pakistan. In the early 1960s he was posted as Economic Minister in the Pakistan Embassy in Washington DC USA where he served until 1965. On his return to Pakistan, he was appointed for a brief period as Additional Chief Secretary (Planning nd Development) West Pakistan and thereafter as Chairman of Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). It was during his tenure as chairman WAPDA that the Mangla Dam was inaugurated and on this occasion he was awarded the high civil award of Sitara-e-Pakistan. Previously he had also been awarded the Sitara-e-Khidmat. In 1969, he was appointed Secretary for Industries and Natural Resources and a year later as Finance Secretary to the Government of Pakistan. He held this office during the crisis of 1971. In this capacity, he was also Chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue. List of Chairmen of CBR/FBR and Secretaries of Finance In 1973, Kazi was assigned the highest grade in the civil service and made Secretary General, Finance and Economic Coordination in which capacity he had to supervise the working of all the economic and planning ministries of the government.

Like miraculin, curculin exhibits taste-modifying activity; however, unlike miraculin, it also exhibits a sweet taste by itself. After consumption of curculin, water and sour solutions taste sweet. The plant is referred to locally as 'Lumbah' or 'Lemba'.  Protein structure  The active form of curculin is a heterodimer consisting of two monomeric units connected through two disulfide bridges. The mature monomers each consist of a sequence of 114 amino acids, weighing 12.5 kDa (curculin 1) and 12.7 kDa (curculin 2), respectively. While each of the two isoforms is capable of forming a homodimer, these do not possess the sweet taste nor the taste-modifying activity of the heterodimeric form. To avoid confusion, the heterodimeric form is sometimes referred to as \\"neoculin\\". *1, 1-50: DNVLLSGQTL HADHSLQAGA YTLTIQNKCN LVKYQNGRQI WASNTDRRGS *1, 51-100: GCRLTLLSDG NLVIYDHNNN DVWGSA _C_ WGD NGKYALVLQK DGRFVIYGPV *1, 101-114: LWSLGPNG _C_ R RVNG *2, 1-50: DSVLLSGQTL YAGHSLTSGS YTLTIQNNCN LVKYQHGRQI WASDTDGQGS *2, 51-100: QCRLTLRSDG NLIIYDDNNM VVWGSD _C_ WGN NGTYALVLQQ DGLFVIYGPV *2, 101-113: LWPLGLNG _C_ R SLN Amino acid sequence of sweet proteins curculin-1 and curculin-2 adapted from Swiss-Prot biological database of protein sequences. Intra-chain disulfide bonds in bold, inter-chain disulfide bonds underlined. Sweetness properties Curculin is considered to be a high-intensity sweetener, with a reported relative sweetness of 430-2070 times sweeter than sucrose on a weight basis. A sweet taste, equivalent to a 6.8% or 12% sucrose solution, was observed after holding curculin in the mouth in combination with clear water or acidified water (citric acid), respectively. The sweet taste lasts for 5 minutes with water and 10 minutes with an acidic solution. The taste-modifying activity of curculin is reduced in the presence of ions with two positive charges (such as Ca2+ and Mg2+) in neutral pH solutions, although these ions have no effect in acidic solutions. In the same way, monovalent ions (such as Na+ and Cl‚àí) have no effect in solutions with either neutral or acidic pH. Although the \\"sweet-inducing\\" mechanism is unknown, it is believed that one active site of curculin strongly binds to the taste receptor membranes while a second active site fits into the sweet receptor site. The latter site is thought to be responsible for the induction of sweetness. Presence of Ca2+ and/or Mg2+, water and acids tune the binding of the active site of curculin to the receptor site and therefore modify perceived sweetness. Curculin appears to use a unique binding site at the amino terminal of TAS1R3. As a sweetener Like most proteins, curculin is susceptible to heat. At a temperature of the protein starts to degrade and lose its \\"sweet-tasting\\" and \\"taste-modifying\\" properties, so it is not a good candidate for use in hot or processed foods. However, below this temperature both properties of curculin are unaffected in basic and acidic solutions, so it has potential for use in fresh foods and as a table-top sweetener. Because curculin is not widely found in nature, efforts are underway to produce a recombinant form of the protein. In 1997, curculin was expressed in E. coli and yeast, but the recombinant protein did not exhibit \\"sweet-tasting\\" or \\"taste-modifying\\" activity. However, a 2004 study obtained a recombinant curculin, expressed in E. coli, exhibiting \\"taste-modifying\\" and \\"sweet-tasting\\" properties. In addition to challenges related to commercial production of the protein, there are many regulatory and legal issues remaining to be resolved before it can be marketed as a sweetener. Curculin currently has no legal status in European Union and United States. However it is approved in Japan as a harmless additive, according to the List of Existing Food Additives established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (English publication by JETRO).

Congresses  Every four years, the AIC organizes international color congresses. It is also responsible for arranging midterm meetings, which take place two years after the congress, and interim meetings, which take place at intervals corresponding to one and three years after the congress. Congresses feature original papers in all themes and fields related to color. Interim and Midterm Meetings, instead, are thematically oriented; each meeting concentrates on a specific aspect of color. The papers presented at congresses and meetings are published in the proceedings, most of which are freely available at their website.  Members and Executive Committee  The regular members of the AIC are color associations of different countries or regions. In addition, it has individual members (persons), and associate members (other related international societies). The executive committee of the AIC is made of seven persons: a president, a vice president, a secretary/treasurer, and four ordinary members.

History Fortifications probably existed at Bucu by the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 8th century. When the Christian Obotrite prince Gottschalk was killed at Lenzen in 1066, the pagan Kruto took control of Wagria and made it his base of power. Kruto neglected the developing settlement of Liubice and instead developed Bucu between the Trave and the Wakenitz; Gottschalk's son Henry made Liubice the Obotrite capital after killing Kruto in 1093, however. With the death of Henry in 1127 and the Rani sack of Liubice the following year, Bucu began to assume greater importance as merchants moved to the fortified hill. Count Adolf II of Holstein founded L√ºbeck in 1143 near the castle, which offered protection to the new harbour settlement. Excavation Bucu was excavated by archaeologists in the 1970s. Recovery excavations at the Kleine Gr√∂pelgrube unearthed a nearby settlement, the suburbium, in 1997. The exposed findings indicate that the region east of the castle was inhabited by Slavs from the 8th or 9th century until the middle of the 12th century. In a southern section of the current Gro√üe Burgstra√üe, a 3.5 m wide and 2.5 m deep trench protected the settlement. The northern border was presumably north of the current K√∂nigstra√üe. To the west the settlement bordered the castle directly, while to the east it reached the Wakenitz. The settlement area was probably about 6 ha. Discoveries in the interior include mines, mining houses, hearths, and a great number of ceramic objects. The remnants of a potter's workshop were found in the Kleine Gr√∂pelgrube. A Slavic pottery tradition could have existed at the location until the arrival of Saxons in the 12th century. The Kleine Gr√∂pelgrube was first mentioned in 1297 as parva platea lutifigulorum, or the small street of the loam potters.

The series is narrated by Art Gilmore, and was produced by Ziv Television Programs. Synopsis Carlson played Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie, commander of the U.S. 4th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Clark near Brackettville in Kinney County in southwest Texas, during the 1870s. The real Mackenzie was a nephew of Confederate States of America diplomat John Slidell and the brother of Union Navy Lieutenant Commander Alexander Slidell MacKenzie. In the series story line, Colonel Mackenzie receives secret orders from U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and Secretary of War William W. Belknap to stop bandits from crossing the Rio Grande into the United States or from returning to Mexico. According to screenwriter Warren Douglas, Richard Carlson, who held a Master of Arts degree from the University of Minnesota, perceived himself to be \\"rather superior intellectually and culturally to most of his peers ... and he was.\\" Following service in the United States Navy during World War II Carlson continued his acting career.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 112-113 Each episode begins with a standard introduction from Art Gilmore, slightly edited here: \\"From the archives of the United States Cavalry, the true story of Colonel Ranald Mackenzie and the Cavalrymen he led - Mackenzie's Raiders. His secret orders from the President of the United States - clean up the Southwest ... make it a fit place for Americans to live ... wipe out renegades, outlaws, and murderers. If necessary cross the Rio Grande, knowing capture means hanging by the enemy ... discovery, court martial by the United States Army\\". The series is based on the 1955 book The Mackenzie Raid by Colonel Russell \\"Red\\" Reeder. Cavalry raids into Mexico during the 1870s meant risking international incident, but under secret orders from President Grant, Mackenzie pursued marauding bandits, gun runners, and renegade Apache. If caught he knew he would be left without support by his own government. Each episode ends with Gilmore narrating: \\"Mackenzie's Raiders did ride again ... and again, carrying out the secret orders of the President ... [to] do whatever necessary to make [the Southwest] a decent place to live.\\" Several mostly unknown actors played various \\"raiders\\" or officers, including the former attorney and economics professor Morris Ankrum, the former journalist Louis Jean Heydt, Brett King, and Jack Ging.

Marriage In Madrid on 25 August 1856 he married Infanta Amalia of Spain (1834‚Äì1905), sister of King-Consort Francis, Duke of C√°diz, sixth daughter and eleventh child of Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain (a younger son of King Charles IV of Spain) and Princess Luisa Carlotta of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.

Death Prince Adalbert of Bavaria died on 21 September 1875 (the same day as his sister Alexandra) in Munich and is buried in the Colombarium in the Michaelskirche in Munich, Bavaria. Greek succession It is often suggested that following his older brother Otto's death, Prince Adalbert became the heir presumptive to the throne of Greece. In fact, rights to the Greek succession were passed onto his other older brother Luitpold, who technically succeeded to the Greek throne in 1867. Due to the renunciation of all the rights to the Greek succession by King Ludwig III, at Luitpold's death the rights to the throne of Greece were inherited by his second son, Prince Leopold. However, if it is proven that all legitimate descendants of Luitpold (barring those through King Ludwig III) are indeed extinct (discounting also the male descendants of prince Georg of Bavaria), Adalbert's male-line descendants could conceivably assume the claim to the throne of Greece.

It was part of a series of high-profile concerts organised by Kevin Wall, which took place across the globe to raise awareness about climate change. Jonas Lauren Norr of Ethos Investments was responsible for the collaboration of Live Earth with the Heptavium concert as a producer of the event. The concert was masterminded and written by composer and researcher of philosophy Michael I.D'Alessandra. The concert was officially backed by the Vatican, thus being the Catholic Church's autonomous presence at the Live Earth events.  Heptavium/Live Earth: The Concert St. John Lateran's pipe organ The Heptavium/Live Earth event was inaugurated by Paul Cardinal Poupard, who explained the scope and meaning of the evening, a prelude to the Cathedralia Project, an endeavour of original sacred music between Rome and the USA, conceived and composed by D'Alessandra and planned for the next decade. A reading of a page from St. Augustine's \\"City of God\\" followed, mentioning the sacred aspect of earthly nature, concluded by an intervention on behalf of the Live Earth event by acclaimed film producer Lawrence Bender. The concert was performed exclusively in two different locations of the Cathedral of Rome: before its Holy Door, and inside the Cathedral, in the central nave. During the first part of the concert, various works for string quartet and grand piano composed by M¬∞ Michael D'Alessandra were performed by the Bernini Quartet, a string ensemble of virtuosos from Rome, and D'Alessandra, a piano virtuoso and organist himself; the performance was shown inside the Church through HD screens placed aside the Church's canopy. M¬∞ Michael D'AlessandraThe second part of the concert, consisting of symphonic and choral sacred music, saw the deployment of the largest orchestra the Church had ever experienced. Performing were the London Oratory School Schola, Michael D'Alessandra, The Rome Philharmonic Orchestra and M¬∞Cristiano Serino. The choir and orchestra performed Vexilla Regis, a variation on Franz Liszt's Via Crucis conducted by Michael D'Alessandra, connected to Septem postrema verba, a concerto for choir, orchestra and cello solo written by M¬∞Cristiano Serino conducting it. The last seven words of Jesus Christ on the cross were utilised for the libretto, culminating towards the core of the concert: D'Alessandra's Missa Sylvestri II, a funeral Mass, beginning with an eerie Kyrie Eleison progressing to a fast-paced Sanctus, through a solemn Benedictus, reminiscent of German baroque progressions and Russian Orthodox melodies, and concluding with an elegiac Agnus Dei. This funeral Mass, regarded as a masterpiece of new sacred music in Vatican cultural circles, was written for the 1000th anniversary of Pope Sylvester II's death (May 12, 1003) and premiered in the year 2003 in the very Cathedral of Rome, where Sylvester II is buried. The last performance, Gloria, a piece endowed with Wagnerian traits uttered a finale in which, D'Alessandra conducting, 140 musicians and singers reached the acme of their performance. This ceremonial concert coincided with the issuance of the motu proprio, Summorum Pontificum relating to the traditional Latin Mass, also on 7 July 2007. Heptavium/Live Earth in the media The concert was broadcast either in full or in part by many television and radio networks. The concert was broadcast in Italy, America, Australia and New Zealand, and a short clip showing D'Alessandra's funeral Kyrie Eleison was also shown on BBC One in the UK, along with Live Earth's world feed, thus honouring the British choir performing in Rome, in remembrance of the victims fallen on the terrorist attacks in London on 7 July 2005, a tragedy mentioned also during Card. Poupard's introduction to the event. Articles about the concert also appeared in The Tablet and The Catholic Herald. The fact that a performance of original sacred music of such elevated standards connected the \\"Mother of all Churches\\" (as the Cathedral of Rome is also called) to an event featuring iconic rock acts like Metallica or The Police, denotes a surprising dynamism of certain Vatican departments, although remaining conservative, thus representing a promising breakthrough for the dialogue of a sensible Roman Catholic world with secularized modernity, and overall, with contemporary global culture. The Heptavium symbolism Heptavium (literally meaning 'place where seven ways meet') is a Latin neologism conceived by D'Alessandra, who, beside being a musician has an extensive background in Vatican universities and institutes as a researcher. This new word aims at condensing in one concept the Arts of the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and quadrivium (mathematics, geometry, astronomy, music), the body known as the seven Liberal Arts, as taught in the Cathedral schools and Universities during the Middle Ages.Allegory of the Seven Liberal Arts by Maerten de Vos (1590)The city of Rome has always been connected to the number seven since its very foundation: built on seven hills, ruled by seven kings, and furthermore enriched by seven churches and by the seven sacraments, the rhythm of Rome and its symbolism has been and is being governed numerically by the number 7 during its pagan imperial rule and since it became the cradle of Christianity. Therefore, Heptavium may become an esoteric nomen secretum, a secret name for Rome itself, literally the \\"City where seven ways meet\\". These concepts and prerogatives were mentioned during Card. Paul Poupard's introductory speech to the concert, linking the symbolical contents directly to the music performed. Moreover, the Heptavium concert was performed both outside and inside the Church, and with two different repertoires and styles of music, profane and sacred-symphonic, to stress the transition from the pagan sphere to the one divinely inspired that the city of Rome has been experiencing for over two millennia. However, the reason why the date 7 July 2007 was chosen by Pope Benedict XVI as the date for the release of a Motu Proprio related to the traditional Latin Mass, as the date 7 July reflects the number 7 as the Roman number, the Spirit of the Latin Mass canonized by Pope Pius V. Undeniably, this number holds great significance in the Western symbolic tradition and numerology; nevertheless, the importance of a Motu Proprio aiming at reintroducing liturgical functions in Latin for the Church of Rome, weighed on D'Alessandra's decision to utilise exclusively Latin for the Heptavium concert's libretto, stressing Heptavium's alignment to the symbolical orientation of the current pontificate. This original liturgical music in Latin and a Latin neologism with a concept related to Rome paid homage to the city's Cathedral and seat of the Papal authority, ranking even higher than Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican and any other Roman Catholic church in the world in terms of canonical primacy. As a resultance of these two occurrences combined, namely: I) the Heptavium/Live Earth concert, II) the promulgation of Summorum Pontificum, 7 July 2007 may from now on be defined as the Heptavium Dies, the Heptavium Day for the Roman Catholic Church and its future approach to the city of Rome in the contemporary artistic scenario. 1 https://web.archive.org/web/20070904055147/http://www.radiovaticana.org/ung/Articolo.asp?c=144233 2 https://web.archive.org/web/20091015212228/http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/features/f0000279.shtml 3 https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben- xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum.html External links *Basilica of St.John Lateran *Pope Sylvester II *Pontifical Council for Culture Rome Category:2007 in Italian music Category:Rock festivals in Italy Category:Music festivals in Italy Category:2000s in Rome Category:Music in Rome Category:July 2007 events in Europe Category:Events in Rome ","title":"Live Earth concert, Rome"},{"id":"13358533","text":"Eleven ships of the French Navy have borne the name Foudroyant (\\"Lightning\\"): * , a 70-gun ship of the line * , an 82-gun ship of the line * Foudroyant, renamed Soleil-Royal in 1693 * , a 104-gun ship of the line * , a 110-gun ship of the line * (1751), an 80-gun ship of the line which in 1758 was captured by the British Navy, becoming * (1799), an 80-gun ship of the line * a prame (a vessel propelled by oars and sails) of 12 guns of 24 poundsl'Amiral Baudin by Vice Amiral Jurien de la Graviers * , a central battery and barbette battleship of the Redoutable type * , a L'Adroit-class destroyer * a launched in 1938 as Fleuret and renamed in 1941; she was scuttled in 1942 * (S610), a ballistic missile submarine of the Redoutable type Also, , originally French ship Duguay-Trouin, was renamed Foudroyant before being scuttled.

There are three choral groups including Mixed Choir, Treble Choir, and Varsity Choir. Mixed Choir is open to any student, while Treble choir and Varsity Choir are open to students by audition. Johnsburg High School also has a Madrigal Ensemble that performs a Madrigal Dinner annually. The band program includes two percussion ensembles, jazz ensemble, concert band and marching band (The wind ensemble was eliminated in 2012 due to low enrollment). The marching band is mandatory for any student enrolled in any instrumental ensemble. The Johnsburg Marching Skyhawks march at every home football game, as well as competitions and parades throughout northern Illinois. Theatre Johnsburg High School has a theatre program that is extracurricular. Three teachers from the school run the drama program, though many aspects of the program are student-led, as many positions and duties revolving around each theatrical production are fulfilled by students. There are about 50 members active in different aspects of each production, including acting, set construction, technical aspects, and many other roles. The program has been chosen several times to perform at the Illinois High School A variety of different plays are chosen to be produced in the fall and spring; a musical is typically reserved to be performed in the winter. The shows usually run one or two weekends and make enough money to support the next play.

These methods have primarily been developed to study human populations, but are extended to a variety of areas where researchers want to know how populations of social actors can change across time through processes of birth, death, and migration. In the context of human biological populations, demographic analysis uses administrative records to develop an independent estimate of the population. Demographic analysis estimates are often considered a reliable standard for judging the accuracy of the census information gathered at any time. In the labor force, demographic analysis is used to estimate sizes and flows of populations of workers; in population ecology the focus is on the birth, death, migration and immigration of individuals in a population of living organisms, alternatively, in social human sciences could involve movement of firms and institutional forms. Demographic analysis is used in a wide variety of contexts. For example, it is often used in business plans, to describe the population connected to the geographic location of the business. Demographic analysis is usually abbreviated as DA. For the 2010 U.S. Census, The U.S. Census Bureau has expanded its DA categories. Also as part of the 2010 U.S. Census, DA now also includes comparative analysis between independent housing estimates, and census address lists at different key time points. Introduction Demography is the statistical and mathematical study of the size, composition, and spatial distribution of human populations and how these features change over time. Data are obtained from a census of the population and from registries: records of events like birth, deaths, migrations, marriages, divorces, diseases, and employment. To do this, there needs to be an understanding of how they are calculated and the questions they answer which are included in these four concepts: population change, standardization of population numbers, the demographic bookkeeping equation, and population composition. Population change Population change is analyzed by measuring the change between one population size to another. Global population continues to rise, which makes population change an essential component to demographics. This is calculated by taking one population size minus the population size in an earlier census. The best way of measuring population change is using the intercensal percentage change. The intercensal percentage change is the absolute change in population between the censuses divided by the population size in the earlier census. Next, multiply this a hundredfold to receive a percentage. When this statistic is achieved, the population growth between two or more nations that differ in size, can be accurately measured and examined. Standardization (of population numbers) For there to be a significant comparison, numbers must be altered for the size of the population that is under study. For example, the fertility rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of births to women of childbearing age to the total number of women in this age range. If these adjustments were not made, we would not know if a nation with a higher rate of births or deaths has a population with more women of childbearing age or more births per eligible woman. Within the category of standardization, there are two major approaches: direct standardization and indirect standardization. Direct standardization Direct standardization is able to be used when the population being studied is large enough for age-specific rate is stable. Indirect standardization Indirect standardization is used when a population is small enough that the number of events (births, deaths, etc.) are also small. In this case, methods must be used to produce a standardized mortality rate (SMR) or standardized incidence rate (SIR).examples of standardization Demographic bookkeeping (or balancing) equation Demographic bookkeeping is used in the identification of four main components of population growth during any given time interval. The demographic bookkeeping equation is as follows: : P_2 = P_1 + (B-D) + (M_i - M_o) \\\\, The four components being studied by this equation are population growth (P1, P2), Births (B), Deaths (D), and in- (Mi) and out- (Mo) migration. Meaning, the population at any time is equal to the earlier population plus the excess of births over deaths in the time, plus the amount of in-migration minus the amount of out-migration. Population composition Population composition is the description of population defined by characteristics such as age, race, sex or marital status. These descriptions can be necessary for understanding the social dynamics from historical and comparative research. This data is often compared using a population pyramid. Population composition is also a very important part of historical research. Information ranging back hundreds of years is not always worthwhile, because the numbers of people for which data are available may not provide the information that is important (such as population size). Lack of information on the original data-collection procedures may prevent accurate evaluation of data quality. Demographic analysis in institutions and organizations=Labor market The demographic analysis of labor markets can be used to show slow population growth, population aging, and the increased importance of immigration. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that in the next 100 years, the United States will face some dramatic demographic changes. The population is expected to grow more slowly and age more rapidly than ever before and the nation will become a nation of immigrants. This influx is projected to rise over the next century as new immigrants and their children will account for over half the U.S. population. These demographic shifts could ignite major adjustments in the economy, more specifically, in labor markets. Turnover and in internal labor markets People decide to exit organizations for many reasons, such as, better jobs, dissatisfaction, and concerns within the family. The causes of turnover can be split into two separate factors, one linked with the culture of the organization, and the other relating to all other factors. People who do not fully accept a culture might leave voluntarily. Or, some individuals might leave because they fail to fit in and fail to change within a particular organization. Population ecology of organizations A basic definition of population ecology is a study of the distribution and abundance of organisms. As it relates to organizations and demography, organizations go through various liabilities to their continued survival. Hospitals, like all other large and complex organizations are impacted in the environment they work. For example, a study was done on the closure of acute care hospitals in Florida between a particular time. The study examined effect size, age, and niche density of these particular hospitals. A population theory says that organizational outcomes are mostly determined by environmental factors. Among several factors of the theory, there are four that apply to the hospital closure example: size, age, density of niches in which organizations operate, and density of niches in which organizations are established. =Business organizations= Problems in which demographers may be called upon to assist business organizations are when determining the best prospective location in an area of a branch store or service outlet, predicting the demand for a new product, and to analyze certain dynamics of a company's workforce. Choosing a new location for a branch of a bank, choosing the area in which to start a new supermarket, consulting a bank loan officer that a particular location would be a beneficial site to start a car wash, and determining what shopping area would be best to buy and be redeveloped in metropolis area are types of problems in which demographers can be called upon. Standardization is a useful demographic technique used in the analysis of a business. It can be used as an interpretive and analytic tool for the comparison of different markets. =Nonprofit organizations= These organizations have interests about the number and characteristics of their clients so they can maximize the sale of their products, their outlook on their influence, or the ends of their power, services, and beneficial works.
