It was built around 1795 during the period when this town was the capital of Georgia. It was entered into the National Register of Historic Places on February 17, 1978. The structure was built as a public market but was also sometimes used as a slave market. Amid the George Floyd protests in 2020, the city council of Louisville voted to have the structure removed from the town. History The Old Market is four-sided (24 feet each) open-air shed with a pyramid-shaped roof. There is a steeple at the top containing a bell. Four heavy wooden timbers support each side. A new roof and a cement floor were added to the structure in the 1950s, and the timbers (which are now badly rotted) were reinforced with iron. The structure sits midway on a mall in the middle of Broad Street, at the intersection of Mulberry Street. It is currently surrounded by a low brick wall and shrubbery, all of recent origin. The market was built sometime between 1795 and 1798, based on extant newspapers of the time and other historical records. It was originally constructed as a \\"market house\\" to be used for official sales such as property and furniture. However it was known to be used to sell slaves, and has commonly been called the \\"Slave Market\\" in recent years. Recent research casts doubt on the contention that it was used to sell slaves.Explore Georgia In June 2020 amid the George Floyd protests, a petition circulated in Louisville to have the Old Market removed from the town, which quickly gained 4,000 signatures. The town population is 2,500, about 30% of which are Black. On June 13, 2020 a protest took place in the town attended by hundreds of people, and one of their demands was that the market had to go. On August 11, 2020 the city council of Louisville voted four to one to remove the structure from the town's downtown area. The exact disposition of it has not yet been determined.

Early life and education Shelby Rosette was born and raised in Jasper, Texas to parents Cleveland Shelby and Lillie Faith Shelby. She earned her Bachelor in Business Administration degree and Master in Professional Accounting degree from the University of Texas at Austin before receiving her PhD in Management and Organizations from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. As a doctoral student, Shelby Rosette had the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant to Oprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham. Career Shelby Rosette began her career in academic after working as a Certified Public Accountant for Arthur Andersen. She accepted an Assistant professor position at University of Houston following her PhD, where she stayed until 2005 before joining the faculty at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. Prior to joining their faculty, Shelby Rosette consulted various current and former Duke faculty and administrators regarding concerns about the institutions \\"commitment to attracting underrepresented minority and women.\\" Upon accepting her placement, Shelby Rosette began examining the differences in leadership expectations in regards to race and gender in corporate position. One of her first research papers at Duke was on the topic of diversity in leadership, which found that the majority of Americans expected business leaders to be white and thought more highly of them. She said that due to the appointment of Barack Obama, \\"much of the feedback was not critical of the theory or of the analysis, but people doubted that the phenomenon mattered, that it was even relevant for organizational studies. A few years later, Shelby Rosette published a study which concluded that the negative stereotype surrounding women as \\"sensitive\\" often benefited those at the most senior levels of organizations. She came to this finding by having 323 graduate and undergraduate students review fictitious newspaper clippings and evaluate the male or female CEOs mentioned. Along with a graduate student, they found that students evaluated women CEOS more favorably than comparable male CEOs. As a result of her research, Shelby Rosette was ranked as one of the Forty Best Business School Professors under Forty by Poets & Quants and also received the Triangle Business Journal‚Äôs 40 Under 40 Leadership Award. In January 2012, Shelby Rosette and Andrew Carton from Pennsylvania State University began examining the differences in media representations of leadership between black and white college football quarterbacks. They found that oftentimes black college football quarterbacks were judged as less effective leaders than their white counterparts and when they won games, the media praised them for being great athletes rather than great leaders. That same year, she also co-published Failure is not an option for Black women: Effects of organizational performance on leaders with single versus dual- subordinate identities and Can an agentic Black woman get ahead? The impact of race and interpersonal dominance on perceptions of female leaders. In August 2020, Shelby Rosette was the lead author of a study that reaffirmed that Black women with natural hairstyles were less likely to get job interviews.

At the end of his term Duchesne went down to Boma on 22 June 1910, where he served as a judge for a month before embarking for Belgium on 21 July 1910. In Belgium he presented his thesis to qualify as a permanent member of the Congo judiciary. At the end of his leave he was appointed deputy judge at the court of first instance of Coquilhatville on 14 December 1910. He reached Boma on 13 January 1911 and in rapid succession was appointed substitute for the state prosecutor at the court of first instance of Boma and the Matadi territorial court (14 January 1911), then deputy state prosecutor at the court of first instance of Boma (13 February 1911). holding these offices concurrently. He had to deal with the Arnold case, a scandal. When the Arnold case was over, Duchesne went on to Coquilhatville, where he was deputy judge and deputy state prosecutor. He was instructed by Minister of Colonies Jules Renkin to assign the trial of the agents of the Belgian company for Commerce du Haut Congo, denounced in 1907 by Dr. D√∂rpinghaus, to one of his subordinates. Duchesne was recalled to Boma, where he had been appointed state prosecutor on 6 March 1912. On 20 February 1913 he was appointed deputy prosecutor general, and on 20 April 1913 was to the Kasa√Ø region to inquire into the Cambier affair. After this had been resolved, Duchesne went on leave on 8 August 1913. On 31 October 1913 Duchesne was appointed deputy attorney general at the Boma court of appeal. He assumed office in Boma on 25 January 1914. During this term Duceshne was sent on a mission of inspection to Haut- Congo, and in particular to Haut-Ituri, where problems included gold thefts from the state mines of Kilo and Moto, incursions from Uganda, and revolts by the local people. The tour took him through all of the Ituri mining region and a large part of the upper and lower Uele regions. Duchesne returned to Europe for statutory leave, leaving Boma on 20 September. He spent most of his leave in Bordeaux, but from time to time visited Minister Renkin in Sainte-Adresse, the administrative capital of Belgium during World War I (1914‚Äì1918). On 11 November 1917 Renkin appointed him Assistant Secretary General to the Governor general. Duchesne returned to Boma on 17 May 1918 and served as secretary general until 28 May 1919, when he was appointed acting commissioner general, assisting the Governor of the Orientale Province while the commissioner general F. V. A. Tombeur was on leave. Soon after he acted as governor of Orientale Province while Adolphe De Meulemeester was on leave, and received Colonial Minister Louis Franck in Stanleyville on an inspection and study trip. On 17 August 1919 he was discharged from the general secretariat and named an assistant commissioner general. After de Meulemeester returned from leave, Duchesne took over the government of √âquateur Province, which Alphonse Engels had just left. Governor Stamp of Belgian Congo; 1931; postmarked in Coquilhatville Duchesne was the first civilian governor of Equateur. He held office from 1921 to 1933, the longest of all the governors of √âquateur. He succeeded Alphonse Engels (1880‚Äì1962) as interim governor-general of √âquateur in 1921. Equateur was still a very poor province, rich in people and water, but poor in dry land that could be cultivated and poor in infrastructure. From 2‚Äì5 May 1921 Duchesne received Governor General Lippens, and discussed appeasement and compensation after the recent revolt of Mongo people, or related peoples, in the territories between Haute-Lukenie, Haute-Luilaka, Salonga, Lomela and the Block de la Busira grants to the Commerce du Haut- Congo company. The revolt highlighted the need to balance the interests of European enterprises who had acquired legal land rights and the local people, where the Congolese were the only available workers and also held immemorial rights to the land. Duchesne and his advisors developed and implemented a policy of \\"tripartite\\" contracts with ordinances of 1922, 1923 and 1927. Duchesne had issues with the schools run by the Trappists in the province. He wrote in a letter of 27 December 1921, \\"In general, [there are] few pupils, who rarely complete their studies.\\" He wrote of the Sisters who taught the girls, \\"Admirable for their dedication, that nevertheless achieves little success because the environment in which the girls live and the environment in which they will be called to live are not taken into account.\\" He wrote of the bush schools, \\"Established in villages, where a catechist teacher is supposed to teach ... in general he is almost illiterate, limits himself to teaching a few religious ideas to a few children and this no more than intermittently.\\" The Trappists in return accused Duchesne of removing many boys from school so they could work in farming, for the administration or for private enterprises. Duchesne went on leave, departing from Boma on 22 January 1922. His leave expired at the start of July 1922, but he remained in Belgium to discuss various issues with the governor general, who had also returned on leave. Between January and September 1922 the lawyer Georges-Jules-Pierre Van der Kerken (1888‚Äì1953) acted as interim governor-general. Soon after his return to Coquilhatville in September 1933 Duchesne received Minister of State Count Henry Carton de Wiart, who later criticised the drowsiness of the provincial capital. He received Governor General Lippens on his way to the Orientale Province and the Ueles. The former governor of Katanga, Martin Rutten, called while on his way to take the post of governor general after Lippens had resigned. In 1923 Attorney General De Heem visited, and in June 1924 the journalist Roger de Chatelux (\\"Chalux\\") of the Nation belge. In September 1924 Henri Carton de Tournai, the new Minister of Colonies visited, and met governors Duchesne, Adolphe De Meulemeester of Orientale and Alphonse Engels of Congo-Kasai. Duchesne made long journeys on foot or by canoe through the districts of Equateur. In 1923 he inspected the territories of Lisala, Modjamboli, Abumumbasi, Yakoma, Bosobolo, Bangi, Libenge, Gemena, Likimi and Nouvelle-Anvers. Soon after he went to meet de Meulemeester in Stanleyville and settled an exchange of populations with him to make both their territories more ethnically homogeneous. On 4 October 1924 Duchesne went on leave, deputizing Commissioner General W. E. Parker as acting governor. On 20 December 1924 he was formally named deputy governor general, governor of the Province of √âquateur. He left from Antwerp on 2 April 1925, arrived in Boma on 19 April 1925 and at once set off for Coquilhatville. During his sixth term in the Congo Duchesne began to see real improvements in the ports, roads, sanitation and urban infrastructure. His relations with the missionaries also improved. The Trappists of Westmalle had been replaced by a decision of the Pope by the Fathers of the Sacred Heart under Bishop . There were also Lazarists at Lake Tumba, Scheutists in Bangala and Lake Leopold II, Fathers of Mill Hill in Lulonga, Franciscans in Ubangi, and Protestant missions in Upoto, Bolenge, Lake Tumba and other locations. Eala botanical gardens Distinguished visitors included L√©opold of Belgium, Duke of Brabant, on 7 June 1925, who inspected troops and saw the sights accompanied by Duchesne. In September Coquilhatville was visited by Andr√© Gide, the filmmaker Marc All√©gret and the Duchess of Treviso, attach√© at the Pasteur Institute of Paris. Gide, in his Voyage au Congo, paid tribute to his hosts, admired the indigenous hospital that was nearing completions, and wrote of the achievements at the . The Duke of Brabant visited on his return trip on 30 October 1925. In August 1926 the former governor-general Lippens visited Coquilhatville and took part in a ceremony to inaugurate a Chamber of Commerce and the √âquateur Labor Exchange (Bourse du Travail de l'√âquateur). On 19 February 1927 Duchesne set up a committee, which he chaired, to coordinate raising and allocating funds for charitable purposes. On 1 December 1927 Duchesne left Boma on leave, reaching Antwerp on 17 December 1927. J. Jorissen acted for Duchesne in 1927‚Äì28 and again in 1929‚Äì1930. On 29 February 1928 Duchesne married Rachel Bagot in Uccle. They embarked for the Congo on 19 June 1928 and reached Banane on 5 July 1928. On 10 August 1928 Duchesne was host to King Albert and Queen Elisabeth, accompanied by Governor General Tilkens. They toured the town, the Force Publique camp, the workers camps, hospitals and missions, the Eala botanical garden and the Inganda and Wendji industrial facilities. They dined with the leading people of the city, attended mass at the Cathedral, and the next day flew to L√©opoldville. At this time the copal producers started to suffer from competition from synthetic copal. They pushed for higher output from their workers, and complained that the workers were becoming too arrogant, which they blamed on excessive leniency by the magistrates. The publicist and future statesmen visited the Congo at this time and passed through Coquilhatville. In his report he described the unrest caused by the conviction of a white man for violence against a native, and criticized efforts to persist in a market that was no longer viable. He approved of the conviction. On 12 November 1929 Duchesne moved to L√©opoldville to serve as acting governor general in the absence of Auguste Tilkens until 24 July 1930. He then went on leave, arriving in Antwerp on 9 September 1930. Although he was past retirement age, he was authorized by the minister to continue in office, returned to Banane on 27 February 1931 and went on Coquilhatville at once. During this period Commissioner General Jorissen was again in charge of Equateur. In 1931 there was an economic crisis in the Belgian Congo triggered by problems in Belgium, the primary market, and an overvalued currency, leading to reduced exports. The head tax (imp√¥t indig√®ne) increased, and villages were unable to pay it. The Dengese people in particular were influenced by millenarian cults that talked of driving out the Europeans. Duchesne responded with a limited police action, and by the end of February 1932 the crisis there was over. 32 Dengese suspects had been arrested, with seven held on murder charges, six for attempted murder and the remainder for sedition. Duchesne was prompted to look for a solution to the problem of price fluctuations, which the indigenous harvesters saw as attempts to infringe on their rights, and considered a price stabilization system. He also pushed forward construction or improvement of roads in the province, including a motor road from Lisala to Libenge inaugurated in 1932. The Duke of Brabant and Princess Astrid visited in February 1933. Duchesne left office on 24 March 1933 and was succeeded by J. Jorissen as Commissioner of the newly created Coquilhatville Province. Later years After his retirement Duchesne became involved in several businesses. He became chairman of the Soci√©t√© √©quatoriale congolaise Lulonga-Ikelemba, administrator of the Plantations de Lukolela, Kilo-Moto Gold Mines and Chemin de fer du Katanga, and Commissaire of the Soci√©t√© mini√®re de Bafwaboli. He was president of the Professional Union of Cocoa Planters of Congo. Duchesne died in Saint-Gilles, Belgium on 17 November 1945. There was an Avenue Duchesne in Mbandaka (formerly known as Coquilhatville), but since 1972 it was called Avenue Mobutu.

The comic began in 2011 and is ongoing.  Synopsis  Set in a small Pacific Northwest town, Monster Pulse follows four children who have 'body-monsters' ‚Äì spirits which turn an organ into an external, sentient monster. Bina, the main character, has her heart possessed by a spirit and become a friendly monster she calls Ayo. Other children have monsters from other organs: Abel's monster is formed of one of his eyes, Desmond's monster is his stomach, and Julie's monster her hair. A corporation called Shell unwittingly released the technology that caused this, and it seeks to control the power of these monsters. As of 2014, the comic was updating three times a week.  Themes and reviews  Writing for The Beat, Maggie Vicknair described Monster Pulse as \\"a really excellent and polished work of all-ages comics, with its focus on character development, beautiful art, and slight dark edge.\\" Vicknair said that the comic \\"pulls its influences very clearly from children‚Äôs television, especially cartoons from the 90‚Äôs onward\\", such as Digimon and Pokemon. Vicknair added that \\"there‚Äôs a real commitment to steady character development in Monster Pulse, which makes the comic a rich read. The characters are a diverse group of kids which create genuine conflict between them ‚Äì Julie‚Äôs earnest energy versus Abel‚Äôs grumpy stoicism. The children not only have to deal with crazy problems like 'oh no my stomach is now sentient' but more mundane and relatable problems like 'my parents don‚Äôt understand me.'\\" The A.V. Club's reviewer Caitlin Rosenburg said that \\"like a lot of the very best kids‚Äô programming, it‚Äôs full of sweetness without being cloying or unbelievable, and the lessons it tries to teach feel important without being heavy handed\\", and said that \\"Porter has created a world that has some serious depth and reality to it, despite the supernatural foundation of the plot. Each of the kids‚Äô monsters correlates to some part of their personality, and it‚Äôs fascinating to watch what happens as they grow into young adulthood and stare down the barrel of puberty and all that it entails.\\" On the artwork, Rosenburg said that the style \\"was for a long time sharp and sketchy, with loose lines and almost exclusively drawn in black and white. In later years, the linework has become firmer and smoother, and Porter has added moody color to her panels.\\" Io9's Lauren Davis, writing in 2011 shortly after the comic began, described Monster Pulse as \\"an intriguing, all-ages mystery\\" that \\"does a lovely job of balancing dynamic action sequences... with likeable character moments.\\" In a 2014 article Davis said that Monster Pulse deserved to be nominated for an Eisner Award. Splinter's Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the comic for reflecting multiple ethnicities. Author  Magnolia Porter is a writer and illustrator who has worked on other comics such as Bobwhite and Dracula Mystery Club, and has written for video games.

Life  Leila M√≠ccolis was born in 1947 in Rio de Janeiro's Tijuca neighborhood. She was an only child. M√≠ccolis graduated with a law degree in 1969 from the old Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Faculty of Law. She later received a master's in literature and literary theory from the Federal University in 2007, as well as a doctorate in literary theory. M√≠ccolis worked as a lawyer until 1977, when she decided to dedicate herself exclusively to literature. She published her first book of poems, Gaveta da Solid√£o, in 1965. In 1983 she began to write TV scripts, becoming the co-author of such telenovelas as Kananga do Jap√£o (1989) with Wilson Aguiar Filho and Barriga de Aluguel (1990) with Gl√≥ria Perez. In 1991 she founded with her fellow poet Urhacy Faustino the literary magazine Blocos, and they created the digital version Blocos Online eight years later. She has written and edited over 30 books of poetry and prose, as well as many TV, theater, and film scripts. She also taught telenovela writing courses at the Federal University beginning in 2005. While M√≠ccolis has publicly rejected labels on sexuality, saying \\"I wanted to question the division of women into lesbians and non-lesbians,\\" her work has included poetry on lesbian themes. Her poem \\"Teus Seios\\" was featured in the Grupo Gay da Bahia's first Gay Poetry of Brazil Contest in 1982. She was a vocal activist with the gay rights organization Grupo Au√™ in Rio in the 1970s and '80s, coordinating a precursor to the Encontro Brasileiro de Homossexuais (Brazilian Gathering of Homosexuals) in that city. Her poetry also deals with feminist themes and the rejection of traditional social roles and structures: \\"I am always revolted with the game of appearances and with the hypocrisy of the family relationship or the relationship of two people. And my poetry questions those imposed social roles that are manipulative and responsible for the internalization of submission, of castration, of guilt, and of low female esteem.\\" Her role as an activist and the Brazilian \\"patron saint of hippy pack rats,\\" as the Miami Herald once described her, included amassing a library of alternative newspapers, magazines, mimeographs, and posters from the era of Brazil's military dictatorship. She eventually sold the collection to the University of Miami, where it is available for researchers as the Leila M√≠ccolis Brazilian Alternative Press Collection.

The main forest road on Anticosti Island that starts from Port-Menier goes up this valley and cuts the river just south of Princeton Lake. Airport operations are the main economic activity in this valley.  Geography  The Trois Milles River has its source at Princeton Lake (length: ; altitude: ) located in the western part of Anticosti Island. Princeton Lake is fed by a stream (coming from the north).

He was founder of Frontier Industries in Buffalo, New York and was CEO of Houdaille Industries from 1955‚Äì1962 and Chairman of the Board from 1956‚Äì1964. A pioneer in the development of the automobile shock absorber, Peo invented the first thermostatically controlled shock absorber. He also invented one of the earliest air conditioners for use in automobiles. Early life Peo was born in Rochester, New York, the oldest of three sons of Julien Frederick Peo and Flora (VanSchaick) Peo. The Peo family had come to America from France in 1832 and settled in Jefferson County, New York. The French spelling of the family surname was Peillot. His father encouraged him to work creatively with his hands. He had a workshop with many valuable tools in the basement of their home on Richard Street, Rochester. He attended Rochester Public School No. 15 and The Mechanics Institute of Rochester where he graduated in 1915 with a mechanical engineering degree. Career After college, he went to Detroit, Michigan to gain experience in the automobile industry. In Detroit he worked for Oakland, Dodge and Ford Motor Companies. He became acquainted with Charles F. Kettering of General Motors, who he regarded as the greatest American inventor in the automotive field. He worked in the Detroit auto industry for nine years until 1924 when he relocated to Buffalo, New York to become the assistant chief engineer at the American Radiator Company. In October 1927 Henry Ford wrote to A.B. Schultz, president of the Houde Engineering Corporation of Buffalo, manufactures of Houdaille shock absorbers. Ford told Schultz that if he hired 30 year old Peo to supervise production at the Buffalo plant, then Ford would install Houdaille shock absorbers on every Ford automobile manufactured. Houde Engineering was acquired by the Houdaille-Hershey Corporaton and Peo became Executive Vice President of Houdaille-Hershey and president of the Buffalo Division. During World War II he continued to manage the Buffalo Houdaille operations as well as the Buffalo Arms, Incorporated, a newly formed subsidiary of Houdaille- Hershey, which manufactured machine guns. He was known to be a production genius. His motto was \\"get it done\\". After WWII, he resigned from Houdaille and formed Frontier Industries by putting together a group of four diversified manufacturing companies, Buffalo Arms, Buffalo Crushed Stone, Fairmount Tool and Forging Company of Cleveland, Ohio, and Manzel Brothers, manufactures of lubricating machines. In 1955 Frontier Industries merged with Detroit-based Houdaille-Hershey. Peo became CEO, the corporate name was changed to Houdaille Industries and the corporate headquarters was moved to Buffalo. By the end of 1961 Peo had developed Houdaille into a national business leader in the construction materials, automotive parts, and industrial tools & machinery industries with over $80 million in annual sales, over 60 business locations in the United States and Canada and 9,783 shareholders. Peo retired as CEO in 1962 and continued as Chairman of the Board until 1964, when he became Chairman Emeritus. Personal life Peo was an avid gardener. At one time he cultivated over 100,000 tulips in his garden at his Buffalo home. He also had a life long passion for boating. In his youth he would paddle a small boat along the shores of Lake Ontario, near Rochester, and sing to onlookeers to earn spending money. As an adult, he purchased larger watercraft, the largest, a 60 foot yacht named HI Lady (for Houdaille Industries). Later in life he owned a 50+ foot Hatteras yacht named the BarBeth IV (for his daughters). In 1917 Peo married Magdeline Heath who died in 1942 at age 48. They had one son, Jack Heath Peo (1919‚Äì1968). In 1943 he married Ethelmay Brent (1909‚Äì1971) and they had two daughters. He died in Buffalo on November 29, 1966.

She was a large cruiser submarine that entered service in 1935 and served in World War II. She operated in support of the attack on Pearl Harbor, conducted anti-shipping patrols in the Indian Ocean, supported the Indian Ocean raid, and took part in the Guadalcanal campaign and the Aleutian Islands campaign. She was wrecked in the Aleutian Islands after a lengthy battle with the destroyer in June 1943..  Design, construction, and commissioning  I-7 was the first of two Junsen III- (or \\"J3\\"-) type submarines. After the four Junsen I-type submarines (, , , and ), the Japanese had built as a modified Junsen I, introducing an aviation capability to the Junsen type with the inclusion of a hangar that allowed I-5 to carry and operate a floatplane. I-6, the only Junsen II-type submarine, represented the next step in the evolution of this aviation capability, as she had both a hangar and a catapult for a floatplane. The Japanese designed and equipped the next and last Junsen type submarines, I-7 and ‚Äî the only two Junsen III-type submarines ‚Äî to operate as submarine squadron flagships.Boyd and Yoshida, p. 22. In them, the Japanese sought to combine what they viewed as the best features of the earlier Junsen-type submarines with those of the Kaidai V-type submarines. Like I-6 before them, I-7 and I-8 had a hangar and catapult for a floatplane. They were the last Japanese submarines with aircraft facilities abaft the conning tower; all later Japanese submarines with aircraft capabilities had their hangars and catapults on their forward decks.Boyd and Yoshida, p. 23. Built by Kure Navy Yard at Kure, Japan, I-7 was laid down on 12 September 1934. She was launched on 3 July 1935 and was completed and commissioned on 31 March 1937.  Service history = Pre-World War II  Upon commissioning, I-7 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District. She was assigned to Submarine Squadron 2 in the 6th Fleet on 15 November 1940. While taking part in maneuvers in Saeki Bay on the morning of 21 October 1941, she collided with the submarine I-66. Both submarines suffered light damage. On 10 November 1941 ‚Äî by which time I-7 was serving in the 6th Fleet as flagship of Submarine Squadron 2 and was assigned to Submarine Division 8 with the submarines , , and . ‚Äî the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Mitsumi Shimizu, gathered the commanding officers of the fleet‚Ä≤s submarines together for a meeting aboard his flagship, the light cruiser , which was anchored in Saeki Bay. Shimizu briefed them on the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor, which would bring Japan and the United States into World War II. On 11 November 1941, I-7 was reassigned to the Submarine Advance Force. As the Imperial Japanese Navy began to deploy on 16 November 1941 for the upcoming conflict in the Pacific, I-7 embarked both the commander of Submarine Squadron 2 and a Watanabe E9W1 (Allied reporting name \\"Slim\\") reconnaissance seaplane. At 13:00 that day, I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 got underway from Yokosuka bound for the Hawaiian Islands. While north of Oahu, I-7 received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii.  World War II  First war patrol = On 7 December 1941, the submarines of Submarine Squadron 2 took up patrol stations across a stretch of the Pacific Ocean from northeast to northwest of Oahu, with I-7 operating as their flagship. The submarines had orders to conduct reconnaissance in the area and attack any ships which sortied from Pearl Harbor during or after the attack, which occurred that morning. On 10 December 1941, Katori transmitted a message from Shimizu to the squadron commander ordering I-7‚Ä≤s floatplane to conduct a reconnaissance flight over Pearl Harbor to report on damage inflicted during the attack three days earlier and the progress the Americans were making on repairs. Accordingly, I-7 launched her floatplane early on the morning of 16 December 1941 from a position west of Kailua-Kona on the island of Hawaii. At 07:10, the floatplane‚Ä≤s observer reported four battleships ‚Äî one of them heavily damaged ‚Äî and an aircraft carrier in Pearl Harbor off the East Loch anchorage and five cruisers and 30 smaller vessels including three destroyers in the harbor south of Ford Island. The floatplane returned to I-7 and landed next to her at 09:45 and, after its two-man crew abandoned the plane and swam to the submarine, I-7 scuttled the plane, submerged, and left the area. On 17 December 1941, I-7 received orders to move to an operating area southwest of Oahu to support a sweep line by Submarine Squadron 2. Detached from that duty on 21 December 1941, she shifted to a patrol area southeast of Oahu. While southeast of Oahu on 1 January 1942, I-7 sighted a light cruiser and two destroyers steaming toward Pearl Harbor and fired two torpedoes at them, both of which missed. The destroyers counterattacked, dropping six depth charges, but I-7 escaped unscathed. On 9 January 1942, the submarine reported sighting the aircraft carrier northeast of Johnston Island, and I-7 diverted from her patrol to take part in the hunt for Lexington, but failed to find her. She then headed for Kwajalein, which she reached on 22 January 1942. She got back underway on 24 January 1942 bound for Yokosuka, which she reached on 2 February 1942. = Second war patrol = While I-7 was at Yokosuka, Submarine Squadron 2 ‚Äî consisting of I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 ‚Äî was assigned to the Dutch East Indies Invasion Force in the Southeast Area Force on 8 February 1942, operating as Submarine Group C with I-7 designated the group‚Ä≤s flagship. I-7 departed Yokosuka on 11 February 1942 bound for Palau, which she reached on 16 February, then got back underway on 17 February 1942 for the Netherlands East Indies. She arrived at Staring Bay on the Southeast Peninsula of Celebes just southeast of Kendari on 21 February 1942. At 06:00 local time on 23 February 1942, she began her second war patrol with the commander of Submarine Group C embarked, bound for a patrol area in the Indian Ocean south of Java. I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 formed a sweep line south of Java to interdict Allied shipping between Java and Australia, after which Submarine Group C patrolled south of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. At 12:30 on 2 March 1942, I-7 was operating in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Cocos Islands when an unidentified Japanese carrier aircraft attacked her by mistake. She suffered no damage. At 10:00 on 4 March 1942, she surfaced in the Indian Ocean northwest of the Cocos Islands and opened fire with her deck guns on the Dutch 865-ton motor vessel , a merchant ship on a voyage from Tjilatjap, Java, to Colombo, Ceylon, with a cargo of rubber. Merkus‚Ä≤s crew abandoned ship without loss of life, after which I-7 sank the ship with gunfire at . She concluded her patrol with her arrival at Penang in Japanese- occupied British Malaya on 8 March 1942. = Indian Ocean raid = Orders arrived from the headquarters of the Combined Fleet for all the submarines of Submarine Squadron 2 except for I-1 to conduct reconnaissance operations along the coast of Ceylon and western coast of India in preparation for Operation C, the upcoming Indian Ocean raid by the aircraft carriers of the Combined Fleet‚Ä≤s Mobile Force. Accordingly, I-7 departed Penang at 16:00 local time on 28 March 1942 with a Watanabe E9W1 (Allied reporting name \\"Slim\\") floatplane embarked. She was tasked to use the aircraft to conduct a reconnaissance of Colombo and Trincomalee, Ceylon, on 3 April 1942, two days before the scheduled Japanese carrier air strikes there. At 05:17 on 1 April 1942, a Royal Air Force Catalina I flying boat, probably from No. 201 Squadron, attacked I-7 while she was on the surface in the Indian Ocean southeast of Ceylon. The Catalina dropped two bombs which landed close aboard, but I-7 suffered no damage. Four hours later she encountered several small Allied patrol vessels in the same area, and her commanding officer decided to cancel the reconnaissance flight scheduled for 3 April because of the enemy activity in the launch area. Instead, I-7 provided weather reports to the approaching Mobile Force. At 03:40 on 3 April 1942, I-7 attacked the British 9,415-ton motor vessel in the Indian Ocean east of the Maldive Islands. I-7 fired two Type 89 torpedoes at Glenshiel, which was on a voyage from Bombay, India, to Fremantle, Australia, carrying 12 passengers and 1,000 tons of general cargo. One torpedo hit Glenshiel on her port side, and she began to settle by the stern. Glenshiel transmitted a distress signal and her crew and passengers ‚Äî all of whom survived ‚Äî abandoned ship. After waiting for the lifeboats to clear the ship, I-7 fired two more torpedoes, one of which hit. She then surfaced and opened fire on the ship with her deck guns, scoring 20 shell hits before the burning Glenshiel sank by the stern at . Reassigned to the Advance Force on 10 April 1942, I-7 arrived at Singapore along with I-3 on 15 April 1942. She got back underway on 21 April 1942 and arrived at Yokosuka on 1 May 1942 to undergo repairs. = Third war patrol = While I-7 was at Yokosuka, the Aleutian Islands campaign began on 3‚Äì4 June 1942 with a Japanese air raid on Dutch Harbor, Alaska, followed quickly by the unopposed Japanese occupation in the Aleutian Islands of Attu on 5 June and Kiska on 7 June 1942. On 10 June 1942, I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-5, I-6, and I-7 were reassigned to the Northern Force for duty in the Aleutians, and on 11 June 1942 I-7 set out for Aleutian waters to begin her third war patrol. She joined the \\"K\\" patrol line and patrolled off Unalaska Island. She was in the Gulf of Alaska on 14 July 1942 when she torpedoed the 2,722-ton United States Army Transport , which was on a voyage from Bethel, Alaska, to Seattle, Washington.wrecksite.eu SS Arcata (+1942) She then attacked Arcata with gunfire, her gun crew finding accuracy difficult in the choppy seas. After one of I-7‚Ä≤s shells hit Arcata‚Ä≤s bridge, her passengers and crew abandoned ship. Seven members of Arcata‚Ä≤s crew were killed. Japanese records claim I-7 ceased fire when she spotted life rafts in the water, while Arcata‚Ä≤s survivors reported that I-7 machine-gunned the life rafts, killing one crewman. Arcata sank at . I-7 was assigned to the Advance Force on 20 July 1942. Her patrol ended with her arrival on 1 August 1942 at Yokosuka, where she began an overhaul. = Fourth war patrol = During I-7‚Ä≤s stay at Yokosuka, the Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942 with U.S. amphibious landings on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, Gavutu, and Tanambogo in the southeastern Solomon Islands. On 20 August 1942, Submarine Squadron 2 was disbanded and I-7 was assigned directly to 6th Fleet headquarters. She was again reassigned, to Submarine Division 7, on 31 August 1942. With the commander of Submarine Division 7 and a Watanabe E9W1 (Allied reporting name \\"Slim\\") floatplane embarked, she departed Yokosuka on 8 September 1942 bound for Truk, which she reached on 15 September 1942. Upon arrival there, she was assigned to the 1st Picket Unit. With the commander of Submarine Division 7 still aboard, she got back underway on 19 September 1942 to begin her fourth war patrol, assigned a patrol line southeast of San Cristobal in the Solomon Islands. On 10 October 1942, I-7 was diverted from her patrol to conduct a reconnaissance of Espiritu Santo prior to a planned raid there by a Special Landing Unit put ashore by I-1. On 13 October 1942, her floatplane made a reconnaissance flight over Espiritu Santo, reporting two light cruisers, seven transports, several smaller vessels, and seaplanes off the island‚Ä≤s south coast. I-7 bombarded Espiritu Santo after dark on 14 October 1942, firing fourteen rounds. Before sunrise on 23 October 1942 she again bombarded the island, but fired only six rounds before return fire by coastal artillery forced her to submerge. On 24 October 1942 I-7 was ordered to return to rejoin the \\"A\\" patrol group southeast of Guadalcanal, but she again received orders on 31 October 1942 to launch a reconnaissance flight over Espiritu Santo. Her floatplane was damaged and could not carry out the flight, but I-7 did conduct a periscope reconnaissance of Espiritu Santo on 7 November 1942. After the submarine , carrying a Yokosuka E14Y1 (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") floatplane, relieved her off Espiritu Santo, I-7 received orders on 9 November 1942 to reconnoiter Ndeni and Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz Islands. She conducted a periscope reconnaissance of Ndeni on 10 November 1942, finding nothing important, and her floatplane made a reconnaissance flight over Vanikoro on 11 November 1942. She then proceeded to Truk, which she reached on 18 November 1942. I-7 departed Truk on 24 November 1942. On 1 December 1942, she arrived at Yokosuka for an extended stay. = Aleutian Islands campaign = On 1 April 1943, Submarine Division 7 was reassigned to the 5th Fleet for service in the North Pacific. Tasked with running supplies and reinforcements to the isolated Japanese garrisons on Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, I-7 departed Yokosuka on 21 April 1943 with a cargo of food and ammunition bound for Kiska. She called at Kiska on 1 May 1943, unloaded her cargo, and got underway the same day for Attu, which she reached on 4 May 1943. Leaving Attu the same day, she stopped briefly at Paramushiro in the Kuril Islands on 8 May 1943, then proceeded to Yokosuka, arriving there on 12 May 1943. During her voyage, U.S. forces landed on Attu on 11 May 1943, beginning the Battle of Attu. With the commander of Submarine Division 7 embarked, I-7 departed Yokosuka on 18 May 1943 both to carry supplies to the Japanese forces fighting on Attu and conduct her fifth war patrol. By the time she arrived in the Attu area on 21 May 1943, the situation on Attu had deteriorated to the point that the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decided to abandon the garrison on Attu ‚Äî which American forces eventually annihilated, securing the island on 30 May 1943 ‚Äî and evacuate the isolated garrison on Kiska by submarine, with the evacuation to begin on 26 May 1943. On 24 May 1943, I-7 departed her patrol area off Attu to head for Kiska, and she received orders on 25 May 1943 confirming that decision. When she arrived off Kiska on 26 May 1943, she found the harbor under air attack. She waited at sea until 22:30, then entered the harbor and discharged a cargo of six tons of food, 13.2-mm, 8-mm, and 7.7-mm ammunition, and a radio beacon. After embarking 60 mostly sick and wounded passengers ‚Äî 49 naval personnel, seven Imperial Japanese Army personnel, and four paramilitary workers ‚Äî as well as 28 boxes containing the cremated remains of soldiers and four tons of spent shell cartridges, she put back to sea at 01:00 on 27 May 1943 and headed for Paramushiro, arriving there on 1 June 1943. The oiler refueled I-7 and the submarines , , , and on 2 June 1943. On 4 June 1943, I-7 got underway from Paramushiro for another supply run to Kiska. Calling there on 8 June 1943 along with the submarine , she unloaded nine tons of ammunition and 15 tons of food, embarked 101 passengers ‚Äî 42 naval personnel, 18 army personnel, and 41 paramilitary workers ‚Äî and began her return to Paramushiro, which she reached on 13 June 1943. I-7 once again embarked the commander of Submarine Division 7 for her next supply run, leaving Paramushiro at 16:00 on 15 June 1943. While she was at sea on 17 June, the commander of Submarine Squadron 1 issued a directive ordering I-7, I-34, and the submarines and to suspend their supply runs to Kiska and await further orders because of the grounding on 16 June 1943 of I-157 and recent attacks on Japanese submarines in the Aleutians by radar-equipped American destroyers. Submarine Squadron 1 directed I-2, I-157, and the submarine to determine the locations of the American ships. Under pressure from higher command to continue the supply and evacuation of Kiska,Boyd and Yoshida, pp. 118‚Äì119. Submarine Squadron 1 reversed its decision on 18 June 1943 and ordered the resumption of the submarine supply runs. On 19 June 1943, I-7 arrived off Kiska, but found Gertrude Cove in Vega Bay shrouded in dense fog. Her commanding officer decided to delay her attempt to land her cargo. = Loss = I-7 surfaced off Kiska approximately south of Vega Bay in heavy fog at 19:00 on 20 June 1943 and began an attempt to enter the anchorage at Gertrude Cove. The destroyer , patrolling off Bukhti Point, detected I-7 on radar at a range of and began to close the range. I-7 lacked radarBoyd and Yoshida, p. 119. and was unaware that Monaghan was in the vicinity until 19:20, when her sound operator reported hearing propeller noises to starboard, and I-7 began preparations to dive. At 19:30, Monaghan opened radar-directed gunfire south of the anchorage at a range of . Taken by surprise, I-7 prepared to crash-dive when her crew heard Monaghan‚Ä≤s first shot, but two shells immediately hit the starboard side of I-7‚Ä≤s conning tower, holing it and killing the submarine division commander, I-7‚Ä≤s commanding officer, navigation officer, and helmsman, and two of I-7‚Ä≤s non- commissioned officers. I-7‚Ä≤s communications officer was wounded. I-7‚Ä≤s torpedo officer took command. He ordered I-7 to remain on the surface, man her guns, and return fire. I-7 fired thirty rounds from her deck guns and 250 rounds from her machine guns. Her crew had left her aft ballast tanks open by mistake, causing her to flood, take on a heavy list, and become stern-heavy. At around 19:45 she ran aground at Bukhti Point. Her torpedo officer ordered her crew to abandon ship, and her paymaster destroyed her secret documents and smashed her coding machine, whose pieces he threw overboard. Meanwhile, a Japanese Daihatsu-class landing craft sent to unload cargo from I-7 arrived in the area and tried to contact I-7 in the thick fog by signal lamp but came under machine-gun fire from Monaghan and withdrew. Using a portable transmitter, I-7 contacted Japanese forces ashore on Kiska at 02:00 on 21 June 1943. Two Daihatsus arrived from Gertrude Cove with welding equipment, which I-7‚Ä≤s crew used to patch the hole in her conning tower. The Daihatsus also took aboard some of I-7‚Ä≤s cargo for delivery ashore. As acting commanding officer, the torpedo officer convened a meeting of surviving officers, who decided to make a high-speed run on the surface to Yokosuka, with a possible stop at Paramushiro. With her repairs complete at 18:45, I-7 entered Gertrude Cove by 19:00, unloaded the rest of her cargo and the bodies of deceased personnel and took aboard new code books. She got underway at midnight on 21/22 June 1943. Monaghan was patrolling in heavy fog south of Kiska when she again detected I-7 on radar at a range of at 00:35 on 22 June 1943. She closed the range, and at 01:30 opened radar-directed gunfire when I-7 was about south of Vega Bay. Again taking I-7 by surprise, Monaghan scored several hits, including on the port side of I-7‚Ä≤s conning tower, on her deck gun bulwark, and in her aft ballast tanks, killing her engineering officer and severely wounding her acting commanding officer. Her lookouts mistakenly reported her to be under fire from three different directions by three different ships. I-7‚Ä≤s gunnery officer, a lieutenant junior grade, took command and ordered her crew to return fire with her deck guns and machine guns, and I-7‚Ä≤s lookouts reported seeing a fire on one of the three ships they thought they had sighted. Monaghan ceased fire after 10 minutes. Monaghan resumed firing at 02:10, this time illuminating I-7 with star shells. At around 02:18, she scored a hit which disabled I-7‚Ä≤s steering engine, and I-7 began a wide turn to port back towards Kiska. Another hit detonated the ready-use ammunition for I-7‚Ä≤s deck guns, which started a small fire. The ventilation intakes for I-7‚Ä≤s diesel engines sucked in flames from the fire, threatening to set the galley and forward head ablaze. Two other hits breached the aft deck casing on I-7‚Ä≤s port side, causing flooding which resulted in the submarine taking on a 30-degree list. I-7‚Ä≤s crew suffered heavy casualties, and at 02:30, I-7‚Ä≤s acting commanding officer ordered her to return to Kiska. Monaghan soon broke off her pursuit of I-7 to avoid the danger of running aground off Kiska. I-7‚Ä≤s crew had fired seventy shells and about 2,000 rounds from her machine guns during her battle with Monaghan. In danger of sinking, she reported her damage and estimated time of arrival to the Japanese forces on Kiska at 03:10. At 03:15, she ran aground on the Twin Rocks off Vega Bay at . She sank quickly by the stern, trapping a number of men inside, and came to rest with the forward of her hull out of the water. She had lost 87 officers and men killed in combat with Monaghan or when she sank after running aground. A Daihatsu arrived at 06:30 and took off her 43 survivors. On 23 June 1943, a Daihatsu arrived on the scene, and divers from it attempted to retrieve the codebooks aboard I-7 when she sank. Her surviving crew members had last seen a bag containing the code books and other secret documents suspended on a ladder at her No. 3 after access hatch, but the divers were unable to locate the books. The Daihatsu then used demolition charges to scuttle I-7‚Ä≤s bow section. I-7 was stricken from the Navy list on 20 August 1943. Aftermath The Japanese completed the evacuation of Kiska on 28 July 1943, and on 15 August 1943 the Allies invaded the undefended island in Operation Cottage. On 26 August 1943, the U.S. Navy fleet tug arrived to investigate I-7‚Ä≤s wreck. Her divers found I-7‚Ä≤s wreck lying on its port side in of water. Although the conning tower was damaged, I-7‚Ä≤s number was visible on a tarpaulin on the conning tower‚Ä≤s side. On 7 September 1943, the U.S. Navy submarine rescue ship arrived and began diving operations on the wreck that lasted for a month. By the time the operations concluded in October 1943, seven divers had entered I-7‚Ä≤s wreck and recovered valuable intelligence documents from it.

It was north of ≈åwhango and south of Piriaka. It formally opened on 9 November 1908. The rails were laid south of Piriaka by May 1904 and a daily ballast train was running by October, which also carried passengers. Kakahi Bridge has five spans of and one of supplied by G. Fraser & Sons of Auckland, which delayed construction to the south. An island platform and shelter were built in 1907, extended to x in 1908, with a lobby, urinals and a storeroom, plus a x goods shed. A stockyard was added in 1912 and extended in 1945, but closed on 26 January 1971. The shelter was removed in 1958 and the building on 26 November 1966, though in 1968 a new x weatherboard, lean-to shelter was built for parcels and phones. The passing loop for 31 wagons was extended for 66 in 1937. Electric block tablet signalling was installed in 1913, a new type of exchanger installed in 1965 and Centralised Traffic Control started on 15 May 1967. An engine turning triangle was built in 1951/1952 south of the viaduct, but appears to have been disused by 1969. On Sunday 25 June 1978 Kakahi closed to all traffic, though the loop remains in use.  Incidents  From Piriaki, through Kakahi, to just south of ≈åwhango, the line climbs a hill on the west side of the Whanganui River, increasing to a maximum gradient of 1 in 50 on the ≈åwhango bank. As early as 1906 groynes were added to protect the line from the river and a cutting collapsed. In 1908 it was noted that the hill was slipping, engines were derailed in 1915 1925 and 1959, trains were delayed in 1918, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1933, 1939, 1940 and 1945 and a length of railway was realigned in 1923.

Located at the Plaza Mayor, it consists of a bronze statue of Count Pedro Ans√∫rez, founder of the town of Valladolid in the 11th century, topping off a stone pedestal with additional sculptural elements.  History and description  Predated by earlier failed attempts in the 19th century to erect a monument to the founder of the city, the project of the statue was entrusted in the early 20th century to Aurelio Carretero, who, having started works in January 1901, completed the cast in April 1901, using bronze donated by himself. Standing about 2.60 m high, the statue of the Count raises the banner of Castile with the right hand, while the left hand grabs the scrolls entitling him as Lord of Valladolid, while also leaning on the handle of a broadsword. The stone pedestal was designed by municipal architect . The bronze elements displayed on the sides of the pedestal (also a work by Carretero) include an allegory of history, a cartouche reading (\\"the city of Valladolid erects this monument to the memory of its protector and magnanimous benefactor Count D. Pedro Ans√∫rez. 12-13th centuries\\"), the arms of the city and two reliefs depicting episodes of the life of Ans√∫rez. It was unveiled on 31 December 1903. The monument was temporarily stored in the 1970s and the 1990s during reform works in the plaza.

The restaurant operates on the fifteenth floor of The Nines. Description The Meier & Frank Building in 2007 Departure is an Asian restaurant and bar on the fifteenth floor of The Nines, a hotel in downtown Portland's Meier & Frank Building. Portland Monthly describes the restaurant as \\"a lively hub for creative, ambitious pan-Asian cuisine, a spot where Oregon‚Äôs produce, meats, and seafood are transmuted into bold yet comforting dishes that sizzle and pop with the big, bright flavors of chile, lime, and ginger\\". The menu \\"encompasses China (spring rolls, siu mai, fried rice) Japan (edamame, sashimi, kushiyaki) and Korea (a good bibimbap, stirred table-side)\\", and offers vegetarian and vegan options. According to The Oregonian Michael Russell, Departure has a \\"Miami vibe\\" and \\"Asian- influenced\\" small plates. History Gregory Gourdet began serving as chef in 2010, when the \\"astro-sleek\\" restaurant \\"was better known for its bridge-and- tunnel singles scene than for its eats\\". Departure closed temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic, but reopened on August 13, 2020. Reception According to Portland Monthly, \\"Visiting the restaurant, with its Vegas-style decks and unparalleled views of the city, is an expensive but giddy-making surprise: it's as if you went into a dressing room to try on a pair of gaudy Ed Hardy jeans and came out clad in an Armani suit.\\" Michael Russell of The Oregonian wrote, \\"If you're interested in this kind of modern Asian fusion in Portland, you might be better off at Smallwares, Expatriate or The American Local, where the bill will be considerably lower.

The octagonal crypt contains six graves, said to belong to Sufi sheikhs but also speculated to be those of high-ranking Ottoman soldiers. A shrine cult has emerged around the tomb, where candles are lit and thin metal sleeves thrown in. Those seeking luck or holding vigil will often be found there. The graves once stretched all the way to the sports fields, but the gravestones were flattened into the current park by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia government after World War II. This fate also befell the graves on the western side of the Old Fortress near the Vojinoviƒá Tower. The oral recounting of shrine custodian Ajet Havarda holds that the tekke was built 200 years ago.

Although approximately half of the ecoregion is forested to some degree, most has at some point been cleared for agriculture or degraded by extraction of hardwoods. There are few protected areas.  Location and description  The coast in this ecoregion is a series of alluvial plains separated by ridges extending down from the Annamite Range on the west. The separating hills rise to 1,000 meters, and are typically granite or rhyolite. The region stretches for 750 km from Da Nang in the north to the edge of the Mekong River delta in the south, and averages about 50 km wide. Mean elevation is 200 meters.  Climate  The climate of ecoregion is Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (K√∂ppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year, and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, and is drier than the average month. Annual rainfall is less than 1,500 mm in most of the region, and as low as 800 mm.  Flora and fauna  Nearest the beach are extensive dunes of red sand, with woody thickets giving way to evergreen forest cover on coastal hills and higher elevations. Two endemic species of trees on these dunes are the critically endangered Hopea cordata and Shorea falcata. Where freshwater gathers at the base of the dunes there are communities of Phreatophytes (plants that maintain constant contact with ground water) that create forest cover up to 12 meters in height. At semi-arid higher elevations of the coastal slopes are forest and thicket stands that support other endemic species but are under human pressure.

It follows protagonists Brian Basco and Gina Timmins as they retell events from Runaway: A Road Adventure (2001) to a film producer interested in their life story. Along the way, the player plays minigames and searches for objects hidden in the game's environments. Hidden Runaway marked a departure for Pendulo, as it was the company's first casual game and first project outside the graphic adventure game genre. Hidden Runaway was developed during a difficult economic period for Pendulo, and the game was itself a commercial failure. It remained Pendulo's worst-selling title by 2016 and contributed to a financial decline at the company. Critical reviews for Hidden Runaway were \\"mixed or average\\", according to Metacritic. Following Hidden Runaway, Pendulo stopped releasing original games for several years, until it returned with Yesterday Origins in 2016. Gameplay and plot The player searches a backdrop for hidden objects, aided by the object list at the top of the screen. Hidden Runaway is a hidden object game. The player searches static backdrops for a series of objects concealed in the game world, as indicated by a list on the screen. Locating enough of these objects rewards the player with key items that enable progression through the story, via either their combination or their use on the environment. The key items needed to complete the player's goals are displayed at the start of each scene. Alongside its object-hunt gameplay, Hidden Runaway features optional minigame puzzle sequences, such as matching musical notes, piecing together a ripped ticket or playing a variant of Whac-A-Mole. Once completed, minigames may be replayed at any time. Hidden Runaways story retells the first half of Runaway: A Road Adventure, the debut game in the Runaway series. It is set after that game's events: protagonists Brian Basco and Gina Timmins have since fallen out with each other, but have been reunited by a film producer to recount their life story for the script of his new feature. This frame story progresses via cutscenes between gameplay sequences; gameplay occurs during flashbacks to moments from the first Runaway. The retelling concludes when Brian and Gina describe their arrival in Arizona's Hopi region. Afterward, the player encounters a minigame sequence and a teaser for Hidden Runaway 2, which was planned to continue the story. Development Following the release of Runaway: A Twist of Fate (2009), the Spanish company Pendulo Studios retired its Runaway franchise and chose to explore other projects, citing exhaustion with the series. Rafael Latiegui of Pendulo noted that \\"2‚Äì3 scripts\\" for Runaway 4 existed by 2011, but that no new entries were yet planned. However, mobile game publisher Bulkypix revealed a new installment under the name Hidden Runaway, developed by Pendulo, at the Game Developers Conference in March 2012. TouchArcade reported at the time that Hidden Runaway would be a hidden object title that featured 12 minigames. It was one of Pendulo's two projects, alongside the crowdfunded Day One, planned to follow the studio's 2012 game Yesterday. According to writer Josu√© Monchan, both projects came at a difficult time for Pendulo, as the commercial failure of The Next Big Thing and ultimately Yesterday alienated publishers and made funding hard to obtain. Hidden Runaway marked a departure for Pendulo. Lead programmer Felipe G√≥mez Pinilla called it the team's first title outside the adventure genre, for which Pendulo had been known since its 1994 debut. Latiegui summarized it as \\"Runaway revisited in a casual way\\", and studio head Ram√≥n Hern√°ez noted that it was Pendulo's first foray into the casual game market. In 2012, he called hidden object games \\"very attractive for us\\" going forward, as they were similar to Pendulo's existing work but at a smaller scale and with different expectations from buyers. Hern√°ez said that Hidden Runaway would be the first of several casual titles intended as lighthearted counterparts to the studio's darker Yesterday and Day One. Latiegui and Monchan characterized Hidden Runaways development as an enjoyable new experience. Conversely, Pendulo composer Juan Miguel Mar√≠n later dubbed it \\"the only time that Pendulo Studios responded to the demands of the market\\", and unsatisfying as a result. Hidden Runaway was developed for Microsoft Windows, OS X and iOS devices, and was initially scheduled for a May 2012 release. The game remained in production by August, at which point it was undergoing the final stages of development, Latiegui said. Bulkypix launched Hidden Runaway for iOS via the App Store on October 18, 2012. In Germany, its computer version debuted in retail stores during August 2013, published for Windows by Rondomedia. Reception Metacritic calculated Hidden Runaways reviews as \\"mixed or average\\". Writing for Pocket Gamer, Harry Slater found the game \\"interesting, if ultimately disappointing\\". He praised its story and visual presentation, but felt that its object-hunting sections were poorly balanced and paced. Jeuxvideo.coms reviewer echoed Slater's praise for the visuals but broke with him on the gameplay: the writer argued that Hidden Runaway is a solid execution of the hidden object formula, which recaptures the atmosphere of earlier Runaway titles. However, he sharply criticized Hidden Runaways sudden ending, with its \\"completely inappropriate\\" Whac-a-Mole section and \\"attempt to beg\\" for money to make Hidden Runaway 2. As a result, he concluded that the game has a \\"very bitter\\" aftertaste for players. In Spain, Hidden Runaway won positive scores from David Alonso Hern√°ndez of HobbyConsolas and Fernando Fontanet-Bel of Vandal, while Gina Tost of IGN Espa√±a called it evidence that Spain's game industry was \\"in very good shape\\". Hern√°ndez and Fontanet-Bel both enjoyed the gameplay, and, like Jeuxvideo.coms writer, felt that Hidden Runaway effectively translated Pendulo Studios' style to a touch-controlled casual format. However, although Fontanet-Bel was unbothered by the game's limited animation, Hern√°ndez considered it a downside that hurt the title's overall presentation. He also found the audio lacking. Fontanet-Bel concluded his review by calling Hidden Runaway an encouraging sign for Pendulo's future on iOS, but Hern√°ndez went further, arguing that it \\"once again highlights the enormous potential of smartphones and tablets when it comes to embracing graphic adventures\\". In 2014, Pendulo's Josu√© Monchan called Hidden Runaway \\"a complete disaster\\" financially. According to Juan Miguel Mar√≠n, it was the company's worst-selling game by October 2016. Combined with the poor performances of The Next Big Thing and Yesterday, and the failed crowdfunding campaign of Day One, Hidden Runaway contributed to Pendulo's financial decline. After its release, the company entered a multi-year period in which it launched no original games, and instead ported its back catalog to iOS in an attempt to survive. Pendulo ultimately returned with the game Yesterday Origins in 2016.

He married Isabel de Faria, who was born in Portugal, with whom he had a son, also named Peter. His son, also an engraver, Hispanicized his name and went by \\"Pedro Perete\\".  Background  Overview of San Lorenzo Del Escorial, 1589 Born in Antwerp around 1555, he was a pupil of engravers Maarten de Vos and Gerard de Jode. Prior to 1578 he studied engraving in Rome with Cornelis Cort. After that, he returned to Antwerp, eventually moving to Bavaria, where he was appointed engraver to William IV, Duke of Bavaria and the Elector of Cologne. During this time, he may also have worked in Paris for publisher Nicolas Le Bon. In 1584 Juan de Herrera commissioned Perret to print images of the plants and topographical views of the Monastery of San Lorenzo Del Escorial. Herrera was to provide the copper plates already drawn by his hand, and Perret was to engrave them for a fee of 600 ducats. Perret moved to Madrid and was bound to take on no other work until the plates were engraved. However, the work was not completed until 1589. That year, they were collected in a small book titled Sumaria y breve declaraci√≥n de los dise√±os y estampas de la f√°brica de San Lorenzo del Escorial and sold by Herrera. Despite the prohibition on taking on other work, Perret published the first of his portraits, that of the Empress Maria of Austria, in 1585. San Lorenzo Del Escorial In 1590 he returned to Antwerp where he became a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in 1594. Between 1591 and 1595, he published some allegorical engravings based on drawings provided by Otto van Veen. Among them were works dedicated to Herrera and Philip II. Other works from this time are three small plates of prophets Daniel, Ezekiel, and Haggai, following designs by Nicolas van Houy for the work Icones prophetarum maiorum et minorum (1594) published in Antwerp by Philip Galle. Copies of these three plates are preserved in the L√°zaro Galdiano Museum in Madrid. In 1595 he was appointed as a court engraver by Philip II, with a salary of 100 ducats per year. With the royal appointment, he established himself in Madrid, focusing on book publishing. He focused not only on book covers and portraits, but also typographic marks and small ornaments. Perret published at least thirty-four books while in Madrid, with more in Lisbon, where he may have moved during the Iberian Union. Some of his best-known works of this time are portraits, including the Retrato de San Ignacio de Loyola () included in the Obras of Father Ribadeneira. Also notable are the portraits of the Cistercian theologian , that of Mateo Alem√°n, published with the first part of Guzm√°n de Alfarache, and that of , collected in his Sphera del Universo, which also included a strongly mannerist-looking allegory of Astronom√≠a, copied from . Between 1609 and his death, he published the covers of most of the books in Madrid. Among the books published are La conquista de las Molucas (), by Bartolom√© Leonardo de Argensola in 1609, De la veneraci√≥n que se debe a los cuerpos de los santos y a sus reliquias (), by Sancho D√°vila Toledo, Bishop of Ja√©n in 1611; Compendio de las fiestas que se hicieron en la beatificaci√≥n de la madre Teresa de Jes√∫s (), by Diego de San Jos√© in 1615; Council and counselor of princes, by in 1617; Filipe Segundo Rey de Espa√±a, by Luis Cabrera de C√≥rdoba in 1619, with an image of Phillip II as \\"defender of faith,\\" He provided two interior illustrations on designs by the architect Juan G√≥mez de Mora. The cover of the Er√≥ticas or Amatorias, by Esteban Manuel de Villegas, printed in N√°jera in 1618 by Juan de Mongast√≥n, also seems to be by him.

California is at the lower right; the mythical sea is above it. The Sea of the West, or Mer de l'Ouest, was a geographic misconception of an inland sea in the Pacific Northwest that appeared on many maps of the 18th century. The depiction was particularly common on French maps. The sea was supposed to be connected to the Pacific Ocean by at least one strait. Many different conjectures about the sea's shape, size, and position appeared on maps of the period. Belief in the sea's existence derived from writings describing two voyages of discovery, one by an Admiral Bartholomew de Fonte, and one by Juan de Fuca. De Fuca's voyage might have happened, but his account is now known to have contained many distortions and confabulations. Admiral de Fonte, on the other hand, is not known to be a historical figure, and the account of his voyage is fiction. Several maps in the early 1700s depicted the sea, but interest and belief in its existence waned until the mid 1700s, when, fairly suddenly, Mer de l'Ouest reappeared on maps and quickly became common for several decades. European knowledge of the region gradually improved such that belief in the inland sea became untenable before 1800.  Origins  Juan de Fuca was born Ioannis Phok√°s () in the Ionian Islands of Greece in 1536. Through an account by Michael Lok, de Fuca claimed to have been in the service of the Spanish Crown for decades, during which he had traveled in the Far East. By 1587, he was purportedly stranded in New Spain when his galleon was captured by Thomas Cavendish. Under sponsorship of the Viceroy of New Spain, de Fuca claimed to have piloted a voyage up the western coast of North America in 1592, reaching a strait into an inland sea at latitude 47¬∞. The feature now known as the Strait of Juan de Fuca is at 48¬∞N, so de Fuca's claim to have been there is plausible. However, de Fuca's description of the region, as conveyed by Lok in 1625, is not recognizable and is considered to be largely an invention, either by Lok or by de Fuca himself. Michael Lok's involvement is significant because Lok was the principal patron of the Frobisher Expedition in search of a Northwest Passage. The riches of the Pacific were very distant from Europe, such that much treasure and lives had been expended and lost in lengthy and dangerous passage between the two regions. For hundreds of years, finding a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific by some means more direct and less treacherous than the Straits of Magellan was high priority for European powers. The prospect of royal patronage, riches, and fame inspired dreamers, schemers, and explorers to search for such a route. This encouraged an environment of intrigue and rumor. Imaginary voyages, whether into a Northest Passage or to treasure islands, found easy audience. Whether based on the de Fuca account or otherwise, a few manuscript maps in the 1600s showed speculative geography that included branches of the Pacific Ocean protruding deeply into the North American continent. One such map from the late 1630s held by the Yale Center for British Art shows such a branch reaching as close as a few hundred miles from the east coast. Apparently inspired by these inventions, Guillaume Delisle drew several maps by hand between 1695 and about 1700 that portray such eastern intrusions of the Pacific Ocean. Joseph Nicholas Delisle, Guillaume's half-brother, printed copies of one of these maps. Guillaume continued drafting and revising his conception of this western sea over decades, but he never published any maps depicting the Sea of the West despite his prolific output of printed maps. A few maps based on Delisle's were produced over the next several decades. As cartographer to the king and teacher of his children, Guillaume Delisle's ideas had influence. On his earliest manuscript, Delisle wrote concerning the sea, ‚Ä¶pas encore d√©couverte mais autoris√©e' par le rapport de plusieurs savages qui assurent avoir ete' (not yet discovered but authorized by the report of several savages who claim to have been there). In 1716, the governor of New France had produced a memoir sketching out a water route from Lake Winnipeg to the Sea of the West. The French Ministry of Marine pressured for exploration, but would not fund expeditions. The French Canadians, on the other hand, were interested in the fur trade. In 1731, Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V√©rendrye was hired with the dual commissions of exploration and developing fur trade routes. Over the course of the next twelve years, La V√©rendrye's expeditions pushed as far west as Saskatchewan and Wyoming in their search for furs, the \\"River of the West\\", and the Sea of the West. By 1743, the French Ministry of Marine had tired of La V√©rendrye, suspecting him of trading furs when he should have been exploring, and pressured him into resigning. In 1708, a new account of a fantastic voyage had emerged that would eventually become highly influential. In April of that year, a short-lived English periodical named Monthly Miscellany, or Memoirs for the Curious published an alleged letter by one Admiral Bartholomew de Fonte. The letter was supposedly translated from Spanish. It gave a detailed narrative of a voyage undertaken in 1640 to the northwestern coast of North America, dealings with the natives, passage into a great inland sea, long, elaborate waterways into the interior of the continent, and probable connection to the eastern coasts of North America. Presumably due to the magazine's obscurity, the account did not inspire any maps for decades. That would change.  Development  The Sea of the West theme was ignored by most mapmakers until 1750. In that year, Joseph Nicholas Delisle commissioned Philippe Buache to draft a map with a radical new portrayal of Mer de l'Ouest (literally, \\"Western Sea\\" but usually found on English maps as \\"Sea of the West\\"), crediting de Fonte with explorations there. Buache had married Guillaume Delisle's daughter, making Nicholas his uncle and inheriting Guillaume's printing plates and stock of maps by marriage. Nicholas presented this manuscript to the Royal Academy of Sciences, where it incited controversy. Buache published this map in 1752, and Nicolas further stoked the controversy with his 1753 publication, Nouvelles Cartes des D√©couvertes de l'Amiral de Fonte: et autres Navigateurs. In that book, he presents diverse cartographic interpretations of the accounts of \\"Admiral de Fonte and other Spanish, Portuguese, English, Dutch, French, and Russian mariners who have sailed the North Seas, including their commentaries\\". As \\"Professor of Mathematics at the Royal College, member of the Royal Academies of Sciences in Paris, London, Berlin, Stockholm, Uppsala, and the [Royal] Institute of Bologna; also named as the first Professor of Astronomy at the Imperial Academy of Saint Petersburg\\", Delisle had standing. The mapping world split between subscribers to and skeptics of the Mer de l'Ouest conception. Much debate ensued over a long period of time, spilling over into the communications of luminaries of the time. For example, in 1762, Benjamin Franklin penned a long analysis of the de Fonte letter, concluding, \\"If I have conjectured truly, this very Difference is a farther Proof that the Journal is really a Translation from the Spanish, and not, as some have supposed, an English Fiction.\\" One day twenty-one years later, John Adams wrote in his diary that Franklin had mentioned the de Fonte voyage that day, still finding new reasons that it must be true. The concept gained another boost in 1768 when mapmaker Thomas Jefferys wrote a treatise called The Great Probability of a North West Passage analyzing the de Fonte letter. McGuirk catalogued 94 distinct maps as portraying the Sea of the West in the 68 years before this time, as opposed to 160 in the next 30 years. Increasingly, English mapmakers opted to show the sea. The profusion of maps and the intense speculation surrounding the matter prompted the Spanish to launch an investigation into the voyage of de Fonte, who was supposed to have conducted a major expedition sponsored by the Spanish Crown. The investigation turned up no such character or expedition mentioned in Spanish archives. McGuirk described eight distinct cartographic interpretations of the sea's shape and extent. With a few aberrations, each of the 239 Mer de l'Ouest maps he catalogued is based on one of those archetypes. It is not always clear how an archetype developed, but many of them were sincere efforts at interpreting the de Fonte letter. Some of the more famous mapmakers who produced maps depicting the sea include: * Jean Baptiste Nolin * Emanuel Bowen * Jacques-Nicolas Bellin * Pierre Mortier * Philippe Buache * Leonhard Euler * Thomas Kitchin * Didier Robert de Vaugondy * Thomas Jefferys * Louis Brion de la Tour * Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville * Robert Sayer * Denis Diderot * Antonio Zatta * Thomas Bowen * Edme Mentelle * Rigobert Bonne * Jedediah Morse * William Faden * Charles Fran√ßois Delamarche  Disappearance  By the late 1700s, European presence in the northeast Pacific, and the flow of information from it, cast serious doubt on the Sea of the West conjecture. Coming from his explorations of Hawaii in 1778, James Cook sailed to what is now the Oregon coast, along the entire northwest coastline, through the Bering Strait, and into the Chukchi Sea in northern Alaska. His explorations and surveys were not systematic, but nevertheless, his discoveries, and lack of discoveries, quickly made their way onto many maps that completely rearranged the old ideas about the region. His explorations gave form to the coastlines of what are now southern Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington State. Combined with information trickling out of Russia about the explorations of Vitus Bering decades earlier, and subsequent Russian presence in the area, the prospects of finding either a Northwest Passage or a great sea in the Pacific Northwest dwindled. Information did not always travel rapidly or thoroughly. Publishers did not always know whether to accept the latest claims about discoveries, nor did they wish to spend the money to revise their maps. While fewer, maps depicting the Sea of the West continued to be published even after Cook's reports became widespread. The last original depiction that was intended to convey the reality of the sea appeared in 1790 in John Meares's Voyage Made in the Year 1788 and 1789, From China to the North West Coast of America. This representation incorporated what appears to be Vancouver Island as a sort of shield behind which was to be found an indistinct sea. Captain George Vancouver's account of his voyage of 1791‚Äì1792, along with his detailed, expert mapping, left no room for doubt: The Sea of the West was a myth. Nevertheless, a few maps still depicting the sea appeared up until about 1810.

Topics Journey into Geometries is written as a conversation between three characters: Alice, from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (but older and familiar with Euclidean geometry), Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice's adventures, and a modern mathematician named \\"Dr. Whatif\\". Its topics include hyperbolic geometry, inversive geometry, and projective geometry, following an arrangement of these topics credited to Australian mathematician Carl Moppert, and possibly based on an earlier German-language textbook on similar topics by F. Gonseth and P. Marti. As in Alice's original adventures, the first part of the book is arranged as a travelogue. This part of the book has six chapters, each ending with a set of exercises. Following these chapters, more conventionally written material covers geometric axiom systems and provides solutions to the exercises. Audience and reception Reviewer William E. Fenton is unsure of the audience of the book, writing that it is not suitable as a textbook and would scare most undergraduates, but is too unserious for graduate students. David A. Thomas identifies the audience as \\"people who like to play with mathematical ideas\\". Fenton criticizes the book's style as a little too glib and lead-footed, and its illustrations as amateurish. H. W. Guggenheimer faults the treatment of projective geometry as \\"rather sketchy\\". Nevertheless Fenton writes that he found the book engrossing and well- organized, particularly praising its exercises. Both Fenton and Guggenheimer recommend the book to talented students of mathematics, and both Fenton and David A. Thomas suggest it as auxiliary reading for geometry courses.

He is known for his work on the origins and development of the Gondi language, and particularly for his creation of a script for it. Kangali authored Gondi dictionaries in English, Hindi and Marathi. He also aided efforts for the standardization and preservation of Gondi grammar while authoring several books on Gond society, culture and religion. Motiravan Kangali claimed that the scripts of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro could be read in Gondi language. He also proposed that the Gond people must have been in the Indus Valley.  Early life  Motiravan Kangali was born on 2 February 1949 in a village called Dulara of Ramtek Tehsil in Nagpur district of Maharashtra. His place of birth is located in the forests of Bhander near Devlapar, about 75 km from Nagpur on Nagpur Seoni State Road and he was born in the family of Tirkaji Kangali (grandfather) of a Gond community. His mother's name was Dai Raithaar Kangali and father's name was Dau Chathiram Kangali. Named Motiram at birth, he was the eldest of five siblings, with two brothers and two sisters. As an adult, he changed his first name from Motiram to Motiravan to highlight the Gond tradition which reveres Ravana. Kangali's early education took place at Karwahi where he studied up to fourth grade. He did his secondary education (5th to 8th) in the Anglo East Secondary School, Bothia Palora, about 18 km from Dulara. He joined HUDS High School in Nagpur and passed the class X examinations in 1968. In 1972, he graduated from Dharampeth College, Nagpur. He subsequently obtained a Masters (M.A) in Economics, Sociology and Linguistics from the Post Graduate Teaching Department Nagpur. He received his Ph.D in 2000 from Aligarh Muslim University. The subject of his dissertation was \\"The Philosophical Base of Tribal Cultural Values Particularly in Respect of Gond Tribes of Central India\\". In 1976, at the age of 27, Kangali was appointed a Notes and Currency Examiner at the Reserve Bank of India's Nagpur Mint. He married Raitad (Kumari) Chandralekha Roop Singh Pusam. You have three daughters named series Kangali, Verunjali Kangali, Vinanti Kangali. The series is an IRS officer and Vinanti is an eye specialist doctor. Both of them have been married. Manjali's daughter Verunjali has also done her M.Phil in Marathi literature and is currently living in Nagpur and working in mother's work. As a researcher, he worked to revive the Gondi language while studying linguistics and helped make books available to the general public to learn and teach Gondi language.  Revival of the Gond tribal fair Kangali, along with friends K B Maraskole and Sheetal Markam, visited Kachhargarh in Bhandara district, Maharashtra, having read about the traditional Gond fair or Jatra held there on the occasion of Maagh Purnima. In Gond tradition, the day marks the rescue of the mother goddess, Mata Kali Kankali's children from a cave by the Gond ancestor, Pari Kupar Lingo and his sister Jango Raitad. They discovered that the fair had shrunk in attendance from the past, down to around 500 visitors. They began the work of reviving the significance of the fair among the Gonds until the fair scaled back up to attendance in 1986 by as many as 3-4 lakh tribals from Central India, Maharashtra, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Recognized for his efforts, Kangali was appointed head of the apex religious body of the Gonds, the Gondi Punem. Keshav Banaji Maraskole, who hails from Maharu Tola, had first told Kangali about the location of the supposed cave from which the rescue occurred. Traditionally, local Gond residents would worship at that cave in a ceremony called Gongo. Kangali researched the antecedents of the worship and the cave itself, and discovered references to it in the writings of Robert Vane Russell and C U Wills. Kangali, Maraskole and Sunher Singh Taram (editor of the Bhopal periodical Gondwana Darshan) attended the fair in 1980. In 1984, two more notable Gond leaders, Bharat Lal Koram and Sheetal Markam (by then, the head of the Gondwana Mukti Sena organisation) joined them and the five made the first trek from the fair to the location of the cave. Over the next few years, Kacchargarh emerged as the primary religious centre of Koitur Gonds and in 1986, Hira Singh Markam also joined the pilgrimage. Koiturs from many states began joining the jatra. Over 40 years, visitors to the jatra now number in the millions..  Writing career  Motiravan Kangali freed the religious places of Gond Koitur from the occupation of Hindus. The Hindus established their deities in exchange for the Gond ancestors. Dr. Kangali also worked on this subject and by writing many books in the common public, he brought the truth of these Goddess places to everyone. Some of them wrote small books about important goddess places such as Bamleshwari Dai of Dongargarh, Danteshwari Dai of Bastar, Tilaka Dai of Korodigarh and Kankali Dai of Chandagarh. There is a great need to further their work in the field of Gondi philosophy culture. If this work is not done quickly, the cultural awakening in Gondwana will soon go into a dormancy. In order to establish and promote Gondi philosophy and religion (Koya Punem), he envisaged the Bhumka (Purohit) federation and began its propaganda, which was later handed over to Tirumal Ravan Shah Invati and got himself busy writing. Today the Bhumka Mahasangh is active in establishing and promoting Koya Punem by training its roles in other states including Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Kangali's book Gondi Punamdarshan was a chronicle of the cultural history of Gondwana (the land of the Gonds). His wife Chandralekha Kangali, a sociologist and scholar in her own right, collaborated with him on this and other works of his. He did many things in the field of Gondi language and also gave his full support and cooperation in getting Gondi recognized at the national level. But look at the misfortune that such an ancient language, which is in crores of speakers, which has its own beautiful grammar and script, is being ignored by the Government of India and even after so many struggles and movements, Gondi language is not found in the eighth schedule of India Is getting. Kangali's Pari Kupar Lingo Gondi Darshan was an outcome of his research on Gond Punem, a philosophical framework created by Pari Kupar Lingo. The book also provides a narrative of the conflict between indigenous residents and the Aryans. Kangali had also researched possible links between Dravidian languages and the as-yet undeciphered Indus script. When Kangali inspected 22 painted characters discovered in the mid-1990s in Hampi, he interpreted five of them as similar to Gondi characters. Motiravan Kangali was very concerned about the Gondi language. He used to say that no language can be landed inside any culture and if a culture is to be destroyed then destroy its language. This is what is happening with the Gondi language in this country. If the Gondi language does not exist then the imagination of Gond, Gondwana will become meaningless and the ancient glorious culture and the people who celebrate it will also become extinct one day. This is a concern that governments must understand and make efforts to save and groom Gondi language culture. Death Kangali died on 30 October 2015.

Trigger The massacre was a vandetta killing undertaken by members of Kurmi caste against the Bhumihars.Ten days before the massacre, the Bhumihars of Afsar village in central Bihar were involved in killing of 8 people from the backward castes.Out of these 8 people 3 belonged to Kurmi caste who retaliated by killing 12 members of the Bhumihar community. Over 50 armed men who were dressed in paramilitary uniform entered Afsar village after midnight and opened fire on 15 people who were sleeping on a terrace. The killers then captured those who were alive even after facing the gunshots, their throats were slit with long swords.As a result of which Eleven people died on the spot. Of the remaining four, one died while he was on the way to hospital by the inmates. The dead included a four-year-old and a 10-year-old. Two schoolboys who tried to escape when the firing started, were later admitted to the hospital at Patna.According to a report of The Telegraph, the 67-year-old Babulal Sharma who was a survivor of the incident said: The roots of the caste tension which resulted in the massacre was in election of Aruna Devi, wife of gangster Akhilesh Singh as Member of Legislative Assembly from the region.Akhilesh Singh was responsible for kiling of people of Dalit community and some Yadavs in \\"Rajobigha village.\\"This incident brought Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav into the village who assured the victim backward castes of proper compensation and also launched a campaign against the Akhilesh Singh as well as Ashok Mahto gang, who was supposed to have perpetrated the massacre of upper castes at Afsar village.The victims were close relatives of the Akhilesh Singh. Investigation Earlier it was thought by a large section of media and the families of victims that the massacre was a retaliation by Yadavs as a reaction to \\"Rajobigha massacre\\", in which 5 Yadavs were killed by the Bhumihars.But, investigation unfolded the cause of killings to be retaliation by Kurmis who avenged the death of 3 Kurmis at the hands of Bhumihars.It was reported that the Deputy superintendent of police P.K Mandal aided Mahto gang to kill the Bhumihars at Afsar. Since the formation of Samata Party Yadav were against the Kurmi and the Koeri. But this carnage was seen as a possible alliance between the two to take on the Bhumihars. The incident which took place at Afsar village made Ranvir Sena a militant organisation of Bhumihars to undertake the \\"Mianpur carnage\\", in which 35 people most of them belonging to Yadav community and some of the Dalits were killed. The Mianpur massacre was a singnal by the outlawed organisation to send message to Lalu-Rabri government.The Sena also shouted slogans like \\"Lalu-Rabri murdabad (Down with the Lalu-Rabri government)\\" after the \\"Mianpur killing\\" to show their discontent against the Rashtriya Janata Dal government as according to them the government was itself behind promoting enmity between the various castes.The Sena's action was a consequence of growing anxiety among Bhumihars who were victims of both Afsar and \\"Senari massacre\\".Senari was a village just 10 km away from the \\"Mianpur\\" in which 34 people of Bhumihar community were killed a year before the Afsar incident by Maoist Communist Centre. Investigation also find it contrasting that though the \\"Afsar killing\\" was engineered by the Kurmis, Bhumihars killed mostly Yadavs in Mianpur.According to media reports, few days after Afsar massacre the chief of Ranvir Sena, Brahmeshwar Singh visited the house of Akhilesh Singh, the Bhumihar gangster whose family members and relatives were gunned down by the Kurmi gangster Ashok Mahto.The chief told Singh not to antagonise Kurmis as their real enemies were Yadavs.The fact that core base of Samata Party were Kurmi and Bhumihars and in case of differences between them Yadavs can get an upper hand prevented Sena to retaliate against the Kurmis. Aftermath According to an Indian Express report Rashtriya Janata Dal government was selective in visiting the place of massacre.The leaders frequently visited the places were Dalits were killed but gave less importance to the places were \\"upper caste\\" were the victim.During \\"Afsar massacre\\", Lalu Prasad condemned the incident but avoided visiting the site as during his earlier visits at \\"Senari\\" and other places were \\"upper castes\\" were killed, he was hooted by the kinsmen of the victims. Meanwhile, the \\"Mianpur\\" was the last big massacre perpetrated by Ranvir Sena after which it went into dormancy. The Massacre at Afsar (Nawada) was also followed by large scale rioting by Bhumihar youths, who thrashed the glasses of vehicles passing through the nearby Highway and pelted stones at them.

He was strangled to death by his assailants and his body was found by his wife, who reported the murder to the police. After that, three of the assailants and the victim's wife (who was in fact aware of the murder plot all along) were arrested and consequently, the three killers who were arrested were tried for death and the wife received imprisonment for their respective crimes. However, till today, the final culprit of the crime remains at large. The crime=A shocking discovery At around 2.15 in the morning of 25 October 1984, after some shopping and a session of mahjong with her friends, 50-year-old married housewife Lee Chee Poh (Traditional Chinese: ÊùéÊûùÂØ∂; Simplified Chinese: ÊùéÊûùÂÆù; Pinyin: l«ê zhƒ´b«éo), also known as Rose Lee, returned home. As she entered through the front door of her Laguna Park flat, she would make a shocking discovery. As she entered the study room of her banker husband Tan Tik Siah (Traditional Chinese: Èô≥ÈêµÂüé; Simplified Chinese: ÈôàÈìÅÂüé; Pinyin: ch√©n t«êech√©ng), also known as Frankie Tan, Lee was shocked to see her 39-year-old husband lying there dead with a nylon rope around his neck, and bruises on his face and body. Full of grief and distraught at the sight of her husband's dead body, Lee managed to wake up her neighbour and seek help. The police were contacted and they arrived at the scene. They investigated and found no signs of a forced entry or no signs of anything missing from the flat. An autopsy by forensic pathologist Dr Clarence Tan (unrelated to the victim Tan Tik Siah) later showed that the cause of Tan's death was asyphyxia by strangulation; he died sometime between 8pm to 10pm the night before on 24 October 1984. The rope was uniformly tied around Tan's neck six times. From the manner of Tan's injuries, Dr Clarence Tan believed that there were at least two people involved in the murder of Tan, who was then a vice-president and regional treasurer of American Express International Banking Corporation (or simply known as Amex). A remorseful wife's confession: Three arrests The case was classified as murder. The case was assigned to Inspector Teo Cheow Beng of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), who headed the police investigations. The murdered victim's wife, Lee Chee Poh, was brought into the CID for questioning that very night. Lee, who was hysterical and full of remorse, confessed to her police interrogators that in fact, she was a part of a premeditated plot to murder her husband, and implicated her 41-year-old brother-in-law Vasavan Sathiadew in the plot. Vasavan, who was the adoptive elder brother of Tan Tik Siah (with whom he was close to), was soon arrested at the Ang Mo Kio flat of Mdm Sim, the birth mother of Tan, and also Vasavan's adoptive mother. Vasavan, who grew up in a Chinese family since 1959 and thus adopted both a Chinese name, Tan Kim Siah (Traditional Chinese: Èô≥ÈáëÂüé; Simplified Chinese: ÈôàÈáëÂüé; Pinyin: ch√©n jƒ´nch√©ng), and an English name, Augustine, told police that he had hired and paid three Thai men to go with him to assault and murder his foster brother due to Tan having an affair with Amnoi, Vasavan's Thai wife, with whom Vasavan had a son (born in 1977) and daughter (born in 1969). With Vasavan's statements, the police officers went to a construction site where Vasavan worked as a foreman, and arrested a Thai construction worker, 42-year-old Phan Khenapim, who came from Northern Thailand and worked in Singapore since 1981. Phan was said to be one of the Thai accomplices who murdered Tan. Another Thai worker from another construction site, 21-year-old Wan Phatong, was also arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder. A third Thai accomplice, Buakkan Vajjarin, more commonly referred to as Ah Poo, was never caught. All four arrested were charged with murder. Trial of Lee Chee Poh=Charge reduced: Lee Chee Poh's story On 17 October 1988, Lee Chee Poh stood trial alone for her abetment of her husband's murder, represented by lawyer Loh Lin Kok (who was the former lawyer of the 1983 Andrew Road triple murderer Sek Kim Wah). By then, the prosecution agreed to, on account of Lee's full cooperation with the police and remorse over her husband's death, reduce Lee's charge of abetment of murder to one of abetment of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Lee pleaded guilty and was convicted of the reduced charge. At the trial, it was then a story of how a budding romance ended in tragedy was told in the High Court. Lee Chee Poh, who came from Malacca, Malaysia to Singapore for a better life, first met Tan Tik Siah sometime in the early or mid-1960s at a cabaret where she had been working for the past 10 years. Despite their 11-year age difference, Lee became romantically involved with Tan, and in 1966, she forked out her earnings to allow Tan to go to night school, where he graduated and completed his secondary school education. The couple were married in 1969, and they resided in Tan's mother's kampong house in Potong Pasir. The next year, the couple moved into a two-room HDB flat in Jalan Toa Payoh; by then, Tan was employed in the Amex bank. At some point in the early 1970s, Tan was embroiled in stock market difficulties, and in order to help her husband, Lee even raised $20,000 out of her jewellery and savings. The couple later moved to their current home in a flat in Laguna Park in 1975. They had no children. Discovery of husband's infidelity and abuse In early 1981, it was at that point when Lee Chee Poh's life would change forever. She picked up a call from a distressed Vasavan Sathiadew, who informed her of a shocking event that he discovered from his wife Amnoi. Lee was full of disbelief when she heard Vasavan telling her that Amnoi had confessed to him earlier on that she, in fact, had been sleeping with Lee's husband Tan Tik Siah for 11 years since their 1969 marriage. After cutting the call, Lee questioned her husband if it was true; Tan said yes, but defensively said that Amnoi seduced him first. It was also came to light that Tan was also outside philandering for other women during their years of marriage, and in addition to his adoptive brother Vasavan's wife, he had also have illicit affairs with the wives of his two other unnamed brothers, and his secretary. As an aftermath of this incident, it was then Tan began to grow more unfaithful to his wife, and more abusive towards her. Two years before his violent death, Tan began to bring back home a 25-year-old divorcee named Thereisa Lee (unrelated to Lee Chee Poh), and let her live with them. After bringing the mistress back home, every night, Tan told Lee (his wife) to sleep in another bedroom while he shared both their bedroom with Thereisa Lee; by then he had attained a high-ranking position in the bank. He also later brought both Lee and his mistress overseas to Japan and the USA to allow Lee to get to know the mistress better and accept her as part of the family. During that period, he fathered a son with Thereisa Lee, whom he began to introduce to people as his wife. Tan also wanted Thereisa Lee and the unnamed son to live with him so that he can take care of them as well. Lee had long resigned herself to her husband's philandering even before the appearance of Thereisa Lee, and despite the frequent abuses which Tan brought upon her, Lee still loved him and hoped that he could stop ill-treating her. Finally, one day in 1984, Tan told Lee, his wife of 15 years, that he wanted a divorce. Despite consenting to it, Lee asked the ownership of their Laguna Park flat be given to her should the divorce be granted and finalized. Tan rejected. At the same time, Vasavan, who thirsted for revenge on Tan, who he fell out with, for the earlier adulterous affair between him and Amnoi, had been persuading Lee to have her husband dead since it was for certain that Tan will never be nice to her and go back to her. Although she schemed with Vasavan to use black magic to kill Tan for his repeated infidelity and abuse, Lee maintained her love for her husband and never wanted him to die; in her heart, she still held on to the hope of her husband going back to her. Sadly, this was not to be. Two days before the fateful night on 24 October 1984, when Lee Chee Poh went to the airport to fetch her husband, Tan Tik Siah once again abused and ill-treated her, this time very badly, even treating her as a chauffeur instead of as his wife. This was the final straw. Seeing how incorrigible and unrepentant her husband had become, Lee's endurance has finally snapped and her fragile hope was gone. Lamentably, she consented to Vasavan's plot to murder her husband and handed him the spare keys to their flat, and gave him $4,500 as payment to those whom Vasavan would hire to murder Tan. Vasavan even assured her that her husband's death would look natural with black magic. Still, despite so, Lee had never wanted her husband to die all along and she would have called off the murder had Tan treated her nicely; she also wanted to dissuade Vasavan from killing Tan on the day of the murder itself but could not reach him by phone. Lee Chee Poh's sentence On 17 October 1989, the same date of her conviction by the High Court, High Court Judge Punch Coomaraswamy sentenced 54-year-old Lee Chee Poh to 7 years' imprisonment. Additionally, the 7-year-imprisonment sentence was backdated to 26 October 1984, the date of Lee's remand; with one-third remission for good behaviour, Lee would effectively only need to serve 4 years and 8 months. Since she served with good behaviour, and the sentence being backdated to 4 years earlier, Lee would be released 8 months later in June 1989. During sentencing, Justice Coomaraswamy took into consideration the tragic life which Lee had gone through with her abusive marriage. He expressed his sympathy to Lee for her plight. In his own words while delivering the judgement, Justice Coomaraswamy said to Lee, \\"That he (Tan Tik Siah) treated you cruelly in bringing a mistress (Thereisa Lee) home from time to time and making you sleep in another bedroom proves him to be an extremely callous person. I think you had put up with a lot.\\" Lee reportedly broke down as she received the sentence. However, the murder charges against Lee's brother-in-law Vasavan Sathiadew, and the two of Vasavan's three Thai accomplices Phan Khenapim and Wan Phatong remained. As the crime of murder under Singapore law carries the mandatory death penalty, should they be found guilty, all three men would be sentenced to death. Lee Chee Poh later became the prosecution's key witness against the three men, who all stood trial a month after her release. Trial of the three men=The prosecution's case The trial of Vasavan Sathiadew and his two Thai accomplices Phan Khenapim and Wan Phatong began on 3 July 1989. All three men stood trial before two High Court judges - Judicial Commissioner Joseph Grimberg and Justice T. S. Sinnathuray (he was one of the two judges who sentenced the three child killers of the 1981 Toa Payoh Ritual Murders to death 6 years earlier) - in the High Court of Singapore. Prominent lawyer Leo Fernando was assigned to defend Vasavan, and Fernando was also assisted by another lawyer Remesha Pillai throughout the trial. Two other lawyers, Lim Choon Mong (the father of Singaporean opposition politician Slyvia Lim of the Workers' Party) and V. C. S. Vardan, were also assigned to defend Phan and Wan respectively. Till then, the police were still tracing the whereabouts of the missing Ah Poo, the third and last Thai accomplice. = Lee Chee Poh's testimony and cross-examination = The prosecution's case were largely based on the police statements given by the three men, and also the testimony of Lee Chee Poh, who took the stand as the prosecution's key witness. On the stand, while giving her testimony, she was extensively cross- examined by the three men's lawyers. When cross-examined by Fernando, Lee disagreed with Fernando's claim that there was never any plot to murder her husband Tan Tik Siah, but just to beat him up. She did, however, agreed that till then, there was no agreement to kill her husband in any other way other than black magic, and she also told the court that Vasavan told her that the black magic would be powerful and make the death look natural. When she was cross-examined by Mr Lim (Phan's lawyer) and Mr Vardan (Wan's lawyer) respectively, Lee agreed that all along, she never wanted her husband to die. She disagreed with Mr Lim's suggestion that she was compelled into testifying against the three men in the murder trial after the prosecution reduced her charge while conceding with Mr Vardan's suggestion that Tan meant a lot to her and she was being totally dependent on him, which was why she could not likely want to kill her \\"golden goose\\". Not only that, during her cross-examination by Mr Lim, Lee said that even before the discovery of her husband's illicit affair with Thereisa Lee, she was already aware of his womanising and his affairs with all his three sister-in-laws (including Vasavan's wife Amnoi) and secretary. When asked if she ever tried to put a stop to it or object to these affairs, she answered that she could not do anything about it, as her husband was \\"such a person\\". = Validity of the statements = Inspector Lim Cheow Beng also took the stand. He read out the statements from Vasavan, in which Vasavan had admitted to the conspiracy with Lee to murder Tan, hiring and pay the three Thais to help him commit the murder, and buying the 10m long nylon rope to kill Tan while denying that he was involved in the grievous assault and murder of Tan despite being at the scene (however, Wan's statement said that Vasavan was involved in the attack). However, through his lawyer, Vasavan challenged the validity of the statements, claiming that they were not given voluntarily. Similarly, Phan and Wan also claimed that their statements were not given voluntarily. Phan said that he was illiterate and could not understand the charge he was facing or what he was charged with until the beginning of the trial; he claimed that he completely could not understand the Thai interpreter because he was illiterate and being from a remote village in Northern Thailand, where a different dialect was used. He even said that he was forced to make the statements after being assaulted by the police interrogators during questioning. After a lengthy trial-within-a-trial, the two judges admitted the oral statements of all three men as evidence. They also accept the written statements of Wan and Vasavan, but reject Phan's written statements in view of his illiteracy. The defence's case When it comes to the defendants to give their testimonies to the court, all three accused put up a common defence - they did not deny being at the flat. They said that they only intended to beat up Tan Tik Siah, and all pinpointed the missing Ah Poo as the sole member of the four who strangled Tan to death with the rope procured by Vasavan. Despite giving a common defence, they gave three different versions of what exactly happened at the flat. = Phan's testimony = Phan was the first of the three to go onto the stand to testify. Phan said that Vasavan asked him to help assault a Chinese man who molested his daughter. He said that no monetary terms were discussed. According to Phan, on that night itself, he brought along both Ah Poo and Wan after agreeing with Vasavan to assist him in the assault. After arriving at Tan's flat, Phan said all four of them hid in Tan's bedroom and waited in ambush until Tan arrived home. Ah Poo was the first to attack Tan in his study room, followed by Phan and Vasavan, and finally Wan. Later, after he assaulted Tan, Phan said he left the room out of increasing fear to join Wan, who left the room first. He said that Vasavan also followed them. Ah Poo was the last to leave the room. = Wan's testimony = Wan's testimony was largely similar to Phan's. He said that when he first met Vasavan for drinks with Phan and Ah Poo, he did not know about their plans to assault Tan, and simply followed the others till they reached Tan's flat. He said that it was only then they arrived and entered the apartment he was informed that they were going to beat up Tan. Wan said that he reluctantly agreed to help since he had followed them. He said Ah Poo first attacked Tan before Phan and Vasavan joined in. Wan, who was the last to join, said that he was shocked and scared after witnessing the assault. For this, he left the room first, and he was followed by Phan and later Vasavan. Similar to Phan's testimony, Wan said that Ah Poo was the last to leave the room and had stayed in the room the longest. In the lift on the way down, Wan said that Vasavan paid the three of them $1,000 each; he said he initially did not accept the money but Ah Poo insisted and shoved it into his hand. = Vasavan's testimony = Vasavan was the last of the accused to go onto the stand. Vasavan not only denied that he had any motive or intention to murder Tan, he claimed to be suffering from acute severe reactive depression. Veronica Sathiadew, Vasavan's 20-year-old daughter, corroborated this evidence, saying that ever since her mother's affair with her uncle Tan Tik Siah came to light, her father became very reserved and locked himself in his room. There were also frequent quarrels between her parents, according to Veronica, who also added that her father would throw things around and even slapped her mother. It is not known if Vasavan's unnamed son went to court to testify for his father. It was only then a sense of peace returned to the family when Vasavan began going to church, but the arguments began again in early 1984 when Lee Chee Poh telephoned him frequently about his and her marital issues. Dr Wong Yip Chong, a notable psychiatrist, testified on the stand to support Vasavan's defence of diminshed responsibility, stating that Vasavan was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the crime. However, Dr Wong told the court that he did not believe his patient Vasavan when he said his intention was just to beat up, not kill, Tan Tik Siah. When asked by one of the two judges, Justice Sinnathuray if he had came across a case or medical evidence of diminished responsibility being raised when the accused was not present at the actual killing, Dr Wong conceded that he had not. Vasavan also told the court of how he came to know about the affair, as well as some aspects of his early life after his adoption and before the devastating events. He said that in 1959, when he was drove out of the house by his birth father, he was adopted by Mdm Sim (Tan's biological mother), who raised him as her own. For this, he grew attached to his foster mother and still loved her even till now. He also grew close to the three Tan brothers, especially with Tan Tik Siah, with whom he was closer than brothers, deeply loved each other, wore the same clothes that matched, and even joining the army together in the same year of 1963 before Vasavan himself left to pursue a freelance singing career, which brought him to Sabah and Bangkok. During his time as a singer, he first met Amnoi in Bangkok before marrying her in August 1968. Upon his return to Singapore, Vasavan joined the Taylor Woodrow as a foreman in a construction site in 1970; he left the company in 1974 before he re-joined two years later. He said that in one particular night, when he showed his wife the family album and photographs of the victim Tan Tik Siah, Vasavan asked his wife if his foster brother was handsome; it was then he realised something was amiss when he heard Amnoi answering to him that Tan looked ugly and was more uglier without his pants on when he slept with her, and he discovered his wife's 11-year-long affair with Tan after further questioning. Amnoi, who denied that she had an affair while testifying in court, told Vasavan that night she did so because of a wife-swopping arrangement which Tan told her about, an arrangement Tan claimed to have made with Vasavan. Vasavan, who in fact did not have any sexual encounter with his sister-in-law and never made such an arrangement with Tan, felt betrayed and deceived about it and confronted Tan (who denied the affair) about it. This led to the deterioration of the brothers' relationship and that of Vasavan and his wife, and Vasavan said that he felt that his whole world had crumbled and could see his wife and Tan on bed together, having sex, which made him see Tan as a \\"desperately indecent sex maniac\\". He not only argued with Amnoi frequently, he became suspicious of her movements and also contemplated suicide twice in the first three months after discovering Tan's treachery. Vasavan additionally denied that he first suggested to Lee to kill her husband or using black magic to kill Tan. He insisted that he had no intention to cause Tan's death and only told the three Thais, whom he recruited, to beat up Tan and not to kill him. He also said he did not buy the rope used to strangle Tan to death beforehand and said he did so at the spur of the moment (for the purpose to tie up Tan before assaulting him instead of strangulation). He said that he did not conspire with Lee or the others to kill Tan, and only told the Thais to help him beat up Tan under the pretext of his daughter being molested by a man, whom he did not name but pointed out as Tan. When cross-examined by the lawyers of Phan and Wan, he said the meeting with Phan was not pre- arranged and the plan to buy the rope was not carried out before 24 October 1984. When cross-examined by Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Bala Reddy, who led the prosecuting team, Vasavan denied the fact that he confessed to the police about his plan to kill Tan when DPP Reddy pointed out what he said in his oral and police statements. He insisted that he only wanted to beat up the victim and not to cause death. He denied any part in the killing and reiterated his denial of his motive to murder Tan to avenge himself for the adultery between Tan and Amnoi. The trial lasted for 45 days. Judgement was reserved until 6 October 1989. Verdict On 6 October 1989, nearly 5 years after the murder of Tan Tik Siah, the High Court was ready with the verdict, with Judicial Commissioner (JC) Joseph Grimberg delivering the verdict. In their 82-page judgement, which took 90 minutes to read, both JC Grimberg and Justice Sinnathuray found all the three men guilty of murder and sentenced them to death. JC Grimberg said in court that from their determination, there was no doubt that all the three men, together with the missing Ah Poo, had a common intention to attack and strangle Tan and all had done so in Tan's study. They rejected the defences of all three men that they had only intend to beat up Tan and not to kill. In his own words, JC Grimberg said, \\"At some stage, one of the assailants sat upon Tan's chest, and as he struggled and fought back, a rope procured by Vasavan was double looped round his neck three times and pulled extremely tight by at least two, probably by all four, of the attackers, and secured in a tight knot. The consequent intense constricting force caused fractures to the horns of Tan's thyroid cartilage, bringing about Tan's death by asphyxia, within two or three minutes\\", citing the autopsy report by the pathologist Clarence Tan. JC Grimberg also said they did not believe that Vasavan was indeed suffering from any depression at the time of the murder. They also said that in accordance to the plan and his awareness of Tan's martial arts knowledge and physical strength, Vasavan had hired the three Thais to do the job. They also pointed that after they murdered Tan, Vasavan had paid the Thais $1,000 each for their completion of the task, and even further arranged for an additional payment of $1,500 to Phan, who was set to leave Singapore for Thailand shortly after the crime, before their arrests. Even though they regarded her as an accomplice, the judges accepted Lee Chee Poh as a truthful witness and accepted her testimony against her brother-in- law and the two Thais. As the death sentence was passed upon them in a packed courtroom, both Vasavan and Phan were reportedly calm while Wan wiped his tears. Vasavan's daughter Veronica broke down and wept after seeing her father being sentenced to death. It is not known whether the other members of the Tan family, Lee Chee Poh, Tan's mistress Thereisa Lee, or the families of Phan and Wan were present at the courtroom when the sentence was passed. Appeal and execution: Aftermath After they were convicted and sentenced to death, all three men - Vasavan Sathiadew, Phan Khenapim and Wan Phatong - appealed against their sentences and in November 1991, the Court of Appeal of Singapore reserved their judgement after hearing the appeals. On 16 April 1992, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals. This decision effectively finalized the death sentences of the three men and setting them to hang for the murder. It is not known if all three men had appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from London against their sentences or to the President of Singapore for clemency; if they did, it is most probable that their appeals were dismissed. On 23 October 1992, almost 8 years after the murder of Tan Tik Siah, the three men - Vasavan, Phan and Wan - were all hanged in Changi Prison. Vasavan's body was collected by his daughter Veronica, while the corpses of Phan and Wan were received by no one; it is not known over what was done about their corpses. There is nothing more known about the subsequent lives of Lee Chee Poh, the remaining loved ones of Vasavan and Tan Tik Siah, as well as the fates of Tan's mistress Thereisa Lee and the unnamed illegitimate son whom Tan and his mistress bore out of wedlock. Six years later, on 23 October 1998, the date of Vasavan and his accomplices' sixth death anniversary, another convicted murderer, 20-year-old Malaysian youth and male prostitute Lim Chin Chong was coincidentally hanged on that same date of 23 October for the 1997 murder of his 65-year-old employer and male brothel operator Phillip Low Cheng Quee. This case was re-enacted in a Singaporean crime show named True Files. It first aired as the eleventh episode of the show's second season on 4 November 2003. It is currently available on meWATCH from 5 February 2016 onwards. As of today, Ah Poo, the third Thai accomplice and final culprit of the murder, was never found.

Moore, who was born in Belfast, wrote his first fiction in Canada, where he lived from 1948 to 1958. His earliest books were thrillers, published under his own name or using the pseudonyms Bernard Mara or Michael Bryan. The first two of these pieces of pulp fiction, all of which he later disowned, were published in Canada by Harlequin ‚Äì Wreath for a Redhead in March 1951 and The Executioners later in 1951. Arguably the most significant of these early works is Intent to Kill (written by Moore as \\"Michael Bryan\\" and published in 1957) which was adapted into a film of the same name, released in 1958. In the film noir genre, it was directed by Jack Cardiff and starred Richard Todd, Betsy Drake and Herbert Lom. In a reappraisal of the novel, Canadian literature historian Brian Busby says: \\"Care went into it composition. Most writers would take pride in having their name on its cover, but then so very few writers can compare to Moore\\". Busby is also complimentary about Moore's final pulp fiction work, Murder in Majorca, for which the working title was Free Ride Home, describing it as \\"one of the finest thrillers going. He shows off his talent by telling the story from various points of view.\\" Moore returned to the thriller genre years later with his novels The Colour of Blood (1987), Lies of Silence (1990) and The Statement (1995).

It is one of the earliest mosques in the country. The mosque is a large building, built next to a river and residential neighbourhood, with a minaret, and community facilities. Associated with the Albanian Australian community, the mosque is owned by and the centre of the Albanian Sakie Islamic Society of Dandenong. History Albanian immigrants mainly from Ki≈°ava (), a village in south-western North Macedonia arrived and settled in Dandenong from the early 1960s onward and over many decades became a large and concentrated community living in the area. A mosque was built and opened in 1968. At the mosque, Albanians are in charge of administrative functions, whereas the Islamic Association of Australia, an organisation with multicultural members also uses the premises. Mosque membership is mainly composed of Albanians with a Ki≈°ava origin. The committee of the Dandenong Albanian Sakie Islamic Society, an influential organisation among Dandenong Albanians, has it stipulated in the mosque constitution that only individuals with Ki≈°ava Albanian origins can be on its board. The mosque holds sway over the provision of services conducted by the imam, such as Islamic prayers, Sunday school, and undertaking other events (circumcisions, weddings, funerals and so on). Only people with membership can have a funeral at the mosque, although exceptions have occurred for other non- Albanian Muslims. Albanians in Dandenong are secular or non-observant Muslims, with a few devout in Islam. In the early twenty first century, regular attendance to the mosque consists of a small number of Albanian men. The rest of the congregation are mainly Turks, some Afghans and Muslims from other backgrounds. Few women, often elderly, go to the mosque, unless in the event of a funeral where attendance increases especially if it is of a woman. According to community members, low attendance by local Albanians is due to work and raising children preoccupying people and making it difficult to visit the mosque and pray. Individuals attending mosque school are from a non- Albanian background. Mosque sermons are mainly conducted in the Albanian language, with some English for non-Albanian Muslim worshipers.

Location of Thana Sadar on the bank of Surma river on Jaintapur-Zakiganj road. On the border of the Indian state of Meghalaya. Due to its location, Kanaighat was militarily important to both the Mukti Bahini and the Pakistan Army in 1971. Kanaighat was a stronghold of the Pakistan Army. Their 31st Punjab Regiment was engaged in defense. There were also militias and razakars. This was the front line of defense of the Pakistan Army in late November. Because, at that time the front area of Kanaighat was occupied by the freedom fighters of Zakiganj, Atgram and Chargram. After capturing Zakiganj, Atgram and Chargram, the freedom fighters continued to advance towards Sylhet. Liaquat Ali Khan was in this group of freedom fighters. On November 25, they reached Gauripur, two miles from the Kanaighat police station headquarters. They were divided into several groups. They took up positions at various places in Gauripur for the purpose of attacking Kanaighat. On the morning of 26 November, the Pakistan Army suddenly attacked a group of freedom fighters (Alpha Company). In such a situation, there is no other way but counter-attack. The freedom fighters bravely faced the onslaught of the Pakistan army. But even after fighting valiantly, their condition became fragile. Captain Mahbubur Rahman (Bir Uttam) was the captain of the affected freedom fighters. He was resolutely fighting the attack with his comrades. But at one stage he was martyred by the Pakistani army. In this situation Liaquat Ali Khan became the captain on the battlefield. At one stage he was also wounded by enemy bullets. This battle is described in the statement of Captain Hafizuddin Ahmed (Bir Bikram, later Major). \\"In the morning, the Pakistani 31st Punjab Regiment attacked our 'A' company position,\\" he said. Company 'A' thwarted the Pakistani attack with utmost determination. In this battle 100 soldiers including a major and a captain of the enemy were killed. On our side, 10-11 people including Captain Mahbub were martyred and about 20 people were injured. After the martyrdom of Captain Mahbub, Flight Lieutenant Liaquat Ali was appointed the commander of the company. He was a former Pakistan Air Force pilot.

The building contains a minaret, and an adjacent hall used for community functions that houses the library and visitors room. Associated with the Albanian Australian community, the mosque (built late 1960s) is owned by and the centre of the Albanian Australian Moslem Society (Mareeba Islamic Society). History In Mareeba, most of the Muslim population is composed of Albanian Australians, many from Albania (Kor√ß√´ region), others from Kosovo and Montenegro. Beginning in the interwar period Albanian immigrants arrived and following the Second World War, Bosniaks, Tatars and other Albanians settled in North Queensland in areas where sugar cane was grown like Cairns. The local Albanian community devoted its efforts toward preserving traditional values and their transmission, especially since they came from Albania where religion was strongly suppressed by the communist government. They sought to establish Islamic institutions and structures they had left in their homeland. Led by an Albanian imam from Cairo, new Albanian arrivals to Mareeba formed an organisation, the Albanian Australian Moslem Society (Mareeba Islamic Society) in 1953. A house was bought by the society and repurposed into a mosque. At the time, some 70 Muslim households from multicultural backgrounds lived in Mareeba. The project to build a mosque began with land bought by the Islamic Society for $4,000 in 1968 on the corner of Walsh and Lloyd Street, followed by construction (1969). The Mareeba Muslim community provided finances for the entire process of buying, planning and building a mosque. Assistance came from Tom Roy, a Mareeba architect who designed the mosque and Patty Cannon, a local builder that constructed it. The Islamic Society's budget lacked funds for a minaret and Islamic arch, and Cannon added them from his own accord with the minaret being an imitation, serving only as a design feature. A new modern brick building replaced the previous house serving as a mosque. Among the Albanian communities within Australia, reverence is maintained for its contribution to the World War Two effort and its Australian war veterans. On Anzac day, 1970, the Mareeba mayor opened the new mosque and it was dedicated to Australian soldiers who died in war. An inscription was added by the Albanian community as an expression of its desire to forge close ties with the wider local population. It reads: \\"Mareeba and District Memorial Mosque, Erected by the Albanian Australian Moslem Society: This house of God is dedicated to those who gave their lives in the defence of Australia and in appreciation of all who served. 'Lest We Forget' 25th April, 1970\\". Attached to the front mosque brick wall (left side), the inscription is a war memorial and part of the Mareeba Shire War Memorial Heritage Asset List. Shortly after the mosque opening, the Mareeba imam was granted the ability to register marriages. As part of closer relations, the wider community gave an area of the Mareeba cemetery to the Muslim community for burials and graves, that face westward in accordance with Islamic tradition. The mosque since its establishment has become a centre for the local Muslim community. By 1986, the Muslim membership of the Mareeba Islamic Society numbered some 300 people. A hall was added (1988) to the mosque toward the rear end of the premises for celebratory events and Muslim functions, that includes a visitors room and library. In the early twenty first century, parts of the Mareeba Albanian community are either third, fifth or sixth generation locals. The mosque serves as a focal point for the Albanian community that assists in preserving family traditions and religious identity. The 40 year anniversary of the mosque was celebrated in 2010. In September 2014, the word \\"evil\\" was sprayed on the Mareeba mosque and the incident was blamed on anti-Muslim backlash over anti-terrorism police raids in Brisbane and Sydney. The Mareeba mosque has participated in National Mosque Open Day, held across Australia for members of the general public to visit, support or acquaint themselves with Islam and Muslims. Mareeba Islamic Society's members are mainly farmers. In the early twenty first century, the mosque congregation is multicultural, composed of locally well established Albanians and newer Muslim arrivals from Kosovo, Bosnia, Uzbekistan and Turkey. The Albanian imam provides weekly lessons and lectures, with other Islamic lessons conducted on the weekend. Beginning from the early 2000s, the current serving imam is Benjamin Murat.

Location The 33 kilo Volt power line starts at the Umeme Limited (Umeme) 33kV substation at Mbale, Mbale District, in Uganda's Eastern Region. The power line travels in a general north-easterly direction to the town of Bulambuli, in Bulambuli District, a distance of about . From there, the power line takes a general easterly direction to end at Siti II Hydroelectric Power Station, a distance of about , by road from Bulambuli. Due to the steep terrain, the power line does not always follow the winding road. The line measures only , from Mbale to Siti II Power Station. Overview The power line is being developed to evacuate the 16.5 megawatts of electricity generated at Siti II Hydroelectric Power Station and transmit it to Mbale were it will be distributed to industrial, commercial and domestic customers. Siti II Power Station is expected online in the 3rd quarter of 2020. The metropolis of Mbale attained city status on 1 July 2020. Before that, their electricity consumption was no more than 20 megawatts. In 2019, peak demand in Mbale increased by 5 percent. This transmission line together with other distribution enhancements within the city, will result in the availability of 61 megawatts of electricity by December 2020. Associated power infrastructure As part of this power line, Umeme is also installing a switching station and plant house at its existing Mbale substation. In addition, it is installing capacitor banks, aimed at stabilizing the power supply. Another large infrastructure development in Mbale, is the creation of Tangshan Mbale Industrial Park. The park, which sits on will host 60 to 80 factories when fully developed. Its peak consumption is calculated at 220 megawatts of electricity at full capacity. Umeme is construction a 33 kilo Volt transmission line, measuring long, from Tororo to Tangshan Mbale Industrial Park, delivering 25 megawatts of electricity. Umeme is also constructing a switching station and plant house within the industrial park, to stabilize the electricity to industrial standards. The electricity distributor utility is also constructing a distribution network within the park measuring . At a later date, Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) plans to develop the 132kV Mbale‚ÄìBulambuli High Voltage Power Line, at which time the 33kV medium voltage line will plug into the high voltage line, for better stability of the network. Cost and construction The power line and associated infrastructure developments are budgeted at US$9.23 million (UShs34 billion). Construction started in June 2019 and is expected to conclude in August 2020. The Tangshan Mbale Industrial Park Project will cost US$5.99 million (UShs22 billion). Work started in May 2020, with completion expected in December 2020. Funding is provided 100 percent by Umeme Limited.

The almost complete skeleton of the animal was discovered in Sch√∂ningen in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was found during archaeological investigations in an excavation site in the Sch√∂ningen opencast mine. ulna and radius History Drawing based life restoration of Palaeoloxodon antiquus In general, P. antiquus was a large representative of the elephants , which could reach a weight of more than ten tons with a shoulder height of over four meters. During the last warm periods of the Pleistocene , this species reached areas north of the Alps and can also be found in Central Europe . Finds located particularly far to the north are documented not only from individual remains from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Lower Saxony. Specimen Lower jaw of Sch√∂ningen P. antiquus Excavation director Jordi Serangeli and the head of the Sch√∂ningen research station Nicholas J. Conard, at the discovery site on the spear base to the Lower Saxony with Minister of Science Bj√∂rn Th√ºmler Layer Sch√∂ningen 13 II silting sequence 3 in which the P. antiquus was found The P. antiquus is probably a female with a shoulder height of approximately and weight around 6.8 tons. During the excavation, 300 bones and a total of 700 bone parts were recovered, spread over an area of around . The finds include the 2.3 meter long tusks, the lower jaw, vertebrae and ribs, as well as the bones of three legs and the entire hyoid bone. The skeletal parts were largely in an anatomically correct arrangement. Various parts were missing, such as the pelvis, the left front leg with the shoulder blade and the foot bones of two legs. The preservation of the bones is mostly very good, only the more than one meter high skull of the individual had disintegrated into hundreds of small parts. This was caused by the comparatively light construction of the skull, which, like all elephants, consists of numerous air-filled and honeycomb-like hollow chambers. Overall, the animal lay parallel to the former lake shore with the head in the north and the rear in the south. The age of the animal is estimated to be around 50 years due to the worn teeth and osteoarthritis of the bones. Bite marks on the bones indicate that predators fed on the P. antiquus after death. Although no traces of human processing were found on the bones, there are indications of the presence of humans on the carcass. So were between the bone about 30 haircuts of flints that the sharpening stone tools emerge. In addition, two bone artifacts were found that were used as tools by humans and had impact marks. These are the foot bones of a red deer and another approximately long piece of bone from an unidentified animal. Early studies As a result of the ongoing excavations in the Sch√∂ningen opencast mine, it is known that there were a great variety of animals present 300,000 years ago during the Reinsdorf warm period, a special characteristic of the Holstein warm period. Around 20 species of large mammals lived there in the vicinity of a former shallow lake, including lions, bears, saber-toothed cats, rhinos, giant deer, aurochs, steppe bison, wild horses and other ungulates. About 100 meters from the place where the P. antiquus was found, footprints from a herd of elephants with adult and younger animals were discovered in the sediments of the former lake, which is unique in Germany. The herd ran parallel to the lake shore and left prints up to in diameter. Excavation site The site of the P. antiquus skeleton, Sch√∂ningen 13 II silting sequence 3 lies at a depth of about below the original mine surface and about below the horizon of the Sch√∂ningen spears (Sch√∂ningen 13 II silting sequence 4). It is located on the edge of the open pit on a plinth, which was left out of the mining by Braunschweigische Kohlen-Bergwerke AG. The base protrudes into the open pit on three sides. The area, also known as the spear pedestal, is one of several Paleolithic sites in the mine that were discovered in the course of prospecting of the quaternary layers from 1992 onwards. The approximately 3900 m¬≤ excavation base represents a small section of the shore zone of a former shallow lake, which was visited by humans and animals over thousands of years during the Reinsdorf warm period (approx. 320,000 to approx. 300,000 years ago). The base has five thick layers of layers (silting zones) that were created by fluctuating water levels in the lake and silting processes. Conservation efforts Like the previous archaeological finds in the Pleistocene deposits within the open pit in Sch√∂ningen, the bones, embedded in the mud layers of the silted lake, were preserved. The calcareous water of the lake brought in through streams from the nearby Elm, the airtight covering of the find layer by Mudden and the permanent location under the groundwater level , which was only artificially lowered by the Sch√∂ningen opencast mine, creating favorable preservation conditions for organic material. Site analysis According to the excavation manager Jordi Serangeli from the Senckenberg Research Station Sch√∂ningen, there is no evidence that Homo heidelbergensis, which lived at the time, killed the P. antiquus in the course of a hunt. People from the Paleolithic Age (as evidenced by the 300,000 year old Sch√∂ningen spears from the same site) were successful hunters, but there was no compelling reason for them to hunt adult elephants and put themselves in danger. The scientists assume that the animal died of old age. The site is on the bank of a former lake. It is known of today's elephants that old or sick animals are often near the water. The archaeologists see the association of flint fragments and bone tools with the elephant bones as evidence that people were right next to the carcass. With their tools they are likely to have cut out the flesh, tendons and fatty tissue of the dead animal in order to use it as a source of food and material. Research Conservation of a P. antiquus molar in the Sch√∂ningen research museum Replica of a P. antiquus on the edge of the Elm forest at Sch√∂ningen After the discovery of the P. antiquus skeleton at Sch√∂ningen in September 2017, the exposure took almost two years. It was carried out by archaeologists from the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Paleoenvironment at the University of T√ºbingen in cooperation with the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation. The scientists announced the discovery publicly in May 2020 at a press conference with the Lower Saxony Minister of Science Bj√∂rn Th√ºmler in Sch√∂ningen. At that point in time, the examination and conservation of the bones had not yet been completed. That took place in the Sch√∂ningen Research Museum, which was directly connected to the excavations and is about 300 meters away from the site. The fossils of at least ten P. antiquus have been found in the Sch√∂ningen opencast mine since the excavations began in the 1980s. These were individual finds of ribs, tusks or vertebrae that had to be hurriedly recovered from the approaching bucket wheel excavator during rescue excavations. The P. antiquus discovered in 2017 is the only almost completely preserved skeleton. Since the site is in the open-cast mining area on the preserved spear base, the recovery took place without time pressure in close consultation with the conservation workshop of the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation. Further analyzes of the environmental and climatic conditions at the time of death of the animal, as well as the sedimentation processes of the former lake, are carried out by the Technical University of Braunschweig, the University of L√ºneburg and the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. These sediment samples were analyzed for micro-fauna, micro- morphology, Limnology and Paleobotany. Due to the findings of elephant bones in the open pit, the life-size replica of a P. antiquus was erected above Sch√∂ningen in 2018. It stands on the edge of the Elm forest next to an excursion restaurant and is also used for tourist purposes. The reconstruction was made on the basis of a skeleton found at the Neumark-Nord site in Geisel valley, Saxony-Anhalt. For the year 2022, the President of the Lower Saxony State Office for the Preservation of Monuments, Christina Krafczyk, announced an exhibition with a focus on P. antiquus at the Sch√∂ningen Research Museum. Related findings=Earlier finds from Sch√∂ningen  Remains of P. antiquus around 300,000 years old were found in the Sch√∂ningen opencast mine at Sch√∂ningen 12 as early as the 1990s, including individual tusks and lamellas.Van Kolfschoten, T. (1993). Die Vertebraten des Interglazials von Sch√∂ningen 12B. Ethnographisch-Archaologische Zeitschrift, 34(4), 623-628. The same area of discovery also contained almost two dozen remains of P. antiquus from at least three individuals that were excavated between 2008 and 2009. This includes the tip of a tusk. It shows signs of polishing and may have served as a tool. Regional and national comparisons  Complete skeletons of P. antiquus are relatively rare, especially in Central Europe, the animals usually appear at the various sites in the form of remains of teeth and teeth or individual bones. One of the best-known finds and the next youngest evidence of P. antiquus in Lower Saxony is also offered by the lance of Lehringen, near Verden. The animal perished in a hunting event in the last warm period (Eem warm period) about 120,000 years ago. During this time of the Middle Paleolithic, the Neanderthals lived in Europe. In addition to the lance, which was stuck under or between the ribs of the animal, there were also 27 sharp-edged flint fragments in the vicinity, which were apparently produced on site at short notice. Since the animal had collapsed in the water, the people of that time could neither dismantle the entire carcass, nor recover the lance mentioned above.Karl Dietrich Adam: Der Waldelefant von Lehringen ‚Äì eine Jagdbeute des diluvialen Menschen. Quart√§r 5, 1951, S. 79‚Äì92 From a supra-regional perspective, the old find of P. antiquus from Gr√∂bern in Saxony-Anhalt, which is comparable to Lehringen, is significant. There, too, the bank of a former lake hid a complete skeleton, which reconstructs a fully grown male with a shoulder height of around 4.2 meters represents. The almost 200 bones of the elephant were distributed over an area of 20 square meters and were largely still in the anatomical association. There were only major remnants on the skull, chest and hind extremities. In direct connection, a good two dozen flint fragments were found in Gr√∂bern, mostly between the bones. Similar to Lehringen, it is assumed that the people of that time were only able to recover parts of the carcassErfurt, J. & Mania, D., (1990).

Ver√∂ffentlichungen des Landesmuseums f√ºr Vorgeschichte in Halle 62 Halle/Saale, 2010, S. 361‚Äì374 Significant finds also came to light in the Geisel valley, Saxony-Anhalt. There, on the shores of a former lake, the Neumark-Nord 1 lake basin, skeletons of around 70 individuals of P. antiquus were found, some of them largely complete; they spread around the lake. The age of the lake basin is discussed and varies, depending on the view, from the penultimate warm period around 200,000 years ago to the last warm period. The numerous skeletal finds and good conservation conditions made it possible to pass on rarely proven bones such as the tongue and sternum. Individual animals showed pathological symptoms. Changes, for example in the form of hip dysplasia, stunted tusks or perforations, which could possibly be traced back to rival fights. The animals died a natural death, but were later tattered by large predators such as the also documented cave lion or the cave hyena. Individual skeletons were connected with large flint debris, which indicate activities of early humans. One of these artifacts, known as the ‚Äúcarving knife‚Äù, still had an organic residue that turned out to be oak bark extract.Maria Rita Palombo, Ebru Albayrak und Federica Marano: The straight- tusked Elephants from Neumark-Nord. A glance into a lost world. In: Harald Meller (Hrsg.): Elefantenreich ‚Äì Eine Fossilwelt in Europa. Halle/Saale, 2010, S. 219‚Äì251 Several partial skeletons of P. antiquus from the travertines of Bad Cannstatt in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, which probably belong to the penultimate warm period, have been documented from southern Germany. Among them is a fully grown bull, the skeleton of which was spread over an area of 25 square meters and which, due to the 122 centimeter long upper arm and 144 centimeter long thigh bone, had a shoulder height of around 4 meters. For most elephant remains, exposure to early humans can be ruled out. Rather, the animals died due to illness or of old age in the vicinity of the spring water. Question of the elephant hunt  Various archaeologists in Germany have dealt with the question of elephant hunting in the Paleolithic. Thorsten Uthmeier from FAU Erlangen-N√ºrnberg thinks regular elephant hunts are unlikely. With the assumed clan size of five to ten people and a shelf life of 30 days for meat, only animals with a weight of up to one ton, such as cattle, deer or horses, would be considered as game. Elephants would provide up to ten times more meat than the group could consume over the period. However, elephants are still hunted with spears by pygmies in the central African rainforest . Michael Baales from the Ruhr University considers the role of elephants to be important at some European sites, even if, despite the presence of cut marks, it cannot be clearly decided whether the animals were hunted or dead animals were eviscerated. After examining elephant remains, Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser from Johannes Gutenberg University. Mainz came to the conclusion that Stone Age material can prove the presence of humans in the vicinity of the sites. Nicholas J. Conard from the Eberhard Karls, University of T√ºbingen considers the role of elephants in the Paleolithic economy to be elusive.Jordi Serangeli: Sammler, J√§ger und ein toter Elefant in Sch√∂ningen. in: Arch√§ologie in Niedersachsen 19, 2016, S. 100‚Äì103 External links * Forschungsmuseum Sch√∂ningen under (NLD) *300,000 years old: elephant skeleton almost completely on NDR.de *Sensational find in the Helmstedt district: 300,000 year old forest elephant skeleton discovered on SAT.1 Regional *Discovery of the forest elephant and the step seals on YouTube References Category:Prehistoric elephants Category:Lower Saxony Category:Stone Age sites in Europe Category:Archaeological sites in Germany Category:Paleolithic Europe Category:Prehistoric animals of Europe ","title":"Sch√∂ningen forest elephant"},{"id":"64906412","text":"Alan Young (born 12 August 1983 in England) is an English retired footballer.In the final part of our series on the dark side of football Alan Young talk about dealing with a career-ending injury swindonadvertiser.co.ukAlan Young‚Äôs journey from footballer to money man themortgagelender.com References Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards category:Living people Category:1983 births Category:Swindon Town F.C. players ","title":"Alan Young (English footballer)"},{"id":"64906416","title":"2011 World Aesthetic Group Gymnastics Championships"},{"id":"64906420","text":"Neil Duram is an American politician from Montana.

He came to national attention in Australia during the Kosovo crisis (1999) where he served as an interlocutor between temporarily resettled Kosovo Albanian refugees and the Australian Federal Government. Life Erik Shaip Lloga was born in 1948 in Ohrid. His father was Lutfi Lloga. During the 1960s, Erik fled Yugoslavia to avoid military service (later sentenced 10 years in absentia). He went to London and migrated through the UK assisted passage scheme to Sydney and later Melbourne. Lloga found factory employment, attended and graduated from Melbourne University and was an activist within the Labor Party. He later worked in prominent roles in the public service related to welfare and social policy. For some years he was employed at the Brunswick Council working for the mayor regarding strategy planning in inner Melbourne. At Victoria University of Technology (VUT), Lloga became a Research Assistant in 1993. During the Kosovo crisis, Lloga became the spokesman for the Melbourne Albanian community. In Melbourne, Lloga was chairman of the North Carlton based Albania-Australia Community Association who was involved in temporarily resettling Kosovo Albanian refugees. He served as the personal interpreter for Australian prime minister John Howard during Operation Safe Haven and was an advisor to the Federal Government. Lloga became the main interlocutor and go between for Australian authorities and Kosovo refugees. Following the end of the war, the UNHCR declared Kosovo safe in July and the Australian government decided to return 3,900 refugees. Lloga opposed the government returning them and expressed concerns for their safety, especially those from areas neighbouring Kosovo still under Serb control. The refugees did a hunger strike and Lloga attempted to dissuade them from continuing and was sympathetic to their cause to delaying their return as there were vulnerable people at risk of death if back in their homeland. In early April 2000, the Kosovo refugees were sent back by Australia and Lloga accompanied them without any immigration officials. Lloga described his experience on Melbourne's 744 ABC radio. In Kosovo, Lloga took the refugees to local police stations and through his funds fed some of them, as Australian authorities provided no money to aid their return. Lloga took some refugees to aid agencies who were unprepared for their return. He did many radio interviews in a period of a week from Pristina describing how the Australian government left the refugees without assistance and in conditions of having to fend for themselves and a destitute state. A week later, Rehame media monitoring service reported that Lloga's radio interview's had influenced caller opinion resulting in a \\"massive swing\\" against the Australian government's refugee repatriations.

Early life  Maureen Molloy was born on in Ashfield, New South Wales in 1925 to John and Aileen Clifton. She was educated at Loreto Convent in Kirribilli, where she became head prefect and sports captain. She was awarded a bursary to study at University of Sydney and graduated with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in physics. She was the only female graduate in that year and was quickly appointed as a lecturer in physics at the university. After meeting John Molloy at the university and falling in love, they married in 1950 and moved to New Caledonia for four years to support his career with Mobil Oil. She had seven children between 1951 and 1963. The last child had a severe intellectual disability, which prompted her to study psychology at the University of Melbourne.  Career and studies  Studying psychology, Molloy gained a bachelor‚Äôs degree, master‚Äôs degree and PhD, with her studies increasingly focusing on the phenomenon of brain injuries and the effects and disturbances induced by such injuries. In the 1980s, she worked as a neuropsychologist at the Austin and St Vincent‚Äôs hospitals, while also working at the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Centre at Glen Waverley. Molloy set up the Cognitive Rehabilitation Centre in 1986, a medical practice to provide rehabilitation for people suffering brain injuries from transport and workplace accidents. She used computer-based tools to aid the brain's recovery from injury. She visited overseas centres to meet with international scholars in the field and published a book on the subject with Julie Ann Garner. In the 1990s, Molloy studied a Master of Science degree in cognitive neuroscience and focused on the use of artificial intelligence systems to model brain function. Her thesis focused upon the feasibility of developing a computer-based diagnostic advisory system with the potential to provide reliable assistance in the prediction of outcome for patients who had sustained head injuries. In the years after her thesis, she explored computer- generated options for assessing the neuroplasticity of the brain and models for assessing recovery from brain injury after traumatic injuries. In her own practice, Molloy began to specialise in the diagnosis and measurement of acquired brain injury and she became one of Australia‚Äôs leading private practitioners in the field. By the late 1990s, Molloy was regularly called to be an expert witness in litigation related to head injury, a common outcome of motor vehicle and workplace accidents. This led her to study a law degree, graduating at 80 years old. As Molloy‚Äôs forensic career developed, she became the favoured neuropsychologist for plaintiff lawyers in Victoria. She continued in practice until the year prior to her death, continuing to assess the nature and extent of brain injuries from diverse sources, including from heavy metal poisoning.  Maureen Molloy Medal  In 2017, the Maureen Molloy Prize in Clinical Neuropsychology was established at University of Melbourne as an award for the student with the highest average mark in the Master of Psychology (Clinical Neuropsychology) degree. The award is presented annually by the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences and the Molloy family.

It reviewed a sample of 150 patients who had sustained blunt trauma injury to the head and studied the sequelae of bilateral damage to their frontal-temporal-limbic structures. She concluded that deficits in the organisational aspects of memory are evidenced by tendencies to perseverate in errors and to lack flexibility in patterns of responding and in the feedback from errors, despite ongoing correction from such errors. This suggested to her the presence of cognition processing disorders related to attentional functions and to the organisational aspects of memory.

Together with the neighboring Bhojpur Jadid, it lends its name to the surrounding Bhojpuri region.  Name  The name \\"Bhojpur\\" is derived from the name of the Paramara dynasty king Bhoja, who reigned from Dhar and was a patron of the arts. \\"Kadim\\" is an Urdu word meaning \\"old\\". There is also the neighbouring village of Bhojpur Jadid, or \\"New\\" Bhojpur.  History  Bhojpur was the capital of the Ujjainiya rajas of Bhojpur. The Ujjainiyas, a Rajput clan that claimed ancestry from the Paramara dynasty that had ruled from Dhar and Ujjain, migrated to the Bhojpur region sometime around 1320. The founding figure, Sanatan or Santana Sahi, came to settle in the village of Karur in the pargana of Danwar at that time, while returning from a pilgrimage to Gaya. Before this, the region was ruled by the Chero dynasty. The region was heavily forested at that time, and the coming of the Ujjainiyas coincided with the clearing of much of this forest to make room for large-scale agriculture. Sanatan Sahi died around 1360 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Hunkar Sahi. Upon his accession, the Cheros under his rule revolted. Hunkar Sahi defeated them in a military campaign, with both sides taking heavy losses. One of the main Chero strongholds in the area was Bihiya, ruled by one Mahipaldev; Hunkar Sahi conquered Bihiya from him, and after this faced little opposition. He made Bihiya his capital and constructed new buildings there. Later generations would justify the conquest with a legend that Hunkar Sahi pledged devotion to the Muslim holy man Hazrat Sharifuddin Maneri after witnessing one of his miracles; in turn, Hazrat Sharifuddin Maneri declared Hunkar Sahi the rightful ruler of Bihiya. Hunkar Sahi died in 1410 and was succeeded by his son Dev Sahi, who was still a minor. As such, the boy's uncle, Ishwar Sahi, was appointed regent. Later, though, Dev Sahi reputedly went insane and was replaced by his younger brother Dullah Sahi, who moved his capital to Dawan (or \\"Dawa\\"), in the pargana of Bihiya. He died in 1484 at the age of 85 after a long reign. As his oldest son, Badal Sahi, was blind, a younger son ascended the throne as Ram Sahi. Ram Sahi continued to face opposition from the Chero tribes and attempted to impose social controls on them, banning them from arming themselves (except for hunting) and forbidding them from mingling with members of other tribes. His plan backfired ‚Äî now the tribesmen turned to brigandage against the Ujjainiyas. Ram Sahi attempted to reestablish his rule by building thanas on the banks of the Karmanasa River, but to little effect.  1500s  A clearer picture of the Bhojpur raj begins to emerge from the time of Raja Durlabh Deo, who ascended to the throne in 1489. This king had three wives and five sons: Badal Singh, Shivram Singh, Sangram Singh, Devendra Singh, and Mahipal Singh. In 1500, at the behest of his second wife, Durlabh Deo named Shivram Singh as his heir, which upset his other wives and sons. It was especially a snub to Badal Singh, the eldest son, who ended up leaving Bhojpur and venturing off in search of supporters. During this time, he met Farid Khan, the future Sher Shah Suri, who similarly had been driven from home. According to Bodhraj of Pugal, the two men became close friends and pledged to come to the other's assistance if he ever needed it. After Farid was given charge of Sasaram and Khawaspur Tanda in 1511, he helped restore Badal Singh to his aging father's good graces. Durlabh Deo died in 1519, and a bloody succession war broke out among his sons. Badal Singh and Mahipal Singh were both killed. Shivram Singh survived and became the sole ruler of Bhojpur, with his capital at Bihta. Later, in 1532, Badal Singh's widow met with Farid ‚Äî now known as Sher Khan ‚Äî and asked for assistance in raising her two sons (Gajpati Sahi, then 18, and Bairi Sal, then 15) to the throne. Sher Khan obliged and sent an army that, in 1534, defeated and killed Shivram Singh, and Gajpati Sahi became raja, with his seat at Jagdishpur. After this, Gajpati became a close ally of Sher Khan. In 1534, Sher Khan asked for Gajpati's assistance against Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah, the Sultan of Bengal, and Gajpati responded by mustering an army including 2,000 cavalrymen to aid him. At Surajgarh, their combined forces defeated those of the Sultan, with Gajpati killing the Sultan's commander Ibrahim Khan, and they seized the Bengal army's camp equipment, elephants, and artillery. Sher Khan, highly pleased, granted Gajpati the region of Buxar, and gave a sword to his younger brother, Bairi Sal. Meanwhile, the widow of Mahipal Singh, the other son of Durlabh Deo who had died in the 1519 succession war, sought assistance in raising her own son, Dalpati Sahi (aka Dalpat), to the Ujjainiya throne. She approached her brother Birbhan, of the pargana of Arail, Allahabad in the Allahabad Subah; he then in turn went to Humayun, the second Mughal emperor and a deep-seated rival of Sher Khan. In 1538, while Humayun was en route to Barkhnada in modern Palamau district, Birbhan met with him and Humayun agreed to provide him with troops. Birbhan was thus able to defeat Gajpati and install Dalpat on the throne in Jagdishpur. Indebted to Humayun, as Gajpati had been to Sher Khan, Birbhan sided with Humayun in his war against Sher Khan. After Humayun was defeated in the decisive Battle of Chausa against Sher Khan in 1539, Birbhan met with him and offered provisions. He helped Humayun escape pursuit by Sher Khan's general, Mir Farid Gaur, by crossing the Ganges near Mirzapur. In the meantime, the dispossessed Gajpati had again joined forces with Sher Khan, bringing a contingent of his own troops to the battle of Chausa. He probably played a significant role in the battle, although later Ujjainiya sources say nothing about the matter. Not long after, he attacked Bhojpur, apparently with Sher Khan's assistance, and overthrew Dalpat as ruler of Bhojpur. In addition, Sher Khan granted Gajpati the title of Raja as well as rule over the sarkars of Rohtas and Shahabad. Finally, Gajpati built a fortress at his capital of Jagdishpur. Under the Sur Empire that was established after Sher Shah's victory at Chausa, Bhojpur was at peace. Gajpati was able to consolidate his rule, expanding as far as the border of the sarkar of Jaunpur. By this point, he was the most powerful chief in northwestern Bihar. After Humayun's victory at the Battle of Sirhind in 1555 led to the downfall of the short-lived Sur Empire and the reestablishment of Mughal power in northern India, there was a possibility that the overthrown Dalpat would seek Humayun's assistance in retaking Bhojpur, but Humayun's sudden death after falling down a staircase prevented such an occurrence. Under Humayun's successor Akbar, Gajpati originally resisted Mughal power but later, in 1568-69, he submitted to Munim Khan, the governor of Jaunpur, and agreed to pay 500,000 rupees per year as malguzari. In early 1573, Munim Khan appointed Gajpati to a military command against the Bengal Sultan Daud Khan Karrani. A year later, Gajpati accompanied Akbar in an attack on Hajipur, but as soon as 1576 he was openly in rebellion against Mughal rule. He was defeated in battle near Ghazipur and fled back to the forests of Bhojpur, while the Mughal army commandeered the fort of Moheda, about 7 miles west of Bhojpur. Then, in 1575, they besieged Jagdishpur, where Gajpati had fled to. The siege lasted for three months before the fort surrendered, while Gajpati, along with his son Ram Singh and his brother Bairi Sal, escaped into the hilly forests nearby. Meanwhile, Dalpati Sahi, the son of Mahipal Singh who had briefly reigned in 1538-39 before being ousted by Gajpati, took advantage of the opportunity to press his claim. In 1577, he attacked Gajpati, who was killed in the following battle. At about the same time, Bairi Sal was killed in a Mughal surprise attack. Ram Singh fled to the Shergarh fort, but he soon surrendered to Shahbaz Khan. Dalpati Sahi, now the sole Ujjainiya ruler, was recognized by Akbar with the title of Raja and restored to his former possessions. Akbar also made Dalpat a mansabdar. In return, Dalpat was to provide Akbar with military support. Dalpat moved his capital from Jagdishpur to Bihiya, although Jagdishpur remained his main military stronghold. However, as early as 1580, Dalpati had already revolted. He had joined an existing rebellion in Bihar and Bengal led by an Afghan named Arab Bahadur, who had besieged Patna. He moved his capital to Bahuara in Piro, where he built a fort called Dalpatgarh. Akbar appointed Mirza Aziz Koka as governor of Bihar in order to quell the rebellion. Arab Bahadur realised that his siege would not capture Patna before Mughal reinforcements arrived and fled to Bhojpur, where Dalpati Sahi granted him refuge and reaffirmed his commitment to fight against the Mughals. Now joined by Shahbaz Khan, the Mughal army under Aziz Koka sacked Jagdishpur, but the two rebels fled to the jungles. There, they adopted guerilla tactics and killed many Mughal soldiers. The Mughal commanders, Aziz Koka and Shahbaz Khan, fell out with each other at this point, and Aziz Koka later left to join Todar Mal. Shahbaz Khan ordered the jungles cleared in an attempt to force the rebels out into the open. Meanwhile, Dalpati Sahi and Arab Bahadur attacked the fort of Kant and killed its commander, Saadat Ali Khan. Upon hearing of this, Shahbaz Khan immediately marched towards Kant and forced the rebels to flee to Sasaram, where they were defeated. Arab Bahadur fled to Saran, where he continued to harass the area before moving again to Jaunpur to join the rebels of Masum Khan Farankhudi. However, Dalpat submitted to the Mughals. For eight years, Dalpat remained compliant before in 1599 rebelled again. Daniyal Mirza, who had been appointed governor of Allahabad, was sent to subdue him. When Daniyal reached Hajipur, Dalpat submitted and presented him with a gift of elephants, but soon again rebelled. He was, however, captured and pardoned; the Akbarnama says that Dalpat's daughter was married to Daniyal and in 1604 she had a son named Farhang Hushang. Meanwhile, Dalpat was murdered by his own kin in 1601.  1600s  Upon Dalpat's death, his nephew Ram Sahi II assumed the throne, but Dalpat's son Mukutmani sought Akbar's assistance in becoming ruler instead. Mukutmani was physically very strong and impressed Akbar, who granted him the same mansab as his father; Akbar presumably hoped to pit the two claimants against each other. After Akbar died in 1605, Mukutmani returned to Bhojpur to rule. But he proved to be incompetent and unpopular, and in 1607 was forced to abdicate in favor of his nephew Narayan Mal. Narayan Mal then went to Agra and entered the service of Khurram, the future Shah Jahan. He didn't stay long, however ‚Äî a major Chero uprising in 1607 prompted him to go back to Bhojpur. The Cheros of Bhojpur were assisted by the Chero rajas of Kaddhar, Anandichak, Balaunja, and Lohardaga, among others. Narayan Mal received the assistance of one Rai Kalyan Singh, who had been sent by Jahangir with a force of 500 cavalry to help him. The decisive battle of this conflict took place at Buxar. At first, the Cheros were on the verge of routing when a large allied force came to reinforce them. The Ujjainias then likewise came to the verge of routing before the Mughal cavalry arrived to reinforce them. Eventually, the Cheros fled the battlefield after a rumour that more Mughal reinforcements were coming spread. Afterwards, Narayan Mal was granted the title of Raja and a mansab of 1,000/800. Narayan Mal died in 1624 and was succeeded by his younger brother Pratap Singh, who was granted the title of Raja by Jahangir, along with a mansab of 1,000/8000 (later raised to 1,500/1,000 by Shah Jahan). Pratap Singh moved his capital from Jagdishpur to Bhojpur Kadim, where he built a palace called Navratna. He then held an official post in Agra for about a decade, after which he returned to Bhojpur. Not long after that, he fell out with the imperial administration, who accused him of exploiting the peasants. Then they found out that he had not paid revenue for the past 9 years, and demanded that he pay the full sum immediately as well as present himself before the emperor and explain his conduct. Raja Pratap at first complied, travelling as far as Ayodhya before changing his mind and openly rebelling against the emperor. Shah Jahan sent the governor of Bihar, Abdullah Khan Firoz Jung, as well as the governor of Allahabad, Baqar Khan Najm Sani, to quell the rebellion. He also sent Fidai Khan, the jagirdar of Gorakhpur, and Mukhtar Khan, the faujdar of Munger, to march on Bhojpur. The combined armies captured the forts at Tribaq and Kalur, along with several others, and laid siege to Bhojpur. The siege lasted for six months before Raja Pratap finally surrendered. He was arrested and sent to Patna, where he was executed, probably at the city's western gate. For a time thereafter, Bhojpur was under direct Mughal rule. Amar Singh, the son of Narayan Mal, had been passed over in 1624 when his uncle Pratap Singh had instead inherited the throne. He made an appeal to the governor of Bihar that he should be restored to the throne, but was denied. However, after seeking the assistance of Shah Shuja, then the governor of Bengal, he succeeded in being granted the Bhojpur estate in 1648. He then moved his capital away from Bhojpur Kadim in favor of Mithila, 20 km southwest of Dumraon in present Buxar district. He built numerous buildings at Mithila, and the ruins of the old fort can still be seen at Bhojpur Kadim. During the ensuing succession war at the end of Shah Jahan's life, both Shah Shuja and Dara Shikoh sought Amar Singh's support, but since it was Shah Shuja who had helped Amar Singh obtain the Bhojpur raj, his decision was \\"a foregone conclusion\\". During the wars that followed, Amar Singh unwaveringly gave support to Shah Shuja, including at the Battle of Bahadurpur between the two brothers in February 1658. Shah Shuja expressed appreciation in several firmans to Amar Singh during the course of the year, and promised rewards and favours in return, but after his defeat by Aurangzeb at the Battle of Khajwa in 1659, he was chased out of India altogether and ended up dying in exile in Arakan. Amar Singh ended up switching allegiance to Aurangzeb, who continued to recognize his rank and titles, and he died in 1665 after a peaceful final few years. Amar Singh was succeeded by his oldest son, Rudra Singh, although he was not officially recognised by Aurangzeb as raja until 1682. In the meantime, Amar Singh's younger brother Prabal Singh had gone to Delhi and sought Aurangzeb's support in making him raja instead. According to local tradition, Aurangzeb offered to do so if Prabal Singh converted to Islam, which he did, but he was not given rule over Bhojpur. The reason is unclear, but possibly because Rudra Singh had already established himself as a capable and loyal young ruler. As compensation, the disgruntled Prabal Singh was granted a jagir in the pargana of Piro as well as the title of raja. He returned from Delhi in 1671 and died a year later. In 1681, Rudra Singh revolted. The coming of the rainy season delayed the Mughals' response, but in October they had marched on Mithila and burned it to the ground, confiscating Rudra Singh's estates and putting them under direct Mughal rule. Rudra Singh escaped to the forests and harassed the Mughals using guerilla tactics. Eventually, Safi Khan, the governor of Bihar and an old ally of Amar Singh's, approached Rudra Singh to negotiate a truce. Rudra Singh agreed to apologise for his rebellion and pay an indemnity of 130,000 rupees to the Mughal government, while in return he was granted a pardon and restoration of his father's rank and title. The rank and title were not finalised until April 1682. Around that time, Rudra Singh was also appointed faujdar of the sarkar of Shahabad, indicating that he had fully won back the confidence of the Mughal administration. He had been replaced by one Adiqat Khan by 1683, however. Rudra Singh was later given extensive jagirs with an annual revenue of over 200,000 rupees, along with the rights to collect revenues in the pargana of Kharid in Jaunpur. He moved his capital from the destroyed Mithila to Buxar, and died there in 1699 of poison. He was succeeded by his cousin Mandhata Singh, son of Prabal Singh, who moved the capital back to Mithila.  1700s  In 1745, Raja Horil Singh moved his capital to Dumraon, thus founding the Dumraon Raj; his nephews Buddh Singh and Udwant Singh founded the estates at Buxar and Jagdishpur.

The organizations are collectively creating a series of programming and exhibitions centered around feminist thought to be held beginning in the fall of 2020, during the run-up of the presidential election. The project was initially planned to occur from September through November 2020, but has been extended through the end of 2021 due to changes in exhibition schedules resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. History A feminist art initiative was conceived by Apsara DiQuinzio in early 2017 in response to the 2016 presidential election and the grassroots organization of the Women's March in Washington, D.C. that followed. DiQuinzio, a curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, in the lead up to the 2020 presidential election, planned a series of arts programming centering on feminist ideas. The concept for the FAC was largely inspired by the model of Getty's Pacific Standard Time. The Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts awarded a $50,000 curatorial grant to the Feminist Art Coalition in 2017, which provided the necessary funding to the working group to plan and shape the project together and the development of the website. In spring 2018, the working group of curators convened in Berkeley and a roundtable titled Feminist Curatorial Practices was held on campus, hosted by Julia Bryan-Wilson and the Arts Research Center; attendants of a colloquium in Berkeley included Adrienne Edwards, Rita Gonzalez, and Henriette Huldisch. The organizers of the Feminist Art Coalition have emphasized that the initiative is gender-inclusive and recognizes a plurality of different feminisms. Events The events scheduled to take place as part of the Feminist Art Coalition include exhibitions, symposiums, surveys, and performances that span from fall 2020 through the end of 2021. The Feminist Art Coalition maintains a complete listing of projects at www.feministartcoalition.org. Exhibitions Retrospective exhibitions are being held by several institutions, such as Joan Mitchell: Fierce Beauty co- presented by the Baltimore Museum of Art and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Andrea Bowers at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. Group exhibitions centering themes relevant to feminisms, such as voting rights, activism, domesticity, labor, and the body will also be presented at many institutions. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the Hammer Museum are hosting the exhibition Witch Hunt, which examines sociopolitical constructs through a feminist lens. The exhibition includes 15 international artists and was curated by Anne Ellegood and Connie Butler. Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA) will present New Time: Art and Feminisms in the 21st Century, a major survey exploring recent feminist practices in contemporary art. The exhibition will illuminate a diverse range of art across all mediums by artists of all genders who are integrating feminist thought into innovative artistic approaches across a wide array of themes. In addition to group exhibitions, a number of solo exhibitions are being held as a part of the coalition. Solo exhibitors include Howardena Pindell at The Shed, Fernanda Laguna at The Drawing Center and the Institute for Contemporary Art at Virginia Commonwealth University, Lynn Hershman Leeson at the New Museum, and Genesis Belanger at The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum. See www.feministartcoalition.org for a complete listing of exhibitions and projects.  Performances  GYOPO, a coalition of diasporic Korean artists, curators, writers, cultural producers, and art professionals, will present a Los Angeles marathon reading of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha‚Äôs seminal Dictee in conjunction with the University of Southern California. Also in Los Angeles, LAND (Los Angeles Nomadic Division) presents Gatherings, an exhibition of public sculptures, performances, and programs that reimagine public sculpture as conduits for nurturing artistic and contemplative practices.

He turned Demerara in a successful plantation colony, and the borders of Guyana are mainly based on his expeditions into the interior. He is also noted for his treatment of the Amerindians. Biography Laurens Storm van 's Gravesande was born in 's-Hertogenbosch in a patrician family who were hereditary members of the Council of Delft since 1270. At the age of 17, he joined the army. In October 1737, he started to work for the Dutch West India Company (WIC), the governing authority of the western colonies, and was assigned to Fort Zeelandia in Essequibo as a secretary. In 1738, he established the College of Kiezers, an electoral college for the colony. After the death of Hermanus Gelskerke, the Commander of Essequibo, Storm van 's Gravesande was appointed Commander of the colony on 13 April 1743. In 1745, Demerara was created as a separate colony, even though it was located on an unoccupied part of Essequibo, because the people from the province of Holland wanted to settle there and Essequibo was part of Zeeland. Demerara was initially governed from Essequibo. In 1750 he appointed his son Jonathan as Commander of Demerara. After a conflict with the West India Company, he left for the Netherlands, but was reappointed as Director General of Essequibo and Demerara in 1752. In Demerara he instituted an open-door policy. He befriended Gedney Clarke, a Barbados merchant and plantation owner who owned many plantations and had many contacts. In 1755, Clarke requested political representation, therefore as separate administration for Demerara was established of the island of Borsselen. The colony of Demerara started to flourish. In 1763, a slave uprising took place in neighbouring Berbice. Governor van 's Gravesande formed an alliance with the Amerindian tribes and prevented the uprising from spreading to his colonies. In 1763, he asked to be replaced, and repeated the request in 1766 and 1770, until he was finally replaced on 27 November 1772. On 14 August 1775, Laurens Storm van 's Gravesande died on his plantation Soesdyke. Legacy Storm van 's Gravesande started to focus on the economic development of the plantations instead of trade. Another focus was on exploration projects in the interior and setting up trade posts with the Amerindian. The current borders of Guyana as defined by Robert Hermann Schomburgk were mainly based on the reports of the explorations carried out during this period. Storm van 's Gravesande started an Amerindian policy based on respect and friendly relations, and forging alliances with the tribes during times of crisis. His open door policy resulted a majority of English and Scottish planters among the white population. Historians have often praised his rule of the colonies, however his reign was also marked by nepotism by appointing sons and sons-in-laws in important positions. His treatment of the Amerindians contrasted with the slaves. A telling anecdote is that on 9 August 1767, 20 slaves of his plantation Soesdyke made a failed attempt at escape. In his letters he wrote that he could not understand it, because they were well fed, and only punished for good reason.

Plot  Reid, who goes by the username \\"Fe@rLeSS_\\" is a teen video gamer who is an expert at the superhero action-adventure video game Planet Master. While battling in the second to last level of the video game, the video game protagonist Captain Lightspeed reveals he has three children, which he brought to the battle with him. In-game, Reid decides to drop them off at a daycare before he plays the final level of the game, where Lightspeed attaches an \\"interplanetary communicator\\" to one of the babies so the daycare workers can call Lightspeed in case of emergency. While in daycare, the antagonist Dr. Arcannis steals the babies and imprisons them on his spaceship in order to attempt to steal their superpowers so he can conquer Earth. While in captivity, the babies accidentally use their powers to escape, and end up mistakenly walking into an escape pod and launching it towards Earth in the real world. The United States Armed Forces, headed by General Blazerhatch, detects the aircraft which entered American airspace. The escape pod ends up crashing in front of Reid's home. Meanwhile, Melanie, Reid's school partner, arrives at his house to complete a science project together. Melanie and Reid are both shocked to discover the babies who have entered the home, and after Melania and Reid debate on what to do, Reid convinces her the babies came from his video game, and they decide to take care of them. Meanwhile, Dr. Arcannis has tracked the location of the babies to Reid's home, and the military brainstorms ideas on what to do. The following morning, Reid discovers the interplanetary communicator, and gets a call from Lightspeed, who explains that those are his babies and that he will track their location to retrieve them, also explaining that Dr. Arcannis is after them; one of the babies however accidentally steps on the communicator, breaking it and making Lightspeed unable to finish the location tracking. Melanie suggests to Reid that they have to get away from their home in order to stay safe, and the two do so. Dr. Arcannis arrives at the home after they left, vowing to find them. The military later captures Reid, Melanie and the babies, believing the babies to be dangerous aliens. Dr. Arcannis proceeds to arrive, and after defeating the military, steals the babies and transports them to his ship. Reid steals a motorcycle from the military in order to follow Dr. Arcannis' tracks, and Melanie fixes the interplanetary communicator by wiring it to a military handheld transceiver, and they manage to successfully contact Lightspeed, allowing Lightspeed to track their location, also informing him that Dr. Arcannis has stolen the babies. Reid and Melanie than successfully stowaway on Dr. Arcannis' ship. The ship lands at a major city, where the military awaits, and Melanie and Reid escape from the ship with an escape pod taking the babies with them, landing near the ship in the same city; Dr. Arcannis transforms into a larger and more powerful forms of himself, and unleashes his robot airforce which the military is unsuccessful at stopping, and as he approaches Melanie and Reid, the babies learn to control their superpowers and fightback, destroying the robot army and defeating Dr. Arcannis by destroying an electric device on his neck which gave him the power to become larger. Lightspeed arrives late after the battle finishes, and is relieved to find out the babies learned to use their superpowers, also hailing Reid and Melanie as heroes.

He was solo cellist of the Vienna State Opera, and played chamber music in the Amar Quartet. He stood often in the shadow of his famous brother Paul but was rediscovered in recent years as a composer of an opera, a piano concerto, chamber music and piano pieces.  Life  Born in Hanau, Rudolf Hindemith grew up with his brother Paul. They made music together early. From age 10, Rudolf took cello lessons at Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium in Frankfurt. He was engaged as solo cellist at the orchestra of the M√ºnchener Konzertverein (later the M√ºnchner Philharmoniker). From 1921 to 1924, he served in the same function in the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera, with conductors including Richard Strauss and Franz Schalk. Amar Quartet in 1925, with Rudolf Hindemith 2nd from left, Paul Hindemith 3rd from left The Hindemith brothers played in the Amar Quartet, one of the leading groups of the contemporary music scene of the 1920s, with Paul as violist and Rudolf as cellist. Rudolf soon dropped out, because he often felt set back behind Paul, and switched to the genres of brass music and jazz. While Paul emigrated from Nazi Germany to Switzerland in 1938, Rudolf remained and became a conductor. He led the symphony orchestra of the Generalgouvernement in Cracow, a project of Gauleiter Hans Frank. After the Second World War, Hindemith led a restless life as a composer, conductor and also educator, using numerous pseudonyms to avoid being addressed as Hindemith. In 1958, his opera Des Kaisers neue Kleider after Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes was premiered in Bremen, conducted by George Alexander Albrecht who had studied with Lofer without knowing his identity. Hindemith was married to Maria Landes-Hindemith, first his piano student, then professor of piano at the Musikhochschule M√ºnchen. Rudolf Hindemith died in isolation in 1974 in Neuperlach near Munich at the age of 74. His gravestone was inscribed with the pseudonym \\"Hans Lofer\\".  Work and rediscovery  In the 1990s, some of his students began to remember him more and more, even though he was considered a bizarre and sometimes cruel teacher. The musicologist Gerd Brill from the University of M√ºnster has begun a biography. A three-day Festival was held in Bremen in February 2001, presenting some of his piano pieces, chamber music and the premiere of his Piano Concerto from the 1960s, which he had entitled Suite for Piano and Orchestra. Soloist and the conducted by George Alexander Albrecht played the original work in five movements. In 2005, the pianist Stephanie Timoschek dedicated her thesis at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz to him and especially his piano works, which include 6 Dances, 7 Sonatinas, 5 Pieces, 7 Preludes and Fugues, 13 School Fugues, 27 Two-Part School Fugues and a waltz from his opera Des Kaisers neue Kleider.

In his last week in Paris, Hajali, together with Roger Fahr, another Lebanese musician, and a number of musicians from various countries, whose names were eventually lost, recorded his debut album, Mouasalt Ila Jacad El Ard. The record combined santur with the Western-style music with vocals, jazz guitars, and synthesizers. The texts were taken from Lebanese revolutionary poet Samih al-Qasim. The album was not properly released at the time and circulated on tapes, with estimated 100 copies. In Beirut, it came to an attention of musician Ziad Rahbani who popularized it. In 2019, the record was re-released by Habibi Funk. One of the compositions, Ana Damir El Motakallim, has been compared with Stairway to Heaven and described as innovative in Lebanese music.

Biography Elizabeth Poole was born on 5 April 1820 in Adam Street, Marylebone, London. She was the youngest daughter of John Lidbury Poole, the architect in charge of construction of the Royal Mint. Her mother (also Elizabeth) died when she was six, and she received her early musical education from an elder sister. Her first stage appearance was at the Olympic Theatre pantomime on Boxing Day 1827, emerging from an oyster-shell to sing ‚ÄòOysters, Sir‚Äô, to music by Rossini. Apprenticed in 1829 to the chorus master at Drury Lane, she enjoyed fame as a child prodigy and actress in London and Brighton. She played principal boy in Covent Garden pantomimes during the 1830s, and from 1836 began to appear in opera, beginning with Auber's The Bronze Horse at Drury Lane, where she also played a supporting role to Malibran in the premiere of Balfe's The Maid of Artois. Among many opera appearances, her teenage Donna Elvira in Mozart's Don Giovanni was notable. In August 1839 she sailed for North America, appearing in nine operas at New York's Park Theatre, including Adina in L'elisir d'amore, and winning audience hearts. Returning to Britain, she sang Adalgisa in Norma (Liverpool, 1841) and operatic roles at Covent Garden, as well as resuming her career as pantomime principal boy. The Sacred Harmonic Society engaged her for Messiah (Exeter Hall, 1843) alongside Elizabeth Rainforth, John Braham and Henry Phillips. Her career met with a setback when she broke a leg in a riding accident: the bone was set by the surgeon Samuel Bacon (c.1799-1856), who became her husband at St Pancras Church, on 10 July 1845. Soon after, she created the breeches role of Lazarillo in William Vincent Wallace's hugely successful opera Maritana (15 November 1845). Her varied concert and opera career blossomed during the late 1840s, and in 1851 she first played the title role in The Bohemian Girl; and when she played The Gypsy Queen in the same opera, at Sadler's Wells in May 1856, Balfe wrote her a new number, ‚ÄòLove smiles to deceive‚Äô. After nursing her husband through his final illness, she returned with a Hanover Square Rooms concert, after which the Daily News declared her ‚Äòone of the purest and most genuine singers that the English school has ever possessed‚Äô (3 April 1857). The following year she appeared as the Fool in King Lear. Retiring from the stage by the mid-1860s, Poole began a successful career as a teacher, though retaining her vocal powers and continuing to appear in concerts until 1881. She outlived her children Elizabeth (1850‚Äì1905) and Henry (1852‚Äì1877), dying in Langley, Buckinghamshire on 14 January 1906. Critical appraisal Grove described her mezzo-soprano voice as 'very mellow and sympathetic in quality', and added that 'in English songs and ballads she had no rival' (Grove's Dictionary).

Ledgard. Alternately a love story, a spy story, and an exploration of the ocean, Submergence was published in 2013 by Coffee House in America and in 2012 by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom. There are numerous translations including in Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, and Thai.  Plot summary  Submergence tells the story of an Australian-French professor of biomathematics at Imperial College, Danielle Flinders, and a British MI6 spy, James More. They meet and fall in love at a hotel on a wild stretch of the Atlantic coast of France. The novel alternates between the hotel and Danielle's scientific expedition to the sea floor and James's captivity in Somalia. \\"Running separately and together, their stories become dramatic explorations of conditions far larger than their individual destinies‚Äîa meditation on our species and our planet at a time heavily shadowed by the prospect of extinction,\\" said Philip Gourevitch in The New Yorker. Ledgard has said he wanted to show that \\"there is another world in our world - the 99% of the living space in our planet that is in the sea.\\"  Research  J.M. Ledgard spent time in al-Qaeda Shabab occupied areas of Somalia while researching the novel. On one trip, the Shabab were beheading enemies in the next town. Born in the Shetland Islands, Ledgard had a fascination with the ocean. He was a visiting fellow at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and studied chemosynthetic life in the deep sea.  Reception  Submergence was acclaimed as a significant novel of the decade. The Irish Times said it deserved to be one of the strongest contenders for the Booker Prize. (It was not shortlisted.) In America, it was a New York Times Book of the Year and a pick of the year by Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, NPR, Rainy Day, and others. Kathryn Schulz in New York said it was \\"the best novel I've read this year.\\" The sci-fi writer Jeff Van Der Meer said Submergence \\"contained more interesting ideas about science and philosophy than any science-fiction novel I've read in the past decade.\\" The book was adapted for Hollywood by Wim Wenders.

Mobilt bank-id (English: Mobile bank-id) was launched in October 2011, and is an electronic identification for modern smartphones from certain manufactures that is combined with a mobile application. It can be used as login or signing via the web on an ordinary PC, where the mobile work as a separate security device (\\"s√§kerhetsdosa\\"), and for login via bank and government mobile applications. The secret cryptographic key is stored in the mobile application (Bank-id s√§kerhetsapp), that works as a soft certificate. The e-service supplier (the business or government the user shall identify themselves towards) have a validation server. In 2014 about half of all smartphone users in Sweden used Mobile Bank-id. In five years the number of users almost doubled to 94 percent of all smartphone users. In 2019 all participating banks issued Mobile Bank-id, which does not apply to the other two solutions.

Painting from \\"The royal court ceremonies\\" (ÁöáÊúù Á¶Æ Âô® Âúñ Âºè) of the Qing dynasty. Vietnam arquebus refer to several type of gunpowder firearms produced historically in Vietnam. This page also include Vietnamese muskets - since the early definition of musket is \\"heavy arquebus\\".Arnold, 2001, The Renaissance at War, p. 75-78 The term Vietnam arquebus comes from Chinese word Jiao Chong (‰∫§ÈäÉ, lit. 'Jiaozhi Arquebus'), a generalization of firearms originating from Dai Viet.  History  Dai Viet used to have a relatively early tradition of using gunpowder weapon, perhaps imported from the Ming Dynasty. At the end of the 14th century, king Che Bong Nga of Champa died in battle when he was hit by hand cannon of the Tran army while he was surveying on the Hai Trieu River. Until the Ho dynasty, Ho Nguyen Trung manufactured Than Co Sang cannon. By the time of L√™ So, gunpowder weapons began to be widely used in the army. In Thailand, a gun was discovered that was originally believed to have originated in China, but based on the inscriptions on the gun they confirmed its Dai Viet origin. This is most likely a relic of the invasion of the Lanna kingdom (present day Chiang Mai) under Le Thanh Tong in 1479-1484. By the 16th century, when Europeans came to Dai Viet to trade, Western weapons were purchased by lords to equip their armies and muskets began to be imported into Dai Viet ever since. Tome Pires in his Suma Oriental (1515) mentioned that Cochin China has countless musketeers and small bombards. Pires also mentioned that very much gunpowder is used in war and for amusement. The Dai Viet muskets were not only widely used domestically, but also introduced into the Ming dynasty after the border conflicts between the Mac dynasty and ethnic minority groups in Guangxi and Yunnan. Two Vietnamese arquebuses with their dust cover. From Cornelis Tromp's weapon rack, dated 1650-1679 AD. Malay and Trinh Vietnamese soldiers used bamboo covers in their matchlock arquebus barrel and bound them with rattan, to keep them dry when marching in the rain. Vietnamese people also had a smaller piece of bamboo to put over the barrel, to prevent the gun from accumulating dust when it was placed on a weapon rack. The Vietnamese used such arquebus to harass a Spanish armada off shore in the late 16th century with some success.Charney (2004). p. 53. This gun is similar in form to an istinggar, but has longer buttstock. Two Vietnamese matchlock guns (first and second from above). The Jiaozhi arquebus is not only highly appreciated by the Chinese, but also praised especially by Western observers for its high accuracy in what they saw in the Le-Mac and Trinh-Nguyen wars. The Minh dynasty also rated Dai Viet arquebus as \\"the best gun in the world\\", even surpassing the Ottoman gun, the Japanese gun and the European gun. According to Dr. Ly Ba Trong, former head of the history department at Thanh Hoa University: > At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Annam people developed a matchlock gun > with excellent performance, which the Chinese called \\"Jiao Chong\\" (meaning > Jiaozhi gun). Some people think that this kind of gun is superior to the > Western and Japanese \\"Niao Chong\\" (È≥•ÈäÉ, 'Bird gun') and \\"Lu Mi Chong\\" (È≠ØÂØÜÈäÉ, > 'R√ªm arquebus') in terms of power and performance. Luu Hien Dinh, who lived at the end of the Ming dynasty and early Thanh's, commented: > \\"Jiaozhi matchlock is the best of the world\\" Dai Viet gun can penetrate several layers of iron armor, can kill from 2 to 5 people with one bullet but does not emit loud sound when fired. Qing-era record, ÂçóË∂äÁ≠ÜË®ò (N√°nyu√® b«êj√¨) likened the Vietnam arquebus with Java arquebus. In the late 17th century AD, Trinh army used long muskets, with the barrels alone being between 1.2 to 2 meters in length, resulting in heavier weight. They were carried on man's back and fired 124 g shot. To fire it requires a stand, from a piece of wood from 1.83-2.13 m long.Charney (2004). p. 54. A gun similar to gingal, with wooden stand and swivel is also reported:Charney (2004). p. 54-55. > \\"One end of the carriage is supported with 2 legs, or a fork of 3 foot high, > the other rests on the ground. The gun is placed on the top, where there is > an iron socket for the gun to rest in, and a swivel to turn the muzzle in > any way. From the breech of the gun there is a short stock for the man who > fires the gun to transverse it withal, and to rest it against his shoulder > ...\\" Even in the late 18th century, Nguyen musketeers relied on long matchlocks with swivels and three-legged stands.Charney (2004). p. 55.

Modern historians agree that Rajputs consisted of a mix of various different social groups including Shudras and tribals. Rajputization explains the process by which such diverse communities coalesced into the Rajput community. Formation According to modern scholars, almost all Rajputs clans originated from peasant or pastoral communities. Rajputization is the study of formation of the community over the centuries. Sociologists like Sarah Farris and Reinhard Bendix state that the original Kshatriyas in the northwest who existed until Mauryan times in tiny kingdoms were an extremely cultured, educated and intellectual group who were a challenge to monopoly of the Brahmins. According to Max Weber, ancient texts show they were not subordinate to the Brahmins in religious matters. These old Kshatriyas were undermined not only by the Brahmin priests of the time but were replaced by the rise of the new community of illiterate mercenaries in the north-west - the Rajputs. Since the Rajputs were generally illiterate unlike the Kshatriyas, their rise did not present a challenge to monopoly of the Brahmins. Anyone from the \\"village landlord\\" to the \\"newly wealthy lower caste Shudra\\" could employ Brahmins to retrospectively fabricate a genealogy and within a couple of generations they would gain acceptance as Hindu Rajputs. This process would get mirrored by communities in north India. Scholars refer to this as \\"Rajputization\\" and consider it similar to Sanskritization. This process of generation of the Rajput community resulted in hypergamy as well as female infanticide that was common in Hindu Rajput clans.German historian Hermann Kulke has coined the term \\"Secondary Rajputization\\" for describing the process of members of a tribe trying to re-associate themselves with their former tribal chiefs who had already transformed themselves into Rajputs via Rajputization and thus claim to be Rajputs themselves. Stewart N. Gordon states that during the era of the Mughal empire, \\"Hypergamous marriage\\" with the combination of service in the state army was another way a tribal family could convert to Rajput. This process required a change in tradition, dressing, ending window remarriage, etc. Such marriage of a tribal family with an acknowledged but possibly poor Rajput family would ultimately enable the non-Rajput family to become Rajput. This marriage pattern also supports the fact that Rajput was an \\"open caste category\\" available to those who served the Mughals. Scholars also give some examples of entire communities of Shudra origin \\"becoming\\" Rajput even as late as the 20th century. William Rowe, in his \\"The new Chauhans : A caste mobility movement in North India\\", discusses an example of a Shudra caste - the Noniyas - from Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar that had \\"become\\" Chauhan Rajputs over three generations in the Raj era. The more wealthy or advanced Noniyas started by forming the Sri Rajput Pacharni Sabha (Rajput Advancement Society) in 1898 and emulating the Rajput lifestyle. They also started wearing of Sacred thread. Rowe states that at a historic meeting of the caste in 1936, every child this Noniya group knew about their Rajput heritage. A caste of shepherds who were formerly Shudras successfully changed their status to Rajput in the Raj era and started wearing the Saced thread. They are now known as Sagar Rajputs. Researchers give examples of the Rajputs of both division of present day Uttarakhand - Garhwal and Kumaon and show how they were formally Shudra but had successfully converted to Rajput at different times. These Rajputs of Kumaon had successfully attained Rajput identity during the reign of Chand Rajas, which ended in 1790. Similarly, these Rajputs of Garhwal were shown by Berreman to have a ritually low status until as late as the 20th century. The terminology \\"Rajput\\" as of now doesn't represent a hereditary status but it is a term commonly applied to all those people who fought on the horseback and were associated with paid military service. The Rajputs of Rajasthan have often refused to acknowledge the warriors from the eastern part of the country as the Rajputs. These western Rajputs restricted their social contact with the people of variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, who claimed Rajput status by following intermarriages between themselves and preserving their \\"purity of blood\\".Hence many Rajputs of Rajasthan are nostalgic about their past and keenly conscious of their genealogy, emphasising a Rajput ethos that is martial in spirit, with a fierce pride in lineage and tradition.. Kolff thus describes the Rajputs of Bihar, Awadh and Varanasi with the terminology \\"Pseudo Rajput\\".These Pseudo Rajputs or the eastern Rajput often accompanied the Rajput of Rajasthan in their battles with the hordes of their supporters.They led the band of warriors called Purbiyas in order to assist their western counterparts but were notorious for frequently changing their allegiance as Silhadi did in the Battle against Babur, when he deserted Rana Sanga in the Battle of Khanwa leading to defeat of Rajput contingents and consolidation of Mughal empire in India. Bihari Rajputs who are also designated as Pseudo Rajputs by their western counterparts. Descent from the slaves Some medieval historian considered the term 'Rajput' to be used for the children born out of the female slaves or the concubines of the kings. Describing this theory of origin Ferishta outlines that, \\"those kings who did not satisfy with their married wives frequently had children with their concubines, these children though remained illegitimate as the heir to the throne, were styled as Rajputs\\". However, present Rajput community is made up from the amalgamation of some of the erstwhile unrecognised claimants to the Rajput status. The Ravana Rajputs are one such group within the Rajput caste who are believed to be the progeny of Rajput kings with their concubines and were most often called as Daroga.

With the help of DNA profiling, Baxter was arrested 13 years after the last murder while serving a sentence for car theft, convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment. Murders In the span of three years, one girl and two women were sexually assaulted and subsequently murdered in Westchester County. Initially, they were believed to be unrelated cases, as the victims were of different races, shared no commonalities and each was killed in a different town. Thanks to advancements in DNA technology, all three murders, which had become some of the county's oldest cold cases, were finally connected and solved. They were the following: * Michelle Walker (14) - on June 6, 1987, Walker, a black 9th-grade student, was sent by her family to buy pizza and a carton of milk at a store in Yonkers. While returning home, she walked along a popular trail, but didn't return home. The next day, her body was found in a wooded area of the trail, with her cash and jewelry missing. It was determined that she had been sexually assaulted, and died from asphyxiation, as her attacker had covered her nose and mouth. At the time, the then-18-year-old Baxter was living at an apartment in the neighborhood which overlooked the trail. Although the authorities wanted to question him, he was due in court for a separate case, and due to a law at the time, he couldn't be questioned in the murder. * Patricia England (19) - on New Year's Day that same year, England, a white resident of Yonkers, went out to visit a friend to celebrate her birthday. However, she vanished, and her frozen body was found two months later at Greenburgh, close to the Yonkers border. She had been sexually assaulted and likely killed via asphyxiation, with the crime scene occurring at a different place and the killer later transporting the body to the location. At first, Patricia's boyfriend was considered a suspect, but was ruled out via semen sample. The boyfriend had previously worked with Baxter at an autorepair shop in Yonkers, where they befriended each other. Through him, Patrick learned about Patricia. * Lisa Gibbens (25) - originally from Manhattan, Gibbens moved to Tuckahoe in the late 1980s in search of a quieter life. She had recently found a new job as a medical officer's receptionist at Hartsdale, and on July 17, 1990, she was en route to work when she was attacked near the Crestwood train station. Her attacker ripped through her clothing and sexually assaulted her, tossing her pantyhose aside. After finishing, he shot her once in the back of the head with a sawn-off shotgun, before stealing her purse and jewelry. She was later discovered by a bicyclist. The killing shocked the community, as murders were a rarity in Tuckahoe. At the time, her boyfriend and a carpenter named Douglas Steadman were considered suspects, but both were later eliminated. Baxter came across Gibbens by chance, as his only connection to the area was hanging out with some friends at the Crestwood Train Station. Exposure and imprisonment Since 1990, Patrick Baxter was jailed and released from prison on several occasion for different crimes. In the mid-1990s, he was convicted of auto theft in The Bronx and sentenced to 3-to-7 years imprisonment at the Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, with eligibility for parole in 2001. In early 2000, investigators examining cold cases noticed that Baxter's name kept popping up in relation to these cases, and they ordered that he give a blood sample for testing. After a legal battle, a sample was provided, which matched the killer's DNA in all three cases. Charges were soon filed, and Baxter was brought to trial in 2002. He was convicted of all three murders and sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment for each murder, to be served consecutively. During his sentencing, he expressed his condolences to the victims' families, but calmly denied committing the murders. External links * People v.

The consensus was split on religious grounds and some wanted a hall which ignored a woman's denomination whilst others like Lavinia Talbot supported a hall for Anglo Catholics. The first women's halls at the university, the denomination free Somerville Hall and Lady Margaret Hall, opened in 1879. A number of non- resident students also enrolled, a group which later developed into St Anne's College. Two further women's halls were St Hugh's Hall, founded by Elizabeth Wordsworth in 1886, and St Hilda's Hall, founded by Dorothea Beale in 1893. The AEW organised lectures and tutorials for female students at all the women's halls. In 1895 Henry Nettleship's widow Matilda donated his library to the AEW where it formed a shared collection for all women students, based in the attics of the Clarendon Building. It later became the library of the Society of Oxford Home-Students). In 1911 the University set up a Delegacy for Women Students and in 1920 women were allowed to become members of the university and the AEW was dissolved. The women honorary secretaries of the AEW were: Charlotte Byron Green (1880‚Äì1883), Bertha Johnson (1883‚Äì1894) and Annie Rogers (1894‚Äì1920).

A native of southern Sudan, he fought as rebel in the First Sudanese Civil War before migrating to Uganda. There he rose to head of the Malire Battalion and later the Paratroopers Military School. Regarded as one of the most talented soldiers in the Uganda Army during Amin's rule, Sule was tasked with leading the last major Ugandan counter-offensive during the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War of 1978‚Äì79. This operation culminated in the Battle of Lukaya of 10‚Äì11 March 1979, during which Sule was killed under unclear and disputed circumstances. His death resulted in the collapse of the Ugandan offensive, contributing to the eventual overthrow of Amin's regime.  Biography = Rebel activity and rise in the Uganda Army  Sule originated from southern Sudan. He was Christian as well as an ethnic Sudanese-Nubian and/or Kakwa. At some point, he joined the Anyanya rebels to fight against the Sudanese government in the First Sudanese Civil War. Sule eventually fled Sudan, and moved to Uganda, where he joined the Uganda Army, and rose in the ranks to lieutenant colonel. His case was not uncommon, as many Sudanese rebels opted to join the Uganda Army instead of laying down their weapons in Sudan. President Amin regarded the ex-Anyanya troops as loyal to his government and therefore useful, although they factually acted as mercenaries. Around 1974, Sule commanded the Uganda Army's Malire Battalion. In that year, he and Air Force quartermaster Zeddy Maruru were sent to Europe by President Amin to assess the state of Uganda's embassies and the living situation of Ugandan exchange students. While there, the two heard stories of how Prince Mutebi had fought off an assassin who had attacked another student. Upon returning to Uganda, the two recommended that Amin recruit the prince into the Uganda Army, as they were impressed by his bravery. In 1976 Sule served as commander of Entebbe Air Base. He was not present at the facility during Operation Entebbe‚Äîa nighttime Israeli attack which destroyed a significant portion of the Uganda Army Air Force‚Äîhaving left early to meet a female companion at Lake Victoria Hotel. Uganda Army Chief of Staff Mustafa Adrisi reportedly wanted to incarcerate or execute Sule for his lapse in responsibility, but his closeness to Amin guaranteed his safety. From at least 1977 to his eventual death in combat, he headed the Paratroopers Military School in Uganda's capital Kampala.  Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War  In late 1978, the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War broke out under unclear circumstances. After an initial Ugandan invasion of Tanzanian territory was defeated, the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) launched a counter-invasion and overran the border town of Mutukula on 21‚Äì22 January 1979. Although the garrison had been promised immediate reinforcements, these never arrived. Shortly after the battle, Sule and Brigadier Taban Lupayi arrived with a helicopter at nearby Sanje, to where the Mutukula garrison had retreated. They informed the local commander, Bernard Rwehururu, that the reinforcements had halted in Lukaya, to the north. This information was received badly by the local troops; Sule sensed that the soldiers could possibly revolt and instructed Lupayi to order the reinforcements to advance so that they could relieve Rwehururu's men. Regardless, the troops remained restitive. A warrant officer informed Lupayi that some angry infantrymen might be tempted to shoot the officers, causing Sule and Lupayi to quickly leave in their helicopter. In the next months, the Uganda Army was repeatedly defeated by the TPDF and allied Ugandan rebels. In an attempt to reverse the Tanzanian victories, Amin placed Sule in charge of a large-scale counter-offensive that included Ugandan units as well as allied Libyan and Palestine Liberation Organisation forces. At the time, Sule was regarded as one of the Uganda Army's most competent commanders. While most foreign-born soldiers in the Uganda Army proved to be unreliable and unmotivated during the conflict, Sule was genuinely interested in driving the TPDF from Uganda. He emphasized mobile assaults instead of the previous defensive tactics of the Uganda Army, and personally led the operation. The initial offensive of the Ugandan-Libyan-Palestinian force targeted Lukaya, overwhelming the Tanzanian defenders and retaking the town on 10 March 1979. On the next day, the Tanzanian-led forces launched a counter-attack, surprising the Ugandan-led troops and driving them back. Sule attempted to rally his troops, assuming command of several tanks and driving toward the frontline. He was subsequently killed amid the fighting. His death prompted the collapse of the Ugandan command structure, and the remaining Ugandan troops abandoned their positions and fled, allowing the Tanzanians to secure the town. The circumstances surrounding Sule's death remain unclear. Lieutenant Colonel Rwehururu overheard conflicting radio reports that Sule had either been killed by enemy fire or had been crushed by one of his tanks. When Rwehururu asked for clarification, he was told that he should focus on his own affairs, and the radio in Lukaya was subsequently turned off. When another Ugandan commander at Lukaya, Abdu Kisuule, could not determine Sule's whereabouts, he asked Amin to instruct soldiers to look for his corpse among the bodies brought back to Kampala. Amin later told him that Sule was found among them, his face crushed. Amin's son, Jaffar Rembo, claimed that Sule was shot from behind in a \\"so-called 'friendly fire'\\" incident. According to journalist Faustin Mugabe, other \\"insiders\\" have said that his death was \\"treacherous\\". Lieutenant Muzamir Amule dismissed their claims and supported the assertion that Sule was crushed by one of his tanks, and that this was not understood until the day after the battle. He stated that the commander had been directing tank fire at the Tanzanian positions when it was still dark, resulting in his accidental death when a tank reversed to circumnavigate a ditch. In contrast, researcher Richard J. Reid stated that Sule was \\"apparently killed by his own mutinous troops\\". Sule's death had a detrimental impact on the Uganda Army which disintegrated after the Battle of Lukaya. Amin was overthrown when Tanzanian-led forces captured Kampala in April 1979.

Shukto has numerous different variations and can be prepared in different ways.>  History  Shukto is said to have been influenced by Portuguese cuisine when parts of coastal Bengal were colonized by the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese settlers may have modified a similar dish by adding local ingredients like bitter gourd, and developed it into a mouth freshener, mixing it with other vegetables. Over time, the dish became a part of Bengali cuisine with some additional ingredients like milk, bori, mustard paste and oil. Pritha Sen, however, disagrees and states the origin to predate the 16th century Portuguese arrival in Bengal. According to Sen, the tradition of starting a meal by consuming bitters, considered to have a medicinal value, dates back to the ancient times and was promoted by the authors of Ayurveda. She also states that Shukto was consumed as a cooling agent in the hot and humid climates of the ancient kingdoms of undivided Bengal like Anga, Vanga and Kalinga. Shukto is also said to have mentions in Mangal-KƒÅvya, written during the medieval period and in the biographies of Sri Chaitanya.  Variations  Dudh Shukto is a popular variant which is prepared with milk to alleviate the bitter taste of the dish. Some variants are made with fishes of different sizes. Such variants of Shukto typically use turmeric which is usually absent in the vegetarian variants. Some of the variants even exclude the bitter vegetables and are prepared with fenugreek seeds instead, to preserve the bitterness.

Established in 1825, it saw burials until the 1840s, when Rose Hill Cemetery, a much larger cemetery in the city, opened. Following this, the cemetery fell into ruins, and following failed efforts in the late 1800s to convert the area to a public park, the cemetery was restored in the 1970s. The cemetery is located in the Macon Railroad Industrial District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The cemetery was established in 1825, just southeast of what is today downtown Macon, Georgia. Referred to as \\"God's Acre\\" by Maconites, individuals interred at the cemetery include a major from the American Revolutionary War and the daughter of Jared Irwin, a Governor of Georgia. By the 1830s, however, the city council of Macon feared that the City Cemetery would soon become inadequate for Macon's needs, and appointed a commission to establish Rose Hill Cemetery, likely the first rural cemetery in the Southern United States. This much larger cemetery opened in 1840 and quickly became the main burial place for the city. The last burial to take place at the Old City Cemetery occurred a few years later in 1843. Following this, the cemetery fell into ruins, with an 1891 article in The Telegraph describing it as ‚Äúa wilderness, a ruined necropolis, the habitation only of dogs and vermin; the wasteland in the slums of a city.‚Äù That same year, the Macon city council began to exhume the hundreds of bodies that were buried in the cemetery, with the intent of converting the cemetery to a public park called \\"Founder's Park\\" that would feature a monument describing the cemetery. However, these plans never came to fruition. In 1914, the fire department put out a fire at the cemetery, caused by sparks from a passing streetcar. Throughout the 20th century, local churches and organizations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution performed upkeep and repairs to the city-owned cemetery, which underwent a restoration in the 1970s.

Early years M√ºbeccel was born to Ottoman Army officer H√ºsamettin and his wife Berg√ºzar as the youngest of three daughters. Her older sisters were Melahat (later Etili) and Sabahat (later Filmer). After her father died during his duty at the Russian border, her mother moved to Istanbul with her daughters, and lived in an apartment with their paternal grandmother. Physical education and sport M√ºbeccel was educated at Teachers' School for Girls. During her free time, she took part in sports and learned the English language. She worked as a sports assistant at the British School of Istanbul. She was one of the first female athletes in Turkey. At the first athletics competition for women in Turkey held on 12 February 1926 at Ittihat Sports Field (today ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu Stadium of Fenerbah√ße S.K., in Kadƒ±k√∂y, Istanbul), she finished first among four other women in the 300 metres event. She set records and won championships in numerous competitions. Later, she became successful in cross country running, and was also active in tennis, mountaineering, and water sports. She stated once that she was also skilled in hockey. She was a licensed referee for athletics, and officiated at the Balkan Athletics Championships. In the early 1930s, she was sent to Sweden on a Tate scholarship for the study of physical education. After graduation, she returned home and served at Istanbul High School for Girls and a few other high schools as teacher of physical education. She believed in physical education and sports for women of the Republican Era. She published her opinions on this in dailies and periodicals. In an article published in Spor Postasƒ± in 1935 titled Kƒ±zlarimƒ±z ve Beden Terbiyesi (\\"Our Girls and Physical Education\\"), she emphasised that parents are responsible for neglecting their daughters' physical activities. She invited girls and their parents to gymnastics courses that she held free of charge at the community center Beyoƒülu Halkevi. In an article published in the daily Cumhuriyet, she criticized the 1939 \\"Law on the Obligation of Physical Education\\", which immunized women over a certain age from physical education. She wrote: \\"To love something, you have to know. To know something you have to learn. And, to learn something, you have to see and practice!\\" In 1941, she opened a modern sports hall. Radio presenter M√ºbeccel was tasked with consulting with the British Council representative during the official visit of classical ballet dancer Ninette de Valois to Turkey in April 1947. Only a few months later, she was tasked with interpreting during the official visit of the Governor of Istanbul, L√ºtfi Kƒ±rdar, to the British Council in London. In 1948, she went to London for the Games of the XIV Olympiad, where she was offered a post at the BBC Turkish Service thanks to her clear diction in Turkish, excellent command of the English language, and acceptability in society. She accepted the job offer and stayed in London. The only female staff member at the Turkish service at Bush House, she spoke French, Swedish, German, and English. The Turkish magazine 'Hayat praised her, saying \\"she is no less than a diplomat, who represents her country with success\\". She carried out the activities of the \\"Club of BBC Turkish Listeners\\", and launched a competition entitled \\"Listener of the Year\\", which awarded Turkish winners a trip to London. She co-founded the British-Turkish Friendship Association. She was nicknamed \\"Londra Kadƒ±sƒ±\\" (\\"The Kadi of London\\") due to her helpful manner to the Turkish community in London.

The main forest road (east-west direction) of Anticosti Island serves the upper part of this valley; it passes between the Lake of the Fourteenth Mile and Lake Simonne. The intermediate part of this valley is served by a forest road (direction es-west). Along the coast, the forest road connects to the east with the forest road network for forestry purposes. Forestry is the main economic activity in this area; recreational tourism activities, second.  Geography  La Petite Rivi√®re has its source at the Fourteenth Mile Lake (length: ; altitude: ) located in the western part of Anticosti Island. This toponym is based on the fact that it is located at the 14th mile east of the center of the village of Port-Menier. The mouth of this lake surrounded by marshes, is located at the bottom of the southwest bay, at: * northeast of the town center of the village of Port-Menier; * south of the north shore of Anticosti Island; * north of the south shore of Anticosti Island.

He was a professor of psychiatry at the University of Groningen, Utrecht University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Maastricht University. Van Praag is considered the founder of biological psychiatry in the Netherlands. After his retirement he has written extensively on religiosity. Life=Early life Van Praag was born on 17 October 1929 in Schiedam. Van Praag is Jewish. His grandparents on both sides were among the first Zionists in the Netherlands, while his parents were non-religious. During the German occupation of the Netherlands his father, an engineer and jurist for the government was fired. Van Praag himself was taken by the Ordnungspolizei from his primary school in 1942. Between 1942 and 1945 he imprisoned in camp Barneveld and later in Westerbork transit camp and Theresienstadt concentration camp. Together with his parents and sister he survived the war. He returned from Theresienstadt two months after the end of the war and immediately applied to attend the third year program of the Hogere Burgerschool, to which he was admitted even though he had missed three years of education. Career Upon completion of his secondary education he studied medicine at Leiden University. After his compulsory military service he performed his doctoral research at the Dijkzigt hospital, where he later became of the psychiatry department. In the late 1950s he studied neurology, with a minor in psychiatry. He was impressed by the introduction of monoamine oxidase inhibitor and continued his studies in psychiatry. He obtained his doctorate in medicine at Utrecht University in 1962 under professor with a thesis titled: \\"Een kritisch onderzoek naar de betekenis van monoamineoxydase- remming als therapeutisch principe bij de behandeling van depressies\\". Between 1968 and 1970 he was a lector of biological psychiatry at the University of Groningen. In the latter year he was named professor of psychiatry at the same university, with a teaching assignment in biological psychiatry. He was the first professor of biological psychiatry in the Netherlands. During his time in Groningen he was founder of an institute for biological psychiatric research, which was the first in Europe. He would remain a professor at Groningen until 1978. During the anti-psychiatry-movement of the 1970s van Praag faced criticism from students and others who were oppposed to biological psychiatry and psychiatric medication, which even lead to threats and police protection. Van Praag was professor of psychiatry at Utrecht University between 1978 and 1982. His move to Utrecht was criticized by students sympathetic with the anti-psychiatry movement and van Praag in turn dedicated his inaugural lecture to a critique of anti-psychiatry. In 1982 he moved to New York City where he became a professor of psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He worked there until 1992. During this period he re-organized psychiatric care in The Bronx. He was a professor of psychiatry at Maastricht University between 1993 and his retirement in 1997. Van Praag is considered the founder of biological psychiatry in the Netherlands. He is known for his criticism of diagostic systems within psychiatry and arguing for a more functional diagnosis. Van Praag has also worked on the search for biological markers for psychiatric syndromes. He was one of the earliest researchers into 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid of cerebrospinal fluid of depressed patients. Even after his official retirement, van Praag in 2011 once again criticized the way of diagnositics within psychiatry via the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and argued for modernization by way of a functional diagnosis. In 1965 van Praag received the Ramaer medal for psychiatry of the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Psychiatrie en Neurologie. Van Praag was made Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion in 1990. He was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993. In 2007 he was named an honorary member of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology. Personal life As of 2018 van Praag was married for over 60 years, the couple had four children. He is close friends with neurobiologist Dick Swaab although the two disagree fundamentally on the role of the brain versus the totality of the human being. Van Praag was not raised religiously, he considers himself a Liberal Jew. Since the end of World War II he has worn a Star of David on his wrist. After his retirement has written extensively on psychiatry and religion and religiosity, including several books. He has argued for more interest of psychatrists in religiosity.

He is known as a pioneer of zarzuela.  Life  Joaqu√≠n Esp√≠n y Guill√©n was born on 3 May 1812 in Velilla de Medinaceli, Soria to Joaqu√≠n Espin y Beltr√°n and Josefa Guill√©n e Igual. He spend his early years with his paternal grandparents in Cuzcurrita, La Rioja, and later with his parents. Esp√≠n studied music theory and organ with Jos√© Aramburu, organist of the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada, and later moved to Burgos where he continued his training with the organists Vicente Pueyo and Ciriaco Olave. In 1831 Esp√≠n went to Bordeaux, France, where for nine month he was trained by the pianist Hoffmann. After returning from France Esp√≠n passed the examination as organist in Santo Domingo de la Calzada, and in 1833 moved to Madrid to continue his studies entering the Royal Conservatory of Music and Declamation. While studying in Madrid Esp√≠n started giving singing and piano classes. On 29 January 1836, he married Josefa P√©rez Colbrand, a niece of Rossini¬¥s first wife, signer Isabella Colbran. The couple had four children: Joaqu√≠n who became a well-known conductor, Julia who became a prima donna and a muse of Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer, as well as less known Josefina and Ernestina.  Career  Between 1838 and 1842, Esp√≠n was a President of the Music Section of the Artistic Lyceum, and from 1841 to 1845 he was a teacher at the Matritense Museum. He also held a position of Vice President of the Music Section at the Spanish Institute for two years. On 2 January 1842, Esp√≠n founded the first Spanish musical newspaper La Iberia Musical. For five years until 1846, Esp√≠n was its director, owner and main contributor. In late 1845, Esp√≠n went to Bologna at Rossini¬¥s request to fix the testament of the Rossini¬¥s first wife Isabel Colbrand, and there Esp√≠n had an opportunity to meet Giuseppe Verdi. In October 1847, Esp√≠n founded an association C√≠rculo Filarm√≥nico that offered an alternative musical training to that of the Madrid Conservatory. Joaqu√≠n Esp√≠n y Guill√©n - Padilla - act 1, scene 5 In 1851, he was a choirmaster and director of the military bad of the Royal Theater. Esp√≠n was also a president of Matritense Philharmonic Academy. From 1851 to 1855, Esp√≠n collaborated with Ram√≥n Mesonero Romanos and Pedro Madrano writing articles on music for Modern Encyclopedia at the initiative of Francisco de Paula Mellado. In 1853, Esp√≠n raised an instance to Queen Isabella II to request a creation of a music section in the National Library, but the request was denied. Esp√≠n wrote his first zarzuela Carlos Broschi that was premiered in the San Fernando Theater in Seville on 12 February 1854 and was staged until 1856. His second zarzuela El encogido y el estirado was premiered at the Teatro del Circo on 14 March 1857. In the 1850s, Esp√≠n composed four zarzuelas, considering this new genre a great possible way to create the national opera. From May 1862 Esp√≠n served as organist in the Royal Chapel, and from 1865 to 1867 he was a choirmaster at the Royal Theater. After the reform of the Madrid Conservatory, he was appointed a professor by Royal Order on 20 June 1868. From January 1869 Esp√≠n was in charge of writing ‚ÄúRevistas musicales‚Äù for La Iberia, and until August 1872 collaborated with Diario Politico. For almost four years from August 1878 to February 1881, he collaborated with La Politica writing chronicles and music criticism. In February 1882 Esp√≠n returned to work as professor of solfeggio at the Madrid Conservatory. Joaqu√≠n Esp√≠n y Guill√©n died on 24 June 1882 in Madrid.

Released on the independent label Clappers, it is considered the first political hip hop song. Like the content of the song, the label Clappers Records was developed by Lister Hewan-Lowe who wanted to create a label to release politically motivated for music. While working for Island Records, he reached out to reggae musicians involved in the hip hop music world in New York City to find someone who wanted to record a political record. He met with Daryl Aamaa Nubyahn who had written lyrics for the song and agreed to meet with him at A&R; Studios to record it. On meeting at the studio, Nubyahn had invited several people to record the verses with him who were known as Collective Effort. Production=Background Clappers was a record label in New York City created by Lister Hewan-Lowe. Hewan-Howe was influenced by Gil Scott-Heron's involvement with the record label Strata-East Records. He stated that \\"I got revved up and excited about the possibilities of forming a record company that had a Maoist approach instead of a capitalist approach, I was obsessed with the fact that shareholders should be the people who made the music.\\" Kugelberg initially began making the label Ark Music Records, one of the first reggae record companies in the United States. Hewan- Howe later gave that label to his friend and classmate Augustus Pablo as a gift and started Clappers Records, a label whose name had three meanings: in Jamaican Patois, it means that if someone clapped your music, it meant somebody ripped it off, it meant that you took a gun and shot someone, and it also meant you just had sex. Development After proposing the idea of making a \\"revolutionary hip hop record\\", Hewan-Howe began approaching reggae people that were involved in rap music in New York and was looking for \\"the most militant political activists to record for Clappers Records\\". Daryl Aamaa Nubyahn, also known as Brother D, went to Island Records where Hewan-Howe was also working and introduced himself as saying that they will never record his records because \\"nobody wants to record it because it's too political, too militant\\" Hewan-Howe disagreed, offering him a copy of the album Rastaman Vibration which was released by Island. Nubyahn had written lyrics for a song and suggested a Philadelphia based record to be on the rhythm section which Hewan-Howe turned down. Hewan-Howe went to A&R; Studios to record the song and expected only Nubyahn to show up only to find what he described as \\"an army of people\\" arriving which Nubyahn introduced as the \\"Collective Effort\\". The record was the first to be both explicitly political in both its lyrical content and its methods of production and distribution. The lyrics of the song are performed by unnamed male and female rappers with lyrics encouraging listeners to consider the \\"good time music\\" and the actual reality of the situation is derived from. The music used on the record taken from Cheryl Lynn's song \\"Got to be Real\\". Release \\"How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?\\" was released in 1980 on Clappers Records.

Since its inception, the bike receives a lot of appreciation from the buyers because of its amazing body but due to the low power of the bike and lack of proper marketing, the Impulse failed. After the commercial failure of the Impulse, Hero MotoCorp decided to fill the void in the segment with the addition of a higher displacement ADV motorcycle named the XPulse 200. Unlike the Impulse, the new XPulse is an adventure tourer motorcycle. Hero first unveiled the motorcycle at the 2017 EICMA Show in Italy. The XPulse 200 carries forward the legacy of the Impulse, but it is more accessible and more purposeful. The motorcycle has been updated to comply with the newest, more stringent emission norms. Upon its introduction, the XPulse 200 was praised for its good suspension and off-road ability, while some criticism was directed to the relatively low power output of the engine. The motorcycle also has longer intervals between servicing and oil changes. Powering the XPulse 200 BS6 is a 199.6cc, single-cylinder engine that now features an oil-cooled setup instead of the air-cooled layout on the BS4 model. The updated motor produces 17.8bhp of power at 8,500rpm and 16.45Nm of torque at 6,500rpm. The engine is mated to a five-speed gearbox. Hero offers the XPulse 200 BS6 in a single variant with fuel-injection. The carburettor version has been discontinued.  Design = Engine  The Xpulse 200's engine was designed and produced by Hero from the ground-up and shares little to no parts with other contemporaries in the company's line-up.The motor generates a power output of 17.8 bhp at 8,500 rpm (13.3 KW) and a maximum torque of 16.45 Nm at 6,500 rpm. The engine also includes an oil cooler, a first among motorcycles manufactured by Hero, India.

He served as an economic botanist and as a director of agriculture in the United Provinces. Martin-Leake was born in Hadley, Middlesex to William and Louisa Harriet (born Tennant) Martin-Leake and was educated at Dulwich and Christ College, Cambridge. After receiving a degree, he worked under Marshall Ward on plant diseases in hops. He applied for a position of biologist in Bihar and found the position already taken. In 1901 he was asked if he was interested since the previous holder had died from cholera. He took up the position and went to Muzaffarpur. He married Lois Millicent Frieda, the daughter of a chemist colleague of his, W.P. Bloxham. His work on indigo involved the examination of different varieties and the genetic improvement of the crop. He also had to solve seed dormancy issues, which he achieved by having them fed to ducks or by mechanical abrasion. He collected varieties with the help of A.T. Gage (then at the Sibpur botanic gardens) going on tour across the region. His attempts however were cut short due to the decline in the indigo industry following the synthesis of aniline. The research station at Pemberanda was placed under Bernard Coventry and Lord Curzon approved the development of agricultural research at Pusa. Leake was offered a position in the Indian Agricultural Service in 1904 and served briefly as garden in-charge at Saharanpur. Here he trained two Indian assistants for cotton breeding and one of them, Ram Prasad Singh (later Rai Sahib Ram Prasad Singh) became a cotton breeder of repute. Leake also worked on opium production with demand for morphine rising during World War I. He worked along with H.E. Annett on crop diversity in Papaver somniferum and morphine yields. He examined a measure that he called \\"effective rainfall\\", a cumulative measure of rain, and its effect on yield through statistical correlation.

Moreland) While serving as director of agriculture in the United Provinces, Martin-Leake sought to improve the system of agriculture that involved zamindars or land owners merely renting out land to the farmers to one that involved more cooperation. He attempted to improve a course for zamindars at the Cawnpore agricultural college but this was a failure. He helped develop a rocking microtomeJournal of the Royal Microscopical Society 1901 and a seed- drill which he patented. During the First World War, he served as a captain in the 7th UP Horse IDF. Leake left India in 1923, and worked briefly in Sudan on cotton and also served as a principal at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad. He lived in 10, Queen Edith's Way, Cambridge around 1946 and served as an editor for the International Sugar Journal from 1932 to 1960. He lost vision in his later life and lived in Wardington with his wife and died in 1977.

Published between 2013 and 2016, it gained a following online for its dark and depressing storyline, becoming an Internet meme. The manga is informally known as \\"177013\\" after its identifier on the site nHentai. Plot Metamorphosis follows Saki Yoshida (), a high school student whose efforts to become popular leads to drug use and unhealthy relationships, gradually spiraling down into disownment, prostitution, drug addiction, and homelessness, eventually ending with her committing suicide by heroin overdose. History The manga was serialized in Japan by Wanimagazine by its Japanese title () and subtitled Emergence. It was published in English by Fakku under the title Metamorphosis, digitally on November 10, 2016 and physically on March 1, 2017. Reception Metamorphosis initially gained notoriety in the English-speaking blogosphere in 2016 and 2017, when several reviews and discussions of the manga appeared on imageboards and YouTube which universally described its storyline as extremely depressing and traumatizing, with some labeling the work as \\"cursed\\". Several online communities, particularly the subreddit /r/animemes, subsequently adopted the manga as a meme symbolizing misery and depression. Some manga artists has created derivative works based on Metamorphosis. Even the original author, Shindo L, published a short alternative \\"happy ending\\" featuring a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure crossover. Analysis Metamorphosis has been seen by some as inspired by Franz Kafka's novella of the same name, drawing comparisons to the dark themes and plots surrounding transformation. Shindo L writes in the manga's afterword that he intended Metamorphosis to portray the \\"charm\\" of a miserable female main character. He also said in an interview that projecting a work's themes and opinions onto its author is a \\"fallacy\\" and that he has \\"never met a person whose reality is directly influenced by what they read.\\" Publications * * References Category:Hentai anime and manga Category:Child sexual abuse in fiction Category:Prostitution in comics Category:Fictional drug addicts Category:Rape in fiction Category:Internet memes introduced in 2016 ","title":"Metamorphosis (manga)"},{"id":"64912598","text":"Princess Xenia was a Fokker F.VIIa aircraft, built in 1925 for the Dutch airline KLM and initially used for regular journeys between Amsterdam and London via Rotterdam. In 1927, it was bought by a wealthy American who was married to a Russian princess and named the aircraft Princess Xenia for her. He loaned the aircraft to aviator Robert Henry McIntosh, also known as 'All- Weather Mac', who in 1927, with two others, failed in an attempt to make the east-to-west transatlantic flight. Princess Xenia was subsequently commissioned to fly non-stop from London to India, but unsuccessfully. It was later sold to the consortium 'Air Communications Ltd' and given the name of The Spider by Mary Du Caurroy Russell, Duchess of Bedford, who on 2 August 1929, with Captain C. D. Barnard, departed on a record-breaking flight from Lympne Airport to Karachi, then in British India, and returned to Croydon Airport, England, in less than eight days. It subsequently broke the record for a flight from London to Cape Town and back. In 1934 the aircraft was sold to Sir Dossabhoy Hormusjee Bhiwandiwalla in Bombay, now Mumbai. It was broken up in 1937. Early flights Princess Xenia was a standard Fokker F.VIIa monoplane that was built in 1925 for the Dutch airline KLM. During its first two years it flew regularly between Amsterdam and London via Rotterdam. Transatlantic attempt On 2 February 1927, the aircraft was registered in Britain as G-EBTS. It had been bought by the son of millionaire William B. Leeds, also named William B. Leeds, who named the aircraft for his wife, the Russian Princess Xenia. Leeds subsequently loaned the aircraft to Captain Robert McIntosh (also known as All-Weather Mac), in whose name the aircraft was registered. Together with Irish Air Corps Commandant James Fitzmaurice, McIntosh made a failed attempt to cross the Atlantic from Baldonnel Aerodrome near Dublin on 16 September 1927. After five and a half hours of flight and 300 miles over the Atlantic, bad weather caused them to return. They landed with a crash at Beale strand, close to Ballybunion, County Kerry. At the time, the aircraft was brown/gold and blue, without cabin windows and marked with G-EBTS. It was fitted with a single Bristol Jupiter engine.

It is best suited to VHF and UHF frequencies, and takes only a short time to indicate a direction. This makes it suitable for measuring the location of the vast majority of commercial, amateur and automated broadcasts, and Doppler DF is one of the most widely used direction finding techniques. Other direction finding techniques are generally used only for fleeting signals, or longer or shorter wavelengths. As the name implies, the system uses the Doppler effect to determine whether a moving receiver antenna is approaching or receding from the source. Early systems used antennas mounted on spinning disks to create this motion. In modern systems, the antennas are not moving physically, but electrically, by rapidly switching between a set of several antennas. As long as the switching occurs rapidly enough, which is easy to arrange, the Doppler effect will be strong enough to determine the direction of the signal. This variation is known as pseudo-Doppler DF, or sometimes sequential phase DF. This newer technique is so widely used that it is often the Doppler DF seen in most references. Direction finding Early radio direction finding (RDF) solutions used highly directional antennas with sharp \\"nulls\\" in the reception pattern. The operator rotated the antenna looking for points where the signal either reached a maximum, or more commonly, suddenly disappeared or \\"nulled\\". A common RDF antenna design is the loop antenna, which is simply a loop of wire with a small gap in the circle, typically arranged to rotate around the vertical axis with the gap at the bottom. Some systems used dipole antennas instead of loops. Before the 1930s, radio signals were generally in what would today be known as the longwave spectrum. For the effective reception of these signals, very large antennas are needed. Direction finding with rotating antennas is difficult at these wavelengths due to the size of the antennas. A great advance in RDF technique was introduced in the form of the Bellini-Tosi direction finder system, which replaced the rotation of the antenna with the rotation of a small coil of wire connected to two non-moving antennas. The loop antennas were similar to those used in earlier systems but fixed in position, set at right angles to each other to form a cross-shaped arrangement. Each antenna will produce a different output whose relative strengths depend on how close the signal is to either antenna's null. These signals were sent to two coils of wire, the field coils, also arranged at right angles. These re-created the original signals in a much smaller space, about the size of a soda can. By rotating a small loop antenna, the sense coil, in the space between the two crossed field coils, one could perform DF. In effect, it recreated the traditional technique at a much smaller scale, allowing the main antennas to be built at any size. Robert Watson-Watt introduced the next major advance in direction finding as the \\"huff-duff\\" system, a nickname for high-frequency direction finding. Huff-duff also used crossed antennas, often an Adcock antenna, but sent their output to the two channels of an oscilloscope. The relative strengths and phases of the two signals deflected the X and Y locations of the oscilloscope's electron beam by different amounts, causing an ellipse or figure-8 to appear on the screen, with the long axis indicating the direction of the signal. The readout was essentially instantaneous and proved able to easily detect even short transmissions. Huff-duff was used in about one-quarter of all successful U-boat sinkings. Both of these systems have drawbacks. The Bellini-Tosi system still has moving parts, albeit small ones, but has the more major limitation that it requires the operator to hunt for the signal, which may take several minutes. Huff-duff provides a direct and immediate indication of the signal direction, but only at the cost of requiring an oscilloscope or similar display system with an equally fast response. Both require two closely matched receivers and amplifiers, and often a third for the \\"sense\\" antenna, if used. Doppler effect If one places an antenna on a moving platform like the roof of a truck, the movement of the truck will cause the Doppler effect to shift the frequency of the signal upward as it moves towards the signal, or downward as it moves away. When the truck is driving at right angles to the signal, or not moving at all, there will be no shift. If the truck is driven around a circular track, there will be times when it approaches the signal, moves away from it, or moves at right angles. This will produce a rising and falling frequency shift of the target signal, producing a frequency modulated (FM) signal known as the Doppler sine wave. The FM signal has the same frequency as the rotational speed of the vehicle. The magnitude of the shift is a function of the wavelength of the signal and the angular velocity of the antenna: : Where is the Doppler shift in frequency (Hz), is the radius of the circle, is the angular velocity in radians per second, is the target wavelength and is the speed of light in meters per second. Converting to more common units: :To convert Hz to radians per second, multiply by 6.28 (2 pi) :To convert MHz to Hz, multiply by 1 million :Eliminating the constants gives (6.28 √ó 1000000) / 300000000 = ~= 48 Such that: : Where is the frequency of rotation in Hz and is the target frequency in MHz. Consider the example truck hunting an FM radio station at 101.5 MHz while driving around a wide pad (50 m radius) at . The circumference of the pad is 2œÄ√ó50 or 314 m, and its velocity in m/s is 25,000 / 60 / 60 ~= 7 m/s, so the truck completes one circuit in 314 / 7 = 45 seconds. is therefore . Feeding that into the formula above, the frequency shift is: : This amount of frequency shift is too small to be accurately measured. To improve the detection odds, the product must be increased. For this reason, Doppler DF systems normally mount their antennas on a small disk that is spun at high speed using an electric motor. Performing the same calculation using an antenna mounted to a diameter disk spinning at 1000 Hz results in: : Which is easily detected. Nevertheless, such a rotation speed, 60,000 rpm, demands precision systems. Because the antennas have to move at very high speeds, this technique is only really useful for higher frequency signals where the antennas can be shorter and the higher Fc produces a larger divisor. Early examples of Doppler DF systems date to at least 1941, and they were used in the United Kingdom for hunting out German early warning radars, which operated at 250 MHz in the 1.25-meter band. By 1943, examples were available that worked in the UHF region, used to find the German W√ºrzburg radars operating at 560 MHz. A significant advantage of this technique is that it requires only a single receiver, amplifier, and the appropriate FM demodulator. In contrast, huff-duff and B-T systems require two closely matched receivers, one for each antenna pair, and often a third for a sense channel. Widespread civilian use of the technique did not start until the introduction of practical circuits for the quadrature detector and phase- locked loop, both introduced after the war, which greatly simplified the reception of FM signals. Its use roughly follows the spread of FM radio, which also used these techniques. Pseudo-Doppler To further simplify the system, it is possible to simulate the movement of the antenna with a small amount of additional electronics. This is the pseudo-Doppler direction finding technique. Consider a pair of omnidirectional antennas receiving a signal from a target transmitter. As the signal propagates past the receiver, the amplitude of the signal at the antennas rises and falls. At long distances from the transmitter, well into the \\"far field\\", the wavefronts can be considered to be parallel. If the two antennas are arranged perpendicular to the line to the target, the phase difference between them is zero, whereas if they are arranged parallel to the line, the phase difference will be a function of the distance between them and the wavelength of the signal. For this example, consider the two antennas to be located of the target wavelength apart and aligned parallel to it. If the two antennas were sampled instantaneously, the difference in phase between them would always be the same, 90 ¬∞. But if one instead switches the input from one antenna to the other, there will always be some inherent delay during which time the signal continues to move past the two antennas. In this case, if the original sample was taken when the peak of the wavefront was at the nearer antenna and the system then switches to the farther one, the phase will not be 90 ¬∞ but somewhat smaller, because the wavefront approached the second antenna during that time. Now consider a series of such antennas arranged around the circumference of a circle, and a switch that connects to the antennas in turn in a clockwise fashion. If the target signal is at the 12 o'clock position, then the phase shift will be increased when the switching is moving \\"forward\\" between the 7 and 11 o'clock positions and reduced when moving \\"away\\", between 1 and 5. When switching between antennas perpendicular to the line to the signal, 11 to 1 and 5 to 7, the shift will be a constant value. The signal from the antennas is sent into a single receiver, resulting in a series of pulses whose amplitude depends on the phase at the instant of sampling. That signal is then smoothed to produce a sine wave. That sine wave is modulated exactly as it would be in the case of a single moving antenna. In the case of the moving antenna, the frequency shifts because the antenna is moving through the wavefront as it passes, whereas in the pseudo-Doppler case this is accomplished by timing the samples to simulate movement of a single antenna. The direction to the target transmitter can then be determined in the same fashion as the moving-antenna case, by comparing the phase of this signal to a reference signal. In this case, the reference is the clock signal triggering the switch. Because it has no moving parts and can be built using simple electronics, the pseudo-Doppler technique is very popular. Whilst not quite as fast as to take a measurement the huff-duff system, in modern systems the measurement is so rapid that there is little practical difference between the two concepts. Pseudo-Doppler has a significant advantage that the antenna system is much simpler, using monopole antennas, and if the switching system is located on the antenna, only a single wire runs back to the receiver and thus only one receiver is required. Because this technique is so widely used it is often referred to simply as Doppler DF, the \\"pseudo\\" rarely being added. The main disadvantage of the technique is a requirement for more signal processing. Because the \\"movement\\" in pseudo-Doppler proceeds in steps, the resulting signal is not smooth as it is in the case of a moving antenna. This results in a signal with considerable numbers of sidebands that have to be filtered out. The switching system also introduces electronic noise, further confusing the output. Modern signal processing can easily reduce these effects to insignificance.

Career He was born in Tatsuno, Hy≈çgo, where there is a shrine to the legendary founder of sumo, Nomi no Sukune. He is a member of the generation born between April 1986 and April 1987 (Showa 61) known as the that also includes yokozuna Kisenosato, ≈çzeki G≈çeid≈ç and sekiwake My≈çgiry≈´. He did judo when he first joined school, but from the fourth year of elementary school he switched to sumo, and participated in national sumo competitions at elementary and junior high school. He had aspirations to go to high school, but was persuaded to join Kitanoumi stable, run by the former yokozuna Kitanoumi, upon graduation from junior high. He made his professional debut in March 2002, alongside future top division wrestlers such as Kisenosato and Katayama, and also his own stablemate . He reached the third highest makushita division in July 2005, but weighing barely more than he found it hard to make further progess. He had began wrestling using his own surname of Shimada, but adopted his present shikona in March 2008, formed from combination of his original stable name (Kitanoumi) and an old name for west Hy≈çgo Prefecture (Harima Province). He finally reached the j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time in January 2012 nearly a decade after his debut. He was the first sekitori from Tatsuno since Banry≈´yama who had been a stablemate of Kitanoumi and was then a coach at the affiliated Mihogaseki stable. He spent all of 2012 in j≈´ry≈ç but had only two winning records in that time and was demoted back to the makushita division in January 2013. After moving between j≈´ry≈ç and makushita a number of times he re-established himself in j≈´ry≈ç from the September 2014 tournament. In November 2015 after the death of his stablemaster Kitanoumi, who was also the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, the former maegashira Gany≈´ took over the running of the stable, which was re-named Yamahibiki stable. Following a record of nine wins against six losses at the rank of J≈´ry≈ç 4 in May 2016, Kitaharima made his top makuuchi division debut in the July 2016 tournament, the only wrestler in that tournament who was new to the top division. It had taken him 85 tournaments from his professional debut to reach the top division, which is the ninth slowest in sumo history. His promotion came 14 years after leaving junior high school. He told reporters that having been in sumo since he was 15, he was disappointed that his contemporaries who had instead gone to high school and university before entering the professional ranks had overtaken him. At he was lightest man in the top division and some lighter than the average for the division. Kitaharima's stablemaster stressed the importance of his predecessor Kitanoumi to Kitaharima's success, saying that Kitanoumi always called Kitaharima by his given name \\"Seiya,\\" because \\"my disciples are the same as my own children.\\" Kitaharima won his first bout in the top division, defeating Nishikigi. However he finished the tournament with a losing record of six wins against nine losses and was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç after just one tournament. Restricted by neck pain, he had two poor performances of 5‚Äì10 and 4‚Äì11 in the following two tournaments and fell back to makushita in January 2017. After his neck problem cleared up he returned to j≈´ry≈ç after a 5‚Äì2 record, but lasted only one tournament. After two consecutive winning records in makushita in May and July 2017 he returned to j≈´ry≈ç again in September 2017. Both he and were being promoted to j≈´ry≈ç for the seventh time in this tournament, the second highest ever at the time. However he lost seven of his first eight bouts, and with a 5‚Äì10 record at the end of the tournament was once again demoted. He remained in makushita for the next three years before finally getting his eighth promotion to j≈´ry≈ç after the July 2020 tournament at the age of 34. He secured this result by defeating Takagenji on the final day for a 5‚Äì2 record at Makushita 3. He had been out of j≈´ry≈ç for 17 tournaments. In the September 2020 tournament Kitaharima could manage only five wins against ten losses, losing his last four bouts. He is known for wanting to practice day or night, which led to his stablemaster warning against him over-training. Kitaharima has said he has no real hobbies and on his makuuchi promotion remarked that he was thinking only about sumo. Fighting style Kitagarima is a tsuki/oshi specialist, who prefers pushing and thrusting at his opponents rather than fighting on the mawashi or belt. His most common winning kimarite or technique is oshi dashi or a straightforward push out.

Announced by Peck as a bridge between Pony and the next full-length album, it received positive reviews from critics. Recording and release Initially scheduled for release on June 12, 2020, the extended play was put out by Columbia and Sub Pop the following August 14, to allow more public attention to the George Floyd protests. The release was preceded by a music video for \\"Legends Never Die\\", a duet starring fellow Canadian country pop vocalist Shania Twain, as well as by videos for singles \\"No Glory in the West\\" and \\"Summertime\\". Peck recorded the songs as a follow-up to his 2019 debut Pony and was inspired by the work of Neil Young and Crazy Horse. He arranged the duet with Twain after the two met at an awards show in 2020 and recorded the song immediately before quarantining due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the duo working on the song at Twain's ranch. In addition to the themes of a rough and hot American Southwest, Peck viewed this release as a bridge between Pony and his next full-length project, re- recording \\"Summertime\\" from Pony-era sessions for this EP. Peck and Twain recorded a live-to-tape performance of \\"Legends Never Die\\" for The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to promote the release. Critical reception . Aggregator Album of the Year summed up critical consensus as an 88 out of 100, based on seven reviews. The A. V. Club staff listed this as one of five noteworthy releases of the week, with writer Cameron Scheetz saying, \\"Orville Peck's vocal muscle really shines through, staking out a place of his own among the legends that inspired him\\". Leonie Cooper of NME gave the album four out of five stars for Peck's diversity as a performer, with the \\"razzle- dazzle\\" of \\"Legends Never Die\\" and more somber and pensive tracks. Allie Gregory's review in Exclaim! was even more effusive, writing that the album solidifies Peck's place as one of country's greats, scoring it a nine out of ten. Similarly, Ross Horton of The Line of Best Fit gave the album an eight out of 10 for pushing the boundaries of country music, writing that Peck is on a \\"one-man mission to take country out farther into the wilderness that its ever been\\". Pitchfork Media's Cat Zhang gave a more mixed review, awarding a 6.7 out of 10 and praising the playfulness and depth of Peck's lyrics but noting that his stage persona is too shallow. Daniel Bromfield of Spectrum Culture summed up his review with a 64% and noting that the Peck persona is too flimsy: \\"his music still preoccupies itself with cowboy bombast rather than the wit, personality and day-to-day poetry that defines the best country music... The man behind the Peck project is beginning to emerge, but he remains more interesting as a myth.\\" Sales chart performance Show Pony appeared on several Billboard charts in the United States, reaching 8 on Americana/Folk Albums, 20 Top Album Sales, 46 on Top Country Albums, and 50 on Top Rock Albums.

The lots are located just west of the Lodge Freeway and only a few blocks north of the Cass headquarters at 11850 Woodrow Wilson. They obtained architectural plans for a variety of tiny homes, which ranged in size from of floor space. Cass Community Social Services raised money from numerous sources for the project, with an estimated total budget of $1.5 million. Donors included Ford Jon Bon Jovi, General Motors, staffing agency Epitec, and the Birmingham First United Methodist Church. A model home was constructed in late 2016, and the first six homes in the development were completed by early 2017. Nineteen homes were completed by 2019. Additional larger homes for families are planned in the future. Usage The homes in the development are slated for low-income tenants making as little as $8000 per year, with the intent to both address housing needs and set low-income tenant on the path to home ownership. The homes are rent-to-own, with tenants taking ownership after a seven-year period. The rent is set at , and includes all utilities. Tenants applying for the program also agree to meet with a financial coach, attend financial literacy classes, and volunteer on neighborhood projects. When the first six homes were completed in 2017, 122 people applied for tenancy. Applicants were anonymously rated using a numerical scoring system, which factored in residential history, financial readiness, and personal references. The first tenants ranged in age from 24 to 74, and earn an average income of $988 a month.

Similar to past Llamasoft titles like Tempest 2000 and Polybius, the title incorporates influences from classic arcade games of the early 1980s, along with psychedelic visuals and electronic music to create a trance-like effect. It supports virtual reality using Steam VR. Gameplay The player controls a moose traveling on a forward-facing path with two planes of gameplay at the top and bottom of the screen. Players can move in any direction, but may only shoot forward, and can switch between the two planes of gameplay with a button press. Players can collect sheep, released by destroying a checkered ball, to gain temporary invulnerability and a bonus if they are successfully brought to the end of the stage. Enemies may drop power- ups in the form of pills that grant new abilities or perks. The game consists of 50 stages, with pre-defined waves of enemies that appear in a semi-random layout.

She attended Kenya High School, where she developed a passion for chemistry, and would spend her free time at the chemistry lab at the University of Nairobi where her best friend's father was the head of the Chemistry department. After graduating high school, she was selected for the inaugural medicine class at Moi University but chose to study chemistry instead. In 2002, Gitau, joined the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Programme as a Research Assistant in Pharmacology. The KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Programme-Kenya then sponsored her doctoral degree in cellular immunology at the Open University in the UK, in collaboration with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Gitau's doctoral research investigated neurological infections in children living in malaria-endemic areas, specifically, how changes in protein levels could be used to detect severe disease. Gitau compared the proteins in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of children with cerebral malarial to those in children with other encephalopathies.  Research and career  Gitau returned to Kenya in 2007 to work as a post-doctoral assistant in Kilifi. There, she investigated the cellular immune responses to the P. falciparum malaria. Gitau's research examines how cerebral malaria affects cells, specifically in children, and has led internationally competitive research on the subject. Samples were initially frozen and shipped to Kenya from the United Kindgom, but Gitau was concerned that this processing could affect her research, so she lobbied for the purchase of much-needed equipment in her lab. Gitau's research emphasised how severe malnutrition often overlapped with severe malaria and other childhood infections: children who were severely undernourished were more likely to die from preventable infections. In 2013, as a postdoctoral researcher at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTP), she received a \\"Stars in Global Health\\" seed grant worth $100,000 from the competitive Grand Challenges Canada, supported by the Canadian government. The grant supported her research to develop a simple blood test for severe malnutrition and common infections. Gitau served as the African Academy of Science's Programme manager for the Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in African (AESA). In this capacity, she set up the Grand Challenges Africa initiative, raising over $11 million dollars, and oversaw the implementation. The initiative, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, funds projects working to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals led by innovators from African countries. She stepped down from this role on 31 October 2017, but continues to support the initiative in an advisory capacity. Gitau is the Director of Research Capacity Strengthening at the African Population and Health Research Center, contributing to its signature programme: the Consortium for the Advancement of Research Training in Africa (CARTA). She serves on numerous advisory boards including the Independent Scientific Advisory Board (ISAB), the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme College of Medicine, the Investment Committee Grand Challenges Canada, and the Crick-Africa Network. Gitau also participates in a mentorship program in Kenya that aims to encourage more women to study science by pairing young girls with high school science students on science projects.  Awards  In 2015, Gitau was named as a fellow of the Next Einstein Forum, which aims 'to create the right environment for the next Einstein to emerge from Africa'. She is the ambassador for the development of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics in Africa. Gitau was also on the Quartz Africa Innovators 2016 List, which highlights innovators for their \\"groundbreaking work, thought-leading initiatives and creative approaches to problems.\\" References Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women immunologists Category:Immunologists Category:Kenyan scientists Category:Kenyan women scientists Category:21st- century scientists Category:Women medical researchers Category:People from Nairobi ","title":"Evelyn Gitau"},{"id":"64914415","text":"Francisco-Jes√∫s √Ålvarez Curiel is a Spanish philologist and antiquarian perhaps best known for his work on popular Andalusian vocabulary.

Even the Ismailis themselves were not unified; e.g. the Ismailis in Isfahan did not recognize the authority of Hassan-i Sabbah in Alamut. Sometimes the actual anti- Ismailism came from the local Sunni population rather than the Seljuk government, such as the massacre of the Ismailis in Isfahan in 1101. In the Seljuk dynastic conflicts, all sides were relying on Ismaili soldiers, and some Seljuk elites are known to be Ismaili converts (e.g. Iranshah ibn Turanshah) or at least to have Nizari sympathies at times (e.g. Barkiyaruq and Ridwan ibn Tutush). Nizari Ismailis Hassan-i Sabbah Unlike the Fatimids who mostly produced learned scholars, the Nizaris of Alamut were mostly preoccupied with survival in their extremely hostile environment, and naturally produced, or acquired the alliance of, good military leaders. Many of these commanders are both military leaders and religious preachers (da'i) at the same time. * Abd al-Malik ibn Attash, Fatimid Chief Da'i of Persia and Iraq (1070s) **Hassan-i Sabbah, Da'i of Daylam **Tahir, local leader in Sawa * Hassan-i Sabbah, hujja, Lord of Alamut (1090‚Äì1124) **Dihdar Abu Ali Ardestani, da'i in Qazwin **Husayn Qa'ini, da'i, muhtasham (Governor) of Quhistan **Kiya Muzaffar?, muhtasham of Quhistan **al-Hakim al-Munajjim, Chief Da'i of Syria **Abu Tahir al-Sa'igh, Chief Da'i of Syria ***Abu al-Fath of Sarmin, da'i in Syria ***Husam al-Din ibn Dumlaj, commander of the Nizari armed forces in Aleppo ***Ibrahim al-Ajami, commandant of the Qal'at al-Balis ***Isma'il, da'i ***Unnamed brother of al-Hakim al-Munajjim **Bahram al-Da'i, Chief Da'i of Syria **Mu'ayyad al-Din Muzaffar ibn Ahmad Mustawfi, former Seljuk ra'is, commandant of GerdkuhSucceeded as Girdkuh's commandant by his son Sharaf al- Din Muhammad () after \\"a long time\\". **Abu Hamza, da'i in Arrajan **Kiya Buzurg-Ummid, commander, commandant of Lambsar Castle **Kiya Abu Ja'far, commander **Kiya Abu Ali, commander **Kiya Garshasb, commander **Hasan Adam Qasrani **Kayqubad Daylami, commandant of Tikrit Citadel * Ahmad ibn Abd al- Malik ibn Attash, da'i * Kiya Buzurg-Ummid, hujja, Lord of Alamut (1124‚Äì1138) **Dihdar Abu Ali Ardestani, member of the ruling council **Hasan Adam Qasrani, member of the ruling council **Kiya Abu Ja'far, member of the ruling council **Isma'il al-Ajami, Chief Da'i of Syria **Salarjuy(?), defected Seljuk amir **Kiya Nushad(?), commander **Khwaja Muhammad Nasihi Shahrastani * Kiya Muhammad ibn Buzurg-Ummid, hujja, Lord of Alamut (1138‚Äì1162) **Kiya Muhammad ibn Ali Khusraw Firuz, commander **Kiya Ali ibn Buzurg-Ummid, commander **Dihkhuda Abu Yusuf, commander **Kiya Husayn ibn Abd al-Jabbar **Amir Balqasim Shamshirzan, commander in Lambsar **Amir Malikshah, commander **Kiya Isma'il, commander **Ali ibn Wafa', commander in Syria **Shaykh Abu Muhammad, Chief Da'i of Syria Coin of Hassan II of Alamut * Hassan II 'Ala Dhikrihi's-Salam, Imam, Lord of Alamut (1162‚Äì1166) **Rashid al-Din Sinan, Chief Da'i of Syria * Nur al-Din Muhammad II, Imam, Lord of Alamut (1166‚Äì1210) Allies and sympathizers * Barkiyaruq (occasionally), sultan ** Majd al- Mulk al-Balasani, vizier of Barkiyaruq ** Amirdad Habashi, amir of Barkiyaruq, commander of Tabaristan and Jurjan Osman Aziz Basan, p.184 *** Mu'ayyad al-Din Muzaffar ibn Ahmad Mustawfi, Seljuk ra'is * Sa'd al-Mulk, vizier of Muhammad Tapar Osman Aziz Basan, p.196 * Abu al-Qasim Dargazini, vizier of Mahmud II * Iranshah ibn Turanshah, sultan of the Seljuks of Kirman * Sanjar, ruler of Khurasan (1097‚Äì1118), sultan of the Great Seljuk Empire (1118‚Äì1153) * Fakhr al-Mulk Ridwan ibn Tutush, sultan of Aleppo * Shams al-Mulk Alp Arslan al- Akhras (until 1113), sultan of Aleppo *Ilghazi, amir, Artuqid prince of Mardin and Mayyafariqin *Toghtekin, atabeg of Damascus **Abu Ali Tahir ibn Sa'd al- Mazadaqani, vizier *Shahrnush ibn Hazarasf ibn Namawar, Bawandid ruler *Hazarasf ibn Shahrnush (d. 1190), Paduspanid ruler * Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch * Al-Amid ibn Mansur (Mas'ud?), governor of Turaythith *Many others*The Nizaris often infiltrated into the Seljuk military; Nizari enemies= Great Seljuk Empire Assassination of Nizam al-Mulk * Malikshah I, sultan of the Great Seljuk Empire (1072‚Äì1092) **Nizam al-Mulk, vizier, atabeg of Malikshah I, de facto ruler (1072‚Äì1092) ** Abu Muslim, prefect of Rayy ** Yurun-Tash,.

Samarakoon, was a Sri Lankan dramatist, playwright, translator and author. One of the earliest pillars of Sri Lankan drama, he is well known for several stage plays directed and produced in 1970s including Kelani Palama and Ahasin Wetunu Minissu. Personal life Samarakoon was born on 14 August 1939 in Dekinda village, Nawalapitiya. He started primary education from St Andrew's Girls College, Nawalapitiya and secondary education from Kingswood College, Kandy. He worked as a teacher of Kingswood for a brief period. Later he moved to Colombo for clerk post of co- operative wholesale corporation Sathosa. Later he worked as a translator and also held the post of Institutional Manager. In 1982, he was transferred to Jaffna for a political revenge. Instead, he quit his job and returned home. In 1995 he got back to work. Samarakoon was married to popular artist Ramya Wanigasekara where the wedding was celebrated in 1987. She was born on 17 July in Kotiyakumbura, Kegalle as the fifth child in a family with seven siblings. Her father from Hettimulla, Kegalle was an estate superintendent and mother was from Eheliyagoda. Ramya has two elder sisters, two elder brothers and two younger brothers. She started primary education from Ampe Maha Vidyalaya, Kotiyakumbura. After attending to many school, she completed education finally from Ruwanwella Royal College. The affair started during the stage play Kelani Palama. The couple has one daughter, Buddhika Mudithani. Buddhika acted in Kelani Palama in little age as \\"Surangani\\". She excelled at stage costume designing. Samarakoon died on 01 August 2010 at the age of 71 following a brief illness. His remains were kept at his residence, No 45, Dibbadda Road, Thalpitiya, Wadduwa North. The funeral was held at the Wadduwa cemetery on August 2010. Career During school times, Samarakoon played a female role in the school play Vidura. However, he quit from acting since then and started to script writing. He wrote a detective story while in the school, which was later published as a novel Wes Muhunu. Samarakoon enters drama as a pioneer in bringing together Sathosa artists and creating Sathosa art in 1967. His first play was produced in 1968 under the direction of Sathosa Drama Circle. In 1965, Samarakoon made his maiden stage play Ledak Nethi Ledek. Samarakoon's second play is Charitha Dekak which came on stage under the direction of Sathosa Drama Circle in 1967. The play is considered to be a psychoanalytic work on gender relations. In 1971, he produced the play Ahasin Wetunu Minissu, where he won nine State awards including four major state awards: Best Script, Best Production, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress.. He went England, France, USA and many other countries to stage the drama as well. His award winning novel Ge Kurullo won the award for the best work of fiction in 1971. The book was also translated into Russian and Tamil languages. Samarakoon returned to drama in 1975 with the play Idama which won the Best Independent Essay and Best Actress awards at the State Drama Festival and four Merit Certificates for Outstanding Performance. In the same year, he won the award for the best original script at the State Drama Festival. On 25 October 1978, he produced the popular stage play Kelani Palama. Earlier he selected actress Chandra Kaluarachchi for the main role \\"Matilda\\". However she was pregnant at that time, where Samarakoon shifted to popular radio artist and his future wife Ramya Wanigasekara for the role. Still after his death, Wanigasekara produced the play and acted in the role for 41 consecutive years. The play is considered as a milestone in history of Sri Lankan theater. Samarakoon produced the stage plays Idama (1975), Jailer Unnahe (1986), Doowili (1990) and Raja Kathawa (1991), where Wanigasekara acted in all of them. Doowili is a drama that has gained rapid popularity due to its production on the subject of the world of a superpower in Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo. He also produced the plays Charitha Dekak (1967), Minihek (1979), Kaputu Bo (2003) and Kakul Hathare Ilandariya (2008). The play Kaputu Bo was a new production that changed the title and cast of his second play, Charitha Dekak, but not a new drama. Even though worked as a translator, Samarakoon was a freelance writer. Later he wrote many books such as Ek Sabhya Kathavak, Akalanka, Asammatha Adarayak, Ran Tharuwa, Thala Mala, Chandra Thapaya, Sundara Saha Sobani, Heta Kaluwara Dawasak, Sanda Eliya Kaluwarai and Loku Akka. In 1994, he wrote the novel Eka Kuse Upan Evun which is considered as one of his best publications. His only poem collection was Rathriya Awadi Nowe released in 2002.

History The area now occupied by the street lay just inside the city walls of Roman Eboracum, and it roughly follows the line of the Intervallum street. In 1972, excavations on the street found part of the city's sewers, providing draining from the bathhouses. The street was recorded under the name Girdlergate from the 14th-century,Anglia, vol.50, p.367 when it was known as a location for the manufacture of girdles. At that time, it was shorter, running only from Swinegate to Petergate. At the south-western end of the street lay the church of St Sampson, Girdlergate. In 1835, the street was rebuilt. It was extended south-west, to reach the new St Sampson's Square, and was renamed \\"Church Street\\". The street was also widened and, other than the church, all the buildings along its length were demolished and replaced over the next couple of years. All are of brick, and it is believed that some were designed by Pickersgill and Oates. The street now forms part of the city's central shopping area. Layout and architecture View south-west on Church Street The street now runs north-east, from St Sampson's Square, where it meets Silver Street; to King's Square, where it meets Low Petergate and Goodramgate. Halfway along, Patrick Pool runs to the south, and Swinegate to the north. Most of the buildings on the street date from the 1830s and are now listed buildings. On the north-west side, the listed buildings are 1A, 1, 2, 7, 10 and 11. The Golden Lion pub first received a licence in 1711, but it was rebuilt in the 1830s, and again in 1970. On the south-east side, 12 and 12A, 13, 14 and 14A, and 15-18 are all listed buildings, in addition to St Sampson's Church.

It featured eight teams in two groups, and had a final. The competition was won by Southern Vipers, who beat Northern Diamonds in the final. The tournament was named after former England captain Rachael Heyhoe Flint, Baroness Heyhoe- Flint, who died in 2017. Background and format The Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy was a 50-over cricket tournament created in 2020 so that English women's cricket could be played in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. The competition is expected to be a one-off event for 2020, with a new women's 50-over competition launched for 2021. All matches took place behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The England and Wales Cricket Board made some matches available to watch online, and the final was shown live on Sky Sports. The competition was named after former England captain Rachael Heyhoe Flint, Baroness Heyhoe-Flint, who died in 2017. The competition featured eight teams, who represented regional hubs, which were formed during an overhaul of the English women's domestic cricket structure. The teams were separated into a North and South Group, and each team played six group stage matches, in a double round-robin format. The two group winners played each other in the competition's final. The competition began on 29 August, and ended with the final on 27 September. Originally the final was scheduled for 26 September at the ground of the team with the most points, but the fixture was moved back to 27 September to avoid a clash with an England women's T20 match against the West Indies. Edgbaston was chosen as the venue for the final. Teams The teams were as follows: ;North Group * Central Sparks (representing Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire) * Lightning (representing Loughborough University, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire) * Northern Diamonds (representing Yorkshire, Durham and Northumberland) * Thunder (representing Lancashire, Cheshire and Cumbria) ;South Group * South East Stars (representing Surrey and Kent) * Southern Vipers (representing Hampshire, Sussex, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight and Oxfordshire) * Sunrisers (representing Middlesex, Essex, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk) * Western Storm (representing Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Cornwall, Devon, Wiltshire and Cricket Wales) Squads Each team had a squad of 15 players, and players on England central contracts were available for the competition. All players were paid for participating in the competitions, excluding those already on central contracts. After the squad announcements, England centrally contracted players were added to their teams. England players on a regional retainer contract were assigned to their regional team, and centrally contracted players were assigned appropriately. England players in the squad for the West Indies series were only available for the first two rounds of fixtures. Southern Vipers were the first team to announce their squad. Their regionally contracted players were Lauren Bell, Georgia Adams, Tara Norris, and Paige Schofield.

It features stories and interviews with the developers and creators of early video games. The series first premiered on August 19, 2020. Episodes High Score features interviews and segments around the creation and development of video games in the 1980s and 1990s. These are intermixed with animated segments rendered in a pixel art-style similar to video games of this period. The show's intro sequence is also animated in the pixel style and includes numerous references to past video games, with its theme song by the Australian band Power Glove. The series is narrated by Charles Martinet, who is the voice actor for Mario. Production Creator France Costrel said that she was inspired to create the documentary as, growing up in France but having American friends, \\"[video games] are a universal language\\". She had worked as the showrunner for \\"8-Bit Legacy\\", a video game documentary for Great Big Story, but recognized it only covered a portion of the history of the industry. She developed a pitch for Netflix, getting help from her colleagues from the show Dark Net and Melissa Wood. Costrel had wanted to shift focus away from the games themselves as most video game documentaries, and instead to the developers behind the games and players to give insights into the creativity on video game development. Costrel decided not to try to tell a full history of video games but limit it to overarching and cohesive stories of certain periods in the industry. Costrel and Wood said it made sense to start at the onset of arcade and console games to bookend one side of their story, and opted to end with the transition into 3D computer graphics as it \\"make a natural ending, a new kind of stepping stone in the history of gaming\\". In researching their stories, Costrel said that most of the video game companies were open to working with them to showcase the case, while some of the creators had left the industry and were also ready to share their stories. While Costrel estimated they had material for about twenty hours of content they had to whittle this to the six episodes and focused more on those stories that would be of interest across all types of game players, not just hardcore gamers. One of the games featured in the series was GayBlade by Ryan Best who had created it in the 1990s. As explained in the show, while moving from Hawaii to California, all his own copies of the game were lost, and could not find any other copies elsewhere, which he had explained to the producers during production. The producers had researched online for the game to find any copies to use for the show; near the end of post-production, they had been contacted by the in Berlin, who was able to supply them with a copy of the game who then returned the copy to Best. The game was added to the Internet Archive and playable there via emulation after its discovery. Costrel serves as director along with William Acks, Sam LaCroix, and Melissa Wood; all four along with Courtney Coupe also are the show's executive producers. Reception The series was well received by journalists as a well-put- together overview of the early video game period. GameSpot called the series \\"a crash course on the golden age of gaming filled with insightful interviews, brilliant writing, and most importantly, an inspiring and inclusive message.\\" Slash Film called the series \\"one of the most sleek and satisfying historical accounts of the early decades of video games, even if it‚Äôs not a definitive, comprehensive account of the ups and downs of the industry as a whole.\\" The Hollywood Reporter said \\"It's far from Netflix's best or most substantive doc ‚Äî it's often rather superficial and full of gaping holes ‚Äî but in terms of sheer bingeing ease, with six episodes, none running over 47 minutes, High Score is tough to top. It's light and fun and full of entertaining trivia, with a willingness to go just far enough off the beaten path that some of it will even be new for its core demo.\\" Ars Technica compared the series favorably in light of its own series of \\"War Stories\\" documentaries as a solid look at this era of video games, but noted that High Score has some notable omissions, such as Tetris. The A.V. Club was more critical of the disjointed narrative provided by the series, though praised the use of interviews with minor figures from the industry's history, saying \\"These personal and often unexpected stories are easily the highlight of High Score, and they‚Äôre occasionally the only thing that saves it from turning into the public school version of a video game history lesson.\\" Slate criticized the series for sidelining some equally important developments such as the Wizardry series alongside Ultima, and for not bringing up modern parallels, such as crunch time in the video gaming industry. The Verge praised the series for presenting underrepresented figures within video games like Heineman, Lawson, and Best but argued that the show presented them as those doing \\"boundary-pushing work\\", and failed to show the more realistic conditions of the video game industry of that timeframe and which remained a problem in current state of the video game industry.

It is based in Voevodina Street on the banks of the Iset River in the city of Yekaterinburg (known as Sverdlovsk between 1924 and 1991 and the fourth largest city in Russia). At the heart of the museum building is one of the oldest buildings in Yekaterinburg, a hospital built in 1730 for the Yekaterinburg Ironworks. The building was modified several times during the 19th century. In the 1970s, most of the buildings of the former ironworks were demolished and the Historical Square laid out in their place. At the end of the 1970s, the idea of converting the remainder into a museum space was suggested. The project was completed in 1986. History The art gallery, then known as the Sverdlovsk Art Gallery, was originally established in a second building in Weiner Street in 1936. Here collections of works of the Russian artistic avant-garde of the 1910-1920s, Russian art of the 1920-1950s, and the later period - the 1960s to the present day, were exhibited. During the Second World War the collection of the Hermitage Museum were transferred there for safety. In the mid-1980s much of the art collection was rehoused in the newly rebuilt Voevodina Street building. It was granted the status of a Museum of Fine Arts in 1988 and renamed the Yekaterinburg Museum of Fine Arts in 1992 after the city of Sverdlovsk was itself renamed.

In 1920, she became the first woman from Louisiana to serve as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. In 1946, she received the Loving Cup award from the The Times-Picayune newspaper in honor of a lifetime of civic activism. The Loving Cup is prestigious local community service award that \\"recognizes residents who have worked unselfishly for the community without expectation of public acclaim or material reward.\\" In her acceptance speech, she said: \\"I have always thought that citizenship was a privilege that carried with it responsibilities, primarily, as our spiritual leaders tell us, that ‚Äòwe are our brothers‚Äô keepers.‚Äô And therefore we should promote in every way possible the progress and prestige of the community in which we live.\\"  Personal life  Ida Weis was the third of seven children born to Caroline Mayer Weis and Julius Weis, one of the early Jewish families established in the American South. In 1845, Julius Weis had immigrated from Bavaria, Germany, to Natchez, Mississippi. He began working as an itinerant peddler, then opened dry-goods stores and ultimately became a successful cotton broker in New Orleans. In 1882, the family moved to Europe for 18 months for educational purposes. Ida Weis studied at Fr√§ulein Singer‚Äôs school in Frankfurt and at Madame Yeatman‚Äôs school for young ladies in Neuilly, France, becoming fluent in both German and French. Ida Weis began her activism at the age of 15, raising money for Touro Infirmary, a Jewish hospital in New Orleans. In 1890, she married Joseph Friend, a Yale graduate; they had four children. Their son Julius Weis Friend was an editor of the The Double-Dealer, a short-lived but influential New Orleans literary magazine (1921-1925) that published many up-and-coming modernist writers. Among its contributors were novelist Sherwood Anderson, poet Amy Lowell, avant-garde feminist novelist Djuna Barnes as well as, early in their careers, novelists Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner. The Double Dealer had an unusual number of women contributors and also published African American writers, including poet Jean Toomer. In 1924, Ida Weis Friend's son Henry \\"Bunny\\" Friend died at age 18. In his memory, she donated funds to create the Bunny Friend Playground in the 9th Ward of New Orleans. In 2015, the playground was the site of a mass shooting incident in which 17 people were injured. Ida Weis Friend is described in her elder years in the memoir My New Orleans, Gone Away, by Peter M. Wolf. The book cites her efforts to collect money, food and books for Jewish refugees during World War II; in 1946, the American Red Cross honored her efforts with a national award. Her brother Samuel Washington Weis, a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy (1888) and MIT (1892), was a sketch artist and entrepreneur. In 1906, he became president of Ilg Electric Ventilating Company, a producer of military and industrial fans in Chicago.http://afcaforum.com/forum1/53846-1.html Antique Fan Collectors Association Forum  Career  From 1919 to 1921, Ida Weis Friend advocated for a government-supported network of ethical businesses, including a woman- owned cooperative grocery store, working through the New Orleans Housewives League and city government. Leading up to 1920, she campaigned to get the 19th Amendment ratified in Louisiana, seeking to give women the right to vote. Despite the efforts of suffragists, Louisiana voted no. Friend was active in the Era Club of New Orleans, a suffrage and service organization whose name was an acronym: Equal Rights for All. In 1921, she was one of two women delegates to Louisiana's constitutional convention. The resulting 1921 Constitution of Louisiana gave the state the power to regulate working conditions and minimum wages for women and girls. Friend later campaigned to get the state's minimum employment age raised from 14 to 16.https://www.crescentcityjewishnews.com/women-of-valor-new-orleans-ladies/ She was founder of the New Orleans Hadassah, serving as its first president, from 1917 to 1920. She also led the local chapter of the service organization B'nai B'rith; the chapter was later named after her. Moving on to a position of national scope, she served as president of the National Council of Jewish Women from 1926 to 1932. Friend was also active in civil rights, serving in 1932 as a member of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation. In 1938, she helped found the New Orleans chapter of the Urban League, an organization dedicated to civil rights and economic empowerment. In the 1940s, she was a leader in the \\"Broom Brigade,\\" a group of women wielding brooms to symbolize their desire to clean up New Orleans City Hall. In 1946, the Brigade helped elect a reform candidate for mayor, \\"Chep\\" Morrison (deLesseps Story Morrison). The women's efforts gave them access to Morrison to advocate for their progressive agenda. (The name referred to Broom brigades of the 19th century, when women performed military-style exercises using brooms instead of rifles.) At her death in 1963 at age 95, Friend was still active, serving as president of the board of directors of the New Orleans Home for the Incurables (now the John J. Hainkel, Jr. Home and Rehabilitation Center), a nursing facility founded by a group of New Orleans women in 1891.

History The street was first mentioned in the 1380s, when it was known as Aldeconyngstrete (Old Coney Street). However, by 1641, it had become known as \\"Lendal\\", a contraction of \\"St Leonard's Hill\\". This \\"hill\\" was the quay on the River Ouse belonging to St Leonard's Hospital, which lay at the north-western end of the street. Most of the south-western side of the street was occupied by the Augustinian Friary, which was dissolved in 1538. St Wilfrid's Church lay on the north-east side until it was demolished later in the 16th-century. In about 1710, the city's main post office was built on the south-west side, while the large Judges' Lodgings house was built on the north-east side by Clifton Wintringham about 1720. For 24 years, a statue of Napoleon outside a tobacconist's shop on Lendal was a local landmark. York Post Office remained on the street until 2019, when it moved to Coney Street.

He is the founder and majority shareholder of Gymshark, a fitness apparel and accessories brand headquartered in Solihull, England. Francis has been Gymshark's chief marketing officer since 2018.  Early life  Francis grew up in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. He attended South Bromsgrove High School. He first became interested in computing after studying IT at school. His first business was an online company that sold car license plates. Francis started going to the gym as a teenager. He later said \\"the structure, consistency and work ethic I found in the gym I realised, could be applied to different areas of my life and it would work\\". In 2010, he studied international business and management at Aston University. He paused his studies in 2012 after launching Gymshark. He has said his time at university gave him \\"a strong foundation on which to build a business\\".  Career = Early career  Before launching Gymshark, Francis developed two fitness applications, Fat Loss Abs Guide and iPhysique, which were both listed in the iOS App Store charts. While at university between 2010 to 2013, he worked for Pizza Hut as a delivery boy earning ¬£5 an hour. He left six months after launching Gymshark. In 2012, aged 19, he launched Gymshark in his parents' garage with school friend Lewis Morgan. The website initially sold fitness supplements. Unable to afford to buy stock or secure distribution deals with supplement suppliers, he began dropshipping supplies from other vendors and it took him six weeks to make his first sale. In 2013, Francis co-founded Mani√®re De Voir, a unisex clothing and accessories fashion company based in the UK. He sold his stake in the business in 2018.  Gymshark  Gymshark began life as a supplements company. In 2013, branching out from supplements, Francis began designing and selling fitness apparel on Gymshark's website. He began manufacturing the products from his parent‚Äôs garage in Bromsgrove, using a sewing machine and screen printer he bought with ¬£1,000 of savings. He learned how to sew from his mother. Initially, he worked for Gymshark in between his university studies and job at Pizza Hut. During that time, the company was making an average of ¬£500 of sales per day. In 2013, he exhibited Gymshark's products at the BodyPower fitness trade show in Birmingham. After the trade show ended, a tracksuit went viral on Facebook, generating ¬£30,000 in sales within 30 minutes. Francis later left university and quit his job at Pizza Hut to focus on the company full-time.

History  Indie Campers was founded in Lisbon in 2013 by a Portuguese, Hugo Oliveira, who had the business idea after returning from a trip in Australia, in 2012. The business was launched alongside his Austrian friend, Stefan Koeppl with the guidance of the \\"Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs\\", sponsored by the European Union. In 2014, to pursue a career as a venture capital investor, Stefan Koeppl sold his stake in Indie Campers, leaving Hugo Oliveria as the sole shareholder for the company. In 2015, Indie Campers raised its first financing round (seed round), sponsored by Portugal Ventures at one forty thousand euros. The participation was reacquired in 2017 by the founder and CEO Hugo Oliveria, for seven fifty thousand euros, after the company's internationalization and growth objectives were achieved. Between 2015 and 2017, Indie Campers grew from 3 to 80 employees, headquartered in Portugal with multiple operational locations across Europe, and multiplied its turnover four times each year. In January of 2018, they announced hiring of 150 new employees in areas of operations, customer support, marketing and finance.

Etymology In Old Persian, the written language of Achaemenid inscriptions, the word used to refer to the 'navy' or 'fleet' was \\"nƒÅva\\", a noun in plural feminine nominative form. It is of the same root of Indo-Europian for words such as \\"navy\\" and \\"navigate\\". In modern usage of Persian language, the word has retained its form and meaning (). Historiography No relevant primary documents have been found about it, nor ruins of Persian naval installations or remains of ships have been excavated. While independent Persian tradition is lost, all we know about Achaemenid navy is recorded by ancient Greek historians like Herodotus. As a result, contemporary perception regarding this navy is plausible hypothesis. History Scholars categorize the record of operation of the navy to two distinct periods from 525 to 479, and from 479 to 330 BC. The First Period (525‚Äì479 BC) Cambyses founded the navy for conquest of Egypt in the Battle of Pelusium (525 BC). After him, Darius I deployed the navy to strengthen dominance over the coast of Asia Minor, as well as its adjacent islands. During reign of Darius, Persians captured Samos ( 517 BC), conquered Thrace, waged war Scythia ( 512 BC), and suppressed rebellions started in 500 BC leading to Battle of Lade (494 BC). The Second Period (479‚Äì330 BC) The navy had lost its presence in the Aegean Sea, and its strength was reduced. In the Battle of the Eurymedon ( 468 BC), the Persians were defeated and lost 200 ships according to the account of Thucydides. The next defeat occurred in 450 BC, when they lost war in Cyprus (near modern-day Larnaca). Organization Creating the organization, infrastructure, and financial basis of the Achaemenid navy is attributed to Darius I. BasesHeadquarters= Coasts of Phoenicia, as well as Cyprus and Cilicia, always played an strategic role in Achaemenid navy. Strabo and Herodotus have mentioned two central bases for the navy: one in Cilicia and the other in Kyme‚ÄìPhocaea (both located in modern-day Turkey). Centers that trained crew for vessels were isolated from the central bases. The Cilician base was heavily guarded by a large number of troopers stationed at a garrison, whose payments were financed by the local tributes in that satrapy. It is likely that Acco served as the third main base. According to Kaveh Farrokh, the first naval headquarters that hosted high command of the navy was located along the Shatt al-Arab, where it leads to the Persian Gulf (located in the modern-day Khuzestan Province of Iran). However, Cilicia was the main base and was always ready for deployment because unlike Shatt al-Arab, it was intended for power projection. =Other naval bases= Smaller squadrons were stationed elsewhere, like those of Sidon and Halicarnassus, as well as Samos. An important base was a shipyard located at Tripolis, where Lebanese timber were nearby. Nile valley also served as an strategic base of operation, when Egypt was a satrapy. The same situation applied to Cyprus. Achaemenid settlements like Bahrain, Oman, Yemen and the Indian subcontinent were regular destinations for naval ships. It is likely that bases existed in Abdera and Myus, though this is uncertain. Area of operations The naval forces had active presence in the Black Sea, the Aegean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf among others. They operated patrols in river or littoral environments like Shatt al-Arab and Euphrates in Mesopotamia, Nile in Egypt and Sind in the Indian subcontinent. Command hierarchy and personnel The command hierarchy of the navy is not certain, but Greek sources indicate that high commanders were selected from the imperial aristocracy. There are reports of commanders of ships, and commanding officers of fleets with various non-Persians backgrounds, such as those of Carians. Commanders of Greek origin are also reported to have served in the navy, including even one Athenian. Almost nothing is known about sailors of lower rank. In the wake of creating the navy, Persians hired Phoenician rowers and sailors, but later recruited from other subject peoples. The marines standing in the forces were either Persians, Medes, or Scythians. The servicemen were probably employed with full payment, because lengthy deployments imposed a drastic change to their communities especially if it included one or two harvests. Fleet Prow of galley with hornlike akrostolion ( 350-333 BC) Mazaeus coin depicting a pentekonter ( 353-333 BC) Galley on a Sidonian coin ( 425-401 BC) Vessel on a Sidonian coin ( 435-425 BC)  Vessels  The first Achaemenid naval vessels which were build at Phoenician shipyards, measured in length and width, and were capable of carrying 300 troops at best. According to Christopher Tuplin, Cypriot ships \\"appear a significant element in Persian fleets on various occasions\\". = Persian triremes = The Persians were the first nation to use triremes in enormous scale. In fact, the first to commission a large trireme was Cambyses. By 490 BC, the backbone of the fleet was consisted of triremes while Athens had a few after 483 BC. Some triremes were modified as troopers, as well as some for carrying horses and supplies or building bridges. ;Design and dimensions Persian triremes differed from those of the Greek, and used Phoenician design. The third level of rowers in Greek vessels by adding a outrigger, but the Persians added to the height of the compartment to accommodate them. They reportedly were to long and had a beam of . The ships were most likely capable of reaching under good sailing conditions. They could reach full speed in 30 seconds from a dead stop. Equipped with one mast with square sail, the triremes had rudder made up of two bladed oars, one on each side of stern, united by a crossbar. The ram was made out of bronze, and was long and tapered to a single point. ;Armaments The metal rams were designed to slice into the hulls of enemy ships after an impact. Equipment in the vessels included grappling hooks (used to catch and halt enemy ships) and two mangonels, the latter throwing stones or flammable projectiles. ;Crew A typical Persian trireme is reported to have had 170 rowers, with the upper file carrying 62, and the middle and lower files each 54. In addition to the rowers, other personnel aboard triremes included 14 marines and some spare rowers and oars in case needed. In 480 BC, each trireme carried 200 men and 30 marines, according to Herodotus. Triremes were too crowded to store their own supplies, and relied on support vessels for food and water. It was normal for the crew to disembark in the evening for eating and sleep. = Other warships = Achaemenid navy later used more advanced vessels like quinqueremes. Other types of vessel in the fleet were triaconters, penteconter and light boats. Smaller vessels used for river patrols could carry a maximum of 100‚Äì200 troops. = Transport vessels = The navy operated a large number of vessels used to carry food and other supplies, which commonly had a displacement of 100 to 150 tons, at the time they invaded Egypt in 373 BC. Ships capable of carrying 350 to 500 tons were also used in significant numbers. They also had horse transporters (hippagogoi) specifically built for this purpose, that could easily carry 30 horses. Persian horse transport ships were good sailing ships that took advantage of the favorable winds, according to Anthony J. Papalas, who adds they were probably designed to match the speed of a trireme. It is probable that horse transports were galleys with a shallow draft, that allowed horses get off in the waters and embark via a ramp. = Bridge vessels = The Achaemenids are known to have used vessels for connecting the banks of rivers. The bridges were built by joining vessels to one another and lashing them together, in order to erect a roadway with planks. Xenophon reports such bridges, one made using 37 boats on Tigris, and another using seven on Maeander.  Size  During its early years under Cambyses, the Achaemenid navy is assumed to possess about 300 triremes, which was equal to the sum of the fleet of Egypt and its ally Polycrates of Samos. This number was later doubled, with 600 triremes mentioned in 494 and 490 BC. The initial set-up of the navy (300 triremes) may have had up to 51,000 rowers and thousands of sailors and marines. The original number of vessels in the fleet was eventually quadrupled, according to Greek sources. Herodotus' account of naval forces under Xerxes I, put the number of warships in service at 1,207, in addition to 3,000 transport ships. Contemporary academic estimates range from 500 to 1,000 vessels, according to Matt Waters. Scholars maintain that this number included large numbers of reserve ships, and the navy had not enough full oar crews to operate them all. Herodotus also states that Persians arrived for the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) with 600 triremes and some horse transport vessels. Though the number is rejected by some academics, Anthony J. Papalas states that evidence does support this report. Considering that each ship had an average of 50 oarsmen (the absolute minimum for a tririme) and 10 to 20 seamen and marines were also aboard, the navy compromised 36,000 to 42,000 men, at least. After the Battle of Salamis (480 BC), the fleet began to decline and never regained its status at peak. The largest figure estimated after 404 BC is 400 triremes. The number was still equal to, if not more than, fleets of the Athenian alliance. Flag Xenophon wrote in Anabasis, \\"his (Cyrus the Younger) ensign was a golden eagle with outspread wings mounted upon a long shaft and this continues even unto this day as the ensign of the Persian king\\". While there is not much to confirm this, some scholars maintain that Alexander Mosaic contained a depiction of the standard (on the part which is now damaged), head of a bird in yellow on a red cloth. There is also a square plaque found at Apadana in plain, and it is quite possible that it shows the eagle. Impact and legacy Achaemenid navy was the first true \\"imperial navy\\" that appeared in the history. Persians are also credited for establishing the 'trireme navy' as the new naval standard of their time. The establishment of the Achaemenid navy set the basis of Iranian naval engineering, as well as \\"a powerful Persian maritime tradition that remained in the region until the arrival of the British East India Company and the Royal Navy by the mid-19th century AD\\". The naval forces affected the coastal subjects of the Achaemenid Empire to a great extent. They were put under much tighter control from the capital, and were heavily involved in military campaigns of the Achaemenids. The Sidonians profited financially from the naval base stationed in their city.

The battalion would see only light service during the initial stages of the conflict with the Chasseurs des Ardennes in the Eastern Pyrenees, but its lineage ended in 1794 when it amalgamated with two volunteer battalions to form a demi-brigade. The battalion's successor, the 87√©me R√©giment d'Infanterie continued to service in the modern French Army until it was disbanded in 1940 following the Battle of France.  Formation  The Chasseurs du Roussillon was formed from two cadres from the R√©giment Royal‚ÄìItalien and two full companies of the R√©giment Royal‚ÄìCorse, which when completed began to recruit from the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne regions of the Eastern Pyrenees. That year, the battalion moved to Pont-Saint-Esprit and established its headquarters there. The battalion was placed 12th in precedence of the chasseurs, the last number under the desertion of the R√©giment des Gardes Fran√ßaises, and placed after the Chasseurs des Ardennes.Susane, Volume I, pp. 311, 313‚Äì314, 364, 369, 399, 404.Susane, Volume VII, pp. 389. The regiment's first uniform consisted of; black tricone (officers in bicorne), crimson collar, dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, dark green pockets, crimson cuff flaps, dark green cuffs, and white buttons.Lienhart & Humbet, pp. 57‚Äì58.Smith, Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 42‚Äì47. After establishing its headquarters in Pont-Saint-Esprit, the battalion then moved later that year to Al√®s in early 1791 just before the revolution.  Revolution  Regimental uniform after the 1791 provisional regulations, showing the new casque helmet. On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution, and the regiment renamed as the 12√©me Bataillon de Chasseurs (Roussillon), but they continued to be known as their former title until 1792. In addition to the new title, the regiment adopted a new uniform; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, crimson collar, dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, dark green pockets, crimson cuff flaps, dark green cuffs, and white buttons.  War of the First Coalition = Perpignan Insurrection  Just as the battalion arrived in Perpignan, the majority of the officers emigrated en mass into the local Spanish province of Catalonia. The situation worsened as soon very serious disturbing news arrived that officers of the 20th Infantry and 12th Chasseurs √† Pied had planned to sneak into the town and deliver the citadel to the Spanish who were approaching from the south-west. During the night of the 6 and 7 December, these officers went to the barracks and attempted to seduce the men; but this odious scheme failed, and in the face of patriotism and courage of the 20th infantry's battalion lieutenant-colonel Desbored, who, remained the soldier of their duties, forcing the conspirators to disperse. The battalion would not remain in the area, as just a few days later they moved to Carcassonne, and from there moved to Huningue to join the Army of the Rhine Arm√©e du Rhin.Susane, Volume IV, pp. 46‚Äì49.  The Rhine  On arriving in the Rhine area, the battalion joined the occupation force of Porrentruy, Switzerland, and remained there before joining the Army of the Rhine and Moselle Arm√©e du Rhin et Moselle until its amalgamation in 1794. The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Lev√©e en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi- Brigade of Battle. Therefore, on 8 July 1794, the battalion amalgamated with the 3rd Battalion of the Haute-Sa√¥ne and 2nd Battalion of Lot-et-Garonne to form the 12√©me Demi-Brigade L√©g√®re, thus ending the royalist lineage and traditions.

Robinson, considered the father of cartography as an academic research discipline in the United States, stated that a map not properly designed \\"will be a cartographic failure.\\" He also claimed, when considering all aspects of cartography, that \\"map design is perhaps the most complex.\\" History Charles Joseph Minard's map of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812 (1844) has been long recognized as a masterwork of cartographic design at a time when such was difficult and rare. From ancient times to the 20th Century, cartography was a craft or trade. Most map makers served several years as an apprentice, learning the skills of the master, with little room for innovation other than adapting to changing production technology. That said, there were notable exceptions, such as the occasional introduction of a novel Map projection, and the advent of thematic mapping in the 19th Century highlighted by the work of Charles Dupin and Charles Joseph Minard in France. As late as 1948, Erwin Raisz's General Cartography, the standard English textbook on the subject, reads as a set of instructions of how to construct maps in keeping with tradition, with very little reflection on why it is done that way.Raisz, Erwin, General Cartography, 2nd Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1948 This was despite the fact that Raisz himself was a very creative designer, developing a style of Terrain depiction on physiographic maps that few have been able to replicate.Tyner, Judith, Elements of Cartography: Tracing Fifty Years of Academic Cartography, Cartographic Perspectives, #51 (Spring 2005), 4 Advances in cartographic production technology in the 20th Century, especially the advent and widespread availability of color Offset printing, then a multitude of advances spurred on by World War II, such as Photolithography, gave cartographers a larger palette of design options, and made it easier to creatively innovate. This was synchronized with the widespread expansion of higher education, during which most cartography training transitioned from an apprenticeship to a college degree (typically using Raisz's textbook in America). The new generation of cartography professionals and professors began to reflect on why some maps seemed to be better (in beauty and function) than others, and to think of ways to improve design. Perhaps chief among them was Arthur H. Robinson, whose short but seminal work The Look of Maps (1952) set the stage for the future of cartographic design,Robinson, Arthur, The Look of Maps, University of Wisconsin, 1952 both for his early theorizing about map design, and for his honest acknowledgment of what was not yet known, soon spawning dozens of PhD dissertations. His subsequent textbook, 1953's Elements of Cartography, was a marked departure from the past, with a major focus on design, claiming to \\"present cartography as an intellectual art and science rather than as a sterile system of drafting and drawing procedures.\\" Since the 1950s, a significant focus of Cartography as an academic discipline has been the Cartographic Communication school of thought, seeking to improve design standards through increased scientific understanding of how maps are perceived and used, typically based on cognate disciplines such as psychology (especially perception,Gestalt psychology, and psychophysical experimentation), Human vision, and Geography. Starting in the 1990s, this focus was challenged by the study of Critical cartography, which drew attention to the subjective, societal, and political aspects of map designs. A second major research track has been the investigation of the design opportunities offered by changing Technology, especially Computer graphics starting in the 1960s, Geographic information systems starting in the 1970s, and the Internet starting in the 1990s. However, as much or more of the recent innovation in cartographic design has been at the hands of professional cartographers, and their culture of freely sharing their design ideas through institutions such as the International Cartographic Association and the North American Cartographic Information Society. The cartographic design process As map production and reproduction technology has advanced, the process of designing and producing maps has changed considerably. Most notably, GIS and graphics software not only makes it easier and faster to create a map, but it facilitates a non-linear editing process that is more flexible than in the days of manual cartography. There is still a general procedure that cartographers generally follow:Dent, Borden D., Jeffrey S. Torguson, Thomas W. Hodler, Cartography: Thematic Map Design, 6th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2009, p.205Slocum, Terry A., Robert B. McMaster, Fritz C. Kessler, Hugh H. Howard, Thematic Cartography and Visualization, 3rd Edition, Pearson-Prentice Hall, 2009, p.212 # Planning: The iterative nature of modern cartography makes this step somewhat less involved than before, but it is still crucial to have some form of plan. Typically, this involves answering several questions:Tyner, Judith A., Principles of Map Design, Guilford Press, 2010, p.23 #* What is the purpose of the map? Maps serve a wide variety of purposes; they may be descriptive (showing the accurate location of geographic features to be used in a variety of ways, like a street map), exploratory (showing the distribution of phenomena and their properties, to look for underlying patterns and processes, like many thematic maps), explanatory (educating the audience about a specific topic), or even rhetorical (trying to convince the audience to believe or do something). #* Who is the audience? Maps will be more useful if they cater to the intended audience.Muehrcke, Phillip, An Integrated Approach to Map Design and Production, The American Cartographer, V.9 #2 pp.109-122, doi:10.1559/152304082783948529 This audience could range from the cartographer herself (desiring to learn about a topic by mapping it), to focused individuals or groups, to the general public. Several characteristics of the audience can aid this process, if they can be determined, such as: their level of knowledge about the subject matter and the region being covered; their skill in map reading and understanding of geographic principles (e.g., do they know what 1:100,000 means?); and their needs, motivations and biases. #* Is a map the best solution? There are times when a map could be made, but a chart, photograph, text, or other tool may better server the purpose. #* What datasets are needed? The typical map will require data to serve several roles, including information about the primary purpose, as well as supporting background information. #* What medium should be used? Different mapping media, such as posters, brochures, folded maps, page maps, screen displays, and web maps have advantages and disadvantages for different purposes, audiences, and usage contexts. # Data Collection: In the era of Geographic information systems, it seems like vast amounts of data are available for every conceivable topic, but they must be found and obtained. Frequently, available datasets are not perfect matches for the needs of the project at hand, and must be augmented or edited. Also, it is still common for there to be no available data on the specific topic, requiring the cartographer to create them, or derive them from existing data using GIS tools. # Design and Implementation: This step involves making decisions about all of the aspects of map design, as listed below, and implementing them using computer software. In the manual drafting era, this was a very linear process of careful decision making, in which some aspects needed to be implemented before others (often, projection first). However, current GIS and graphics software enables interactive editing of all of these aspects interchangeably, leading to a non-linear, iterative process of experimentation, evaluation, and refinement. # Production and Distribution: The last step is to produce the map in the chosen medium, and distribute it to the audience. This could be as simple as a desktop printer, or sending it to a press, or developing an interactive Web mapping site. Map design in the Cartographic Process Cartographic design is one part of a larger process in which maps play a central role. This cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including generalization, symbolization, and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind. Design goals While maps serve a variety of purposes, and come in a variety of styles, most designs share common goals. Some of the most commonly stated include: * Accuracy, the degree to which the information on the map corresponds to the nature of the real world. Traditionally, this was the primary determinant of quality cartography. It is now accepted, due largely to studies in Critical cartography, that no dataset or map is a perfect reproduction of reality, and that the subjective biases and motivations of the cartographer are virtually impossible to circumvent. That said, maps can still be crafted to be as accurate as possible, honest about their shortcomings, and leverage their subjectivity. * Functionality, the usefulness of the map to achieve its purpose. During much of the latter 20th Century, this was the primary goal of academic cartography, especially the Cartographic Communication school of thought: to determine how to make the most efficient maps as conduits of information. * Clarity, the degree to which the map makes its purpose obvious and its information easy to access. Clarity can be achieved through removing all but the most important information, but this comes at the expense of other goals. * Richness, the volume and diversity of information the reader can glean from the map. Even maps with a narrowly- defined purpose often require the reader to see patterns in large amounts of data. * Aesthetic appeal, a positive emotional reaction to the overall appearance of the map. Maps may be appreciated as \\"beautiful,\\" but other positive affects include \\"interesting,\\" \\"engaging,\\" \\"convincing,\\" and \\"motivating.\\" Aesthetic reactions can be negative as well, such as \\"ugly,\\" \\"cluttered,\\" \\"confusing,\\" \\"complicated,\\" \\"annoying,\\" or \\"off-putting.\\" These goals often seem to be in conflict, and it may be tempting to prioritize one over the others. However, quality design in cartography, as in any other design field, is about finding creative and innovative solutions to achieve multiple goals. According to Edward Tufte,Tufte, Edward, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd Edition, Graphics Press, 2001, p.191 In fact, good design can produce synergistic results. Even aesthetics can have practical value: potential map users are more likely to pick up, and more likely to spend time with, a beautiful map than one that is difficult to look at. In turn, the practical value of maps has gained aesthetic appeal, favoring those that exude a feeling of being \\"professional,\\" \\"authoritative,\\" \\"well- crafted,\\" \\"clear,\\" or \\"informative.\\" In 1942, cartographer John K. Wright said,Wright, John K., Map Makers are Human, Geographical Review, V. 32, p.542 Rudolf Arnheim, the art theorist whose ideas about aesthetics have probably been more influential on modern cartography than anyone else, said about this relationship in 1976: Map purpose and selection of information 3D cartography of Washington State, Mount Rainier National Park, Pinnacle Peak trail. Robinson codified the mapmaker's understanding that a map must be designed foremost with consideration to the audience and its needs, stating that from the very beginning of mapmaking, maps \\"have been made for some particular purpose or set of purposes\\". The intent of the map should be illustrated in a manner in which the percipient (the map reader) acknowledges its purpose in a timely fashion. The principle of figure-ground refers to this notion of engaging the user by presenting a clear presentation, leaving no confusion concerning the purpose of the map. This will enhance the user's experience and keep their attention. If the user is unable to identify what is being demonstrated in a reasonable fashion, the map may be regarded as useless. Making a meaningful map is the ultimate goal. Alan MacEachren explains that a well designed map \\"is convincing because it implies authenticity\\". (p. 9) An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \\"needed link\\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it. p. 93 In the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the human body to the virtual worlds of cyberspace. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map ‚Äì for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by public transport organisations to guide passengers, namely urban rail and metro maps, many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by Harry Beck and George Dow. Aspects of Design Unlike cognate disciplines such as Graphic design, Cartography is constrained by the fact that geographic phenomena are where and what they are. However, within that framework the cartographer has a great deal of control over many aspects of the map. Cartographic data and generalization The widespread availability of data from Geographic information systems, especially free data such as OpenStreetMap, has greatly shortened the time and cost of creating most maps. However, this part of the design process is still not trivial. Exisiting GIS data, often created for management or research purposes, is not always in a form that is most suited to a particular map purpose, and data frequently need to be augmented, edited, or updated to be useful. Some sources, especially in Europe, refer to the former as a Digital Landscape Model, and spatial data that are fine-tuned for map design as a Digital Cartographic Model.Kraak, Menno-Jan, Ferjan Ormeling, Cartography: Visualization of Geospatial Data, 2nd Edition, Prentice-Hall, 2003, p.3 A significant part of this transformation is generalization, a set of procedures for adjusting the amount of detail (geometry and attributes) in datasets to be appropriate for a given map. All maps portray a small, strategic sample of the infinite amount of potential information in the real world; the strategy for that sample is largely driven by the scale, purpose, and audience of the map. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a slightly incorrect place. Most often, generalization starts with detailed data created for a larger scale, and strategically removes information deemed to be unnecessary for a smaller scale map. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space on the ground. For example, a 2mm thick highway symbol on a map at a scale of 1:1,000,000 occupies a space 2 km wide, leaving no room for roadside features. In the late 1980s, the Ordnance Survey's first digital maps, where the absolute positions of major roads were sometimes moved hundreds of meters from their true location on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000 (the generalization technique of displacement), because of the overriding need to annotate the features. Projections The Equal Earth projection (2018), an increasingly popular equal-area pseudocylindrical projection for world maps Because the Earth is (nearly) spherical, any planar representation (a map) requires it to be flattened in some way, known as a projection. Most map projections are implemented using mathematical formulas and computer algorithms based on geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude). All projections generate distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved. The mapmaker must choose a suitable map projection according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map; this decision process becomes increasingly important as the scope of the map increases; while a variety of projections would be indistinguishable on a city street map, there are dozens of drastically different ways of projecting the entire world, with extreme variations in the type, degree, and location of distortion. Symbology Map of Biscayne National Park, Florida, using a variety of point symbols, along with line and area symbols. Note the use of coordinated fill and stroke symbols for the national park area to solve the challenge of a water boundary. Cartographic symbology encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map. National topographic map series, for example, adopt a standardised symbology, which varies from country to country. Jacques Bertin, in S√©miologie Graphique (1967), introduced a system of codifying graphical elements (including map symbols) that has been a part of the canon of Cartographic knowledge ever since.Jacque Bertin, S√©miologie Graphique. Les diagrammes, les r√©seaux, les cartes. With Marc Barbut [et al.]. Paris : Gauthier-Villars. Semiology of Graphics, English Edition, Translation by William J. Berg, University of Wisconsin Press, 1983.) He analyzed graphical objects in terms of three aspects (here using current terminology): * Dimension: The basic type of geometric shape used to represent a geographic phenomenon, commonly points (marker symbols), lines (stroke symbols), or areas (fill symbols), as well as fields. * Level of measurement: the basic type of property being visualized, generally using the classification of Stanley Smith Stevens (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio), or some extension thereof. * Visual variable: the graphical components of a symbol, including shape, size, color, orientation, pattern, transparency, and so on. Thus, a map symbol consists of a number of visual variables, graphically representing the location and spatial form of a geographic phenomenon, as well as zero or more of its properties. For example, 23px might represent the point location of a facility, with shape being used to represent that the facility type is \\"mine\\" (a nominal property). This symbol would be intuitively understood by many users without any explanation. On a Choropleth map of median income, might represent an area location of a county, with hue and value being used to represent that the income is US$50,000 (a ratio property). This is an example of an ad hoc symbol with no intrinsic meaning, requiring a legend for users to discover the intended meaning. Composition A well-composed transit map of Istanbul, with a high degree of contrast between the symbols, creating a strong visual hierarchy (transit lines are and look most important), figure-ground, and selectivity (the green national rail line can be isolated when necessary). Also note the harmonizing subdued tones of green and blue in the background. The term map composition is sometimes used to refer to the composition of the symbols within the map itself, and sometimes to the composition of the map and other elements on the page. Some of the same principles apply to both processes, while others are unique to each. In the former sense of the symbols on the map, as all of the symbols and thematic layers on the map are brought together, their interactions have major effects on map reading. A number of composition principles have been studied in cartography. While some of these ideas were posited by Arthur H. Robinson in The Look of Maps (1952), Borden Dent was likely the first to approach it in a systematic way in 1972, firmly within the Cartographic Communication school of thought.Borden D. Dent, ‚ÄúVisual Organization and Thematic Map Communication,‚Äù Annals of the Association of American Geographers 62, no. 1 (1972) Dent's model drew heavily on psychology, especially Gestalt psychology and Perception, to evaluate what made some maps difficult to read as a whole, even when individual symbols were designed well, and creating a model that included most of the list below. Later, artistic composition principles were adopted from graphic design, many of which are similar, having come from similar sources. They all share the same goal: to combine all of the individual symbols into a single whole that achieves the goals above. * Contrast is the degree of visual difference between graphic elements (e.g., map symbols). Robinson saw contrast as the fundamental principle of composition, supporting everything else. As suggested by Robinson, and further developed by Jacques Bertin, contrast is created by manipulating the visual variables of map symbols, such as size, shape, and color. * Figure-ground is the ease with which each individual symbol or feature (the figure) can be mentally isolated from the rest of the map (the ground). The rules for establishing figure-ground are largely drawn from the gestalt principle of Pr√§gnanz. * Visual hierarchy is the apparent order of items, from those that look most important (i.e., attract the most attention) to those that look least important. Typically, the intent is for the visual hierarchy to match the intellectual hierarchy of what is intended to be more or less important. Bertin suggested that some of the visual variables, especially size and value, naturally contributed to visual hierarchy (which he termed as dissociative), while others had differences that were more easily ignored. * Grouping (Dent) or Selectivity (Bertin) is the ease with which a reader can isolate all of the symbols of a particular appearance, while ignoring the rest of the map, allowing the reader to identify patterns in that type of feature (e.g., \\"where are all the blue dots?\\"). In Bertin's model, size, value, and hue were particularly selective, while others, such as shape, require significant contrast to be useful. * Harmony is how well all of the individual elements (map symbols) \\"look good\\" together. This generally follows from the above principles, as well as the careful selection of harmonious colors, textures, and typefaces. Map types A wide variety of different types of maps have been developed, and are available to use for different purposes. In addition to the general principles of cartographic design, some types of visualizations have their its own design needs, constraints, and best practices. A map of Sikkim, India using shaded relief and hypsometric tints (a form of isarithm) to visualize terrain * Terrain/Relief/Topography. Several methods have been developed for visualizing elevation and the shape of the Earth's surface. Some techniques date back hundreds or thousands of years and are difficult to replicate digitally, such hill profiles and hachures; others, such as shaded relief and contour lines, are much easier to produce in GIS than using manual tools. Some of these methods are designed for analytical use, such as measuring slope on contours, but most are intended to produce an intuitive visual representation of the terrain. * A Choropleth map visualizes statistical data that has been aggregated into a priori districts (such as countries or counties) using area symbols based on the visual variables of color and/or pattern. Choropleth maps are by far the most popular kind of thematic maps due to the widespread availability of aggregated statistical data (such as census data, but the nature of aggregate data can result in significant misinterpretation issues, such as the Ecological fallacy and the Modifiable areal unit problem, which can be somewhat mitigated by careful design. ** A Dasymetric map is a hybrid type that uses additional data sources to refine the boundaries of a choropleth map (especially through excluding uninhabited areas), thereby mitigating some of the sources of misinterpretation. * A Proportional symbol map visualizes statistical data of point symbols, often circles, using the visual variable of size. The underlying data may be of point features, or it may be the same aggregate data used in choropleth maps. In the latter case, the two map types are often complimentary, as variables that are inappropriate to represent in one type are well-suited for the other. * A Cartogram purposefully distorts the size of areal features proportional to a chosen variable, such as total population, and thus may be thought of as a hybrid between choropleth and proportional symbol maps. Several automated and manual techniques have been developed to construct cartograms, each having advantages and disadvantages. Frequently, the resultant shapes are filled as a choropleth map representing a variable thought to relate in some way to the area variable. * An Isarithmic map (or isometric or isopleth or contour) represents a continuous field by interpolating lines wherein the field variable has equal value (an isoline). The lines themselves and/or the intervening regions may be symbolized. Some choropleth maps may be thought of as rough approximations of isarithmic maps, and dasymetric maps as slightly better approximations. ** A Continuous tone map represents a continuous field as smoothly transitioning color (hue, value, and/or saturation), usually based on a raster grid. Some have considered this to be a special type of unclassified isarithmic map, while others consider it to be something fundamentally different.Mark P. Kumler & Richard E. Groop (1990) Continuous-Tone Mapping of Smooth Surfaces, Cartography and Geographic Information Systems, 17:4, 279-289, DOI: 10.1559/152304090783805681 A chorochromatic map of world land cover, using hue, value, and saturation to differentiate nominal values * A Chorochromatic map (or area-class) visualizes a discrete/nominal Field (geography) as a set of regions of homogeneous value. * A Dot distribution map (or dot density) visualizes the density of an aggregate group as representative dots (each of which may represent a single individual or a constant number of individuals). The source data may be the actual point locations of the individuals, or choropleth-type aggregate district statistics. * A Flow map focuses on lines of movement. A wide variety of flow maps exist, depending on whether flow volume is represented (usually using visual variables such as stroke weight or color value), and whether the route of flow is shown accurately (such as a navigation route on a Road map) or schematically (such as a Transit map or airline route map) Although these are called separate \\"maps,\\" they should be thought of as single map layers, which may be combined with other thematic or feature layers in a single map composition. Labeling and typography CIA map of Iraq, following typical labeling guidelines to maximize legibility and association Text serves a variety of purposes on maps. Most directly, it identifies features on the map by name; in addition, it helps to classify features (as in \\"Jones Park\\"); it can explain information; it can help to locate features, in some cases on its own without a geometric map symbol (esp. natural features); it plays a role in the gestalt of the map, especially the visual hierarchy; and it contributes to the aesthetic aspects of the map, including its \\"look and feel\\" and its attractiveness. While the cartographer has a great deal of freedom in choosing the style and size of type to accomplish these purposes, two basic goals are seen as crucial:Guidero, E. (2017). Typography. The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge (3rd Quarter 2017 Edition), John P. Wilson (ed.). DOI: 10.22224/gistbok/2017.3.2 * Legibility, the ease with which map users can read a particular piece of text. Map labels introduce unique challenges to legibility, due to their tendency to be small, unfamiliar, irregularly spaced, and placed on top of map symbols.Jill Saligoe- Simmel,\\"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\\" * Association, the ease with which map users can recognize which feature a particular piece of text is labeling. This can be especially challenging on general purpose maps containing a large number of varied features and their labels. Most of the elements of labeling design are intended to achieve these two goals, including: the choice of typefaces, type style, size, color, and other visual variables; halos, masks, leader lines, and other additional symbols; decisions about what to label and what to not label; label text content; and label placement. While many of these decisions are specific to the particular map, functional label placement tends to follow a number of rules that have been developed through cartographic research, which has led to automated algorithms to place them automatically, to a reasonable degree of quality. =Placenames= One challenge for map labeling is dealing with varying preferences of place names. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name Germany for that country, while a German map would use Deutschland and a French map Allemagne. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an exonym. Sometimes a name may be disputed, such as Myanmar vs. Burma. Further difficulties arise when transliteration or transcription between writing systems is required. Some well-known places have well- established names in other languages and writing systems, such as Russia or Ru√üland for –†–æ—Å—Å–∏ÃÅ—è, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Sometimes multiple transliteration systems exist; for example, the Yemeni city of ÿßŸÑŸÖÿÆÿß‚Äé is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-MakhƒÅ, al-Makha, Mocca and Moka. Some transliteration systems produce such different place names as to cause confusion, such as the transition of Chinese-English transliteration from Wade-Giles (Peking, Kwangchow) to Pinyin (Beijing, Guangzhou). Map Layout Geologic map of Australia, including a main map image, title, metadata, inset maps, scale bars, and legends. A typical map, whether on paper or on a web page, consists of not only the map image, but also other elements that support the map: * A title tells the reader what the map is about, including the purpose or theme, and perhaps the region covered. * A legend or key explains the meaning of the symbols on the map * A neatline may frames the entire map image, although many maps use negative space to set the map apart * A compass rose or north arrow provides orientation * Inset maps may serve several purposes, such as showing the context of the main map in a larger area, showing more detail for a subset of the main map, showing a separated but related area, or showing related themes for the same region. * A bar scale or other indication of scale translates between map measurements and real distances. * Illustrations may be included to help explain the map subject or add aesthetic appeal. * Explanatory text may discuss the subject further * Metadata declares the sources, date, authorship, projection, or other information about the construction of the map. Composing and arranging all of the elements on the page involves just as much design skill and knowledge of how readers will use the map as designing the map image itself. Page composition serves several purposes, including directing the reader's attention, establishing a particular aesthetic feel, clearly stating the purpose of the map, and making the map easier to understand and use. Therefore, Page layout follows many of the same principles of Composition above, including figure-ground and Visual hierarchy, as well as aesthetic principles adopted from Graphic design, such as balance and the use of White space (visual arts). In fact, this aspect of cartographic design has more in common with graphic design than any other part of the craft. Map reproduction and distribution At one time, the process of getting a map printed was a major part of the time and effort spent in cartography. While less of a concern with modern technology, it is not insignificant. Professional cartographers are asked to produce maps that will be distributed by a variety of media, and understanding the various reproduction and distribution technologies help to cater a design to work best for the intended medium. * Inkjet printing * Laser printing * Offset printing, including Prepress preparation * Animated mapping * Web mapping See also * Cartography * Map * Geographic information systems References Category:Cartography Category:Graphic design ","title":"Cartographic design"},{"id":"64920876","text":"Eve Biddle (born 1982) is a contemporary American artist and co-founder and co-director of the arts organization The Wassaic Project.

Life  Born in (today part of Sprockh√∂vel), Heuser was the son of a teacher and attended the . There, he belonged to the youth friends of Friedrich Engels. On 18 March 1837 he left the Gymnasium to study at the Royal Music Institute of Berlin. At the same time, he took composition lessons with Adolf Bernhard Marx and was soon considered a great talent. In 1840 Engels wrote the opera libretto Cola di Rienzo,Friedrich Engels for Heuser. Cola di Rienzi. Ein unbekannter dramatischer Entwurf, edited by Michael Knieriem, Wuppertal: Peter Hammer 1974 which Heuser did not set to music, however.

[1] On 18 November 1841 Heuser was recommended by Marx to Robert Schumann. He addressed Schumann himself the same day and subsequently wrote several essays for the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik in which he discussed fundamental questions of contemporary music. His hope that Schumann could also help him to publish his compositions, however, was not fulfilled. On 22 August 1844, he paid Schumann a personal visit in Leipzig,Robert Schumann, Tageb√ºcher, vol. 3, edited by Gerd Nauhaus, Leipzig 1982, during which his further collaboration for the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik was probably discussed. Still in the issue of November 7, 1846, \\"Mr. Gustav Heuser in Berlin\\" is expressly referred to as \\"our collaborator\\". In 1846, he sent several musical manuscripts to an alleged publisher named Conrad L√∂ffler, who was soon exposed as a fraud, because L√∂ffler had Heuser's works performed in Vienna under his own name: three string quartets on 26 July and, on 13 August in the Theater an der Wien, Heuser's Ouverture triumphale,Vgl.

Among those who fell for L√∂ffler's tricks was Richard Wagner, who sent L√∂ffler his operas Rienzi, The Flying Dutchman and Tannh√§user in the belief that L√∂ffler would publish them.Cf. Wagner's letters to Franz Liszt of 10 April 1846 and to Conrad L√∂ffler of 20 May 1846, in: Richard Wagner, S√§mtliche Briefe, vol. 2, edited by Gertrud Strobel and Werner Wolf, Leipzig 1970, p. 500f. and 505-507. L√∂ffler posed as a \\"pensioner of the King of Prussia\\" to Wagner. On 19 September 1846, Heuser attended the premiere of Michael Beers Struensee with music by Giacomo Meyerbeer and was seen for the last time the following day. His body was recovered from the Spree in October. It was suspected that he died voluntarily, because \\"he had left his watch and purse in his apartment\\".Zu Heusers Tod vgl. \\"K.

The first Burmese dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Rangoon University in British Burma, Min Sein was one of the small group of senior physicians that rebuilt and expanded the country's medical education system from the ground up after the country's independence in 1948. He served as the dean of the medical school four times between 1947 and 1959, and led the Burma Medical Research Institute, the Burma Medical Association and the Burma Olympic Committee. Early life and education Guy's Hospital in London where Min Sein received training He was born Hoe Min Sein to landowner parents U Sine Hu and Daw Yin Cane on 26 December 1898 in Pyapon in the Irrawaddy delta in British Burma.Who 1961: 146 He went to high school in Rangoon (Yangon), and studied medicine at the University of Calcutta, and graduated with an MB in 1925.RCP Vol. VII: 402 He continued his studies at Guy's Hospital, London from 1927 to 1930, as a clinical assistant to Sir John Conybeare and Sir Charles Symonds. In 1929, he received his MRCP certification from the Royal College of Physicians, and his MRCS from the Royal College of Surgeons of England.Maung Wa 2009: 213‚Äì214 Career Hoe was head of Rangoon General Hospital (1940‚Äì1942) Colonial era Upon return to Burma, Hoe joined the Indian Medical Service, the military medical service of British India on 27 April 1931.Civil List 2014: 55 He joined the service right before the outbreak of an open rebellion by Burmese peasants hit hard by the Great Depression. He served as a battalion medical officer with the British Forces throughout the rebellion (1931‚Äì1932). His rank in 1932 was captain,Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 1932: liii‚Äìliv and he was assigned to work for the government of Burma by the IMS on 26 February 1934.IMG 1934: 296 He became a lecturer in medicine at Rangoon Medical College in 1938, a major on 20 July 1939,Civil List 2014: 55 and the Medical Superintendent (Head) of Rangoon General Hospital in 1940. His career achievements were significant in colonial Burma. The colonial era medical community was mainly made up of foreign-born physicians and specialists that existed primarily in Rangoon (Yangon).(Myint Swe 2014: xi‚Äìxii): About half of the physicians and most of the specialists at Rangoon General Hospital were foreign born. To see a specialist, everyone in the country needed to go to RGH. The \\"small medical system was run mainly by foreigners and the tiny elite for foreigners and the tiny elite.\\" (Myint Swe 2014: 134‚Äì135): It was exceedingly difficult to get into medical school even in the late colonial period. The class size was disproportionately small for the size of country's population (13.2 million in 1921 and 16.8 million in 1941 (per Saito and Lee 1999: 1)). Between 1922 and 1941, a grand total of 543 students graduated from Rangoon Medical College (RMC), or 27 new graduates on average each year. Of the grand total, the number of indigenous Burmese graduates was only 228 (42%), or less than a dozen per year. Indeed, in 1942, he was one of the only four Burmese officers (alongside Lt. Col. Henry Aung Khin, Lt. Col. Alfred Ba Thaw and Capt. Shwe Zan) in the Burma Medical Service (BMS), the successor of the IMS in Burma. (To be sure, some highly qualified Burmese physicians like his own wife Yin May or his RGH colleague Ba Than, both of whom were already FRCS surgeons, did not join the IMS.(Tin Naing Toe 2011): Yin May became the second Burmese woman FRCS in 1929. (Khin Thet-Hta et al 2005: 84): Ba Than received his FRCS in 1932. Yin May did join the BMS after the war in 1946 as a Lt. Col. to run the Lady Dufferin Maternity Hospital.Tin Naing Toe 2011) Hoe left Burma with the British administration to India during the Japanese occupation of Burma (1942‚Äì1945). He was part of the exodus of medical professionals that evacuated the country along with the British administration.Myint Swe 2014: xii His wife remained in Burma, and ended up founding and running the main maternity hospital in Rangoon throughout the war years.Myint Swe 2014: 98‚Äì99 (Hoe, Yin May and their son fled Rangoon in early 1942 to escape the invasion but the family somehow got separated in Upper Burma. He made it to India but his pregnant wife returned to Rangoon alone.(Maung Wa 2009: 121‚Äì122, 213‚Äì214): Maj. Min Sein, Yin May and their son Thein Htut were in Mandalay on 25 March 1942. (Maung Wa 2009: 150): Yin May was in Indaw on 17 April 1942 without her family, and Min Sein sent her brother Thein Kyaw to fetch her. (Myint Swe 2014: 98): Yin May gave birth to a baby in late 1942 in Rangoon as a single mother; Min Sein by then was in India.) He served in the 14th Army from 1942 to 1946 as an Assistant Director, Medical Services (ADMS) and Deputy Director, Medical Services (DDMS). He returned with the British after the war. When the British restarted Rangoon Medical College as the Faculty of Medicine of Rangoon University in 1946, he became the Professor of Medicine (i.e. Head of the Department).UM1 Faculty of Medicine In 1947, Min Sein, as he was known now, became the first ever Burmese dean of the medical school, succeeding the Faculty's first dean Dr. William Burridge.Khin Thet-Hta et al 2005: 11 He was awarded the title of OBE by the British government in 1947,Medical Directory 1947: 2408 and promoted to the rank of Lt. Col. (although he is commonly, if imprecisely, referred to as Col. Min Sein in Burmese publications.)See (RCP 1954) and (RCP 1957) for his retired rank of Lt. Col. In Myanmar, Min Sein's rank is reported as colonel; see (Khin Thet Hta 2005) or (UM1 Department of Medicine). Furthermore, he did not quit the IMS until 1948.BMJ 1948: 110 Post-independence Lanmadaw campus, Faculty of Medicine, Rangoon; now University of Medicine 1, Yangon After the country's independence in 1948, Min Sein was one of the few physicians left in the country. His post-independence career centered on rebuilding and expanding the country's medical education system. He was instrumental in restarting the medical school after the war. After independence, Min Sein and Ba Than took turns being the dean of the medical school for the next 11 years. Ba Than served three terms: 1948‚Äì1949, 1951‚Äì1953, and 1955‚Äì1957 while Min Sein served three more terms: 1949‚Äì1951, 1953‚Äì1955, and 1957‚Äì1959, (in addition to his 1947‚Äì1948 term before independence.) Min Sein also served as the Professor of Medicine from 1946 to 1959.The web page of the University of Medicine 1, Yangon (UM1 Dept. of Medicine) says he served from 1945 to 1959. But as per its own page (UM1 Faculties), the medical school was reopened only on 26 September 1946, and Min Sein was appointed as its head only then. Under their leadership, the country produced 532 MBBS graduates between 1948 and 1957 in comparison to the 543 graduates between 1922 and 1941 during the colonial era.Myint Swe 2014: 263 Min Sein also represented the country on several occasions. He was a member of or leader of the country's missions to the UK, the US (1952), the USSR (1954) and Japan (1958).Who's Who 2005: 377 From 1956 to 1958, he was a member of the Expert Committee on Maternal and Child Health of the WHO,Congress 1957: 68 and a member of the Technical and Scientific committee, WHO. He also took on several roles in various national associations ranging from the Burma Medical Association (president, 1955‚Äì1956), the National Health Council, the National Fitness Council, and the Burma Olympic Committee (1948) to the Opium Enquiry Commission and the Racing Enquiry Commission. He was also president of the Britain-Burma Society, vice-president of the Burma Veterans League, and president of the Burma Medical Research Institute. He retired from his twin roles as the Dean of the medical school and Professor of Medicine in 1959. He was succeeded by Maung Gale as dean,UM1 Facutlty of Medicine and Shwe Zan as Professor of Medicine.UM1 Dept. of Medicine He received his FRCP fellowship from the Royal College Physicians at the end of his career in 1959. For his services, he was awarded the title of Thiri Pyanchi by the Burmese government in 1949. He also received his CBE title from the British government by 1970.Per (RCP 1967: 24), he was still an OBE in 1967. But per (RCP 1970: 98), he had become a CBE by 1970.

A geometric shape with an area of 32 units is dissected into four parts, which afterwards get assembled into a rectangle with an area of only 30 units. Explanation  explanation of Hooper's paradox, the brown parallelogram is the overlapping area of the two triangles Upon close inspection one can notice that the triangles of the dissected shape are not identical to the triangles in the rectangle. The length of the shorter side at the right angle measures 2 units in the original shape but only 1.8 units in the rectangle. This means, the real triangles of the original shape overlap in the rectangle. The overlapping area is a parallelogram, the diagonals and sides of which can be computed via the Pythagorean theorem. : d_1=\\\\sqrt{2^2+1^2}=\\\\sqrt{5} : d_2=\\\\sqrt{3^2+10^2}=\\\\sqrt{109} : s_1=\\\\sqrt{2^2+6^2}=\\\\sqrt{40} : s_2=\\\\sqrt{1^2+4^2}=\\\\sqrt{17} The area of this parallelogram can determined using Heron's formula for triangles. This yields : s=\\\\frac{d_1+s_1+s_2}{2}=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}+\\\\sqrt{17}+\\\\sqrt{40}}{2} for the halved circumference of the triangle (half of the parallelogram) and with that for the area of the parallelogram : \\\\begin{align} F&=2\\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{s\\\\cdot (s-s_1) \\\\cdot (s-s_2) \\\\cdot (s-d_1)} [5pt] &=2\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{(\\\\sqrt{5}+\\\\sqrt{17}+\\\\sqrt{40})\\\\cdot(-\\\\sqrt{5}+\\\\sqrt{17}+\\\\sqrt{40})\\\\cdot(\\\\sqrt{5}-\\\\sqrt{17}+\\\\sqrt{40})\\\\cdot(\\\\sqrt{5}+\\\\sqrt{17}-\\\\sqrt{40})} [5pt] &=2\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{16} [5pt] &=2 \\\\end{align} . So the overlapping area of the two triangles accounts exactly for the vanished area of 2 units.  History  William Hooper published the paradox 1774 in his book Rational Recreations in which he named it The geometric money. The 1774 edition of his book still contained a false drawing, which got corrected in the 1782 edition. However Hooper was not the first to publish this geometric fallacy, since Hooper's book was largely an adaption of Edm√©-Gilles Guyot's Nouvelles r√©cr√©ations physiques et math√©tiques, which had been published in France in 1769. The description in this book contains the same false drawing as in Hooper's book, but it got corrected in a later edition as well.  References  *Martin Gardner: Mathematics, Magic and Mystery.

It is situated within the Mount Baker Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is Winchester Mountain, to the east, and Mount Larrabee is set to the northeast. The summit offers views of Mount Larrabee, Tomyhoi Peak, American Border Peak, Canadian Border Peak, Mount Shuksan, and Mount Baker. Precipitation runoff on the north side of the mountain drains into Tomyhoi Creek, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into Damfino Creek, and the south slope is drained by Swamp Creek. Access The Tomyhoi Lake Trail (#686) is accessed by the Twin Lakes Road (Forest Service #3065 in the North Fork Nooksack area) off of the Mount Baker Highway. The junction with the Yellow Aster Butte Trail (#686.1) is about 1.5 mile from the road. Climate Yellow Aster Butte is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains.West aspect centered. Mount Larrabee to left As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It is constructed of buff-colored brick and concrete, with a flat roof. On the east side is a one-story detached annex constructed of buff- colored brick and concrete. The first courthouse was erected in 1880. The second courthouse was a two-story structure built from 1886 to 1887 of red- colored brick and native stone with a tall central cupola with space for four clock faces; the clock was never purchased.

History The recording of the songs on Volt, which were intended to be Trip Shakespeare's fifth album, followed two albums for major label A&M; Records, Across the Universe and Lulu. Both were critically well-reviewed but suffered from low sales. Inspired by the then-current 1992 Los Angeles riots, the band chose songs about peace, revolution and freedom as a unifying concept for the album. A&M; initially encouraged the project, but became unsure how to market it. A&M;'s promotions department, upon hearing the album, responded by saying \\"What do we do with this?\\", according to bassist John Munson. The label eventually rejected Volt and dropped Trip Shakespeare from its roster. The band broke up soon afterwards. Trip Shakespeare bought back the Volt songs from the label and released it on Clean, the Minneapolis independent label which had put out its first records. Reception The album had a mixed reception from critics. Gregory McIntosh of AllMusic wrote that none of the songs were \\"particularly gripping, but there are some great moments as well as fun listens for fans of Trip Shakespeare.\\" Chris Morris of Billboard praised the \\"stunning, harmony- laden\\" and \\"sharp selection of covers.\\" Courtney King of Tennessee newspaper The Jackson Sun called Volt \\"enjoyable,\\" singling out the \\"upbeat and peppy\\" version of \\"Peace Love, and Understanding,\\" calling it \\"a really good song to slam to if you do it at a moderate pace,\\" but felt that the band did better with its original compositions.

From 1993 to 1996, Rawson served as an ambassador to Rwanda, a nation then experiencing ethnic tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis. When the plane of Rwandan president Juv√©nal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down, the Hutus blamed it on the Tutsis, leading to a genocide between April and July of 1994. The United States government ordered American officials, including Rawson, to leave the country. After the Rwandan Patriotic Front took control of the government in July 1994, Rawson returned to Rwanda to provide emergency relief and to negotiate peace agreements. Rawson later stated, however, that he believed he failed in his role as a peacekeeper during his tenure as ambassador. From 1996 to 1999, Rawson served as the U.S. ambassador to the Republic of Mali.  Post-diplomatic career  After retiring from foreign affairs in 1999, Rawson moved to Michigan and taught at Spring Arbor University and Hillsdale College. After 2018 Rawson lived in Oregon and taught at George Fox University. He donated his personal archives to the university, including declassified documents used in the research of his book Prelude to Genocide: Arusha, Rwanda, and the Failure of Diplomacy.  Personal life  Rawson's first wife died in an automobile accident in 1977. He was in the vehicle at the time of the crash and stated that this incident was the \\"most trying circumstance\\" of his life. Rawson was a Christian.

Her research considers telomerase RNA structure and telomere function. In 2020 she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Early life and education  Collins was a graduate student at the Whitehead Institute.  Research and career  Collins joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley in 1995. Her research has considered the structure and function of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that protects chromosomes by replacing the telomere, a short section of DNA lost from the ends of chromosomes during DNA replication. It was first detected in the late 1970s by Elizabeth Blackburn.The telomere prevents the chromosomes from fusing. Most cells turn off telomerase, restricting their proliferation, whilst cancer cells activate telomerase and encourage cell division. In 2018 Collins reported the most detailed image of the three-dimensional molecular structure of telemorase, which offered hope for the design of drugs that can prevent cancer and ageing. Collins developed a scalpel-free approach to tumour biopsies. Cancer cells shed DNA into blood, DNA that can reveal mutations within the tumours that might make them resistant to treatment. The Collins approach samples small sections of DNA or RNA found in the blood, which can provide information about the presence of a tumour. This type of sampling can also tell whether or not a cancer has metastasised or whether it will respond to certain therapies. In 2017 she decided to spin this technology out into a company; KarnaTeq.

Formed in Rio de Janeiro in 2001, their initial line-up comprised vocalist/guitarist Danilo Cutrim, bassist V√≠tor Isensee and drummer Bruno Tiz√©. By 2002, Tiz√© left the band and was replaced by Nicholas Christ, while Isensee switched his position with Rodrigo Costa to become second guitarist. Their first shows were frequently attended by the sons of then-Deputy (and future President) Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo and Carlos, who were personal friends of the bandmembers; Eduardo would later cameo in the music video for \\"Hist√≥ria de Ver√£o\\". They released in 2003 the demo album Das Pistas de Skate √†s Pistas de Dan√ßa, which was a significative underground hit, and in 2005 their official debut, Teoria Din√¢mica Gastativa, produced by Liminha, came out through Universal Music Group. Following the release of Polisenso (2008) and Alegria Compartilhada (2011), which counted with guest appearances by rapper Black Alien and big band Funk Como Le Gusta, the group reached further proeminence due to their nominations to the MTV Video Music Brazil award in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2012; in the 2005 edition, they performed a cover of Ultraje a Rigor's \\"N√≥s Vamos Invadir Sua Praia\\" alongside Leela, Ramirez and Dibob, with whom they would develop a strong friendship. In 2012 they collaborated on the song \\"Rio Porque T√¥ no Rio\\", described as an ode to Rio de Janeiro. In 2007 they collaborated on the eighth album by Santos-based band Charlie Brown Jr., Ritmo, Ritual e Responsa, co-writing and performing on the track \\"O Universo a Nosso Favor\\". The same year they took part in a show organized by MTV Brasil alongside NX Zero, Fresno, Hateen and Moptop; a live album of the performance would be released soon after. In 2013 they released the DVD Forfun ao Vivo no Circo Voador, recorded at a performance the year prior which counted with guest appearances by their friends from Dibob, Toni Garrido of Cidade Negra and Dead Fish vocalist Rodrigo Lima. Alongside the DVD they also released the extended play Solto, containing three studio tracks recorded as extras. Their final studio album, Nu, came out in 2014. The following year they announced they would be ceasing their activities; Rodrigo Costa would elaborate in a 2019 interview that the major reason of the band's end was that he was veering from their initial \\"left-wing ideals\\", causing a rift between them. In 2016, Cutrim, Isensee and Christ formed a new project, Braza, and alongside former members of Dibob and Ramirez Costa founded the group Tivoli.

O'Brien was then part of Sarah Purser's workshop An T√∫r Gloine, which was commissioned to produce eight windws for the chapel. Of these, O'Brien's \\"Saint John window\\" is considered the most successful. It is the only of the 19 stained glass windows in the chapel to portray a biblical narrative is usually considered the strongest of An T√∫r Gloine's windows for its craftsmanship and strength of imagery. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \\"Our Lord\\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T√∫r Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \\"beguiling narrative details\\" and \\"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\\". The window is divided into three registers, each containing pairs of medallions. The imagery mostly concerns the life of Christ as told ni the Gospel of John, and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on Revelations 1:1, and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show (on the left) St. Peter and John running towards Jesus' tomb, and (on the right) Jesus walking with Peter while St John follows behind. The crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. More characteristic of Protestant than Catholic iconography is the depiction of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet; the serpent probably refers to Genesis 3:15: \\"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\\" The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother James, \\"the disciple whom Jesus loved\\". The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; James and John are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and St. Andrew, who are already at Jesus' side. The eagle at the foot of the window is John's usual symbol.

It is a story of a \\"mad scientist\\", mathematician Ammon Lymphater, who invents an artificial intelligence, and then he realizes that it is capable of rendering the humankind obsolete. It was first published in the 1961 collection ' (Book of Robots) with the pre-annotation \\"from the memoirs of Ijon Tichy\\". The story was never republished with this pre- annotation, and nothing in the novel gives any indication at Ijon Tichy. Piotr Krywak tried to figure out possible explanations for this, apart from a typographical error.

He took note that the inherited knowledge is an evolutionary advantage somehow not exploited in full by the evolution. Eventually he came to a conclusion that only by pure biological restrictions that adaptive abilities of insects were stopped in their tracks by the evolution. He went on further wondering whether the ants have an ability to apriori knowledge, i.e., knowledge neither inherited nor learned. He decided to consult a famous myrmecologist, who told him about a rare ant species Acanthis Rubra Willinsoniana with an exceptionally high adaptability... Eventually Lymphater devised and constructed \\"It\\" capable of instant precognition of everything within \\"Its\\" rapidly expanding range of perception. From \\"It\\" Lymphater learns that the humanity is not the \\"crown of evolution\\", but rather evolution's tool to create \\"It\\", because the evolution could not create \\"It\\" directly (confirming Lymphater's reasoning about ants). Realizing that the Superentity \\"It\\" renders the human civilization redundant and obsolete, Lymphater destroys \\"It\\". \\"It\\" already knew Lymphater's intentions, but was not worried, knowing that sooner or later someone else will create \\"It\\" again and again. \\"It\\" was only the first variant of Lymphater's formula and the second variant is possible.

The fire, which started on August 10, 2020, has burned and is 82 percent contained as of September 3, 2020. The Grizzly Creek fire's proximity to Interstate 70 resulted in a 13-day closure of the interstate. It threatens the Shoshone Hydroelectric Generating Station and has resulted in the evacuation of residences in the area, as well as closure of recreational land in portions of White River National Forest. The fire was human caused with the exact cause under investigation.  Events  The Grizzly Creek Fire burning near the Shoshone Hydroelectric Generating Station. August The Grizzly Creek Fire, which was first called the 120 Fire, was first reported around 1:30 PM on August 10, burning in Glenwood Canyon one mile east of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Fueled by hot, dry, windy weather, the fire began spreading in multiple directions. Witnesses to the fire at its start included people rafting through the canyon and a Colorado Department of Transportation employee who tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher. Its growth towards Interstate 70 resulted in the interstate's closure from Glenwood Springs to Gypsum. By August 12, the fire had crossed both the interstate and the Colorado River. The power plant at the Shoshone Hydroelectric Generating Station was evacuated, alongside with the communities of No Name, Lookout Mountain, and Coulter Creek. The Glenwood Springs Community Center was named an evacuation point to connect evacuees with services and Battle Mountain High School was named an evacuation center. Local roads in the area were also closed, as well as portions of Bureau of Land Management-managed land and portions of White River National Forest. Air support was immediately brought in due to the fire's hard-to-reach location in the canyon. The fire grew rapidly with Red Flag winds and by the morning of August 13 it spread east towards Bair Ranch and southeast into Devil's Hole Canyon and doubled in size from to . It was one percent contained. Highway 82 was closed at Independence Pass due to excessive traffic and accidents resulting from drivers using rural, rugged dirt roads as alternatives to Interstate 70, which remained closed. The next day, on August 14, the Bureau of Land Management closed recreational sites and boat ramps around the southern part of the Colorado River near Dotsero. The fire spotted across Coffee Pot Rd. on August 15, with crews catching the spot fire before it could spread. The fire did continue towards Bair Ranch, with dozer lines being put in place to protect the core of the ranch. Air quality health advisories were put in place for areas east of the fire. Due to the fire's location near infrastructure, residences and its potential impact on the environment, Burned Area Emergency Response teams arrived early on the scene, on August 19. That same day, it was reported that the Shoshone Hydroelectric Power Plant's service was interrupted by downed transmission lines. On August 20, evacuation orders were downgraded for residents in the Buck Point area. The next day, containment was achieved from Coffee Pot Road to I-70. That same day, it was announced that Dan Gibbs, the head of Colorado's Department of Natural Resources and a wildland firefighter was fighting the fire near Glenwood Springs. I-70 was reopened the morning of August 24. Later that day, a flare up along the interstate resulted in a second, temporary closure while helicopter's quelled the flare up with water drops. By August 26, the fire was 61 percent contained at . Containment continued to grow and suppression work began in impacted areas, including on Coffee Pot Rd. On the afternoon of August 30, a storm generated wind gusts of 40 MPH, resulting in crews being pulled from fire lines. The fire was determined to be human caused, with further investigation required to determine specificities. September As of September 3, the fire is 82 percent contained and had burned . Impact The Grizzly Creek Fire has impacted infrastructure, transportation and recreational activities in the area, including in White River National Forest. Closures and evacuations The Grizzly Creek Fire burning along Interstate 70 on August 11, 2020. The Grizzly Creek Fire caused a section of I-70 between Glenwood Springs and Gypsum in Glenwood Canyon to be closed on August 10, 2020. It was reopened by CDOT the morning of August 24, 2020. Local roads were also closed in the area, including Highway 82 which passes over Independence Pass. The communities of No Name, Lookout Mountain and Coulter Creek were evacuated and the Glenwood Springs Community Center served as an evacuation point. Portions of White River National Forest were also closed, including Glenwood Canyon. A Union Pacific Railroad passenger and freight line was closed in the area after debris falling caused a rock pile to form on the tracks. Train travel resumed by August 22. Economic The closures and evacuations resulted in cancelations on hotel and resort rooms by visitors in Glenwood Springs, exasperating economic challenges from the covid-19 pandemic. Due to the closure of Interstate 70 and other roads, local businesses were unable to keep groceries, pet food and other items in stock, resulting in empty shelves. There were also fuel shortages in the area. Infrastructure The Shoshone hydroelectric power plant lost transmission lines, resulting in a service interruption. Environmental The Colorado River's clarity was impacted with sediment from burned areas being carried into the river from rain. It will take an estimated five to seven years for the river's clarity to return to normal. The increased sediment will impact fishing, rafting and will increase rock slides. The river will begin to dilute where it meets the Roaring River and sediment is expected to be found in Lake Powell. Investigation On August 12, the Eagle County Sheriff's Office stated that the likely cause of the Grizzly Creek Fire was \\"a popped tire, sparks from a rim or dragging chains.\\" On August 31, the US Forest Service confirmed that the fire was human caused and that further investigation was required to determine the specific cause.
