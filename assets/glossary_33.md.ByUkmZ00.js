It ranks among early works by the \\"Master of the Krumlov Madonna\\" and is exhibited on loan at the permanent collection of the National Gallery in Prague. Sv. Petr ze Slivice, N√°rodn√≠ galerie v Praze  Description and context  The sculpture dates from the period around 1395 and is 91.5 cm tall. It was carved out of golden Prague marlstone and bears traces of polychromy and gilding. The figure lacks its traditional attributes (such as keys), though the fact that it is St. Peter is shown by the typology of the face and the sculpture's original location in the Church of St. Peter. The figure is portrayed in counterpose, with a wealth of drapery that creates deep transverse hollows and vertical pleating, also obscuring the body's proportions. The naturalistic face of an old man and the details of the hands contrast with the hair and beard that are stylised in corkscrew-shaped curls. The individualisation of the face's expression follows on from tombstones by the Parler workshop, though in accordance with the trends of the International Gothic style its expression is more idealised and a sense of resignation is manifested in the posture of the figure.Kutal A, 1972, pp. 120-121 In terms of its type and, for example, the shape of its collar the sculpture has much in common with the figure of St. Bartholomew in the panel painting by a follower of the Master of the T≈ôebo≈à Altarpiece, the Madonna between SS Batholomew and Margaret (c. 1400).Kutal A, 1962, p. 88Matƒõjƒçek A, Pe≈°ina J, 1950, pp. 107-108 The sculpture of St. Peter represented Czech Gothic art at international exhibitions in Paris and Montreal. It is a typical example of the International Gothic style that is characterised by a tension between idealism and naturalism, and in which form gradually acquires as much meaning as symbolic content. This style has its origin in the Parler workshop at St Vitus Cathedral where corresponding signs can be found in the tombstones of Bohemian kings, in busts in the cathedral's triforium and the sculpture of St. Wenceslas that was probably carved by Heinrich IV. Parler. The most characteristic material of Prague sculpture production in the late 14th and early 15th century is marlstone, which was mined in quarries at White Mountain and in P≈ôedn√≠ Kopanina. For a short time after being quarried, marlstone retains its softness and moisture, enabling it to be worked in great detail with carving tools. On the basis of the analysis of material it is possible to determine the Prague origin of numerous sculptures exported from Bohemia to Silesia, Austria and the Rhineland. During the weak rule of Wenceslas IV, it was above all the Archbishop of Prague and leading noble families who commissioned these demanding works of art. Because of their stylised beauty, sculptures of the International Gothic style increasingly became a focus of criticism by church reformers in the period before the outbreak of the Hussite Wars and many fell victim to iconoclasm. = Related works = * Madonna of Plze≈à * Madona of Krumlov * Madona of Halstatt * Madona of ≈†ternberk * Moses console, Toru≈Ñ * Tombstones by Peter Parler, St. Vitus Cathedral * Adoration of the Magi, St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna  Notes  References  * Karl Heinz Clasen: Der Meister der Sch√∂nen Madonnen.

As Alexander II was the father of Constantine, and Constantine himself was married to a sister of Bektash, Bektash and Constantine were brother-in-laws as well as cousins at the same time. According to Professor Hirotake Maeda, this was part of king Abbas I (r. 1588‚Äì1629) intentions to make the Bagrationis and Qizilbash leaders related to each other by blood, and to incorporate them into Safavid elite society. A member of the \\"Torkman tribe\\", who traditionally held the governorship of Tabriz, Bektash was sent to Kakheti by Abbas I together with Prince Constantine and fellow Torkman tribesmen in 1604-1605. In the ensuing period in Kakheti, Constatine killed his own father Alexander II and Prince Giorgi and controlled Kakheti for a period, but the Georgians soon revolted and Constantine was killed as a result. Ten years later, when the shah himself led a punitive expedition to Georgia by which Safavid Iranian rule over eastern Georgia (Kartli, Kakheti) would be decisively cemented, Bektash was officially appointed as the first Qizilbash governor of Kakheti. In 1615, during the revolt in Georgia against the Safavid rule, Bektash was killed.

The major schools of thought include the overarching idea that Virgil had written a story that parallels Roman history at the time it was written as well as messages both in support of and against the rule of Augustus Caesar. Finally, it has been argued that Virgil had a stance on geopolitics which he conveys in the actions of Aeneas and his crew.  Parallels with Roman history  It has been claimed that Virgil wrote the Aeneid to reflect the Roman political stance of his time. Virgil does this primarily by splitting the story into two parts. The first half shows an obsession with the fall of Troy, together with failed attempts to establish cities during Aeneas' wanderings; while the second half depicts victory in battle and the establishment of a new Troy at Rome. This mirrors Rome's disestablishment of the republic after the strife of a civil war, and the establishment of peace and prosperity with the new Roman Empire. These reflect Augustan propaganda which asks that his people not forget the repetition of the past of civil war but remember and repeat it in order to conquer their problems in support of his new reign of the empire.  Positive images of Augustus Caesar's rule  The Aeneid was written during a period of political unrest in Rome. The Roman republic had effectively been abolished, and Octavian (Augustus Caesar) had taken over as the leader of the new Roman empire. The Aeneid was written to praise Augustus by drawing parallels between him and the protagonist, Aeneas. Virgil does so by mirroring Caesar with Aeneas and by creating a direct lineage between Aeneas and Augustus. Aeneas is the founder of the new city of Rome, while Octavian, as the first Roman emperor, founded a new and improved Rome. Specifically, Aeneas seeks to establish a new nation based on that of Italy and Troy, just as Augustus sought to create a new Rome based on Rome's older traditions. These parallels, combined with Aeneas' portrayal as a strong and powerful leader, establish his means of promoting Augustus as a great leader. Virgil creates a common ancestry between Aeneas and Augustus by interacting with the Roman tradition of viewing Romulus as the founder of Rome. Romulus is known as the son of Mars and a vestal virgin. According to the historian Livy, this vestal virgin's name was Rhea Silvia, who is described in Book I of the Aeneid as a descendant of Aeneas. Virgil establishes a stronger connection of Silvia to the Trojans by changing her name in the epic to Ilia. This new name connects her by its similarity to the name \\"Ilium\\", another name for the city of Troy, and because it is the feminine form of both Ilus (Aeneas' great-great-grandfather) and Ilus, the second name of Ascanius before the fall of Troy. Virgil also references Julius Caesar's claim to divine ancestry as a descendant of Venus and Anchises, supporting this claim in his text. In a speech by Jupiter, he references a \\"Trojan Caesar\\" as a descendant of Ascanius (by the name of Iulus) and therefore of Venus: > \\"from this noble line shall be born the Trojan Caesar... a Julius, name > descended from great lulus!\\" This text also reminds the audience of the bloodline shared between Aeneas and Augustus. In Book VI, when Aeneas is in Elysium, his father describes descendants who will one day inherit their name. He describes Aeneas' children, followed by Romulus, then skips ahead to Augustus Caesar. This creates the illusion of a direct connection between Caesar and Romulus.  Warning against Caesar's rule  Within the context of the Aeneid there are also warnings against the new political regime. Virgil questions whether the new political foundation promised by Caesar will actually be an escape from the repetitions of the civil war. Caesar claims that good repetition can replace the bad, but Virgil asks in his epic whether repetition can be a good thing at all. This is shown when Anchises misreads the oracle of Delos, leading to the failure of the settlement on Crete. This is intended to indicate how an obsession with the former Troy interferes with the goal of establishing a new one, thus representing the failure in a focus on the past. When Anchises interprets the Delian oracle he states that the Trojan Ida got her name from the Cretan mountain. The repetition of \\"Idaeus/idaeumque\\" reflects their attempts to repeat the past by finding likeness in new land. This repetition suggests their desire for the familiar rather than willingness to confront something new. This is parallel to Caesar's claim of good repetition replacing the bad.  Geopolitics  Virgil also wishes to express his concerns for the geopolitics of Rome. He does so by depicting a war against nature by Aeneas and his men. There are several examples of this, starting early in the epic when Aeneas has to kill seven stags, which is notable as one of the first events in the story. Other occurrences of Aeneas and his men waging war against nature include: * After arriving in Thrace, Aeneas pulls out seven trees, first making the roots bleed, then eliciting a pitiful groan on the last pull. * The Trojans come across goats and cattle which they kill not for sacrifice but as hunters. * When the crew arrives in Cumae, they damage nature by taking prey and chopping down trees. * In Book IX, the Trojans cut down the primeval forests in order to build the altar for Misenus' tomb. * Tarchon establishes a view of nature as hostile and something to overcome by referring to the land as hostile in Book X. Upon the first sight of Italy, Virgil repeatedly refers to the natural wealth of the land, writing about the great soil and the Tiber River. This is accompanied by much destruction of that land by the Trojans as depicted by the use of nature for strategy in Book XI, and the destruction of the trees by Aeneas and his men late in Book XII. In Virgil's most significant display of war against nature, the Trojans cut down a sacred olive tree in preparation of an open battlefield. This sacred tree represents a focus on preservation of nature, and is therefore in opposition to the political values of the contemporary Roman Empire. This violence opens a commentary on the establishment of the Empire based on destruction. It mirrors the chaos of the Italian countryside during Virgil's time. Through the events of the Aeneid, Virgil hopes to reveal the consequences of Aeneas' mission as the destruction of Italy's natural environment.

St. Vitus Madonna, National Gallery in Prague  History of the picture  Jan of Jen≈°tejn, chancellor of King Wenceslaus IV and the Archbishop of Prague, was usually quoted as the donor of this picture. It is more likely, however, that the picture was painted later on, meaning that a more probable donor was Old≈ôich Zaj√≠c of Hazmburk, brother of Zbynƒõk Zaj√≠c of Hazmburk, fifth Archbishop of Prague, who died in 1411. In memory of his brother, Old≈ôich Zaj√≠c of Hazmburk founded the altarpiece of St. Johns in their family chapel at St Vitus Cathedral.Fajt J, Chlumsk√° ≈†, 2014, p. 54 The picture itself survived separately in the possession of the Metropolitan Chapter. The picture‚Äôs frame was purchased in 1883 from the estate of Josef Vojtƒõch Hellich for the Prague City Museum, from where it came to gallery of the Society of Patriotic Friends of Art. In 1937 Vincenc Kram√°≈ô, director of the Society, joined both parts and since 1940 the picture and its frame have been loaned for display at the National Gallery in Prague. Information from the St. Vitus inventory of the late 15th century mentions a beautiful panel of the Virgin Mary with the portraits of the four Evangelists and four patron saints of the Czech lands. It is recorded that they were painted by ‚ÄòPrague bachelors‚Äô (Prague young men) ‚Äì free artists who appear in written sources from the 15th century.Krameriuus: O Junkerech pra≈æsk√Ωch The St Vitus Madonna was exhibited in New York City in 2005.The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY: Prague The Crown of Bohemia, 1347‚Äì1437  Description and context  The picture in a cut frame decorated with twelve portraits is painted in tempera on a chalk base, on a soft-wood panel covered with stretched canvas. It is 51 x 39.5 cm in size. In the 1850s amethysts donated by Canon Pe≈°ina were added to the halo (these were later removed). The composition as a whole adheres to older models of Marian pictures. The picture of the St Vitus Madonna is directly related to sculptures in the International Gothic style and demonstrates how painting could have been directly influenced by contemporary sculpture.Matƒõjƒçek A, Pe≈°ina J, 1950, p. 117 Stylistically it corresponds to artistic development in Bohemia around 1400 and, with its perfection of form, became the prototype of the Beautiful Madonnas. The medallions with portraits in low detailed reliefs, that decorate the frame, depict half-figures of four patron saints of the Czech lands: St. Wenceslaus, St. Sigisgmund, St. Vitus and St. Adalbert (vertically); John the Baptist and John the Evangelist (top) and St. Procopius (?) and a kneeling archbishop, possibly the donor Jan of Jen≈°tejn or the deceased Zbynƒõk Zaj√≠c of Hazmburk (bottom). In the corners of the frame there are four quadrilobes with figures of angels bearing ribbons on which there are fragments of the text of the popular 12th-century Marian antiphon Regina coeli, laetare in which the faithful looked for protection against the plaque. Gemstones are indicated between the portraits; these were usually part of works meant for worshipping. The picture originally stood on the altar independently, since on its reverse it was decorated with silver foil. This work dates from the high period of the Marian cult around 1400. It represents one of the two main types ‚Äì the Madonna holding the child on her right side and both figures directing their gaze towards the viewer. Jesus‚Äôs mortal human origin is emphasised by his nudity and several details (such as his mother pressing her fingers into his skin). These details also have Eucharistic significance, referring to Corpus Christi. This concept of the Marian image was widespread in the period before the Hussite Wars broke out. = Related works = * Madonna of Ln√°≈ôe (1400-1420)Bishopric of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice: Madona Ln√°≈ôsk√° * The T√Ωn Madonna * The Madonna of Svoj≈°√≠n,Rodon: Madona svoj≈°√≠nsk√° differing in detail, since it has a crown as the Queen of Heaven, instead of a veil * The Madonna of Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec (a small format for private worship, not to be confused with the Madonna of Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec (1460)Madona z Jind≈ôichova Hradce * Illumination in the missal of Zbynƒõk Zaj√≠c of Hazmburk (1409)  Notes  References  * Fajt Ji≈ô√≠, Chlumsk√° ≈†√°rka, ƒåechy a st≈ôedn√≠ Evropa 1220-1550, N√°rodn√≠ galerie v Praze 2014, , p. 53-57 * Robert Suckale, Matthias Weiger, Ingo F.

The SulP family is a large and ubiquitous family of proteins derived from archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. Many organisms including Bacillus subtilis, Synechocystis sp, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans possess multiple SulP family paralogues. Many of these proteins are functionally characterized, and most are inorganic anion uptake transporters or anion:anion exchange transporters. Some transport their substrate(s) with high affinities, while others transport it or them with relatively low affinities. Others may catalyze SO:HCO exchange, or more generally, anion:anion antiport. For example, the mouse homologue, SLC26A6 (TC# 2.A.53.2.7), can transport sulfate, formate, oxalate, chloride and bicarbonate, exchanging any one of these anions for another. A cyanobacterial homologue can transport nitrate. Some members can function as channels. SLC26A3 (2.A.53.2.3) and SLC26A6 (2.A.53.2.7 and 2.A.53.2.8) can function as carriers or channels, depending on the transported anion. In these porters, mutating a glutamate, also involved in transport in the CIC family (TC# 2.A.49), (E357A in SLC26A6) created a channel out of the carrier. It also changed the stoichiometry from 2Cl‚àí/HCO to 1Cl‚àí/HCO.  Structure  All SulPs are homodimers. where two subunits do not function independently. The dimeric structure probably represents the native state of SulP transporters. A low-resolution structure of a bacterial SulP transporter revealed a dimeric stoichiometry, stabilized via its transmembrane core and mobile intracellular domains. The cytoplasmic STAS domain projects away from the transmembrane domain and is not involved in dimerization. The structure suggests that large movements of the STAS domain underlie the conformational changes that occur during transport. The bacterial proteins vary in size from 434 residues to 573 residues with only a few exceptions. The eukaryotic proteins vary in size from 611 residues to 893 residues with a few exceptions. Thus, the eukaryotic proteins are usually larger than the prokaryotic homologues. These proteins exhibit 10-13 putative transmembrane Œ±-helical spanners (TMSs) depending on the protein. =Crystal structures= Several crystal structures are available for members of the SulP family through RCSB: :, , , Homologues One of the distant SulP homologues has been shown to be a bicarbonate:Na+ symporter (TC# 2.A.53.5.1). Bioinformatic work has identified additional homologues with fused domains. Some of these fused proteins have SulP homologues fused to carbonic anhydrase homologues (TC# 2.A.53.8.1). These are also presumed to be bicarbonate uptake permeases. Another has SulP fused to Rhodanese, a sulfate:cyanide sulfotransferase (TC# 2.A.53.9.1). This SulP homologue is presumably a sulfate transporter. Homologues currently characterized in the SulP family can be found in the Transporter Classification Database. =SLC26A3 in mice= One member of the SulP family, SLC26A3, has been knocked out in mice. Apical membrane chloride/base exchange activity was sharply reduced, and the luminal content was more acidic in SLC26A3-null mouse colon. The epithelial cells in the colon displayed unique adaptive regulation of ion transporters; NHE3 expression was enhanced in the proximal and distal colon, whereas colonic H+/K+-ATPase and the epithelial sodium channel showed massive up-regulation in the distal colon. Plasma aldosterone was increased in SLC26A3-null mice. Thus, SLC26A3 may be the major apical chloride/base exchanger and is essential for the absorption of chloride in the colon. In addition, SLC26A3 regulates colonic crypt proliferation. Deletion of SLC26A3 results in chloride-rich diarrhea and is associated with compensatory adaptive up-regulation of ion-absorbing transporters. =MOT1= MOT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (TC# 2.A.53.11.1, 456aas; 8-10 TMSs), a distant homologue of the SulP and BenE (2.A.46) families, is expressed in both roots and shoots, and is localized to plasma membranes and intracellular vesicles. MOT1 is required for efficient uptake and translocation of molybdate as well as for normal growth under conditions of limited molybdate supply. Kinetic studies in yeast revealed that the K(m) value of MOT1 for molybdate is approximately 20 nM. Mo uptake by MOT1 in yeast is not affected by the presence of sulfate. MOT1 did not complement a sulfate transporter-deficient yeast mutant strain. MOT1 is thus probably specific for molybdate. The high affinity of MOT1 allows plants to obtain scarce Mo from soil when its concentration is about 10nM. =SLC26= SLC26 proteins function as anion exchangers and Cl‚àí channels. Ousingsawat et al. (2012) examined the functional interaction between CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and SLC26A9 in polarized airway epithelial cells and in non-polarized HEK293 cells expressing CFTR and SLC26A9 (2.A.56.2.10). They found that SLC26A9 provides a constitutively active basal Cl‚àí conductance in polarized grown CFTR-expressing CFBE airway epithelial cells, but not in cells expressing F508del-CFTR. In polarized CFTR-expressing cells, SLC26A9 also contributes to both Ca2+\\\\- and CFTR-activated Cl‚àí secretion. In contrast in non-polarized HEK293 cells co-expressing CFTR/SLC26A9, the baseline Cl‚àí conductance provided by SLC26A9 was inhibited during activation of CFTR. Thus, SLC26A9 and CFTR behave differentially in polarized and non-polarized cells, explaining earlier conflicting data. Transport Reaction The generalized transport reactions catalyzed by SulP family proteins are: :(1) SO (out) + nH+ (out) ‚Üí SO (in) + nH+ (in). :(2) SO (out) + nHCO (in) ‚áå SO (in) + nHCO (out). :(3) I‚àí and other anions (out) ‚áå I‚àí and other anions (in). :(4) HCO (out) + nH+ (out) ‚Üí HCO (in) + nH+ (in).

Description and context  The picture is painted in tempera on a lime-wood panel covered with canvas and a chalk base with an engraved drawing. It is 90 x 68 cm, including the original frame. In the 18th century the entire picture was painted over and an opening for a relic was carved out in the place where the Madonna's gold clasp had originally been.

Prior to this date, Madeiran law dictated that the mortal remains of those deceased who were not Roman Catholic by faith were to be buried at sea, thrown from the cliffs at Garajau; later, a statue of Christ, called Cristo Rei, was erected in remembrance of this. However, from 1772 onward, British interests in Madeira secured a burial ground, called the Nation¬¥s Burial Ground, close to the original city walls of Funchal. The site of this earlier cemetery is taken up by a small public square and car showrooms today.

Design and development The Rubis was the outcome of design studies of a low power, two seat aircraft intended to be used as a trainer and capable of modest touring trips. Stability was preferred over performance; robustness was also required. Les Ailes referred to it as an avion de promenade. The studies pointed to a parasol wing aircraft with the characteristics of a medium performance glider As a result, the Rubis had a relatively long span, cantilever, five part wing with a short central section, long, sharply tapering outer panels and easily detachable wingtips to protect the wings against ground contact shocks. The aspect ratio was 10 and there was no dihedral. Structurally the wing was all metal, built mostly from duralumin tubes and with two principal spars which converged in the outer panels to almost meet at their tips. The inner section had parallel spars, though the ribs there were joined by additional, diagonal members to strengthen the region for the leading edge mounted engine and the various struts which attached the wing to the fuselage. The wing was fabric covered except around the leading and trailing edges, which were metal skinned. It had narrow, span ailerons. The fuselage proper was formed by two parallel, uncovered flat girder frames apart, each with two long, light alloy primary members. In flight the upper members, with the wings upon them, were horizontal. At its forward end each girder frame had a vertical cross-brace between the upper and lower members. The lower one sloped upward aft, where three diagonal struts braced the girders; wire cross-bracing stabilised the girders into a beam. At the rear the empennage was conventional, with a parallel chord tailplane mounted on top of the upper fuselage members, a one piece, straight edged elevator hinged on it. There was a single, central fin which blended into a rhombohedral rudder; its cut-away underside provided for elevator movement. The Rubis had a tube-framed, streamlined pod, containing a pair of side-by- seats in an oval, open cockpit which extended just aft of the trailing edge. The pod also formed an integral part of the undercarriage structure. On each side, a main undercarriage leg sloped inwards from the wheel hub to the upper end of the fuselage frame; the hub was at the vertex of a V-strut attached to the pod frame. The upper pod frame was braced to the fuselage frames with a pair of transverse V-struts, one ahead and one aft of the cockpit. A long tailskid, which reached out to the rear end of the pod, was fixed to the central lower pod frame. The Rubis was powered by a nine cylinder Salmson 9AD radial engine mounted centrally with its thrust line just above the wing. Its cylinders were exposed for cooling but there was a long, semi-teardrop fairing behind it to smooth the airflow over the wing's upper surface. Fuel and oil tanks were in the wing centre section. The exact date of the first flight of the Rubis is not known but the initial development tests were complete by March 1933. There are no further references to it in the French contemporary digitised records of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF).

He was also a Hindu nationalist activist and a politician of the Hindu Mahasabha, who was arrested for inflaming passions among Hindus against Mahatma Gandhi, leading to his assassination. Nath played a leading role in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in 1949, which culminated in the placing of Rama idols inside the Babri Masjid, in an effort to revive the Hindu Mahasabha after its implication in the Gandhi assassination. Nath was elected as the MP for Gorakhpur in 1967 on a Hindu Mahasabha ticket.  Early life  Digvijay Nath was born Swaroop 'Nanhu' Singh in 1894 in Kankarwa Thikana of Mewar, Udaipur, Rajasthan in a Rajput thakur family. His mother died when he was 8 years old. His father was Rawat Uday Singhji of Kankarwa, President of the Mewar Presidency Council (Mahendraj Sabha). He was given away or taken away to a Nathpanth yogi called Phul Nath, who took him to the Gorakhnath Math (monastery) in Gorakhpur. Nanhu Singh grew up in the monastery and went to study in the St. Andrews College in Gorakhpur. He was an average student but excelled in sports, especially, hockey, horse- riding and tennis. In 1920, he left his education to take part in politics. In 1932, Baba Brahma Nath became the mahant of the Gorakhnath Math and initiated Nanhu Singh into the Nath panth tradition. After his death in 1935, the leadership of the math passed to Digvijay Nath, who was anointed as the mahant on 15 August 1935. Despite being a mahant, Nath continued his pastime of playing lawn tennis as well as his political activities. The Gorakhnath math was traditionally venerated by both Hindus and Muslims, especially lower caste communities. Religious career Digvijay Nath was succeeded by Mahant Avaidyanath as the head of Gorakhnath Math in 1969.  Political career  Digvijay Nath joined the Congress in 1920, and participated in the non- cooperation movement in 1922. He was arrested for taking an \\"active part\\" in the Chauri Chaura incident where a police station was burnt down, killing 23 policemen, causing Mahatma Gandhi to abort the movement. Nath joined the Hindu Mahasabha in 1937 when V. D. Savarkar became its President, and rose to become the head of the party in the United Provinces. His status as the mahant of the Gorakhpur Math as well as his political acumen helped him rise fast. He was radically anti-Muslim. He told The Statesman in 1952 that, if the Hindu Mahasabha attained power, it would deprive the Muslims of the right to vote for five to ten years, until they proved \\"their loyalty to India.\\" He incited Hindus to kill Mahatma Gandhi in a public meeting on 27 January 1948, three days before the actual assassination. He was subsequently arrested, along with Professor Ram Singh and V. G. Deshpande, but released after 9 months. Soon after his release from prison, Digvijay Nath started making plans to revive the Hindu Mahasabha, which had invited the public's revulsion for its role in the assassination of Gandhi. The capture of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was a key plank of his plan. He was elected to Lok Sabha in 1967 General election from Gorakhpur. He died mid-term in 1969.

He has been studying and practicing Chinese painting, Western painting and Chinese calligraphy since age fourteen. During 30 years of artistic exploration, his style blended the traditional framework of Chinese ink color painting with western techniques. He applies rich, vibrant colors to form layered images that are both abstract and concrete. Lam was twice invited by the Chinese Ministry of Culture to paint on the theme of Hong Kong views. The paintings, ‚ÄùMorning Songs‚Äù and ‚ÄúSideview in Victoria Harbour‚Äù, accompanied the space journeys of Shenzhou VI and Shenzhou VII in 2005 and 2008 respectively. Since the late 1990s Lam has created a series of works on the theme of Hong Kong scenery and landscapes. He travelled to Tibet three times, risking his life, and created his ‚ÄúTibet in Tian Xing‚Äù series. His series ‚ÄúLotus in Tian Xing‚Äù uniquely marked his personal artistic development. His paintings are well received by public and private collectors alike, both local and overseas.  Early life  Lam was born in October 1963 in Fujian Province, China. He began studying Western and Chinese paintings in 1978 under the guidance of masters such as Wu Gouguang, Lin Guang, Chen Ting and Liu Mu. He immigrated to Hong Kong in 1984.

The name of the sculpture, brought from Brno in 1856,Hrabovsk√°, 2008, p. 44 relates to its non-original location in the parish church in Michle from where it was purchased by the National Gallery in Prague. Michle Madonna, National Gallery in Prague  Description and context  The sculpture of the Michle Madonna is 120 cm tall and is carved from pear wood. It bears traces of polychromy. It is the most important example of the linear-rhythmic style of carving, dating from the second quarter of the 14th century in the Czech lands. This style is characterised by drapery that clings to a cylindrical torso in low, sagging pleats that have a decorative and finely drawn character, as does the linen cloth and locks of hair. The legs of the figure of the Madonna in contrapose are clearly distinguished between the standing and loose one. The child is resting on the Madonna's jutting right side, towards which both the vertical and horizontal folds of the clothes converge, thus emphasising the bond between the mother and child. The lower position of the child enables the mother's head to bow more, thereby making the sculptural composition more enclosed. The Infant Jesus‚Äôs hands have not survived but it is clear that he is making a blessing, and is thus not turned towards his mother but towards the faithful.Hrabovsk√°, 2008, pp. 18-19 The Michle Madonna‚Äôs formal conception has much in common with the linear style of French stone sculpture of the first third of the 14th century (such as the sculpture of five apostles from the Church of St Jacques-aux-P√®lerins and the tomb sculptures of French kings at St Denis)Homolka, 2005, pp. 297-298 that could have been mediated to the Czech context through the Rhineland. Sculptures of this style are typified by stylisation of shapes and a dense schematic linear pleating of the drapery in both standing and reclining figures. The objective details and wealth of decoration, precisely observed and reproduced, are striking. The group of wooden sculptures related to the Michle Madonna were also originally covered with polychromy, gilding and embossing. The distinct abstracting style of the workshop of the \\"Master of the Michle Madonna\\" gradually absorbed the impulses of contemporary panel painting that was oriented more towards Italian models ‚Äì the head of the Michle Madonna bears a striking resemblance to the \\"Madonna of Veve≈ô√≠\\". It was characterised by a greater emphasis on the physical volume of the figures and the realistic depiction of details. The workshop also produced other Moravian Madonnas (such as the \\"Madonna of Velk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠\\", the small \\"Apostle of Veversk√° Bit√Ω≈°ka\\", the \\"Znojmo Madonna\\" and the \\"Prostƒõjov Madonna\\"). Late works ascribed to the workshop of the \\"Master of the Michle Madonna\\" prefigured the abandoning of linear formalism that was accompanied by the effort to achieve specific form and greater naturalism.

Although the Yunhai jingyuan is a lost work, several later dictionaries, such as the (1711) Peiwen Yunfu, followed its system of collating entries by the tone and rime of the last character in a term.

By any standards, it was a very large dictionary, and \\"by the standards of the time it must have been simply gigantic\\" (Needham and Harbsmeier 1998: 78). For more than two centuries, the Yunhai jingyuan remained the most inclusive Chinese dictionary, until the (1039) Jiyun with 53,525 character entries. Compared with two contemporary 100-volume dictionaries, the Guiyuan zhucong Ê°ÇËãëÁè†Âè¢ by Zhuge Ying Ë´∏ËëõÊΩÅ (539-615) and the 100-volume Zihai Â≠óÊµ∑ compiled under the direction of Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690-705), the Yunhai jingyuan was an \\"even more miraculous lexicographical work\\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 178). Chinese dictionaries are traditionally dichotomized between z√¨di«én Â≠óÂÖ∏ \\"character dictionaries\\" and c√≠di«én Ëæ≠ÂÖ∏ \\"word dictionaries\\". In the history of Chinese lexicography, the Yunhai jingyuan was the earliest hybrid of a word dictionary and a rime dictionary (Yong and Peng 2008: 226). Earlier rime dictionaries that only included characters include (c. 230) Shenglei and the (601) Qieyun, which was revised as the (720) Tangyun ÂîêÈüª. In 773, during the reign of Emperor Daizong of Tang (r. 762-779). Yan Zhengqing assembled a group of over 50 scholars with diverse backgrounds to compile the Yunhai jingyuan at his residence in Huzhou. They included several of his literary friends, the Daoist poet Zhang Zhihe, the Chan Buddhist monk Jiaoran ÁöéÁÑ∂, and Lu Yu, author of The Classic of Tea (Benn 2015: 108). In the same year, the Yunhailou ÈüªÊµ∑Ê®ì \\"Ocean of Rhymes Building\\" was constructed as the depository for its namesake Yunhai jingyuan. The building was restored in 1666, and is presently a municipal library and cultural center in Huzhou, Zhejiang prefecture. Yan Zhengqing's reference work included not only single-syllable words but also multi- character compounds, and even some chengyu \\"set phrases\\". This type of specialized dictionary was intended for the composition of poems, retrieving literary quotations, and finding appropriate words for antithetical couplets (Yong and Peng 2008: 330). The word or phrase entries in the Yunhai jingyuan were phonologically arranged by the 106 rime groups of the Pingshui (lit. Âπ≥Ê∞¥ \\"level water\\") system, which is based on the traditional four tones: ping \\"level\\", shang \\"rising\\", qu \\"departing\\", and ru \\"entering\\". Note that the term rime is used, as opposed to common rhyme, in the linguistic sense of syllable rime or Chinese rime table. A dictionary user looks up a word by the tone and rime of the final character, which presumes that the user already knows, or can guess, how to pronounce the character. For speakers of alphabetic languages who are familiar with easy dictionary lookup, using a Chinese dictionary based on the Yunhai jingyuan system is very user-unfriendly. Three later dictionaries of literary allusions followed the 106-rime arrangement of the Yunhai jingyuan. First were the Yuan dynasty (c. 1280) Yunfu qunyu ÈüªÂ∫úÁæ§Áéâ \\"Assembly of Jade Tablets, a Word-Store arranged by Rhymes\\" compiled by Yin Shifu Èô∞ÊôÇÂ§´ and the Ming dynasty (1592) Wuche yunrui ‰∫îËªäÈüªÁëû \\"Five Cartloads of Rhyme-inscribed Jade Tablets\\" by Ling Zhilong Ê∑©Á®öÈöÜ. Ultimately the Qing dynasty (1711) Peiwen yunfu \\"Word-store arranged by Rhymes, from the Hall of the Admiration of Literature\\" expanded entries and corrected errors in previous rime dictionaries, resulting in 212 volumes with 10,257 head entries arranged by the 106 Pingshui rime categories (tr. Needham et al. 1986: 219; Yong and Peng 2008: 330). The (1728) Pianzi leipian Èß¢Â≠óÈ°ûÁ∑® \\"Classified Collection of Phrases and Literary Allusions\\" dictionary was the first dictionary to abandon the traditional Yunhai jingyuan system of indexing words by their last character's rime and tone, and it indexed words by their first character (Needham et al. 1986: 219). Most subsequent Chinese word dictionaries were internally arranged by the graphic radical of the first character in a word. See also *Rime dictionary *Rime table References *Benn, James A.

It was created before 1380 and is on permanent display at the National Gallery in Prague Madonna of Zahra≈æany, National Gallery in Prague  Description and context  The 84 cm tall sculpture is made of lime wood, with traces of the original polychromy. The strikingly S-shaped figure of the Madonna holds the Infant Jesus in her right arm. Putting his finger to his lips, Jesus symbolises the nuns‚Äô vow of silence. The Virgin Mary's garments fit closely around her body, accentuating its natural movement and, on the right-hand side, compositionally balancing the figure of the child. The drapery is elaborated into an intricate system of folds and combines transverse deep hollows and the complex pleating of the merging bottom edges of her clothes. The use of perspectival shortening and the downward views of both Mary and the Infant Jesus indicate that the sculpture was originally located on a high console or in the uppermost part of an altar. The Madonna of Zahra≈æany is related to several wooden Enthroned Madonnas of the 1370s (such as those from Hr√°dek and Konopi≈°tƒõ) and also to the stone sculpture of the \\"Madonna of the Old Town Hall\\" in Prague (1380) and the triforium bust of Blanche of Valois that were made by the St. Vitus Cathedral workshop. A figural type that corresponds with the Madonna of Zahra≈æany appears in book painting (\\"The Gospel Book of Jan of Opava\\", 1368).Kutal A, 1970 p. 133 The compositional scheme has a forerunner in the \\"Liber viaticus\\" (1354‚Äì64) and is repeated in a number of murals (Karl≈°tejn, the Emmaus monastery) as well as in the figure of St Catherine in a panel painting from the Cistercian monastery in Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod (Madonna between St Catherine and St Margaret, c. 1360).Mudra A, 2004, p. 415 The Madonna of Zahra≈æany is exceptional high-quality and stylistically well-defined carving that, in the context of Central European sculpture of the third quarter of the 14th century, has no parallel in other workshop pieces.

It stars Haley Lu Richardson, Booboo Stewart, Nicole Fox, Jacqueline Emerson, Max Charles, Michael Welch and Rena Owen THE LAST SURVIVORS: Check Out An Exclusive Clip From Tom Hammock's Post-Apocalyptic Film by Todd Brown; July 31, 2015 Set in Oregon, the film centers around a dystopian world with a shortage of water.  Plot  Ten years after rain ceases to fall, this setting in Oregon has turned into a dry wasteland. Survivors spend their time desperately trying to locate enough water to stay alive and avoiding hostile scavengers. Kendal takes care of fellow orphan Dean, who is near death from kidney failure. Her friend Gabriel, who lives on a nearby farm, urges her to join him, but she refuses to abandon Dean. One day, after hearing a cry for help on their two-way radio, Kendal leaves to assist the caller. She finds that it is a trap to ensnare the family's neighbors. Kendal hides as marauders kill off the remaining family members, unable to save them, then sneaks back to her house in the dark. As the local wells go dry, Dean theorizes that a local warlord, Carson, has drilled to the aquifer and is draining everyone's water supply. Carson owns a small compound that he advertises as a safe haven. Kendal's neighbor Grace, after her well goes dry, tells Kendal that she has accepted Carson's offer to join him. Grace urges Kendal to accompany her and Gabriel, as she believes Carson has medicine that can help Dean. Kendal remains skeptical and hides when Carson arrives. Carson abruptly kills Gabriel's entire family, saying that everyone but Gabriel is either too old or infirm to save based on the limited amount of water available. Though horrified, Gabriel reluctantly agrees and turns in a relative who was also hiding. Kendal escapes after killing a sentry. Kendal checks on Alby, a young boy who lives on his own. She tells him of Dean's plan to escape via a Cessna that has been almost fully repaired; all they need is the proper distributor cap. However, Alby says he is better able to survive on his own and asks her not to visit him so often, as it attracts Carson's attention. After finally recovering the proper distributor cap from a car in Carson's compound, Kendal returns home again, only to find that three survivors have wandered onto their property in search of water. Dean convinces Kendal to donate water to them, though Kendal remains suspicious of their intentions. When they return shortly afterward, her suspicions are confirmed as they seek to steal the remaining water. Dean, barely able to walk, shoots them before they can kill Kendal. Drawn by the sound of gunshots as he surveys the local farms, Carson investigates. Dean kills several of Carson's men before they kill him. After killing one of his men, who has become wounded and thus a liability, Carson expresses regret that he is not able to save more of the survivors. His lieutenant, a man in priest's garb, reassures him that what they do is for the greater good. Kendal once again escapes after hiding from Carson's men and retrieves a katana from one the graves at Grace's farm. Now armed, she returns to the house and kills the men left behind to search it, including the priest and Gabriel, whose identity was obscured by a mask. When Kendal checks on Alby to invite him to escape with her on the Cessna, she discovers Carson has abducted him. She attacks Carson's compound and kills all his henchmen. When only Kendal, Carson, his daughter, and Alby remain, Carson attacks Kendal, who kills him with the katana. Brooke, Carson's daughter, nearly defeats Kendal by putting her in a choke hold. Kendal breaks free just before passing out and stabs Brooke with the sword. She and Alby go to the Cessna and, after inserting the distributor cap, start it up. As they board the plane, Alby asks about Dean, and Kendal says that he is staying behind.

It is a sticky, glabrous, rounded shrub with narrow leaves and white to lilac-coloured flowers and which occurs in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Description Eremophila gibsonii is an erect, rounded shrub usually growing to a height of between and which is glabrous, sticky and shiny due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately and scattered along the branches, linear in shape, mostly long, wide, have a hooked end, a rough surface and usually pointed teeth on the margins. The flowers are borne singly or in groups of up to 3 in leaf axils on a stalk long. There are 5 overlapping shiny, sticky, hairy green sepals which differ from each other in size and shape, varying from egg-shaped to lance shaped, mostly long, but enlarging after flowering. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white to pale lilac- coloured and covered on the outside with mostly glandular hairs. The inside surface of the petal lobes is glabrous but the inside of the tube is densely filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from August to October and is followed by fruits which are woody with a hairy, papery covering, oval shaped and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1874 by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (gibsonii) honours Alfred Gibson who died on the Ernest Giles expedition in 1874 and after whom the Gibson Desert is named. Distribution and habitat In Western Australia, Eremophila gibsonii grows in the western part of the state in the Central Ranges, Great Victoria Desert and Murchison biogeographic regions. In South Australia it is found in the North-Western, Nullarbor and Gairdner-Torrens botanical regions. It also grows in the far south-western corner of the Northern Territory. It is a common shrub found on sand dunes in central Australia. Conservation Eremophila gibsonii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila has wispy foliage and delicate white to pale blue flowers. It can be propagated from cuttings but in this case needs to be grown in deep sand. The grafted form performs well in a range of soils but requires full sun. Mature specimens are drought and frost tolerant.

Bishop was a barber and civil rights activist in Washington, D.C. His work for equal schools for black and white children in the 1940s and 1950s included organizing the student strike at Browne Junior High School and contributing to the historic Bolling v. Sharpe case that made school segregation unconstitutional in the District. Bishop, originally from North Carolina, was known for his outspokenness and his drive to end elitism in the black community.  Personal Information = Life = Gardner LaClede Bishop was a barber and activist remembered for his contributions to the school integration movement in the District of Columbia in the 1940s and 1950s. He was born on January 20, 1909 in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.[1] He learned how to express his opinions early on, winning prizes as a high school debater in his home state. Although he attended a year of college at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, he did not graduate. In 1930 he moved to Washington, D.C.[2] He lived east of the Anacostia River and, like his father, began working as a barber.[3] After challenging the comments of racist customers on multiple occasions, he was fired. Not cowed, he opened B&D; Barber Shop at 1515 U Street NW in 1940, which he owned and operated through his retirement in 1985. His black clientele could get both \\"a haircut and an earful\\" from the \\"barber of U Street.\\"[4] He was a member of the Presbyterian Church and was married for 58 years to Thelma Crutchfield Bishop, who died in 1989. They had three children: Judine Bishop Johnson, Anita Harley, and Gardner L. Bishop Jr. He died of kidney failure on November 25, 1992 at age 82.[5] = More than just Black and White = Bishop focused not only on the inequalities between black schools and white schools, but also on the differences between upper and lower class black schools and attitudes. He was appalled by the snobbishness of the elite black Washingtonians. Part of his motivation for organizing a strike at Browne Junior High School came from his rebuffed requests to transfer his daughter to Banneker Junior High. Middle class black officials informed him that because he was only a barber, his daughter could not go to Banneker, a school meant for the middle class. This rebuke infuriated Bishop, and fueled his mistrust of some of the activist organizations he saw as furthering the agendas of the upper classes of society, including the NAACP. Bishop verbalized his sense of frustration and oppression, saying, \\"We were on the bottom shelf. I‚Äôm black and I‚Äôm poor, so I‚Äôm segregated twice.\\"[6]  The fight against segregated schools = Overcrowded schools = When Bishop came to the nation's capital, the public school system was segregated, and the facilities for black children and white children were far from equal. As the population of the city expanded in the post World War II years, the schools, particularly the black schools, became overcrowded.[7] Between 1930 and 1950 the African American population alone doubled to 280,000 people, about 35% of D.C.'s total population.[8] The shifting demographics of the city, with whites fleeing to the suburbs and the proportion of the black population steadily increasing, led to an unequal distribution of students amongst the available facilities. Taxes were allocated to fund black schools and white schools based on population statistics collected in the decennial census, so by the end of the 1940s the black schools were receiving far less than their fair share of tax dollars based on the numbers of black children enrolled because of the outdated census data.[9] The situation at Browne Junior High School exemplified the failure of the school system to educate its constituents. By the late 1940s, Browne was operating at double its intended capacity. To accommodate the inflated student body, the school adopted a schedule of shifts that resulted in students receiving only 4 and a half hours of schooling per day. Because the law required that students attend school for a minimum of six hours per day, this restriction was particularly galling to parents.[10] In an attempt to remedy the situation, which many people objected to, the school implemented the use of two abandoned white elementary schools, Blow and Webb. With this plan 1146 students would move between Browne, Blow and Webb to receive a full day of instruction, and the other 680 students would continue with the shortened school day.[11] To make matters worse, nearby white schools were operating under capacity and had plenty of room to accommodate more students.[12] = Consolidated Parents Group = Gardner Bishop was unwilling to accept a substandard education for his children. His oldest daughter, Judine, attended Browne in 1947.[13] He was outraged by the use of schools that whites had abandoned, not to mention the long walks that students had to take in the middle of their school day to move to a different building. Bishop did not see this shifting schedule as an acceptable solution to the overcrowding. He and other disgruntled parents began holding meetings at Jones Memorial Church to discuss how to present their grievances to the school board. They eventually became known as the Consolidated Parents Group.[14] Bishop took charge as the most visible and vocal member of the group, but came to rely on a set of leaders within the group that grew to have hundreds of members. With Bishop as president, there were two vice presidents, Marie W. Smith and Burma Whitted, a secretary, Unity T. Macklin, and a treasurer, James Haley Sr. At one of their first meetings they voted to stage a student \\"sit-out\\" to boycott the situation at Browne Junior High School.[15] The boycott started on December 3, 1947. For two months, parents of Browne students refused to send their children to school. They picketed outside the school and the Board of Education offices at the Franklin Administration Building, protesting the insufficient resources being provided for their students. Eventually, due to pressure from the conservative black community and dwindling support, the boycott partially ended. The students returned to Browne but the boycott of Blow and Webb continued. When the boycott did come to an end on February 3, 1948 the Board of Education began using five school buildings so students would not have to switch buildings and could attend a full day of school.[16]  Bolling v. Sharpe  Bishop's organizational efforts did not stop at Browne. In 1949, he took a group of black students to the newly opened Sousa Junior High School, a school for whites with many amenities. The students were given a tour, but they were not allowed to enroll. This incident resulted in a lawsuit, with Spotswood Bolling, one of the students on the tour, as a plaintiff. The case was later argued in front of the Supreme Court with four other cases as part of the historic Brown v. Board of Education decision. Bolling v. Sharpe was unique because it introduced the argument that segregation itself was unconstitutional. Additionally, the NAACP was not involved in the Bolling case because of Bishop's continued suspicion of middle class black organizations.[17]  Legacy  Bishop's activism made an impact because his efforts were broad yet focused. He targeted specific injustices in the school system on a variety of fronts. The strike made a social statement and allowed people to see the problem up close. The court case attacked segregation from a legal standpoint, aimed at changing the laws themselves. In addition, Bishop wrote Letters to the Editor of the Washington Post, on topics including school buildings and high school capacity, putting his arguments into print.[18] [19] He was determined to ensure that whites did not become complacent because of the concessions allowed for middle class blacks in the school system. He worked for the lowest members of society, those whose voices and rights were consistently ignored by the established powers. Although Gardner Bishop was not the most prominent civil rights activist of his time, he serves as a reminder that no matter what background people come from, if they speak their minds and fight for what they believe in they can leave a lasting impact.

Written by Ramin Ganeshram and illustrated by Vanessa Brantley-Newton, it is narrated by Delia, the daughter of Hercules, one of George Washington's slaves who worked for him as a cook. The book tells the story of Hercules and Delia baking a birthday cake for Washington. Scholastic pulled the book on January 17, 2016 in response to criticisms over illustrations depicting an overly-positive portrayal of slavery. Criticism While generally praised by traditional reviewers, Vicky Smith wrote about problems with the book, in \\"Smiling Slaves in a Post-A Fine Dessert World\\" in Kirkus Reviews on January 4, 2016. Smith, Kirkus Reviews' teen book editor, compared the book to A Fine Dessert by Emily Jenkins, which also proved controversial because it depicted images of smiling slaves. She notes that Ganeshram did not mention in the narrative the fact that when Hercules escaped to freedom from Washington, he was forced to leave his daughter behind. Smith concluded that \\"It‚Äôs easy to understand why Ganeshram opted to leave those details out of her primary narrative: they‚Äôre a serious downer for readers, and they don‚Äôt have anything to do with the cake. But the story that remains nevertheless shares much of what ‚ÄòA Fine Dessert‚Äô‚Äôs critics found so objectionable: it‚Äôs an incomplete, even dishonest treatment of slavery.‚Äù This was followed by more critiques, including for the illustrations of the characters as ‚Äúsmiling slaves‚Äù and thereby whitewashing the history of slavery and presenting an \\"offensively sanitized version\\" of slavery to children. Among the critics were Kiera Parrott, who wrote in School Library Journal that the book was \\"highly problematic\\" and that it \\"convey[s] a feeling of joyfulness that contrasts starkly with the reality of slave life\\". As of January 18, the book had received over 100 one-star ratings on Amazon.com. On January 13, 2016, a critical review of the book by librarian Edith Campbell was posted on the Facebook page of the Washington, DC-based nonprofit Teaching for Change, along with a photo of the book‚Äôs back cover. On this same day, Leslie MacFadyen of the National #Ferguson Response Network entered the conversation and developed the hashtag #slaverywithasmile. This took the discussion beyond the children‚Äôs literature world to parents, educators, and activists. It also caught the attention of major media outlets, including the Atlanta Black Star, The Root, and Fusion. Thousands signed a protest petition at Change.org. Food historian Michael W. Twitty critiqued historical elements of the book in The Guardian while author Steve Sheinkin discussed the book in an Actually podcast. Debbie Reese of American Indians in Children‚Äôs Literature‚Äîwho had played a major role drawing public attention to the Mexican American studies ban in Tucson‚Äîdocumented the evolution of events on her blog. Author Daniel Jos√© Older tweeted about the book. Older's tweets, the petition, and a summary of the campaign were published on Common Dreams. The books controversy evolved into discussions about how to present enslavement in children‚Äôs books and censorship. Withdrawal Scholastic withdrew the book on January 17, 2016 following this criticism. In a statement, the publisher said: =Reaction to withdrawal= The decision to withdraw the book was criticized by anti-censorship activists like the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) and the PEN American Center, which released a statement saying that \\"Those who value free speech as an essential human right and a necessary precondition for social change should be alarmed whenever books are removed from circulation because they are controversial\\". The NCAC's statement also defended the book by saying that it had helped promote discussion about how Americans remember slavery. Scholastic responded to this statement by accusing both the NCAC and PEN of not correctly reading Scholastic's initial statement, and asserting that the book was withdrawn \\"not in response to criticism, but entirely and purposefully because this title did not meet our publishing standards\\" although Scholastic, not the author, or illustrator, was solely in charge of the publishing process. In an interview with the Associated Press, the author responded to the public outcry and withdrawal of the book, stating that she had continually voiced concerns about the ‚Äúover jovial‚Äù depiction of the enslaved characters but that she had been repeatedly ignored by the publisher. The book‚Äôs editor Andrea Davis Pinkney and illustrator Vanessa Brantley-Newton did not respond for requests for comment from the Associated Press. Farah Mendlesohn wrote that the decision by Scholastic to withdraw the book was product recall, not censorship, and argued that if \\"it is acceptable and ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù to turn [the story of Hercules] into a happy little story about a slave serving his master joyfully, then I look forward to Scholastic producing a bright little picture book called The Children‚Äôs Choir of Terezin.\\" References External links  *Slavery in children's books: What works? in the Chicago Tribune by Nara Schoenberg, February 15, 2016 *Children's Literature About Slavery: The Struggle Continues Storify of tweets, compiled by Ebony Elizabeth-Thomas Category:2016 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Scholastic Corporation books ","title":"A Birthday Cake for George Washington"},{"id":"49242954","text":"Youth is a 2013 Israeli - German drama film written and directed by Tom Shoval.

Natchitoches Trace was superseded by the Southwest Trail in historical times. History The Natchitoches Trace was a trade route between the Missouri River basin to the Red River basin. From Natchitoches, another American Indian path led to Tenochtitlan, capital of the Aztec empire, site of present-day Mexico City. The site of future Natchitoches, Louisiana was key trading point, and became the first permanent settlement in the Louisiana Purchase territory. The trade route was named for the Natchitoches branch of the Caddo confederation. As late as the early 1800s, Natchitoches people still lived in the Hot Springs, Arkansas region, and probably visited the springs that today are part of Hot Springs National Park. Early European explorers followed Natchitoches Trace in the future territories of Missouri and Arkansas. Much of the prehistoric path was adopted by the Southwest Trail when American pioneers later traveled to Arkansas and Texas. The paths varied the most south of the Arkansas River. The American Indian path traveled to Hot Springs, then followed the Ouachita River southward to Louisiana, while Southwest Trail users generally were headed to Texas. Route From the mouth of the Missouri River, Natchitoches Trace passed through Wayne County, Missouri. The Indian trace was the southern route of two followed by Cherokees and their enslaved Africans during the Trail of Tears. In Arkansas, it followed much of the Black River to its mouth on the White River, site of present-day Jacksonport. From Hot Springs, roughly midway on the footpath, Natchitoches Trace followed the Ouachita River downstream. The Ouachita, part of the Red River basin, flows southward to Louisiana's Black River, then to the Red River and Natchitoches, Louisiana.

In 1938, Walter Leuba married Martha Leuba (n√©e Dryburgh), with whom he lived in their house-cum-library at 516 Jacksonia Street in Pittsburgh until his death in 1983. Legacy and collection The Leubas began donating portions of their collections to the University of Pittsburgh's Special Collections during the 1970s, and Special Collections received the remainder of the expansive collection after Martha Leuba's death in 1988. This marked a major change of heart for Walter Leuba, who said to an interviewer from the University of Pittburgh, said he would not donate his books to the Hillman Library, continuing, ‚Äú‚Ä¶I would no more dream of leaving them to a local library than jumping in the river.\\" In all, Leuba donated over 11,000 volumes and at least 700 woodblock prints. The contents of the Leuba's home were inventoried and catalogued and are held by the University of Pittsburgh University Library System Special Collections Department.

The Spanish attempts to block the entrance of foreign ships to the eastern Pacific proved fruitless due to the failure to settle the Strait of Magellan and the discovery of the Drake Passage. As result of this the Spanish settlement at Chilo√© Archipelago became a centre from where the west coast of Patagonia was protected from foreign powers. In face of the international wars that involved the Spanish Empire in the second half of the 18th century the Crown was unable to directly protect peripheral colonies like Chile leading to local government and militias assuming the increased responsibilities. Timeline of privateer and pirate activity The following is a list of expedition and seafarers who landed or sailed in Chile with hostile intentions towards Spain or during times the country they served was at war with Spain. { \\"wikitable sortable\\" width=\\"99%\\"  !style=\\"background:#CCCCCC;\\" width=\\"10%\\"  Year(s) !style=\\"background:#CCCCCC;\\" width=\\"15%\\"  Commander !style=\\"background:#CCCCCC;\\" width=\\"15%\\"  Places attacked !style=\\"background:#CCCCCC;\\" width=\\"60%\\"  Details - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1578‚Äì1580  Francis Drake  Valpara√≠so, La Serena, Arica  Francis Drake was one of the first corsairs to attack the Chilean coast. With his ship the Golden Hind Drake sailed north along the Pacific coast of South America, attacking Spanish ports and pillaging towns. Some Spanish ships were captured, and Drake used their more accurate charts. Before reaching the coast of Peru, Drake visited Mocha Island, where he was seriously injured by hostile Mapuche. Later he sacked the port of Valpara√≠so further north in Chile where he also captured a ship full of Chilean wine. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1587  Thomas Cavendish  Quintero  Thomas Cavendish's expedition begun once he sailed off Plymouth in 1586. He entered the Strait of Magellan and after finding the settlement of Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe abandoned, which he named Port Famine, he sailed north to the thriving Spanish settlements in Chile. At the ruins of Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe Cavendish rescued a survivor who later escaped and alarmed Spanish authorities of Cavendish's presence. Cavendish made a failed attempt at attacking the port of Quintero in Central Chile before he left Chile for Peru, Mexico and the Philippines. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1593  Richard Hawkins  Valpara√≠so  In 1593, the English privateer Richard Hawkins led an expedition to the Pacific with three ships. Passing the Strait of Magellan, he had one ship left, the Dainty, with which Hawkins transited some parts of the Chilean coast and attacked Valpara√≠so. He was later captured by a Spanish squadron from the Fleet of the South Sea. Hawkins was pardoned and deported back to England. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1600  Olivier van Noort  None  Visited Santa Mar√≠a Island - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1600  Simon de Cordes Baltazar de Cordes  Castro  In 1600 local Huilliche joined the Dutch corsair Baltazar de Cordes to attack the Spanish settlement of Castro. While this was a sporadic attack the Spanish believed the Dutch could attempt to ally the Mapuches and establish a stronghold in southern Chile. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1614  Joris van Spilbergen  None  Visited Santa Mar√≠a Island - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1643  Hendrik Brouwer Elias Herckman  Carelmapu, Castro  The Spanish knew of the Dutch plans to establish themselves at the ruins of Valdivia so they attempted to re- establish Spanish rule there before the Dutch arrived again.Bengoa 2003, pp. 450‚Äì451. The Spanish attempts were thwarted in the 1630s when Mapuches did not allow the Spanish to pass by their territory. The Dutch occupation of Valdivia in 1643 caused great alarm among Spanish authorities and triggered the construction of the Valdivian Fort System that begun in 1645.Robbert Kock The Dutch in Chili at coloniavoyage.comLane 1998, pp. 88‚Äì92 - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1670  John Narborough  None  In response to John Narborough's explorations and Crist√≥bal Talcapill√°n's claims of English bases in Patagonia the Spanish organized the Antonio de Vea expedition which ran the 1675‚Äì1676 summer seeking to find out any news about English presence. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1680‚Äì1681  Bartholomew Sharp  La Serena, Iquique, Arica  In 1680 the English corsair Bartholomew Sharp raided in turn La Serena, Iquique, Arica to then continue to attack Spanish possessions in Peru. The Spanish governor Jos√© de Garro had foreknowledge of Sharps incursion and ordered Valpara√≠so, Concepci√≥n and Valdivia to prepare. In this view the raid on La Serena was a complete surprise for the Spanish. At the very last moment a militia was formed in La Serena but it was dispersed after a confrontation with Sharps troops. La Serena's inhabitants fled the city and Sharp occupied it for three days. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1686  William Knight  La Serena  In May 1686 he landed in Tongoy near La Serena. The Spanish engaged the pirates who left. One pirate was taken prisoner and sent to Lima. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1686  Edward Davis  La Serena  In September 1686 Davis led a failed attack on La Serena. Upon meeting resistance pirates took up a defensive position in a local church. When finally leaving the city the pirates had lost 11 men, including a prisoner who died shortly thereafter. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1704  Thomas Stradling  None  Left Alexander Selkirk on Robinson Crusoe Island. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1709  Woodes Rogers  None  Picked up Alexander Selkirk on Robinson Crusoe Island. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1720  George Shelvocke  None  On 25 May 1720 the Shelvocke's ship Speedwell was wrecked on an island of Juan Fern√°ndez called M√°s a Tierra by the Spanish. Shelvocke and his crew were marooned there for five months but managed to build a 20-ton boat using some timbers and hardware salvaged from the wreck, in addition to wood obtained from locally felled trees. They left the island on 6 October to continue hostilities against the Spanish Empire. - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1721  John Clipperton  Arica - bgcolor=#FFFFCC  1741  George Anson David Cheap  None  The arrival of George Anson's expedition to Chilean waters happened at a time Spain and Britain were at war. After a troublesome passage into the Pacific from the Atlantic the remaining ships (Centurion and Tryal) regrouped in Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. HMS Wager wrecked in Guayaneco Archipelago leading to various searches by the Spanish after the survivors or any further British activity in western Patagonia. } ;Seven Years' War As consequence of the Seven Years' War the Valdivian Fort System, a Spanish defensive complex in southern Chile, was updated and reinforced from 1764 onwards. Other vulnerable localities of colonial Chile such as Chilo√© Archipelago, Concepci√≥n, Juan Fern√°ndez Islands and Valpara√≠so were also made ready for an eventual English attack. ;American Revolutionary War With Spain and Great Britain at war again in the 1770s due to the American Revolutionary War local Spanish authorities in Chile received in 1779 the warning that a British fleet commanded by Edward Hughes was heading to Chilean coasts for an imminent attack. As consequence of this the Viceroyalty of Peru send economic aid to the garrisons at Valpara√≠so and Valdivia. The suspected attack did however never happen. In late 1788 suspicion of British attack rose appeared once again, this time stemming from observations of ships off the coast of Coquimbo. A defense plan where militias played a major role was hastily made up. Niebla Fort, one of the many forts the Spanish established around Corral Bay following the Dutch occupation of Valdivia. Spanish initiatives=Preventing entry to the Pacific Ocean= In the 16th and 17th century Spain considered the Pacific Ocean a Mare clausum ‚Äì a sea closed to other naval powers. As the only known entrance from the Atlantic the Strait of Magellan was at times patrolled by fleets sent to prevent entrance of non-Spanish ships. On the western end of the Pacific Ocean the Dutch threatened the Spanish Philippines. To end navigation by rival powers in the Strait of Magellan Spanish viceroy Francisco de Toledo ordered Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa to explore the strait and found settlements on its shores. =Building fortifications= In Colonial times the Spanish Empire diverted significant resources to fortify the Chilean coast as consequence of Dutch and English raids. This was particularly true for the expensive Valdivian Fort System built after what would be the last Dutch incursion into Chile since Dutch rule in Brazil, from where the expedition to Chile was made, collapsed in 1645.Lane 1998, p. 90. However the investments in the defense of Corral Bay validated in 1670 when a fully armed ship commanded by John Narborough's arrived to the bay rising suspicions of an imminent English attack. A Spanish fort near Taitao Peninsula was manned for one and half year beginning in 1750 before being abandoned. =Increased local participation in the defence= Spain's international wars in the second half of the 18th century evidenced the empire's difficulties in reinforcing its colonial possessions and provide them with economic aid. This led to an increased local participation in the financing of the defense and an increased participation in the militias by the Chilean-born. Such development was at odds with the ideals of the centralized absolute monarchy. The Spanish did also formal concessions to strengthen the defense: In Chilo√© Spanish authorities promised freedom from the encomienda those indigenous locals who settled near the new stronghold of Ancud (founded in 1768) and contributed to its defense. The increased local organization of the defenses would ultimately undermine metropolitan authority and bolster the independence movement. =New roads= In the last decades of the 18th century the Spanish set out to build roads between strategic places in the coast. One such road, Caicumeo, connected the \\"city-fort\\" of Ancud with Castro. Another large road was projected to connect Valdivia with the settlements at the northern shores of Chacao Channel providing a pathway for reciprocal military aid. On October 1788 the Governor of Valdivia Mariano Pusterla sent an expedition to traverse the Huilliche-ruled territories to reach Chilo√©. The expedition preved successful and by February 1789 the men were back in Valdivia.Barros Arana 2000, p. 50. Pusterla subsequently arranged to improve the path to Chilo√©, in particularly to widen it at places is was a narrow path along forests. In a parliament with local Cuncos and Huilliches Pusterla assured the opening of the path along there would not imply a reestablishment of the city of Osorno. However the transit along this road depended on the goodwill of the local tribes and on September 1792 Huilliches revolted against Spanish encroachment.Barros Arana 2000, p. 65. =Patrolling western Patagonia= The Wreck of the Wager, the frontispiece from John Byron's account The Spanish failure at colonizing the Strait of Magellan made Chilo√© Archipelago assume the role of protecting the area of western Patagonia from foreign intrusions. Valdivia, restablished in 1645, and Chilo√© acted as sentries being hubs where the Spanish collected information and rumours from all-over Patagonia. John Narborough's 1670 expedition to Patagonia and Valdiva, despite being done in peace time, caused much suspicion among Spanish authorities. In response the Spanish organized the Jer√≥nimo Diez de Mendoza, Bartolom√© Gallardo and Antonio de Vea expeditions which ran three consecutive summers from 1674 to 1676 seeking to find out any news about English bases in western Patagonia. Following the last expedition Spanish interest in the area waned and the focus of Spanish attention to repel tentative English settlements shifted from the Pacific coast of Patagonia to the Straits of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego. In the aftermath of the wreck of HMS Wager (1741) in Guayaneco Archipelago a series of expeditions and patrolling was done in the coasts of Patagonia by the Spanish. A book based on the Wager wreck published in 1748 in England exposed weaknesses of the Spanish rule in the Southeastern Pacific. This book together with rumors of a new British expedition made the Viceroy of Peru send expeditions to populate Juan Fernandez Islands, establish a fort in the island of Tenquehu√©n near Taitao Peninsula, and search for a frigate the British would supposedly have sent into the southeast Pacific. =Depopulation and scorched earth strategy= As result of the corsair and pirate menace Spanish authorities ordered to depopulate Guaitecas Archipelago to deprive enemies of any eventual support from native populations. This the led to the transfer of indigenous Chono population to Chilo√© Archipelago in the north while some Chonos moved south of Taitao Peninsula effectively depopulating the territory in the 18th century. When the Spanish learned about the impeding Dutch expedition to Valdivia in the 1640s Pedro de Toledo, Viceroy of Peru, sent letters ordering local Spanish authorities use a scorched earth strategy against the invaders.Lane 1998, p. 89.

History of the painting  detail:Arno≈°t of Pardubice The altarpiece for the Augustinian monastery in K≈Çodzko was commissioned before 1350 by Archbishop Arno≈°t of Pardubice, the monastery's founder, who spent his youth at the parish church there and, as a child, reputedly had a vision of the Virgin Mary. As archbishop he was the founder of the Marian cult in the Czech lands. He is buried in the Church of the Ascension of the Virgin Mary in K≈Çodzko. The original winged altarpiece, which included another four panels with painted scenes depicting the life of Christ (the Birth of Jesus, the Circumcision, the Flight to Egypt and the Twelve- year-old Christ in the Temple) was seen and described by Bohuslav Balb√≠nA. Matƒõjƒçek, 1950, p. 48 in his work Vita Venerabilis Arnesti primi archiepiscopi Pragensis of 1664. The monastery was taken over from the Augustinians by the Jesuits and until 1618 served as a Jesuit college. Although K≈Çodzko was besieged and damaged during the Thirty Years‚Äô War, the altar was saved by the burgrave Johann Georg Semling and the Lutheran nobleman Adrian von Eckersdorf. After 1625 the altarpiece was the pride of the local parish church and in the 19th century it was situated in the royal grammar school in K≈Çodzko. From there, the painting of the enthroned Madonna was purchased in 1902 by the Berlin Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum. It now belongs to the Berlin-Dahlem State Museum.  Description  This monumental picture is 186 x 95 cm large and is tempera painted on stretched canvas over a poplar panel. It is a work that comes from the circle of the Master of the Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod Altarpiece or his follower. The motif of the Enthroned Madonna surrounded by angels, the composition of space united by the perspective-based receding of lines, the dark-skinned complexion, the unusual size of the child and the fondness for precious fabrics all have their origin in northern Italy.Pe≈°ina J, 1976, p. 25 At the same time, however, a series of details indicate a direct influence mediated by the Rhineland. The Madonna's crown of leaves and richly folded veil appear as archaic French models that emerged in Bohemian book painting as soon as the early 14th century. The architecture of the throne also relates to French ivory reliefs.Anton√≠n Matƒõjƒçek, ƒåesk√° malba gotick√°, Melantrich v Praze, 1950, pp. 48-49 The soft modelling of the faces links this picture with the work of the Master of Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod. The appearance of the Madonna and angels links it with the panel paintings The Adoration of the Magi, The Annunciation, The Resurrection and The Lamentation of the Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod Altarpiece. Both the \\"Madonna of Veve≈ô√≠\\" and the \\"Strahov Madonna\\" belong to the same period as the K≈Çodzko Madonna, while the artist who painted the Kaufmann CrucifixionAnton√≠n Matƒõjƒçek, ƒåesk√° malba gotick√°, Melantrich v Praze, 1950, p. 52 also belonged to a broader circle perhaps linked by previous training in the workshop of the \\"Master of the Klosterneuberg Altarpiece\\". Compared with the Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod panels, the K≈Çodzko Madonna shows several important innovations, especially in the perspectival projection of the throne, the accentuating of spatial depth through the colour-based graduating of areas, the modelling of the high relief of the drapery and in the overall human warmth of the presentation from which the entire typology of Bohemian loving Madonnas was developed right through to the early 15th century.Kutal J, 1972, p. 57  Notes  References  * Robert Suckale, Matthias Weniger, Manfred Wundram, Gothic (Basic Art), Taschen 2006, / Slovart, 2007, * Robert Suckale: Die Glatzer Madonnentafel des Prager Erzbischofs Ernst von Pardubitz als gemalter Marienhymnus.

It is a diploid with 2n=2x=24. It is a member within the C. pubescens complex, a group of closely related Capsicum species. It is closely related to C. eximium. It is native to the Andes, and it can be found in Bolivia and Peru . The native name is ulupica. Vegetative characteristics Capsicum cardenasii, like most members of the Pubescens complex, is a perennial plant that develops woody stems. The plant can grow up 2‚Äì3 feet high with a width of 1-1.5 feet. The leaves are narrow, lanceolate and pubescent. Plants generally produce between 1 and 2 flowers at the internodes. The petioles grow erect and have campanulate, pendant flowers.http://www.botany.wisc.edu/courses/botany_940/06CropEvol/papers/Walsh%2601.pdf The corolla is white and purple colored. The plant produces small, fleshy, red fruit. It is likely the wild ancestor of rocoto peppers. The plant requires a cool, freeze free environment and long growing season similar to its native environment in the Andes.  Reproduction  After fertilization C. cardenasii develops small round red berries, sometimes referred to as chiltepins. The fruits contain a small number of seed. The fruit are pungent, near 30 000 SHU (Scoville Heat Units), making them quite spicy. Capsicum cardenasii is self- incompatible, and exhibits unilateral incompatibility with species outside the pubescens clade.  Uses  Its primary use is as a spice. Many wild Capsicums exhibit disease resistance of interest to plant breeders. C. cardenasii has been shown to be resistant to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and there is a possibility that one day this resistance may be transferred to other capsicum species through breeding.

Background The event was officially announced in November 2015 as \\"UFC 197,\\" taking place on March 5, 2016 at HSBC Arena in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Weeks later on December 29, UFC announced that the event was canceled and would be moved to a different location. On January 12, it was confirmed the event would take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. On January 13, UFC revealed this event was originally intended to take place at Arena da Baixada (a much larger venue) in Curitiba, Brazil, and feature a UFC Heavyweight Championship rematch between champion Fabr√≠cio Werdum and former two-time champion Cain Velasquez, with former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva in the co-main event slot, possibly against Michael Bisping. Due to a series of injuries, the company moved the heavyweight bout to a separate event scheduled for February 6, which at that time was titled \\"UFC 196\\". This change made the March 5 event a smaller draw, which led to the transition to the smaller venue in Rio de Janeiro. To maintain local interest, the company then considered booking the main event as a rematch between two Brazilian fighters, Silva and former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Vitor Belfort. Belfort declined the bout, as he wished to wait for the result of the middleweight title fight at UFC 194. This final fall-through is what prompted the cancellation of the event in Brazil and relocation to Las Vegas. On January 27, it was revealed the Werdum- Velasquez bout (which had been moved to \\"UFC 196\\" scheduled for February 6, 2016) was cancelled entirely. This forced that event to alter into a \\"UFC Fight Night\\" card, and the originally scheduled \\"UFC 197\\" event was renamed UFC 196. The event was expected to be headlined by a UFC Lightweight Championship bout between champion Rafael dos Anjos and UFC Featherweight Champion Conor McGregor. This would have been the second time in UFC history that champions in different divisions would fight for the same title. The first time was at UFC 94 on January 31, 2009, when then-UFC Welterweight Champion Georges St-Pierre defended his title against then-lightweight champion B.J. Penn. On February 23, the planned bout suffered a setback as it was announced that dos Anjos pulled out due to a broken foot. Former UFC Featherweight Champion Jos√© Aldo declined the initial opportunity to replace him due to \\"lack of time\\" to prepare for the bout. Former lightweight champion and top featherweight contender Frankie Edgar also declined the opportunity due to a groin injury. Eventually, The Ultimate Fighter 5 winner and former lightweight title challenger Nate Diaz was announced as the replacement and the bout took place in the welterweight division. A UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between then champion Holly Holm and former Strikeforce Women's Bantamweight Champion Miesha Tate co-headlined the event. Michael Johnson was expected to face Tony Ferguson in a lightweight rematch. On January 27, it was announced that Johnson withdrew from the bout due to injury. Ferguson was then rescheduled to fight at UFC on Fox: Nurmagomedov vs. Ferguson on April 16 against Khabib Nurmagomedov. A welterweight bout between Brandon Thatch and Siyar Bahadurzada, originally slated for UFC Fight Night: Cowboy vs. Cowboy, was rescheduled to this event due to Thatch's medication being banned by Pennsylvania's athletic commission.

The Waitress is the most prominent recurring character in the series and originally a waitress at a Philadelphia coffee shop; she is the unfortunate love interest of main character Charlie Kelly (Charlie Day), who routinely stalks her, as she goes from disgusted to tolerant of him before marrying by season 13. Overview The Waitress is the most frequently featured character of the recurring cast of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. The Waitress is not a part of \\"the Gang,\\" but frequently finds herself involved in the Gang's antics due to being dragged in as a pawn for one member to get revenge on or humiliate another member. Despite having an on-again off-again crush on Dennis Reynolds, the Waitress despises the Gang, most notably Dee Reynolds, who is responsible for most of The Waitress's involuntary involvement with the Gang. The Waitress is openly stalked by Charlie Kelly, who is enamored with her, but the Waitress constantly rebuffs him. She has numerous restraining orders against him, but that doesn't stop him, as she begins to allow him to continue his obsession when she realizes he has been helping her avoid danger by testing her food for poison and putting vitamins in her shampoo. The Waitress is \\"easily forgettable\\" according to the Gang, who only refer to her as \\"The Waitress,\\" with the only one who possibly knows her name being Charlie. Dennis once received a phone call from The Waitress, but he did not recognize who she was when she referred to herself by her real name. Her name tag was also missing at the high school reunion and Dee forgot she went to school with her, believing that they met ten years later when Charlie introduced them. The Waitress has worked a number of menial side jobs alongside her occupation as a coffee shop waitress, including a manager of a corporate pub, a booth manager at a carnival, and a food delivery woman. She struggles financially and eventually ends up in a women's shelter. The Waitress is an on-again off-again alcoholic, who has been involved with Alcoholics Anonymous for years, but as a result of the Gang's actions, she repeatedly relapses. When intoxicated, she is rude and belligerent. Relationships=Charlie Kelly= Charlie Kelly openly stalks The Waitress, and keeps a journal of all her activities and whereabouts day to day, but Dee steals it in return for a favor from The Waitress. It is likely he has begun a new one although Charlie has stated that he \\"has copies\\" of the original. On occasion, he has hired other people to stalk her and report her whereabouts. The Waitress has issued several restraining orders against Charlie, but amends them to allow Charlie to come within a fifty-foot radius after many of the tasks Charlie completes for her, including putting vitamins in her shampoo, testing her food for poison, and killing rats for her apartment go unfinished, and The Waitress realizes that Charlie is valuable to her life as he is the only person who cares about her well being. She also gets jealous when Charlie finds an interest in a new woman, demanding to know who \\"that bitch\\" is. Charlie goes to great lengths in order to woo The Waitress, including trying to impress her by demonstrating his paternal nature by pretending to raise other people's children. He also fabricates a story about him having terminal cancer when he sees her wearing a Lance Armstrong bracelet. He also attempts to connect with her by pretending to be an alcoholic so he could continue to spend time with her at Alcoholics Anonymous, where he continues to guilt her into being his sponsor. The pair share an enjoyable night together at the beach, frolicking and holding hands and falling asleep in each other's arms. But in the morning The Waitress reveals she was high on Ecstasy and doesn't remember any of their encounter. Charlie once proposed to The Waitress, but she declined. In the end of Season 12, Charile invited The Waitress over to show her a presentation he made on where her life is going. He continues to explain how her life is over and time is ticking so she should have a kid with him. After a brief argument, Charlie responds to her question of, \\"Why do you even want me?!\\" with, \\"I love you.\\" This prompts the two to have sex. In Season 13, Charlie and the Waitress' relationship is explored, with Charlie becoming increasingly distant from her due to finding her annoying and \\"a total bitch.\\" Despite her breaking up with him after having an affair with the Dennis sex doll, she continues to appear in episodes taking place before and after Dennis returned to Philadelphia, such as serving as Dee's rival during the Ladies Beats Boggs reboot challenge and going to the Super Bowl without Charlie. In Season 14, the Waitress made a guest appearance when Charlie recalled a series of events in the form of a 40s noir film. The Waitress was using a cherry poisoning scheme to consume alcohol behind her AA representative's back and earn some money due, but Charlie found out. She ended up poisoning Charlie with a cherry pie, claiming that they were \\"getting too close,\\" implying she still has feelings for him. Charlie dismissed her, however, realising the pie was poison. He thought drinking a shot of bleach would cancel out the poison, but ended up vomiting all over her. Before she could skip town, she was arrested by a police officer (by Dee dressed as a police officer in Charlie's memory of the story) and taken to jail. A large amount of the story was likely not altered and simply made up by Charlie, heavily implying he still thinks about her romantically long after she left him. =Dennis Reynolds= Dennis does not care for The Waitress whatsoever; however, she is notably infatuated with him. When together, she seems to forget herself and follows Dennis blindly and will do most anything to get his attention; some instances even involve her making decisions against her better moral judgment. Her most extreme cases of trying to grab Dennis's attention include being Charlie's sponsor for Alcoholics Anonymous, grinding on homeless people, and sleeping with Frank. On several occasions, Dennis has used her undying love for him against her, mostly to blackmail Charlie into doing whatever it is Dennis would like. He has slept, flirted, dated, and been in overall close sexual contact with The Waitress in order to do said blackmailing, usually involving \\"climbing up the ranks\\" of Paddy's, getting out of Charlie work (earlier in the series) or general tomfoolery. Throughout the course of the show, Dennis has slept with The Waitress several times, of which he records their sex, giving it a \\"one star\\" rating in terms of enjoyability and fun. =Mac= Mac has a detached relationship with The Waitress outside of trying to sleep with her in order to upset Charlie, on account of Charlie smashing one of Mac's \\"Project Badass\\" tapes. This is later revealed to be untrue, as the tape Charlie was smashing was actually Frank and The Waitress's sex tape that Charlie mistakenly watched. Mac and The Waitress actually have only engaged in \\"hand stuff.\\" =Frank= The Waitress sleeps with Frank in order to make Dennis jealous of her. She does this under the guidance of Dee, who is being instructed by Charlie, in order to get The Waitress (through a convoluted plan) to like him. Unbeknownst to anyone for a long time after, Frank records their sex. His toup√©e falls off during their love-making session. She has sex with Frank again on a plane during the Ladies Beat Boggs reboot. Real name Many fans interpreted the seventh season's two-part finale, \\"High School Reunion,\\" as an indirect reveal of The Waitress's real name. In the episode, The Gang attends their high school reunion and Frank, feeling left out, decides to go with them. Since there is no name tag for him, Frank takes the name tag of Nikki Potnick; later on, The Waitress shows up drunk and complaining that there was no tag with her name on it at the table, seemingly implying that Frank took her name tag and that she is Nikki Potnick; however, Glenn Howerton (who plays Dennis on the show and is also a writer and executive producer), said that it was just a joke about no one knowing The Waitress‚Äôs name, as well as a call-back to the first season episode \\"Underage Drinking: A National Concern.\\" References Category:It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia characters Category:Fictional alcohol abusers Category:Fictional characters from Philadelphia Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional characters without a name Category:Fictional waiting staff ","title":"The Waitress (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)"},{"id":"49243704","text":"Southorpe is a civil parish in the city of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England.

It is an erect shrub, branching from the base with narrow, sticky leaves, and white to pale lilac-coloured flowers and is found only in the south west corner of the state. Description Eremophila linsmithii is an erect, top-shaped shrub branching from its base, usually growing to a height of between . The branches, leaves and sepals are sticky and shiny due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are mostly long, wide, linear in shape and hairy, although the hairs are often obscured by the resin. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on stalks long. There are 5 overlapping green to reddish- brown, egg-shaped sepals which are mostly long but which enlarge after flowering. The 5 petals are long, and are joined at their bases to form a tube. The petal tube is white to pale lilac-coloured and glabrous on the outside. The inside surface of some of the petal lobes is hairy and the inside of the tube is woolly. There are four stamens which are fully enclosed in the tube. The fruit is dry, flask-shaped, about long with a papery covering. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by R.J.F. Henderson in 1978 and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (linsmithii) honours the Australian botanist, Lindsay Stuart Smith. Distribution and habitat Eremophila linsmithii is found along drainage lines and on stony slopes in the far south- western corner of Queensland, often growing in association with mulga and other eremophilas. Conservation Eremophila linsmithii is classified by the Queensland Government as of \\"least concern\\". Use in horticulture This eremophila is a hardy shrub with bright green leaves and large flowers and is suitable for a low-maintenance garden. It can be propagated from cuttings and grown in most soils, including heavy clay and only needs the occasional watering during a long drought. It will tolerate light frosts and if damaged by a severe frost can be rejuvenated by pruning.

This includes the current R142, R142A, R143, R160, R179, and R188 models and the planned R211 and R262 models. Two prototypes, the R110A and R110B, were used to test the features that would be found on all NTT trains today. Sometimes referred to as New Millennium Trains, they are known for improvements in technology, energy efficiency, reliability, and comfort along with advanced passenger information systems. All of these trains are capable of operating with communications-based train control (CBTC)‚Äîwhich can allow for automatic train controls and compatibility with updated signal systems‚Äîand either already have CBTC or are scheduled to be retrofitted with the system. http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/190122_1400_CPOC.pdf http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/170724_1345_CPOC.pdf Much of the engineering and construction efforts for the fleet have been done by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Bombardier Transportation, with Alstom also participating in the construction of the R160 fleet. List of New Technology Trains This is a list of all NTT trains operated by the New York City Subway, as well as future trains and retired trains. =Current= * R142 ‚Äì Built by Bombardier Transportation. The first production model of NTT trains ever built. Built for the A Division. Entered service on July 10, 2000. Assigned to the 2, 4 and 5 routes. The R142s are similar to the R142As and the R188s. * R142A ‚Äì Built by Kawasaki Rail Car Company. The second model of NTT trains. Used by the A Division. Also entered service on July 10, 2000, the same day the R142s entered service. 380 cars converted into R188s. 220 cars remain unconverted, while the remaining 220 cars are currently assigned to the 4. The R142As are similar to the R142s and nearly identical to the R188s. * R143 ‚Äì Built by Kawasaki Rail Car Company. The third model of NTTs and the first model of NTTs for the B Division, assigned to the L. Entered service on February 12, 2002. Equipped with CBTC, the first subway car to be equipped with this feature. The R143s are similar to the R160s and R179s. * R160 ‚Äì Built by Alstom and Kawasaki Rail Car Company. Used by the B Division. The fourth model of NTT trains. There are two subtypes since these cars were built by two different manufacturers. R160As were built by Alstom, while R160Bs were built by Kawasaki. The R160Bs entered service on August 17, 2006, while the R160As entered service on October 17, 2006. Currently, the R160s are assigned to the E, F, J/Z, L, M, N, Q, R, and W routes. 17 four-car sets, have CBTC for the L. An additional 309 sets, configured in four and five-car sets, will be equipped with CBTC for the IND Queens Boulevard Line, which the E, F, M, and R routes run on. https://new.mta.info/document/13836 The R160s are similar to the R143s and R179s; none of them are interchangeable, however. * R179 ‚Äì Built by Bombardier Transportation. The sixth model of NTT trains. Used by the B Division. The first car to be delivered, numbered 3014, arrived at 207th Street Yard on September 6, 2016. The R179s entered service on December 27, 2017. All cars were delivered by the end of December 2019. https://m.facebook.com/BombardierRail/photos/a.902865919774651/2806951702699387/?type=3 Currently, the R179s are assigned to the A, C, and J/Z routes. The R179s are similar to the R160s and R143s. * R188 ‚Äì Built by the Kawasaki Rail Car Company. The fifth model of NTT trains. The R188s entered service on December 15, 2013. They are used exclusively on the 7 route of the A Division, and thus is grouped in eleven-car trains, and are CBTC equipped. The order consists of 380 converted R142A cars and of 126 identical newly built cars. The R188s are similar to the R142s in addition to being nearly identical to the R142As. =Future= * R211 ‚Äì To be built by Kawasaki Rail Car Company. Will be used by the B Division, as well as the Staten Island Railway. 20 cars are open- gangway experimental prototype cars. Will possibly also have Wi-Fi, security cameras, digital video screens and electronic charging stations. The design of the R211 will be completely different compared to the design of the other NTT trains. * R262 ‚Äì Will be used by the A Division. Will replace the R62 and R62A fleet, and include open gangways, communications-based train control, and ethernet systems. Manufacturer is to be announced. =Retired= * R110A ‚Äì Contract number was R130. Built by Kawasaki Rail Car Company and used mainly on the 2 route. Was a prototype train for the A Division that operated from 1993 to 1999. Used to test out new technology features that would be incorporated into the R142 car order. Was not intended for long-term production use. All B-cars of the set were converted into pump cars between 2013 and 2014. All A-cars set to be converted in the future. * R110B ‚Äì Contract number was R131. Built by Bombardier Transportation and used mainly on the A route. Also ran on the C route for final years in service. Was a prototype train for the B Division that operated from 1993 to 2000. Designed to test various new technology features that would eventually be incorporated into the R143 car order and was also not intended for long-term production use. Five cars were sent away, while four cars remain at 207th Street Yard. History Two R110B cars, the B Division NTT prototype, stored at 207th Street Yard The New Technology program emerged from modernization efforts by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) beginning in 1982, when the subway \\"was on the verge of collapse\\". The New Technology program officially began in 1988, the first effort at a technologically advanced subway car since the R44 in the early 1970s. In 1989, the MTA awarded contracts for two prototype test trains: the R110A (contract R130) for the A Division built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the R110B (contract R131) for the B Division built by Bombardier Transportation. The two New Technology test trains (NTTTs) began service in June 1993, testing features that would be implemented on future mass-production orders. Both trains were taken out of service by 2000, due to multiple issues with the trains. In 1997, the first mass order of New Technology trains was placed for the R142 and R142A trains of the A Division (awarded to Bombardier and Kawasaki respectively), in order to replace the final 1,410 Redbird cars in operation. In 1998, a smaller contract of 212 cars, consisting of 100 in the base order and 112 in the optional order, was awarded to Kawasaki Heavy Industries, to build the R143 model for the B Division's BMT Eastern Division (primarily the BMT Canarsie Line's L train). The first R142s and R142As entered service beginning in July 2000. The R143s began operation in February 2002. The interior of an R160 in 2010 In July 2002, the MTA awarded contracts to Kawasaki and Alstom Transportation for the R160 order for the B Division, with options for up to 1,700 cars to replace many 1960s- and 1970s-era cars. The first R160 train, built by Kawasaki under the contract R160B, began service on August 17, 2006, on the . The initial 660-car base order was filled by October 2008, with a total of 1,662 cars delivered by May 6, 2010. On May 5, 2010, Kawasaki was awarded the contract for the R188 A Division order, to provide 46 CBTC-ready 11-car trains for the IRT Flushing Line (). Unlike the other orders, the R188 constructed only 126 new subway cars, with the remaining 380 cars consisting of converted R142As. On June 4, 2012, Bombardier was awarded the R179 contract for 300 new B Division cars, to replace the 50 R42s on the BMT Jamaica Line ().R179 Staff Summary In December 2012, preliminary designs began on the R211 B Division contract, which entails 940 cars in order to expand the system fleet, and to replace the R46 fleet, and the R44 fleet of the Staten Island Railway; both models were built in the 1970s. Both the R179 and R211 orders are supposed to replace the 222 remaining R32 cars, which were built in the 1960s and have run well past their expected lives, by the year 2022., however, in January 2020, it was decided that the R179 fleet was to replace all remaining R32s. The first R188s entered service on November 9, 2013. The R179 order fell significantly behind schedule, with first test train delivered in September 2016. On January 19, 2018, the MTA Board suggested that Kawasaki Rail Car Corp., a subsidiary of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, be awarded the $3.7 billion base order for the first 535 new R211 cars. The cars are anticipated to be delivered from 2020 to 2023, with the option orders to be delivered by 2025. The R211 base order includes 20 R211T cars with open gangways; 75 R211S cars for the Staten Island Railway, to be delivered near the end of the base order; and 440 cars similar to the R143/R160 series, operating in five-car units. The cars will be assembled at Kawasaki's factories in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Yonkers, New York. The first test train is expected to be delivered in December 2020, with the production cars being delivered between 2021 and 2023. Design and features The NTT models utilize a common car design; stainless- steel car bodies with a black front fascia on the \\"A\\" (cab) cars, open lexan- glass windows on non-cab ends allowing passengers to see through to the next car, and electronic outer route signs, as opposed to the rollsigns used by previous models. Improvements to the conductors' interface include the addition of speedometers as well as electronic consoles that monitor mechanical problems that may occur on the train. The cars feature a white fiberglass interior with blue-gray plastic bench seats both to combat vandalism, along with bright fluorescent lighting and LED interior passenger information signs. The bench-style seats, designed with lumbar supports, also replaced the unpopular bucket-style seats used on rolling stock built in the 1970s and '80s, which were both uncomfortable for passengers and hard to clean. The trains utilize an airbag suspension (replacing conventional springs) for a more comfortable ride, and employ regenerative braking which converts the energy from brake application into electricity that is fed back into the third rail. All NTT trains are capable of being equipped with communications-based train control (CBTC) technology, which is installed in the \\"A\\" cars behind the train operator's cab. Currently, only the R143s and R188s, as well as sixty-eight R160As, have been upgraded for automated service, on the and routes. Many, if not all of the remaining R160s will also be retrofitted with CBTC, as well as all existing cars in the R142 and R142A fleets and future cars in the R211 and R262 fleets. =Recorded announcements= The NTTs are the first rolling stock in the system to utilize pre-recorded train announcements, as opposed to live announcements from conductors. The recorded announcements are used for station information, closing doors, and other general messages. Station announcements rely on a wheel-rotation counter to make accurate stop announcements. The recordings began in the late 1990s and feature Bloomberg Radio on-air speakers, who volunteered at the request of their employer Michael Bloomberg, who would later become mayor of New York City. Voices include Diane Thompson (for the 1, 2, and 3 trains), Melissa Kleiner (original voice of the 4 and 5 trains outside of Manhattan), Jessica Ettinger Gottesman (current voice for the 4, 5, and 6 trains), Annie Bergen (for the 7 train and 42nd Street Shuttle), Catherine Cowdery (for the B, D, E, G, J, L, M, N, Q, R, (V discontinued), W, and Z trains), Kathleen Campion (for the A, C, and F trains, as well as the Franklin Avenue Shuttle and Rockaway Park Shuttle), and Charlie Pellett (for other announcements). Since 2018, Velina Mitchell has also done some of the announcements formerly performed by Pellett, particularly informational messages and station accessibility information. Female voices are typically used for station, route, and transfer/connection announcements, although Pellett announces the majority of the transfers on the A Division instead of the female voices. Pellett's recordings are used for most of the remaining announcements, most notably \\"Stand clear of the closing doors, please\\" before train doors closing, but also for safety announcements such as \\"Please be careful of the gap between the platform and the train\\" before entering a station with curved platforms, and \\"If you see something, say something.\\" With regards to why certain messages are voiced by males and others by females, MTA spokesperson Gene Sansone said in 2006, \\"Most of the orders are given by a male voice, while informational messages come from females. Even though this happened by accident, it is a lucky thing because a lot of psychologists agree that people are more receptive to orders from men and information from women.\\"AM New York (September 25, 2006): \\"Voices Down Below\\", by Justin Rocket Silverman Manual announcements can still be made over the public address system by train operators and conductors. In January 2020, as part of an agreement between the MTA and Comedy Central to promote actress Awkwafina's TV show Nora From Queens, the default pre-recorded announcements for the 7 train on the R188s were replaced with those from Awkwafina for one week. The announcements from Awkwafina featured jokes in addition to the standard station announcements. The agreement was the first time that the MTA has replaced train announcements as a form of advertising. =Electronic strip maps= The R142s, R142As, R143s, and R188s feature electronic \\"strip maps.\\" These maps utilize a total of 63 amber LED lights, numbered 001‚Äì063, to display stops, with a plastic card on top showing the route, stations, and transfers. A light will flash when a stop is being approached, and while idle at that stop. Lights turned off to indicate a stop already reached, or a part of the route not serviced on that particular trip. LED arrows at either end of the map indicate the direction of service. Electronic strip maps were first tested on the R110A and R110B in the 1990s. While an upgrade from static route maps, most of the strip maps can only facilitate one service and must be turned off when a train is used on another route; this problem is common on the 2 and 5 trains, which both use R142 cars based from the East 180th Street and 239th Street yards and have large amounts of route overlap on the IRT White Plains Road, Eastern Parkway, and Nostrand Avenue lines; the problem is also seen occasionally on the J/Z and L trains, which use R143 cars from the East New York yard that is shared by all three services. To solve this problem, the MTA began replacing the individual strip maps for cars assigned to these routes in 2016, with combined strip maps showing both services; the R143s would later be retrofitted with strip maps that also show all stops used by all three services beginning in late 2019. =FIND displays= The R160s and R179s, as well as the future R211s, employ an advanced alternative to strip maps, called the \\"Flexible Information and Notice Display,\\" or \\"FIND.\\" This includes an LCD screen displaying the route, route information, and advertisements, as well as a dynamic red, yellow, and green LED strip map that displays the next ten stations, plus five consecutive \\"further stops\\" to riders. There are three of these in every car. The display updates the stations at every stop, also giving the number of stops to each station listed. This allows for instant route or line changes with the correct information, which includes, but is not limited to, omitting certain stops (displayed as \\"Will not stop\\" in red). The FIND systems used on the R179s are slightly different from those used on the R160s. The LCD displays where the route's emblem is displayed are slightly larger than those on the R160s. If the FIND has gone blank, the R179 FIND displays \\"Route change: this map is not in use\\", as opposed to the R160 FIND, which displays \\"Listen to train crew for announcement.\\" The FIND system for the R211 will have multiple changes. The screen will display a map similar to the strip maps on the R142s, R142As, R143s, and R188s. It will have the ability to display more colors instead of just red, orange and green. When the train is at a station, two screens will be shown. The left side of the screen will display the station name, as well as the transfers and connections at that station (if there are any). The right side of the screen will show the stairs in the station and the train car the passenger is currently in (designated by the words ‚ÄúYou are here‚Äù). Incidents On June 21, 2006, an eight-car R143 train overshot the bumper at the end of the tracks in the Canarsie Yard. Leading car 8277 suffered significant damage and was stripped of damaged parts before being sent to the Kawasaki plant in Yonkers to receive repairs. The other cars in the set suffered minor body damage and were moved to the 207th Street Yard and repaired. By 2016, car 8277 was finally recoupled with 8278-8280. After Hurricane Sandy, R160B set 8738‚Äì8742 was damaged and required an extensive electrical reconstruction at Coney Island Shops. In March 2016, the set underwent pre-service testing and finally returned to service in fall 2016. On March 27, 2020, a northbound 2 train with R142 consists 6346-6350 and 6366-6370 caught fire while traveling from 96th Street to Central Park North‚Äì110th Street, killing the operator and injuring 16 others. The fire erupted on board car 6347, damaging that car, as well as causing additional fire and smoke damage to the rest of the set, which has been taken out of service. Since the delivery of the R179s, multiple issues have resulted in their removal from service. By the start of December 2018, some R179s had to be taken out of service due to manufacturing defects such as doors, propulsion, and air compressors issues. In early January 2019, NYCTA President Andy Byford ordered more newer R179 cars to be removed from passenger service and the temporary suspension of the delivery of further cars until Bombardier corrected all defects found within them. Deliveries recommenced in February 2019. On May 10, 2019, it was found that there is a welding defect on the collision pillars of the R179, but not all trains on property at the time were pulled from service. Between January 8 and January 24, 2020, all cars in revenue were taken out of passenger service due to raised concerns that train doors could malfunction while the trains were in service, and that doors could potentially open up when the train was in motion, all taking place on the C train. Most recently, the fleet was sidelined between June 3, 2020 and September 23, 2020 after a set of 5-car R179s on the A train had its link bar break in service at Chambers Street station, causing the consist to be split into two.

By early 1940, RAF commanders were concerned about mounting psychological casualties in Bomber Command and Coastal Command. A letter circulated to commands on 22 April 1940 recommended that squadron commanders identify men who had forfeited their confidence, distinguishing medical cases from those \\"lacking moral fibre\\". By the summer of 1940, senior commanders became concerned that medical officers were removing too many men from flying duty. More detailed guidance was given in the Memorandum on the Disposal of Members of Air Crews Who Forfeit the Confidence of Their Commanding Officers S.61141/S.7.C(1) issued on 28 September 1940, signed by Charles Evans, Principal Assistant Secretary for Personnel in the Air Ministry. This \\"LMF memorandum\\" was revised in 19 September 1941, 3 February 1943 and 1 March 1945. Under this procedure, aircrew refusing to fly operations were to be classified as (i) medically fit, (ii) medically unfit on nervous grounds (introduced in the 1941 revision) or (iii) medically unfit for other reasons. Aircrew would not be placed in the first two categories if they had been subject to \\"exceptional flying stress\\", and to be assigned to category (i), they \\"had to be proved to be lacking in moral fibre\\". From February 1943, aircrew on their second tour (30 operations in Bomber Command) could not be classified LMF, though commanders were urged not to publicize this provision. According to Wing Commander James Lawson, the Air Ministry officer who handled all cases under the Memorandum, 746 officers and 3,313 non-commissioned officers were referred. Of these, 2,726 cases (including 2,337 NCOs) were classified as LMF. A man classified in categories (i) or (ii) would lose his flying badge, \\"to prevent his getting a lucrative job as a pilot in civil life\\". The service records of those classified LMF were stamped with large red \\"W\\" (for \\"waverer\\"). Officers would lose their commissions and be refused ground jobs in the RAF, while NCOs would be reduced to aircraftman second class and assigned menial tasks, such as latrine duty, for at least three months. From 1944, men released as LMF could be called for the coal mines or drafted into the army. Contemporary opinion of the system was divided. Though severe, it was less harsh than a court martial. Senior commanders such as Air Vice-Marshals Keith Park (11 Group) and Arthur Harris (5 Group and later Bomber Command) considered it essential. Squadron commanders such as Leonard Cheshire viewed it as justified in a desperate situation. RAF psychiatrists, while acknowledging the deterrent effect, considered it harsh and deficient in failing to take account of individual situations. Many Commonwealth countries resented the application of this procedure to their personnel scattered throughout the RAF. Canadian Air-Vice Marshal Harold Edwards was particularly critical. As the end of the war approached, the LMF procedure became politically sensitive, and was officially dropped in 1945. However, the term remained in popular use in the RAF until the 1960s.

Stephens and Gough recorded some demos of their original songs with producer Mudd Wallace at Homestead Studios. Bass player Roe Butcher and drummer Paddy McNicholl joined the band and their demo tapes soon got the attention of Terri Hooley. Hooley signed the band to Good Vibrations and asked them to record an album for Good Vibrations. The band began recording with Mudd Wallace in 1980 and the sessions continued for two years. The music they developed in the studio blended country with punk and jazz influences, a style that was unusual for a Northern Irish scene dominated by urban punk bands like The Outcasts, Stiff Little Fingers and The Undertones. The Shamrocks played on an episode of BBC Television's \\"Rock Goes to College\\" with the Undertones at Queen's University Belfast. They also played concerts with Elvis Costello at the National Stadium in Dublin and with Joe Cocker, Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe at the Ulster Hall. For the most part, however, the Shamrocks played obscure clubs and bars in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles and during the Hunger Strike of 1981. As many bars and venues closed down during the Troubles, Northern Irish bands had to endure the paranoia and fear of entering \\"No-Go\\" areas like the Bogside in Derry to play in the remaining bars and clubs. In 1981 the Shamrocks' single \\"Condor Woman\\"/\\"Stand Up In Public\\" was released on Strong Records. In 1982 the album, under the working title \\"Potatoes Are a Virtue\\" was completed just as Good Vibrations had filed for bankruptcy. Terri Hooley tried to interest English and American labels such as EG and Warner Brothers in the album without success. Although the Shamrocks album was not released officially until nearly thirty years later, bootleg copies circulated on the Irish music scene in the '80's and '90's. The album took on a cult status and influenced Irish artists like Energy Orchard's Bap Kennedy, who called the Shamrocks his favorite Irish band and credited Mickey Stephens as an influence on his songwriting. Eventually the analog master tapes of the album were lost, but in 2011 a digital copy resurfaced and the album was finally released on Good Vibrations. The album was titled \\"Paddy\\" in honor of the Shamrocks' drummer Paddy McNicholl who died before the album was released. The Mighty Shamrocks toured Ireland in support of the release with Paddy's son Sam McNicholl on drums. The album received a five star review from Gavin Martin in Uncut Magazine and was hailed as a lost masterpiece of roots Americana in No Depression and PopMatters.

In the first round of sanctions, which were imposed in response to the Bosnian War, and lasted between April 1992 and October 1995, Yugoslavia was placed under a United Nations (UN) embargo. The embargo was lifted following the signing of the Dayton Agreement, which ended the conflict. During and after the Kosovo War of 1998‚Äì1999, Yugoslavia was again sanctioned by the UN, European Union (EU) and United States. Following the overthrow of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in October 2000, the sanctions against Yugoslavia started to be withdrawn, and most were lifted by 19 January 2001. The sanctions had a major impact on the Yugoslav economy and Yugoslav society, with Serbia the hardest hit, its GDP dropping from $24 billion in 1990 to below $10 billion in 1993, and $8.66 billion in 2000. They also had a devastating impact on Yugoslavian industry. Poverty was at its highest in 1993, with 39 percent of the population living on less than $2 per day. Poverty levels rose again when international sanctions were re-imposed in 1998. An estimated 300,000 people emigrated from Serbia in the 1990s, 20 percent of whom had a higher education. History On November 8, 1991, the European Economic Community imposed the first economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. The sanctions forbade the EEC's members from importing textiles from Yugoslavia and suspended an aggregate total of $1.9 billion in EEC aid packages which had been promised to Yugoslavia before twelve cease-fires failed to materialise in the Croatian war zone. On May 30, 1992, the United Nations Security Council passed UN SCR 757 by a 13‚Äì0 vote. It banned all international trade, scientific and technical cooperation, sports and cultural exchanges, air travel, and travel of government officials from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On the following day, President George H. W. Bush of the United States ordered the Department of Treasury to seize all US-based assets of the Yugoslav government, worth approximately $200 million at the time. French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand initially delayed the passing of Resolution 757 when he proposed that the sports ban be removed, but instead opted to keep the sports ban in exchange for written clarification that Serbian combatants were not solely responsible for the Yugoslav Wars. In spite of Mitterrand's amendment, Resolution 757 solely targeted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, not any of the breakaway states. On November 16, 1992, the UNSC passed Resolution 787, imposing a widespread ban on shipments to and from Yugoslavia. This Resolution was followed by a series of naval blockades, beginning with Operation Maritime Guard and later involving Operation Sharp Guard. The UNSC passed over a hundred resolutions over the course of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and some targeted Serbian entities outside of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Resolutions 820 and 942 specifically prohibited import-export exchanges and froze assets of Republika Srpska, at the time an unrecognized Serb statelet established by the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. When the Bosnian War ended, UN sanctions against Yugoslavia were lifted after the Bosnian elections on 14 September 1996. In spite of the lifting of UN sanctions, the United States maintained an \\"outer wall\\" of sanctions, preventing Yugoslavia from becoming a member of international institutions. A second series of international sanctions were imposed against Yugoslavia in 1998 when violence in Kosovo intensified. On March 31, 1998, the UNSC passed Resolution 1160, placing an arms embargo on Yugoslavia. These measures were followed by the European Union banning of JAT Yugoslav Airlines from flying to EU member states and the freezing of Yugoslav government assets in EU member states. On March 24, 1999, NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, and the United States and European Union enacted further trade and financial aid bans, including a ban on exporting oil to Yugoslavia. The European Union ended its sanctions on Yugoslavia on October 9, 2000, allowing EU members to share commercial flights and trade oil with Yugoslavia. Hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar under sanctions Shown above is a 500 billion Yugoslav dinar banknote printed in 1993. The first hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar lasted from 1992 to 1994. Starting from 1992, the Yugoslav dinar experienced a hyperinflation episode which lasted for a total of 25 months. In 1993, the dinar recorded a monthly inflation rate of 313 million percent. The hyperinflation reached a crescendo when the dinar's monthly inflation reached a staggering 5.578 quintrillion percent. During the peak of the hyperinflation January 1994, the Yugoslav government recruited Dragoslav Avramoviƒá, a former World Bank economist, as an economic adviser. On January 24, 1994, Avramoviƒá put in force a new Yugoslav dinar with a value ratio of 1:1 to that of the Deutsche mark. For several months afterwards, the dinar recorded virtually no inflation, and shortages of various necessities were noticeably reduced. As a result of the success of the new dinar, Avramoviƒá was named governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia on March 2, 1994. Avramoviƒá told The New York Times that he thought his fiscal program could be sustained in spite of the sanctions, saying the following: Economists disagreed whether hyperinflation could be avoided with the international sanctions. Ljubomir Madjar, an economist, was quoted in the same NYT article as saying the following: Avramoviƒá was voted out of the position in 1996 by the National Assembly of Yugoslavia. International sanctions were re-instated in 1998 due to the Kosovo War, and by 1999, the Yugoslav dinar had inflated to 30 times the value of a single deutsche mark. Effects on the people of Yugoslavia In 1989, the average income of inhabitants in Yugoslavia was approximately $3,000 per year. In October 1992, less than a year after the first sanctions were implemented, economist Miroljub Labus estimated that the average income at the time had fallen to approximately $1,500 per year. In September 1992, when gasoline was still available at some gas stations, a gallon sold for the equivalent of 15 US dollars. As a result of the oil and gas restrictions imposed by the sanctions, owners of private vehicles in Yugoslavia were allotted a ration 3.5 gallons of gasoline per month by October 1992. By November 1992, the state had begun selling public gas stations to individuals in hopes of circumventing the sanctions on fuel. The gas stations were sold to individuals with large amounts of money and street authority; paramilitary leader ≈Ωeljko \\"Arkan\\" Ra≈ænatoviƒá acquired several gas stations from the state at this time. As a result of the sanctions, many people stopped driving their cars. The public bus operator in Belgrade, GSP, no longer earned revenue since its fleet reduced due to lack of funding, which lead to overcrowding on buses after which tickets could no longer be collected from passengers. As a result, the safety GSP buses was gradually neglected, to the point in the late 1990s (after which sanctions had been re-introduced after the Kosovo insurgency started) where a passenger sitting over the one of the wheels on the bus fell through the rusted floor and was instantly killed.≈Ωivkoviƒá, Marko. Serbian Dreambook. Indiana University Press, 2011, p. 23. A CIA assessment on the sanctions filed in 1993 noted that \\"Serbs have become accustomed to periodical shortages, long lines in stores, cold homes in the winter and restrictions on electricity\\". Medicinal supplies in hospitals experienced shortages in antibiotics, vaccines, and anti-cancer drugs. In October 1993, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Belgrade estimated that approximately 3 million people living in Serbia and Montenegro were living at or below the poverty line. By late 1993, hospitals lacked basic antibiotics and functioning equipment such as X-ray devices. At this point gasoline stations had stopped providing fuel. In October 1993, in an attempt to conserve energy, the Yugoslav government began cutting off the heat and electricity throughout residential apartments. In November 1994, 87 patients died in Belgrade's Institute of Mental Health, which had no heat, food, or medicine. Patients in the hospital were reportedly walking around naked with little supervision. In May 1994, The New York Times reported that suicide rates had increased by 22% since sanctions were first implemented against Yugoslavia. In the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, the largest aluminium smelter in the region, KAP, stopped working after the implementation of sanctions. In 1993, the president of the Republic of Montenegro within Yugoslavia, Momir Bulatoviƒá, said that the sanctions were causing massive food shortages in Montenegro. Underground economy The implementation of sanctions corresponded with the emergence of an underground economy. Although there was no legal import of cigarettes during the sanctions, a market of low- quality and fake cigarettes, alcohol, and various street drugs took in its place. Although the sanctions included restrictions on gasoline, smugglers tried to profit by purchasing gas from across the Yugoslav border. Although some smugglers made large profits, the business was very risky, since they made their purchases in hard cash. In some cases they were an ideal target for various mafia groups, which could profit from killing smugglers and taking their cash intended to import gas into Yugoslavia. A former smuggler who was active in Montenegro during the sanctions, Zoran Ilinƒçiƒá, told Vijesti that at least 10 smugglers were killed on the borders of Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria by late 1992. As the existing banks experienced widespread closing, several pyramid schemes took place. Fraudulent banks, such as Jugoskandik and the infamous Darfiment Bank were set up by opportunistic criminals to lure people with extraordinary interest rates. Many people who fell for the pyramid banks were left homeless.

She was one of the first black public schoolteachers in Boston, and edited the Woman's Era, the country's first newspaper published by and for African-American women. Early life and education Florida Ruffin Ridley was born on January 29, 1861, to a distinguished Boston family. Her father, George Lewis Ruffin, was the first African-American graduate of Harvard Law School and the first black judge in the United States. Her mother, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, was a noted African-American writer, civil rights leader, and suffragist. The family lived on Charles Street in the West End. Ridley attended Boston public schools and graduated from Boston Teachers' College in 1882. She was the second African American to teach in the Boston public schools (the first was Elizabeth Smith, who taught at the Phillips School in the 1870s). She taught at the Grant School from 1880 until her marriage in 1888 to Ulysses A. Ridley, owner of a tailoring business in downtown Boston. The couple moved to Brookline, Massachusetts in 1896, where they may have been the town's first African-American homeowners. Ridley was one of the founders of the Second Unitarian Church in Brookline. She and her husband had a daughter, Constance, and a son, Ulysses A. Ridley, Jr. Activism Following in her mother's footsteps, Ridley became politically active as a young woman. She was involved in the early women's suffrage movement and was an anti-lynching activist. With her mother and Maria Louise Baldwin, Ridley co-founded several non-profit organizations. They founded the Woman's Era Club (later renamed the New Era Club), an advocacy group for black women, in 1894. In 1895 they founded a group that later became the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs; speakers at their first meeting included the abolitionist and religious leader, Eliza Ann Gardner, noted African- American scholar Anna J. Cooper, and Ella Smith, the first black woman to receive an M.A. from Wellesley College. In 1918, Ridley, Ruffin, and Baldwin founded the League of Women for Community Service. The League, which still exists today, provided social, educational, and charitable services for the black community. In 1923, Ridley conceived and directed an exhibit of \\"Negro Achievement and Abolition Memorials\\" at the Boston Public Library on behalf of the League. Ridley, who had a special interest in black history, also co- founded the Society for the Collection of Negro Folklore in 1890, and founded the Society of the Descendants of Early New England Negroes in the 1920s. Writing career As a journalist and essayist, Ridley wrote mainly about black history and race relations in New England. She contributed to the Journal of Negro History, The Boston Globe, and other periodicals, and also published a number of short stories. She was a member of the Saturday Evening Quill Club, a literary group organized by Boston Post editor and columnist Eugene Gordon in 1925. Fellow members included Pauline Hopkins and Dorothy West. The Saturday Evening Quill, the group's annual journal, published the work of African-American women writers and artists, including Ridley, Helene Johnson, and Lois Mailou Jones. Ridley also edited the Woman's Era, the country's first newspaper published by and for African-American women. She died at her daughter's home in Toledo, Ohio, on February 25, 1943. Her home on Charles Street is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.  Legacy  As of September 2020, the Florida Ruffin Ridley School in Coolidge Corner, Brookline, Massachusetts will be named in her honor.

Allen was one of the first black actors and performers to appear on television and stage in the United States, at a time when those venues were largely closed to African Americans. During the 1950s, Allen became one of the first black entertainers to have a recurring role on network television when she was cast on CBS' The Phil Silvers Show, beginning in 1955. She was one of the first African Americans to appear on television commercials in the U.S. She was also one of the earliest African American actors on daytime soap operas as she appeared in the mid-1950s as the character Ada Chandler on the popular daytime soap opera The Edge of Night. Allen assumed the character of Ada Chandler, after yet another Broadway veteran and groundbreaking actor Micki Grant left the role as the original character \\"Ada Chandler.\\" Allen was also known for her work on and off Broadway. Life and career Allen was born Wilhelmina Louise Allen on January 13, 1925, in Richmond, Virginia. Her father, William R. Allen, was an actuary, while her mother, the former Mamie Wimbush, was a teacher. Her interest in the performing arts, especially ballet and opera, began early in life. A fan of singer Marian Anderson, Allen attended her 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial after the Daughters of the American Revolution barred Anderson from performing at the DAR Constitution Hall. Allen attended the Hampton Institute, now known as present-day Hampton University. She then moved to New York City during the mid-1940s to pursue acting and dance. She was cast as a dancer in several Bradway productions early in her career, including the 1947 musical review Caribbean Carnival; a Broadway revival of Four Saints in Three Acts in 1952; and My Darlin' Aida, an adaptation of a Giuseppe Verdi opera, which also opened in 1952. She also appeared with one of her mentors, the legendary Ethel Waters in the revival of the off Broadway production of Mamba's Daughters. Allen was accepted into the Actors Studio, where she studied under the renowned acting teacher and actor Lee Strasberg. She was later cast as understudy in the part of \\"Beneatha Younger\\" in the 1959 Broadway premier production of playwright Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun. She later assumed the full-time role of \\"Beneatha Younger\\" when actress and friend Diana Sands exited the role. Allen befriended several members of the cast, notably actress Ruby Dee, with whom she shared a friendship that lasted over 55 years. She later directed her lifelong friend Ruby Dee in the 2001 off-Broadway dramatic play, Saint Lucy's Eyes which premiered at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York and was later staged and directed by Allen in the early 2000s at Atlanta, Georgia's Alliance Theatre. In 1960, Billie Allen portrayed a maid in the Broadway debut of Ira Levin's Critic's Choice. Her character \\"Essie\\" was the housekeeper of the play's main protagonist, theater critic \\"Parker Ballantine,\\" played by Henry Fonda, and his wife, portrayed by Georgann Johnson. She also appeared in James Baldwin's Blues for Mr. Charlie, a 1964 dramatic play loosely based on the killing of Emmett Till. Her last Broadway production as an actress was in A Teaspoon Every Four Hours in 1969. A Teaspoon Every Four Hours ran for a record 97 preview performances before closing the day after its official opening night. Aside from her breakthrough recurring role in The Phil Silvers Show on CBS during the 1950s, her other television roles included Car 54, Where Are You? on NBC in the early 1960s and Law & Order during the 1990s. Allen's film credits included Black Like Me in 1964, The Wiz in 1978, and Losing Ground in 1982. In 1973, Allen joined with actor and founder Garland Lee Thompson, Jr., actor Morgan Freeman and journalist Clayton Riley to establish the Frank Silvera Writers Workshop, located in Harlem, as a tribute to its namesake, Frank Silvera, a character actor, theater director and acting teacher. Notable students of the Frank Silvera Writers Workshop have included award-winning playwrights Charles Fuller, Ntozake Shange and Samm-Art Williams.https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/2/12/extensions- of-remarks-section/article/E208-3 By the early 1980s, Allen was established as an impeccable director, directing such edgy and provocative productions as Kathleen Collins's play The Brothers in 1982, Anna Deavere Smith's Aye, Aye, Aye, I'm Integrated in 1984, and the musical Miss Ethel Waters.https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/06/theater/theater-black-anguish-in- brothers.html http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-year-in- theatre-and-farewell-to-a-friend Allen received a Lucille Lortel Awards nomination in 2006 for directing Funnyhouse of a Negro, a ground-breaking one- act play by Adrienne Kennedy, in 2006. Allen had originated the role of the lead character \\"Sarah\\" during the play's debut in 1964. She was also awarded in 2006, The Rose McClendon Trailblazer Award from The Classical Theatre of Harlem. Billie Allen had been married twice. Her first marriage to aerospace engineer Duane H.

Youth Scouting was founded in the Philippines in 1910 in Manila by Elwood Stanley Brown (1883-1924) of the YMCA. The Boy Scouts of Calivo (now Kalibo in Aklan) was founded on April 22, 1922 by a certain Mr. Ong. The Boy Scouts of America Philippine Islands Council No. 545 was founded in 1923 in Manila by the Rotary Club of Manila. The Boy Scouts of the Philippines was legally established in 1936 in Manila through the work of three men: Josephus Emile Hamilton Stevenot (1888-1943), Tom√°s Confes√≥r y Valenzuela (1891-1951), and Manu√©l Lu√≠s Quezon y Molina (1878-1944), and the organization started activities in 1938.although the term \\"Boy Scouts of the Philippines\\" was first used by Theodore Roosevelt in 1911 and by Sir Robert Stephenson Baden-Powell in 1912. The 1973 celebration of the Golden Jubilee of Philippine Scouting and the Golden Jubilee Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines were dated from the establishment of the BSA Philippine Islands Council No. 545 in 1923, but the 2014 \\"Philippine Scouting Centennial Jamboree\\" commemorated the founding of the Lorillard Spencer Troop in 1914. In 1910, the first troops organised by Elwood Stanley Brown, Physical Director of the Manila YMCA.Cf: Official Handbook for Boys, first edition, published by Doubleday for the Boy Scouts of America, 1911. In 1912, Elwood Stanley Brown recognised by Baden-Powell as \\"Chief Scoutmaster.\\" In 1913, troops were organised by Mark Thompson, Antonio Torres, Domingo Ponce, and Francisco Varona. In 1914, the Lorillard Spencer Troop organised in November in Zamboanga City by Sherman L. Kiser. In 1921, Scouting started at Silliman Institute under the auspices of its church. They applied for registration to BSA National Headquarters, New York, in 1922, and received their document in January 1923 (some eight or nine months before the creation of the BSA Philippine Islands Council No. 545). On April 19, 1922, a certain Mr. Ong of Calivo, Capiz (now Kalibo, Aklan) organized the Boy Scouts of Calivo which the Governor General Leonard Wood at that time acknowledged in his letter dated January 2, 1923. https://m.facebook.com/TheAkeanon/photos/a.1719615118260228/2396511890570544/?type=3 In 1923, the Rotary Club established the Boy Scouts of America Philippine Islands Council No. 545 in October. In 1931, experimentation was conducted in both Sea Scouting and Cub Scouting. In 1933, the Philippines made first participation in an international Scout event, with the BSA Philippine Islands Council delegation embedded in the BSA contingent to the 4th World Scout Jamboree in Budapest, Hungary. In 1934, Rover Scouting was introduced. The BSA Shanghai District was placed under the supervision of the BSA Philippine Islands Council No. 545. In 1936, the Boy Scouts of the Philippines was established by a legislative act. The first BSP President and Chief Scout was Josephus Stevenot. In 1937, the BSA Philippine Islands Council No. 545, meeting in October, decided on the handover of its properties and responsibilities to the nascent BSP. In 1938, the BSP was inaugurated by Pres. Manuel Quezon on January 1, and started functioning. Exequi√©l Villacorta was appointed the first \\"Chief Scout Executive\\" of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, in imitation of the BSA Chief Scout Executive. In 1947, the BSP made its first participation in an international event, with the BSP contingent to the 6th World Scout Jamboree in Moisson, France. In 1953, the first Wood Badge course was conducted at BSP Camp Gre-Zar in Novaliches, Quezon City. In 1954, the first BSP National Scout Jamboree was held at Rolling Hills, Balar√¢, Quezon City. Dr. Mariano Villarama de los Santos served on the World Scout Committee from 1957 until 1959. In 1959, the 10th World Scout Jamboree was held at the National Scout Reservation, University of the Philippines, Los Ba√±os, at the foot of Mount Makiling, in the province of Laguna. This was the first World Scout Jamboree outside Europe and Canada. In 1960, the Cub Scout program was revised to replace American symbols (e.g. Bobcat, Bear Cub, Wolf Cub, Lion Cub) with Philippine motifs (e.g. Kawan, Mother Usa, Chief Usa, Young Usa, Lauan, Molave, Narra, Leaping Usa). In 1961, the Boy Scout program was revised to replace American symbols (e.g. Eagle) with Philippine motifs (e.g. Maginoo,\\"Maginoo\\": Gentlemanly. Jose Rizal). In 1963, 24 members of the BSP delegation to the 11th World Scout Jamboree in Marathon, Greece, died in a plane crash in the sea off the coast of Mumbai, India. Streets in the South Triangle District of Quezon City were later named in their memory. In 1968, Boy Scouts, Rovers, and Scouters joined in the search-and-rescue operations for victims of the Ruby Tower collapse in August. For the services rendered by the Scouts, the BSP organization was awarded by President Ferdinand Marcos with a Presidential Gold Medal the following year. In 1970, Senior Scouting officially launched as part of the BSP program. It has three sections: Air (grey uniform), Land (dark green), and Sea (white). In 1971, Ambassador Antonio C. Delgado was elected Chairman of the World Scout Conference, becoming the first Filipino to hold this position. In 1972, BSP membership hit the one-million mark. In 1973, the Golden Jubilee Jamboree and first Asia-Pacific Jamboree was held at the National Scout Reservation, University of the Philippines, Los Ba√±os, Laguna. The jamboree song, \\"Kapatirang Paglilingkod,\\" reflected the Bagong Lipunan regime of President Ferdinand Marcos. In 1974‚Äì75, the Cub Scout name is Philippinised: the Pilipino alphabet at that time did not include the letter C, so \\"Cub\\" was replaced with \\"Kab.\\" However, since \\"kab\\" was not actually a Pilipino word, it was contrived as an acronym for \\"Kabataan Alay sa Bayan\\" and written in all caps. In 1975‚Äì86, in compliance with the orders of Pres. Marcos, the Boy Scouts of the Philippines was renamed \\"Kapatirang Scout ng Pilipinas\\" (literally meaning Scout Brotherhood of the Philippines). The Scout age groups were reduced from four to two. The Scout Oath and Scout Law were revised. A new Scout badge was devised. President Ferdinand Marcos took the title of Chief Scout, the first Philippine head of state to hold the title. In 1986, the Golden Jubilee of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (1936‚Äì86). In the aftermath of the People Power Revolution, the name Kapatirang Scout ng Pilipinas was abandoned and the organization reverted to its original name \\"Boy Scouts of the Philippines.\\" In 1990‚Äì91, a program was created for pre- school boys and named KID Scouting. Since \\"kid\\" is English and not Filipino, it was contrived as an acronym for \\"Kabataang Iminumulat Diwa\\" and written in all caps. In 1991, the 12th Asia-Pacific Jamboree was held at Philippine Scouting Center, University of the Philippines, Los Ba√±os, Laguna. In 1992, the old BSP badge was reinstated. In 1993, the Philippines hosted the first ASEAN Scout Jamboree. In 1997, the 2nd World Scout Parliamentary Union held in Manila. In 1999, the first Venture Scout Jamboree was held on Ilian Hills, Iriga City, Camarines Sur, Bicol. In 2007, the BSP observed the world centennial of the Scout Movement. In 2009‚Äì10, the BSP hosted the 26th Asia- Pacific Jamboree, 28 December 2009 ‚Äì 3 January 2010. This was the third APR Jamboree in the Philippines.

It was founded in 1851 by 24 citizens of New York who were concerned about growing numbers of street children in New York.The 24 incorporators were Robert B. Minturn, Myndert Van Schaick, Robert M. Stratton, Solomon Jenner, Albert Gilbert, Stewart Brown, Francis R. Tillou, David S. Kennedy, Joseph B. Collins, Benjamin F. Butler, Isaac T. Hopper, Charles Partridge, Luther Bradish, Christopher Y. Wemple, Charles O'Conor, John D. Russ, John Duer, Peter Cooper, Apollos R. Wetmore, Frederick S. Winston, James Kelly, Silas C. Herring, Rensselaer N. Havens, and John W. Edmonds. The necessity for such an institution was first proposed by the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, which helped to get it started. Purpose Hundreds of homeless and runaway children were present on the streets of New York at the time, and many of them were arrested every year. As part of its mission \\"to care for, train, and morally uplift a mixed group of the City's poor children,\\" the New York Juvenile Asylum provided housing, education, and reform for those children, and eventually placed them in apprenticeships. It provided a non- punitive alternative for children who had been arrested, and taught disobedient or unoccupied children \\"self-discipline of body, mind, and heart.\\" In its earliest days it was not particularly effective, and became primarily a place to house disruptive children., p.780 The mission and purpose of the Children's Village has evolved from its origins in the 1800s, and it now exists to \\"work in partnership with families to help society's most vulnerable children so that they become educationally proficient, economically productive, and socially responsible members of their communities.\\" History The original charter for the school was drafted in 1850. After some initial fundraising difficulties, the school was opened in a rented building on January 10, 1853. Early on, the asylum was able to house 400 students, who received six hours of schooling a day, plus other types of instruction, such as vocational education. The school also participated in the orphan train program, placing students with families throughout the Midwest, notably Illinois. Amsterdam Avenue and 176th Street, Ca 1890 In 1854 property was purchased in Washington Heights. This property consisted of 23 acres, and later expanded to 29. This campus had 1,200 beds, although it averaged 582 children per year between 1871 and 1879. The original plan called for two separate facilities: a House of Reception where children would be initially sent by authorities and would be fed, bathed, and housed, while an investigation occurred to determine if there were family who would care for them, and the Asylum, where students would be housed long-term. A massive building of blue granite was constructed on 175th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, and opened in 1856. It was described as being \\"somewhat too prison- like in appearance.\\" An 1860 New York Times article said, \\"It has a front of 150 feet, two wings, each 75 feet in length and 46 in breadth, and a central extension, 82 feet deep and 43 feet in width. A brick wall incloses play- grounds for both sexes.\\" Children were committed to the asylum for a variety of reasons, and included children whose parents were incarcerated, whose parents considered them to be \\"bad\\" and beyond their control, who had been sustaining themselves by begging, and who were truants, homeless, or thieves. The asylum was designed to provide such children a home, not to be a prison. The facility was racially integrated in 1860. In 1901, in the face of rising property values, the Washington Heights site was sold and 277 acres were purchased in Dobbs Ferry, New York, in Westchester County. The new location was intended to be more homelike than the granite building in Washington Heights had been. Instead of dormitories housing 50‚Äì75 students, it featured cottages arranged around a central quad. At one point there were more than 40 buildings, including not only cottages and classroom buildings, but also workshops and a printing shop. This design won a gold medal for architecture at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. The new facility was designed to be a therapeutic community. The number of children housed and cared for was reduced from an average of 582 per year between 1871 and 1879 to 300 in the new facility, where living arrangements were modeled on typical family life; married couples lived with and cared for the children. It was at this time that the facility was renamed \\"The Children's Village\\". Children did not stay at the facility indefinitely; after 6‚Äì12 months they were returned to their families or placed in foster care. There was a new focus on mental health and social work in the 1920s, with the Children's Village becoming the first residential treatment center in the country to have an on-site psychiatric clinic and a social work training school. The New York Juvenile Asylum and its later incarnation, the Children's Village, saw much success and praise, with many students going on to lead successful lives.A Chicago Tribune obituary from November 10, 1880, reprinted on page 18 of the Children's Village's 1881 annual report notes that Peter Walsh, a \\"New York waif\\" who \\"knew neither father nor mother\\" had been sent out west by the New York Juvenile Asylum and been adopted by Dr. Porter. He went on to attend the Law School of Ann Arbor, and served for many years as the Chicago City Attorney and prosecuting attorney. However, the Children's Village also saw criticism for its institutional model, artificial environment, and practice of mixing \\"virtuous\\" children from broken homes with children who had been arrested for criminal activity. In the 1970s and 1980s the racial makeup of the Children's Asylum shifted, with an increasing proportion of African-American students. The median age dropped to 12, and students remained at the facility longer, often for several years. In the 1990s there was a rise in opposition to residential and institutional facilities nationwide. Many were forced to close. The Children's Village saw its funding, both from government and from private donors, decrease, and it had to tap into its endowment to remain afloat. The Children's Village revamped its treatment procedures in light of increased criticism of the residential model. There was an increased focus on treating children's behavioral and emotional problems and preparing them for reintegration with either their families and communities, or a foster home. This re-vamped model resulted in increased funding, both governmental and by private donors, and allowed the Children's Village to increase the number of children it was able to help per year from 5,000 under the old model, to 10,000 in the new one. Services As of 2015, the Children's Village serves over 10,000 children per year. 425 students are accommodated in the residential school at Dobb's Ferry. It also provides services to children in areas such as: *Immigration services *Foster care *Family preservation *Short- term shelters and housing *Community outreach programs *A multi-generational community center *Summer camps *Affordable housing *Crisis services *Day students *Daycare References Explanatory notes Citations External links * Category:Greenburgh, New York Category:Schools in Westchester County, New York Category:Educational institutions established in 1851 Category:1851 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Children's Village (New York)"},{"id":"49244956","text":"Steven Lloyd Welch is an American Christian musician, worship leader, and pastor, who primarily plays Christian pop and contemporary worship music.

The documentary follows the journey of Steve Mazan, a stand up comedian with the lifelong dream of performing a comedy routine on the Late Show with David Letterman. However, Mazan's quest takes a turn when he is diagnosed with inoperable liver cancer, and informed he may only have five years to live. The film follows his decision to spend what time he has left chasing his dream to perform on Letterman's stage. Dying to Do Letterman also looks at the historic impact David Letterman had on the comedy world. Notable appearances in the documentary include Ray Romano, Kevin Nealon, Jim Gaffigan, Brian Regan, Arj Barker, Will Durst and Robert Schimmel. Mazan acted as narrator for the film, speaking directly into camera from behind a large microphone on an empty comedy stage. The film won numerous audience and grand jury awards on the film festival circuit, and was invited by the International Documentary Association to qualify for Academy Award consideration through the 2011 DocuWeeks program. The film's Kickstarter for an Oscar crowdfunding campaign also received press attention, as reported by Indiewire, who noted the Kickstarter project for Dying to Do Letterman raised $20,000 in just two days. After a theatrical release through the 2011 DocuWeeks program, Dying to Do Letterman was acquired for distribution by Oscilloscope Laboratories. Of the film's premise, The Chicago Daily Herald said, \\"There's nothing like a little incurable cancer to kick-start someone's attempt to fulfill a lifelong dream.\\"  Synopsis  Late Show with David Letterman, filmed at the Ed Sullivan Theater The film begins on an empty comedy stage with a large microphone. Steve Mazan enters and speaks directly into camera. This narrative device is used throughout the film. Mazan explains that since he was a young boy, he dreamed of performing on David Letterman's show. He became a professional stand-up comedian, and performed shows around the country in hopes of one day making it to the Ed Sullivan Theater where the Late Show with David Letterman was taped before a live studio audience. He then learns he has cancer, and may only have five years to live. His girlfriend at the time, Denise, is shocked by the news, but the couple makes the decision to get married. Together, they also decide that Steve should spend the time he has left pursuing his dream of performing on Letterman's show. Mazan launches his Dying to Do Letterman campaign, asking people to email the Late Show with David Letterman staff with the subject line \\"Book Mazan.\\" Hundreds of emails are sent on Mazan's behalf. He receives a letter from an executive producer of The Late Show. The letter states that many sick people with emotional stories write to the show and ask to appear in an episode, but as a policy they cannot honor such requests. Undeterred, Steve decides to perform more comedy shows, write new material, and seek advice from professional comedians who have appeared on Letterman. As the film progresses, Steve sits down with numerous comedians who are veterans of David Letterman's show. These include Ray Romano, Kevin Nealon, Jim Gaffigan, Brian Regan, Arj Barker, and Will Durst. The conversations cover why Letterman was so important to them, and explore how the comedians achieved their first appearance on Letterman's stage. The comics also offer advice to Mazan on his quest. Interspersed with the comedian interviews and Mazan's writing process are scenes tracking Mazan's health. His cancer is growing slowly, but Mazan is informed that the tumors on his liver could quickly accelerate their growth at any time, which would likely lead to his death. During this process, Mazan manages to send a DVD of his act to Letterman's booker, Eddie Brill. Brill likes Steve but thinks his material is wrong. He offers Mazan advice on how to tweak his act for the show, but makes no promises about booking him. Mazan continues to write and test new material. The process includes a trip to Iraq where Mazan performs for American troops. During the performance, the base is bombed. Cameras catch Mazan and the comedy show audience running through the night as an ammunition dump explodes behind them, but Mazan escapes unharmed. He jokes that \\"it's not just cancer that can kill you.\\" He continues to send off new material to Letterman's booker, Brill. Despite many submissions, several years pass and Mazan receives no communication from the show. He begins to believe that he won't be booked, and decides it may be time to give up on his Letterman dream. At that time Mazan sits down with another comedian diagnosed with cancer, Robert Schimmel. Schimmel encourages Steve to continue his journey and keep chasing his dream. A title card then informs viewers that Schimmel died shortly thereafter. Mazan makes a final audition DVD for Letterman's show and sends it off. Letterman's booker Eddie Brill likes the DVD and wants to book Mazan. However, comedians are often cancelled at the last minute, and Mazan won't know if he will perform until right before showtime. The film ends as Mazan takes the Letterman stage. Title cards inform viewers that on September 4, 2009, Mazan performed on the Letterman show. He received five applause breaks, and his sickness was never mentioned. A quick shot of Mazan then reveals that he is still alive and healthy. Over the final credits the film shows a montage of Mazan practicing his final routine at comedy clubs intercut with the actual Letterman performance. The routine centers on key cards that become demagnetized, and the frustrations of being locked out of one's hotel room.  Narration style  For the narration of Dying to Do Letterman, Mazan delivers his backstory and commentary from a stage in an empty comedy club. Mazan speaks directly into camera. He also occasionally interacts with props such as a ticking clock and a running hourglass. Of the device, The Plain Dealer said: > You know you're in for a weird and wonderful ride when a little more than > nine minutes into the story of Steve Mazan's quest to make it onto the \\"Late > Show With David Letterman,\\" the comic busts out his \\"Top 10 Benefits of > Catching Cancer\\" (3. Blame hair loss on chemotherapy rather than on male > pattern baldness.) Internet Reviews said, \\"Steve is not only funny, he is a really likable guy, which comes through in spades in the very insightful narration he does for his life story.\\" Screen Comment felt the narration device was unnecessary.  Production  David Letterman in 2012 Dying to Do Letterman was self-funded by directors Biagio Messina and Joke Fincioen, who invested their life savings making the film. The entire production took five years. Footage for the film was acquired between 2006 and 2009. Editing took place throughout the filming, and was completed in 2011. = Development = In 2005, Mazan learned he had cancer, and said after he went through the stages of grief, he decided he'd like to launch a campaign to perform on Letterman's show. As depicted in the film, Mazan launched the original Dying to Do Letterman site, and began shooting videos of himself discussing his quest in early 2006. = Pre- production = Deciding he'd like to fully document his journey, Mazan connected with Joke Fincioen and Biagio Messina, a married, filmmaking and TV producing duo. They had edited a comedy reel for Mazan in 2003. Since the filmmakers also considered Mazan a friend, they were concerned about making a documentary following his story. Fincioen warned that if the journey did not go as planned, or if Mazan fell on bad times, they could not put the camera down and stop filming. Of the potential filmmaking/friendship conflict, Screen Comment said: \\"Fincioen and Messina generally refrain from lionizing Mazan's predicament, a considerable achievement given that both are close friends with him. They are not afraid to show his stubborn and mopey side, or the effect that his single-mindedness has on Denise.\\" In an interview with MovieMaker Magazine Messina stated that Mazan's only creative input before filming was, \\"Even if I die, you have to finish the documentary and still make it funny. I don't want to make a depressing cancer movie.\\" Of the story, Messina said he felt the documentary had to present two concepts in order for the story to work: > On our own documentary Dying to do Letterman, there are two hooks. 1. A man > chases his life-long dream of performing on the David Letterman show. 2. He > learns he only has five years to live. Either hook on its own is really not > enough to carry the film. Combined, they made for a much deeper movie: When > a man learns he only has five years to live, he dedicates his life to living > his dream of performing on Letterman. As they prepared for more in-depth filming, the entire team began reaching out to bookers and comedians who might be able to help with Mazan's quest. = Production = Much of the footage was personally filmed by Mazan on small camcorders. The filmmakers built a mock comedy club which was used for Mazan's narration. It was designed by Elvis Strange. To save money, the filmmakers recorded most of the interviews on a $15 clip-on microphone purchased at Radio Shack. = Post-production = Messina and Fincioen edited the film together from 300 hours of footage they had captured over the years. Music was provided by Dave Pelman Music.  Marketing  The filmmakers used a variety of grassroots techniques to promote the film, including both real-world and virtual approaches. = Street team = Mazan, Messina, Fincioen, and volunteers visited film festivals dressed in hospital scrubs while passing out flyers for Dying to Do Letterman. They also passed out buttons which read, \\"I'm Dying To ...\\" followed by a blank space. Festival goers were encouraged to share their own dreams with the street team. The filmmakers would then write those dreams on the buttons with a marker, and the pin it on the people sharing their dreams. The technique was cited as winning them fans in several cities. The filmmakers posted photos and videos of the buttons with others' dreams featured on them as part of their online campaign. Actor Michael Rooker (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Walking Dead, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer) joined the street team in San Jose to help promote the film at its world premiere, part of the Cinequest Film Festival. = Kickstarter campaign = Once Dying to Do Letterman was invited to participate in DocuWeeks by the International Documentary Association, the filmmakers launched a Kickstarter campaign to help cover their costs and thus qualify for Academy Award consideration. Dubbed Kickstarter for an Oscar the campaign set out to raise $37,000 to pay for promotion, travel, and screenings related to the expenses of participating in DocuWeeks. According to TheWrap: \\"For an independent documentary, qualifying for the Academy Awards isn't easy, or cheap. But one of this year's hopefuls has found a new way to raise money: a crowd-funding campaign based on the simple plea, \\"Help us qualify for an Academy Award.\\" Michael Lumpkin, executive director of the International Documentary Association, said of the Kickstarter Campaign: \\"[It] shows the filmmaking community how to successfully use some of these new online tools to raise money for documentary films.\\" The campaign raised a total of $57,569 from 614 backers. Of the Kickstarter project, Indiewire highlighted the fact that Dying to do Letterman raised $20,000 in just two days. = Charity screenings and events = Mazan and filmmakers stated that using the film to support cancer research and patients in some way was important to them. Before the Dying to do Letterman world premiere in San Jose at the Cinequest Film Festival, Mazan headlined a comedy show benefiting the Canary Foundation at the San Jose Improv. Actor Michael Rooker joined in promoting the event in a video hosted by both Rooker and Mazan. At the Kahbang Film Festival, August 9, 2011, Dying to do Letterman played as the closing night film, with all proceeds going to benefit the Champion the Cure Challenge. On August 11, 2011, a charity screening of Dying to do Letterman was held to benefit Team Lucy, a group put together to support 4-year-old Lucy Weber, a Bloomington, Illinois girl being treated for leukemia. The filmmakers stated the event raised $8000 for the Webers. Dying to Do Letterman also played as part of the 2012 Gilda's Laughfest, a film festival that promotes healing through comedy.  Release  Dying to Do Letterman had its world premiere in San Jose at the Cinequest Film Festival on Friday, March 4, 2011. It received a theatrical release through the 2011 DocuWeeks program. Its New York premiere was August 26, 2011 at The IFC Center. In Los Angeles, it premiered September 2, 2011 at the Laemmle Sunset 5. Oscilloscope Laboratories acquired the film for distribution on home video platforms in North America. On December 7, 2012, it was released on iTunes, and was named New and Noteworthy along with films including The Dark Knight Rises, Beasts of the Southern Wild, and Brave. On May 13, 2015, the film was released on Hulu.  Reception  In 2011 Dying to Do Letterman played in a variety of film festivals and was reviewed in numerous outlets before it was acquired for distribution by Oscilloscope Laboratories. It had its world premiere at the Cinequest Film Festival, where it won both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary. = Film festivals and awards = Cinequest Film Festival *Grand Jury Prize, Best Documentary *Audience Award, Best Documentary Cleveland International Film Festival *Winner, Greg Gund Memorial Standing Up Film Competition Carmel Art and Film Festival *Jury Prize, Best Documentary Los Angeles New Wave International Film Festival *Honorable Mention, Best Documentary Just for Laughs Comedy Film Festival *Honorable Mention, Best Comedy Kahbang Film Festival *Audience Award, Best Film Naples International Film Festival *Neapolitan Media Award Heartland Film Festival *Official Selection St. Louis Film Festival *Official Selection Great American Comedy Festival *Featured Film DocuWeeks Invited to qualify for Academy Award consideration by the International Documentary Association. = Audience reaction = The filmmakers posted videos showing multiple standing ovations after screenings, and interviewing audience members as they exited theaters. = Reviews = Cleveland's The Plain Dealer said of Dying to Do Letterman, \\"...a nimble, uplifting film that celebrates life, love and friendship. Best of all, it's a riot.\\" Variety wrote \\"Like its regular-guy subject, the pic proves more endearing than hilarious\\" and said that scenes in the film provided a \\"worthy curtain-peeling dimension.\\" Film School Rejects wrote: \\"[Dying to do Letterman] does a solid job of weaving elements of Mazan's personal life together with his quest, and it becomes a humorous and occasionally heartbreaking reminder that the journey is more important than the destination. Cliched? Sure, but it works as more than just a simple tale about trying to triumph over cancer.

Comedy publication Splitsider called it, \\"an exceptionally compelling story, with a twisting and sometimes heartbreaking narrative.\\" Nearly six years after Mazan's performance, as Letterman neared his final episode of The Late Show, Donald Liebenson writing for The Huffington Post discussed Dying to do Letterman, and called Mazan's Letterman debut, \\"...one of the most triumphant moments during Dave's 33-year tenure.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:2011 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Documentary films about comedy and comedians Category:Documentary films about cancer Category:American independent films Category:American documentary films Category:2011 documentary films Comedy Comedy ","title":"Dying to Do Letterman"},{"id":"49245003","text":"Barkow may refer to: People *Al Barkow (born 1932), American journalist. *Ben Barkow (born 1956), British librarian. *Frank Barkow (born 1957), American architect. *Jerome H.

The work portrays six trees along a riverbank, a metaphor for the principled seclusion of virtuous gentlemen in an era of violent upheaval and foreign occupation. As the first of Ni Zan‚Äôs paintings to demonstrate the stark, minimalist style for which he is known, Six Gentlemen marked a turning point in his artistic career. He would frequently return to its subject matter in later years, producing many subsequent works of nearly identical composition and style.  Description  Ni Zan painted Six Gentlemen while visiting his friend, the art collector Lu Heng, in the spring of 1345. Ni‚Äôs inscription explains that he arrived by boat at Lu‚Äôs house on May 10, and that Lu immediately brought paper and asked him to paint something for him (a request he made whenever the two of them met). Though tired, Ni Zan obliged and produced the painting by the light of a lamp. The result was a sparse landscape in which six old trees stand on a small bank in the lower foreground, across an expanse of water from some distant hills in the background. Ni Zan‚Äôs inscription suggests that ‚Äúold master Dachi‚Äù, the respected elder artist Huang Gongwang, would laugh when he saw the painting. It is accompanied by a second inscription by Huang himself, who was also a guest at Lu Heng‚Äôs house at the time, and examined the painting soon after it was made. It is from Huang‚Äôs inscription that the painting receives its name, Six Gentlemen: > Distant cloudy mountains range across the autumn river; Nearby, ancient > trees huddle by the sloping shore. Six gentlemen stand facing one another, > Upright, straight, outstanding, unbending. Another inscription, possibly by a different guest at Lu Heng‚Äôs house, volunteers its author as a model if Ni Zan should ever decide to add a fisherman to his painting later. The final inscription, added after Huang‚Äôs death, remarks that he and Ni Zan will live on in the form of the painting.  Analysis  The starkly barren landscape depicted in Six Gentlemen might represent Ni Zan's feelings about recent upheavals in the region around his home in Wuxi. The devastating Yellow River flood of the previous year displaced many people in the area, and gave rise to banditry and peasant rebellions. The composition and brushwork of Six Gentlemen are simpler compared to Ni Zan‚Äôs earlier paintings, such as Enjoying the Wilderness in an Autumn Grove (1339) and Water and Bamboo Dwelling (1343), which had been influenced by the styles of Dong Yuan and Zhao Mengfu. Ni's later approach to landscape painting was expressed by his statement that \\"what I call painting is no more than free brushwork done sketchily\\" and that \\"I never seek representative likeness since I paint only for my own amusement\\". The austerity of Ni's brushwork is also thought to be connected to his reputed obsession with cleanliness and purity. The visual isolation of the ‚Äúsix gentlemen‚Äù in the painting may reflect the attitude of intellectuals like Ni who preferred to live a life of seclusion in the countryside rather than serve as government officials under the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, which had conquered the native Chinese Song dynasty. This theme is suggested by Huang‚Äôs inscription, which may be referring to the likeminded individuals gathered in Lu Heng‚Äôs house when Ni Zan painted Six Gentlemen, or to the ‚Äúsix gentlemen‚Äù of the Song dynasty, a group of officials who were purged from the government for their views. The importance of individual expression (both political and aesthetic), and the rejection of realistic detail, are major themes in late Yuan dynasty literati painting.  Similar works  Six Gentlemen marks the genesis of Ni's personal style. His subsequent landscapes usually follow the same pattern: minimal compositions with a few trees, low mountains across a lake or river, occasionally an empty hut, and no human figures. Examples from Ni's later years include Empty Pavilion in a Pine Grove (1354), Wind among the Trees on the Riverbank (1363, painted after his wife's death), The Rongxi Studio (1372), and Woods and Valleys of Mount Yu (also 1372). This style was also frequently imitated by later artists, who took Ni and the other literati painters of the Yuan dynasty as archaic models to emulate.

As is the case in traditional injection molding, multi material injection molding uses materials that are at or near their melting point so that the semi-liquidous (viscous) material can fill voids and cavities within a pre-machined mold, thus taking on the desired shape of designed tooling. In general, advantages of MMM over other production techniques include, but are not limited to, creating parts that have an elastic modulus that varies with location on the part (different regional polymer hardness), creating a single-structure part with different regional materials (similar to the previous advantage, but more focused on joining different types of polymers like rubber and plastic), and also creating a single part with multiple independent polymer colors. Applications range from simple household items like a toothbrush to more heavy duty construction of items like power tools. The three most widely used methods of MMM fabrication are: * multi-component * multi-shot * over-molding Each MMM primary subset can also be further subdivided into secondary and tertiary subsets, and even further in some cases. This can be advantageous when fine tuning or other general calibration of a specific MMM process is desired. Each primary subset is outlined further in the following sections.  Multi- component injection molding  Co- Injection Molding Process Battenfield three-channel MMM technique used for MMM of three materials at one time Also referred to as co-injection molding, multi-component injection molding describes insertion of multiple viscous materials injected simultaneously, as opposed to placing one material as an additional layer relative to another. In other words, it creates a sandwich-like structure where both materials mold around each other as dissimilar liquids, and exist in such a state at the same time. Relative to the part center, materials can be injected concentrically using the same mold/gate, or regionally using gates at different locations.  Multi-shot injection molding (MSM)  Also referred to as sequential injection molding, multi-shot injection molding refers to creation of multiple layers relative to the starting axis of the initial mold. In other words, the warm, heated materials are inserted into the mold in a very specific sequence one after another. This creates a layering effect between materials while maintaining relatively high-energy interactions at material boundaries. This is important because it implies that the inter-layer bonds are stronger in many cases than when the layers are applied to a previously cooled part, as is more closely the case of over molding. While there are other applications, this operation is preferred when varying molds (different geometries) are desired between material layers.  Over-molding  Over molding is effectively the use of layering effects in polymer application techniques. This process is centered around the use of a liquidous resin to add additional layers of shape and structure to an existing component. An example of such a resin could be a polymer that has been heated to a temperature just above its glass transition temperature). The existing component to which the resin is being added is often injection molded as well, and may be near its own glass transition temperature. This process works well when layers with varying geometric profiles are desired around a central \\"core\\" structure.  Benefits  If the desired object is manufacturable using MMM, it is definitely best to use MMM over traditional injection molding. Some of the key features that makes MMM a better approach are as followed: * lower cost * higher-quality product * significant reduction in assembly operations * reduction in cycle times  References  Category:Injection molding ","title":"Multi-material injection molding"},{"id":"49245438","text":"Jo Wilson may refer to: * Jo Karev, previously Wilson, a fictional character from the television series Grey's Anatomy * Jo Wilson (presenter), Scottish television presenter * Jo Wilson (footballer) ","title":"Jo Wilson"},{"id":"49245440","text":"Mejlen or Asylet B√∏rnely is a house, former asylum and a listed building in Aarhus, Denmark. The house was built in 1768 and was listed in the national Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 8 November 2008. The building originally functioned as a kindergarten but is today home to an art gallery.  History  In the 1880s Aarhus experienced rapid growth and the population ballooned from 6.000 people in 1850 to 50.000 in 1900. The large number of new inhabitants made it necessary to provide daycare for children of the working class. The kindergarten was commissioned by the religious charitable organization Stefansforeningen and was paid for by charitable contributions and fundraisers. On 10 March 1883 an editorial in √Örhus Stiftstidende invited people to donate and on 9 April 1883 a list of contributors was published. The building was designed to house 100 children and it was constructed in 1883 by architect Carl Lange. Originally the institution was simply called Asylet (English: The Asylum), which at the time meant kindergarten, but it was quickly changed to Stefansforeningens B√∏rnely or colloquially just B√∏rnely. The institution was managed by a number of deacons from Stefansforeningen which also used the building for religious children's services and meetings for christian organizations. In 1954 the kindergarten was moved to a new building in Valdemarsgade where the institution B√∏rnely has survived into the 21st century. Aarhus Municipality took over the building when it became available and moved a youth club from Mejlgade into it. The club was named Mejlen after the former address and the building is still known by this name. The club stayed until the 70s when Red Cross rented the building. In 2009 the building was listed and in 2012 it was renovated after which the art gallery V58 moved in.  Architecture  The building was constructed in the historicist style popular at the time with references to Gothic and Renaissance styles while drawing clear inspiration from Diakonissestiftelsen on Frederiksbjerg from 1876. The small tower above the front entrance, which used to feature a bell, and the pointy arches of the windows are elements absent from the earlier work in Frederiksbjerg. The building material is red and brown brick.

The episode received a rating of 77% with an average score of 6.7 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Gotham finds the right mix of creepy and fun, even when the plot of 'Under the Knife' spreads the characters a bit too thin.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"With no Fish to follow (yay!) Gotham actually figured out a way to insert Barbara back into the story in an intriguing way. She could have just been a victim of the Ogre. Or someone that Gordon needed to save (again). But they chose to make her somewhat of a broken kindred spirit. Does she know what she's getting herself into? Probably not. But it'd be even cooler if she did.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade and wrote, \\"Now, through two episodes post-break, and with only two more to go, Gotham appears to be falling back into the pattern that‚Äôs defined most of this season, which involves convoluted storylines that stretch the characters (and audience‚Äôs patience) thin and rely far too much on exposition to move the plot along.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"Under the Knife (Gotham)"},{"id":"49245640","text":"(1848-1877) was a pioneer of Western-style painting in early Meiji Japan.

Austin State University, a position he has held since December 2018. Previous to his time as head coach, he was the defensive coordinator for his father and former West Texas A&M; University head coach, Don Carthel, from 2006 to 2012. He played college football at Angelo State University where he was an all-conference linebacker. Early life Carthel was born in Floydada, Texas and was reared in West Texas. He attended Friona High School in Friona, Texas where he captained the football team and led them to a district championship during the 1994 season. He also went to the State Track & Field Championships for his high school, placing fourth in the discus throw. He graduated from Friona High School in 1995. Playing career Carthel played college football at Angelo State University. He started at linebacker for the Rams during his senior season in 1999 and helped lead them to a Lone Star Conference title. He was a four-year letterman and starter for the Angelo State, as well as a three-time Academic All- Conference winner. He graduated in 2000 with a degree in biology. Coaching career=Early career= Upon graduation from Angelo State in 2000, Carthel began his coaching career as the defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator at Abilene Christian University, where he remained until 2006. In 2006 his father, Don Carthel, named him the defensive coordinator on his staff at West Texas A&M; University. =Texas A&M;‚ÄìCommerce= In 2013, Carthel was hired as the 19th head football coach at Texas A&M; University-Commerce. The program was coming off of two back-to-back 1‚Äì9 seasons, the worst two year stretch in school history. Carthel quickly established a new culture in Commerce that saw 50 of the 85 players leave the program. Carthel and his staff quickly plugged in the missing parts with mainly Junior College transfers and Division I transfers to quickly rebuild the program. Former Auburn University quarterback Tyrik Rollison, who had been considered the best high school quarterback in Texas in the class of 2010, transferred to Texas A&M-Commerce; and was one of many JUCO and Division I players from the Dallas/Fort Worth and Northeast Texas area that transferred to A&M-Commerce; to play for the Lions. 2013 season Carthel and the Lions started his first season by opening with a home win again Sul Ross State University 51‚Äì6. The next week in front of 20,000 LSC fans at AT&T; Stadium, Carthel's Lions upset the 22nd ranked Delta State. The next week Carthel the Lions faced off with his former team, West Texas A&M; in Canyon, Texas. The Lions stunned the crowd by jumping out to a 14‚Äì7 lead, but were bested by a prolific Buffalo team 68‚Äì28, and then dropped a 30‚Äì24 decision to Midwestern State the next week in Commerce. After a 2‚Äì2 start, the Lions rolled out 4 straight wins defeating Southeastern Oklahoma State 31‚Äì29, Texas A&M-Kingsville; 41‚Äì28, McMurry 65‚Äì43, and arch-rival Tarleton State 22‚Äì20. The Lions rounded out the season by dropping a close loss to the Angelo State Rams 25‚Äì20, bouncing back against Division I Houston Baptist Huskies 55‚Äì21, and ending the season with a last second 42‚Äì35 loss to Eastern New Mexico. Despite the late season loss, the Lions were invited to the 2013 LiveUnited Texarkana Bowl to finish the season 7‚Äì5 overall and fifth in the conference. 2014 season Carthel's 2014 A&M;‚ÄìCommerce squad led the nation in points per game with an average of 54.1, and yards per game with an average of 535.4. They opened the season with a record-breaking performance against East Texas Baptist in which they scored 98 points and amassed 986 total yards of offense and 13 touchdowns. The win gained the Lions national exposure as it was reported on ESPN's SportsCenter that same night. The next day, head coach Colby Carthel was interviewed by ESPN's Linda Cohn in regards to the win. In that win the Lions set national and conference records for points scored, yards gained, and total offense in a game. The Lions also defeated A&M-Kingsville;, Tarleton State, West Texas A&M;, Angelo State, and Tarleton State a second time in the conference playoffs. The lone losses were to the Division I Stephen F. Austin State Lumberjacks, Midwestern State, and to Angelo State in a conference finals rematch. The Lions won the Lone Star Conference championship for the 21st time in school history, the first time since the 1990 season. The Lions were left out of the NCAA playoffs, but were invited back to the postseason, which resulted in a 72‚Äì21 win over East Central University in the C.H.A.M.P.S. Heart of Texas Bowl, the win was the first postseason win for the program since a 1991 win over Grand Valley State in the 1991 NCAA first round of the playoffs to finish the season 9‚Äì3. The 2014 team saw Ricky Collins, Vernon Johnson, and Charles Tuaau be called to the NFL. 2015 season Prior to the start of the 2015 season the Lions were picked second to finish behind Angelo State. The Lions started out with a win against Adams State followed by a loss to a top ten Delta State team in a last second thriller. Carthel then guided the Lions to their second straight conference championship with an undefeated conference record, and qualified for the NCAA Division II playoffs for the first time since 1995, where they lost to the Ferris State Bulldogs in the first round of the playoffs, finishing 8‚Äì4 overall ranked #20 in the nation. The Lions were guided by former University of Nevada QB Harrison Stewart, Running Back Richard Cooper, Receiver Lance Evans, and Defensive Standouts Toni Pulu and Cole Pitts. Stewart threw for over 3,300 yards, putting him second all time for single season passing yards in Lion football History, while Cooper was an All-American and Evans, Pulu, and Pitts were all first team All-LSC Conference. The Lions led the conference in passing offense and total offense. 2016 season In the spring of 2016, Carthel was rewarded with a contract extension with options that would keep him Commerce until 2018. In his first three seasons as head coach he led the team to a total of three postseason appearances, two LSC championships, and seven or more wins in each season. He also helped lead a number of players to the NFL. Carthel's Lions started the season ranked 9th in the nation and picked to win the Lone Star Conference for the third straight year. All-American running back Richard Cooper returned for his senior season and was picked preseason conference back of the year. The Lions ran out to a 5-0 record to start the season, but lost by 1 point to Midwestern State in a back and forth affair in Commerce. The Lions then reeled off 5 straight wins and clinched their third straight LSC Championship after Midwestern lost to Eastern New Mexico in the final game of the season. The Lions once again were selected for the NCAA Division II national playoffs and hosted a first-round game for the first time since 1991. The Lions defeated 24th ranked Colorado-Mesa, setting them up with the second ranked Grand Valley State Lakers. The Lions bowed out in the second round to the Lakers, ending the season at 11-2. Lions Quarterback Luis Perez was selected as a Harlon Hill Trophy nominee, while punter Hector Dominguez was first team All-American and offensive lineman Jared Machorro was named second team All-American. Return specialist Shawn Hooks and linebacker Uriah Harris were both named All-Region team and the Lions placed 8 members on the All-Lone Star Conference first team, including Cooper, Perez, Hooks, Harris, Dominguez, Machorro, Defensive lineman Tavita Faaiu, and Wideout Lance Evans. The Lions 11-2 season was the most wins for the Lions since 1953 and the first time the Lions had double digit wins since 1990. In December 2016, TAMUC President Dr. Ray Keck and Athletic Director Tim McMurray announced they were extending Carthel's contract yet again, this time until 2020. 2017 season Carthel's Lions were picked to win a fourth straight Lone Star Conference title by the league's coaches and media.

The season started with a televised overtime thriller by beating rival Texas A&M-Kingsville; for the 7th straight season, something no other Lion coach had ever done. The Lions then defeated William Jewell College 27-17 and Lone Star Conference foe Eastern New Mexico 21-11. The Lions then lost their first game of the season to 22nd ranked Colorado State Pueblo 23-13. The Loss to CSU-P was only the second time in the Carthel era that the Lions were held without an offensive touchdown. The Lions made personnel changes on offense and rebounded to soundly defeat Lock Haven (Pennsylvania) 68-6, and then avenged their only loss of the previous season by beating Midwestern State 20-19. The MSU game was played in odd circumstances as the Lions and Mustangs played to a 10-10 tie in the first half in Wichita Falls, Texas, but could not continue due to inclement weather. The schools mutually agreed to continue the second half of the game at Apogee Stadium on the campus of The University of North Texas in Denton, Texas that following afternoon. After defeating MSU, the Lions lost for the first time in 5 years to A&M; System rival Tarleton State University 47-21. Again, the Lions rebounded by routing Western New Mexico 55-7 and defeating another cross state rival, West Texas A&M;, 41-16. The Lions finished the season with a close win against Texas-Permian Basin 20-17 and clinched a spot in the NCAA Division II playoffs for the fourth straight season with a 41-13 win over Angelo State. The Lions finished the regular season with a 9-2 record, a # 15 national ranking, LSC runner-ups, and Carthel was named Lone Star Conference Coach of The Year. They then defeated an undefeated and top 5 ranked Minnesota-Duluth team 33-17 in the first round of the NCAA Division II Playoffs, before bowing out in a second round rematch against conference foe Tarleton State 34-28 to end the year at 10-3. =Stephen F.

Trumbull, the son of John M. and Hannah W. (Tunis) Trumbull, was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, November 1, 1819, his father being a grandson of Governor Jonathan Trumbull, the elder, of Connecticut. He entered early on a business career in New York City, but when the house with which he was connected was blotted out in the commercial panic of 1837, he returned to his father, who had now removed to Colchester, Connecticut, and was prepared at the academy there for the Sophomore class in Yale College. After graduation in 1842 he spent three years in Princeton Theological Seminary, and was ordained at Norwich, Conn., as a foreign missionary on June 13, 1845. He had already accepted an appointment to go to Valparaiso, Chile, under the auspices of the Foreign Evangelical Society and the American Seamen's Friend Society, to accomplish what he could in the way of providing opportunities of Protestant worship for sailors and foreign residents speaking the English language. He landed in Valparaiso on Christmas Day, 1845, and began at once what proved to be his life-long work. In 1847 a Union Church was organized, and in 1848 he began the publication of an English paper. In 1849 he visited the United States, and was married in New Haven, June 5, 1850, to Jane W. Fitch, a niece of the Rev. Professor Fitch, of Yale College. The next month he sailed again for Valparaiso, which was his home for the rest of his life. He took a leading part in all philanthropic and charitable movements in Valparaiso, and won for himself by his career such a place in the public esteem that the Chilean press on the occasion of his death rendered the frankest and warmest tributes to his character and influence. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by his Alma Mater in 1884. In 1879 he was attacked with angina pectoris, and sought rest by a long visit to the United States. In 1886 there was a return of the disease, which was thenceforward kept in control by constant watchfulness. Special exertion at the end of December, 1888, brought on another series of attacks, and his death followed on February 1, in his 70th year. His wife survived him with two sons (graduates of Yale in 1878 and 1883) and two daughters; two other children died in infancy, and three in opening manhood and womanhood,‚Äîthe deaths of the eldest son (Yale 1876) and of the third son (Yale 1880) being especially sudden and distressing.

Of the of the park, 38.8 km2 are protected water areas of the lake itself. Topography Zaybaykalsky is bounded on the west by the shores of Lake Baikal, on the north by the Barguzin Nature Reserve (a strictly protected 'zapovednik' nature reserve of about the same size as Zaybaykalsky), on the south and east by the Barguzin mountain range. The highest point in the park is Mt. Barmashovoe, at . The park is, above all, steep. 55% of the park is on a slope of more than 26 degrees, and an additional 28% is between 16 and 25 degrees. The Svyatoy Noy peninsula is 53 km long and 35 km wide, with its own mountain complex, the highest peak of which is 1877 meters. The island mountains are forested with birch, larch pine and rhododendron. It has several dozen mountain streams and springs, and is connected to the mainland by the Chivyrkuisky isthmus. The island is known for its views of the lake (allowing a high central viewpoint wo see mountains ranges across the water on all sides), and for its \\"singing sand\\" Marokov beach, so called because of the sound made by walking on it. The Ushkany Islands, in the middle of the lake but part of Zaybaykalsky park, are the above-water eastern end of the submerged Academician Ridge, which separates Lake Baikal into northern and southern basins. The western shore of the lake sees the Academic ridge rise again above the water in the form of Olkhon Island, which is part of Pribaykalsky National Park. The Ushkany are an archipelago four islands totaling 10 km2 in area. They are famous as the central home of the Baikal seal. The islands are marble and limestone, and contain caves with evidence of human habitation from the Neolithic age. Ecoregion and climate Zaybaykalsky is located in the East Siberian taiga ecoregion (WWF ID#601). This ecoregion is situated between the Yenisei River and Lena River. Its northern border reaches the Arctic Circle, and its southern border reaches 52¬∞N latitude. The dominant vegetation formation is light coniferous taiga with Larix gmelini forming the canopy in areas with low snow cover. This ecoregion is rich in minerals. The climate at Zaybaykalsky is Subarctic climate, dry winters (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dwc)). This climate is characterized by long, very cold winters, and cool summers, but with little snow in winters. The lake has a somewhat moderating effect on Zaybaykalsky - average January temperatures are -18 C, while average July temperatures are 23 C. Temperatures in the mountain values may be a few degrees colder. Annual precipitation averages 450 mm on the shore of the lake to 550 mm in the mountains. Prevailing winds are from the south and southwest. Flora Because of the sharp grades from the lake shore to mountain tops, the forests of Trans-Baikal display strong altitude zone in the tree cover. The forests are mostly conifers of the Eastern Siberian taiga in nature: 34% of the forests are pine (Pinus sylvestris), 30% is Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), 14% are Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica), and 9% are larch (Larix gmelmii). Approximately are in old growth stands. View Chivyrkuisky Isthmus and Barguzin Bay from the top of the Holy Nose Fauna The forest animals of the park are typical of the southern Siberian forest: bear, wolf, fox, lynx, sable, otter, wolverine, moose, musk deer, squirrel, chipmunk, muskrat and hare. In the alpine meadows one of the mammals is the black-capped marmot. 249 species of birds have been recorded in the territory. The great cormorant, once exterminated from the region, has returned. During the summer, up to 3,000 Baikal seals at a time congregate on the rocks of the Ushinsky islands. On a smaller scale, Bolshoy Ushinsky island is known for the greatest concentration of large anthills in Russia - thousands that rise up to 1.5 meters in height.

According to Joe Siddall: \\"He does it by separating and delaying torso rotation after the foot hits the floor after leg kick, exposing his back plate surname and number, before uncoiling, with the bat at the same angle as his shoulders. When facing a strikeout or pay-off pitch (X-2 or 3-2), he replaces the leg kick with the left knee bowing inwards.\\" Personal life Bichette is the son of four-time MLB All-Star outfielder Dante Bichette, and the younger brother of Dante Bichette Jr.. He is named after Bo Jackson. He is a Christian. Both Bo and his brother Dante Jr. have played for Brazil in the WBC due to their mother Mariana being a native of Porto Alegre, Brazil.

Source: Bulgarian Archives State Agency Raphael Popov (1830-1876), Bulgarian Byzantine-Catholic Bishop Archbishop Nil Izvorov (1823-1905) The Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Constantinople (informally Constantinople of the Bulgarians) was the first missionary, pre-diocesan jurisdiction of the Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church sui iuris (Eastern Catholic of Byzantine Rite in Bulgarian language). As Apostolic Vicariate it was exempt, i.e. directly dependent on the Holy See, and entitled to a titular bishop. It was created in 1861 and reorganized in 1883.Catholic Hierarchy: Diocese of Bulgarian United Church  History  Since the Union of Kukush in 1859, there was a movement among Bulgarians who converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Eastern Catholicism for creation of a particular ecclesiastical jurisdiction. On April 14, 1861 in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, Bulgarian Byzantine-Catholic archimandrite Joseph Sokolsky was consecrated Archbishop, and appointed apostolic vicar for the Catholic Bulgarians of the Byzantine Rite in Ottoman Empire. Upon his return to Constantinople, he was accepted in that capacity by the authorities of Ottoman Empire. Sololski was recognized by the Ottoman government as secular head of the Bulgarian Catholic Millet (millet basi) and the Sultan issued a special decree (irade) for that occasion.Anna Kr≈≠steva, Communities and Identities in Bulgaria, Longo, 1998, , p. 308. However, in the summer of the very same year he was detached for Russia, never to return to his post. He died in 1879.Catholic Hierarchy: Archbishop Josif Sokolski When it became obvious that Joseph Sokolsky will not be returning from Russia, one of his closest associates - Bulgarian Byzantine-Catholic priest Raphael Popov was recognized in 1864 as \\"Patriarchal Vicar and popular leader of the Bulgarians united with the Roman Catholic Church\\" by the Ottoman authorities. On March 28, 1865 he was appointed Apostolic Administrator (pro tempore) of the Bulgarian Byzantine-Catholic Church and its vicariate in Constantinople. He was ordained a bishop on November 19, 1865 in the cathedral church \\"St. John Chrysostom\\" in Constantinople. Later he transferred his offices to Edirne and continued serving until his death on February 23, 1876.Catholic Hierarchy: Bishop Rafail Popov He was succeeded by bishop Nil Izvorov, who previously converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Eastern Catholicism in 1874. His succession was confirmed on 5 September 1876 by the Holy See and thus he became the new head of Bulgarian Byzantine-Catholic Church and administrator (pro tempore) of its vicariate in Constantinople. In 1878, autonomous Principality of Bulgaria and province of Eastern Rumelia were created. In following years important reorganization took place. in 1883, Nil Izvorov was promoted to Archbishop,Catholic Hierarchy: Archbishop Nilo Isvoroff and on that occasion new arrangements were made for the future administration. On 7 April 1883, the vicariate lost Turkish Thrace as territory to establish the Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Thrace.Catholic Hierarchy: Vicariate Apostolic of Tracia (Bulgarian) On 12 June 1883 its western territory was reorganized as the Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Macedonia, which covered entire historical region of Macedonia (the Salonica Vilayet). New vicariates remained under spiritual jurisdiction of Archbishop Nil Izvorov. In 1895, Nil Izvorov converted back to Eastern Orthodoxy, retrieved to Bulgaria and died in 1905.Catholic Hierarchy: Archbishop Nilo Isvoroff In 1907, priest Michael Mirov was appointed titular Archbishop of Theodosiopolis and took the administration of the Bulgarian Byzantine-Catholic Vicariate in Constantinople. He served there until his death in 1923.Catholic Hierarchy: Archbishop Michel Miroff (Mirov) During his administration, important events took place. In 1912, Balkan Wars broke out and by 1913 Ottoman Empire lost entire region of Macedonia and much of the Thrace. Soon after that, First World War (1914-1918) broke out. During those years, Bulgarian Catholic vicariates suffered drastic reduction of their jurisdiction, and after 1918 new arrangements had to be made. After death of archbishop Michael Mirov in 1923, the vicariate was finally suppressed in 1926 and its remaining (Bulgarian) territory reassigned to establish the Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Sofia, which remained as the particular church's last and only jurisdiction, absorbing both Constantinople's above daughter vicariates, Thrace and Macedonia.

Much of her writing was bilingual and bicultural featuring both the English and Spanish language and contained very sexual content. Through her work, de la tierra gave voice to LGBTQ people of color and inspired other writers to speak about sex and sexuality in an honest manner. Early life Tatiana de la tierra was born in Villavicencio, Colombia on May 14, 1961, and emigrated to the US in 1969, at the age of eight. Her family settled in Homestead, Florida, and that was where she first discovered her passion for books and librarianship. She befriended the head librarian at the elementary school she attended in town and volunteered there. She was trusted by the head librarian to such an extent that she was given a key to the back room where all the sexuality books were kept, and she would peek at these at a young age. Although de la tierra did not come out as lesbian until 1982, she knew she was attracted to females around the time she reached age 10 or 11. When she was young, she would explore the female body by creating games to play with some of her girl friends that included looking at each other's nipples and vaginas. However, when she became a teen de la tierra desexualized herself because some of her friends and peers made her feel like outsider for being so curious about sexuality. From then on, she only harbored secret crushes on girls, and did not have any romantic partners while growing up. It was not until de la tierra graduated from South Dade High School in 1979 and went off to college that she began exploring her sexual preferences once more. De la tierra's awareness of her sexuality later became a very important part of her career as a writer. She fell in love with poetry before even reading the work of any lesbian writers. Around the time that she was 11, she read Edna St. Vincent Millay's \\"Renascence\\" and was instantly hooked. Career De la tierra attended Miami- Dade Community College straight out of high school and received her associate degree in 1981; it was there that she had her first official library-related job as a librarian assistant. She then attended the University of Florida, where she attained her bachelor's degree in psychology in 1984. In the 1990s, de la tierra began editing and publishing Esto no tiene nombre (This has no name), which later became known as Conmoci√≥n and was some of her most famous work. =Esto no tiene nombre= Esto no tiene nombre was a quarterly Latina lesbian magazine that had bilingual content and published the work of other renowned Latina writers like Cherr√≠e Moraga, Achy Obejas, Carmelita Tropicana, Laura Aguilar, Marcia Ochoa, Juana Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez and Luz Mar√≠a Umpierre. Much of de la tierra's early work was self-published and distributed by-hand at gatherings, including at the Encuentros de Lesbianas Feministas de Am√©rica Latina y del Caribe (\\"Gatherings of Lesbian Feminists of Latin America and the Caribbean\\"). Esto no tiene nombre actually started off as a magazine without a title and de la tierra tried to get its readers involved in the process of naming the magazine. After much debate the magazine's name became Esto no tiene nombre. Its title is a symbol of rejection towards the heteronormative label and image of Latina lesbians. It was the first Latina lesbian magazine distributed internationally. The magazine's content and call for activism was inspired by the feminist work of Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press and publications such as This Bridge Called my Back. =Themes in her writing= A lot of de la tierra's work challenged heteronormative views. For example, in her poem \\"ode to an unsavory lesbian\\" de la tierra talks about her own queer desires that deviate from the norm; what she finds attractive is what society would label as ugly. She became an activist through her work and felt a need to challenge the stereotypes surrounding lesbianism and what it means to be a woman or woman of color. She also wanted schools to incorporate LGBTQ issues and material into their curricula; more specifically, she hoped this would happen in all English composition classes from elementary to high school as this could prevent homophobia and educate students on the concept of identity. de la tierra's writing style was not only progressive but humorous and daring. One of Conmoci√≥n's issues, published by a collective in San Francisco during one of de la tierra's illnesses included a quiz titled \\"100% Latina Lesbian Checklist\\" that poked fun at the symbol of 100% Latina Lesbian Vision which graced each issue. The quiz was funny and entertaining, giving the readers points for having a \\"penis-free zone\\" (hinting at owning any dildos or similar objects). =Reception= A lot of conservatives were offended by her writing because she spoke and wrote so unapologetically. De la tierra did not hold back when it came to eroticism, and she was so free in her speech that her writing was compared to pornography. However, some writers found de la tierra's work inspirational and empowering. She was shameless about discussing sexuality and this encouraged others to speak freely about sexuality, sex, and the human body. =Later work= After a while, Esto no tiene nombre and Conmoci√≥n stopped publishing because of a lack of funds. Around 1995, de la tierra decided to change her style of writing a bit. She noticed that she had spent many years writing about Latina lesbianism in an effort to give that community a voice, but now she wanted to try writing more about whatever she pleased. De la tierra was diagnosed with lupus in 1990 and this prompted her decision to try something different to better herself as an author. She decided to attend the University of Texas at El Paso, where she got her Master's of Fine Arts in creative writing in 1999. De la tierra also attained a Master's of Library Science from University at Buffalo in 2000. Right after graduating from Buffalo, she started her Jean Blackwell Hutson Library Residency at the University at Buffalo's undergraduate library. Two years later, she was hired by that same library as an information literacy librarian. Later, she moved to California, where she became the director of Hispanic Services at Inglewood Public Library. Final years and death De la tierra struggled with health issues relating to her kidneys, and during her final years she took her health condition into consideration by deciding to stop writing from a Latina lesbian activist perspective and focus instead on other themes of interest. She was told she was in danger of dying several times throughout her life, but it was not until she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer that de la tierra's fight had to end. Although she had many goals she had not yet completed when she was diagnosed, such as completing the memoir she was in the process of writing, de la tierra was at peace with the thought of death and knew her body had put up a long, hard fight. De la tierra died on July 31, 2012. Her papers and unpublished materials were donated to the University of California, Los Angeles to be studied.

Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) continues to push the mob war even further. The episode was watched by 4.58 million viewers and received mixed- to-positive reviews with critics praising the plot twist but criticizing the lack of plot advancement. Plot Shortly after Jason \\"The Ogre\\" Lennon reveals his true intentions to Barbara and holds her captive, he tells her, at knifepoint, to choose his next victim. During the investigation at the Foxglove Club, Gordon and Bullock locate the \\"Ogre's\\" apartment at Gotham Royal Hotel, but he and Barbara had already left for her parents' mansion, and both are killed. Nygma disposes of officer Dougherty's body in the forensic lab and pens a letter, posing as Dougherty, explaining that he left town. Bruce sneaks into Bunderslaw's office at Wayne Enterprises and opens his safe, which is empty. Bunderslaw himself arrives and reveals that he was expecting Bruce, and has consequently removed the incriminating documents. He confesses to Bruce that his father and grandfather knew about illegal activities in the company, but decided to keep quiet. Afterwards, Bunderslaw orders Lucius Fox (Chris Chalk) to lead Bruce away. Lucius subtly tells Bruce that while Bruce's father knew of the illegal activities, he did not approve of them. The O'Connor assassination attempt is revealed to be a set-up designed by Cobblepot to start a war between Falcone and Maroni. Gordon and Bullock arrive at the house of Barbara's parents to find them dead. After a brutal fight with Jim, the \\"Ogre\\" holds Barbara at knifepoint until Bullock distracts him for Jim to shoot him. Later, Jim confesses to Leslie that he no longer loves Barbara. Consumed with guilt, Bruce confesses his and Selina's murder of Reggie to Alfred, eventually also admitting to his visit to Bunderslaw. After Alfred tells Bruce that his father was a good man, Bruce states that even good men can have dark secrets. Several crimes and killings committed by Maroni and his crew alert Captain Essen, who calls all officers of the GCPD to remain on duty during the upcoming gang war.

The episode received a rating of 60% with an average score of 6.7 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Though the plot twist was surprising, 'The Anvil or the Hammer' disregarded Gothams own history, muddying up the narrative with a nonsensical story.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"okay\\" 6.6 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"A sloppy, silly penultimate episode took us through a parade of familiar beats as Gotham now heads into its season finale. The highlight here was that something actually horrifying happened to Barbara. Something that may may make her snap entirely. Certainly a far cry from the time she was held comfortably captive by Falcone and fed fresh-baked muffins.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"B‚àí\\" grade and wrote, \\"In fact, much of 'The Anvil Or The Hammer' signals a way forward for Gotham, giving us moments that prove this show can be more than a lackluster procedural. The multi-episode arc of the Ogre is the most obvious strength here. It proves that Gotham is better off without case-of-the-week structure, instead choosing to focus on a long-term narrative, rolling out storylines that have consequences in the future and allow the characters to experience something resembling growth.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"The Anvil or the Hammer"},{"id":"49246433","text":"Andrei Vasile Muntean (born January 30, 1993) is a Romanian male artistic gymnast and a member of the national team.

It is exclusively grown in the region around Devanahalli taluk, Bangalore Rural District, India, as an exotic crop variety. Its officially designated name is \\"Devanahalli Pomello (Chakkota)\\"; it is locally known as chakkota. The Devanahalli pomelo is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India. It was registered by the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trademarks under the title \\"Devanahalli Pomello\\" and recorded at GI Application number 131 under Class 31 as a horticulture item. The fruit enjoys a strong market demand. Its sweet taste and flavour are considered to be better than those of other varieties in the market. Location The fruit was initially grown in villages around Devanahalli taluk, including Beerasandra, Bidalur, Chanarayapatna, Kundana, Melinathotadahalli, Neelaganapalya, Neelaguntepalya, Raghunathapura, Rajathafarm, Shivanapura, Soopanahalli, and Vishwanathapura and some regions in India. These villages lie within the geographical range of and . After a large land acquisition to build the Kempegowda International Airport, the plant is now grown only in a few, non-contiguous villages. History The pomelo tree shares ancestry with the grapefruit. The Devanahalli pomelo has a unique, sweet taste, unlike other local varieties which have a bitter taste. Five decades ago, this plant's special sweetness trait was compromised by natural crossbreeding with local varieties, and it was nearing extinction. A few old Devanahalli pomelo plants were identified in the area and then propagated widely, which preserved this variety. This plant has faced a serious threat in recent years of near extinction due to construction of the Bengaluru International Airport at Devanahalli. The horticultural land on which the trees were growing was sold by farmers at high prices, and many Devanahalli pomelo trees were felled. The Department of Horticulture is collecting germ plasm of the fruit to preserve its novelty and promote cultivation. The Department of Horticulture also established a conservation biocentre at Hulimavu to assist in distributing plants to the remaining farmers. Alternative methods of grafting were also explored. Due to the special soil conditions at Devanahalli and its Geographical Indication (GI) status, the Devanahalli pomelo can not be planted in other places. The fruit has now made a comeback with the increasing demand, though there are now fewer than 100 farmers engaged in its cultivation. Mahatma Gandhi is said to have tasted this fruit when offered one by a local farmer during his visit to Nandi Hills, a hill resort near to Devanahalli. According to said farmer, Gandhi liked its taste and suggested that the authorities conserve this variety. Characteristics=Conditions= Devanahalli is cool and has moderate humidity, producing agro-climatic weather conditions which are conducive to the growth of the Devanahalli pomelo. The soil is generally red soil consisting of gravel, loam, and clay with high drainage conditions, favourable for the growth of this tree. Rainfall in the area varies from per year. =Trees and fruit= The tree grows with a twisted trunk of to varying heights of . It has needles on the branchlets, aged limbs and trunk. Its leaves are large with petioles in the shape of wings, a dull green colour, and an elliptical or oblong egg shape. The flowers are sweet- smelling, and fruits are formed in globular, egg, or pear shapes, with the width varying from . The colour of the juicy pulp is pink or red. Segments of the fruit are easy to remove. The outer skin of the fruit is a greenish-yellow colour. In matured fruit, the number of seeds varies from eight to ten. The fruit contains vitamin C and beta carotene. =Propagation= Propagation of the Devanahalli pomelo uses cuttings, grafts, and air layering. In a nursery in Devanahalli, grafting is done by an organic farming method which takes about three months, and about 400 saplings are marketed in a year. After fine tilling and kneading of the soil, the plant grafts are placed in pits measuring one meter on each side. The pit is filled with a blend of farm yard manure, top soil, and cake of neem and groundnut to a quarter of the depth of the pits and then watered. During the rainy season, fertilizers are added. Neem oil is also added as a pest control measure. It is irrigated when possible. Flowering occurs twice a year during December/January and June/July. Fruits are grown for about 11 months, then picked in order to generate seedlings. Each tree yields an average of 300 to 400 fruits annually. The fruits typically weigh about 2 to 2.5 kg and can weigh up to 10 kg. They have a long shelf life of 45‚Äì60 days. Fruits are known by their distinguishing pink or red juicy carpels, which have a sweet and sour taste. Quality control is maintained by the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science of the University of Agriculture Sciences, Bangalore. The fruit is directly edible and is also used to prepare desserts and jellies. Pomelo peel is also used in making cosmetics and Ayurvedic medicines.

It is usually a low, spreading shrub with pinkish-lilac to purple flowers and is widespread in the Northern Territory and all mainland states except Victoria. It is considered a difficult agricultural weed in some parts of Queensland but is often used as a bush medicine by Aboriginal people. Description Eremophila gilesii is usually a low spreading shrub but sometimes prostrate and sometimes an erect shrub. It usually grows to a height of between and has branches and leaves which are sticky due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and are long, wide, linear to lance-shaped, and covered with glandular hairs. The margins of the leaves are sometimes serrated or have fine teeth. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on an S-shaped, sticky, flattened stalk long. There are 5 linear to lance-shaped, tapering green sepals which are long and covered with mostly glandular hairs. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white to lilac-coloured on the outside and white, spotted purple on the inside. The outside of the tube and petal lobes are hairy but the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is woolly. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from March to November and is followed by fruit which are dry, woody, oval-shaped, hairy and long. Wiluna Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1873 by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (gilesii) honours Ernest Giles who collected the type specimen. There are two subspecies: *Eremophila gilesii F.Muell. subsp. gilesii which has distinctly flattened flower stalks and linear leaves and is the more widespread subspecies; *Eremophila gilesii subsp. variabilis Chinnock which has flower stalks that are only slightly flattened in the lower part, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves and is only found in Western Australia. Distribution and habitat In New South Wales, Eremophila gilesii subsp. gilesii occurs in the Wanaaring and Enngonia districts in the north west of the state. It is widespread in the western half of South Australia, the southern half of the Northern Territory and in a central band across Western Australia. It grows in sand or loam soils on plains and low hills. Subspecies variabilis only occurs in Western Australia in the Gascoyne, Gibson Desert, Great Victoria Desert, Little Sandy Desert and Murchison biogeographic regions where it grows in sand, clay or laterite on plains or in rocky areas. Ecology Because Eremophila gilesii rapidly regenerates after clearing of mulga, it is regarded as an agricultural weed in places such as south-west Queensland. It is a prolific producer of seeds and can easily form dense stands of up to 12,000 shrubs per hectare (5,000 per acre), restricting the growth of pasture. Biological control with the grasshoppers Monistria discrepans and M. pustulifera has been trialled as has management such as heavy stocking after rainfall exceeding in areas where this plant is a problem. More recent studies have shown that mechanical treatments such as ploughing and heavy stocking may not reduce the number of plants, but instead reduce their size, making stock movement easier. Conservation status Both subspecies of Eremophila gilesii are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses=Indigenous use= Aboriginal people use this eremophila in several ways including as a decoction and infusion to treat ailments such as headache, chest pains, sores and colds. =Horticulture= This eremophila is suitable for most gardens but the Queensland form has larger grey leaves and flowers over a longer period than others. All have large, blue to purple, well-displayed flowers. It can be grown from cuttings or by grafting, the latter method being preferred if the plant is to be grown in heavier soils. Mature plants are drought and frost tolerant but respond to watering during long dry spells and to light pruning to manage its shape.

The painting is the work of Canadian artist Margaret Sutherland of Kingston Ontario. The work made national headlines after it was awarded a public unveiling by the Kingston Arts Council's annual juried salon at the Kingston Frontenac Public Library. Sources of inspiration In 2012, Sutherland revealed in an interview that the title of the painting draws its inspiration from the short story \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" by Hans Christian Andersen. The painting itself is modeled after the famous painting Olympia by √âdouard Manet. Of the many messages in the painting, Sutherland's main inspiration for drawing the portrait was due to the lack of female cabinet ministers in the Harper Government. The woman in the purple suit in the background of the portrait is a representation of former Harper minister Bev Oda. Human rights complaint After the initial public unveiling of the painting, Curtis Stewart of St. Albert, Alberta, lodged a human rights complaint against the Kingston Frontenac Public Library at the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal. Stewart's application argued that his rights were infringed when the library chose to display the risque painting as part of a local art show. After seven months, the human rights complaint was dismissed. Sale at auction Danielle Potvin bought the painting from the Edward Day Gallery (Toronto) in June 2012 for $5,000. In the fall of 2015, she decided to sell the painting to pay for home renovations and the painting was put for sale for $8,800 in Kijiji in Chicoutimi, Qu√©bec, Montr√©al, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. An article from Jana G. Pruden, from the Edmonton Journal (23 November 2015) started a bidding war, which was won by the Vancouver-based technology entrepreneur Frederick Ghahramani. Ghahramani revealed his intention was to share the painting with Canadian high-schools and Universities for no fee, because he felt Sutherland's work is \\"going to be a Canadian artifact, and does a brilliant job capturing the mood of over 60% of Canadians who felt our Prime Minister didn't want to listen to his own experts.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:2011 paintings Category:Modern paintings Category:Symbolist paintings Category:Paintings in Canada Category:Stephen Harper ","title":"Emperor Haute Couture"},{"id":"49246583","text":"Gopal Singha Dev II was the fifty-eighth king of the Mallabhum.

As of July 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 616 endangered arthropod species. 6.5% of all evaluated arthropod species are listed as endangered. The IUCN also lists 27 arthropod subspecies as endangered. No subpopulations of arthropods have been evaluated by the IUCN. For a species to be considered endangered by the IUCN it must meet certain quantitative criteria which are designed to classify taxa facing \\"a very high risk of extinction\\". An even higher risk is faced by critically endangered species, which meet the quantitative criteria for endangered species. Critically endangered arthropods are listed separately. There are 1010 arthropod species which are endangered or critically endangered. Additionally 2875 arthropod species (30% of those evaluated) are listed as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient information for a full assessment of conservation status. As these species typically have small distributions and/or populations, they are intrinsically likely to be threatened, according to the IUCN. While the category of data deficient indicates that no assessment of extinction risk has been made for the taxa, the IUCN notes that it may be appropriate to give them \\"the same degree of attention as threatened taxa, at least until their status can be assessed.\\" This is a complete list of endangered arthropod species and subspecies as evaluated by the IUCN.

It was built in 1915 as the residence of Alexander Turnbull and to house his private library, later bequeathed to New Zealand as the Alexander Turnbull Library.

History The House's architecture is a mix of Queen Anne and Scottish baronial architecture and was designed by architect William Turnbull (no relation). The building's design incorporated three large library rooms to house Turnbull's large collection of books, maps, and documents. The outbreak of World War I delayed construction of the house until late 1915. After Turnbull's death in 1918, the house was purchased by the government in 1920 and opened to the public as the Alexander Turnbull Library. The library stayed in the building until 1973 when the collection was incorporated into the National Library of New Zealand. After many years as a meeting and conference venue, the building was closed to the public in 2012 due to earthquake risk. Investigations have taken longer than expected but strengthening work is intended to be completed before a 2023 deadline.

Illustration to Heimskringla, 1899. The Saga of Harald Fairhair (Haralds saga h√°rfagra) is the third of the sagas in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla, after Ynglinga saga and the saga of Halfdan the Black. Snorri sagas were written in Iceland in the 1220s. This saga is about the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair.  Content  The saga is divided into 44 chapters. The saga begins with Harald taking over the kingdom at age 10 after the death of his father Halvdan. Halvdan probably had his royal seat at Ringerike or Hadeland, and the kingdom included inner Eastern parts of Norway. After Halvdan's death several local kings tried to take over his empire but Harald defended it with the help of his uncle Guttorm.Snorri, Harald H√•rfagres saga, ch. 1-2 The saga tells us about Harald's proposal to the princess Gyda Eiriksdatter who refused to marry someone who was king of a small kingdom. She is thereby given credit for having spurred Harald to the adventures recounted in this collection of works.Snorri, Harald H√•rfagres saga, ch. 3 Snorri goes on about Harald's mission to Tr√∏ndelag, his victories there, and his further journey to M√∂re. Snorri cites from poet en √ûorbj√∂rn Hornklofi's poem Glymdr√•pa and a little later in the saga from scald Eyvindr sk√°ldaspillir.Snorri, Harald H√•rfagres saga, ch.12 Chapter 13 tells that Harald was back in Viken having conquered the whole west country, adding it to his kingship Vingulmark. Chapters 16 and 17 tell about Harald's matches in G√∂taland (Sweden); the saga of Chapter 18 recounts the Battle of Hafrsfjord that gave Harald a definitive position as King of all Norway. √ûorbj√∂rn Hornklofi made this poem about the battle:Snorri, Harald H√•rfagres saga, ch. 18. This is the first stanza of the poem. Heyr√∞ir √≠ Hafrsfir√∞i, hv√© hizug bar√∞isk konungr enn kynst√≥ri vi√∞ Kj«´tva enn au√∞lag√∞a; knerrir k√≥mu austan, kaps of lystir, me√∞ gin«´ndum h«´f√∞um ok gr«´fnum tinglum. After the victory at Hafrsfjord saga, Harald took the maiden Gyda, married her and had 5 children. The saga is otherwise generous with accounts of Harald's wives and children. Snorri mentions √Ösa, one Svanhild, one √Öshild, and finally Ragnhild the Mighty, a daughter of King Eirik of Jutland. It is there stated that he sent his 9 wives away to marry Ragnhild. √ûorbj√∂rn Hornklofi was quoted on this:Snorri, Saga of Harald Finehair, Ch. 21 Hafna√∞i Holmr√Ωgjum ok H«´r√∞a meyjum hverri enni heinversku ok H«´lga √¶ttar konungr enn kynst√≥ri, es t√≥k konu danska. Snorri tells us that Harald had his hair cut off by Ragnvald, Earl of Moer after 10 years, and he was named H√•rfagre (Finehair). Previously he was nicknamed Luva (the scruffy), as mentioned in the Hornkl√∏ves poem about the Battle of Hafrsfjord. Woven into the saga is the story of Sn√∏frid Sv√•sedatter, a sami girl who had enchanted the King. According to the story, Harald and Sn√∏frid had 4 sons among whom were Turf-Einar (Einar Jarl) and Halfdan H√•legg. They are discussed in the Orkneyinga saga as controversial and puzzling individuals.Snorri, Harald H√•rfagres saga, ch. 25 Chapter 32 relates Harald's mission to The Orkneys. Moreover, Snorri tells us about Harald's relationship with the King √Üthelstan and Harald's son H√•kon, later Haakon the Good. √Üthelstan brought up H√•kon, and Snorri portrays it as if Harald tricked √Üthelstan to do so. In the final chapters, Snorri tells that Harald put forth his son Eirik Bloodaxe to rule the country. King Eric has no self-named saga behind him, but he is briefly discussed in this saga and in the subsequent saga about his half brother, Haakon the Good.Snorri, Harald H√•rfagres saga, ch. 40-44  Literary style  While Heimskringla, the Harald Fairhair saga, is still recognized as some of the best in Old Norse literature from this period as \\"due primarily to Snorri uniting historical criticism and thinking with ingenious storytelling. He composes meticulously; prepares and creates excitement, regression and expectation until the decision falls in an intense, dramatic scene. \\"Harald Beyer: Norsk litteraturhistorie, p 51 The other sources, √Ågrip af N√≥regskonungas√∂gum and Fagrskinna, are more concise and sober in style, while Snorri elaborates and enlivens the action and people. Snorri shows an ability to find relationships, motives and reasons. He gives passion to speeches and conversations.  Written records  The only preserved medieval written source of the Snorri sagas is Codex Frisianus from about 1330. The other records were lost in a library fire in Copenhagen in 1728.

By the time he was 21 years old, Ag√ºero was already publishing his poetry in local newspapers. He studied at Escuela Normal de Heredia and began his career as a Latin and Spanish Literature professor in 1929. While teaching at Liceo de Costa Rica and Instituto de Alajuela, Ag√ºero made a name for himself as a prominent educator. He went on to serve as principal at various Costa Rican public schools and as a Spanish language teacher in Florida in the late 1940s. When the first Costa Rican college of humanities was founded at the University of Costa Rica, Ag√ºero was among its first-ever faculty members. At University of Costa Rica, he engaged in extensive research on philology and became one of the University's most distinguished professors. Ag√ºero published most of his literary work during his 15 years as Chair of the Department of Philology, Linguistics and Literature at University of Costa Rica. In 1955, having achieved national renown as a poet and philologist, he was elected to the Academia Costarricense de la Lengua (English: Costa Rican Academy of the Language), which he would later preside from 1981 until his death in 2001. As an academician, Ag√ºero's linguistic research would extend beyond Costa Rica, earning him membership in numerous language academies, including the Real Academia Espa√±ola (English: Royal Spanish Academy) and the North American Academy of the Spanish Language. Furthermore, Ag√ºero's role as Director of the Costa Rican Academy of the Language would get him acquainted with Spanish writers D√°maso Alonso and Camilo Jos√© Cela, who would later become his personal friends. Besides his poetry and academic work, Arturo Ag√ºero also gained recognition for his columns in Costa Rican newspapers La Naci√≥n and La Prensa Libre. Ag√ºero died at age 94 on May 11, 2001. Upon news of his demise, Costa Rican journalists were not able to list the extensive number of awards that Ag√ºero had received throughout his career. Awards and recognitions * In 1949, he received the National Prize for Poetry. * In 1955, he received the National Prize for Costumbrista Poetry. * In 1963, he was bestowed the Knight's cross of the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques by the French government. * In 1967, he was awarded with the Nicaraguan Orden de Rub√©n Dar√≠o. * In 1975, he was given the title professor emeritus of the University of Costa Rica. * He was bestowed honorary citizenship in San Ram√≥n in 1978, and in Alajuela in 1979. * In 1984, he received the Mag√≥n National Prize for Culture, the highest honour awarded by the Costa Rican government to national artists and intellectuals. * In 1997, he became Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Costa Rica. * In 1999, Felipe VI of Spain named him an Honorary Member of the Foundation \\"Monasteries of San Mill√°n de la Cogolla\\". * In 2003, the University of Costa Rica's Western Campus library was named after him. * He was named \\"Guest of Honor\\" in Tampa, Mexico City, Puebla City, Paris, Managua and Lima.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Tourmaline (PY-20)‚Äîa yacht built in 1930 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works as Sylvia‚Äîwas purchased by the Navy on 16 May 1941 from Logan G. Thomson. She entered the Marine Basin Co., Brooklyn, New York, on 23 June, for conversion before proceeding to the New York Navy Yard where she was commissioned as Tourmaline on 19 September 1941, Lt. Comdr. Charles E. Judge, USNR, in command. Service history The converted yacht departed New York harbor on 2 October and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, two days later. She operated out of Hampton Roads during the two remaining months that the United States remained technically at peace. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, she conducted her initial war patrols off the east coast based at Norfolk and at Charleston, South Carolina. The early part of the year 1942 found Tourmaline operating between Norfolk and Key West, Florida. On 29 June, she departed Key West to escort a convoy of merchant vessels to Norfolk. En route back toward Charleston, she assisted to pursue an underwater contact; but neither ship managed to locate the suspected U-boat. The yacht arrived at Charleston on 5 July. Her next mission called for her to escort a convoy to the British West Indies. She reached Trinidad with her charges on 26 July and patrolled in that vicinity through early August before sailing for Key West on the 12th of that month. After cruises on patrols in Florida waters, she departed Key West on 27 October‚Äîin company with , , and ‚Äîto escort five merchantmen to Havana, Cuba. Tourmaline next headed for New York, where she arrived on 7 November. She returned to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the 19th, establishing a pattern which lasted through much of her subsequent service in which she escorted convoys between New York and ports in the Caribbean. On 13 December 1942, five days out of New York, Tourmalines underwater sound gear picked up a strong metallic echo. She speeded to attack and dropped three depth charges before her steering gear was damaged. Forced to steer with her engines, the escort broke off the chase, and her quarry escaped. After the damage was repaired, Tourmaline resumed escort duty and continued convoy work until 25 January 1944. On that day, the yacht received orders to report to the 1st Naval District, where she joined the Naval Local Defense Force based at Boston, Massachusetts. For the remainder of 1944 and into June 1945, Tourmaline patrolled the waters off the Massachusetts coast through the end of the war in the Atlantic. Decommission Decommissioned on 18 July 1945, Tourmaline was temporarily laid-up at the Mystic Shipbuilding Company and Repair Yard, East Boston, Mass. Struck from the Navy list on 13 August 1945, she was transferred to the War Shipping Board, Maritime Commission, on 3 January 1946. On 23 January 1946, Andrew M. Embiricos and Manuel E. Kulukundis, of the Greek War Relief Association, Inc., purchased the yacht under its original name, Sylvia.

The subject matter of her best known work was primarily Arab female dancers. The majority of her career output in sculpture can be classified as being of the Art Deco style. Colinet was a frequent exhibitor at the Salon des Artistes Francais and Salon des Independents art exhibitions in Paris. Her sculptures, most of which depicted beautifully figured, energized, and dramatic female forms, were exhibited posthumously at the Paris Salon for nearly 30 years. Early life Colinet was born in Brussels, Belgium, in 1880. Little is known about her life other than the artwork she produced during a successful career that spanned more than 40 years. As a woman, she was in the minority in her chosen field of sculpture during the era in which she worked and lived. Career Bronze casting of Colinet's Sleep of Narcissus At an undetermined date ‚Äì probably around 1910 ‚Äì Colinet emigrated to Paris, France, where she studied sculpture under the watchful eye of Jef Lambeaux and exhibited for the first time at the Salon des Artistes Francais in 1913 and became a permanent member of the organization in 1929. From 1937 to 1940, she exhibited at the Salon des Independents in Paris and joined the Union of Women Painters and Sculptors. Colinet's work is primarily done in the Art Deco style, and her models included odalisques, exotic dancers, jugglers and artists of cabaret. A number of her female dancer pieces were influenced by a revival of the Orientalism movement which had been popular in Europe from about 1860 to 1880. Her preferred casting material was bronze; however, a number of her most distinguished sculptures are chryselephantine, being a combination of both bronze and ivory. Colinet's sculpture has become highly desirable to collectors and, increasingly, is selling for exorbitant sums. At a Christie's sale on 4 May 2007, her Ankara Dancer statue from circa 1930 sold for a hammer price of $285,984.

As Apostolic Vicariate it was exempt, i.e. directly dependent on the Holy See, and entitled to a titular bishop.  History  In the middle of the 19th century, historical region of Macedonia was under Ottoman rule, and its major part was organized as Salonica Eyalet. Among Eastern Orthodox Slavic population in European provinces of the Ottoman Empire, that was under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, there was a strong movement for internal ecclesiastical autonomy, and since Greek hierarchy was reluctant to fulfill those demands, a fraction of population left Eastern Orthodoxy and joined Eastern Catholicism. In 1859, the \\"Union of Kukush\\" occurred among local Bulgarians who converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Eastern Catholicism, that subsequently led to the creation of a particular ecclesiastical jurisdiction. In 1861, Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Constantinople was created for the Eastern-Catholic Bulgarians of the Byzantine Rite in European provinces of the Ottoman Empire, including the region of Macedonia. Under the Treaty of Berlin (1878), entire territory of Macedonia was left under Ottoman rule, as Salonica Vilayet. Since Ottoman government was obligated to allow more liberty for of all Christian denominations in the region, an opportunity arose for reorganization of religious institutions of local Eastern Catholic of Byzantine Rite. In 1883, a Byzantine-Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Macedonia was created, cowering the administrative territory of Salonica Vilayet. The new Apotolic Vicariate was split off from the jurisdiction of the Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Constantinople. In 1912, Ottoman rule over Macedonia ended, and the region was divided between Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria. During Balkan Wars (1912-1913) and First World War (1914-1918) the region was heavily afflicted, and administrative structure of the Vicariate was almost destroyed. From 1922 to 1926, the remains of local vicariates of Macedonia, Thrace and Constantinople were gradually suppressed and reorganized. Parts that remained under Greek and Serbian rule were incorporated into new ecclesiastical structures for Eastern Catholics. Northern parts of the Vicariate that belonged to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Kri≈æevci, while the eastern parts of the Vicariate, including major part of the Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Thrace (Hadrianopolis) was reestablished as the Bulgarian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Sofia, which thus became the only diocese, covering the entire particular church.

As an Masters student, she taught CS17si: Frontiers in Reproductive Technology, with the faculty sponsor Russ Altman. {title=CS 17si: Frontiers in Reproductive Technologyurl=https://reproductivetech.stanford.edu/accessdate=3 April 2019}} Entrepreneurship Noor Siddiqui started Remedy with her sister Gina Siddiqui, who took a leave of absence from University of Pennsylvania's medical school in order to join her. The company's initial product, an app named Beam, used Google Glass to let medical providers talk with each other and stream video. In a small pilot study, 91% of surgeons said that they found the app useful for managing treatments. Remedy later developed a mobile phone app that allowed primary care doctors to quickly consult with specialists over video chat, without needing Google Glass hardware. Siddiqui returned the funds raised to investors in order to attend Stanford University full time.

He is known mainly for his travelogue books ‚Äúby Vespa‚Äù, published in Italy and the Netherlands. Life Birdsall was born in West Yorkshire, England, and raised in Cross Hills. He was educated at Glusburn County Primary, South Craven Secondary, Sedbergh School and Durham University, where his studies in English literature left him with the intention of becoming a writer. Following a succession of jobs to gain materials for his stories, from road sweeper to bingo caller, he moved to Italy to study painting in Tuscany. He remained in Palaia twelve years, before moving to Winterthur, Switzerland in 2005. Writer Reviewing Birdsall's play Staggart Lane at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1987, Mario Relich wrote in The Scotsman that the playwright shows great potential. Birdsall's first novel Blue Charm was published by Blackstaff Press, Belfast, in 1995 and was shortlisted for the Authors' Club First Novel Award. This was followed by a series of travelogue books published by Arteventbook, Pisa: Tuscany by Vespa, 2005, La Mia Umbria in Vespa, 2007, Vespa Valdarno Tour, 2009.

His screenplay Galatea was filmed by the artist Jamie Boyd in 2005. Painter In Italy Birdsall lived and assisted in the studio of the Australian artist Arthur Boyd at Paretaio. Moving away from his earlier ‚ÄòFlorentine‚Äô mannerist style, in recent years he has painted on small wooden panels with the palette knife technique inspired by the nineteenth century Tuscan Macchiaioli group of 'plein air' artists who painted on old cigar box lids. His travelogue books are illustrated with his characteristic 15x30cm oils on panel that can easily fit onto the back of a Vespa. Birdsall has exhibited paintings in one man shows and group exhibitions in several countries since the early nineties. Birdsall's interest in art may have been inspired by his uncle Timothy Birdsall, a notable cartoonist and illustrator who worked for The Sunday Times, The Spectator and appeared in the BBC satirical show \\"That Was the Week that Was\\".

Burnley's appearance was their first in the Charity Shield, thought they have since won the competition twice. This was the first Charity Shield match played between the league champions and FA Cup champions, which would from 1930 onwards become the standard format of the competition.

A much lower attendance on the previous season was achieved, however, with poor bank holiday rail services and hot weather blamed. Tottenham had won the Second Division in 1920, which had qualified them for the previous season's Charity Shield. In their first season in the First Division they finished in a strong 6th place and won their second FA Cup. Burnley's 1921 championship win was their first of two to date, having been the runner-up in the previous season. In the match, Tottenham's technical was game more suited to the weather.

Biography She spent most of her career in the editorials for foreign policy issues at TV Zagreb and later Croatian Radiotelevision. In 2005 she received the Maja Miles Prize for Journalism for her selection of topics that bring new and different sensibilities to the Croatian public space and raise the awareness about human rights and position of women at global level. In her career, among many others, she interviewed Yasser Arafat, Margaret Thatcher and Muammar Gaddafi. The Croatian Parliament appointed Mirjana Rakiƒá as president of the Council for Electronic Media and the director of the Agency for Electronic Media on February 1, 2014 with a mandate until February 3, 2019. Opposition MPs of the Croatian Democratic Union voted against the appointment of Rakiƒá, claiming that she said that in her view Franjo Tudjman was a war criminal. Before she became head of the Agency for Electronic Media, Rakiƒá was executive director of the Croatian Radiotelevision. Mirjana Rakiƒá was openly supportive of Croatian membership in the European Union during the negotiation process for full EU membership. In an interview that she gave in December 2015 to the Croatian Journalists' Association she stated that in her career she never worked for commercial media outlets. In another interview Rakiƒá said that she was an ethnic Serbian and a member of the League of Communists of Croatia, but nevertheless due to her professionalism managed to preserve her workplace in the last decade of the 20th century when many other colleagues for the same reasons lost their jobs. In 2015 Mirjana Rakiƒá has held the position of President of the Mediterranean Network of Regulatory Authorities whose members are sent by national media regulatory bodies from Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Cyprus, Turkey, Moldova, Greece, Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Italy, Tunisia, France, Morocco, Spain and Portugal. Revocation of Z1 TV license and demonstrations In January 2016, during Mirjana Rakiƒá's mandate, the Council for Electronic Media punished Z1 Television suspending its concession for three days because of hate speech, after the journalist of the local television Marko Juriƒá warned the citizens not to walk near the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of the Transfiguration of the Lord, because \\"their children could become victims of ƒåetnik slaughter\\". Following the decision of the Council nationalist demonstrations were organized in which by police estimates about 5,000 people gathered, many of them shouting the Usta≈°a salute Za dom spremni while the leader of the protesters Velimir Bujanec gave a ƒåetnik hat to Mirjana Rakiƒá. The new Vice-President of the Croatian Parliament Ivan Tepe≈° from the right-wing Croatian Party of Rights dr. Ante Starƒçeviƒá took also part in the demonstrations.

Radio Congo Belge was established in L√©opoldville (modern-day Kinshasa) as a means of broadcasting news and propaganda to the white population of the Congo and German-occupied Belgium in World War II. It broadcast for the first time on 1 October 1940. However, this role was assumed by Radiodiffusion nationale belge (RNB) in May 1943 which also broadcast from L√©opoldville and Radio Congo Belge became more focused on broadcasting within the colony. It played an important role in providing Congolese musicians with access to foreign musical influences. It was particularly influential in introducing Afro-Cuban music into the Congo through groups such as Septeto Habanero and Trio Matamoros. According to historian Gary Stewart, Radio Congo Belge, together with Radio Brazzaville and Congolia, \\"contributed to the critical mix of music taking shape on the banks of the Congo River\\". The station has also been described as an \\"important promotional outlet for local music\\" which allowed Congolese bands and recording studios to emerge. After the independence of Congo- L√©opoldville in 1960, the station was renamed Radiodiffusion Congolaise (\\"Congolese Radio Broadcasting\\").

Having completed her diploma, Jones attended and passed a selection for those seeking ordination in the Church in Wales. She then studied theology at Cardiff University. In 1990, she entered Queen's College, Birmingham, an ecumenical theological college, to train for ordained ministry. She could not train at St. Michael's College, Llandaff, the Anglican theological college in Wales, because it did not have accommodation for women until later years. Following ordination, Jones continued with her university studies. She studied theology at the University of Wales, Bangor, graduating with a Bachelor of Theology (BTh) degree in 1996. She studied at Northumbria University and completed a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in 2011. She studied at the University of Leeds, graduating with a Master of Arts (MA) degree in 2013. Ordained ministry In 1992, Jones was ordained in the Church in Wales as a deacon during a service in Bangor Cathedral. From 1992 to 1994, she served her curacy in the Rectorial Benefice of Holyhead, Anglesey, in the Diocese of Bangor. She then moved to Bangor, Gwynedd, and, from 1994 to 1999, worked as a chaplain of Ysbyty Gwynedd (). In addition, she was a curate of the Benefice of Bangor between 1994 and 1995, and Priest-in-Charge of St. Peter's Church in the Benefice between 1995 and 1999. She was ordained as a priest in 1997. In 1999, Jones became Vicar of the Parish of Betws y Coed, Dolwyddelan, Penmachno and Capel Curig. The parish includes St Gwyddelan's Church, Dolwyddelan, St Mary's Church, Betws-y-Coed, and St Tudclud's Church, Penmachno. She had originally believed that she would only stay in the appointment for two years and then return to chaplaincy. However, she actually spent the next seven years in parish ministry. On 19 September 2015, Jones was announced as the next Dean of Bangor. On 30 January 2016, she was installed as the 57th Dean during a service in the Cathedral Church of Saint Deiniol, Bangor.

The World report on disability, published in 2011, said about 25 million Nigerians had at least one disability, while 3.6 million of these had very significant difficulties in functioning. The 2006 Nigerian census reported 3,253,169 people with disabilities, or 2.32% of the total population of 140,431,790 in that year. However, the Centre for Citizens with Disabilities, a Nigerian NGO, claims the census did not capture the full extent of disability in Nigeria, and has called on Nigeria's National Population Commission to cooperate with the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development for the 2016 census in order to measure disability more accurately. As at 2020, there are reportedly over 27 million Nigerians living with some form of disability. The five most common types of disabilities in Nigeria are, in descending order, visual impairment, hearing impairment, physical impairment, intellectual impairment, and physical impairment. Nigeria ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 30 March 2007 and its Optional Protocol on 24 September 2010. The Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development is charged with submitting reports on progress, but has yet to do so as of 2013. A 2008 study by the United Kingdom Department for International Development found that the public, the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, and disabled people's organizations (DPOs) in Nigeria understood disability within a discourse of welfare and charity. This is as opposed to emphasis on social adaptation, inclusion, and empowerment as advocated by the social model of disability that is generally favored in the field of disability studies. It also found that two national umbrella DPOs, the Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAWPD) and the Association for the Comprehensive Empowerment of Nigerians with Disabilities (ASCEND), often strongly disagreed while both presuming to speak on behalf of all Nigerians with disabilities, impeding their ability to lobby the government. Nine years after Nigeria ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the President General Muhammadu Buhari into law the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act 2018. The Law enshrined recommendations of Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities while awarding punitive damages to victims of discriminations living with disabilities.

Two were ordered by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS) and three by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) History In planning the launch of the TEE services, it was decided to use diesel-powered fixed sets for the new trains. While the French and the Italians refined existing designs, the Germans introduced a new design, the VT 11.5. The Swiss and Dutch railways cooperated on a joint development for a new 4-car diesel-electric trainset. The design comprised: * A power car with compartments for luggage, customs and the train conductor. * A nine-compartment trailer car (54 seats) * A kitchen-restaurant trailer car with a 32-seat dining section, and an 18-seat first-class open saloon * A driving trailer car with 42-seat open saloon, and a staff sleeping compartment. All 114 seats were first class, with 2+1 seating in the saloons, and 2+2 in the dining section. The power cars were built by Werkspoor, with electrics by Brown, Boveri & Cie; they were powered by a pair of RUHB diesel engines. A third diesel engine of provided power for heating, lighting, air- conditioning and the kitchen in the dining car. The trailer cars were built by Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG); the design was based on the SBB's standard carriage design (Einheitswagen I) due to the short time available for design and construction. Only one entrance vestibule was provided at the front end of the cars, doors were of the folding aluminum type, and windows were double-glazed with a passenger-operated venetian blinds between the panes. The sets were equipped with Scharfenberg couplers, and were geared for a maximum speed of . They were painted in the TEE colours of dark red (RAL 3004 purpurrot) and cream (RAL 1001 beige). Ownership of the sets was down-played in favour of the service ‚Äì the restaurant cars having TRANS EUROPE EXPRESS lettering above the windows, while the owner (SBB-CFF-FFS or NS) and fleet number were only marked by small lettering on the power cars Service Halfweg-Zwanenburg From 2 June 1957 to 30 May 1964 the five sets were used in a four-day service pool as follows: * Day 1: ** TEE 30 Edelweiss ‚Äî Z√ºrich HB ‚Äì Basel SBB ‚Äì Strasbourg ‚Äì ‚Äì Brussels-Nord ‚Äì Amsterdam CS * Day 2 ** TEE 128 L'√âtoile du Nord ‚Äî Amsterdam CS ‚Äì Paris-Nord ** TEE 145 L'Oiseau Bleu ‚Äî Paris-Nord ‚Äì Brussels-Midi * Day 3 ** TEE 108 L'Oiseau Bleu ‚Äî Bruxelles-Midi ‚Äì Paris-Nord ** TEE 125 L'√âtoile du Nord ‚Äî Paris-Nord ‚Äì Amsterdam CS * Day 4 ** TEE 31 Edelweiss : Amsterdam CS ‚Äì Z√ºrich HB * Day 5 ** Maintenance layover in Z√ºrich One curious feature of this pool was the use of Swiss-Dutch stock on a Franco-Belgian route. When a RAm/DE4 set was unavailable, an SNCF locomotive with a set of was substituted. From 31 May 1964, the L'Oiseau Bleu went to permanently locomotive-hauled Inox coaches, whereupon the service pool became: * Day 1: ** TEE 30 Edelweiss ‚Äî Z√ºrich HB ‚Äì Amsterdam CS * Day 2 ** TEE 122 L'√âtoile du Nord ‚Äî Amsterdam CS ‚Äì Paris-Nord ** TEE 125 L'√âtoile du Nord ‚Äî Paris-Nord ‚Äì Amsterdam CS * Day 3 ** TEE 31 Edelweiss : Amsterdam CS ‚Äì Z√ºrich HB The spare and maintenance sets were stationed ant Z√ºrich and Amsterdam.

Accidents and incidents *In August 1961 SBB 501 caught fire, and was out of service for 176 days until January 1962. * ‚Äì On 9 February 1971 SBB 501 was running as the northbound Bavaria with 53 passengers on board. Running trailer-first on the double track Munich‚ÄìLindau line, it entered an S-curve near Aitrang at about and derailed, fouling both lines. It was then struck by a VT98 Uerdingen railbus. Twenty- eight were killed and 42 were seriuosuly injured. Of the fatalities, 26 were in the TEE, 2 in the railbus, and included both drivers, and the German actor/director Leonard Steckel. The cause, although not known for certain, was assumed to be brake failure, possible caused by condensation freezing in the air-brake lines. The three trailers were scrapped on site; the power car as taken to Tilburg works, but was later condemned and scrapped. End of TEE service As from 26 May 1974, TEE discontinued the use of diesel trainsets on all its services. The three Dutch and the surviving Swiss set were stored at Utrecht until another use or a buyer could be found. A plan by NS to convert them to electric operation come to nothing. In 1977, all four were sold to the Ontario Northland Railway (ONT) of Canada. Northlander One of the sets in Canada, May 1978 The four trainsets were shipped to Canada, and after being modified to make them compliant with Canadian railway standards, they entered Ontario Northland service on the Northlander between Toronto Union Station and Timmins. Unfortunately the power cars proved unsatisfactory - they could not cope with the harsh Canadian winters, and the maintenance crews were unfamiliar with the European equipment. In 1979, the power cars were replaced with standard EMD FP7 diesel locomotives; the driving trailers were not adapted to work with the new power, and so became purely locomotive-hauled stock, and continued in service until February 1992. Repatriation One driving trailer has been repainted into red and cream. Zwolle, February 2008 The Swiss foundation TEE Classics bought eight cars to restore a trainset to its original condition. Five cars were repatriated to Europe: * One car of former NS 1001; * The control car of former NS 1002; * The three cars of the former NS 1003. They were loaded onto the Norwegian cargo ship and sailed from Saint John, New Brunswick on 19 October 1998, arriving at Hamburg on 5 November. After standing in Hamburg docks for several months due to having Canadian rather than European wheel profiles, they were moved to Heilbronn. One of the driving trailers was restored and displayed at the Swiss Museum of Transport in Lucerne. In June 2006 the TEE Netherlands Foundation brought all five cars together at Zwolle for restoration. One of the trailer cars was repainted back into the TEE red and cream livery to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the trainsets introduction. They also plan to construct a new powercar to replace the missing originals, none of which survive. Models Models of the RAm have been manufactured by M√§rklin and Roco in HO scale and by Trix in both HO scale, and (under their Minitrix brand) in N.

The story follows a Scottish woman who, after learning her missing sister was working as a sex worker, sets out to examine the sex industry. Fishnet was the winner of the Guardian Not the Booker Prize 2015. Innes spoke at the Edinburgh International Book Festival 2015 about Fishnet. In August 2018, Fishnet was re-published by Black & White Publishing, following the liquidation of Freight Books in December 2017.  Background  Innes conducted three years of research to complete Fishnet. Along with online research, she conducted interviews with sex workers and sex workers' rights activists and advocates. Innes had admitted that before researching the Scottish sex industry, she maintained the common misconception that all sex workers are victims. After further research, Innes had stated that her 'politics were completely flipped on their heads'. This change of perception is evident in the critical reception of Fishnet as critics often applaud Innes for approaching sex workers in a nuanced way.  Plot summary  Twenty-year- old Rona Leonard leaves her sister Fiona's flat and disappears. Six years later, Fiona lives a mundane existence, struggling through a tedious office job and child care. Her life suddenly changes when she learns Rona was working as a sex worker. On a journey to uncover the truth about her sister, Fiona investigates the sex industry and meets with sex workers. Her misconceptions of the sex industry are challenged, and what she uncovers changes her life forever.  Reception  Fishnet won the Guardian Not the Booker Prize 2015. The Independent included Fishnet on its Christmas 2015: The top 10 debut fiction books list. James Kidd from The Independent compared Fishnet to Trainspotting, the novel by Irvine Welsh about Scottish heroin users, as it portrays a 'clandestine world (here, prostitution in Scotland) against the every day.' Journalist Iain MacWhirter wrote in The Herald that Fishnet challenged public misconceptions about sex workers as victims. Laura Lee from The Huffington Post applauded Innes's nuanced representation of sex workers. Fishnet has been praised for its use of dialogue and Scottish vernacular, and criticised for its use of present tense and 'lectures on prostitution in the guise of blog entries'.

Description It has a slender body, around 2 cm in length, with long legs and a long proboscis. It is yellow-brown in color. Behavior When disturbed, the bug gives off an unpleasant smell in defense. Females lay around 100‚Äì200 eggs on the leaves of the rice plant (Oryza sativa). The eggs hatch into green-colored nymphs, which gradually turn brown as they grow into adults. However, these bugs can sometimes be seen feeding on other plants.  Pest status  Rice bugs can be a significant pest to the rice plant, as they feed-on the developing rice ears: reducing crop quality and sometimes yield. Because attacks occur near to harvest, if farmers spray insecticides in an attempt to control outbreaks, they risk leaving harmful pesticide residues on the crop.

He became Lord Mayor of London and Governor of the Bank of England. Early years Bateman was the son of Joas (anglicised to Joseph) Bateman of Tooting and his second wife, Judith de la Barre, daughter of John de la Barre, merchant, of Fenchurch Street. He was born and baptised the same day at St Martin Orgar in London. His father was a Flemish immigrant who had become a successful London merchant and alderman. Bateman built upon his father's mercantile business. From about 1683 or 1684 he was living at Alicante in Portugal, where he was involved in the wine trade. By the early 1690s he was back in London with a considerable fortune and carried on as an importer of wine from the Iberian peninsula. He married Esther Searle, the daughter and coheiress of John Searle, a Finchley merchant by licence dated 3 December 1691. Career Shobdon Court service block Bateman became an important player in the City of London and, subscribing to the Bank of England on its foundation in 1694, became one of its founding directors.Governors of the Bank of England.

However, he was nearly impeached in 1695 because of his involvement with the Company of Scotland. He was active in establishing an alternative East India Company and in 1698 was a founding director of the New East Indies Company. He was knighted on 14 December 1698. At the first general election of 1701 he stood unsuccessfully at St Mawes. He seems to have decided to concentrate on City politics instead and was appointed Sheriff of London for 1701 to 1702, elected Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for 1703 to 1705 and Governor for 1705 to 1707. In 1705 he bought the Shobdon estate in Herefordshire and replaced the Jacobean house with a new Palladian style building, of which only the service block has survived. He resumed his position as a director of the Bank of England in 1707 until 1711. In 1708, he became an alderman and a member of the Loriners‚Äô Company. He was a director of the United East India Company from 1709 to 1710, a prime warden of the Fishmongers‚Äô Company for 1710 to 1712 and resigned as Director of the Bank of England in 1711 to become a sub-Governor of the South Sea Company until his death. Bateman stood unsuccessfully for Parliament for London at the 1710 general election. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ilchester at a by-election on 2 June 1711, and was returned again at the 1713 general election. At the 1715 general election, he was defeated in a contest at Ilchester but was returned as MP for East Looe. He was elected Lord Mayor of London for 1716 to 1717. Death and legacy Bateman died in 1718. He had four sons and three daughters. His estates in Herefordshire, Kent and Essex were divided between his sons.

In addition to that Vestermanis received religious education from a rabbi at the age of 6 until he turned 15. His father had most of his possessions confiscated by the Soviet authorities after Latvia's occupation in 1940. Upon the arrival of the Wehrmacht after the Nazi occupation of Latvia in 1941, the family was taken to the Riga Ghetto, where Marƒ£ers had to work as a homemaker, assisting the underground resistance movement of the ghetto at the same time.

In the region of Palestine, the use of wine was not only an important factor in religious ritual, but also a necessity for social interaction, general dietary consumption and medicinal purposes. During the Byzantine period, large-scale production led to international commerce in the commodity, and Palestinian wine was exported around the Mediterranean region. Production by Christians diminished with the Islamic conquest in the 7th century and was temporarily revived with the settlement of Frankish Christians under the Crusades in the 1100s. Jews continued to cultivate vineyards in the late 15th century into the Ottoman period. The first modern wineries were established by German settlers at Sarona (now a neighborhood of Tel Aviv in Israel) in 1874/5 and by Jews at Rishon LeZion (also in Israel) in 1882.  Antiquity  Plan and sections of an ancient Canaan wine press Ancient Egypt was supplied with Canaan wine as early as the Early and Late Bronze Ages. Many Canaan wine jugs were discovered at Abydos, Egypt inside the royal Umm el-Qa'ab tombs of the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt (c. 3100 BCE), suggesting that wine from Canaan was a crucial part of elite banquets. Wine offerings were a common feature of Near Eastern ancient worship. Egyptians from the 15th century BCE described the wine of Canaan as being \\"more abundant than water.\\" Wine was also to be used later in the Jewish sacrificial ritual to supplement other offerings.  Roman and Byzantine period  Roman-era Palestinian amphorae, Bodrum Castle, Turkey Vines were among the three major crops cultivated in Roman and Byzantine Palestine and there are numerous remains of ancient winery installations. Wine was produced throughout the region, from the fertile plains in the north, to the arid areas of the Negev. In Akhziv, an enormous press with the capacity for 59,000 litres was dated to the 4th century. Archaeology suggests that there was a substantial increase in production in the early Byzantine period and most the large-scale presses date to this era. The rabbis of the Talmudic era devoted much attention to wine production and commerce and instituted many laws religious pertaining to it. Although the Talmud states that \\"the wine of Tyre was cheaper than Palestinian wine,\\" nowhere does it mention that wine was ever exported abroad. Various other sources from the Byzantine period reveal that this indeed occurred. Around the mid-fourth century, the anonymous writer of Expositio totius mundi et gentium states: \\"Ashkelon and Gaza‚Ä¶export the best wine to all Syria and Egypt.\\" Transport jars or amphorae have been found in large quantities at various Mediterranean sites, at harbours and as parts of shipwrecked cargos off the shores of Cyprus, Greece and Asia Minor. Significant international trade in Palestinian wine started in the early 5th century, and lasted another 250 years. The deposits of Palestinian amphorae in foreign regions is substantial. They show that Palestinian wines were exported as far as Spain, Gaul and even Wales. In this period, they accounted for 45% of amphorae found in Carthage, 20% at 6th-century Argos and Marseille and 16% at Naples in the 7th century. It is assumed that the Palestinian Bag Jar, one of the most common forms of pottery to be found in the southern Levant, carried white Palestinian wine when exported. John the Almsgiver (7th-cent.) is said to have admired the aromatic bouquet of the expensive Palestinian wine he was offered in Alexandria. Coming from the land of the Bible, Palestinian wine appealed to Christian priests for use during the Eucharist.  Islamic and Crusader period  In the late 7th century, the Western Church stopped using Palestinian wine, probably because it became too expensive or unavailable after the Arab invasion. During the first Islamic centuries, wine continued to be produced and was not only consumed by Christians and Jews, but by Muslims as well, who compiled \\"wine poems\\" in their honour. In the later periods of Muslim domination, wine making diminished as the cultivation of vineyards was either restricted or was forbidden by religious Islamic law. An ancient press vat found at Rechovot (in Israel) indicates that it went out of use during the 8th-9th centuries, it being used instead as a rubbish pit. When the Crusaders took Palestine in the 12th century, the demand for wine by the Latin Church and among the Frankish city-dwellers made vine-growing a lucrative business once again. The Franks established vine-growing settlements and even after they abandoned their colony at Ramathes (modern day Al-Ram) in 1187, it continued to produce wine until the late 15th century. Meshullam of Volterra (1481) found that in Gaza, only the Jews were involved in the production of wine.  Ottoman era and British Mandate Winemaking in Zikhron Yaakov, 1890s = 1500s‚Äì1700s = In the 16th century, although the Ottoman authorities forbade wine consumption by Muslims, they tolerated its sale to non-Muslims. Later, in 1754, an Ottoman regulation aimed at preventing drunkenness and immodesty, prohibited Jews from selling wine to Muslims or Christians. = 1800s‚Äì1900s = The mid-19th century saw a rapid expansion of grape cultivation, mostly by Jewish farmers. Rabbi Isaac Schorr founded a modern Palestinian winery in Jerusalem in 1848. The same year, a Palestinian messenger (i.e. a Jewish community representative) on a fund-raising mission to Jamaica brought with him 32 barrels of Palestinian wine, with the proceeds from its sale going to relief for the Jews back in Palestine. In 1870, Rabbi Abraham Tepperberg founded the Efrat winery in the Old City of Jerusalem and the Jewish Agricultural School at Mikveh Israel began growing the first vines of European variety. Label on wine produced in Sarona, ca. 1920. The German Templers who founded a colony at Sarona in 1871 adopted viticulture as one of their industries.Glenk et al. (2005), passim. They introduced the first wine factory and the first modern wine cellars into Palestine. In 1874/5 a winery co-operative was formed and the first winery and cellars were built.Glenk et al. (2005), pp. 30‚Äì31. A second winery was built in 1890 and export of wine to Germany began. In 1898 a new larger winery was built by the Deutsche Weinbaugenossenschaft Sarona-Jaffa (German Winegrowers' Co-operative of Sarona-Jaffa).Glenk et al. (2005), p. 38'. By the end of the 1890s, there were 150 hectares of vineyards producing 4000 hectoliters (106,000 US gallons) annually. The new Templer settlement of Wilhelma was added to the wine cooperative in 1902.Glenk et al. (2005), p. 49. Wine production at Sarona and Wilhelma continued during the British Mandate, with overseas sales mostly to southern Germany.Glenk et al. (2005), p. 126. Jewish vine cultivation on a large commercial scale began in 1882 with the opening of the Carmel Winery in Rishon LeZion. It was the initiative of Baron Edmond James de Rothschild who invested millions of francs to develop Palestinian viticulture, the growing and the production of wines and cognacs. American vine stocks were imported upon which French shoot were grafted. French experts were brought over to assist in the project. A large wine cellar was built and modern machinery was installed. Rothschild was nevertheless forced to purchase Palestinian wine at above-market prices to keep the operation viable. Palestine Wine remains a prominent choice for British Jews today.The first kosher and Israeli wine brand \\"Palwin is the name of the first kosher and Israeli wine brand. It has now flourished in three separate centuries, the 19th, 20th and 21st, but outside Great Britain, it is scarcely known. However Palwin became part of the history and fabric of Jewish communal life in the United Kingdom and there is no British Jew, who is not familiar with Palwin wines. It became as strong a brand in the UK, as Manischevitz was in the USA. If Manischevitz is the byword for Kiddush wine in America, Palwin is the same in England. Palwin wines were launched in the 19th century and they were prominent in every Jewish home throughout the 20th century. Even at the beginning of the 21st century, Palwin still features prominently, despite all the new quality options the wine lover has to choose from.‚Äù Kosher red wine was sweet and lacking in sophistication. British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli remarked that it tasted \\"not so much like wine, but more like what I expect to receive from my doctor as a remedy for a bad winter cough.\\"A History of Wine, Daniel Rogov. JVL. Other wineries established in this period and still functioning today include the Cremisan Monastery, near Bethlehem, where Italian Salesian monks have been making wine since 1885 and the Latrun Monastery where French Trappist monks began winemaking in 1899. Vineyard acreage in the Jewish sector totalled around 11,000 dunam in 1890 and around 26,000 dunam by 1900. Bozwin advert, Jewish Chronicle, 1930s In 1883, M. Chaikin & Co. was founded in the United Kingdom. It imported wine produced in Petah Tikva bearing the name \\"Bozwin\\" (Beauty of Zion Wine). In 1898, another London company, the Palestine Wine Trading Co., was established. A \\"wine-war\\" erupted between the two British companies, both claiming the exclusive importation of kosher Palestinian wine., note 20. Today, Palwin, an abbreviation for \\"Palestine wine\\"Wine Talk: History in a bottle and produced by Carmel Winery, is Israel's oldest brand, producing 100,000 bottles every year.(Robyn Rosen) Sorry, Palwin lives to flay your palate another day, Jewish Chronicle, August 27, 2009. Palestinian wine received the gold medal at the Paris Exposition of 1900. By 1903, wine constituted Palestine‚Äôs third-largest export and continued to be a key economic commodity. The Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol Problem (1929) stated that Palestinian wine was intoxicating, contrary to statements which asserted that it is \\"so light and pure, that a person may drink almost any quantity of it without feeling any unpleasant effects.\\" Before World War I, the United States and Russia were the largest markets for Palestine wine. Due to the war and with the advent of Prohibition in the United States in 1920, the market declined dramatically. In the early 1920s, American Orthodox Jewish congregations unsuccessfully petitioned the authorities to allow the import of Palestinian wine for sacramental use over the Passover holiday. Large stocks of unsold wine was being used to make jam and concentrated grape juice for the European markets. In December 1926, the US prohibition department allowed the import of Palestinian kosher wine, which was obtained by Jews through the rabbis of their congregations. The Repeal of Prohibition in 1933 led to an American contract with Rothschild winery which initially provided for the importation of one million bottles of wines and liquor from Palestine over three years, a $15,000,000 concern. The contract was later revised to allow for the import of for 3,000,000 bottles in 1934 alone. Early 1934 saw a 30% increase in the export of Palestinian wine, most of it shipped to the US, from where Palestine had been receiving \\"urgent requests for tens of thousands of bottles of Jewish wine.\\" In order to meet the demand, Palestinian vintners planned to establish new areas in Samaria for grape cultivation. The lifting of the Prohibition in the United States and permission to import Palestinian wine rejuvenated the wine growing business in Palestine. Yet, in Poland, sales of Palestinian wine reached a record low in 1936 owing to poverty among Jewish buyers. In March 1936, the issue of whether increasing alcohol consumption in Palestine was arousing resentment among the Arabs was raised in the House of Commons. The Colonial Secretary rejected a request that the issuance of retail liquor sale licenses in Palestine be halted. When food distribution was disrupted during WWII, Jewish merchants in Palestine agreed to exchange 500 tons of potatoes from Syria for the equivalent in wine.  Modern industry  Nadim Khoury, a Palestinian who is known for establishing Taybeh Brewery, has also opened a winery in the West Bank Christian majority village of Taybeh. Using 21 indigenous varieties of grapes, the wines produced were quick to gain visitors' praise. Khoury admits that Israeli restrictions has made it difficult to do business, his shipments for example, including his wine-making equipment, have been delayed because of Israeli checkpoint inspections. Other problems that the business owners endure, is difficulty shipping to the United States, due to the fact that there is no free trade agreement between the two countries. A wine festival is now held annually in the town.

Built in 1876 for two local banks, with a new fourth floor added in 1896, it is a significant local example of Italianate and Romanesque architecture, designed by Bangor architect George W. Orff. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The Bank Block is located in the heart of Dexter's central business district, on the north side of Main Street (Maine State Route 23). It is a four-story masonry structure, with brick upper floors and ground floor retail spaces of glass, granite and metal. The ground floor is seven bays wide, articulated by a combination of iron and stone pilasters. Entrances are in the leftmost bay and the central bay, set in paneled recesses, and the remaining bays have glass display windows. The pilasters support a granite lintel, above which the brick portion of the building rises. The upper floors are five bays wide, with brick quoining at the corners and flanking the central bay. Second and third floor windows are set in segmented-arch openings, with Italianate brick hoods and bracketed stone sills. The fourth floor is separated from the others by a brick stringcourse, and has tripled round-arch Romanesque windows in the outer two bays, and a single round-arch window in the center bay. The cornice consists of corbelled brickwork. The Bank Block was built in 1876 as a joint project by the Dexter Savings Bank (founded 1867) and the First National Bank (1875). The ground floor was dedicated to retail space, the second floor to the offices of the two banks, and the upper floors housed the local Masonic lodge. Designed by Bangor architect George W. Orff, the top floor was originally mansarded in the Second Empire style, with gabled dormers. The Masonic facilities were gutted by a fire in early 1896, and the upper portion of the building was subsequently rebuilt to a design by Henry Dexter, a local builder. The building housed banks until the mid-1990s.

Whitley (August 6, 1834 ‚Äì April 19, 1919) was the second Chief of the United States Secret Service. Early life Whitley was born in Camden, Maine on August 6, 1834 to Dr William Whitley, a Glasgow-born doctor and surgeon, and Hannah D. McCoombs, a Maine local. In 1840, his family moved to Lake County, Ohio, where he became a pupil at the Western Reserve Teachers' Seminary, a Mormon teaching school in Kirtland. Leaving school at the age of fifteen, he became a drover for two years, after which he moved to Massachusetts where he worked for his uncle in the fishing industry at Gloucester. In 1856, Whitley married Catherine Webster (Katie) Bates of Cambridge; they subsequently had two daughters, Katie and Sabra. The following year, the Whitleys moved to the recently founded Lawrence, Kansas, where he worked in the grocery trade. In 1859, being drawn to Pike's Peak Gold Rush, Whitley sold out of his grocery business and moved to Colorado, where he failed to strike gold. Moving on, the Whitleys settled in New Orleans, with Whitley working the Red River as a steamboatman. Civil War In the year from April 1861, when the Civil War commenced, through to April 1862, Whitley continued to work the Red River. He professed some sympathy for the Confederacy, and drilled with local companies without seeing active service. He was on the Starlight at Shreveport, from New Orleans when it was seized by a Confederate committee, who aimed to use it to blockade the river against Yankee forces. Having heard of the Union Army's April 25 capture of New Orleans, Whitley, the \\"mulatto\\" second cook, and another \\"liberty loving African\\", stole the steamer's yawl. Travelling mainly by night, they reached New Orleans in seven days. There, Whitley reported to Major General B.F. Butler. Butler referred him to the provost-marshal of the Department of the Gulf, Colonel Jonas H. French, who employed Whitley as a detective. Whitley declined an offer of a captaincy in the Fifth Louisiana Regiment by the General in charge of New Orleans's defence, William H. Emory. Instead, he was appointed as a Major in the Seventh Louisiana Regiment. U.S. Secret Service Whitley was appointed Director of the United States Secret Service by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869, four years after its inception. Under Whitley, the Secret Service introduced criminal files, a written Code of Conduct, and an official badge for its agents. Whitley, whose successful arrest of 12 Klansmen in Georgia for the murder of a leading local Republican official had led to his appointment by Grant, used talented detectives who infiltrated and broke up KKK units in North Carolina and Alabama. However they could not penetrate the main hotbed of KKK activity in upstate South Carolina. Grant sent in Army troops but Whitley's agents learned that KKK members were lying low until the troops were withdrawn. Informed of this by Whitley, Grant's Attorney General Amos T. Akerman convinced Grant to declare martial law and send in US marshals backed by federal troops to arrest 500 Klansmen; hundred more fled the state, and hundreds of others surrendered in return for leniency.

Whitley was allegedly part of the so-called 1874 safe burglary conspiracy. He resigned as Director (being succeeded by Elmer Washburn) and faced trial for conspiracy, which ended with a hung jury. The DC Supreme Court subsequently found the grand jury which indited Whitley and others to have been illegally drawn, and the Attorney-General ordered nolle prosequi for the case.

These events, which included iconic locations such as Millennium Bridge in London, Purana Qila in New Delhi, Largo da Batata square in S√£o Paulo, and outside the United Nations building itself in New York City saw over 250,000 people take to the streets. Through these actions, action/2015 showed that these goals have a real public constituency behind them. With diverse communities and sectors ‚Äì from development, to climate, to human rights - joining hands, action/2015 also set the narrative around the Sustainable Development Goals, highlighting how the three core issues of our time - poverty, inequality and climate change - are interlinked. That addressing climate change, and ending poverty and inequalities are two sides of the same coin. We can't deliver sustainable development without tackling climate change, and we can't tackle climate change without addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality and unsustainable development patterns. In his address to the UN Special summit on behalf of civil society the head of Amnesty International referenced the action/2015 mobilisation, saying \\"Thousands of people marched last night for the Sustainable Development Goals to light the way. They called for authentic leadership from you, leadership with integrity, leadership from the heart. I know that you can live up to their hopes.\\" action/2015 campaigners participate in a Global Climate March in Kampala, Uganda =UN Climate Change Conference= On 28 and 29 November 2015, as governments of over 190 countries prepared to deliver a historic new global climate agreement at COP21 in Paris, the action/2015 movement joined with thousands around the world for the Global Climate March. 785,000 people marched at over 2,300 events in 175 countries, making it the biggest climate mobilisation in history. This included over 60,000 people in Melbourne, 100,000 in India, over 50,000 in London, 2,500 in Chile, and over 20,000 in Malawi. In Uganda, action/2015 was a key organiser of the Climate March in Kampala, echoing the call for climate action from Pope Francis, who was in the country as part of his first trip to Africa.

Intended as part of the family of EMUs descended from the prototype \\"PEP\\" stock, the class was never proceeded with as the planned services for which it was to be built were cancelled. Background=\\"Picc-Vic\\" proposal= In 1971, the South-East Lancashire and North-East Cheshire (SELNEC) Passenger Transport Executive, the body responsible for public transport in and around the Greater Manchester area, proposed the construction of a new underground railway tunnel intended to link Manchester's two remaining major railway termini, Piccadilly and Victoria, to create a new urban metro network. This tunnel, nicknamed the \\"Picc-Vic\\", was intended to link the disparate rail networks to the north (from Victoria) and south (from Piccadilly) of the city for the first time, allowing services through the Manchester city centre. At the time, the planned routes that would have been joined to the tunnel were a mix of electrified and non-electrified; the Bury Line, from Victoria, used a unique, 1200 V DC third rail system; the Buxton line was unelectrified, while the Styal, Crewe and Stafford lines were all electrified using 25 kV AC from overhead wires (OHLE). The proposal would have seen the entire planned network run using OHLE, which had recently opened on the West Coast Main Line as far as Manchester Piccadilly. As a consequence of this, new rolling stock was planned to operate the proposed services. =PEP rolling stock= A prototype 4-PEP Class 445 pictured in 1975 Because of the requirements of operating in the central tunnel section, the initial SELNEC specification for new trains stated that they would require both sliding doors and end connections, which did not feature together on then current rolling stock operated by British Rail. The initial publicity for the Picc-Vic plan, which was described as \\"Manchester's tube project\\", showed an artist's impression of a platform with a train resembling the 1967 Stock, as used on the Victoria line in London. However, the twin bore tunnels were intended to be built with a diameter of , large enough to accommodate both a main line train type, and the OHLE wires. At the same time, British Rail was in the midst of testing a new suburban train type in the Southern Region. These prototype units, eventually designated as Class 445 and 446 under TOPS, were different from any previous rolling stock: they were constructed of aluminium rather than steel, were an all in one design rather than a coach body on top of a separate underframe, and had sliding doors. Although the Class 445 and 446 were only prototype units, the information garnered from their use, both in initial testing and passenger service in the Southern Region, and later in departmental use as testbed units, led to the production of a new series of suburban EMUs that came into use in the mid to late 1970s. In 1975, SELNEC (by then renamed as the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive) published a new Picc-Vic publicity brochure that went into greater detail about the potential type of rolling stock that would be used, with an image of a Class 445 unit used to indicate the proposed type of train.Brook, Dodge p. 144-145 The front cover also had an artist's impression of a train resembling the new types then in development for the urban networks in London, Liverpool and Glasgow.Brook, Dodge p. 128 To fit with the TOPS classification of the other types powered via OHLE, the planned units for Manchester were assigned as Class 316. The Class 316 units were intended to replace a mix of different types; the unelectrified Buxton line (which would have had services as far as ) was predominantly operated by DMUs. Other services from Piccadilly were primarily operated by EMUs, while units operated over the uniquely electrified Bury line from Victoria. =Cancellation= Although specifications for the Class 316 units were prepared by the British Rail Research Division at Derby, no concrete tender proposals were issued to prospective manufacturers before the final cancellation of the Picc-Vic project in 1977. =Subsequent cross-city connection= Following the cancellation of the Picc-Vic project, the GMPTE came up with an alternative proposal for a street based light rail network, which would take over the Bury line (as envisaged in the Picc-Vic plan), and the line from Manchester Piccadilly to Altrincham, which would be joined by an on-street tram route. This eventually became Phase 1 of the Manchester Metrolink, which utilized a new-build fleet of 26 AnsaldoBreda T-68 light rail vehicles. This fleet, which eventually numbered 32, was replaced at the end of 2014 by the Bombardier M5000 type.

According to Sportradar, a company that monitors the integrity of sports events on behalf of sports federations, as many as 1% of the matches they monitor are likely to be fixed. Betting related match fixing scandals While British football has never been rocked by match fixing allegations on the scale of the Black Sox scandal (the aforementioned incidents involved league matches, not major championships), football match-fixing has become a serious problem in parts of Continental Europe. Cricket has been scandalized by several gambling and match fixing allegations in recent years, particularly the case of Hansie Cronje in the late 1990s, culminating in the World Cup investigations of 2007. These highly publicised enquiries were prompted by the surprise defeat of Pakistan in the Cup by Ireland and the subsequent murder investigation into the sudden death, straight after the match, of Pakistan's head coach Bob Woolmer. According to the head of the ICC's anti-corruption unit Paul Condon, cricket is the most bet on sport in the world, and fixing is found at every level of the sport and is a significant problem.Interview with Paul Condon by Charles Colville, Sky Sports June 4, 2010. The 2008 novel Raffles and the Match-Fixing Syndicate, by Adam Corres, places E. W. Hornung's A. J. Raffles, 'the gentleman thief', into the world of cricket match-fixing. This black humour comedy includes speculation on the infamous Hansie Cronje and Bob Woolmer incidents and features serious aspects of cricket gamesmanship or 'how to defeat a superior opponent without actually cheating', a vital skill in the cricketing psychology of 'thinking the batsman out'. The high salaries of some of today's professional athletes likely serves to insulate their leagues from player-instigated match fixing. In the NCAA and in leagues where the salaries are comparatively less (or, in the case of the amateur NCAA, zero), match fixing by players remains a serious concern. Preventing match fixing related to gambling=Ban on sports betting= Influenced by baseball's experiences, the NFL and NBA have followed MLB's lead and adopted a hard line against gambling on its games, especially by those directly involved in the league. The NCAA takes an even harder line: * It prohibits athletes, coaches, other athletic program staff, and non-athletic administrators with oversight over athletics programs at member schools, plus staff of member conferences, from gambling on any sport in which the NCAA holds a championship or any sport classified by the NCAA as an \\"emerging sport\\" for women. The prohibition includes professional competition in all of the aforementioned sports, and also specifically includes Division I FBS football, in which the NCAA does not sponsor an official championship. See especially Bylaw 10.3.1, Scope of Application (p. 46). * It also prohibits venues in championship play from carrying advertising for any form of gambling, including state lotteries. See specifically Bylaw 31.1.14.1, Restricted Advertising and Sponsorship Activities ‚Äì Advertising (p. 391). The betting policy of the World Baseball Softball Confederation, which governs international competition in both baseball and softball, was apparently influenced by that of Major League Baseball. Players, team staff, match officials, employees of national federations, and executives of organizing committees of WBSC-sanctioned events are prohibited from betting on any event within their specific sport, whether or not it is sanctioned by WBSC. For example, individuals associated with international baseball cannot bet on Major League Baseball games, though those associated only with softball can bet on MLB games. In addition, when baseball and/or softball is part of a multisport event, individuals involved with the participants in the baseball/softball events cannot bet on any other event taking place at that specific multisport event. Each of these organizations was, and may still be influenced by fears that their games could come under the influence of gamblers in the absence of these tough measures. Critics of such hard line measures note that in spite of such policies, such influence nonetheless does occur. When international motorcycle racing (MotoGP and World Superbike) race in the United States, the online gambling sites that advertise are prohibited from having their advertising on the motorcycles, owing to the similar hard line against gambling enforced by the majority of sports federations in the country. AMA Pro Racing (the ASN for the FIM in the United States) regulations prohibit gambling advertising and prohibit participants from betting on races. =National regulation on sports betting= In Britain the authorities in both government and sport have taken a softer line on gambling. Following decades of relatively lax, intermittent and ineffective enforcement of laws prohibiting gambling, sports betting was finally legalized and regulated in the 1960s. Organizations such as The Football Association long seemed to have taken the stance that gambling on their events was inevitable. For many years, the FA only prohibited betting on a match by those directly involved in the game in question. Footballers (or coaches, managers, etc.) were not prohibited from betting on matches that did not involve their own team. The FA has since adopted a much harder line on betting within the sport. Current rules ban all players, managers, and club personnel associated with any club in the top eight levels of the English men's league system, or in the top two levels of the women's league system, from betting on any football match anywhere in the world. This ban also applies to match officials, plus coaches and assessors thereof, who operate at Level 3 or above within the FA's referee classification system. As for individuals at lower levels of the football system, they are banned from betting on any match in the league in which they participate, as well as matches in which they are directly involved. Match fixing in football remains a major concern. In Turkey in 2011 more than 30 players and staff have been convicted of game fixing. In South Korea, more than 50 professional soccer players have been indicted and ten players have received lifetime bans. In Finland, two Zambian players were convicted and more than a dozen people are under investigation. Other investigations are continuing in China, El Salvador, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Thailand, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. In the United States and Canada, Major League Soccer and the Professional Referee Organization have a \\"Match Manipulation and Gambling Policy Statement\\" poster similar to Major League Baseball's Rule 21 posted in the locker rooms banning any betting on any match that features the MLS. The integrity of horse racing remains an ongoing concern since gambling is an integral part of this sport. Recent allegations of race fixing have centered around the recently formed betting exchanges which unlike traditional bookmakers allow punters to lay an outcome (that is, to bet against a particular runner). Most tracks prohibit jockeys from betting on races if they are riding during the day. Leading exchange Betfair has responded to the allegations by signing Memorandums of Understanding with the Jockey Club, The FA, the International Cricket Council, the Association of Tennis Professionals and other sporting authorities. These memoranda of understanding are evidence of the vast difference between British and American attitudes ‚Äî as of 2008 it would be almost unthinkable for an American sports league to sign such an agreement with a bookmaker or betting exchange. =Monitoring betting markets= By monitoring the pre-match betting markets it is possible to detect planned match fixing. It is also possible to detect on-going match manipulation by looking at the in-game betting markets. Several federations have employed services that provide such systems for detecting match manipulation. In addition, several federations run integrity tours where players and officials participate in educational workshops on how match fixing work and how they are prevented.

Family She grew up in Holly Springs, Mississippi, just after the American Civil War. Her father was lawyer, Harvey Washington Walter, who served in the Confederate Army as Judge Advocate under General Bragg; her mother, Martha Fredonia Brown, was descended from pioneers who had travelled west in 1788. When Anne Walter was thirteen, yellow fever hit the town of Holly Springs and her father sent his wife and youngest children away. He and three of his eldest sons remained behind and turned their mansion into a hospital to help look after the sick. In doing so they all contracted the fever and died within a week of each other. The death of Anne's father, and subsequent crop failures on their land, resulted in the Walter family facing serious financial difficulties despite the efforts of her surviving brother Harvey. Fortunately two of Anne's sisters married influential and wealthy men: Minnie married Henry Clay Myers, who was the Mississippi Secretary of State from 1879 to 1885, and Irene married Oscar Johnson of the International Shoe Company, who purchased Walter Place in 1889. Medical school At the age of twelve Anne was sent to Charlotte Female Institute, North Carolina, for three years. By the time she was sixteen she described herself as \\"only being qualified to be a social butterfly\\", but she was inspired to become a doctor of medicine. On hearing this her mother threatened to disown her but eventually relented and Anne entered the Cooper Medical College in San Francisco. She was then awarded a scholarship to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, from where she graduated in 1893. One of her colleagues at medical school, Dr. Margaret Polk, had been appointed to a missionary hospital in China, but due to family commitments could not go immediately, so Anne offered to take her place. At this time women who qualified as doctors were not always given the opportunity to practise, so this chance to work in China was welcomed by Anne. Soochow hospital Although she did not belong to a church, Anne became an employee of the Women's Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. She was based at Soochow (Suzhou) women's hospital, about 60 miles to the west of Shanghai. When Anne arrived in China, the journey between the two places took three days via the Suzhou Creek, later a rail link was constructed, reducing the journey time to a matter of hours. The women's hospital (also known as the Mary Black Hospital) had been opened in 1884 by Dr. Mildred Philips. She left in about 1892 and the hospital was temporarily closed until the arrival of Anne Walter. She soon became known for her energetic approach and during her time at the hospital (fourteen years) performed operations, delivered babies, opened additional wards and started a medical school for Chinese students. Marriage In 1896, she married a missionary physician, Dr. John Burrus Fearn, a native of Yazoo City, Mississippi. They had different views on religion, there was professional rivalry between them and Anne said that her husband was \\"dominant and born to give orders, just as definitely as I was born not to take them\\"; needless to say their marriage was described as \\"sometimes stormy\\". They had one child, a daughter Elizabeth, born in 1897 but who died of amoebic dysentery in 1902. In 1900 the couple took a furlough and returned to the U.S. The journey was delayed due to enforced periods of quarantine after the death of a passenger from yellow fever. Their absence from China coincided with the Boxer Rebellion and when they returned to Suzhou they found conditions had changed. There had been many executions, soldiers were billeted in the hospital chapel and it was months before normality returned. In 1905 anti-American sentiments in China resulted in further civil unrest, and for a period the Fearn family moved to Shanghai. Once the situation calmed down, they returned to Suzhou where they made plans for a world tour followed by a permanent move back to America. 1907 to 1914 In 1907, Dr. John Fearn resigned his position and the couple moved to the United States but returned to Shanghai the following year where he became a business manager for the Associated Protestant Missions. Inactivity did not suit Anne so she helped out in various missions and clinics; these included Miss Cornelia Bonnel's shelter for girls who had been forced into slavery or prostitution, and the Margaret Williamson Hospital for Chinese women and children. In February 1909, Francis Augustus Carl, of the Chinese Maritime Customs invited her to attend the International Opium Conference in Shanghai. She hosted a reception for the delegates, and this became the first of many such social events that she organised during her time in China. She was invited to join the American Women's Club in Shanghai, being elected as the corresponding secretary. Still frustrated at the lack of a purpose in her life she became involved with community work; this included opening facilities for visiting US sailors and efforts to improve the conditions for Chinese workers. She applied to work in Manchuria during a plague epidemic, but another doctor who had the necessary inoculations, was selected to go instead. So in 1910 she travelled to Japan and for a period worked as an obstetrician. Upon her return to Shanghai she became a physician in the Foreign Women's Rescue Home and continued to work at the Margaret Williamson Hospital. During the revolutionary period of 1913, the Fearn's worked with refugees in the city whilst stray bullets and shells landed around them from the fighting at the Kiangnan Arsenal. Sanatorium In 1914, the Fearn's started another trip, this time across China to Russia, arriving in Moscow just as the First World War began. They travelled to London and offered their medical services for the war effort, but were told they should go to the USA and register there. When they tried this they were informed that only male surgeons were required. They both returned to Shanghai where Anne started a private medical practise in partnership with Dr Polk. Her husband left for France where he became a temporary honorary Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, working with the Chinese Labour Corps. She rented a large house in the Shanghai French Concession and turned it into a private hospital called the Fearn Sanitorium; she managed to buy the property with funding from a wealthy Chinese man and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. She ran the hospital for ten years until the death of her husband on June 7, 1926. Since his return from the war, he had been the medical superintendent and director of the Shanghai General Hospital and later superintended the new Country Hospital. Eugen Steinach After the sale of the sanatorium Anne left Shanghai and travelled to the USA; she followed the route of an earlier trip she had taken with her husband. By the time she reached Vienna she was exhausted; an acquaintance informed her of the work of Eugen Steinach and his claims of being able to restore vitality and energy. Anne contacted Steinach, who was based in Vienna, and arranged to take the 30-day course of treatment. This started with tests followed by electrical treatment to improve circulation, injections of glandular extracts and occasional x-rays. On the eighth day she had become so weak she could hardly dress herself, but remarkable after this she began to feel invigorated. The effects lasted for two years and she then booked herself in for another treatment. Indefatigable social worker Anne could not settle in America and yet again returned to Shanghai where she was involved with charitable fund raising activities, hosting gatherings with financiers, politicians, and artists. She travelled abroad, giving talks and meeting influential figures to gain support for organisations such as the National Child Welfare Association of China and the Shanghai American School. She was in Manila in 1932 when a military conflict took place in Shanghai between Japanese and Chinese forces (referred to as the Shanghai Incident or January 28 Incident ). This placed more pressure on the voluntary services that Anne worked for, supporting refugees, the homeless and orphans. Her memoirs and death Anne returned home in 1938, where she completed her memoirs My Days of Strength just before her death in Berkeley, California on April 28, 1939, aged 71. She dedicated the book to Irene \\"my sister and friend\\". Her remains were cremated and returned to Shanghai for interment.

Built 1876-86 as a gift to the town by Henry Pennell, it housed the town high school for many years, and now houses municipal offices. A fine example of institutional high style Italianate architecture, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Pennell Institute building is located in Gray's village center, on the south side of Main Street (US Route 202). It is a 2-1/2 story brick building with a gable roof and tower. A tall 2-1/2 story gabled section projects from the front, with single-story porches on either side, sheltering the original entrances. The front of the projection has corner pilasters, round-arch recessed panels, narrow round-arch windows, a wider round-arch window at the gable, and decorative brickwork at the cornice. The tower above features a clock, set in a round-arch panel, topped by a flared cornice, belfry, and a crested and flared truncated pyramidal roof. The building's sides are five bays long, defined by round-arch recessed panels two stories in height. Windows here, as on the front, have bracketed stone hoods and sills. A modern ell extends to the rear, with wings out to its sides. Set south of the main building is the former laboratory building, built later but stylistically sympathetic to the original. The town of Gray has offered high school education since the early 19th century, but it was poorly organized for many years. By 1870 the need for a proper high school, with a permanent full-time staff was evident. Henry Pennell, then the town's wealthiest resident, promised to build the town a high school. Work was begun on this building was begun in 1876, but construction languished, and it was still incomplete in 1884, when Pennell died. In his will, he bequeathed additional funds to complete the building, including an endowment for maintenance and bequests for the library and laboratory. The building was finally completed in 1886, and graduated its first class three years later. The building now houses municipal offices.

George Washington Storter Jr. (July 1, 1862 - October 26, 1931) was a trader and founder of Everglades City. His grandfather George Sr. migrated in a covered wagon to Platt, Florida, from Eutaw, Alabama in 1877, making his first trip to the Everglades in September 1881 to farm with one William S. Allen. George Jr. purchased large tracts of land further south along Chokoloskee Bay and founded the town of Everglade, later to become Everglades City, in 1893. From there the family shipped buttonwood, cane syrup, and grapefruits to Tampa. They also operated a trading post where Seminoles came to barter or sell deer hides and alligator skins. George Storter Jr. became famous for the sugar cane he grew. His main competition came from Ted Smallwood of the Ted Smallwood Store. Settlements start in Chokoloskee Bay of Collier County, Florida, along the Barron River. The American Civil War saw many Union refugees flee the Confederate state of Florida for Key West, still a member of the Union. As population increased, officials at Key West gave some of them tools, seeds and supplies for purposes of gardening at Cape Sable and on some of the Keys. John Weeks was one of these, and the first to settle on the Barron River c. 1861. William Smith Allen, who gave the Barron River its name until 1923, was the first permanent white settler of Everglade. Originally from Connecticut, he eventually moved to Jacksonville, and with the outbreak of war he, with other Unionists, went to Key West. Allen first visited Weeks in 1868 and was impressed by the soil. He then returned, owning all of the present-day Everglade township along the river from 1873 to 1889. \\"But the real founder of Everglades and its most influential citizen for over a quarter of a century was George W. Storter Jr.\\" A site called Port DuPont along the Barron river was settled by African- American August Swycover and his wife. They planted sugar cane along the west bank of the river. Swycover shipped the sugar to Key West, used in those days for chewing. By 1883, George Sr. established himself opposite the Port DuPont site. By 1887, George W. Storter Jr. and Nancy arrived; and on January 1, 1889, the first white child was born in the Everglade. A miss Frances Eva Storter, Neal's older sister. After Allen's death, George W. Storter Jr. purchased all the Allen property for $800. In 1895 he secured the first post office first called Everglade with him as postmaster.

Synopsis  Maggie is a suicidal young woman who has traveled to a lonely beach with the intent to commit suicide. She's astonished when she is visited by both Judas Iscariot and Pontius Pilate. Both men have their own reasons for appearing - Judas because Saint Peter promised him entrance to Heaven. Pilate was sent as well, but was given no similar promise of redemption. As the night progresses the trio is visited by Joan, who washes up on the beach.  Reception  The Houston Press was mixed in their opinion, writing \\"Impressively smart and funny in places, the play feels over-boiled and unnecessarily populated with ideas in others\\" but also stating that it was \\"impressive for such a novice playwright\\". The Houston Chronicle was also mixed, stating \\"Stages deserves credit for taking the risk of a world premiere, and \\"The Book of Maggie\\" is not without its pluses and some potentially interesting ground to cover.

The reason for fixing a match includes ensuring a certain team advances or gambling. Match fixing is seen as one of the biggest problems in organized sports. This page is a list of match fixing incidents and of matches that are widely suspected of having been fixed. American football *The Canton Bulldogs‚ÄìMassillon Tigers betting scandal, which is recognized as the first major scandal in professional football history, unfolded after the 1906 Ohio League championship series. Canton Bulldogs coach Blondy Wallace and Massillon Tigers end Walter East were accused of conspiring to fix the series. *In 1915, an unidentified gambler made an offer of $150 to Multnomah Athletic Club football player L. W. \\"Patsy\\" O'Rourke to throw the team's annual Thanksgiving game against the University of Oregon football team. O'Rourke approached team captain Red Rupert about the bribe, and the information ultimately made its way to Multnomah's coach. As a result, O'Rourke was benched for the game, which was a 15‚Äì2 victory for Oregon. *An attempt was made to fix the 1946 NFL Championship Game between the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears, in favor of the latter team. Alvin J. Paris was convicted of bribery in 1947 for soliciting Giants players Frank Filchock and Merle Hapes. Harvey Stemmer and David \\"Pete\\" Karkower were also convicted of bribery for their involvement in the plot. The convictions were upheld on appeal in 1948. *In 1949, Daniel Opalka of Massena, New York was arrested for allegedly offering Massena High School football player David Walker $200 to fix the team's upcoming game against Saranac Lake High School. Opalka admitted to having a conversation with Walker about fixing the game, but said he was doing so in jest. *In 1960, Brooklyn, New York school teacher David Budin was arrested by Michigan State Police for allegedly trying to bribe University of Oregon football team member Mickey Bruce in order to fix the outcome of their upcoming game against the University of Michigan football team. According to police, University of Oregon athletic director Leo Harris declined to press charges to spare Bruce from having to be involved further. Budin was released by police after paying a $150 fine because he registered his hotel room under false name. Bruce later alleged sports gambler Frank Rosenthal was the mastermind of the plot. *In 1998, four Northwestern University football players were indicted for lying to a federal grand jury when they testified they had not placed wagers on their own games in 1994. Only one player‚Äîtailback Dennis Lundy‚Äîwas accused of fixing the game. Lundy denied in front of the grand jury to intentionally fumbling on a play during a game against the University of Iowa in 1994. Federal prosecutors attested the fumble was intentional for the purposes of point-shaving. * 2009: On May 6, a federal grand jury in Detroit indicted six former University of Toledo athletes‚Äîthree each from the school's football and basketball programs‚Äîon charges of conspiracy to commit sports bribery in relation to their alleged involvement in a point shaving scheme that ran from 2003 through 2006. It is believed to be the first major U.S. gambling case involving two sports at the same college. Since then, four former Toledo athletes, including at least one not named in the original indictments, have pleaded guilty on charges related to the scheme. One of these, former Rockets running back Quinton Broussard, admitted he had deliberately fumbled during the 2005 GMAC Bowl against UTEP (a game ultimately won 45‚Äì13 by Toledo) in exchange for $500, and had been paid to provide confidential team information to one of the orchestrators of the scheme. Association football *In 1964, the great British football betting scandal of the 1960s was uncovered: a betting ring organized by Jimmy Gauld and involving several Football League players had been fixing matches. The most famous incident involved three Sheffield Wednesday players, including two England international players, who were subsequently banned from football for life and imprisoned after it was discovered they had bet on their team losing a match against Ipswich Town. A similar scandal had occurred in 1915. *1980 Italian football scandal (\\"Totonero\\"): In May 1980, the largest match fixing scandal in the history of Italian football was uncovered by Italian Guardia di Finanza, after the spalling of two Roman shopkeepers, Alvaro Trinca and Massimo Cruciani, who declared that some Italian football players sold the football-matches for money, implicating, among others, AC Milan and Lazio. Teams were suspected of rigging games by selecting favorable referees, with superstar Italian World Cup team goalkeeper Enrico Albertosi and future 1982 FIFA World Cup winner Paolo Rossi being banned for betting on football games. Both clubs were forcibly relegated to Serie B and the ringleader of the scheme, Milan president Felice Colombo, received a life ban.Italian FA under emergency rule, BBC Sport, 16 May 2006. *In 1981, a mob of about 500 people took over the pitch during a Panionios F.C. practice amid accusations that team trainer Lakis Petropoulos helped fix a match against P.A.S. Korinthos that resulted in a 0‚Äì0 draw. Police assisted Petropoulos to safety. *During the 1982 FIFA World Cup, West Germany and Austria played a game on 25 June known as the Disgrace of Gij√≥n due to accusations that both teams had fixed the match. *In 1986, the Yugoslavian Football Association ruled that the first round playoffs of the Yugoslav First League had to be replayed after accusations of match fixing were made against several teams by the press. Twelve of the league's 18 teams were penalized. A court later dismissed the penalties against the clubs. * In February 1999 a Malaysian-based betting syndicate was caught attempting to install a remote-control device to sabotage the floodlights at FA Premier League team Charlton Athletic's ground, with the aid of a corrupt security officer. If the match had been abandoned after half- time, then the result and bets would have stood. Subsequent investigations showed that the gang had been responsible for previously unsuspected \\"floodlight failures\\" at West Ham's ground in November 1997, and again a month later at Crystal Palace's ground during a home match of Palace's groundsharing tenant Wimbledon. *The Italian Football Federation said in October 2000 it had found eight players guilty of match-fixing. Three were from Serie A side Atalanta and the other five played for Serie B side Pistoiese. The players were Giacomo Banchelli, Cristiano Doni and Sebastiano Siviglia (all Atalanta) and Alfredo Aglietti, Massimiliano Allegri, Daniele Amerini, Gianluca Lillo and Girolamo Bizzarri (all Pistoiese). The charges related to an Italian Cup first round tie between the two sides in Bergamo on August 20, 2000 which ended 1‚Äì1. Atalanta scored at the end of the first half and Pistoiese equalised three minutes from full-time. Atalanta qualified for the second round. Snai, which organises betting on Italian football, said later it had registered suspiciously heavy betting on the result and many of the bets were for a 1‚Äì0 halftime score and a full-time score of 1‚Äì1. *In 2004, Portuguese Police launched the operation Apito Dourado and named several Portuguese club presidents and football personalities as suspects of match fixing, including FC Porto's chairman Pinto da Costa. Some of the wiretaps used as proof, deemed inadmissible in court, can now be found on YouTube. * In June 2004 in South Africa, thirty-three people (including nineteen referees, club officials, a match commissioner and an official of the South African Football Association) were arrested on match-fixing charges. * 2005 German football match-fixing scandal: In January 2005, the German Football Association (DFB) and German prosecutors launched separate probes into charges that referee Robert Hoyzer bet on and fixed several matches that he worked, including a German Cup tie. Hoyzer later admitted to the allegations; it has been reported that he was involved with Croat gambling syndicates, and also implicated other referees and players in the match fixing scheme. The first arrests in the Hoyzer investigation were made on January 28 in Berlin, and Hoyzer himself was arrested on February 12 after new evidence apparently emerged to suggest that he had been involved in fixing more matches than he had admitted to. Hoyzer has been banned for life from football by the DFB. On March 10, a second referee, Dominik Marks, was arrested after being implicated in the scheme by Hoyzer. Still later (March 24), it was reported that Hoyzer had told investigators that the gambling ring he was involved with had access to UEFA's referee assignments for international matches and Champions League and UEFA Cup fixtures several days before UEFA publicly announced them. Ultimately, Hoyzer was sentenced to serve 2 years and 5 months in prison. * In July 2005, Italian Serie B champions Genoa was downgraded to last place in the division by the sporting justice, and therefore condemned to relegation in Serie C1, after it was revealed that they bribed their opponents in the final match of the season, Venezia to throw the match. Club president Enrico Preziozi was banned for five years after being guilty by the sporting justice. Genoa won the match 3‚Äì2 and had apparently secured promotion to Serie A. *Brazilian football match-fixing scandal: In September 2005, a Brazilian magazine revealed that two football referees, Ed√≠lson Pereira de Carvalho (a member of FIFA's referee staff) and Paulo Jos√© Danelon, had accepted bribes to fix matches. Soon afterwards, sport authorities ordered the replaying of 11 matches in the country's top competition, the Campeonato Brasileiro, that had been worked by Ed√≠lson. Both referees have been banned for life from football and face criminal charges. Brazilian supporters have taken to shout \\"Ed√≠lson\\" at a referee who they consider to have made a bad call against their team, in a reference to the scandal. *2008 The Fix: Book by Declan Hill alleges that in the 2006 World Cup, the group game between Ghana and Italy, the round-of-16 game between Ghana and Brazil, and the Italy-Ukraine quarter-final were all fixed by Asian gambling syndicates to whom the final scores were known in advance. The German Football Federation (DFB) and German Football League (DFL) looked into claims made in a Der Spiegel interview with Hill that two Bundesliga matches were fixed by William Bee Wah Lim a fugitive with a 2004 conviction for match-fixing. *2008: On October 1, it was reported that a Spanish judge who headed an investigation against Russian Mafia figures uncovered information alleging that the mobsters may have attempted to fix the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Cup semi-final between eventual champion Zenit St. Petersburg and Bayern Munich. Both clubs denied any knowledge of the alleged scheme. Prosecutors in the German state of Bavaria, home to Bayern, later announced that they did not have enough evidence to justify a full investigation. *2008: On October 4, suspicious online betting on the game between Norwich City and Derby County led some to question the validity of the Football League match. Gamblers in Asia were said to have placed a large amount of money down during halftime, which raised concerns over the outcome.FA launches match-fixing investigation into Norwich v Derby match, 16 October 2008, accessed 14 Match 2009 The inquiry by The Football Association found no evidence that would suggest the match was fixed.Match-fixing inquiry closed by FA, 5 December 2008, accessed 14 March 2009. Derby County ended up winning the match 2‚Äì1. * In November 2009, German police arrested 17 people on suspicion of fixing at least 200 soccer matches in 9 countries. Among the suspected games were those from the top leagues of Austria, Bosnia, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Turkey, and games from the second highest leagues of Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland. Three contests from the Champions League were also under investigation, and 12 from the Europa League. *In June 2011, trials started for people allegedly involved in fixing Finnish football matches. One team, Tampere United was indefinitely suspended from Finnish football for accepting payments from a person known for match-fixing. * In July 2011, as part of a major match-fixing investigation by authorities in Turkey, nearly 60 people suspected to be involved with fixing games were detained by ƒ∞stanbul Police Department Organized Crime Control Bureau and then arrested by the court. The case did not come to a conclusion yet and the teams that are being accused of match-fixing are participating in the Turkish league currently. *The Match fixing investigations of Norwegian Second Division saw Norway and Sweden arresting individuals in 2012, including players of Follo FK and Asker Fotball. * Operation VETO, a Europol investigation announced in 2013 that identified 380 fixed association football matches in 15 countries. * The 2013 Lebanese match-fixing scandal involved 24 players, with two (Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud El Ali) being banned from the sport for life. * In December 2013, six people in Britain, including Blackburn forward DJ Campbell, were arrested for allegedly fixing football games. The arrests were made by the National Crime Agency after release of a report from FederBet, a Brussels-based gambling watchdog, an organization created by the online bookmakers to watch the flow of bets across Europe. *In 2016, Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) president Phillip Chiyangwa gave a news conference where he accused the Zimbabwe national football team of fixing matches during the African Nations Championship in January. ZIFA executive committee member Edzai Kasinauyo was suspended for allegedly helping fix an upcoming match against Swaziland. Callisto Pasuwa, who was the head coach of Zimbabwe national team, was one of the whistleblowers. Australian football *In 1910, several members of the Carlton Football Club in the Victorian Football League were implicated in a match-fixing scandal. Alex Lang and Doug Fraser were suspended for 99 matches for their part in the scheme. Doug Gillespie was briefly dropped by Carlton, but re-joined the club before the Grand Final when the league report on the scandal exonerated him. *In 2009, allegations arose that the Melbourne Football Club had purposely lost matches to get a better pick in the upcoming Australian Football League draft‚Äîwhich in sports is known as 'tanking'. An investigation by the AFL exonerated Melbourne after finding no evidence they tanked. Badminton *In 1985, English badminton player Steve Baddeley told The Times, \\"There is no doubt at all that the Chinese sometimes fix matches\\". Denmark badminton player Kirsten Larsen accused Chinese players Li Lingwei and Han Aiping of fixing their finals match during that year's Chinese National Badminton Championships. *In 2008, Chinese badminton coach Li Yongbo admitted to fixing a match during the 2004 Summer Olympics. As a response, the Badminton World Federation created an integrity panel to investigate alleged match fixing incidents in badminton. *During the 2012 Summer Olympics, several of the Badminton women's doubles matches came under scrutiny from Olympic officials and the Badminton World Federation (BWF). Eight players were ejected from games for failing to used their ‚Äúbest efforts‚Äù to win their matches. There was no evidence that the games were thrown for gambling purposes; instead the teams deliberately under-performed in round-robin tournament stage matches to get a favorable seeding in the knockout tournament stage. See Badminton at the 2012 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Women's doubles for details. *During the 2014 Japan Open, Danish Badminton Athletes Commission president Hans- Kristian Vittinghus was asked via Facebook by a man he met from prior tournaments if he would be interested in fixing matches. Vittinghus declined and later found out the same person approached Danish player Kim Astrup with the same offer. The two went to the Badminton World Federation (BWF) who then requested they re-engage the person in order to find out their identity. *In 2018, the Badminton World Federation (BWF) issued suspensions of 15 and 20 years for Malaysian players Tan Chun Seang and Zulfadli Zulkiffli, respectively, for fixing matches during various 2013 tournaments. The BWF convinced an independent panel to investigate allegations made by an unnamed whistleblower. The investigation found that Zulkiffli had fixed at least four matches which accounted for 31 infractions under BWF rules. Baseball *A game in September 1865 which resulted in a 23‚Äì11 victory for the Eckford of Brooklyn over the New York Mutuals was fixed according to confessions by those involved. Mutuals catcher Bill Wansley was approached by gambler Kane McLoughlin to throw the game for $100. Wansley enlisted the help of the Mutuals third baseman Ed Duffy who agreed to participate if they included shortstop Tom Devyr. Wansley took the two players by wagon to the Hoboken Ferry where the payment was divided. Duffy and Devyr both received $30 each and Wansley kept $40 for himself. The fielding of those in on the fix‚Äîparticularly Wansley's performance‚Äîwas so poor that rumors of a fix began almost instantly. Wansley had so many passed balls during the game that he was moved to right field in the seventh inning. Henry Chadwick wrote about the game for the New York Clipper and defended Wansley against the fixing allegations. Mutuals players who were not in on the fix became suspicious of Wansley and accused him of \\"wilful and designated inattention\\". After a formal investigation, Wansley admitted to the fix and the three players were banned from organized baseball. Devyr was allowed to return in 1867 for a short time before two complaints from opposing teams were filed against the Mutuals. In December 1867 the baseball's National Commission voted to reinstate Devyr. Duffy returned to the Mutuals in 1868, but was not reinstated by the National Commission, which led to one of the Mutuals opponents to file a complaint to void the games Duffy appeared in. The complaint was successful and the Mutuals were briefly expelled from organized baseball. The final convention of the amateur baseball National Commission was held on November 30, 1870. At the convention, Mutuals president John Wildly motioned to reinstate Wansley to good standing which was approved. *On July 24, 1873 umpire Bob Ferguson declared a game between Baltimore Canaries and the New York Mutuals fixed by gamblers. Ferguson went into the stands to confront the gamblers following the game and then went back down to the field to confront players he believed were in on the fix. Two of the Mutuals players‚ÄîJohn Hatfield and Nat Hicks‚Äîbegan accusing each other of being in on the fix. Hicks eventually grabbed a baseball bat and struck Ferguson in the arm which caused it to break. Ferguson, who was also a player as well as an umpire, was unable to play for one year because of the injury. No actions were taken against Hicks or any other player.Ginsburg, pp. 20‚Äì21 *In 1875, the St. Paul Red Caps and the Winona Clippers split a two-game championship series. Rumors gained steam after the series that two Clippers players‚ÄîFrank Smith and W. W. Fisher‚Äîhad worked with gamblers to fix the games. Fisher signed a confession that he accepted $250 from an unidentified gambler. *In 1877, four players for the Louisville Grays were banned from organized baseball for throwing games. Louisville Courier-Journal sports writer John Haldeman, whose father Waltesr Haldeman owned the team, became suspicious of the play of the four members of the Grays and began writing in his columns that he believed the players were purposefully losing. His columns led to a formal investigation and four players‚ÄîJim Devlin, George Hall, Al Nichols and Bill Craver‚Äîwere banned from organized professional baseball for life. Carver's involvement in the plot is debated by baseball historians including Bob Bailey for the Society of American Baseball Research. *In 1882, due to his associations with gamblers, National League umpire Dick Higham was banned from organized baseball for life. The information was uncovered by private investigators hired by owners of the Detroit Wolverines, who suspected Higham of fixing games. *In 1908, National League umpires Jim Johnstone and Bill Klem reported to the league office that they were approached before a make-up game between the Chicago Cubs and the New York Giants and offered money to fix the game. The make-up game was on account of a baserunning mistake by Fred Merkle known as \\"Merkle's Boner\\". *An American League game on September 25, 1919 between the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians was fixed according to letters ascertained by league president Ban Johnson in 1926. The letters were between Detroit outfielder Ty Cobb and Cleveland outfielder Smokey Joe Wood. They were sold to Johnson by pitcher Dutch Leonard who was one of the four players in on the fix along with Cobb, Wood and Cleveland player-manager Tris Speaker. According to Leonard, Cobb suggested the players place bets on the game which they had already agreed to fix. Cobb denied placing any bets, but did confess to being involved in the fix. According to a retrospective of events by the Chicago Tribune in 1989, Leonard went to Johnson with the letters in 1926 after he became embittered at Cobb and Wood whom he felt had a hand in ending his career early. Johnson initially turned Leonard away and he went to Detroit owner Frank Navin with the letters. Navin advised Johnson to make a payment to Leonard to keep the letters from going public. Johnson then agreed to pay Leonard $20,000 for the letters. Following the 1926 season, Johnson called a secret meeting with Cobb and Speaker, who were the managers of their respective teams. Johnson laid out the facts and advised the men to resign their positions as managers, which both did. Cobb and Speaker both retired from playing in 1928 and neither took another managerial job. The Associated Press broke the story on December 21, 1926. *In 1919, gamblers bribed several members of the Chicago White Sox to throw the World Series. This became known as the Black Sox Scandal and was recounted in book and movie form as Eight Men Out. *Following the 1919 Pacific Coast League (PCL) season, first baseman Babe Borton alleged that as a member of the pennant winning Vernon Tigers, he was party to pay-offs to all other PCL teams to ensure they would lose to Vernon. Borton alleged that every member of the Tigers pooled their money to make the pay-offs. Nate Raymond of Seattle, Washington was responsible for the payments according to Borton. Seattle Indians first baseman Rod Murphy alleged that Raymond offered him a $2,000 bribe during the 1920 season and confided that during the 1919 season he won $50,000 from gambling on fixed PCL games. Ultimately no player was charged with fixing games because there were no state statutes that were violated. The PCL banned several players for life, but some like Bill Rumler was reinstated after several years. *On September 27, 1924, before a game between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Phillies, Giants backup outfielder Jimmy O'Connell approached Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand with a $500 bribe for to throw the game. If the Giants beat the Phillies it would have clinched them the National League pennant and a trip to the World Series. Sand rejected the offer and reported the incident which made its way up to the Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis. O'Connell confessed that he did attempt to bribe Sand, but contended Giants coach Cozy Dolan had put him up to it. Landis suspended O'Connell and Dolan from organized baseball for life. *On June 5, 1947, National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues president George Trautman banned Western Association outfielder Marion McElreath for attempting to bribe an opposing player to fix a game on May 4. 1947. *In 1947, a report by National Commission president William G. Bramham found that five players in the Evangeline League, a minor league based in Louisiana, fixed several playoff games in 1946 for gambling purposes. For their role in the alleged plot, the five players‚ÄîBill Thomas, Lanny Pecou, Alvin W. Kaiser, Paul Fugit and Don Vettorel‚Äîwere banned from professional baseball for life. An investigation of the alleged actions of the five players by Society for American Baseball Research writer George W. Hilton found little proof that there was any match-fixing. One of the accused players, Bill Thomas, pitched a perfect 5‚Äì0 record in the playoffs. Hilton conducted an interview with an unnamed player in the Evangeline League who claimed he was approached to be a part of the fixing scheme, but declined.

After an investigation, it was found that Barr had no contact with Locke relating to fixing games. Instead, Barr felt slighted by Locke‚Äîwhom he knew from youth baseball‚Äîand created an elaborate story to damage his reputation. The Center for Investigative Reporting and Sports Illustrated released the details of the events on August 18, 2014 which included reporting on the aggressive tactics of the MLB investigators led by retired New York Police Department officer Rick Burnham. Locke recalled that the MLB investigators told him that they had proof that he was in on fixing games and pressured him to confess, in spite of his pleas of innocence and the fact the investigators presented no proof. *In 2016, South Korean police released information about an alleged match-fixing scheme in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) dating back to 2014 that involved 21 people‚Äîthree of whom played in the KBO.

According to the allegations published in The Korea Times, the other South Korean teams competing in the tournament colluded to make sure Project X beat out the foreign teams. The Times alleged this was possible because of the tournament's rules that added the team's points up to determine the winner instead of a traditional elimination tournament. The opposing South Korean teams let Project X run up the score during their contests to game the overall outcome of the tournament, according to the Times. Red Bull Korea denied having any part in the alleged scheme.

The case has been promptly used by Russian officials and media to accuse Germany of tolerating and covering up child abuse which in turn provoked demonstrations of Russian Germans in several cities in Germany. The kidnapping story has been shortly after proven to be false by police after analysis of mobile phone logs and Lisa admitted she went into hiding voluntarily and wasn't raped.Alleged rape in Berlin: 13-year-old Russian German has invented kidnapping case, n-tv.de 2016-01-29  Incidents  On 11 January Lisa F.

Built in 1913 and enlarged several times, it is architecturally significant as an excellent example of Beaux-Arts architecture, and is historically important for its role in local education. The building, closed in 2004, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Bennington's high school educational services are now provided by Mount Anthony Union High School. Description and history The Old Bennington High School is located on the eastern edge of Bennington's downtown area, on the north side of Main Street (Vermont Route 9), on a lot that is bounded on the north side by Pleasant Street. It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of brick and stone, and set on a concrete foundation. The south-facing main facade is symmetrical, with a central section flanked by slightly projecting wings. The central portion houses the main entrance, which is sheltered by a two-story portico with fluted Corinthian columns supporting an entablature, a cornice, and parapet. It is flanked on the first floor by single sash windows with stone keystones, and on the second floor by bands of sash windows with transoms above. The front-facing wing ends have no windows, and a brick panel outline with marble corner blocks. Medallions are centered near the tops of these panels. The town of Bennington's first high school was built about 1875, and was over its capacity by 1909. In 1912 the town authorized construction of this building, which was formally opened in 1914. It served as a high school until 1967, undergoing additions in 1939, 1958, and again in 1975, when it was serving as Mount Anthony Middle School. The middle school was closed in 2004, and plans were laid to convert the building to senior housing.

The building was designed in 1939 by Gino Salvestrini and Gabriello Gabrielli di Quercita. Because of the outbreak of the Second World War, however, works started only in 1947 and were completed in 1951. The high- rise building, also called Torre Santa Teresa or Grattacielo Santa Teresa, is located at the corner between via Santa Teresa and via XX Settembre, in central Turin. It owes its name to the day that marks the capture of Rome (20 September 1870), an event that was much celebrated by the Fascist Regime, during which time the building was originally designed. Its volume is clearly visible from Piazza San Carlo and was conceived as a Modernist counterpoint to the Baroque square. The building is composed of a 14-floor vertical structure and a 5-floor horizontal structure. Both structures are entirely covered by white limestone tesserae, with the exception of the two lowest floors where green marble and metal walls can be seen. Its western fa√ßade borders the small square in front of the church of Santa Teresa. The dimensional proportion between the windows and the built mass reflects the architectural theories of Italian rationalism, while decoration of interior common spaces can be considered a late example of Art Deco style.

The set was designed by Isamu Noguchi; Graham created the costume. The work began as an ensemble piece, Perspectives: Frontier and Marching Song also known as Frontiers (Perspective No. 1) and Frontier. The ballet's Marching Song portion was set to music by Lehman Engle. The work premiered on April 28, 1935, at the Guild Theatre in New York City. By the end of 1935, Graham was performing Frontier exclusively as a solo. The piece was the first of her works to explore American identity through an archetypal character.  Theme  Approximately seven minutes in length, Frontier is the first of Graham's \\"American\\" modern dance works, a group that includes American Document (1938), American Provincials (1934), Panorama (1935), El Penitente (1940), Letter to the World (1940), Salem Shore (1943) and Appalachian Spring (1944). In its solo form, the piece was subtitled American Perspective of the Plains. In her autobiography, Blood Memory, Graham wrote that her family's move West by train was the inspiration for Frontier. \\"Tracks in front of me, how they gleamed whether we went straight ahead or through a newly carved-out mountain. It was these tracks that hugged the land, and became a part of my living memory. Parallel lines whose meaning was inexhaustible, whose purpose was infinite. This was, for me, the beginning of my ballet Frontier.\\" The work meshes with Graham's stated goal to create a \\"uniquely American\\" dance form, to help \\"bring forth an art as powerful as the country itself.\\"  Set and costume  Frontier was the first of Graham's ballets to feature scenic elements. All of her previous dances had been performed on a bare stage. She commissioned sculptor Isamu Noguchi to design the spare, but evocative, set. A rough log fence, two rails supported by two upright posts, sits at center stage. Two lengths of rope are arranged in a V-shape that stretches from either wing of the stage to meet in a point behind the fence, an effect suggesting limitless perspective. It was Noguchi's first effort at creating a stage set. He would continue to design for Graham's work over the next five decades. Graham herself designed the Frontier costume, a stylized version of a 19th century homespun dress. It consisted of a long pale pink gingham jumper with asymmetric collar over a simple, long-sleeved white blouse. The gown's color was selected to suggest optimism and freshness. An open short white loose- fitting jacket with dolman style sleeves completed the garment. Her hair was worn loose, but pulled back from her face with a strip of cloth. The overall effect of set and costume is one of a rugged pioneer woman joyously at home in \\"the vastness of the American landscape before it was fully tamed by the settlers.\\"  Score  Graham's mentor and musical director Louis Horst composed the ballet's score for a small ensemble: wind instruments, drum and piano. The music is essentially \\"a simple rendering of an American tune in rondo form.\\" Its rhythmic patterns shift unexpectedly to support relatively short sections of thematically-related movement, but are integrated smoothly into a unified composition.  Choreography  The choreography is direct and deceptively simple. The curtain opens to reveal the soloist standing and facing the audience, arms behind her grasping the fence rail. As the orchestra plays a fanfare, she rhythmically pulses up and down, and then steps side to side, lifting her free leg higher and higher. She places her left leg on the upper railing, continuing to rise and fall on the ball of her right foot. Turning her head as if to scan the horizon, she breaks into a broad smile. Frontier marked the first time Graham smiled as part of the choreography, shedding the emotionless expression worn in her previous dances. The soloist slowly leans back to recline across the fence as if to claim it and the surrounding territory as her own. As the music transitions into a march, she disengages from the fence with an expansive circular motion. The movement now becomes a parade step, as the soloist marches up and downstage exuberantly swinging one arm as she kicks sideways with the opposite leg. Three times, the dancer advances kicking to the side. The movement alternates twice with a lunging backward kick and release step outlining a circular pattern on the stage. The dancer returns to the fence, once more aligning her body horizontally, then sinks to the floor. Now on her knees, she leans back with rigid thighs and torso in a movement known as a \\"hinge\\". This resolves into a series of splits, a wide embrace of the air and return to a standing position. Another set of joyous sideways kick-jumps follows. At the sound of a sustained flute note and the musical hint of a solemn hymn, she straightens her body. Pressing her arms tightly to her sides, she performs a sequence of tiny steps with feet in parallel. Facing the audience, the dancer repeatedly traces a square pattern on the stage with the repetitive lateral movement. On one pass around the perimeter, she rocks an invisible infant in her arms. The ballet ends with the soloist's return to the fence, her back to the audience and face in profile.state She plants her leg triumphantly on the upper rail, one arm outstretched, one upraised, in salutation to all she surveys. In a final definitive gesture, she brings her fist down to clasp a knee.  Critical reception  After the premiere and subsequent performances, many reviewers were struck by the new warmth and accessibility of Graham's dancing. \\"Instead of static preoccupation with abstract considerations of form and medium...,\\" wrote a Massachusetts critic, \\"The center of her attention has shifted so that now the dancer may be thought of as looking outward into the world where history as the component of complex human factors is to be studied.\\" By \\"adding the dimension of action to the former dimensions of space and time,\\" the quality of her dancing has \\"become more emotional, warmer, less classic and detached from ordinary humanity.\\" The Dance Observer's Lois Balcom agreed. In 1944, she wrote, \\"To many, Frontier seemed to mark a new direction, a warmer, more intimate spirit, a more 'understandable' Martha Graham. For its lyricism, for its evocation of shimmering space, for the novelty of its decor and the haunting quality of its music, it was loved on the first night of its presentation and has been loved through countless repetitions ever since.\\" The New York Times' critic John Martin wrote of a later performance, \\"Frontier is deeply felt and simply projected... Here, one believes, Miss Graham has touched the finest note of her career...\\" The set and costume were also praised and appreciated as visual aids to understanding the work. \\"One wished that Miss Graham would see fit to use in her other dances of suggestive props such as those employed in Frontier, where they prove of inestimable value as stimulation to the observer's fantasy.\\" Frontier has been interpreted as a metaphor for the dancer/choreographer coming into her own as a mature and independent artist. In retrospect, some Graham scholars regard Frontier as a sketch for her best-known work Appalachian Spring since they are similar in theme and style.  Performance history  Frontier became Graham's most popular solo and a trademark, of sorts. In 1937, Graham was invited by Eleanor Roosevelt to perform at the White House, the first dancer to receive this honor. Frontier was among the four solos she presented. Graham performed the work with great frequency until the early 1940s, and then less so. In 1964, a film of Frontier with Ethel Winter was made at Connecticut College. The film was disavowed by Graham as inauthentic. Frontier briefly reentered the Martha Graham Dance Company repertory in 1975, performed by both Janet Eilber and Peggy Lyman. In 1976, Eilber was filmed dancing the solo role. The television series Great Performances: Dance in America featured the Graham and her troupe in the third episode of the first season. The troupe performed six Graham works: Frontier (Janet Eilber), Lamentation, Appalachian Spring, Diversion of Angels, Adorations and Cave of the Heart. In 1985, the work was revived, with Eilber as soloist, for the 50th anniversary of Graham's collaboration with Noguchi. Blakeley White-McGuire appeared as the pioneer woman in 2009 for a performance celebrating 75 years of dance programming at the 92nd Street Y.

The film was produced by Raymond Spottiswoode and directed by Ernest Borneman,Lerner 1987, p. 75. from a story by Leslie McFarlane, based on the industrial production of the Avro Lancaster in Canada, from initial production to the first example taking part in a raid on Berlin.Greenwald 2004, p. 184. The film's French version title was Objectif Berlin.  Synopsis  In 1942, the Victory Aircraft company in Canada received notice that the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber would be built at their Malton, Ontario factory. After creating a supply chain of materials and components that can be obtained through Canadian sources, the factory ramps up by hiring nearly 10,000 workers and providing the specialized training and equipment necessary to turn out the largest aircraft ever produced in Canada. When the blueprints arrive on microfilm, the factory begins to train the toolmakers needed to manufacture the 55,000 components to build the first Canadian prototype Lancaster, Coded KB700 and named the \\"Ruhr Express\\", the bomber rolled out to much publicity. After its maiden flight by an all-Canadian Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) flight crew, the \\"Ruhr Express\\" takes off for England. Completing its ferry mission successfully, the Canadian Lancaster joins an operational squadron preparing for a raid on Berlin. The harrowing mission undertaken by the \\"Ruhr Express\\" is relayed all the way back to the Victory factory where workers pause to hear a radio broadcast of the Berlin attack. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, the Canadian Lancaster and its crew successfully complete their bombing mission. Production Typical of the NFB's Canada Carries On series of documentary short films, Target - Berlin incorporated filming at the Victory plant with combat footage from overseas.Khouri 2007, pp. 132‚Äì133. The film was \\"... aimed at giving Canadians a sense of pride in their new industrial capacity, in particular, to build the big Lancaster bomber which would bring Germany to its knees through bombing raids on its cities. The challenge of finding workers, particularly toolmakers, to produce the 55,000 parts needed to produce this splendid weapon was integrated with dramatic footage of a raid punctuated by the savage sounds of anti-aircraft guns and exploding bombs.\\" Relying heavily on the cooperation of the Royal Canadian Air Force, additional combat footage came from the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. Future NFB director and producer Grant McLean was the cinematographer on the documentary, later filming aboard the \\"Ruhr Express\\" on its bombing mission over Berlin.McIntosh, Andrew and Peter Morris. \\"Grant McLean.\\" The Film Reference Library.

Also notable was the involvement of composer Louis Applebaum whose martial score at times, merged \\"industrial noise\\" with symphonic music. He \\"... integrated with dramatic footage of a raid punctuated by the savage sounds of anti-aircraft guns and exploding bombs. By this point, Louis had learned how to use industrial noise along with the roaring sound of war machines, but his music was mainly martial in nature ‚Äî a glorious fanfare when the first Lancaster emerged from the hangar, a brass accompaniment as the first plane struggled into the sky, and a string intervention to signal the soaring triumph of successful flight. Louis had learned how to reach the emotional needs of his audience.\\"Pittman 2002, p. 49. Reception As part of the Canada Carries On series, Target - Berlin was produced in 35 mm for the theatrical market. Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB had an arrangement with Famous Players theatres to ensure that Canadians from coast-to-coast could see them, with further distribution by Columbia Pictures.Ellis and McLane 2005, p. 122. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. They were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities.

He was regarded as an influential leader of the African American community in St. Petersburg. For his service in the US Army Medical Reserve Corps during World War I, Ponder received a Presidential Citation.  Early life Ponder was born in Jacksonville, Florida to William and Addie (n√©e Williams) Ponder. He graduated from Howard Academy in Ocala and after attended Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina. In 1915, he graduated from Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee.  Career  After graduating from medical school, Ponder started a practice out of his house in Ocala. The kitchen was used as an emergency operating room. Ernest Ponder recalls victims of accidents and gunfights would appear at their home all hours of the night, and his father would care for their wounds. Payment frequently came in the form of poultry, vegetables, and ham. In 1917, Ponder served in the Army Medical Reserve Corps. He was First Lieutenant in the 368th Infantry of the 92nd Infantry Division. Many of the soldiers he cared for suffered injuries from gassings. His unit saw action in the Vosges Mountains, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, and near Metz. Ponder received a Presidential Citation for \\"meritorious service in the field of epidemic medicine.\\" This experience would give him a background in handling the smallpox epidemic in St. Petersburg in the late 1920s. He was honorably discharged on March 7, 1919. Following his service in World War I, Ponder returned to his home practice in Ocala. In 1924, he moved the family to St. Petersburg, Florida. It was here he was appointed assistant city physician. Ponder set up office in two rooms of a black-owned building, the Royal Express Bus Line. His practice was popular with thousands of African Americans who traveled to St. Petersburg to see him. In 1926, Ponder was appointed city physician for the underprivileged and African American community. He was the first African American admitted to practice at Mercy Hospital in St. Petersburg. He was responsible for the creation of Mercy's prenatal hospital wing, which served African Americans. As an influential leader of the African American community in St. Petersburg, Ponder held various leadership positions. He was the chairman of the Trustees for Black Schools in Pinellas County. His duty was to help improve black schools. Ponder was also the first African American to be elected as an active member of the Pinellas County Medical Society; as well as the first African American in Southern States to be given extended membership in the National Council of World War Veterans. Ponder was chosen as state commander, and he was in charge of bringing African American veterans together in Florida. Ponder retired in 1951.  Death  Ponder died on March 4, 1958 at Veterans Administration Hospital in Bay Pines, Florida. The cause of death was a heart attack. During his funeral, the flag at city hall was flown at half staff. A bronze plaque erected in his memory can be found in Bayfront Medical Center. He was survived by his widow, son, daughter, and three grandchildren.  Personal life  In 1917, Ponder married Fanny Ayer, a teacher. Their son Ernest was born on April 3, 1918. A graduate of Morehouse College, Ernest took over teaching duties for his mother's class at Gibbs High School when she was no longer able to teach due to poor health. James and Fanny adopted a girl named Florine sometime during the 1920s.

She began playing the violin at age three and has been performing at charity concerts since she was six. After following her performance at the 2010 Starkey Hearing Foundation Gala in Saint Paul, Minnesota when she was just eight years old, President Bill Clinton confided: \\"Wow.... If I could have played saxophone the way Brianna plays violin, I'd have gone into a different line of work.\\" She played on the Oprah Winfrey Show in March 2011 where she was welcomed as one of the most gifted children and a violin prodigy. Brianne Kahane was delighted at the encounter with Oprah: \\"It was the thrill of my life! I always wanted to meet her. I mean, she's my idol - working for charities, helping people around the world.\\" In 2011, when only nine, she entered the Juilliard School in New York City, one of the world's leading music schools. As the youngest recipient ever, she plays a violin from the Stradivari Society which means, she is considered playing on a level that is mature enouch to play a stradivarius violin and lucky her: she has the body size to play on a 4/4 sizes instrument which most 9 year olds don't have. That's necessary to get a stradivarius because there are no 1/2 oder 3/4 sized professional level quality instruments made by stradivarius.

It was organized by the Revolutionary Organization of the Fleet (Organiza√ß√£o Revolucion√°ria da Armada, ORA), a left-wing group with links to the Portuguese Communist Party. The mutiny broke out on 8 September 1936 among communist sailors in the Portuguese Navy's two newest warships moored in the estuary of the Tagus River near Lisbon. Their aim was ostensibly to take part in the Spanish Civil War alongside the Republicans by sailing to a Republican-held port in the Mediterranean. However, the revolt failed and the convicted sailors were the first to be sent to the Tarrafal prison camp established in the Cape Verde Islands to house political prisoners.  Background  In February 1936, a coalition of leftist groups won national elections in Spain. Conservative partisans sought refuge in Portugal, where a corporatist regime, the Estado Novo, established in 1926 and led by Premier Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, felt threatened by the change in power in Spain. Soon thereafter Spanish conservatives led by General Francisco Franco rebelled, initiating the Spanish Civil War. The Portuguese offered support to Franco's forces in defiance of a non-intervention agreement they had been pressured to sign by their ally, the United Kingdom. The British government warned the Portuguese that they would not be protected from Spanish leftist attack if they continued to involve themselves in the war, making the regime increasingly nervous about its position. While the Portuguese government increased its support of Franco, the Portuguese Communist Party stepped up its activism in opposition to the Estado Novo. Through the Revolutionary Organization of the Fleet (Organiza√ß√£o Revolucion√°ria da Armada, ORA)‚Äîwhich had grown in strength over the course of the early 1930s‚Äîthe party plotted a mutiny of several Portuguese Navy ships with intention of allowing them to sail to Spain to assist the Spanish government in the war. Mutiny The Portuguese fleet lay at anchor in the estuary of the Tagus River on 8 September 1936. The rebels planned to seize control of the ships present and the coastal forts. At 03:00 their ships were to begin their departure, following each other out at fifteen minute intervals.The Sydney Morning Herald, Friday 2 October 1936, p. 17 No word was received from the fort garrisons, so the rebels' plan would only work if they could embark before shore batteries came into action. However, a wireless operator tipped off the Portuguese Admiralty to the plan at around 01:00. A boat was immediately dispatched to survey the situation of the fleet. The aviso , pictured in 1935 Upon seeing the Admiralty launch, most of the Portuguese sailors realized their plot had been discovered and chose not to revolt. By then the crews of the and had already mutinied, forcing their officers below deck at gunpoint. The sailors on Afonso attempted to lure the Admiralty officers aboard, but the launch fled and the crew opened fire with machine guns. It took almost an hour before the alarm was raised ashore. When the forts were finally alerted, they could not target the mutineers' ships due to a heavy mist. The rebels were hesitant to leave without further orders from their leaders, and did not attempt a breakout until daylight. The Portuguese naval minister ordered coastal artillery to fire on any vessel attempting to leave the harbour. At 07:30 Afonso and D√£o raised steam and proceeded down the river at about . By then the mist had cleared and the shore batteries opened fire. Afonso responded but was soon struck. A loyal submarine opened fire on her with a machine gun. Afonsos bridge was destroyed in the engagement and her engines were crippled. D√£o, caught in the cross-fire between two forts, was also hit and both ships ran aground. The crews raised white flags to signal their surrender. Government forces boarded Afonso and arrested its crew. In an attempt to conceal their actions, several sailors stripped off their uniforms and attempted to swim ashore. Loyal Portuguese troops raked them with machine gun fire. The rebels were rounded up near Bel√©m Tower and taken prisoner. The leader of the revolt, a sailor from D√£o, committed suicide. Aftermath The Portuguese Ministry of Maritime Affairs reported that twelve sailors were killed and twenty wounded. 238 were arrested and deported to a penal colony on Santiago, Portuguese Cape Verde. The Ministry dismissed both crews in their entirety, reinstating sailors only if they were able to prove they resisted the mutiny. An investigation was also opened into discipline aboard the aviso Bartolomeu Dias. According to historian Glyn Stone, the revolt was \\"easily suppressed and remained an isolated incident\\" and did not pose a threat to Salazar. The German Ambassador to Portugal, Oswald von Hoyningen-Huene, reported that \\"it is even said that Salazar...provoked the dramatic development, or at the very least allowed matters to run their usual course.\\" The government framed the mutiny as a communist plot to surrender the Portuguese ships to the Spanish Republican Navy. On 9 September, Salazar issued an official statement. Framing the Spanish Civil War as an international conflict and warning of the dangers of leftist revolution spreading from Spain, he appealed for the creation of a new armed force to counter such a threat. The next day he introduced a law forcing all public servants to swear allegiance to the principles of his regime. On 30 September, an anti-communist paramilitary force, the Legi√£o Portuguesa, was formed. Communist activity in the Portuguese Armed Forces declined after the mutiny and remained minimal in the following years. Though it had dealt with the mutiny with force, the Portuguese government feared further revolts. Several days after the event the British press reported that several Portuguese Army units had rebelled, prompting the Portuguese embassy in London to issue a denial and declare the foreign press was depicting the Portuguese situation as chaotic to the Spanish government's benefit, and therefore the government was \\"obliged to intensify its offensive against communism\\". The mutiny ultimately strengthened Portuguese support for Franco's faction in the Spanish Civil War. In October the Portuguese government officially severed relations with the Spanish government. The mutiny forms of the backdrop for the 1984 novel The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis by Jos√© Saramago.

It is used to avoid sequential explicit null checks and assignments and replace them with method/property chaining. In programming languages where the navigation operator (e.g. \\".\\") leads to an error if applied to a null object, the safe navigation operator stops the evaluation of a method/field chain and returns null as the value of the chain expression. It is currently supported in languages such as Apex, Apache Groovy, Swift, Ruby, C#, Kotlin, CoffeeScript, Scala, Dart and others. There is currently no common naming convention for this operator, but safe navigation operator is the most widely used term. The main advantage of using this operator is that it avoids the pyramid of doom. Instead of writing multiple nested \`if\`s, programmers can just use usual chaining, but add question mark symbols before dots (or other characters used for chaining). While the safe navigation operator and null coalescing operator are both null-aware operators, they are operationally different. Examples= Apex = Safe navigation operator examples: a[x]?.aMethod().aField // Evaluates to null if a[x]  null a[x].aMethod()?.aField // returns null if a[x].aMethod() evaluates to null String profileUrl = user.getProfileUrl()?.toExternalForm(); return [SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Id = :accId]?.Name; =Groovy= Safe navigation operator and safe index operator: def name = article?.authors?[0].name =Objective-C= Normal navigation syntax can be used in most cases without regarding NULLs, as the underlying messages, when sent to NULL, is discarded without any ill effects.

If the type of the result of the member access is a value type, the type of the result of a null- conditional access of that member is a nullable version of that value type. The following example retrieves the name of the author of the first article in an array of articles (provided that each article has a \`Author\` member and that each author has an \`Name\` member), and results in \`null\` if the array is \`null\`, if its first element is \`null\`, if the \`Author\` member of that article is \`null\`, or if the \`Name\` member of that author is \`null\`. Note that an \`IndexOutOfRangeException\` is still thrown if the array is non-null but empty (i.e. zero-length). var name = articles?[0]?.Author?.Name; Calling a lambda requires \`callback?.Invoke()\`, as there is no null-conditional invocation (\`callback?()\` is not allowed). var result = callback?.Invoke(args); =Visual Basic .NET= Visual Basic 14 and above have the \`?.\` (the null-conditional member access operator) and \`?()\` (the null-conditional index operator), similar to C#.

Writing Fair wrote six novels of English village life that humorously and gently dissected the \\"polite social politics\\" of village denizens while managing to incorporate a romance or two. Reviewers typically compare her work to that of Margery Sharp or Angela Thirkell, with Stevie Smith and other reviewers noting that her work has affinities with Trollope. Of her novel All One Summer, the author wrote that it was meant for people like herself who \\"prefer not to take life too seriously\\". Writer Compton Mackenzie said of this novel that it was \\"in the best tradition of English humour\\". Fair's third novel, The Native Heath (1954) was published with a jacket design by Shirley Hughes. Fair published her last novel in 1960 and died in 1997.

She is credited with modernizing the day care system in Massachusetts. Early life and education She was born in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1899, the youngest of four children. Howard Thurman, who lived nearby, was a childhood playmate. She attended the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute and graduated from Talladega College in 1922. That same year, as a teacher at the Daytona School, she witnessed a confrontation between the school's founder, Mary McLeod Bethune, and the Ku Klux Klan. Soon afterwards she married attorney Joseph S. Mitchell and moved to the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. While raising her two children, Joseph and Laura, she took courses at the Nursery Training School with nursery school movement pioneer Abigail Adams Eliot. She earned a master's degree in early childhood education from Boston University in 1935. Her husband was assistant attorney general of Massachusetts from 1945 to 1949; he was also a playwright. Her son, Joseph S. Mitchell, Jr., became the second African American to serve as a superior court judge in Massachusetts when he was appointed by governor John Volpe in 1966. Career From 1932 to 1953 she directed the nursery school at Robert Gould Shaw House, a settlement house and community center. Under her direction it became a model school to which student teachers were sent to observe and practice. She was a co-founder of Associated Day Care Services of Metropolitan Boston, and later served as its educational director and acting executive director. In 1953 she was appointed by the governor of Massachusetts, Christian Herter, to a special commission to study day care licensing. After years of research and activism, a state licensing law was finally passed in 1962 under Governor Volpe. Mitchell then worked with the Massachusetts Department of Education to develop affordable training courses for day care workers. She is considered a pioneer in early childhood education. After retiring from Associated Day Care Services of Metropolitan Boston, Mitchell trained Peace Corps volunteers to work with children; consulted for the national Head Start Program and helped implement the program in Boston; helped Muriel Snowden establish Freedom House in Roxbury; was president of the Boston Association for the Education of Young Children; and served on the boards of various agencies, including the Boston YWCA and United Community Services of Metropolitan Boston. She died in a nursing home in New Rochelle, New York, the day before her 103rd birthday. Honors and awards In 1977 an oral history of Mitchell's life was recorded for the Black Women Oral History Project at the Schlesinger Library of Radcliffe College. She received a Distinguished Citizen Award from the City of Boston in 1979. She was awarded an honorary degree by Wheelock College in 1988. Her home on Waumbeck Street in Roxbury is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. Publications * External links *Lucy Miller Mitchell Papers, 1919-1988 MC 812; Vt-253.
