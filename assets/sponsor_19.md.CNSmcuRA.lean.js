Built in 1938, the same year as the village mosque, the church is the only Catholic church in Gjilan, near the point where Kosovo, Serbia, and North Macedonia meet. Description The foundation is stone, while the walls are made from bricks bound with lime mortar. The fa√ßade wall is built from multicolored tuff mortared with jointed concrete. Left of the entrance, the square bell tower is high; its fa√ßade includes a niche at the front door's height and four narrow windows for illumination, while the tower's narrowest section tapers to a cross up top. Above the doorway, a simple plaque reads \\"Kisha Katolike e Sh√´n An√´s , 1938\\" (\\"St. Anne‚Äôs Catholic Church, 1938\\"). Two doors beside the front one were closed before the last renovation in 2012, one leading to the bell tower and the other to the confessional. A narrow hall leads directly into the nave, with the chapel accessible from three parallel entrances and containing pews on either side of the central aisle. The chapel is domed and has three stained glass windows on the side wall, ending in a transept with two side alcoves and a circular apse with its own outer circular window. The only relic of the original chancel by that apse is the altar table, and the eastern apse connects with the church annexes. The roof, upgraded with gutters in 2012, is dual, with a lower surface above the transept and a higher one above the apse. A statue of Our Lady of Good Friday was removed from this church and moved to the church of Saint Anthony of Padua in Binaƒç. The church in is a prime location, with a churchyard reaching down toward in a terrace wall at the bottom of a hill. The yard is surrounded by poplars, some pines, and some lime trees. Though summers are quite hot at of altitude, a light north‚Äìsouth breeze cools. Although the church is not as popular as it once was as a place of worship, the church grounds have played host since 2011 to the Gjilan-based Beqir Musliu Arts Club's regional poetry festival known as the Trek√´nd√´shi Poetik (\\"Poetic Triangle\\").

Her group combines genetic data with molecular data to understand the origins and mechanisms of disease.  Early life and education  Finucane grew up in Maryland. She has said that her family enjoyed music and science. Finucane became interested in policy as a child, and started an Amnesty International student chapter at her high school. She was an undergraduate student at Harvard College, where eventually majored in mathematics and spent her spare time taking part in chamber music. After graduating from Harvard in 2009 Finucance moved to Israel where she joined the Weizmann Institute of Science. Here she focussed on theoretical computer science, completing a dissertation on geometric group theory. She developed an analytical tool (the Maximal information coefficient) that allows users to search complex data sets in an effort to identify meaningful relationships. Finucane became interested in the application of complex theoretical mathematics to the real world. She returned to the United States in 2012, where she worked toward a doctorate in applied mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She eventually started working with Alkes Price, with whom she developed statistical methods for understanding the genetic basis of human disease. In particular, Finucane considered how specific parts of the genome relate to activity in different cell types, making use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to model these relationships.  Research and career  Finucane was appointed a Schmidt Fellow at the Broad Institute. She was awarded an National Institutes of Health Independence Award to combine data from ENCODE, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, with GWAS and other biological information to better understand the cell types relevant to a particular disease. Soon after joining the Broad Institute, Finucane was made Associate Director of Medical and Population Genetics.  Selected publications    Personal life  Finucane is married to Yakir Reshef, a computer scientist who works on the immune system. She met him during middle school.

In 2008, her works were presented together with those of Agnete Bjerre in an exhibition at Vr√• where she was a member of the cultural association from 1956.

From her d√©but in 1951, L√ºtken developed her monumental figure style, becoming a distinctive contributor to Danish painting. She frequently used her mother and grandmother as models, her female figures extending over most of the painting surface. Her figures are usually combined with details such as the side of a chair leg or a table top, resulting in their appearance as part of a spatial whole. In her well balanced compositions, dark brown, green and greyish black areas form contrasts with a few much brighter areas. In her most successful works, the figures present stunning expressions of human existence. In 2008, her works were presented together with those of Agnete Bjerre in an exhibition at Vr√•.

Hofkens (13 October 1894 ‚Äì 9 January 1972) was a Belgian colonial administrator. He was governor of Lusambo / Kasa√Ø in the Belgian Congo from 1945 to 1948. Life L√©on Hofkens was born in Brussels, Begium, on 13 October 1894. He obtained a normal school diploma, and worked for six years as a teacher in Brussels. In July 1920 he joined the territorial service in the Belgian Congo. Hofkens' first assignment was as a territorial agent in the territory of Lodja, Sankuru District. During his second term he was territorial administrator of Lusambo, then of Dimbelenge, a new territory that he was responsible for organizing. In 1927 he was made deputy district commissioner of Sankuru. From 1931 to 1933 he was deputy district commissioner of Bas-Congo District, then from 1934 to 1941 titular district commissioner of Bas-Congo. At the start of World War II (1939-1945), in the second half of 1939 the administration was concerned about the politico-religious Mission des Noirs (Mission of the Blacks) movement, associated with Kimbanguism and the Salvation Army. On 5 December 1939 Marcel Maquet wrote to governor general Pierre Ryckmans opposing measures of clemency to Kimbanguists who renounced that movement, then returned to it. On 10 December 1939 Hofkens gave secret instructions to administrators in Bas-Congo in which he confirmed that he thoughr the Mission des Noirs was xenophic and subversive, but proposed that the natives who followed the movement should not be seen as vulgar delinquents, but as being engaged in a dangerous adventure. Persuasion was the way to bring them to their senses, rather than repression. He proposed that repeat offenders be subject to relatively small fines or penal servitude, proportional to the offense, and the leader of a village or organizer of a meeting should be punished rather than all the people. Hofkens' 7th term started in 1941, when he was appointed provincial commissioner of Sankuru, holding office until 1943. In 1945 the districts of Kasai (capital at Luebo), Sankuru (capital at Lusambo) and Lomami (capital at Kabinda) were reorganized in the Kasa√Ø Province, with its capital at Luluabourg. Hofkens was appointed governor of Lusambo Province on 21 September 1945. He replaced Ren√© P. Preys. In 1947 the name of the province was changed to Kasa√Ø Province. Hofkens held office until 19 July 1948. He was replaced by Firmin Peigneux. Hofkens was made a member of the Royal Order of the Lion on 8 April 1947. On 20 August 1949 Leon-A.-F. Hofkens, honorary provincial governor, was promoted to the rank of commander of the order. Hofkens died in Taintignies, Hainaut, Belgium, on 9 January 1972.

The ship was originally planned to have a cost of about ‚Ç¨80 million and enter service late in the decade. The ‚Ç¨113.8 million contract for overall engineering and construction of the ship was awarded to Kongsberg. Construction of Atair was sub-contracted to two German shipyards--Fassmer Werft and German Naval Yards (GNY). Construction began in December 2017, and the hull and superstructure were launched at German Naval Yards in February 2019. Following some fitting out work, including the installation of the main powerplants, Atair was transported to Fassmer Werft the following month to be completed. Sea trials began in late 2019 and continued through September 2020 ahead of the expected delivery of Atair late in 2020.

She was portrayed by Emma Stone in the films The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. As opposed to taking a supporting role in the previous film trilogy, Gwen is given a prominent role in Webb's films as one of Peter Parker's classmates, serving as his primary love interest and a foil to his character. Webb based Gwen's character off of her traditional comic-book portrayal. For her performance in the films, Stone has received critical praise and wider recognition. Character development and execution=Origins and casting The character of Gwen Stacy first appeared The Amazing Spider-Man #31 in 1965. Intended to be Spider-Man's primary love interest, she was soon superseded in popularity by Mary Jane Watson in that role by fans. This eventually led to the now-controversial decision by Spider-Man writers to kill off Gwen, which served as one of the most pivotal moments in comic-book history; Spider-Man's failure to save Gwen was one of the first big failures by a superhero, and is regarded as the end of the Silver Age of Comic Books. The character has subsequently been cloned or revived several times or seen different iterations in the comics, including one as Spider-Gwen, and has been included in several television shows and cartoons based on Spider-Man. The first big-budget cinematic appearance of Gwen Stacy was in Spider-Man 3, with Bryce Dallas Howard portraying the character in a supporting role, as Mary Jane was already serving as Peter's main love interest in that trilogy. Following the cancellation of Spider-Man 4 and reboot of the Spider-Man film series, it was originally reported that both Gwen and Mary Jane would appear in the first film of the new series before Gwen was confirmed as the only one of Peter's love interests to appear. The shortlist of actresses to play the role included Lily Collins, Ophelia Lovibond, and Imogen Poots, with Teresa Palmer, Emma Roberts, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter as \\"potentially in the mix\\". In September 2010, Variety reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Emma Stone and Mia Wasikowska. After a few more actresses were considered, Stone was announced as the winner of the role in October 2010 due to her chemistry with Spider-man actor Andrew Garfield. That chemistry later inspired their off-screen romance. Emma Stone portrayed Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel. For the role, Stone kept her natural blonde hair color to match Gwen's depiction in the comic books, rather than maintaining her usual dyed red hair. She felt that she had a responsibility to educate herself on Spider-Man, admitting she \\"hadn't read the comic book growing up, and my experience was with the Sam Raimi movies... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love\\", and having only been familiar with Howard's portrayal in Spider-Man 3. Stone said, \\"There's a part of me that really wants to please people [who] love Spider-Man or Gwen Stacy and want her to be done justice. I hope they'll give me license to interpret her my way.\\" While The Amazing Spider-Man director Marc Webb introduced a few elements from Ultimate Spider-Man, he wanted to keep the mainstream version of Gwen Stacy instead of that world's punk rocker, though he states that the \\"texture\\" of the romantic relationship between her and Peter is based on that of the Ultimate versions of Peter and Mary Jane. Despite her character's death in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Stone expressed interest in returning as a resurrected Stacy in a future The Amazing Spider-Man film in an interview with Screen Rant.https://screenrant.com/emma-stone-amazing-spider-man-3-gwen-stacy- clone-carnage/ By July 2014, development of follow-ups Sinister Six, The Amazing Spider-Man 3, and The Amazing Spider-Man 4 had stalled; the films would have seen Stone reprise her role, the plot following a returned Norman Osborn setting a resurrected amnesiac Gwen as Carnage against Peter, Harry Osborn, and the Sinister Six. By early 2015, a deal to reboot the series within the Marvel Cinematic Universe was reached, effectively cancelling the franchise The Amazing Spider-Man. Characterization and themes Sony Pictures' official website for The Amazing Spider-Man described Gwen Stacy as \\"smart, charismatic and rebellious\\". Stone described her character as \\"a daddy's girl\\" who is very responsible and protective of her family and loves science. She said of her character, \\"she offers Parker a world of stability, of a family unit not marred with parental loss and, beyond physical allure, the two forge an intellectual connection over their shared love of science.\\" Her character, she explained, \\"is stuck between [her father] the Captain and Peter Parker and Spider-Man, who have different ways about going about finding justice in their lives\\" which she felt was a fun thing to explore. Dana Stevens of Slate described the character \\"as the stuff of a comic nerd's dreams: a sweet, smart, wisecracking dame in demure sweaters, miniskirts, thigh-high stockings and boots.\\" Gwen and Peter's relationship is further explored in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. When asked about their relationship in the sequel, Stone said, \\"She saves him more than he saves her. She's incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... He's the muscle, she's the brains.\\" Emily Kubincanek of Film School Rejects observes that unlike Mary Jane Watson, the primary love interest in the Raimi trilogy, Gwen Stacy, as portrayed in Marc Webb's films, provides a \\"feeling of partnership\\" in her relationship with Peter Parker and is more than willing to aid him in his battles, even at the cost of her own life when she helps him against Electro and is subsequently targeted and killed by the Green Goblin. Film Appearances=The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) Gwen first appears as the daughter of NYPD captain George Stacy and as a classmate to Peter Parker and Flash Thompson at Midtown Science High School. She breaks up a fight between the two, admonishing Flash for not finishing his homework and for beating up Peter, then later commends the latter for standing up to Flash. Peter and Gwen begin to develop a mutual interest in each other from that point onwards. They encounter each other later at Oscorp, where Gwen is interning as a research assistant, as Peter sneaks into the facility to find Dr. Curt Connors and is later bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him new abilities. Gwen catches up with Peter after his Uncle Ben picks him up following after-school detention, and later consoles Peter after Ben's death. After Peter starts tracking down Ben's killer as a masked vigilante, Gwen invites him to dinner with her family, where Peter and Captain Stacy argue about the vigilante's motives. Afterwards, Peter reveals to her that he is, in fact, the vigilante, sharing a kiss with her. Gwen also plays a crucial part in The Lizard's defeat; having helped Peter develop an antidote for Connors' serum for turning people into reptilian hybrids using her own scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, her father is killed by The Lizard before Peter can defeat the villain. George makes Peter promise to keep Gwen out of his dangerous life. Peter honors that vow without immediately telling Gwen, which offends her until she realizes what her father did and forgives Peter. However, when Peter later hints that he's reconsidering keeping that vow, she quietly smiles at this development. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) Two years later, Gwen and Peter are graduating from high school. She calls him, telling him that he'll be \\"late\\" to the graduation ceremony while unbeknownst to her, he is in action as Spider-Man helping the NYPD apprehend Aleksei Sytsevich. Peter arrives just after Gwen finishes her speech as valedictorian to collect his diploma, kissing her in front of the crowd. Gwen and Peter talk where she invites him to dinner before she was called by her mother for a family photo. Later in the evening, Peter tells Gwen about the visions of her father he's been having and insists that he needs to keep his promise which as a result, Gwen breaks up with Peter. Gwen is seen then working at Oscorp and meets Max Dillon in an elevator, where she finds out his birthday and the fact that he is obsessed with Spider-Man. She later meets up with Peter again, in which they try to maintain their friendship and establish some \\"ground rules\\". Gwen tells Peter that she is trying to apply for a scholarship to Oxford University, meaning she has to move to England if she gets it. Before the two can discuss it, Max, having suffered an industrial accident and become Electro, shuts off the power to Times Square whilst looking for electricity to power himself. Gwen recognizes Max and starts asking questions; Donald Menken, a high ranking and mutinous Oscorp board member, decides that she is a threat, fires her and targets her for elimination. In the chaos, she also encounters Harry Osborn. Gwen later leaves Peter a voicemail, saying that she got the position at Oxford and has to leave early for a flight. Peter catches up to her and declares his love for her, agreeing to accompany her to England. They are interrupted by an intentional blackout caused by Electro. Peter takes Gwen down where the police are and Gwen helps him with his web-shooters to go against Electro. Peter heads off to fight with Electro having the upper-hand. As Electro has Spider- Man in the air and is electrocuting him, Gwen comes in a police car and hits Electro, against Peter's demands. The two defeat and kill Electro by overloading his electricity supply. Just after they do so, Harry arrives, now as the Green Goblin, having figured out Spider-Man's identity and wanting revenge for being refused the life-saving blood transfusion. Goblin takes Gwen and drops her where Spider-Man catches her. The two fight at the top of a clock tower, and Spider-Man manages to subdue the Goblin. However, during the fight, Gwen falls and is supported by a web connected to one of the gears. The gears gives way which cuts the web, and Gwen again falls. Goblin is then defeated and Peter tries to save Gwen using his web. Though Peter successfully catches her inches from the ground, she dies nonetheless due to whiplash snapping her neck. Devastated by his failure to save his girlfriend, Peter ends his career as Spider-Man. Five months pass and Spider-Man is nowhere to be seen in New York, as Peter spends every day at Gwen's grave. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich dubs himself the \\"Rhino\\" and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by re-watching Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man, and confronts him. Comic appearances=Marvel Infinite Tie-in comics Gwen appears in comics that tie into both films in the series, helping Peter redesign his Spider-Man suit and attempting to maintain a friendship with him after their initial breakup before resuming their relationship. In other media=Video games *This version of the character also appears in The Amazing Spider-Man movie video game, voiced by Kari Wahlgren. Several months after the film, Gwen continues to work at Oscorp, and occasionally provides assistance to Spider-Man. *Gwen Stacy does not appear in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie video game, but is mentioned by Peter Parker while speaking to his Aunt May when he excuses himself to leave the house and pretend to check up on Gwen during an attack on Oscorp (when in reality, she wasn't present at the incident). Beenox confirmed that the character was excluded from the plot so the game doesn't generate spoilers for the then-upcoming film. Reception Emma Stone's performance as Gwen Stacy has received positive reviews and led to wider recognition for the actress, as she was nominated for several awards, winning \\"Favorite Movie Actress\\" at the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards. Critics praised Stone's chemistry with Andrew Garfield in both The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and the fact that her character was significantly more fleshed-out than the Gwen Stacy of the Sam Raimi trilogy. In a review of the first film, Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline wrote that she \\"had no specific desire to see the series resuscitated. But watching Garfield and Stone made me think doing so wasn't such a bad idea\\". Following the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Alison Willmore of BuzzFeed cited Stone's performance and the love story of two people \\"hopelessly smitten with each other\\" as the highlights of the film, with the other subplots and villains serving to \\"complicate the relationship between Peter and Gwen.\\" She also called the love story \\"uncommonly appealing\\" for an otherwise clich√© superhero film.

A critic noted \\"with an eye for realism and a talent for profound dialogue, Ananthu makes this a memorable entry into the annals of parallel cinema.\\" Work with Kamal Haasan Ananthu was considered by Kamal Haasan as a close associate and mentor. Through Ananthu, Kamal Haasan was able to maintain close ties with K. Balachander. In the early 1970s, Kamal Haasan had become jaded and suicidal with the monotonous, low-key roles that he was receiving from Tamil cinema. He later credited Ananthu for reinvigorating his interest in films, after taking up his suggestion of moving to work on Malayalam films. During the period, Ananthu continued to nurture Kamal Haasan's talent by evaluating his on-screen performances and by introducing him to world cinema. Kamal Haasan has also credited Ananthu for teaching him screenwriting. Ananthu continued to work closely with Kamal Haasan for a number of his films in the 1990s through various capacities. He was behind the title of Nammavar, a term also later adapted by Kamal Haasan in his political activities. Following Ananthu's death in 1998, Kamal Haasan's first Tamil directorial venture Hey Ram (2000) was dedicated to Ananthu. After winning the Henri Langlois award in 2016, Kamal Haasan dedicated the award to Ananthu. An official portrait of Ananthu was inaugurated in 2019 at Kamal Haasan's offices as a part of celebrations marking the actor's 60th year in the film industry.

A leader of the Uyghur New Poetry (gungga) movement in the 1980s, he is considered one of the \\"foremost Uyghur poets of his generation\\". His use of free verse was influential in subsequent Uyghur poetics. His poetry has been described as trying to \\"capture the sacred and philosophical, the ineffable and the transient, in a wholly unique lyric voice\\".  Early life  He grew up in √úr√ºmqi, the largest city in Xinjang. His father Osman Bey, a coal mine manager, was imprisoned for six years during the Cultural Revolution for being \\"bourgeois capitalist\\". He spent years in and out of the hospital after his release and passed away from lung disease. His mother, Cemile Hanƒ±m, taught him Uyghur folk tales and took care of their family, which included Osman's two siblings. His father's death and his mother's singing folk poetry to him influenced his work. Osman started writing poetry when he was twelve or thirteen years old. His work was first \\"published\\" when three of his poems were read on air by a radio station in Urumqi when he was thirteen. In 1979, he won the first prize for children's literature. After going to a famous experimental high school in √úr√ºmqi, he entered Xinjiang University's Faculty of Language and Literature in 1981. His first Uyghur-language poetry collection was published in 1982. In 1982, he went to Syria to study Arabic literature at Damascus University. He completed bachelor's and master's degree in Arabic literature. He returned to √úr√ºmqi in 1990. He struggled to find work due to his meetings with Uyghur separatists abroad. (In 1984, while studying in Syria, he secretly traveled to Istanbul and met Uyghur separatists. Later, he visited Uyghurs in Saudia Arabia, too.) He was even unable to get a job at Xinjiang University, his alma mater. For a year, he worked with Rebiya Kadeer, a Uyghur businesswoman and a senior figure in the Uyghur World Congress, in a company that restored ancient houses. He also worked as a journalist and continued to write. He made a splash with his controversial essays on literary theory.  Exile  In 1994, he was arrested by the Chinese government for two months and then fled to Syria. While in Syria, he reoriented himself toward Arabic poetry and occasionally contributed to Radio Free Asia's Uyghur service. While in Syria, he married a Syrian Alawite woman. In 2004, he was deported from Syria under pressure from the Chinese government. Upon learning of his expulsion, 270 figures from the world of Arab poetry (including renowned Syrian poet Adunis) signed a petition and staged a demonstration against the deportation order. The action was condemned by international Arabic newspapers in London and Lebanon. He left for Turkey, where he spent a few days, but again was deported due to Chinese government pressure. He finally received asylum in Canada, where he has been living since October 2004. There, he found work at a grocery store, a coffee factory, and as a forklift operator in a warehouse.  Activism  Osman met Uyghur separatists in Turkey as a college student in Syria and visited more in Saudi Arabia later. He served as the president of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile from November 2015 to October 2018, when he was dismissed for violating the East Turkistan Government in Exile's Constitution. Despite his involvement in the Uyghur independence movement, Osman doesn't write poems explicitly about politics; his poems don't claim a particular political ideology.  Poetry = Influences  Early on while in Xinjiang, Osman was influenced by Uyghur folk poetry sung to him by his mother, Uyghur poets of the previous generation like Qurban Barat and Boghda Abddulla, classical Uyghur poets like the eighteenth-century Sufi poet Shah Meshrep, and what he could find in Uyghur- language translations: collections of Tang poetry and Lao Zi, the contemporary Misty Poets writing in Mandarin, early nineteenth-century English and Russian Romantic poetry, and the essays of Vissarion Belinsky, the critic who originated of Russian social realism in the 1840s. Later, he picked up modernists like Paul Celan, St√©phane Mallarm√©, and Arthur Rimbaud. Once in Damascus, he immersed himself in Arabic literature, reading influential poets like the Syrian Adunis. According to critic Andre Naffis-Sahely, Adunis seemed to have a significant effect on Osman's work: \\"many of Osman‚Äôs poems marry lyrical descriptions of the natural world with the human need to ask metaphysical questions\\" and he \\"seems to have adopted Adunis‚Äôs use of the qit‚Äôa (or fragment) as one of the primary vessels for his poetics, juxtaposing images to create a vortex of sights, sounds, and ideas that always circle back to raw emotion\\". In turn, Adunis was one of the earliest admirers of Osman's Arabic poetry.  The Uyghur New Poetry movement (gungga)  In the 1980s, Osman was one of the leaders of the Uyghur New Poetry movement, known as gungga (hazy, vague, or uncertain) in Uyghur. There were several strands of influences that affected this movement. Symbolism and surrealism had just arrived in Xinjiang, after a long period of isolation from the 1950s to the 1980s. The experience of political repression during that era also drove them to more indirect means of expression. The direct inspiration, however, came from the Misty Poets group of the late 1970s and early 1980s (gungga was a direct translation of menglong, \\"obscure\\", \\"misty\\", or \\"hazy\\" in Mandarin.) The movement absorbed \\"the vision and the aesthetic principles of that groundbreaking movement through the literary manifestations were necessarily different.\\" The gungga movement's works were in free verse, not the Aruz or syllabic metrical forms then dominant in Uyghur poetry. They relied on metaphor, contrast, images and symbols, instead of more direct means of expression. Their titles didn't directly relate to the bodies of the poems. Osman's choice of subjects included home, nation, and longing. He gained critical attention after his poem Hain Daƒülar (\\"Treacherous Mountains\\") was published by the popular literary magazine Tangritagh, based in √úr√ºmqi. After that, he published his poems regularly in the magazine, which became the center of the movement. According to Osman and Ablikim Baqi, the editor of Tangritagh, gungga \\"demonstrated an opening out of traditional form and content, an art unfettered by any implicit message of 'social value', and offered a new vision of Uyghur poetry as attuned to the French symbolists Baudelaire and Mallarm√©, the surrealists Breton and Aragon, as well as to Manichean scripture and the Sufi poets Shah Meshrep and Ali-Shir Nava'i.\\" These views were a departure from Maoist ideas of art as \\"proletarian revolutionary utilitarianism\\", and closer to Western Modernism's focus on \\"psychologizing, subjective, sometimes surreal art.\\" The movement started a fierce debate around tradition and authenticity in Uyghur letters. Critics of the movement said gungga poets simply lacked the skill to compose classical Uyghur poetry, with its strict metrical forms. The school's adherents countered that experimentation was crucial to the vitality and relevance of Uyghur poetry. The movement declined after Osman's immigration to Syria in 1994 and his subsequent reorientation toward Arabic poetry. However, it left a mark on contemporaries like Perhat Tursun and Tahir Hamut and the next generation of Uyghur poets, who continued to write in free verse.  Translations  He has translated the poems of Rumi, Octavio Paz, Paul Celan, Fernando Pessoa, and Adunis into Uyghur. His eight collections of poetry (six in Arabic and two in Uyghur) have been published in Syria and Xinjiang. At times, Osman has composed Arabic and Uyghur versions of a poem simultaneously over a period of years. Jeffrey Yang published a collection of translations of Osman's Arabic and Uyghur poetry in Uyghurland in 2015; it was the first collection of Uyghur poetry to be translated into English. The translation was long-listed for the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation. Osman's work has also been anthologized in The Heart of Strangers, a collection of exile literature edited by Andre Naffis-Sahely.

The current flag was adopted in 1958 and is credited to Michael J. Spahr and Karen Kress. It commemorates the Wright brothers, who lived in Dayton. A contest is underway to choose a new design to replace the current flag. Design The flag is set against a royal blue field. It features a royal blue Wright Flyer superimposed on a gray globe with white graticule lines, representing the aviation industry's global reach. The globe is surrounded by a white cogwheel, representing Dayton as a manufacturing hub. The name \\"DAYTON\\" is inscribed along the mast in white, slab serif lettering. History=Griep flag Dayton adopted its first flag on August 1, 1917. It was a vertical triband divided into two vertical bands of deep orange on either side and a larger band of white down the middle. The middle band contained a navy blue silhouette of a Wright Flyer encircled in rings of orange and navy blue, representing the globe. The name \\"DAYTON\\" was inscribed within the rings in navy blue. The flag was designed the previous year by Mabel Griep, an assistant art teacher at Steele High School who was childhood friends with Katharine Wright, sister of the Wright brothers. According to Griep, the blue represented loyalty, the white represented civic righteousness, and orange represented agricultural resources. The same city ordinance that specified the flag also specified a city pennant, similarly a triband of deep orange and white. The white band contained the name \\"DAYTON\\", set in navy blue lettering decreasing in size from mast to fly. Spahr‚ÄìKress flag On January 23, 1956, the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce urged the city commission to consider replacing the flag, then held a contest to choose the replacement in 1958. On June 11, 1958, a six-person committee selected a combination of two designs by Michael J. Spahr and Karen Kress. 2020 redesign In 2018, Mayor Nan Whaley convened a committee to replace the flag after hearing a TED talk by Roman Mars. From October 1 to December 9, 2019, the 20-person committee received 312 proposals mostly from residents of the Miami Valley area. The committee required submissions to have a proportion of 1:1.67 and adhere to the North American Vexillological Association's five principles of flag design. In 2020, the city commission and mayor selected three finalists. Based on public feedback, either one of the finalists will be selected as the new flag, or a graphic designer will incorporate the finalists' designs into a new design.

For the third album in the row, a new bassist is featured with Greg Smith from The Weakerthans taking over for long time Ron Hawkins collaborator Derrick Brady. The record is very much a product of its time; a collection of protest songs that speak to what's going on in the world. Songwriter Ron Hawkins explains: \\"It‚Äôs been a while since I felt the need to take the small p in the politics of my songwriting and capitalize it. But with fascism on the rise again throughout the world it‚Äôs time to hit ‚Äòcaps lock‚Äô on that P once again.‚Äù With the band signed to a major label, Warner Music Canada, the band had the support to seek out a \\"name\\" producer for the project and, as big fans of The Clash, they targeted Mick Jones (The Clash Guitarist). When that didn't pan out, a mutual friend then suggested Grammy winning producer David Bottrill on the record. Hawkins, who had issues the last time The Low worked with a \\"name\\" producer (Don Smith) had a much better connection with Bottrill and unveiled an aggressive plan for the recording sessions. \\"At the beginning I said ‚ÄòOkay, I booked fourteen days in the studio, we‚Äôre going to do fourteen songs‚Äô and he was like ‚ÄòAhhhh, that‚Äôs fucking crazy dude, you know, that‚Äôs really ambitious.‚Äù Ultimately they recorded 14 songs in 19 days. Hawkins described the finished record as \\"songs about revolution and redistribution‚Ä¶liberation, love and justice,\\" written in response to the current world we live in.\\" The album features one track, 'Bottle Rockets' that for the first time in the band's history has multiple songwriters credited. Previously all the material was written by Hawkins with a few tracks written by former guitarist Stephen Stanley but 'Bottle Rockets' features the full band receiving a writing credit and ex-bassist Dylan Parker getting a credit as well. The political nature of the music did cause some friction within the band. The first single, 'The Barricade' features the lyric \\"My next vote's with a brick\\" and some band members were uncomfortable with the suggestion that violence is the answer. ‚ÄúWe had some band discussion and the band wasn‚Äôt exactly sure that we were representing ourselves, our fans with it,‚Äù Hawkins said. ‚ÄúWe talked it out and it stayed in the song.\\" In a four star review from Spill Magazine, they praised the albums ability to balance big political ideas and hope. \\"Lyrically, this purposeful 14-track, 48-minute album, contains a decidedly political theme. While politics can be a somewhat depressing subject nowadays, Hawkins injects his lyrics with hope, unity, and a call to living in the now. The energy is contagious, making this brilliant album a striking, singable, and most of all optimistic offering about affecting change for the better.\\" \\"The Barricade\\" was released as the album's first single on May 1.

Reza Shirmarz was elected as a member of the board of directors of Iran's Playwrights Guild for 3 ongoing years. He has been a professional member of bodies such as Iran's Playwrights Guild, Pen America and Dramatists Guild of America. He also is a language specialist and a full member of Chartered Institute of Linguists (CIOL) in London.  Early life  Reza Shirmarz was born in Khoy and raised in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. His mother, a kind-hearted housewife as well as an art lover, although not highly educated and his father a ground forces general who had no interest in art despite of his hidden artistic talent, taught him synchronously love and discipline. Reza is a born bilingual. He has been speaking Persian and Turkish since his birthday. He is a left-handed and fought against his congenital dyslexia for years and overcame it after more than a decade of vocal and speech exercises. In one of his recent interviews, he said that the first thing which connected him deeply to the phenomenon of language and its necessity to build up effective communication was his dyslexia and his efforts to overcome such a harsh condition. He used to go to the nearby mountainous suburb called Sorkheh Hesar and sing the songs he had already learned for hours. He said once: \\"I had a notebook in which I wrote my favorite songs one by one and practiced them repeatedly until I mastered them.\\" 267x267px Reza has been influenced profoundly by great modern and classic writers and thinkers since his childhood. In a way, he was raised in an intellectual milieu, since his siblings were all well-educated. He was at the beginning influenced by his brother who was a movie fan and now is a script-writer and film director as well as by his sister who was into social sciences especially sociology. He began to read Persian classic literature, especially Rumi, when he was a teen. He also was quite fascinated by modern short stories, particularly the works of great modern Iranian writer, Sadegh Hedayat. The first Persian book which influenced Reza to a great extent was Hedayat's Dash'Akol. He read it at the age of 13. He began to read intensively the non-Persian literature created by many different writers such has Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, Jane Austen, George Orwell, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Milton, Bront√´ family, Joseph Conrad, D. H. Lawrence, John Donne, William Butler Yeats, etc. after a couple of years. This was the first step for him to get familiar with western literature. Later on, Reza began to read more of ancient drama (Sophocles, Euripides, Aeschylus, Aristophanes, Menanderus, Seneca, Plautus, etc.), modern drama (Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Eugene O'Neill, Neil Simon, David Mamet, Samuel Shepard, Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Samuel Beckett, August Wilson, Edward Albee, George Bernard Shaw, August Strindberg, Anton Chekhov, Thornton Wilder, Luigi Pirandello, Sarah Kane, Bertolt Brecht, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Yasmina Reza, Somerset Maugham, Carlo Goldoni, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Clifford Odets, etc.) which strengthened his creative imagination. Such an intensive reading assisted him in his playwriting and translation career in the coming years. He said once: \\"Reading and translation were like workshops I attended in order to learn how to create drama.\\" Poetry is another branch of literature that the Iranian author and artist has pursued throughout his life. In addition to Iranian classic and modern poets (Hafez, Rumi, Ferdowsi, Saadi, Nezami, Khayyam, Attar, Abusa'id Abolkhayr, Parvin E'tesami, Forough Farrokhzad, Ahmad Shamlou, Simin Behbahani, Hushang Ebtehaj, Mehdi AkhavƒÅn-SƒÅles, Iraj Mirza, etc.), Reza attempted to go meticulously through the eastern and western poetry (Emily Dickinson, William Shakespeare, Robert Frost, Pablo Neruda, Oscar Wilde, John Keats, William Blake, William Wordsworth, Dante Alighieri, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, etc.) as well. In the coming years he wrote a book on modern English poets T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and William Butler Yeats.  Education  Reza was absorbed by books, especially literature and philosophy even before he was graduated from the high school. He showed interest in learning languages as well, especially English. He grew up in Tehran, where he finished his high school in the eastern part of Tehran and continued his undergraduate studies at the ECO College of Insurance Management which was an English speaking international school as well as an affiliate of Allameh Tabataba'i University. Although he never became a practitioner in business area, the school helped him master his English. Reza wished to become an architect, since he was able to draw three-dimensional object precisely. Even he made his attempt to finish a course on technical drawing or drafting with the help of his uncle who was a creative civil engineer, but he stopped it since writing and translating became the most important activities in his life.  Career overview  Reza Shirmarz working in his office in Iran, 2008 Reza Shirmarz wrote several plays of which two -Cinnamon Stars & Crystal Vines- were celebrated on a national scale in Fajr International Theater Festival and Iran's National Playwriting Contest. He also translated tens of plays and books by famous world dramatists and authors, including Aristophanes (11 plays), Menanderus (1 play), Plautus (20 plays), Terentius (2 plays), George Bernard Shaw (7 plays), Edward Bond (1 play), Somerset Maugham (5 plays), Terence Rattigan (2 plays), Clifford Odets (2 plays), Iakovos Kambanellis (6 plays), John Mortimer (5 plays), Arthur Watkyns & J.A. Ferguson, Edward Albee, Marjorie Bolton, Jean Paul Sartre, Jean Anouilh, etc. He is mostly specialised in theater and philosophy. His last book on Robert Wilson, well-known American theater director, was published in 2015 by Ghatreh publishing company in Tehran. One of his recent translations from Greek into Persian was Aristotle's Poetics which was published in 2018 in Tehran by a major publishing company called Ghoghnoos. Although some of his works were already published at the time of President Mohammad Khatami, they have been constantly censored and banned by the Iranian official authorities since the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinezhad, but he never gave up creating new pieces of art and translating drama and philosophy into Persian. More than six of his works, such as Cinnamon Stars, Crystal Vines, Deep Blue Sea, Yellow Snow Falls, etc. are officially announced as forbidden to be published and distributed. One of his translations is The Big knife by Clifford Odets which has been prohibited for more than a decade.  Theater Director  Reza Shirmarz is a stage director and has attempted to direct his own celebrated plays including Cinnamon Stars and Crystal Vines in Iran, but the governmental authorities stopped his productions and banned the both the plays and their performances. Some of Reza's professional group members cooperating in these productions were Ayda Keykhaei, Toofan Mehrdadi, Naseh Kamgari, Hamid Azarang, Hafez Ahi, etc. His plays are not only censored and banned to be performed in any form (stage, TV and radio), but also were proscribed to be published in Iran.  Vocal Training, Singing & Songwriting  350x350px Reza Shirmarz also did vocal and singing practice on a daily basis as well attending constantly the workshops of the legendary Iranian singers, Noureddin Razavi Sarvestani and Mohammad Nouri. One of his great vocal trainers is Alireza Shafaghinezhad, who is a leading famous conductor and composer in Iran. Reza is a baritone and has been singing occasionally in national art festivals as an honorary activity, e.g. in 2008 in Iranian Actors Festival. He also has been active as a voice and speech trainer for about two decades. The experiences he gained in his voice and speech workshops as a vocal educator led him to write a book called Stage Speech: Practical Exercises which was published in 2012 and has been reprinted 12 times in less than 8 years. This book is formed based on vocal exercises for amateur and professional art practitioners, especially actors, narrators, storytellers, lecturers, etc. In 2017, Reza conducted a voice and speech master workshop in Tehran training a group of professional theater and cinema actors. He has already translated a book on voice and speech called Speech for the Stage by Evangeline Machlin which has been republished 17 times in ten years. Reza Shirmarz has written several songs in Farsi and English. His songs were not permitted to be published or performed in Iran due to heavy governmental censorship, but some of his English songs were composed by Greek jazz composer and educator Antonis Ladopoulos to be performed by the Greek singer Maria Tsarouxa.  Migration  alt= Reza Shirmarz moved to Greece in 2010 in order to do research on ancient Greek culture and civilization, learn Greek language and translate Greek theatrical and philosophical works into Persian directly from Greek. Six plays of Iakovos Kambanellis were the first series of theatrical works he translated directly from Greek language into Persian. He has been translating the complete works of Aristotles into Persian language of which the first volume (The Poetics) was published in 2017. The book was sold out in a short time and was republished in 2020. He wrote several plays such as Immigrants, The Corners of Death, etc. while living in Greece.  Plays  *Cinnamon Stars (celebrated play in Fajr International Theater Festival and National Playwriting Competition, published by Namayesh Publication Center, 2007).

For her leading role in the Chamber of Councillors of S√£o Bernardo do Campo, she was honored with the name of the plenary of this legislative house. Political career Around 1943, she came to live in S√£o Bernardo, settling in a farm at the confluence of the roads Mar and Vergueiro. In late 1946 and early 1947, she embraced Adhemar de Barros's campaign for governor of the State of S√£o Paulo, and in the city she supported the popular movement of protest against the city hall, in the face of the problems of lack of sugar, oil and other items, gaining general sympathy. Adhemar de Barros, after being elected and sworn in as governor, removed Wallace Simonsen from the city hall and appointed Tereza as mayor in a buffer mandate, taking office in 1947. She would remain in office until the end of that year, when elections were held for councilman and mayor. Tereza Delta was elected a councilwoman with the highest number of votes ever recorded in S√£o Bernardo until then. She was elected mayor of the Chamber between 1948 and 1951, when she stepped aside to take up a seat in the State Assembly, to which she had been elected as a congresswoman, serving from 1951 to 1955. During this mandate she swas responsible for the creation of the first state school in the city, the Instituto de Educa√ß√£o Jo√£o Ramalho, the construction of the Maria Iracema Munhoz School Group building, the construction of the viaduct at kilometer 23 of the Anchieta Highway and also the completion by the State of the works of the first public hospital in the city, today called Hospital Escola Anchieta. At the same time, she coordinated the construction and succeeded, in 1953, in raising the municipality to the category of comarca, whose forum was installed two years later by the acting mayor, Sigismundo S√©rgio Ballotim. In 1960, she again served as a State Congresswoman, as an alternate called for a temporary seat in the State Legislative Assembly. After she withdrew from politics, she continued to devote herself to the activities of a micro-entrepreneur and died on August 6, 1993.

Early life Finley was born in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1922 and attended the University of Virginia. While a student there he became involved in evangelism on campus and founded a large student ministry. In his senior year he became the national inter- collegiate boxing champion. His fame as a Christian athlete drew large crowds to Youth for Christ rallies where he served alongside Billy Graham as a field evangelist for the new ministry. After World War II, Bob went to the Far East to hold large evangelistic meetings with Youth for Christ, and was personally supported by Billy Graham. While serving in Korea, China and Japan, Bob caught a vision for supporting native evangelists which he observed to be far more effective than foreigners.Finley, Bob. Apostolic Adventures, Charlottesville 2012. (Charlottesville: CAM Press), 2012. Career In 1953, Bob founded International Students, for the purpose of reaching college students from other countries who were coming to the United States for studying. He believed that by reaching these elite students, the gospel could be advanced in almost every country. As part of this strategy, Bob formed a division called Christian AID (Assisting Indigenous Developments), to help finance the ministry work of returning students to their country. By 1970 this division had grown to such an extent that it was spun off into a separate organization. Both ministries have grown considerably and become household names in evangelical Christian circles.

It was designed in the Gothic Revival style by the Bradford architect Henry Francis Lockwood, and opened in 1867. History The founding of Albemarle Church dates to 1863, when forty-one people separated themselves for worship. Under the pastorate and leadership of the Rev. James Lewitt, the church was built and opened on 23 July 1867. Its architect was Henry Francis Lockwood of Bradford, who worked extensively for one of the church's subscribers, Titus Salt, and whose former apprentice Cuthbert Brodrick opened the Grand Hotel in the same year. When in use after consecration, a school building and caretaker's cottage were found to be needed, and were built adjacent by 1868. The church's organ, of 20 stops and 1,186 pipes, was installed in September 1870 by Booth of Wakefield for a cost of ¬£360 (). It was reported that the sound quality was affected by the sound having to emerge through the low arches on two sides due to the organ filling the whole of its square recess. By the time Lewitt retired from the ministry, the Church had grown in membership from forty-seven to 183. The following ministers were the Revs. W. H. Tetley, W. T. Adey, W. J. Parker and Robert Wood. In 1892, the membership had increased to 343. New institutions were established, the school enlarged and pew rents abolished. An incident in 1914 in which the church was struck by lightning led to the bursting of a lead gas pipe and the ignition of the gas. Albemarle Baptist Church, including the attached schoolroom, is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 12 January 1990. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to \\"buildings that are nationally important and of special interest\\". The church and Albemarle Crescent, which includes a large grass area to the church's front, are in the heart of the Scarborough Conservation area. The church has benefited from repairs made under the Scarborough Squares Partnership Grants Scheme which ran 2006-11. This included rebuilding the top five metres of the spire and rebuilding the tracery. Description The triple arched main entrance Albemarle Baptist Church Cottage The building is a classic small church of the Gothic Revival style. Constructed of dressed stone and white brick with ashlar dressings, the street front has a triple arched entrance, with circular piers and responds with foliate capitals, and polychromatic arches. The three sets of double doors have stained glass, and single shallow buttresses flank the entranceway. To its left is a single lancet window, and to its right, three. The side aisles each have four 2-light plate tracery lancets. The transepts have large single 4-light plate tracery windows. The chancel has three 2-light plate tracery windows. To the north east, the attached schoolroom has a canted south front with three 2-light plate tracery windows. Above is a large six-light pointed arch window with geometric tracery, which has to its right a triple lancet flanked by single blind lancets, topped by a quatrefoil pierced parapet. A small semi-circular apse with a row of 7 upper lancets is to the left of the main window. Above that, the square tower has a pair of lancets, then a moulded string course, a bell stage with a single lancet to each face topped by a tall crocketed gable, and a stone octagonal spire rises several further metres. Internally, slender iron columns supporting the wooden roof divide the nave and aisles. It is complete with 19th-century wooden pews, pulpit and choir stalls, and a tin-lined total immersion font. The seating can hold 800 people (as of 1890). Next to the church is a separately listed minister's cottage, also by Lockwood, in white brick and ashlar and in a similar Gothic style including a projecting gabled porch.

The instrument often accompanies dance, and may act as melody and rhythm. Name The name anandalahari means \\"waves of joy\\". Popularly this instrument is called by onomatopoeic names like gubgubi and khamak. Description The anandalahari has a barrel-shaped body, open on one side, and fixed on the \\"bottom\\" of a single string. The tool body is wooden, open on both sides; the membrane is fixed in the lower and upper parts with a leather hoop and cords. Some instruments have a hole in the upper diaphragm, others not; it may be completely absent in old instruments. The vein string is attached to the bottom with a piece of bamboo or other material. The other end of the string is fixed inside a copper pot. Use The barrel is placed in the left armpit, the pot is taken in the left hand and the string is pulled with it, and the string is played with the right hand using a plectrum. A similar instrument named pulluvan kudam is found in South India. Another similar instrument known as the gopiyantra kendra is used by the Munda people of Bengal and Odisha. Both the gopiyantra and the anandalahari are used by religious mendicant singers of the Sadhu type and especially by singers of the heterodox Baul faith.

It was released for iPad and iPhone in 2010, and for Windows Phone in 2012. The game is a prequel to the original Mirror's Edge, setting the scene about Runners and the city's shady corporations. It received very positive reviews from critics. Gameplay The player, controlling Faith Connors, jumps over an obstacle. Mirror's Edge is side-scrolling platform game where the player must control the protagonist, Faith Connors, as she navigates a city. The game acts as a prequel to the original Mirror's Edge, setting the scene about Runners and the city's shady corporations. To progress through the game, the player must complete 14 levels as fast as possible while getting past opponents controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The player has the ability to dash, jump, wall-run, slide, and use zip lines. Although Faith cannot use weapons, the player can perform melee attacks and disarm opponents. Records can be uploaded to online leaderboards, where records from other players can be downloaded as Ghosts. These are recordings that show the player the path other players took. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode, where two players may race each other across any of the game's unlocked levels. Another multiplayer mode, Rivals, involves players collecting bags under a time limit. Development and release Mirror's Edge was developed by IronMonkey Studios, a video game studio based in Melbourne, Australia. The game was originally announced on December 2, 2009, for iPhone and intended to be released in January 2010, but it was delayed so that the developers could add more content and make additional tweaks. It was later decided that the game would first be released on April 1, 2010, for the iPad's launch. An iPhone version was ultimately released on September 2, 2010. Although both versions are essentially the same game, the iPhone version does not include a multiplayer mode. Another version was released for Nokia Lumia Windows Phones on July 13, 2012. In 2015, the game was removed from the App Store because it does not support iOS versions newer than 7.1.2. Reception Mirror's Edge received very positive reviews from critics, who frequently compared it to Canabalt. IGN considered Mirror's Edge one of the best launch games for the iPad, while Eurogamer described it as a \\"beautiful 2.5D interpretation\\" of the original, praising its intuitive controls and Faith's fluid animations. Reviewing the iPhone version, Kotaku editor Luke Plunkett criticized the game's short length due to the lack of a multiplayer mode, stating that the game can be finished in half an hour, but nevertheless praised its simple and responsive controls. He also praised the graphics for their crisp and colorful textures, especially when the game is played on iPhone 4 or iPod Touch 4 devices. As of November 2010, the game has sold more than 37,000 copies.

He wrote a commentary on the East Syrian liturgy. Life Gabriel's date are uncertain, but he probably flourished in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. He refers to Shub·∏•almaran, metropolitan bishop of Karka d-Beth Slokh, who probably died in or about 620, as still alive. His commentary must precede the reforms of the liturgy associated with the patriarchate of Isho øyahb III (649‚Äì659). Sarhad Yawsip Jammo identified the author of the commentary with the Gabriel Qa·π≠raya who collated a manuscript of the Peshitta (Syriac Bible) at Nisibis in the 25th year of Khusrau II (either 614 or 615). There are references in this manuscript to the School of Nisibis and it was probably copied there. A notice says that Gabriel worked in the presence of his teacher, Mar Zakka, which implies that he was a young student at the time. Sebastian Brock rejected the identification. The manuscript is currently British Library, Add. 14471. Work Gabriel's commentary, sometimes known under the Latin title Interpretatio officiorum, survives in a single manuscript copied in the Monastery of the Bear, now catalogued as British Library, Or. 3336. Only the section on the Holy Qurbana has been published and translated into English. An epitome of the Commentary by Abraham bar Lipeh has been published. The date on the manuscript is partially damaged. It was copied on the last Friday of July in a year of the 13th century, either 1238, 1268 or 1288. The commentary is divided into five verse homilies (memre) in question-and-answer format.

Jackson and Gergely Baics. The data visualization follows the history of New York City‚Äôs infrastructure and street system development from 1609 to the present day. The video was released onto YouTube by Myles Zhang, an undergraduate in architectural history at Columbia University, on October 25, 2018. The video quickly went viral, gaining over three million views. Synopsis Through analysis of geo-referenced historic maps, this film follows the spatial history of New York City‚Äôs five boroughs from the initial Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam in the seventeenth-century, through the British colonial era, Industrial Revolution, and into the modern era. This illustrates New York City‚Äôs slow but steady growth in the pre-modern era, followed by the rapid explosion of the city‚Äôs surface area, infrastructure, and population in the twentieth-century. The resulting short film presents a sequence of ‚Äúcartographic snapshots‚Äù of the historic extent of urbanized area for every twenty to thirty years. The film ends by rewinding four centuries of urban development in a reverse time-lapse. In the final scene, a quote from E.B. White‚Äôs 1949 soliloquy to New York City flashes across the screen: ‚ÄúThe city is like poetry: it compresses all life, all races, and breeds, into a small island and adds music and the accompaniment of internal engines.‚Äù Production and release Hundreds of maps from the New York Public Library‚Äôs digital collections and the Library of Congress were analyzed for this film. The maps most representative of urban development at different intervals in urban history were then selected and incorporated into the animation. Since the source maps all had different scales and graphics, it was necessary to meticulously redraw these old maps with a consistent design. This coherence allowed the rate and trends in urban growth to be read more easily and compared between eras. In addition to winning the 2019 award for best data visualization from Columbia University‚Äôs Data Science Institute, the video is frequently used in introductory urban history courses. The animation was inspired by, or has inspired, similar urban history data visualizations for Amsterdam, London, Barcelona, and Berlin. Map selected from film that depicts NYC's population density c.1900 on a sliding scale from 1,000 to 150,000 people per square mile. Areas with less than 1,000 per square mile are excluded. Interactive Map Soundtrack The soundtrack volume rises with the pace of urban growth and has added sound effects of urban life appropriate to each time period New York City‚Äôs development traveled through. The sounds of nature, water, and machinery evoke the soundscape of each era in urban history. The music is adapted from the 2002 album, The Language of Cities, from the instrumental rock band Maserati.

Early life Van Assenburgh was the son of Pieter van Assenburgh and his wife, Susanna Houwens and was baptized on 23 December 1657 in the Westerkerk, Amsterdam. Before he joined the VOC, Van Assenburgh served under the 'Kaiser of the Donou'. Career Van Assenbugh was appointed as successor to Governor W. A. van der Stel and he left the Netherlands on 19 May 1707. As the ship sailed via Brazil, he only reached the Cape only 25 January 1708 and on the 1st of February he was introduced to the inhabitants of Cape by the secunde and acting governor, Johan Cornelis d'Ableing. At the beginning of his term as Governor, Van Assenburgh had the difficult task at appease the anger of the dissatisfied burghers caused by the revolt and dismissal of W. A. van der Stel and he had to ensure that the people adhere to the commands of the Lords XVII (Heren XVII). Among other things, he dealt with disputes between burghers and officials, stopped smuggling, introduced new licensing conditions for auctions and made improvements in the care of the sick. The people of the Cape were generally satisfied with his actions. However, the former Governor-General, Joan van Hoorn, who visited the Cape in 1710, criticized Van Assenburgh's rule in a letter addressed to his father-in-law, Abraham van Riebeeck. Van Hoorn accused Van Assenburgh, who was unmarried, of consorting with women of ill repute, being fond of frivolous entertainments and that the Cape had a general air of neglect. Although Van Assenburgh was accused of indecisive and improper conduct, it was because of his efforts that the Cape burghers became reconciled once again to the authority of the VOC. Death Van Assenburgh was bed-ridden for eight months before his death. He signed his last will and testament exactly a month before he died on 27 December 1711.

California is one of only a few states which became a state without first being an organized territory. Name An Act for the Admission of the State of California into the Union is the formal title given to the Congressional legislation passed by the 31st Congress, and signed by President Millard Fillmore on September 9, 1850, which admitted California as the 31st state to the Union. Per the terms of the Compromise of 1850, California was admitted as a free state. The Act may informally be referred to as the California Statehood Act or the California Admission Act. Background=Start of the Mexican American War and the Bear Flag Revolt Todd's original Bear Flag, photographed in 1890 The United States declared war on Mexico on May 13, 1846. After receiving word of the declaration of war, a force consisting mostly of American settlers in California, staged a revolt on June 15, 1846 against Mexican authorities which became known at the Bear Flag Revolt. They overwhelmed and captured the small Mexican garrison at Sonoma and declared the California Republic (Spanish: La Rep√∫blica de California), or Bear Flag Republic, raising the original Bear State flag over the captured garrison. Their control was largely restricted to the area around Sonoma California and lasted for 25 days. On July 5, 1846, Brevet Captain John C. Fr√©mont assumed control of the republic's forces and integrated into his California Battalion. On July 9, 1846, Navy Lieutenant Joseph Warren Revere arrived in Sonoma and replaced the Bear Flag with the flag of the United States, formally declaring the United States possession of California. End of the Mexican American War The Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. In the treaty, Mexico ceded a large portion of northern Mexico in what is now the southwestern United States. With the acquisition of this large territory, Congress began debating how to organize it. Initially, there was no cause to rush the organization, as the territory was sparsely populated. However, with the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in California, a large migration of Americans began, as well as an influx of new immigrants from Europe and Asia, seeking to either find gold or provide goods and services to those seeking gold. This migration gave rise to the immediate necessity of organizing the territory to provide services such as recording land deeds and claims, providing court services and law enforcement, and organizing local governments. Admission debate The issue of the expansion or restriction of slavery was a fundamental dispute in the admission of new states to the Union since before the passage of the Missouri Compromise in 1820. The size of the California territory, its natural resources, access to the Pacific as well as the speed at which the territory was expanding its population added a special urgency to organizing and admitting California into the Union. Some feared that if the United States did not act swiftly an independence movement could erupt that might sever California from the United States. A fierce debate raged over the status of California and the other territories ceded to the U.S. by Mexico for most of the 31st Congress. General Zachary Taylor, a hero of, but also a staunch opponent of the Mexican War, had become President in 1848. Although Taylor was a southern slaveowner, he believed that slavery was economically unfeasible in the acquired territories and therefore opposed the expansion of slavery as pointless and controversial, which became a serious obstacle impeding agreement in Congress on a solution to the territorial issue. In Taylor's 1849 State of the Union message to Congress, he commented extensively on the issue of California, stating in part, > Zachary Taylor (1849) The extension of the coast of the United States on the > Pacific and the unexampled rapidity with which the inhabitants of California > especially are increasing in numbers have imparted new consequence to our > relations with the other countries whose territories border upon that ocean. > It is probable that the intercourse between those countries and our > possessions in that quarter, particularly with the Republic of Chili, will > become extensive and mutually advantageous in proportion as California and > Oregon shall increase in population and wealth. ‚Ä¶ No civil government having > been provided by Congress for California, the people of that Territory, > impelled by the necessities of their political condition, recently met in > convention for the purpose of forming a constitution and State government, > which the latest advices give me reason to suppose has been accomplished; > and it is believed they will shortly apply for the admission of California > into the Union as a sovereign State. Should such be the case, and should > their constitution be conformable to the requisitions of the Constitution of > the United States, I recommend their application to the favorable > consideration of Congress. The California Constitution, which had been adopted on November 13, 1849, and proposition to admit California as a new state was submitted to Congress for debate President Zachary Taylor on February 13, 1850. With the unexpected death of Taylor on July 9, 1850, Vice President Millard Fillmore became President. Although Fillmore was a northerner and not a slave holder, he had strong ties to the South and was much more open to a compromise that would allow the extension of slavery into the territories. This change of leadership opened the door for the passage of the Compromise of 1850, crafted by Henry Clay. The compromise allowed the admission of California into the Union without Congress imposing any limitation on the introduction of slavery. However, the Constitution adopted by the California Constitutional Convention in October 1849 in preparation for admission into the Union specifically prohibited slavery in the new state. This compromise was offset by concessions to slave states, including the possible extension of slavery into other territories ceded from Mexico and the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 which stripped the free states of much of their ability to legally protect blacks who were suspected of fleeing slavery from kidnapping by slave catchers and forcible removal to the South. Texts Henry Clay The Clay Resolutions On January 29, 1850, Senator Henry Clay proposed eight resolutions to end the heated debate over the status of the territories acquired from Mexico. Congress adopted Clay's eight resolutions, collectively known as the Clay Resolutions which prepared the way for the passage of the five acts making up the Compromise of 1850. The first resolution concerned the admission of California and reads as follows: > Resolved, That California, with suitable boundaries, ought, upon her > application to be admitted as one of the States of this Union, without the > imposition by Congress of any restriction in respect to the exclusion or > introduction of slavery within those boundaries. Text of the Admission Act The California Admissions Act was the second act of the Compromise of 1850 to be passed by Congress. The text of the act contains three sections and enacts five main provisions: # The admission of California as a full and equal state in the union (Section One). # Grants California two seats in the House of Representatives until the next Congressional reapportionment (Section Two). # Places the land in California into the federal public domain under the sole authority of Congress and outside the authority of California to tax or lay assessments (Section Three). # Stipulates that waterways in California shall be open to free navigation by all citizens of the United States without the imposition of taxes, duties or fees for usage (Section Three). # Declares none of the provisions in the act of admission are to be construed as endorsing or rejecting any provision in the Constitution of California (Section Three). The final provision in section three was intended as a declaration that Congress took no position on the provisions against slavery contained in the California constitution. The text of An Act For The Admission Of The State Of California Into The Union reads as follows: > Preamble Whereas the people of California have presented a constitution and > asked admission into the Union, which constitution was submitted to Congress > by the president of the United States, by message dated February thirteenth, > eighteen hundred and fifty, and which, on due examination, is found to be > republican in its form of government: Section 1 Be it enacted by the Senate > and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress > assembled, that the state of California shall be one, and is hereby declared > to be one, of the United States of America, and admitted into the Union on > an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever. Section > 2 And be it further enacted, that, until the representatives in Congress > shall be apportioned according to an actual enumeration of the inhabitants > of the United States, the state of California shall be entitled to two > representatives in Congress. Section 3 And be it further enacted, that the > said state of California is admitted into the Union upon the express > condition that the people of said state, through their legislature or > otherwise, shall never interfere with the primary disposal of the public > lands within its limits, and shall pass no law and do no act whereby the > title of the United States to, and right to dispose of, the same shall be > impaired or questioned; and that they shall never lay any tax or assessment > of any description whatsoever upon the public domain of the United States, > and in no case shall nonresident proprietors, who are citizens of the United > States, be taxed higher than residents; and that all the navigable waters > within the said state shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to > the inhabitants of said state as to the citizens of the United States, > without any tax, impost, or duty therefore: provided, that nothing herein > contained shall be construed as recognizing or rejecting the propositions > tendered by the people of California as articles of compact in the ordinance > adopted by the convention which formed the constitution of that state. > Approved, September 9, 1850. Admission With the signing of the Compromise of 1850, California was formally admitted to the Union as the 31st state in the Union on September 9, 1850. The United States House of Representatives approved the bill on September 7, 1850 by a vote of 150 to 56. The United States Senate under the careful leadership of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster had previously voted on January 17, 1850 to admit California into the Union by a vote of 48 to 3 and they concurred with the House vote on September 7, 1850. The territory legislature first met as what would become the legislature of the State of California after admission on December 15, 1849 at the first state capital at San Jose, California. The first American governor of California was Peter Hardeman Burnett, who was elected as the first civilian governor prior to statehood on December 20, 1849 and continued in the position until January 9, 1851. The first two members from California to the United States Senate were San Franciscans John C. Fremont and William M. Gwin, both of whom were members of the Democratic Party and took their oaths of office on September 10, 1850. On September 11, 1850, Edward Gilbert (Democrat) and George W. Wright (Independent) took their oaths of office to become the state‚Äôs two Representatives. California Admission Day California Admission Day is a legal holiday in the state of California in the United States. It is celebrated as a day of observance annually on September 9 to commemorate the anniversary of the 1850 admission of California into the Union as the thirty- first state.

Background Jostyn described Blue Stories as \\"an album of songs about people and their plights\\", adding that \\"I've tried to treat these people compassionately. I'd prefer the CD not be an experience in darkness - rather, one in a semi-pale shade of blue. Twilight blue, say, with a smattering of stars.\\" Both \\"Don't Turn Away\\" and \\"East of Eden\\" feature Carly Simon on backing vocals, synth and percussion. The album also includes a cover of Simon's 1971 hit \\"That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\\", which features lyrics by Jacob Brackman, whom Jostyn later married. Jostyn described the song as a \\"despairing view of marriage\\". \\"Rock City Road\\" features harmonica which Jostyn considered to be \\"train-style harmonica a la Sonny Terry\\". Critical reception Scott Alarik of The Boston Globe described Blue Stories as \\"a soft thrill of a CD\\". He added: \\"In a voice sparkling with wit and personality, Jostyn sings songs of loss and healing, all delivered with the eloquence that made her a favorite accompanist for Carly Simon, Billy Joel and John Mellencamp. Seth Rogovoy of The Berkshire Eagle wrote: \\"The album's folk-pop tunes have a strong Anglo- Irish folk influence, and the music veers towards barrel-house jazz on 'Empathetic Woman'.\\" Jay Miller of The Patriot Ledger praised Jostyn's lyrics on the album, which he found to be \\"witty commentary, incisive self- examination and moving depictions of the simple truths in life\\". C. Michael Bailey of All About Jazz described Blue Stories as \\"an exceptional solution of folk, blues, Dixieland, pop, rock, Celtic and country, all simmering into a truly distinctive sound\\".

She is known for analysing the media coverage of the Alc√†sser Case as a reaction to feminist activity in Spain in early 1990s, arguing that it responded to recent gains of the feminist movement by portraying them as inherently connected to violence against women. Life and career Barjola studied Political Science and Administrative Studies at the University of the Basque Country. She then pursued equity studies at the National University of Distance Education. She obtained a doctorate in Feminist and Gender Studies at the University of the Basque Country in 2014, with a thesis entitled Las representaciones del peligro sexual y su influencia en las pr√°cticas de las mujeres a partir del crimen sexual de Alc√°sser (1992) (The representations of sexual danger and its influence on the practices of women from the sexual crime of Alc√°sser, 1992). Barjola's doctoral thesis re-examined the Alc√†sser Case, which was the sensational murder of three young women in 1992 that made a substantial impact on Spanish popular culture, from the perspective of Spanish feminist activity in the 1990s. Specifically, she argued that the sensationalism of the murders, and the way that they were portrayed in mass media, served as a reaction against the burgeoning feminist movement of 1990s Spain, providing a rationale for pushback against the increasing prominence of women in Spanish public life. In 2018, she continued this line of research in her book Microf√≠sica sexista del poder. El caso Alc√†sser y la construcci√≥n del terror sexual (Sexist microphysics of power: The Alc√†sser case and the construction of sexual terror). In Microf√≠sica sexista del poder, Barjola casts prominent coverage of the Alc√†sser Case as an example of victim blaming, in which the fact that the three victims were out late partying was treated as an explanation for their murder, and the lucky decision of a fourth woman to stay home was used as a moral tale to discourage women's freedom. She argues that the sensational coverage of the murders affected the attitudes and behaviours of a generation of Spanish women, by portraying sexual terror as a logical consequence of the advances of the Spanish feminist movement in areas like freedom of movement and bodily autonomy. More broadly, Barjola has argued that a certain amount of sexual violence is explicitly permitted in the political system, because it serves a purpose for scaring away challenges to the structure of society.

In June of 1917, G. M. Semyonov was commissioned by the Russian War Commission to form a standing army, composed of Kazak, Mongol, and Buryat horseback forces. However, his work was interrupted by the regime change following the October Revolution. Following the October Revolution, and after receiving further authorization from the Petrograd Council of Work and Soldier Deputies, Semyonov continued assembling his troops. Contrary to his orders he accepted Russians into his ranks, conditional upon their denunciation of \\"revolutionism\\". As word reached the Petrograd Council that Semyonov was assembling Anti-Revolutionary forces they withheld money promised for the compensation of his army. On 18 November 1917, Semyonov began an anti-Soviet revolt, seizing control of the lower Berezovka train station. Then, attending a city council in nearby Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude), he called citizens to overturn the local government and engage in a \\"merciless war against Bolshivism\\". The council responded by authorizing the police force (lit. \\"General Safety Commission\\") and forces of the oblast council to arrest Captain Semyonov and disarm his regiment. Semyonov resisted by force, in turn traveling to Chita where he arrested Pumpyansky, the head of the Chitian Ruling Council. He also appropriated funds for his army before fleeing to Manzhouli. With support from other local forces, and General D. L. Horvata, the managing officer of the Chinese-East Railroad (China East Iron Road, or \\"–ö–í–ñ–î\\") Semyonov formed the Manzhouli Standing Army, composed of around 500 men on horseback. They continued to raid railway stations and incite rebellion. Eventually the Soviet Army was forced to dispatch a large military force to restore control in the region. These forces were led by Sergei Lazo, from the Central Siberian Council. Their battles with Semyonov's army constituted one of the first fronts of the Civil War in the Far East. Semyonov was considered a candidate for assistance from several foreign governments with interests running counter to the USSR, including the United States. Although Semyonov received support from the Japanese and was initially successful at holding the city of Chita, his forces did eventually suffer defeat.

Melee player. , he is ranked as the fourth best Melee player in the world, and has finished in the top ten of formal rankings presented by Red Bull every year since 2016. Notable major tournament results include first place at Smash Summit 8, second place at Genesis 6, and fourth place at Evo 2014. Axe has primarily competed using Pikachu, and is considered to be the best Pikachu player in the world. He has been noted for his fast- paced style of play and his ability to achieve tournament success with the character. He has been sponsored by Tempo Storm since 2015.  Career = Early career and sponsorship  Axe competed in his first Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament at his high school when he was fifteen years old. He formally became involved with competitive Super Smash Bros. after he started attending local tournaments in 2007, taking inspiration for his handle from the Axe product brand. By the end of the year, he became one of the top ten Melee players in the rankings for his home state of Arizona. He began competing at national tournaments after attending Genesis in 2009, and was ranked as the best player in his state's rankings in 2010. After defeating several high- ranked players at Apex 2010, he began to solidify his status as a top player through high placements at major tournaments. In 2014, Axe tied for 5th place at MLG Anaheim after defeating top player Juan \\"Hungrybox\\" DeBiedma. In July, he signed a sponsorship deal with esports team Mortality eSports, and quit his job later that year to fully dedicate his time to professional competition. He has also been affiliated with esports team Most Valuable Gaming. Representing Mortality eSports, Axe tied for 5th place at Evo 2014, but departed from the team after six months. In April 2015, he attended MVG Sandstorm, a national tournament, where he placed in third after defeating top players William \\"Leffen\\" Hjelte and Joseph \\"Mang0\\" Marquez. In July, he was signed by multi- esports organization Tempo Storm alongside fellow Melee professional Weston \\"Westballz\\" Dennis. Later that month, he tied for 7th place at Evo 2015.  Formal ranking and continued success  Axe attended Genesis 3 in January 2016, and took 4th place after defeating top players Mang0 and Zachary \\"SFAT\\" Cordoni. Subsequently, he placed in at least 6th place at EGLX 2016, CEO 2016, and Super Smash Con 2016. For his overall performance through 2016, he was ranked as the ninth best Melee player by SSBMRank, a biannual power ranking presented by Red Bull. Axe began 2017 with a 7th-place finish at Genesis 4, and continued to attend many major tournaments through the first half of the year. He was one of sixteen top Melee players invited to Smash Summit Spring 2017 in March, where he placed in 5th. He subsequently took 3rd place at CEO 2017, and then tied for 9th place at Evo 2017 after losing to Adam \\"Armada\\" Lindgren. Tournament performances in the second half of the year included 4th place at DreamHack Atlanta 2017, 3rd place at DreamHack Denver 2017, and 5th place at Smash Summit 5, with the latter two performances including victories against Jason \\"Mew2King\\" Zimmerman. Axe was ranked as the seventh best player in 2017 by SSBMRank. The first major Melee tournament of 2018 was Genesis 5, where Axe tied for 7th place. Subsequent performances included a 9th-place finish at EGLX 2018, 2nd place at Flatiron 3, and 3rd place at Get On My Level 2018, defeating Leffen and Mew2King at the latter two tournaments, respectively. The latter portion of the year included a victory at Runback 2018, a local Arizona tournament, as well as a 5th-place finish at Smash Summit 7, a major tournament. Panda Global Rankings, a biannual power ranking that superseded SSBMRank, ranked Axe as the tenth best Melee player in 2018. Axe took 2nd place at the first two major tournaments of 2019, Genesis 6 and Get On My Level 2019, after losing to Hungrybox in the finals of both tournaments. Later that year he won Smash Summit 8 after defeating Justin \\"Wizzrobe\\" Hallett in the finals. With this victory, he became the first player to win a major Melee tournament using Pikachu, a character often described as being in the \\"mid-tier\\" of the game's roster of characters in terms of fighting ability. Axe was ranked as the fourth best player in the Panda Global Rankings for his performance in 2019. Before the Panda Global Rankings suspended the 2020 competitive season amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Axe attended Smash Summit 9 in February. He tied for 5th place at the tournament, after losing to Mang0 in the quarterfinals.  Style of play  Axe mainly competes using Pikachu, and is considered to be the best Pikachu player in the world. In a 2016 interview, Axe stated that he chose to use the character in Melee after originally playing the character in Super Smash Bros., the first installment in the Super Smash Bros. series. His style of play has been noted for its complexity and speed, incorporating \\"tricky movement options\\" as well as \\"lightning-quick movement\\" that allows him to anticipate his opponent's attacks and swiftly retaliate against them.  Personal life  Axe was born on April 7, 1991 in Germany to parents in the US military, although he was raised in Sierra Vista, Arizona, United States. He has two older siblings.

It was located at the head of the valley of Cwm Rhwyddfor (or Cwm Rhwyddor) on the pass called Bwlch Llyn Bach between Minffordd and Cross Foxes; Llyn y Tri Greyenyn is the 'llyn bach‚Äô‚Äô (‚Äòlittle lake‚Äô) in the pass‚Äôs name. Most of the lake has now been infilled in order to improve the road (which formerly skirted the lake). Today, the A487 passes through the site. There is also a small car park on the location of part of the lake (on the northwest side of the road). Some of the remains of the old lake can be seen on the south-east side. As the car park is a convenient place to watch military aircraft on the so-called 'Mach Loop‚Äô, the car park is sometimes called the ‚ÄòMach Loop' car park.Gareth Wyn Williams, 'Police warning: Vehicles at Mach Loop and Snowdonia will be towed', Cambrian News, 23 July 2020; accessed 17 August 2020. Names and Traditions One of the earliest references to the lake dates from around 1700 when Edward Lhuyd sent a questionnaire to every parish in Wales to inquire about geographical features, place names, local traditions and the like (his ‚ÄòParochialia‚Äô). The reply from Tal-y-llyn includes the following: > Lhyn pen Morva als [alias] Lhyn y tri Grayenyn ym mlaen K. Rhwydhor ar > dervun pl. Dol Gelhey.R. H. Morris (ed.), Parochialia being a summary of > answers to 'Parochial queries in order to a geographical dictionary, etc., > of Wales', Archaeologia Cambrensis supplement (1909), p. 6. (‚ÄòLlyn Pen Morfa alias Llyn y Tri Greyenyn at the head of Cwm Rhwyddfor on the border of the parish of Dolgellau.‚Äô) The name of the lake is associated with a legend of Idris Gawr. Idris was said to have noticed three little stones or pebbles in his shoe. He removed his shoe and threw them away. But as Idris was a giant of enormous proportions, the three little stones were themselves the size of huge boulders. The three stones landed near the lake thus explaining the name. At least one of these stones is visible today on the side of the A487. A version of the tale is recorded by Thomas Pennant in the second volume of his work A Tour of Wales (1781): > On the left, is the rugged height of Cader Idris, pass near a small lake > called, Llyn y tri Graienyn, or of the three grains; which are three vast > rocks, the ruins of the neighbouring mountain, which sometime or other had > fallen into the water. These, say the peasants, were the three grains which > had fallen into the shoe of the great Idris, which he threw out here, as > soon as he felt them hurting his foot.Thomas Pennant, The Journey to Snowdon > (London, 1781), p. 96. A tradition about how the lake was filled is mentioned by Lewis Morris in a poem that describes his journey from Ceredigion in 1750 to visit William Vaughan of Nannau. He says that the lake ‚Äì if the tale is true‚Äì was filled by the urine of a giantess or witch: > Galw ym Minffordd yn frau > i olchi trwm feddyliau > yfodd y tafarnwr y gorau > rhoes y gwaetha i ninnau > oddiyno dan graig ddibyn > trwy fwlch y tri graienyn > a rhyfedd Iawn (os gwir hyn) > lle pisodd gwiddon lonaid llynHuw Owen (ed.), The Additional Letters of the > Morrises of Anglesey (1735-1786), Y Cymmrodor, vol.

The community is located less than northeast of Laplace and north of Montz. Schl√∂sser The community of Frenier was once known as Schl√∂sser. Named after Martin Schl√∂sser, an early German immigrant. Martin and his brother Adam began clearing out the forests and harvesting the local timber. Over the years more German settlers arrived and the village of Schl√∂sser grew to over twenty-five families. With fierce competition in the timber industry the Schl√∂sser brothers quit the business and converted to farming. Cabbage grew very well in the Louisiana soil and the brothers began exporting sauerkraut to New Orleans. Then in 1854 the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad built a line through the area. During this time the fare for a train ride was only three cents per mile. Sauerkraut was exported up to Chicago, Illinois. Because the rail service to Chicago was only 40 hours, the sauerkraut export became very lucrative. For several decades the export of Frenier sauerkraut to the French Market and Chicago served as the main source of income for these families. Destruction On September 29, 1915 the New Orleans Hurricane of 1915 destroyed the community of Frenier. Some of the locals sought refuge in the railroad depot, which collapsed during the hurricane and killed the 25 people hiding inside. In the aftermath it was determined that the hurricane killed 275 people and caused an estimated dollars in damage. Legend of Julia Brown Some of the surviving locals began telling stories of a voodoo priestess named Julia Brown that predicted the event. According to local historians the town of Frenier had no doctors and Julia Brown likely served as the local healer. A few months before she died she began repeating the phrase \\"One day I'm gonna die, and I'm gonna take all of you with me\\". Survivers said that a few weeks before the hurricane arrived she began sitting on her front porch rocking back and forth while playing her guitar and singing: According to the legend on September 29, 1915 Julia Brown died and most of the population gathered to bury the voodoo priestess. During the funeral at around four o'clock the hurricane arrived and completely destroyed the town.

The novel, Oyeyemi's third, won a 2010 Somerset Maugham Award. Combining elements of ghost, vampire, and haunted house stories, White Is for Witching concerns a twin named Miranda and her relationship with the sentient, xenophobic house she inhabits. The New York Times compared the novel to Toni Morrison's Beloved and Chris Abani's Song for the Night.  Plot = Prologue  The novel begins with several cryptic pages in which questions are asked of three entities: a woman named Ore, a man named Eliot, and the Silver House at 29 Barton Road. Each answers the question, \\"Where is Miranda Silver?\\" Ore answers that Miranda is in the ground below the Silver House, her throat blocked by a chunk of apple. Eliot answers that Miranda has been missing for six months. The Silver House answers that Miranda is at home, \\"homesick, home sick.\\"  Part One: Curioser  Twins Miranda and Eliot Silver and their parents, Lily Silver and Luc Dufresne, run a bed-and-breakfast out of Lily's childhood home, 29 Barton Road in Dover. When the twins are sixteen and a half, Lily Silver is killed while on assignment as a photojournalist in Haiti. Miranda, who has a pre-existing pica eating disorder, descends into depression and ultimately suffers a mental break that results in a five-month clinic stay. The Silver House shows malevolent, xenophobic tendencies connected to the maternal line of the Silver women (Lily, Lily's mother Jennifer, and Jennifer's mother Anna). It attacks guests, and the Kurdish housekeeper, her husband, and their two daughters move out after the house traps their eldest daughter in the elevator. Meanwhile Miranda continues to lose weight due to her eating disorder and begins to show characteristics (appearances, behaviors, idiolects) of the deceased women from her maternal line, to the extent that her own twin mistakes her for their mother. When her father asks Miranda her birth year, Miranda can't remember. The Silver House reveals that Anna Good (Miranda's great-grandmother) was the one to bring it to life with a curse after her husband died in Africa in WWII, fighting the Germans. Luc hires a new housekeeper, a Yoruba woman named Sade who practices Juju witchcraft and makes protective objects after arriving, presumably to protect herself from the House's hostility. While the other members of the household are out, the house attacks Sade by possessing a mannequin. The House states that Jennifer Silver (Lily's mother) didn't run away as the family believed; because Jennifer was planning to abandon Lily, the House trapped her inside its walls where she lived out the rest of her life. The House adds, \\"Believe it, don't believe it, as you will\\" and proposes that instead Anna caught Jennifer running away and strangled her to death.  Part Two: And Curioser  Miranda heads to Cambridge alone, where she begins a romantic relationship with a girl named Ore, who is of Nigerian descent. The narration moves to Ore's perspective and explores her experience in Cambridge's white-dominated society. Ore often references the Caribbean folk story of the soucouyant, who is an old woman that abandons her skin at night to feed on the souls of others. In the story, the soucouyant is defeated when a girl rubs its abandoned skin with salt and pepper, preventing the soucouyant from re-entering. Ore sees a photo of long-haired Miranda pre-breakdown but can't believe it's her, because Miranda has now almost completely taken on the appearances of Lily, Jennifer, and Anna. Shortly before the Christmas break, Miranda tries to jump out of Ore's fourth-floor window, saying that the Silver House is calling her, but Ore manages to pull her back. When Miranda returns home, now so weak she has difficulty walking and seeing, she invites Ore to stay with her. Ore accepts, though she's been warned about Dover's reputation for xenophobia. The Silver House and its ghosts are enraged that Miranda has fallen in love with a black woman, and turn their violent tendencies against her and Ore. When Ore arrives, the house attacks her repeatedly. Sade tells her that the house is a monster and gives her salt and chili peppers for protection. After the house attacks Ore again in the night, she decides to leave. As she tries to leave, Ore has a series of hallucinatory encounters with the House: She encounters a little girl in the elevator, holding something bloody and covered in flies. She rubs her hands in salt and tears at this girl's face, revealing Miranda, who attacks her. Ore manages to hold her by the throat until the elevator stops at a new floor, filled with silent white figures, which Ore blinds with salt. She splits Miranda's skin open \\"like a bad nut\\" and it falls off, revealing the long-haired girl from the photo‚ÄîMiranda before her breakdown. This Miranda desperately tries to climb back into the skin, while Ore manages to escape the house (with help from Sade) and goes home. After Ore leaves, Miranda steels herself to fight the Silver House and its ghosts, deciding that she can't be \\"herself plus all her mothers.\\" On her return, someone has heaped all-season apples in the kitchen. Miranda swallows two watch batteries (the ingestion of which can cause death). Eliot has made her a pie from the all-season apples (which the Silver House produces), but Miranda refuses to eat it, thinking he is trying to poison her. She runs downstairs barefoot, which is the last anyone sees of her. The novel ends where it began. Miranda has been missing for six months, since the apple pie incident. The bed-and-breakfast has been closed, but Eliot sometimes notices that furniture has been moved. Miranda's old shoes continually fill with a thick red liquid that smells like roses. Eliot thinks he hears Miranda's footsteps in the attic of the Silver House.  Characters  * Miranda Silver (Miri): Miranda, the novel's protagonist, is a young woman with a hereditary pica eating disorder, who uncontrollably consumes chalk. Throughout the novel she takes on more and more characteristics of the maternal Silver line. * Eliot Silver: Eliot is Miranda's twin brother. He is one of the first-person narrators. * 29 Barton Road (The Silver House): The Silver House in Dover, currently a bed-and-breakfast, is another of the first- person narrators. The Silver House is possessed by Miranda's deceased maternal ancestors, Lily, Jennifer, and Anna. It shows xenophobic and racist tendencies, often attacking the immigrants and people of color who stay or live there. * Ore Lind: Ore is Miranda's love interest and one of the few characters that sees the house for what it is. She is the final first-person narrator. She is the daughter of a Nigerian immigrant and was adopted as a baby by white British parents. * Luc Dufresne: Luc Dufresne is the father of Miranda and Eliot. Luc runs the Silver House as a bed-and-breakfast. Luc is a good cook and is constantly trying to concoct dishes that will be appetizing to Miranda. * Lily Silver: Lily Silver is a photojournalist, and Miranda and Eliot's mother. She is shot and killed in Haiti while on assignment at the beginning of the novel. * Jennifer Silver: Lily's mother. She ostensibly ran off after having Lily, leaving her own mother Anna to raise Lily, but the House claims to have trapped her inside its walls, where Jennifer lived a long but \\"unconventional\\" life until 1993‚Äîthough the House also raises the possibility that Anna strangled Jennifer to death when she caught Jennifer running away. * Anna Silver (n√©e Anna Good): Also referred to as GrandAnna. Anna raised Lily after Jennifer Silver's disappearance. The House credits her with bringing it to life through a curse, and she seems to be the source of its violent xenophobic tendencies. * Sade: Sade is the housekeeper of the Silver House, a Yoruba woman versed in juju. She has tribal scars on her cheeks. Sade is the only character to battle successfully with the Silver House.  Narration  Point of view within the novel is complex and unconventional, with one of the first-person narrators being the Silver House itself. The perspective shifts between first-person and third-person sections; first-person sections are narrated by Eliot, Ore, and the Silver House, while the third-person sections are limited to Miranda's perspective. All of the first-person narrators are unreliable, and the third-person narrator cleaves so closely to Miranda's perspective as to reflect her biases and hallucinations.  Reception  White Is for Witching received mixed reviews but won a 2010 Somerset Maugham Award. The New York Times called the novel \\"a delightfully unconventional coming-of-age story\\" but added that the story \\"is suffering ever so slightly under the weight of a political agenda.\\" The Guardian was critical, calling it \\"a ghost story without much of a ghost, or a story.\\" Writing in Callaloo, Aspasia Stephanou praised White Is for Witching for subverting \\"the conventional and metaphorical associations of vampirism with the ‚Äúforeign‚Äù other, as the British Nigerian Ore draws upon her knowledge of the soucouyant in order to try to understand and explain the dangerous matriarchal line of Miranda Silver‚Äôs British ancestors. White is established as the marker of evil, a whiteness that embodies British nationalism.\\"  References  Category:2009 books Category:Supernatural books ","title":"White Is for Witching"},{"id":"64964648","text":"The Moc√≠mboa da Praia offensive was a six day long offensive in northern Mozambique by Islamic State's Central African Province (ISCAP) to capture the town of 30,000.

Timeline The offensive actions started on August 5, 2020 when ISCAP insurgents attacked the villages of Anga, 1 de Maio, Awasse, and the outskirts of Moc√≠mboa da Praia on the same night. On August 6, ISCAP attacked two military bases in Moc√≠mboa da Praia, killing or wounding 50 soldiers and seizing dozens of rifles and RPG-7s.

On August 9, ISCAP took the town of Awasse and were in control of the outskirts of Moc√≠mboa da Praia. A well- carried out ambush took place on Sunday just before Awasse, killing 55 recruits and injuring 90 more. By the 10th the city of Moc√≠mboa da Praia was completely cut off from food and ammunition. South Africa's Dyck Advisory Group attempted to air drop ammunition onto the city under siege, but dropped it too far from the Mozambican military. As a result, the Mozambicans suffered casualties trying to recover the supplies. On Tuesday, August 11, the Mozambican army, outnumbered and low on ammunition, was forced to retreat by boat from the city. In the retreat, an HV32 interceptor vessel was hit with an RPG and sank. 55 soldiers were killed in running battles during the siege of the city.

According to a grand jury indictment, the officers pulled Robinson out of a car, threw him headfirst into the pavement, and struck and kicked him multiple times in the head and chest. Robinson was treated at the scene but within hours lost consciousness and later died at a hospital. The state coroner ruled the death a homicide. After an internal Jackson Police Department investigation cleared the officers of wrongdoing, one of the officers continued working for the Jackson Police Department, and the other two were hired by a police department in a nearby town. Following the George Floyd protests a year later, all three officers were indicted for second-degree murder on August 5, 2020.  People involved  George Robinson was a 62-year- old black man. Desmond Barney, 31 years old as of August 2020, Lincoln Lampley, 33, and Anthony Fox, 35, also black, were officers in the Jackson Police Department's K-9 unit at the time of the killing. As of August 2020, Lampley is still an officer with the Jackson Police Department, and Barney and Fox are police officers in nearby Clinton, Mississippi.  Death  According to prosecutors, on January 13, 2019, Barney, Lampley, and Fox were canvassing in a predominantly black neighborhood in Jackson, Mississippi, looking for suspects in the fatal robbery of a pastor hours earlier. The officers saw Robinson sitting in his car in front of his house and approached him because they thought they had seen him dealing drugs earlier. They ordered him to exit his vehicle, but Robinson, a stroke victim, was slow to comply. According to the indictment, the officers pulled Robinson from his car, threw him headfirst onto the pavement, and struck and kicked him multiple times in the head and chest. The responding ambulance treated Robinson at the scene and released him. The officers arrested Robinson on misdemeanor charges of failing to obey a police officer and resisting arrest before releasing him with instructions to appear at a future court date. Within hours, Robinson's girlfriend saw him losing consciousness and called for another ambulance. Robinson died at a hospital on January 15. The state coroner ruled the death a homicide. The coroner's report and other medical reports stated that Robinson died from blunt force trauma to the head and bleeding from the brain, and that he had several broken ribs. Two other men were later arrested for the pastor's murder.  Prosecution  The three officers were placed on paid administrative leave while the Jackson Police Department's internal affairs division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated, and were later reinstated. After the Jackson Police Department's internal affairs division cleared the officers of wrongdoing and \\"multiple agencies looked into the incident and advised that no criminal conduct occurred\\", Barney and Fox were hired by the police department of nearby Clinton, Mississippi, according to Clinton's mayor. Lampley continued to be employed by the Jackson Police Department. On August 5, 2020, all three officers were indicted for second- degree murder. The three officers posted bond and were freed pending trial. Lampley was placed on desk duty by the Jackson Police Department, and Barney and Fox were \\"assigned other duties\\" at the Clinton Police Department. Robinson's family has filed a civil suit against the city, the three police officers, and the ambulance company that treated Robinson at the scene and released him.  Impact  A march was held shortly after Robinson's death. According to The New York Times, the officers were charged \\"amid intense scrutiny of police brutality after the killing in May of George Floyd in the custody of the Minneapolis police\\". United Press International reported, \\"The indictment comes as police departments across the country consider reforms in policing in the wake of protests against excessive force and racial bias.\\"  See also  * Lists of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States  References  Further reading   * * Category:2019 controversies in the United States Category:2019 in Mississippi Category:African-American-related controversies Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Deaths in police custody in the United States Category:January 2019 events in the United States Category:Law enforcement controversies in the United States Category:Law enforcement in Mississippi Category:Jackson, Mississippi ","title":"Killing of George Robinson"},{"id":"64964773","text":"Voice is a 1971 composition for solo flute by T≈çru Takemitsu.

He was assigned for his internship to Baseka Bongwalanga Territory in Lulonga District, √âquateur Province. In August 1931 he was appointed head of the Ekota Bosaka Territory in √âquateur District. In June 1932 he transferred to the Bakutu Bosaka Territory in Tshuapa District. He left Boma on leave on 6 October 1933, and returned on 23 March 1934. His second term was spent in the territories of Ekota Bakutu and Boende in Tshuapa District.

In addition to his functions as territorial administrator he was deputy judge of the district court and auxiliary judge at the Court of First Instance in Coquilhatville. During World War II (1939‚Äì1945) Belgium was invaded on 10 May 1940.

On 20 June 1959 the journal KASAI published a letter from chief Kalamba Mangole Sylvestre and Barth√©lemy Mukenge, president of the Lulua‚ÄìFr√®res association. It called on the Belgian government to unite the Lulua in a single kingdom under one chief, and to recognise the property rights of land belonging to the Lulua. It also stated that the Baluba should recognize Lulua rights and submit to Lulua customary authority, or else return to their original lands. At De Jaegher's request the assistant district commissioner M.A. Dequenne, the first burgomaster M.

He served as the commanding officer of 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines during the battle of Iwo Jima, leading his battalion in capturing Mount Suribachi which later led to the flag being raised over Iwo Jima. He was killed in action one week after the flag raising and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.  Early life and career  Chandler W. Johnson was born on October 8, 1905, in Fort Dodge, Iowa. In 1929, Johnson graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps and attended training at the Marine Barracks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He then attended further training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, and then at the Marine Barracks at Portsmouth Navy Yard, Virginia. In April 1931, Johnson deployed to Nicaragua during the Banana Wars, remaining there until the end of 1932. From early 1933 to mid 1934, he was stationed at the Marine Barracks in Boston, Massachusetts. Johnson then attended courses at the Marine Barracks Quantico, Virginia, before he was briefly stationed at the Marine Barracks in Mare Island Navy Yard, California. From late 1935 until the end of 1936, First Lieutenant Johnson was stationed at Olongapo Naval Station in the Philippines. Throughout 1937, Johnson served with the 4th Marine Regiment in China. In 1938, he returned to the Marine Barracks in Portsmouth, Virginia. In January 1939, Captain Johnson attended another course at Quantico, and later that year he was assigned to 1st Battalion, 6th Marines in San Diego, California.  World War II = 3rd Defense Battalion  In mid 1940, Johnson was made the commanding officer of Battery I, 3rd Defense Battalion at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Johnson was with the 3rd Defense Battalion when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, forcing the United States to enter World War II. In late June and early July 1942, the 3rd Defense Battalion conducted several amphibious landing exercises in Hawaii. On August 7, Johnson landed with his battalion in support of the 1st Marine Division at Guadalcanal. The 3rd Defense Battalion left Guadalcanal for New Zealand on February 9, 1943. Johnson was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service during the Guadalcanal campaign. Johnson later took part in the Bougainville campaign with the 3rd Defense Battalion from November 1943 until June 1944. The 3rd Defense Battalion was deactivated shortly afterwards, and Lieutenant Colonel Johnson was reassigned as the commanding officer of 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, 5th Marine Division.  Battle of Iwo Jima  Mount Suribachi (pictured in 2001) is the dominant geographical feature of the island of Iwo Jima On February 19, 1945, Johnson led 2/28 during the amphibious assault of Green Beach during the battle of Iwo Jima. Despite fanatical resistance from the defending Japanese, 2/28 managed to help cut Mount Suribachi off from the rest of the island by the end of the day. On February 20, as Lieutenant Colonel Johnson ordered his Marines to advance toward Mount Suribachi, he said \\"It‚Äôs going to be a hell of a day in a hell of a place to fight the damned war!\\" His battalion suffered significant casualties and only advanced 200 yards that day. Johnson sent a message to 5th Marine Division headquarters in which he stated \\"enemy defenses much greater than expected. There was a pillbox every ten feet.\\" By February 22, the Marines had surrounded Suribachi. = First flag raising = On February 23, Johnson ordered two four-man patrols to reconnoiter routes up to the summit of Mount Suribachi. A patrol from Fox Company, led by Sergeant Sherman B. Watson, successfully reached the top and came back down without drawing any enemy fire. Johnson then ordered the commander of Easy Company, Captain Dave Severance, to send a platoon up Suribachi. Severance in turn ordered First Lieutenant Harold G. Schrier to take 3rd Platoon up the mountain. Just before Schrier left with the platoon, Johnson handed him a 54 by 28 inch American flag and said \\"If you get to the top, put it up.\\" The flag had been taken from the USS Missoula (APA-211) by the battalion adjutant, First Lieutenant George G. Wells. Schrier led his platoon up Suribachi and raised the flag Johnson had given him. James Forrestal, the Secretary of the Navy, arrived at the beach just as the flag was raised. The morale among the Marines increased and Forrestal said to General Holland Smith that \\"the raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next five hundred years.\\" Forrestal was so excited that he then decided he wanted to keep the flag as a souvenir. = Second flag raising = Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, by Joe Rosenthal of the Associated Press Marine Corps photo of the two flags on Mount Suribachi When Lieutenant Colonel Johnson received word of Forrestal's wish, he angrily remarked \\"The hell with that!\\" Johnson wanted to retrieve the flag as soon as possible since he believed the flag belonged to his battalion. Johnson then sent his assistant operations officer, Second Lieutenant Ted Tuttle, down to the beach to secure a larger flag to raise over Suribachi. Johnson then ordered Severance to have his Marines lay a telephone wire up to the top of Suribachi. Severance sent Sergeant Michael Strank, Corporal Harlon Block, and Private First Classes Ira Hayes, Franklin Sousley, and Rene Gagnon to the battalion command post to tie in the telephone wire and obtain radio batteries for Schrier. As the five Marines arrived at the command post, Tuttle also returned to Johnson with a 96 by 56 inch flag which he had acquired from USS LST-779. Johnson handed the flag to Gagnon and then told Strank to raise the second flag and have Schrier \\"save the small flag for me.\\" Strank then led the small group up Suribachi; where Strank, Block, Hayes, Sousley, and Private First Classes Harold SchultzUSMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers, Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016 and Harold Keller raised the second flag. The second flag raising was captured in the famous photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal. The first flag was brought back down Suribachi and returned to Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, who promptly placed it in the battalion safe. = Death = Lieutenant Colonel Johnson continued to lead 2/28 in the battle after the flag raising, advancing to the northeast end of the island. By March 2, the battalion was fighting over rugged terrain north of Hill 362A, in which the Japanese had constructed well-fortified positions. The lead companies sustained heavy casualties and were pinned down, and Johnson moved to the front line in order to reorganize his battalion to continue the assault. As Johnson was moving from one company to another, his body was mangled and he was instantly killed by an exploding mortar round. Chandler W. Johnson was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the battle. His remains were interred in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii.  Portrayal in film  Johnson is featured in the 2006 movie Flags of Our Fathers. In the movie, Johnson is played by American actor Robert Patrick. The movie is based on the 2000 book of the same title.

He was very active in the promotion of apparitions around the world. He is an adherer of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal. Fr. Jozo Zovko was ordained a priest as a Franciscan in 1965. During the alleged Marian apparitions in Medjugorje in 1981, he was a local vicar. The same year he was sentenced to three years in prison because of a sermon allegedly criticising the communist authorities, which Fr. Jozo denied. After being released in 1983, he became a vicar in Tihaljina near Grude, but remained in close touch with Medjugorje. Because of disobedience, the Bishop revoked his priestly jurisdiction, a decree soon afterward confirmed by Rome in 1989, until he moves far from Medjugorje. However, Fr. Jozo continued to be active in Medjugorje and around the world, promoting the apparitions, despite the suspension. He finnaly submitted to the decree under pressure from Rome, and moved to a Franciscan monastery in Badija near Korƒçula in Croatia in 2009, and periodically lived in Graz, Austria, until he moved permanently to Zagreb, Croatia's capital in 2011, where he currently lives.  Biography  Jozo Zovko was born in Uzariƒái near ≈†iroki Brijeg in Herzegovina. He was ordained a priest as a Franciscan on 3 April 1965. He was known to his colleagues by special devotions to Madonna, and often participated in catechetical summer schools as a lecturer and discussant of charismatic orientation. During the alleged Marian apparitions on 24 June 1981, Fr. Jozo was a vicar in Medjugorje. Af first, he was suspicious towards the seers, but became a fierce supporter of the apparitions after Madonna appeared to him as well five days later. In October 1981 he was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for disrespecting the \\"People's Revolution\\" in his sermon on 11 July 1981. In the sermon, Fr. Jozo said that the people should be careful not to be seduced by the \\"false teaching and false teachers\\", which the communist authorities recognised as referring to themselves, however, Fr. Jozo defended his statement claiming it was referring to Bishop Pavao ≈Ωaniƒá. His sentence was reduced, and he was released in February 1983, after which he was appointed a vicar in Tihaljina near Grude. He remained in close touch with Medjugorje however. Because of his disobedience, the Bishop revoked his priestly jurisdiction on the territory of the two Herzegovinian dioceses on 23 August 1989. Fr. Jozo complained over the Bishops decree to the Holy See on 14 October 1989, only to see the Bishop's decree being confirmed on 15 February 1990, with the ruling that the Bishop's sanction will remain in force until he retreats \\"to a monastery remote from Medjugorje\\". Fr. Jozo ignored Rome's ruling, and was appointed a guardian of the Franciscan monastery in ≈†iroki Brijeg. He continued to hear confessions, so the new Bishop Ratko Periƒá revoked his confessional jurisdiction as well in 1994. Fr. Jozo was accused of sexually molesting several women making the pilgrimage in Medjugorje. Fr. Jozo continued to promote the apparitions traveling around the world, and especially the United States. In November 2002, director of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Boston, Walter Rossi, forbade Fr. Jozo to hold a mass there after allegations of disobedience and sexual abuse. However, few days later, Fr. Jozo still held a sermon in Boston. In 2008, the Franciscan Province of Herzegovina requested Fr. Jozo to move to an old Franciscan monastery on the island of Badija near Korƒçula in Croatia and oversee its reconstruction. However, Fr. Jozo ignored the request. He finally submitted to the Roman decree after 19 years and moved to the monastery in Badija on 16 February 2009. The reason behind his moving was the preparation for the establishment of a new commission to investigate the alleged apparitions, and his connection to Medjugorje was seen as an obstacle to the investigation. His official explanation was that he is moving due to the health issues. Afterward, Fr. Jozo lived on a relation between Badija and Graz in Austria, where he would come periodically. He was transferred to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, in December 2011, where he currently lives.  In popular culture  Fr. Jozo was played by Martin Sheen in Gospa (Madonna), a 1995 Croatian movie directed by Jakov Sedlar.

In the early 1950s, Itani began his senior club career at Nejmeh, helping the team gain promotion to the Lebanese Premier League. In 1959, he moved to Racing Beirut, who won the league in the 1964‚Äì65 season, before playing for Tadamon Beirut. He then returned to Nejmeh, where he was the top goalscorer in the Lebanese Premier League in the 1968‚Äì69 season. Itani also played for Lebanon at international level, representing the country in the Arab Nations Cup in the 1960s. Itani was known for his technique and agility, as well as for his skill in controlling the ball in unconventional ways. He was an ambidextrous, offensive full-back who was capable of playing on both flanks. Despite being only tall, Itani could jump to reach high balls. He was also known for his off-field antics; he would play practical jokes, especially on trips abroad with his teams.  Early life  Muhieddine Itani was born in Ras Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, on 6 September 1929. In the winters, he spent time fishing with his father Abdul Razzak and in the summers he went swimming. His father would send him to Sheikh Mohammed Itani to learn to read, write, and memorize the Quran. Itani, however, often ran away from school to spend time playing football in the Nejmeh Stadium. Itani was expelled from school multiple times, remaining illiterate throughout his life. Every afternoon while training at Nejmeh, Itani would see an Englishman called Chance watching him and his teammates train. One day, Chance asked Itani to train in private with him; Itani did \\"not hesitate to accept his offer\\". Itani trained at least four hours a day with Chance. Itani said that his training sessions with Chance developed him as a footballer and he learned the fundamentals of the sport.  Club career  Itani began his senior club career in the early 1950s with Nejmeh under coach Salah Itani. He helped Nejmeh gain promotion to the 1953‚Äì54 Lebanese Premier League for the first time after winning the Lebanese Second Division in 1952. Itani's first game in the Premier League ended in a 3‚Äì0 win against Racing Beirut in which he scored a penalty kick. In 1959, Racing Beirut purchased Itani, who was paid LBP 20,000, an Audi car, and a Vespa scooter, and secured a job at the Regie Company. He was part of the team that won the 1964‚Äì65 Lebanese Premier League. In the 1960s, Itani moved to Tadamon Beirut before rejoining Nejmeh. He was the Lebanese Premier League's top goalscorer of the 1968‚Äì69, scoring 15 goals.  International career  Despite playing in the Lebanese Second Division with Nejmeh in the early 1950s, Itani attracted the attention of the Lebanese national team coach and was called up. On 17 May 1961, he represented Lebanon in an unofficial friendly against Brazil. Itani was part of the team that played in the 1963 Arab Nations Cup, which was held in Lebanon; he played in the opening game of the tournament, a 6‚Äì0 win over Kuwait, and scored an own goal for Tunisia in a game that ended in a 1‚Äì0 defeat. Itani's most memorable game was a 1‚Äì0 win against Libya on 8 March 1964 in an unofficial friendly tournament. He scored the game's only goal through a penalty kick in the final minute. Muhieddine stated he deceived the goalkeeper by \\"looking at the referee as if [he] was talking to him\\"; the goalkeeper was \\"busy looking at the goalposts\\" and \\"only noticed that the goal was scored when the crowd started cheering\\".  Style of play  Due to his ambidexterity, Itani played both as a left-back and a right-back. He was a penalty-kick specialist who was noted for his technique and his movements. He controlled the ball in unique ways, stopping it with both feet or with his lower back. Despite his short stature of , Itani had a high elevation, which enabled him to reach higher balls. Although he played in a more defensive role, often Itani used fast offensive breaks. Once he had already dribbled an opponent, he would often go back to dribble him again because \\"the spectators enjoyed it\\". He was also known for his shooting skills.  After football  After retiring from football, Itani was a long- distance swimmer who was considered to be the only swimmer in Lebanon to participate in every national race, competing symbolically during his old age. In the 2008 annual Christmas race held by the Al Jazeera Sporting Club, at the age of 80, he was the eldest of the 112 participants.  Personal life  Itani was nicknamed Tabello () and was known for his humility and eagerness to help. He was also famous for his pranks, which he especially perpetrated on trips abroad with his football teams. During the 1961 Pan Arab Games, held in Morocco, the national team manager Joseph Nalbandian promised each player he would receive US$3 for every day spent in the tournament. Following the tournament, because the players had not received their tournament bonus, Itani and his teammates came up with a plan. Itani stripped naked in front of a balcony on the third floor of the University of Casablanca, where the national team was residing during the tournament. Passers-by who overlooked the balcony would complain about Itani's nakedness to the hotel manager. The manager spoke to Nalbandian, who asked Itani to \\"wear his clothes\\", giving him the money. Itani traveled with the Lebanese national team to Tunis, Tunisia, to play a friendly game on 9 June 1963 against the Tunisian national team. The Lebanese team was well-received by the local Tunisians; among whom was a mizmar player wearing a skirt. The Lebanese players were annoyed by the mizmar player and asked Itani to ask him to leave. Itani started dancing next to him and put his hand below the musician's skirt. The mizmar player continued to play while jumping up and down; the players were overwhelmed with laughter. In 1959, as part of his transfer to Racing Beirut, Itani was hired by the Regie Company. In 1970, Itani established a fish shop in the Commodore area of Hamra, Beirut; in the 1990s he moved to the city's Karakas neighborhood and opened a fish shop called \\"Al Kalaa Fishery\\" (). Itani's favourite players were Mahmoud Berjawi and Mardek Chabarian in Lebanon, and Pel√© globally. His favourite coach was Ion Bogdan during his time at Racing Beirut. Itani, who had eight children, died on 5 August 2015 aged 85.

Unlike other terreiros that cover large urban or rural spaces, Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho is located in a long, narrow single-story row house. The terreiro is protected as a historic structure by the state of Bahia. History Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho was founded in 1930 by Amazilia Matias da Concei√ß√£o (1906-1997), better known as M√£e Lira de Iemanj√° Ogunt√©. M√£e Lira was an initiate of Terreiro Loba'Nekun, a Candombl√© terreiro in Terra Vermelha, a rural area north of the town of Cachoeira. She was dedicated to the orisha, or deity, Iemanj√°. M√£e Lira was 17 at the time of her initiation, and left Terreiro Loba'Nekun in 1925 to found an independent terreiro, called Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho, filho meaning \\"son\\" in Portuguese. M√£e Lira and members of the terreiros are of nag√¥ origin, or descendants of enslaved people from Fon-speaking people of present-day Nigeria and Benin. Leadership of the terreiro was passed to Zuleide da Paix√£o Lima, better known as M√£e Ledinha de Oy√°, after the death of M√£e Lira. M√£e Ledinha is the niece of the founder. The terreiro expanded after the death of M√£e Lira to occupy an adjacent, narrow house. Location Terreiro Loba Nekun Filho is located on a street that descends from the rear of the Church of Nossa Senhora do Monte, constructed in 1795. Unlike other Candombl√© terreiros in Cachoeira, it is located within the urban center of Cachoeira. The terreiro is in a long row of connected, single- story houses.

Peterson's early works focus on prominent Chinese intellectual figures in the seventeenth century such as Gu Yanwu and Fang Yizhi by placing their writings in the context of new trends of Neo-Confucian philosophy after Wang Yangming as well as the Ming-Qing transition. In the 1980s, he published some of his most influential works in the Sinology circle, including his original annotation on the classical Chinese text The Book of Change, and a series of seminal papers on the Jesuit missionaries and their role in facilitating interactions of scientific knowledges between the East and West in early modern global history. Later, he became an important contributor and editor of the renowned The Cambridge History of China. He was the head editor of its two-part volume 9 on history of the first half of the Qing dynasty, published in 2002 and 2016, respectively.

Spanning the valley from St Nicholas Cliff to The Spa, it was completed in 1827 and is a Grade II listed building. The bridge has four segmental braced iron arches on plain tapering stone piers with stone abutments; its walkway is long. It is a rare example of a multiple-span cast iron bridge. History With the discovery of spa waters in Scarborough in the 17th century, the popularity of the southern part of the town began to rise, with thousands of visitors arriving to take advantage of its medicinal properties. However, although it was easy to access the Spa from the South Bay seafront, a steep descent was required to reach it from the St Nicholas Cliff area of the town. To give access to original \\"Spaw\\" and its mineral spring, the new Cliff Bridge Company was formed in 1826 to lease the Spa from the corporation to maximise its commercial potential by erecting an elegant iron footbridge to span the chasm of the valley from St Nicholas Cliff to the Spa. It is above the valley, long and wide. By only the next year, it was completed, though despite its fast speed of construction, it came at a cost of around ¬£7,000 (), double the original estimate. An opening ceremony was held on 19 July 1827, during which a mail coach was pulled by horses at high speed across the bridge. Due to its popularity it soon became a toll bridge, with a booth erected at the St Nicholas Cliff end of the bridge. For regular users, season tickets were available allowing unlimited access to the bridge and Spa for one, two or four week periods. In 1951, the Corporation of Scarborough purchased the bridge, removing the tolls and demolishing the toll booth. Cliff Bridge, is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 22 December 1953. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to \\"buildings that are nationally important and of special interest\\". The bridge was closed to the public from November 2009 through to April 2010 for a ¬£700,000 general renovation project, including new timber beams spanning the full width of the bridge, replacement of the main bridge deck and refurbishment and repainting of all metal components. The bridge refurbishment made North Yorkshire County Council one of three principal winners in the 2011 Historic Bridge and Infrastructure Awards.

Although in ruins, it has been described as \\"York's oldest house\\", dating from the 12th century. The building was constructed in the late 12th century, about 14 metres to the north of the street of Stonegate. Although the area had been occupied in the Roman Eboracum period, it had been abandoned. It is believed that it was open ground until new building plots were laid out under the influence of the clergy of York Minster, as it lay within the Liberty of St Peter. While many of the new buildings were tenements, others were impressive houses, several of which were used by religious office-holders. The Norman House was a two-storey structure, built of Magnesian Limestone, and based on surviving walls, each floor measured at least 11 feet by 6. The ground floor undercroft had three pillars, supporting the upper storey. This was probably an open hall, and it was lit by windows to the south-west. The York Civic Trust speculates that the house may originally have been built as the house of a Jewish financier. The Jews in York were massacred in 1190, and by the time the house was first recorded, in 1376, it belonged to the prebend of Ampleforth. It remained in use by clergy linked to the Minster for the next few centuries. It was largely demolished in or before the 18th century, but two walls survived, incorporated in later buildings. In 1939, demolition of later buildings revealed the two surviving walls of the house, and also the bases of the pillars of the undercroft, and the base of a garderobe shaft. The shaft and pillars were three-and-a-half feet below the current ground level, and so were covered over, but the walls were preserved, and the former interior of the building made into a small courtyard, so that the remains can be viewed from the inside. They are accessed by a snickelway, running between numbers 50 and 52 Stonegate. The south-east wall is believed to have been a gable end. Its stonework is only present in patches, infilled with later brick, but it does include a cupboard, with grooves showing where doors and a shelf would have sat. The south-west wall is more complete, and includes a double-arched window, in the Norman style. The north-west wall is of a later date, but includes some stones taken from the original house. The house was made a scheduled monument, and in 1954 also became a Grade I listed building. Although it is in ruins, the Civic Trust describes it as \\"York's oldest house\\", while the An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in City of York states that \\"the remains are of great historical interest\\".

The thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Michael originated over the northwestern Caribbean Sea in early October 2018. A series of events took place that led to the formation of tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on October 7. Despite being in a region of strong vertical wind shear, the depression began a period of rapid intensification soon after forming, strengthening into Tropical Storm Michael by 12:00 UTC on the same day. Tracking generally northward, Michael intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale around 12:00 UTC on October 8. The hurricane developed an eye around the same time. The storm passed just west of western Cuba around 18:30 UTC as it reached its initial peak intensity. The eyewall of the storm degraded between October 8‚Äì9, temporarily halting Michael's intensification. Rapid intensification resumed by the middle of October 9 and Michael became a Category 3 major hurricane by 18:00 UTC. The cyclone's eye became well-defined as it strengthened; the eye warmed and became surrounded by very cold cloud-tops. Michael peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a pressure of at 17:30 UTC on October 10, as it made landfall near Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. After landfall, the hurricane rapidly weakened as it moved northeastward, falling to tropical storm intensity by 06:00 UTC on October 11. Michael began to undergo the transition to an extratropical cyclone later in the day as it passed through North Carolina. Michael became fully extratropical on the next day and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. It reacquired hurricane-force winds while south of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on October 13. The extratropical cyclone quickly traveled eastward while weakening, dissipating west of Portugal early on October 16. Origins and development alt=Satellite image of Potential Tropical Cyclone Fourteen developing east of the Yucat√°n Peninsula on October 6 A large area of disturbed weather spawned over the mid-to-western Caribbean Sea around October 1‚Äì2, 2018, and absorbed the remnants of Tropical Storm Kirk. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) anticipated on October 2 that strong upper-level winds would prevent any significant development of the system for at least a couple of days. On the same day, a tropical wave an elongated trough of low air pressure tracked into the area. This possibly led to an increase in thunderstorm activity which in turn gave rise to a surface low southwest of Jamaica on October 3. Although the low was initially predicted to travel northward, it instead tracked west-southwestward and moved ashore in northeastern Honduras on October 4. The low became incorporated into a broad cyclonic gyre which was located over Central America by October 5. A center which was located over the eastern Pacific moved across Central America on October 6 and integrated into the gyre. The gyre's center reformed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on the same day. Due to the imminent threat that the system posed to land, the NHC began issuing advisories on it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Fourteen around 21:00 UTC on October 6. Meanwhile, an upper- level trough located over the Gulf of Mexico was imparting vertical wind shear over the system. Despite this, the system's convection or thunderstorm activity, as well as its circulation, were improving in organization on both satellite imagery and in surface observations. Around that time, Belizean radar showed that convection was forming just northeast of the depression's low-level center. The nascent depression was located in an environment of strong wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Around 12:00 UTC, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name Michael. During the next six hours, the center of the storm relocated to the northeast as a result of flaring convection in that region. The system then proceeded to travel slightly east of north as it rounded the western periphery of a mid- level ridge that was located over the western Atlantic. Rapid intensification and landfall at peak intensity Hurricane Michael making landfall in the Florida Panhandle at peak intensity on October 10. After forming, Michael began a period of rapid intensification. Initially, the NHC had predicted Michael to reach a peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) as wind shear was expected to persist for at least two days, A WC-130 aircraft from the United States Air Force Reserve 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron discovered that Michael had been quickly intensifying as it surveyed the tropical cyclone in the afternoon and evening of October 7, measuring peak stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) winds between 45‚Äì60 mph (75‚Äì100 km/h) during its mission. Although Michael had strengthened to 60 mph (95 km/h) by 00:00 UTC on October 8, most of the storm's convection remained displaced to its eastern side as a result of the wind shear. Microwave imagery, however, showed that the core of Michael had improved, with one banding feature curving around most of the storm. The tropical storm continued to organize, with convection and outflow increasing in the western half of the system. Michael became a Category 1 hurricane around 12:00 UTC on October 8. An eye was beginning to appear in satellite imagery around the same time. Around 18:30 UTC on October 8, Michael reached its initial peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) as it tracked just west of Cabo del San Antonio, Cuba. During the overnight, Michael's eyewall began to degrade due to a cold water eddy, dry air incursion, and wind shear, signaling that the rapid intensification had ceased. Shortly after, the hurricane's banding features began to improve as the system was located over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. By 12:00 UTC on October 9, Michael had begun to rapidly intensify once more; its eye had become better defined and outflow improved as the westerly shear decreased. Meanwhile, the hurricane was tracking north-northwest due to a mid-level ridge. The tropical cyclone strengthened into a Category 3 major hurricane by 18:00 UTC as cold convection developed over the eastern and southeastern regions of the storm and wrapped around its eyewall. Cloud temperatures decreased to in the central dense overcast and were as low as in the eyewall. Michael resumed a northward trek early on October 10 as it traveled between the ridge and a mid-latitude shortwave trough. Outflow generated by the trough may have hastened Michael's rapid intensification until landfall. The outer rainbands of Michael began to move ashore around 10:00 UTC, and the cyclone's eye continued to warm as it approached the Florida Panhandle, however, radar imagery showed a secondary eyewall was beginning to form. The hurricane's direction shifted to the northeast under the influence of the westerlies. Michael reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of around 17:30 UTC on October 10, as it made landfall near Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. Operationally, the NHC had reported Michael's landfall intensity as 155 mph (250 km/h) based on flight-level winds of 175 mph (282 km/h) and SFMR readings between 152‚Äì159 mph (244‚Äì256 km/h). However, some data from the SFMR instrument was missing and had to be reconstructed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Aircraft Operation Center. This data yielded a peak SFMR value of 175 mph (282 km/h) for the time that the reconnaissance aircraft surveyed the southern eyewall. Additionally, doppler weather radar from Eglin Air Force Base estimated peak winds of 178 mph (287 km/h) at 17:22 UTC, around the same location as the aircraft. The radar also displayed that stronger winds existed northeast of the aircraft, outside its field of observation. Trek over land, extratropical transition, and demise alt=Satellite image of Michael as a hurricane-force extratropical cyclone on October 13 After moving ashore, Michael quickly became less intense; by 21:30 UTC on October 10, just four hours after landfall, Michael had weakened below Category 3 status before moving into southwestern Georgia. Around that time, the hurricane was continuing to track northeast under the influence of the westerlies. Doppler radar displayed that Michael had continued to degrade, with the storm weakening into a high-end Category 1 hurricane by 00:00 UTC. At that time, the peak winds were confined to a region of convection near Michael's low-level center. Six hours later, Michael fell to tropical storm intensity, with only a small zone of storm-force winds existing near its center. Most of the peak winds were displaced to the southeast, over the Atlantic Ocean. The storm entered South Carolina around 15:00 UTC on October 11. By that time, all of the gale-force winds associated with Michael were occurring over the Atlantic Ocean and along the shoreline. As Michael entered North Carolina late on October 11, it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Cold, dry air entrained into the storm's circulation. Winds also increased northwest of the storm's elongating center, over the states of North Carolina and Virginia. Michael became fully extratropical by 00:00 UTC on October 12 as it traveled east-northeastward, just north of Raleigh, North Carolina. Around that time, another low-level center with a lower pressure had formed farther north, near Chesapeake Bay, as baroclinic processes began to restrengthen the former hurricane. The extratropical cyclone emerged into the Atlantic around 06:00 UTC after passing near Norfolk, Virginia. Michael obtained hurricane-force winds on October 13 while in the Atlantic waters south of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. It then quickly traveled to the northeastern Atlantic by October 14. The cyclone turned sharply southeastward and later southward around the northeastern edge of the ridge, weakening slightly, as it approached the Iberian Peninsula. Michael dissipated by 00:00 UTC on October 16, located just west of northern Portugal. Records With maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a central pressure of at landfall, Michael was the most intense landfalling mainland U.S. hurricane since Camille in 1969, which had a central pressure of . Hurricane Michael was also the first landfalling Category 5 Atlantic hurricane in the U.S. since Andrew in 1992, which had 165 mph (270 km/h) winds. Michael is tied with the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane for the sixth-strongest tropical cyclone by wind speed to impact the United States (including its overseas territories), and was the fourth strongest to impact the U.S. mainland. Additionally, Michael was the second-most intense hurricane by pressure to make landfall in Florida, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, and the third strongest by wind, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Andrew. Michael was the second-most intense hurricane to have made landfall during the month of October in the North Atlantic basin (including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea), behind the 1924 Cuba hurricane. Michael was also the first recorded Category 4 or 5 hurricane to strike the Florida Panhandle since reliable records began in 1851.

The union also petitioned the Commune's economic director for work for women. He recommended organizing workshops for women to work at home, to be designed by the women's union. The group investigated the needs of unemployed women and created cooperative workshops. It did not designate roles based on trades but centralized the distribution of orders for women to complete and return to the workshop for delivery. This system differed from the piece-work originally proposed by Commune officials, which would have preserved the order of women staying at home and previous style of labor.

He played college football at Oklahoma State and Hawaii.  College career  Brown did not start until his senior season of high school, and did not receive any Division I offers. He opted to attend the College of San Mateo his freshman year, playing in 11 games and completed 104 of 194 passes for 1,870 yards and 21 touchdowns. He then transferred to Hawaii for the 2016 season.  Hawaii  2016 = After not playing in Hawaii's first three games, Brown entered the Rainbow Warriors fourth game against Arizona in the second half, replacing Ikaika Woolsey. Brown was able to direct the Rainbow Warriors to three touchdown drives in the second half, however they lost to Arizona 47‚Äì28. Brown was named the starting quarterback before the Rainbow Warriors matchup against Nevada. Against Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl, Brown threw for 274 yards and four touchdowns while also accounting for a rushing touchdown en route to a 52-35 victory. Brown was also named one of the game's MVP for his efforts. = 2017 = Coming off of Hawaii's first bowl victory in ten years, Brown was once again named the starting quarterback for the 2017 season. Brown threw for 2,785 yards and 18 touchdowns that season on a struggling Rainbow Warriors team that lost nine of the last ten games, mostly attributed to a battered offensive line whose position coach left mid-way through the season, and top receiver John Ursua lost to a torn ACL. After the 2017 season, Brown announced his intention to transfer. He enrolled at Oklahoma State as a graduate transfer, and was immediately eligible to play. Brown finished his career at Hawaii with 5,273 career passing yards, and 37 touchdowns.  Oklahoma State  2018 = At Oklahoma State, Brown joined a crowded QB room competing for the Cowboys starting quarterback job following the departure of four-year starter Mason Rudolph. Brown was named the primary backup quarterback to starter Taylor Cornelius before the start of 2018 season. Despite playing in the Cowboys' bowl game, Brown was able to redshirt under the NCAA's new redshirt policy and keep his final year of eligibility. = 2019 = Following the graduation and departure of Cornelius, Brown was one the favorites to win the starting quarterback job, competing with redshirt freshman Spencer Sanders for it. Brown was once again named the primary backup as Sanders was named the starting quarterback for the Cowboys season opener against Oregon State. After Sanders suffered a hand injury in the middle of a game against Kansas, Brown entered the game in relief and threw a touchdown pass on his first play. He finished the game with 3 completions on 5 attempts for 70 yards and a touchdown in the 31‚Äì6 victory. Brown started his first career game as a Cowboy against West Virginia the next week, where he racked up 196 yards and two touchdowns in a 20‚Äì13 victory.

The battery was organized in January 1862 at Shawneetown and spent most of 1862‚Äì1863 on guard duty in western Kentucky. However, part of the battery participated in Grierson's Raid and the Siege of Port Hudson in 1863. The battery fought at Okolona, Tupelo, Spring Hill, and Franklin in 1864. The battery mustered out of Federal service in December 1864; new recruits and re- enlisted veterans transferred to Battery \\"E\\", 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment. Personnel Battery K, 1st Illinois Light Artillery formed at Shawneetown, Illinois (now Old Shawneetown) and mustered into Federal service on 9 January 1862. The original officers were Captain Angrean Franklin of Vienna, Illinois, First Lieutenants Jason B. Smith and Joseph P. Shelton, both of Vienna, and Second Lieutenants William O. Stephenson of Vienna and James G. Helm of Metropolis. Franklin resigned on 31 March 1862 and was replaced as captain by Smith on 1 April 1862. First Sergeant Isaac W. Curtis of Metropolis was also promoted first lieutenant on that date. Other personnel were four sergeants, eight corporals, Quartermaster Joseph W. Franklin, Bugler Jasper N. Cross, Farrier William L. Marberey, and Blacksmith Ambrose H. Smith, and Wagoner George Clark. There were 74 men enrolled as private. Battery K was part of the 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment which organized at Chicago, Springfield, Ottawa, and Cairo, Illinois. There were 12 batteries named A‚ÄìM, not including J. The different batteries belonging to the regiment formed between 16 July 1861 (A and B) and 12 August 1862 (M), and enlisted for three years' service. Each battery served independently of the others. The regiment's original commander was Colonel Joseph Dana Webster. Captain Smith resigned on 11 September 1864. First Lieutenant Shelton died on 13 December 1862. Second Lieutenant Stephenson resigned on 20 March 1863. Curtis was promoted captain on 11 September 1864 and mustered out when the battery consolidated with Battery E on 14 February 1865. Almost all the original soldiers were from Vienna, Metropolis, and Golconda, Illinois, though four were from Marion, Kentucky and one from Shawneetown. Re-enlisting as veterans on 20 March 1864 were 22 privates. Beginning in July 1862, 57 men were recruited into the battery. At consolidation, the veterans and recruits transferred to Battery E, 1st Illinois Light Artillery. History=Grierson's Raid Battery K was ordered to move to Cairo in March 1862. The unit was attached to the District of Columbus, Kentucky in March‚ÄìNovember 1862. The battery remained in Cairo, Paducah, Kentucky, or within the District of Columbus until November 1862, and part of the unit continued serving there through October 1863. The battery was attached to XIII Corps in November‚ÄìDecember 1862 and to XVI Corps in December 1862‚ÄìMarch 1863. The unit was assigned to 6th Division, XVI Corps in March‚ÄìOctober 1863. Battery K was assigned to 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, XVI Corps in October‚ÄìNovember 1863. Benjamin Grierson One section of Battery K was detached to Benjamin Grierson's Cavalry Brigade, XIII Corps, Army of the Tennessee in November 1862‚ÄìMarch 1863. Evidently, this section performed the most active service during 1863. The section took part in Ulysses S. Grant's Central Mississippi campaign in November 1862‚ÄìJanuary 1863. The unit participated in a reconnaissance from La Grange to Collierville, Tennessee on 5 November 1862. The section was in action at Ripley, Mississippi on 23 December and Bolivar, Tennessee on 24 December. The section was assigned to 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, XVI Corps in March‚ÄìMay 1863. While being stationed at Lagrange and Memphis, Tennessee until April 1863, the section went on an expedition from Lagrange on 8‚Äì13 March, including skirmishes at Covington, Tennessee on 9‚Äì10 March. From 17 April to 2 May 1863, the detached section took part in Grierson's Raid from La Grange to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The 1,700 raiders consisted of the 6th Illinois, and 7th Illinois, and 2nd Iowa Cavalry Regiments, plus a detachment of six 2-pounder Woodruff guns from Captain Jason B. Smith's Battery K, 1st Illinois Artillery. On 20 April, Grierson sent back 175 of his least fit cavalrymen to confuse his Confederate pursuers. The raiders reached Okolona, Mississippi on 21‚Äì22 April, Garlandville on 24 April, Union Church on 28 April, Brookhaven on 29 April, Wall's Post Office, Louisiana on 1 May, and the Comite River on 2 May. The Woodruff guns contributed to the raid's success. One source stated that the Union cavalry units which took part in Grierson's Raid were supported by either four or six Woodruff guns. Colonel Edward Hatch of the 2nd Iowa Cavalry called the guns 2-pounders. After the raid, Battery K's detached section joined the Cavalry Brigade, XIX Corps, Department of the Gulf through July 1863. The section fought in the Battle of Plains Store on 21 May 1863 and participated in the Siege of Port Hudson from 24 May to 9 July. During the siege, the section was in action at Clinton, Louisiana on 3-4 June and Jackson Cross Roads on 20 June. After the siege, the section traveled to Memphis on 18‚Äì28 July where it rejoined the remainder of Battery K. Okolona to Franklin Edward Hatch The full Battery K was assigned to 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, XVI Corps in July‚ÄìNovember 1863. The unit was stationed at Germantown, Tennessee until November. On 4‚Äì17 October, the battery participated in operations against Confederates under James Ronald Chalmers in north Mississippi and west Tennessee. The unit scouted from Germantown to Tullahoma on 22‚Äì24 October. Battery K was assigned to 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, 16th Army Corps From November 1863 to June 1864. It took part in operations on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad on 3‚Äì5 November, including at Moscow, Tennessee. and again on 28 November‚Äì10 December against Confederates under Stephen D. Lee. In the latter operation, there was clash at Saulsbury, Tennessee on 3 December. The battery was involved in a skirmish at Collierville on 27‚Äì28 December 1863. The battery participated in William Sooy Smith's cavalry expedition from Collierville to Okolona and West Point, Mississippi on 11‚Äì26 February 1864. At West Point, though confronted by a very inferior force under Nathan Bedford Forrest, W. S. Smith ordered his 7,000 cavalry and 20 guns to begin a retreat on 21 February. In the Battle of Okolona on 22 February, a brigade of Federal cavalry panicked and galloped away, causing five guns to be abandoned. W. S. Smith's report stated that the fleeing cavalry, \\"drove a battery of little pop-guns off into a ditch, where it was so badly smashed up that we could not get it along\\". He asserted that the guns were spiked, the ammunition was destroyed, and the horses were saved. W. S. Smith noted that it was Perkins' battery of six M1841 mountain howitzers, and not Battery K. Forrest reported having no more than 2,500 Confederate cavalry. Colonel George E. Waring Jr., who commanded one of the Federal brigades reported that the, \\"expedition filled every man connected with it with burning shame\\". Smith reported 388 casualties. Small caliber gun similar in size to the 2-pounder Woodruff gun Battery K was assigned to 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, District of West Tennessee in June‚ÄìNovember 1864. The unit performed garrison duty at Germantown and Memphis until July. The battery took part in Andrew Jackson Smith's expedition to Tupelo, Mississippi on 5‚Äì21 July, including the Battle of Tupelo on 14‚Äì15 July 1864. By deft marching, A. J. Smith's 14,000 soldiers and 24 guns occupied Tupelo and took up a defensive position. On 14 July, S. D. Lee and Forrest attacked A. J. Smith's positions with 9,000 men and 20 guns, but were repulsed. The Federals sustained 714 casualties while inflicting losses of 1,326 killed and wounded on the Confederates. On 15 July, the Federal column began a withdrawal to Memphis while repelling several Confederate attacks during the day. Battery K accompanied a second A. J. Smith expedition to Oxford, Mississippi on 1‚Äì30 August. There were minor actions at the Tallahatchie River on 7‚Äì9 August, Oxford on 9 August, and Hurricane Creek on 13‚Äì14 and 19 August. The battery participated in operations in middle Tennessee and north Alabama on 30 September‚Äì1 November. Battery K was attached to 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, Cavalry Corps, Military Division Mississippi, in November‚ÄìDecember 1864. The battery was assigned to Datus E. Coon's 2nd Brigade, Edward Hatch's 5th Division, and James H. Wilson's Cavalry Corps. The unit took part in the Franklin‚ÄìNashville Campaign in north Alabama and middle Tennessee on 1 November‚Äì10 December. Hatch's division was originally intended to accompany Sherman's March to the Sea, but George H. Thomas withheld it to provide a cavalry screen between his army and John Bell Hood's Confederate army. Hatch's division arrived near the Tennessee River on 6 November to observe Hood's army. Battery K was near Shoal Creek on 11 November and again on 16‚Äì20 November. On 21 November, Hatch reported Hood had 10,000 cavalry and 30,000‚Äì35,000 infantry advancing toward Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, a fairly accurate assessment. By 22 November 1864, Battery K was at Lawrenceburg and on 24 November it was at Campbellsville. In a skirmish at Campbellsville, Hatch's cavalry was beaten, but they diverted their foes away from John Schofield's two corps, which were retreating toward Columbia. In the event, Schofield's infantry got to Columbia before Hood's cavalry reached it. On 29 November, Forrest outmaneuvered Wilson's Union cavalry then turned west to cut Schofield's line of retreat. By 10:00 pm that evening 19,000 Confederate infantry faced only 6,000 Federals in the Battle of Spring Hill. After an astonishing communications breakdown in Hood's army, Schofield's army escaped the trap. At the Battle of Franklin on 30 November, Hatch's 2,800-man division defeated William Hicks Jackson's 2,500-man cavalry division at Hughes Ford and compelled it to abandon its bridgehead on the north bank of the Duck River. The soldiers of Battery K were mustered out of service on 10 December 1864. Veterans and recruits transferred to Battery \\"E,\\" 1st Illinois Light Artillery. The battery lost 11 Enlisted men by disease while in service. Reorganized Battery K Colvin's Battery Illinois Light Artillery was renamed Battery K, 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment in March 1865. The battery was attached to 2nd Brigade, 4th Division, Department of East Tennessee. The unit garrisoned Cumberland Gap and other places in east Tennessee. The battery was mustered out of Federal service on 15 July 1865.

The images must be converted to 32-bit FITS format which is the format used natively by Siril. Also, it is possible to use the SER format (limited to 16 bits), generally used during \\"fast\\" planetary or deep sky acquisitions, without prior conversions. It is based on the GNOME environment and therefore can be run on many systems like GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, and Windows. It is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL.  History  The project was launched in 2005 by Fran√ßois Meyer. Siril, meaning IRIS (spelled backwards) for Linux was originally designed to overcome the lack of astronomical image processing software under the GNU/Linux system . Initially, it was developed to be a clone of Christian Buil's software, IRIS. In 2012, a new team took over the development of the project abandoned in 2007 in order to meet the increasing needs of astrophotographers. Today, Siril works under the main operating systems including Windows.  Features  Siril allows the conversion of a large number of formats (images or videos) to FITS. * The calibration, alignment and stacking of astronomical images is done by navigating through the tabs of the \\"control center\\". However, an algorithm for the automatic detection and correction of defective pixels is available off the tab, in the Image processing menu. * Since version 0.9.7, the global alignment which uses a recognized algorithm for this task has been added an optimization method thanks to the OpenCV library. In fact, Siril's automatic alignment allows to align images obtained with instruments of different focal lengths.right * Some image processing algorithms are available in the standard menu: Histogram Transformation, Color Calibration, Banding Reduction... right * Siril has a photometric analysis tool. Therefore, it is possible to study the transits of exoplanets, the variability of stars or even occultations. This tool requires the installation of gnuplot. * Since version 0.9.9, the ability to create scripts has been integrated into Siril. All you have to do is drop script files with the .ssf extension in a folder named 'scripts' and whose location is defined in the program's settings. After a restart, a new menu entry appears and allows the execution of the installed scripts. Preprocessing + alignment + stacking can thus be fully automated. * Also since version 0.9.9, it is possible to launch Siril through the console and run a script without the GUI. This can be useful when piloting a telescope remotely and only want to recover the pre-processed image. For example, enter the following command in a terminal: siril -s ~/.siril/scripts/Traitememnt.ssf -d ~/Images/M31 runs the Processing.ssf script in the M31 images directory. * Version 0.9.10 introduces a new feature: commands can be sent through one named pipe while logs and status can be obtained through another. The mode is activated using the command line argument \`-p\`. Native file formats=FITS Currently, Siril works internally with 32-bit FITS floating point images. Users can configure the program to work in unsigned 16-bit FITS format, in order to save computation time and disk space at the expense of image accuracy. Compression of FITS images is supported since version 0.99.4. SER The SER file format is a simple image sequence format, similar to uncompressed movies. Files in this format, widely preferred by astrophotographers in planetary imaging, do not need to be converted and can be edited on the fly.

Reception  Churails has received widespread critical acclaim. It has been hailed as a groundbreaking series that breaks stereotypes about Pakistanis and abandons oft-used tropes in Pakistani television. It has been lauded for its portrayal of three-dimensional women as well as for exploring social dynamics in a diverse city like Karachi, portraying women across social classes and backgrounds. Furthermore, it has been praised for its sensitive and nuanced depictions of LGBT characters, with gay men, lesbian women and transgender characters. Abbasi said, \\"Because we are showing such a diverse range of women, it was important to show the entire spectrum of sexuality. It would have been wrong if they were all straight because not all women in Pakistan are straight.\\" Shaheera Anwar at The Express Tribune gave the series 4.5/5 stars, writing \\"Without compromising on the storytelling, Churails is a feminist masterpiece.\\" Shubhra Gupta at The Indian Express wrote: \\"To watch free-spirited, cussing-out-loud, hockey-sticks and rifle-toting, burqa-clad women beating the bejesus out of violent, murderous men, is one of the high points of Churails\\".

After his mother's death, when he was seven, he ran away from home and spent five years living with an old village school teacher. The teacher also died, and he had to support himself for several years. He returned home in 1781 and helped his father paint ships, but found the work unpleasant; preferring to paint coffins, sledges, chests and similar items for the local peasants. In 1784, thanks to assistance from Admiral Carl Tersmeden, he was able to go to Stockholm and find employment in the stage decoration workshop at the Royal Swedish Opera. There, his work drew the attention of and Louis Jean Desprez, who took him on as a personal apprentice. In 1791, he was hired as a regular decorative painter there; a position he would hold well into the 19th century. On the advice of Desprez and the sculptor, Johan Tobias Sergel, he used the model school at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts to improve his skills and promote himself. In 1802, he was chosen as an agr√© (member-candidate) at the Academy and, the following year, was awarded full membership. In 1812, he was named a Professor of drawing and, in 1813, was appointed a court painter. He married Ulrika Wargentin in 1791. Their daughter, , also became an artist.

A forest road (north-south direction) serves the west side of the middle and lower part of this valley, connecting the Grand-Lac-Sal√© Ecological Reserve, and the main road passing through the center-north of the island. Forestry is the main economic activity in this area; recreational tourism activities, second.Map Geonames - Rivi√®re Galiote  Geography  The Galiote River originates from the confluence of two mountain streams (altitude: ), located in the south-central part of the island. This source is located in a forest area at: * west of Tour-Chicotte; * south of Lake Wickenden; * east of the town center of the village of Port- Menier; * south of the north shore of Anticosti Island; * northeast of the south shore of Anticosti Island. From its source, the Galiote River flows on with a drop of , according to the following segments: * towards the south, collecting a stream (coming from the north-west), a second (coming from the north-east) and a third (coming from the west), up to a bend in the river, corresponding to a stream (coming from the west). Note: The place called Galiote-la-Chute is on the west bank of this bend in the river; * eastward in a deep valley, to a bend in the river, corresponding to a stream (coming from the northeast). Note: The place called Galiote-la-Fourche is on the southwest bank of this bend in the river; * towards the south in a deep valley, until the discharge (coming from the east) of two lakes; * towards the south, passing under the forest road bridge that runs along the southern coast of Anticosti Island, to its mouth. The Galiote river flows on the east side of Gand lac Sal√©, Petit lac Sal√©, Baie des Sables and C√¥te de la Grande Travers√©e, on the south shore of Anticosti Island, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. This confluence is located at: * east of Pointe de la Tourbe; * east of the mouth of the rivi√®re du Brick; * west of the mouth of the rivi√®re aux Rats; * east of the village center of Port-Menier.  Toponymy  David T√™tu, responsible for the surveillance of wrecked ships from 1870 to 1879, at the Pointe du Sud lighthouse, used ‚ÄúGaliote River‚Äù to designate this river on his map. According to the 17th Report of the Geographic Survey of Canada (1922), this watercourse has been designated according to several graphic variations: Galiote River, River Galiotte, Sabotte River and Galti River. The term \\"galiote\\" refers to a sailing ship, with round shapes, used by Dutch navigators. Throughout history, the term \\"galiote\\" has also referred to a coaster and a fishing sailboat. However, the origin of the attribution of this toponymic designation remains unknown. It is reasonable to believe that this toponym evokes the shipwreck of a galiote not far from the mouth of this river. Anticosti Island is nicknamed the ‚ÄúGulf Cemetery‚Äù because more than 400 shipwrecks have been recorded since the island was donated as a fief and seigneury to Louis Jolliet in 1680. On the one hand, this statistic further supports the hypothesis of the origin of the name of the Galiote river. In addition, similar toponyms of the waterways of Anticosti Island, such as Havre du Brick and Pointe √† la Go√©lette, evoke shipwrecks. In 1959, the Commission de g√©ographie du Qu√©bec retained the toponymic designation ‚ÄúRivi√®re Galiote‚Äù.Book: ‚ÄúNames and places of Quebec‚Äù, work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary. The toponym ‚Äúrivi√®re Galiote‚Äù was made official on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - Rivi√®re Galiote  Lac-Sal√© Ecological Reserve  In 1991, the Quebec government established the \\"Lac-Sal√© Ecological Reserve\\" covering approximately 7000 hectares. Briefly, this reserve was delimited by the middle of the rivi√®re du Brick from its confluence with the Honguedo Strait, going up the river to latitude 5,468,000 m N; thence, easterly, to the center of the Galiote river; then south following the center of the latter river, until its confluence with the Honguedo Strait. Gazette officielle du Qu√©bec, October 30, 1991, part 2 (no. 44).  Recreational tourism activities  Between kilometers 7 and 11, the Galiote river offers a wild setting with little steep edges. The stony plateau allows walking there if the water is low as if it is an unmarked path on the bottom of the river. In the surroundings, walkers often see hares and deer. The flora of this area includes many rare species.Article \\"Voyage to Anticosti Island, July 7 to 14, 2007\\", by Andr√© Sabourin and Gordon Macpherson, FloraQuebeca, July 2008 - Volume 13, page 3.

April 22‚Äì30  On April 22, former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts announced that her oldest brother had died from COVID-19 in Oklahoma. On April 24, Governor Baker announced that while COVID-19 cases and testing were up in Massachusetts, hospitalizations have started to decrease and reached the lowest point since early April. Massachusetts recorded 4,946 new cases partially due to an error by Quest Diagnostics in missing more than 10,000 test results, both positive and negative, recorded in April 24 data. On April 25, Governor Baker addressed the topic of when stay-at-home measures and closures of non-essential businesses would end. When restrictions were originally announced in mid-March, they were slated to end at noon on April7; later their projected end date was pushed to May4. Baker said it was unlikely restrictions would be lifted by then because the surge of cases had hit later than expectedMay4 presumed a surge in early April. Baker said the process of reopening will begin when hospitalizations start to decline consistently, and when there is \\"some evidence that we are in fact over the hump... with respect to the surge.\\" On April 28, Governor Baker extended the statewide stay-at-home advisory by two weeks, to May 18. He also said that once the advisory expires, the process of reopening will begin in stages, and not happen all at once. Also on April 28, it was reported that at the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke, at least 68 veteransnearly 30 percent of the home's residentshad died of COVID-19 in what is believed to be the deadliest outbreak at a long-term care facility in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.  May = May 1‚Äì7  On May 1, Governor Baker issued an order, effective May 6, to require people to cover their faces in public when in situations where they are unable to keep six feet away from others. On May 4, a group of several hundred anti- lockdown protesters gathered outside the Massachusetts State House to urge Governor Baker to lift the state's stay-at-home advisory and reopen businesses.

The event was promoted by conservative talk radio host Jeffrey Kuhner and Super Happy Fun America, the group responsible for organizing the controversial 2019 Boston Straight Pride Parade.  May 8‚Äì14  On May 8, Boston Mayor Walsh announced that parades and festivals would not take place in Boston at least until Labor Day (September 7). On May 11, Governor Baker announced a four-phased plan to reopen the state. In phase one, a small number of industries that do not involve much face-to-face interaction will be allowed to return to operating, with strict restrictions in place. In phase two, more industries will be allowed to open, with restrictions including limits on the number of people allowed to gather in one place. In phase three, more industries will open, with guidance on how to operate safely. Phase four is set to occur if a vaccine or therapy is developed allowing restrictions to be loosened. The state also published Mandatory Workplace Safety Standards to be followed by industries that will open as a part of phase one. These standards include requirements for social distancing, hygiene, staffing policies, and cleaning and disinfecting.  May 15‚Äì21  On May 18, Governor Baker released the details of the plan to reopen businesses in Massachusetts, and renamed the stay-at-home advisory to a \\"safer at home\\" advisory. The plan allows places of worship, essential businesses, manufacturing businesses, and construction sites to reopen with strict restrictions on May 18. Also as of May 18, hospitals and health centers may begin providing urgent preventative care and treatment services to high-risk patients. Baker also announced that people who choose to ride the MBTA will be required to wear masks. Beginning on May 25, additional businesses will be able to open, also with restrictions. Although Baker's plan includes office buildings in the list of businesses allowed to open on May 25, offices within Boston will not be allowed to open until June 1.  May 22‚Äì31  On May 26, Baker said in a press conference that the surge in COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts is over, as evidenced by declining numbers of people hospitalized by the disease. He announced that the Boston Hope field hospital, located in the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, would no longer be accepting new patients. The facility has treated more than 700 people with COVID-19, and has also provided shelter to some of Boston's homeless community. Baker also said that other field hospitals around the state would begin to close. Baker also announced $6million in grants to go to small businesses to help them purchase protective equipment and implement the safety precautions indicated in the reopening plan. The Boston Athletic Association announced on May 28 that the 2020 Boston Marathon, which had already been postponed to September, would be canceled.  June  On June 1, Massachusetts began reporting probable cases of and deaths due to COVID-19 in their data, when previously they had only been reporting confirmed cases and deaths. This change follows guidance from the U.S. CDC. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health said in a statement that probable cases are recorded for people who \\"have either 1) had a positive antibody test and either had COVID symptoms or were likely to be exposed to a positive case or 2) did not have an antibody test but had COVID symptoms and were known to be exposed to a positive case.\\" Probable deaths are defined as deaths where COVID-19 was listed on the death certificate as the cause of death, but where no test was administered. Due to these changes in reporting, Massachusetts became the 5th state in the U.S. to report over 100,000 cases of the contagious disease. On June 3, Massachusetts began reporting recoveries in their weekly data report. Previously, they had not been reporting the number of cumulative recoveries in their data. A patient is considered to be recovered if they have either been sick for 21 days or 21 days have passed since they tested positive. Governor Baker announced on June 6 that Massachusetts would begin entering phase two of the reopening plan starting on Monday, June 8, following positive trends in access to testing and decreasing hospitalizations. The first portion of the phase will allow childcare, day camps, lodging retail stores, outdoor seating at restaurants, and children's sports programs to reopen with strict precautions. Additional services, including indoor dining and nail and tanning salons, will be allowed to reopen at an unspecified later date as a part of phase two if the positive trends in COVID-19 cases continue. Boston entered phase two of their reopening plan on June 8. Amid ongoing protests over the May killing of George Floyd, Governor Baker announced pop-up testing sites would open throughout the state on June 17 and 18 to provide free tests to protesters and anyone else who wished to be tested. During the period 11‚Äì17 June, Worcester county had the second highest number of deaths in the state with 39. On June 22, WBUR reported that Massachusetts had become the state with the lowest COVID-19 transmission rate in the country. The June 22 Rt, a value measuring the average rate of transmission of a virus at a point in time, was 0.67 in Massachusetts. According to rt.live, the website calculating the values, an Rt value of 1.0 or above is considered to signify \\"rapid spread\\". The June unemployment rate was later calculated at 17.4%, a record high and the worst of any U.S. state at the time.Mass. Unemployment Rate Rises To 17.4%, Worst In The Country  July  On July 2, Governor Baker announced that Massachusetts would enter the first stage of phase three of its reopening plan starting on Monday, July 6. Phase three allows companies including gyms, casinos, and museums to open with safety precautions. Boston will delay entering phase three until July 13. Governor Baker announced on July 8 that free testing centers would open in eight communities that are seeing high viral spread: Chelsea, Everett, Fall River, Lawrence, Lowell, Lynn, Marlborough, and New Bedford. These areas are experiencing considerably higher positive test rates than the state average, and the testing rate has been growing lower. The Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference announced on July 16 that it was suspending the fall 2020 sports season. Applying to both indoor and outdoor sports, the decision impacts Bridgewater State University, Fitchburg State University, Framingham State University, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Salem State University, Westfield State University, and Worcester State University, as well as other universities which are affiliate members of the conference for football or golf. To improve revenues for restaurants with liquor licenses, Governor Baker signed a law on July 21 allowing restaurants to serve cocktails to go in sealed containers until at least February.Massachusetts restaurants can sell cocktails to-go until at least February because of the coronavirus pandemic Also on July 21, Baker extended the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures in the state through October 17, 2020. The MBTA resumed collecting fares and requiring front-door boarding on buses and trolleys on July 20, having installed plexiglass shields for drivers. Towards the end of the month, Massachusetts began to experience a slight reversal in what had previously been positive trends in case data. Governor Baker blamed \\"disturbing reports of large gatherings\\" on the uptick in cases, a trend he described as attributable to people not following guidelines rather than a result of moving forward in the state's reopening plan. On July 26, president of the Massachusetts Medical Society Dr. David Rosman tweeted, \\"Pay attention #Massachusetts ‚Äî #COVID19 is on the rise. The numbers show it. The anecdotes show it.\\" Rosman is among a group of people who have pushed Baker to pause the reopening plan, or move back from stage three to stage two, if case data continues to show a negative trend. The city of Somerville, which was the only city or town in Massachusetts that had not entered phase three of the reopening plan by the end of July, announced on July 31 that they would be further delaying entering the third phase. Officials said they had based the decision on concerns about case trends, issues with testing and contact tracing, and the possibility of another surge in cases.  August  Beginning on August 1, visitors and Massachusetts residents returning from out of state need to fill out a form and quarantine for two weeks, unless they are coming from an exempt state or have tested negative for COVID-19 in the past 72 hours. State exemptions are based on a threshold for rolling averages of daily cases and positive test rates; individuals can also be exempted if they are commuting for work, coming to the state for medical treatment, following military orders, or traveling to work in federally-identified critical sectors. Governor Baker announced on August 7 that Massachusetts would postpone entering the second portion of phase three of the state's reopening plan, intensify enforcement of COVID-19 regulation violations, and reduce the limit on the number of people allowed at public and private outdoors events from 100 to 50. The changes were announced after several incidents in which large parties were found to be violating the state guidelines on the numbers of people allowed to gather, as well as on masks and physical distancing. Massachusetts school districts were required to submit their final plans for teaching in the fall, along with detailed safety protocols, by August 14. As of August 14, at least 32 of Massachusetts' 289 school districts had announced they would be teaching completely remotely to start the school year. Boston Public Schools announced on August 13 they had requested a waiver to delay the start of the school year from September 10 to September 21, saying they planned to use the time to provide training to staff. On August 21, after several weeks of pressure from the Boston Teacher's Union and other Massachusetts unions, BPS announced they would begin the school year remotely, with classes returning to in-person learning based on need beginning in October. Some colleges in Massachusetts began moving students in to dorms in mid-August. , students were beginning to move in to on-campus housing at Boston University in Boston and Clark University in Worcester. On August 19, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced that all children aged six months and older would need to receive a flu vaccine by December 31, 2020 in order to attend childcare, K‚Äì12 schools, and colleges and universities in the state. There is an allowance for medical or religious exemptions, and homeschooled K‚Äì12 students or higher education students who are not going on campus will not be required to receive the vaccination. This spurred some protests, including a rally of several hundred outside the State House on August 30, from parents and those who believed the decision was governmental overreach. In the Andover School District, which said it would start the year using a hybrid model of in-person and remote learning, teachers said they would only work remotely due to safety concerns. The Andover School Committee described the teachers' decision an \\"illegal work stoppage\\". When 45% of the members of the Andover Education Association refused to enter the building on August 31 for training, the Andover School Committee voted to take legal action against the educators. The teachers said they would \\"reluctantly\\" and \\"under duress\\" return to work, with the \\"hope that the School Committee will begin to negotiate reasonable health and safety benchmarks with us in good faith.\\"  September  On September 3, Governor Baker announced a community messaging campaign targeted towards Chelsea, Everett, Lawrence, Lynn, and Revere: communities that were still experiencing very high rates of COVID-19. By early September, some Massachusetts universities had received media attention when students disregarded social distancing rules imposed by the schools. In mid-August, more than 20 College of the Holy Cross students tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after partying off- campus in Worcester, Massachusetts. The school said the students who organized the party would be punished for breaking an agreement they had made before returning to school. Northeastern University announced on September 4 that they had dismissed eleven students caught violating social distancing rules within a day or two of many students moving in. Northeastern reported they would not be reimbursing the students' tuition or housing payments. Later in September, Middlebury College barred 22 students from campus for not following the campus COVID guidelines. Following seventeen cases of COVID-19 in one dorm, Merrimack College quarantined all 266 residents of the dorm. On September 29, Governor Baker announced that communities classified by the state as \\"lower risk\\" would be allowed to move into step two of the third phase of the state's reopening plan beginning on October 5. This step includes allowing both indoor and outdoor performance venues to open at 50% capacity (up to 250 people); fitting rooms to open in retail stores; and gyms, museums, libraries, and driving and flight schools to increase capacity to 50%. The Massachusetts Coalition for Health Equity criticized Baker's choice to continue reopening the state, citing concerns over increasing cases and positive test rates.  October  The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education announced on October 2 that they would begin providing weekly reports on the number of COVID-19 cases detected in schools. In the first report, covering the period from September 24 to September 30, 63 cases were found among students and 34 among staff. Student cases were spread across 41 districts, with Plymouth having the highest number with four cases reported. The Massachusetts Department of Health reported in early October that there had been outbreaks of COVID-19 at a substance abuse treatment center in Plymouth, as well as an outbreak at a correctional center in Middleton. Almost a third of the patient population of the Plymouth treatment facility tested positive, as did a dozen staff. On October 7, Boston Mayor Walsh announced that plans to allow additional students in the Boston Public School system to return to fully in-person or hybrid learning models would be further delayed after Boston's coronavirus positivity rate exceeded 4%. Also on October 7, Governor Baker announced his administration would be forming an advisory group to consult on plans to distribute a vaccine in Massachusetts when one is developed. On October 13, Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders announced at a press conference that they would be extending through December the \\"Stop the Spread\\" initiative, which provides free testing to high-risk communities.

He promulgated several measures bringing the Maronite Church in concert with Rome. Among the changes was the Church's switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, making the Maronites the first Eastern Church to make the move. Origins Ruzzi was from Bkoufa near Ehden in northern Mount Lebanon. He belonged to the Ruzzi family. His uncle Mikha'il served as patriarch of the Maronite Church from 1567 until his death in 1597. Patriarchate Ruzzi succeeded his uncle as patriarch after being elected in 1597. His election occurred during the visit of the papal emissary Girolamo Dandini who was sent to keep tabs on the Maronite Church's implementation of Roman Catholic reforms after reports that Mikha'il had Jacobite tendencies. According to the historian William Harris, Ruzzi ardently pursued papal practices, and the historian Pierre Dib considers him \\"a daring and resourceful man ... an inconsiderate Latinizer\\". In a council he held in the village of Moussa in 1598, he set out measures toward the Latinization of the Maronite Church. The following year Pope Clement VIII instructed Ruzzi to promulgate Latin marital rules in the Maronite Church; the marital rules relating to consanguinity, affinity, public honesty and spiritual relationship, did not take into effect until the late 19th century. Among the Latinization measures he implemented, Ruzzi revised fasting periods in accordance with Rome and removed a degree of Syriac from Maronite liturgy and ritual. Despite opposition from a significant proportion of the Maronites, he implemented the church's switch to the Gregorian calendar in 1606. The change was implemented successfully in Syria, but the Cypriot Maronites continued using the Julian calendar. Ruzzi's act made the Maronites the first Eastern Church to adopt the Gregorian calendar; the Syriacs and Chaldeans followed in 1836, the Melkites in 1857 and the Armenians in 1911. Not long after Ruzzi's act, in the 1600s, the Maronites discontinued counting the years from the Seleucid era in favor of the Christian era. Ruzzi died in March 1608. According to Dib, the measures implemented by Ruzzi were \\"harsh vexations\\" for the Maronites which prevented the election of a new patriarch until 16 October. Ruzzi's successor John Makhlouf criticized Ruzzi's reforms and expressed to Pope Paul V his desire to reestablish the ancient practices of the Maronite Church which were changed by Ruzzi to placate his religious subjects. Despite initial opposition, Ruzzi's changes became a permanent aspect of the Church. Ruzzi was influential with the Ottoman governor of Tripoli and Sunni Muslim local chieftain Yusuf Sayfa Pasha (intermittent ), whose jurisdiction spanned the predominantly Maronite districts of Byblos, Bsharri and Batroun in northern Mount Lebanon. The Patriarch frequently obtained orders of safe conduct from the Governor, who strove to win the support of his distrusting Maronite peasant subjects.

Todd McFarlane served as the series' creative director. The series was written by Jon Goff with art from Carlo Soriano and Crimelab Syndicate.  Summary  Rock star musician Yoshiki discovers super powers and turns into the Blood Red Dragon. He battles evil forces and assassins in the war with Oblivion, led by the mass murderer Ky'Rann the Slayer. Yoshiki is aided by the beautiful and deadly Shrine Maidens of the Dragon Temple.  Development  Yoshiki and Stan Lee met at a fundraiser in 2009. \\"He asked me what I do. I said rock star,\\" said Yoshiki. Then Yoshiki asked Lee what he did. He said, \\"I make superheroes.\\" Yoshiki responded with, \\"Great, are you going to make me a superhero someday?\\" Todd McFarlane joined the project as creative director. When developing Yoshiki's portrayal in the comic, McFarlane said \\"Yoshiki kind of flaunts his androgynousness. He was quick to point out that he didn‚Äôt want to be muscle- bound. When he turns into the dragon character, he didn‚Äôt want it to be like the Hulk. He wanted to be lean and mean.\\" Yoshiki oversaw the project's overall creative direction, and Jon Goff wrote the series's script based on a treatment from Lee. \\"Stan put together a treatment that established the groundwork for the story. This included a pretty thorough outline for the basic origin of the Blood Red Dragon and the threats he would face, as well as some very specific story beats that served as the foundation for some of the action set pieces. From there, Stan contacted Todd about developing the book further, with the express intent that Todd would help guide the visual sense and presentation of the story.\\"  Publication History  The project was first revealed at San Diego Comic Con in 2011. McFarlane announced that a limited edition run of issues would contain a sound chip to tie in to the music theme of the series. \\"We're going to be doing a musical comic book, like those musical cards you get at the Hallmark store. There will be a sound chip in the comic book so it plays a riff when you open it. Those are only going to be at Comic-Con.\\" Yoshiki and Lee appeared at New York Super Week in October 2014, sponsored by New York Comic Con, for a panel about Blood Red Dragon. The event was connected to X Japan's concert at Madison Square Garden that same week.  Reception  Alt Press named Blood Red Dragon in its 2020 list of \\"13 Comics Books That Would Make Incredible TV Series\\", saying that the series \\"simply kicked ass\\". IGN was disappointed in the simplistic story, claiming \\"In a book that should be pulsing with the layered complexity of X Japan's precise guitars, crushing drums, and soaring vocals, we get a no-frills story about a scant few mystically-powered heroes as humanity's only hope against an overwhelming evil horde.\\" References External links  Blood Red Dragon official website Category:Characters created by Stan Lee Category:Characters created by Todd McFarlane Category:Image Comics superheroes Category:Image Comics titles ","title":"Blood Red Dragon"},{"id":"64966456","text":"The 1977 Memphis State Tigers football team represented Memphis State University (now known as the University of Memphis) as an independent during the 1977 NCAA Division I football season.

Originally formed in 1749, the regiment would share roughly the same history of the L√©gion Royale, and become the 8√©me R√©giment de Chasseurs √† Cheval. The regiment's successor would continue to serve in the modern French Army through the Napoleonic Wars, Franco-Prussian War, and both World Wars until disbanding in 1959 after the disastrous Algerian War.  Formation  On 1 August 1749, the Volontaires de Flandre were formed through the grouping of the Arquebusiers de Grassin, formed in 1744, Fusiliers de La Morli√®re, formed on 16 October 1745, and Volontaires Bretons formed 20 August 1746. These formations were all formed in response to the call from Louis XV for free volunteers during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Invasion of the Low Countries.Susane, Volume II, Part II, pp. 103‚Äì107., 96‚Äì101. On formation after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle had fairly large numbers of 1,060 fusiliers (infantry) and 540 dragoons or hussars. The costumes of the volunteers were mixed due to the difference of the predecessors locations on formation. The first regular uniform arrived that next year, and consisted of the following; Blue coat jacket and lining with long pockets, white breeches, red cuffs and lapels, white buttons and buttonholes, and hat with silver edging.Lienhart & Humbert, Volume IV, pp. 66.  Seven Years' War  The corps was split in two on 1 April 1757 with accordance with the ordnance of 25 March at the start of the Seven Years' War forming the Voluntaires de Hainaut, each group now consisted of 6 companies of 70 infantry and of 30 cavalry. The Flanders volunteers would take part in every major campaign in Germany from 1757 to 1762 and stood out in the Battle of Hastenbeck and Battle of Corbach especially. The ordinance of 21 December 1762 transformed the corps into the L√©gion de Flanders and had the following composition; 2 companies of grenadiers, 12 mixed companies of 75 infantry and 50 dragoons, 2 companies of hussars, and 1 company of supporting staff (logistics, engineers, and bridging troops). The legion also absorbed part of the L√©gion de Dauphin√© into its ranks. The uniform then changed once again into; singular yellow costume lined with yellow, green collar lapels and facings, yellow jacket with green patlets on the sleeves, and white buttons. The mounted troops' costume was slightly different with yellow and edged with white braid.  Peacetime  After the Treaty of Paris, the legion having occupied the garrison of Givet in 1763, moved to Sarreguemines in 1764, to Vienne in 1765, Guise in 1766, Bourges in 1767, Montbrison in 1769, Puy in 1772, Strasbourg in 1775, and disbanded in Falaise. Uniform after the 1788 ordnance. Under the 1776 reformations, the legion's 8 infantry companies were separated to the infantry regiments to form their new Companie des ChasseursCompany of Chasseurs (Light Infantry), and the 8 dragoon companies transformed into 4 squadrons of chasseurs √† chevalMounted Chasseurs (Hunters), and attached to the La Reine, DAuphin, Monsieur, and Artois dragoon regiments. In 1778, a new ordnance was published and the chasseurs √† cheval companies removed from the dragoons to form a new designated chasseurs regiment. Therefore, in 1778 the four squadrons reformed the regiment to form the 2√©me R√©giment de Chasseurs √† Cheval. In 1779 the regiment moved to Toul, in 1780 to Vitry-sur-Seine, in 1782 to Maubeuge, and in 1784 to Guingamp. In 1779, following that years' uniform ordnance, all Chasseurs √† Cheval regiments were grouped into the same uniform scheme which consisted of a bicorne with a red plume attached to a bourbon white cockade. The 2nd Chasseurs (Pyrenees) uniform was as such; dark green collar, pink facings, turnbacks, and cuffs, pink trimmed green epaulettes, white breeches, black cavalry boots, dark green shabraque, and pink with white chained shabraque backgrounds. The typical loadout for a mounted chasseur consisted of a light cavalry sabre and carbine. These regiments were termed as light cavalry, but realistically were more affiliated with mounted rifles. The subsequent 1784 ordnance changed the white breeches and white shirt to peach coloured.Lienhart & Humbert, pp. 51‚Äì53. The ordnance of 8 May 1784 formed six battalions of Chasseurs √† PiedLiterally \\"Hunters of Foot\\"., each of four companies and attached each battalion to a regiment of Chasseurs √† Cheval, to form a light tactical brigade used for reconnaissance and rear-guards. Therefore, the mounted regiment was affiliated with a chasseurs battalion to form the Chasseurs √† Cheval des Pyr√©n√©es, and in 1788 was renamed to become the Chasseurs √† Cheval de Guyenne. Soon after its redesignation, a 5th squadron 5e Escadron was formed from troops of the Nassau, French-Comt√©, Septimanie, √âv√™ch√©s, and Quercy cavalry regiments. Under the 1 October 1786 ordnance, the regimental uniform was slightly altered so that the cap changed to a 'vertical bicorne' (in that it faced front to back instead of side to side), and the red plume changed to pink. In 1784 the regiment was in Guingamp, Pontivy, and Plo√´rmel, in 1785 to Philippeville, in 1786 to Puy, in 1788 to Saint-Avold, in 1789 to Sarrelouis, and in 1791 to Fort-Louis du Rhin where it was disbanded as a result of the French Revolution. Under the 17 March 1788 ordnance, the regimental uniform changed back to the old style bicorne with a pink plume, and the shirt changed back to white. As per royal decision on 1 December 1789, the regimental uniform was again slightly altered so that the bicorne plume became a feathered plume of pink, and the shirt changed to dark green. In 1791 the regiment was renamed to the 8√©me R√©giment des Chasseurs √† Cheval, and the royalist lineage ended.Smith, p. 49.

Her autobiographical children's novel, Miss Ulysses of Puka-Puka (1948), was the first published literary work by a Pacific Islander woman author. Biography Frisbie was born in Papeete, Tahiti, the second child of American writer Robert Dean Frisbie and Ngatokura ‚ÄòA Mata‚Äôa. In 1934 the family moved to Ngatokura's home of Pukapuka in the Cook Islands, where Frisbie was raised. As a child she helped her father type up his writings and kept a journal in Pukapukan, Cook Islands MƒÅori, and English, which she learned from her father's library and from comic books. Following the death of her mother in 1939 the family left Pukapuka and travelled to Manihiki and Rarotonga before settling on Suwarrow in January 1942. Later that year the atoll was hit by a tropical cyclone which washed away 16 of its 22 islets; the Frisbies survived by tying themselves to trees and taking shelter in a tree house. The family continued to travel around the South Pacific until her father's death of tetanus in 1948. During this time, Frisbie published Miss Ulysses of Puka-Puka, dealing with her life on the atoll and her bond with her father and family. Following her father's death, the family was split up to be raised by friends and relatives of her father in New Zealand and Hawaii. In 1950 Florence moved to O‚Äòahu to be raised by the Engle family. She attended Punahou School in Honolulu, and after graduating the author James A. Michener encouraged her to take a job in Japan as a secretary in the military. In 1956 she married TV personality Carl 'Kini Popo' Hebenstreit. In 1959 she published a biography of her family, The Frisbies of the South Seas. They subsequently moved to New Zealand, where Frisbie lived for thirty years, working for the University of Otago and writing children's books. After her husband acquired a commercial radio licence she became involved in commercial radio, and then in television, working with Selwyn Toogood as a panelist on the New Zealand version of Beauty and the Beast. She served on the MƒÅori and South Pacific Arts Council and was later a founding member of P.A.C.I.F.I.C.A. She subsequently returned to the Cook Islands, and then Hawaii. In 2015 Frisbie returned to Pukapuka to film a documentary about life on the atoll.

Shrines are so set up that devotees can see the shrines of Shiva from Theradi Vinayaka, Kala Bairava from Muruga and Mahalakshmi from Perumal. History Once Kamadhenu had to face the wrath of Indra, and got a curse. In order to get rid from the curse she asked the advice of Kapila Munivar. He, in turn, advised her to keep her two ears filled with water and to worship Shiva. While she was practising it daily, Shiva in order to test her came in the guise of a tiger and told her that he would kill. Later Shiva, along with his consort gave darshan to her. She got rid out of the curse. Festivals Maha Sivaratri, Margazhi Tiruvathirai, Karthikai, and Panguni Uthiram, Vaikasi visakam (10 days) and Thaipusam are held in this temple. ‡Æ§‡Øà‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÇ‡Æö‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æï‡Øã‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æ±‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡Æµ‡Æ¥‡Æø‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ, ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ©‡ÆÆ‡Æ£‡Æø, 22 ‡Æö‡Æ©‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Æø 2019 References Category:Hindu temples in Pudukkottai district Category:Shiva temples in Pudukkottai district ","title":"Vyagrapurisvarar Temple, Thiruvengaivasal"},{"id":"64966992","text":"The 1958 Special Honours in New Zealand were two special honours lists in which 26 New Zealanders were awarded the Polar Medal.

About the region The Cascade-Sierra provincen stretchs approximately from the high desert region of the Mohave Desert in Southern California to just north of the border between British Columbia and the state of Washington.Fenneman, Nevin. (1928). Physiographic Divisions of the United States. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 18(4), 261-353. Retrieved August 17, 2020. The region is extremely diverse geologically and ecologically and is commonly divided into two regions: the Cascade Mountains and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This province is part of a larger physiographic region that extends from Alaska in the north to the southern tip of South America. Several tectonic plates meet and form this region and make it one of the most geologically active places in North America. The province is home to several national forests, including the Lassen, Modoc, and Plumas National Forests. The Modoc Plateau, an area of high elevation basalt flows between the Medicine Lake Highlands and the Warner Mountains, is also within the region. The ecology of the province is extremely diverse and contains areas of pine, aspen, and cypress forests, mixed conifer and evergreen forests, along with montane meadows, fens, mammoth granite outcroppings, vernal pools, and sagebrush flats. Cascade Mountain Range The Cascade Mountains form the northern portion of the Cascade-Sierra province. The Cascades were created from thousands of small, short-lived volcanoes along the Cascadia subduction zone that over millions of years built a foundation of lava and volcanic debris on which the mountains rise. This range includes thirteen major volcanic centers and are part of the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire. The two most recent eruptions are the Mount Lassen eruptions from 1914 to 1921, and the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980. Sierra Nevada Mountain Range The Sierra Nevada Mountains form the southern portion of the Cascade-Sierra province. Like the Cascade Range, the Sierra Nevada Range formed from a chain of volcanoes along a subduction zone. However unlike the Cascade volcanoes, those that formed the Sierra Nevada Range are long extinct and buried deep within the earth forming a bed of solidified lava that is responsible for the gray granitic rocks of the Sierra. One of the best known areas in the Sierra Nevada range is Yosemite National Park. Further reading * Hill, M. (1975). Geology of the Sierra Nevada. Berkeley: University of California Press. * Hill, R.

Prof. Goswami has demonstrated near-IR rapid Femtosecond Laser pulse shaping in the Megahertz repetition domain, which is the current state of the art metric for the generation of shaped laser pulses. This latest demonstration of rapid near-IR femtosecond pulse shaping is based on his original approach of Fourier Transform Femtosecond Pulse Shaping that utilizes a programmable traveling wave grating in an acousto-optic modulator. Pushing the limits of current technology and the realization of improved standards of experimentation has been a coherent part of his research narrative. His approach to Femtosecond pulse shaping has been crucial for applications from the demonstration of control in the gas phase fragmentation reactions to 2D IR spectroscopy and quantum computing . His work has built upon a history of over thirty years of working on pulsed laser experiments and has established other milestones in the field. He developed the self-calibrated femtosecond optical tweezers method for reproducible pulsed laser optical tweezers experiments with an additional forced oscillatory mode of motion. He went on to use the femtosecond optical tweezers to provide a direct measure and control of 'in situ' temperature and viscosity at micro-scale volumes . He used this method to directly detect colloidal assembly, their structure, and orientation , which affirmed the spatiotemporal aspects of the method. Breaking the barrier of programmable pulsed laser generation has been concomitant to his insights into the theoretical aspects of pulsed light and heat dissipation dynamics. His work on the cumulative thermal effects of femtosecond infra-red lasers, has revolutionized the existing framework of laser heat dissipation. This has in turn been shown to be the key to mitigating the deleterious effect of heat accumulation during sensitive measurements of nonlinear optical properties. Further, this led to the first demonstration of the hitherto unexplored distinction between molecular structures with femtosecond laser-induced thermal spectroscopy. Femtosecond thermal spectroscopy with infra-red lasers has thus become a new spectroscopic identification method. In more direct applications of the experimental framework driving his work, he has demonstrated how to distinguish overlapping fluorophores in multi-photon imaging microscopy using near-IR high repetition rate femtosecond lasers by exploiting repeated excitation and de-excitation processes that help to distinguish and eventually eliminate abnormal cells from healthy ones .

It broadcast from 1936 to 1997, having been the first station established in New London, and was last owned by Hall Communications. Early years WNLC signed on September 13, 1936. Originally broadcasting on 1500 kHz with 100 watts during the daytime only, WNLC was owned by the Thames Broadcasting Corporation and built by Daniel E. Noble, an engineer who had built WCAC, an early educational station at the University of Connecticut; the transmitter was grounded to the nearby railroad tracks. Original studios were in the Mohican Hotel with transmitter at Winthrop Point. It was the first radio station in the state east of the Connecticut River. The station maintained affiliations with the Mutual Broadcasting System and the regional Yankee and Colonial networks. The 1938 New England hurricane slammed into New London with force. It knocked WNLC off the air for three weeks and crumpled its tower, while storm surge battered the transmitter building and washed out the front and back walls. The station continued to operate from its studios in the Mohican Hotel, broadcasting news on the hotel's speaker. The station was able to return to the air when a shortwave transmitter for WOR arrived, fed by DC power from the hotel; other outlets in the region also aided in restoring operations. The station was permitted to operate at night in 1939 and with 250 watts in 1940; NARBA reallocation moved it and other stations on 1500 to 1490 kHz effective March 29, 1941. In 1944, Jim Gordon, later a news and sportscaster in New York, started his radio career at WNLC. WNLC was prepared to move from the world of radio to television. In 1952‚Äîafter applying for TV channel 26‚ÄîGerald J. Morey, executive of Thames, disclosed that in the preceding years, the station had planned for potential television facilities with an audio chain ready for television, a partly built FM radio site on Raymond Hill, and sufficient studio space. The television station, however, was never built, and in November 1956, the Federal Communications Commission ordered WNLC and a string of other permittees for unbuilt UHF outlets to build or lose their permits. Instead, Morey focused on improving the WNLC AM facility, especially after WSUB (980 AM) went on the air from nearby Groton in 1957. In August 1958, it filed to move to 1510 kHz, relocate its transmitter, and broadcast with 5,000 watts; the FCC granted the application in November 1960. The frequency change cleared the way for a new station to open at Greenwich on 1490. The new facility was highly directional to the southeast, operating from an eight-tower array; four towers were used in daytime operation and six at night. A second boost, this time to a daytime power of 10,000 watts, took place in 1964. WNLC got a sister FM station on December 29, 1969, when WTYD (100.9 FM) began broadcasting. New owners, new formats After nearly 40 years under the same ownership that had founded the station in 1936, WNLC-WTYD entered into negotiations in 1975 to sell the Mercury Broadcasting Corporation, based in Maryland. The sale was triggered because 60-year-old Gerald Morey, who had founded the station when he was 20, was in poor health. Thames sold the stations to Mercury the next year for $1.1 million. While the FM continued with its beautiful music programming, WNLC's musical programming shifted from Top 40 toward adult contemporary. One night in 1977, the station went off the air for two hours as a safety precaution while rescue workers sought to talk a 30-year-old man who made a living building and painting radio towers from committing suicide by jumping off the mast. WNLC was sold twice in a five-year span in the 1980s. Norman Drubner, a real estate investor from Waterbury, bought it and WTYD from Mercury in 1984. Two years later, Drubner sold WNLC and WTYD to Andross Communications for $5.2 million; by this time, the AM station was airing an oldies format, with the adult contemporary sound having moved to WTYD. The pair changed hands one more time, in 1994, when Hall Communications of Norwich purchased the stations for $3.5 million, adding to the two stations it already owned in Norwich. Closure and move of WNLC to FM In its final years of operation, WNLC aired an adult standards format, after having flipped to news/talk prior to the Hall acquisition. In late 1997, however, Hall opted to move WNLC and its standards programming to the FM band. It did so by acquiring WXZR (98.7 FM), a satellite-fed Z Rock station, for $2 million; that September, WXZR became WNLC-FM. Hall then took the AM facility silent in an attempt to repair the eight-tower directional array at Waterford, which had been malfunctioning since a 1997 fire. The call letters on the facility were changed to WWJY. In April, Hall surrendered its nighttime operating authority, which would have left the station a daytime-only outlet using three of the eight towers. However, it never returned to operation, and it was deleted.

A forest road (north-south direction) serves the west side of this valley and another on the east side; these roads connect to the south the coastal road of the island (east-west direction). These roads are mainly used for forestry and recreational tourism activities. Forestry is the main economic activity in this area, particularly through Anticosti National Park which covers the upper part of the river; recreational tourism activities, second.Geonames Map - Chicotte River  Geography  The Chicotte River draws its source from a mountain stream (altitude: ), located in the south-central part of the island. This source is located in a forest area at: * east of the town center of the village of Port-Menier; * south of the north shore of Anticosti Island; * northeast of the south shore of Anticosti Island. From its source, the Chicotte River descends between the Rivi√®re aux Rats (located on the west side) and the Rivi√®re aux Plats (east side).

Biography  He was a student of Francesco Casanova and Louis-Gabriel Moreau. After working as a landscape painter in several countries; including Italy, where he probably lived in Rome from 1780 to 1785, he returned to France, but was there for only a short time before the outbreak of the Revolution. At some point in 1790, he moved to London, where he exhibited at the Royal Academy and created works intended for making into prints. Hearing about the opportunities available for painters in Russia, he attempted to emigrate there via Finland, but was stymied by Russia's involvement in the war against France. He finally settled in Stockholm in 1798, where he quickly established himself; becoming a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and winning an appointment as a court painter. He painted in oils and gouache, with motifs from all the places he had visited, and was especially known for his dramatic scenes with rocks and waterfalls. For many years, he was planning a large album to be called Voyage pittoresque de la Su√®de, that would present all of his best landscapes in aquatint, working in conjunction with a now little-known artist named Louis J. A. Cordier de Bonneville (1766-1843). Ultimately, only nineteen were engraved and included in a book with seven works by . Later, some of his works would be engraved by James Merigot.

Signed orders for a broad scope of issues were drafted and signed by the president intended to be used to prevent disruption of government functions. Only a very limited number of PEADs are public knowledge, and only through secondary declassified documents that mention them. Of these the trend of the orders is toward a severe reduction of liberty and civil rights for American citizens. Thorson,763 No PEADs have been declassified, however they are referenced in FBI memorandums that were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, agency manuals, and court records.https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential- emergency-powers/576418/ The fact that these orders are classified, none have ever been publicly released or leaked, and are therefore obscure and generally unknown to average Americans and scholars and even Executive branch officials, they are some times referred to as \\"secret powers\\" of the President.

Of these orders there were plans for relocating centers for government functions and suspending habeas corpusThorson,763. They even called for the creation of new government agencies to be chaired by a mixture of both civilian businessmen and cabinet secretaries without any scope of their exact function or lifespan, the only focus being on their activation on the day of a nuclear attack. These new agencies included: The Office of Censorship, National Manpower Agency, and National Food Agency. These agencies were authorized to \\"requisition or condemn private property or its use,\\" pursuant to act of Congress and/or executive order, and it was thought this would be necessary to rebuild the country and maintain law and order. Conaty,673 Over time, the circumstances under which PEADs could be executed expanded to include events beyond nuclear warfare. One example is a 1968 FBI Memorandum from the Johnson Administration. The memorandum recommended a \\"Priority Apprehension Program based on dangerousness[sic] of individuals on SI\\" referring to the government \\"Security Index,\\" and noting that the government had \\"recently amended [its] definition of a dangerous person in new Presidential Emergency Action Document 6, broadening it to include terrorists or persons who would interfere with Government operation and defense effort [sic]\\".Hobson v.

Thorson, 765 No memoranda that are more recent than 1979 have been found that contain references to PEADs. However, CNN reported in 1991 that the Reagan administration had continued COG planning and revealed plans drafted by then Vice President George H. W.

The rail trail is 9.9 miles long and goes from Lowellville to Union Township in Lawrence County, traveling directly through Lowellville. It was constructed on the former Penn-Ohio Electric System trolley line along the Mahoning River in 1983, adjacent to the CSX New Castle Subdivision tracks. Considered an early example of rail-trails, it's 1983 construction was dependent on a donation from the Stavich family, who ran many aluminum mills in the Youngstown area.  History  From the late 19th century through the 1940s, it was very common to find streetcars and trolleys throughout much of Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio. Originally, many of these streetcar lines were built by numerous companies, but merged into the Mahoning & Shenango Railway and Light System in 1905. The company changed its name to the Penn-Ohio Electric System in 1920. The company provided service through much of the area known as the Mahoning Valley, having both local streetcar lines and interurban trolleys. The main line, between New Castle and Youngstown, opened in 1902. Part of that line is now the Stavich Bike Trail. The Penn-Ohio trolley system began its downfall once the rise of the automobile began, as well as the Great Depression. Ridership reportedly fell by 45% between 1930 and 1931. This caused the main line to be converted to buses between 1931 and 1932, the first in the Penn-Ohio system to do so. Subsequently, numerous other interurban trolleys and local streetcars in the Mahoning Valley were converted to buses. The last of which to be converted were the local streetcars in New Castle, which were converted to buses in 1941, forming the Shenango Valley Transportation Company.  Bicycle trail  In 1983, thanks to a donation from the Stavich family, who were a local aluminum tycoon, construction commenced on the nearly 10-mile long trail between the two cities. It opened later that year. Since then, numerous emergency repairs have had to be completed on the trail after intense Spring storms wash parts of the trail away. Additionally, the Lawrence County Department of Planning & Community Development has proposed new trails connecting to Stavich Bike Trail in its 2017 Greenways Plan. One of which includes improving the trail connection from the Stavich Bike Trail to Downtown New Castle. The department's ideal option is to create a separate trail option into the city along Penn Power's right-of-way. It also plans for improvements at the crossing at Covert Road, which was identified as the most dangerous along the trail. Another proposed route continues the trail along the CSX railroad tracks info Mahoningtown, although this is a lower priority to the downtown connection.

Native Tongue Title is the enactment of a statute-based,Dr Anna Goldsworthy on the Barngarla language reclamation, The Monthly, September 2014 ex gratia financial compensation scheme - to cover efforts to resuscitate a heritage tongue that was killed (for example, due to colonization), or to empower an endangered one.Why we should revive dead languages, by Ghil‚Äòad Zuckermann, OUPBlog, June 20, 2020. Origin The term was coined by linguist and revivalist Ghil'ad Zuckermann.Indigenous meanings of Australian town names, Sophie Verass, NITV, August 11, 2016.One Israeli's Mission to Revive Aboriginal Language Down Under, Haaretz, March 20, 2016. He modelled it on the pre-existent Australian term Native Title, which refers to the common law doctrine according to which the land rights of Indigenous peoples persist after the assumption of sovereignty under settler colonialism. Native Tongue Title vs Native Title Zuckermann argues that despite Native Title, and although some Australian states have enacted ex gratia compensation schemes for the victims of the Stolen Generations policies, the victims of linguicide are overlooked. He proposes that existing competitive grant schemes by the Australian Government to support Australian Aboriginal languages should be complemented with compensation schemes, which are based on a claim of right rather than on competition. Nonetheless, anthropologist Timothy Haines argues that \\"Zuckermann's remarkable achievement\\" of reclaiming the Barngarla language \\"arguably assisted in the process of the recognition of the Barngarla people's native title. Indeed, the Federal Court judge presiding over the Barngarla's native title hearing, Justice John Mansfield noted that the Barngarla's active pursuit of language revival ‚Äî empowered by Zuckermann's renewed ‚Äúrevivalist‚Äù efforts ‚Äî was a clear indication of their continued connection with their land and culture. This was despite the separation that many had endured as ‚ÄúStolen Generation‚Äù children of the 1960s and 70s, when they were forcibly removed by the State to homes in Adelaide, far distant from their native Eyre Peninsula in South Australia's west.\\" References Category:Linguistics Category:Native Tongues Posse ","title":"Native Tongue Title"},{"id":"64967626","text":"The United Kingdom (green) and India (orange) Numerous United Kingdom‚ÄìIndia bus routes ran from the 1950s to the 1970s. The first of these was \\"The Indiaman\\", a service from London to Calcutta that was inaugurated on 15 April 1957. At least 32 other operators ran services, including Albert Travel which ran 15 round journeys from London to India with onward connections to Australia. Overland routes were made difficult by political unrest in the Middle East during the 1970s and ended with the 1979 Iranian Revolution and Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. The Albert bus was refurbished from 2009 and made a one-off return trip from the UK to Australia in 2012. In 2020 Adventures Overland announced they would inaugurate a New Delhi‚ÄìLondon bus journey via China from 2021.  Indiaman  A 1948 AEC Regal III The first UK‚ÄìIndia bus service was \\"The Indiaman\\", run by Garrow-Fisher Tours, based in London. This left Victoria Coach Station on 15 April 1957 and returned after a journey to Calcutta on 2 August. The journey, which was covered by The New York Times, was eventful with driver Oswald-Joseph Garrow-Fisher recalling the road passing over high cliffs near Mount Ararat Turkey-Soviet Union border, soft verges in India, and needing to use planks under the wheels to escape the desert sand in Iran. On the return leg the 1957‚Äì1958 influenza pandemic forced the closure of the Pakistan-Iran border. The tour diverted from the border to the city of Karachi, intending to find passage on a ship, but upon reaching the port they learned the land border had reopened and so returned that way, a diversion of some . The British embassy in Tehran had heard a rumour that the passengers had been murdered en route and were so relieved when they arrived unharmed that they hosted a cocktail party in their honour. The Indiaman was a 1948 AEC Regal III. Garrow-Fisher refurbished the 33-seater bus, that already had on its odometer, for the journey. In its transcontinental configuration it could carry 24 passengers plus luggage. For the first journey, Garrow-Fisher charged ¬£85 for the outbound fare and ¬£65 for the return; 20 passengers were carried to India and 7 made the return journey. Passengers slept overnight in hotels or camped outside. One passenger, Peter Moss, wrote an account of the journey that was published in book-form as The Indiaman ‚Äì When the Going was Good by Land and Sea. The Indiaman made four return journeys in total.  Albert  An Albion Venturer A bus named \\"Albert\\" was run by Albert Travel from May 1968. The venture was started by British travel agent and Australian resident Andy Stewart who purchased a 1947 Albion Motors CS Venturer double- decker bus from the New South Wales Department of Government Transport; the bus had previously operated the number 2004 service in Sydney. Stewart managed to reduce the asking price from AU$1000 to AU$400 as the bus was not capable of going above and had a large dent in the rear. He fitted it out with bunk beds to suit 14 passengers, extra fuel tanks and drinking water supply. There was also heating in the lower deck, a radio and cassette player, a reading and dining saloon and a kitchen with a gas cooker and sink. Starting in Australia (the bus transferred by ship to India) Stewart drove 13 passengers on the first trip to London. He made a further 14 round trips between 1968 and 1975, when political instability in Iran forced him to stop. A typical route ran from Victoria Coach Station via Belgium, West Germany, Austria, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, West Pakistan to India where it stopped at New Delhi, Agra, Allahabad, Banaras and Calcutta. Until 1970 the bus was shipped from Calcutta to Sydney, thereafter the bus ran to Calcutta from which passengers could chose to fly across Burma to Bangkok, Thailand and continue by train through Malaysia to Singapore where a boat would carry them to Perth or Sydney, Australia. The bus stopped en route to allow passengers to visit sites of interest and local shops. In the early years a one-way ticket was ¬£85, this rose to ¬£125 by the early 1970s excluding catering. The connection via Singapore to Australia was a further ¬£125. The trip was advertised as \\"the world's longest bus route\\" and \\"your complete home while you travel\\". Stewart returned to Australia as a travel agent after making the last trip to London. He retired back to the UK and, in 2001, tracked down the Albert bus which was in Brighton. He purchased the vehicle in 2009 and renovated it to make a return journey overland to Australia. He raised funds by selling shares at ¬£250 each, with the owners of ten or more shares being entitled to a seat on the trip. The journey was completed in 2012 and the bus remains in Australia making appearances at car shows.  Other operators  In the decade following the inauguration of the Indiaman at least 32 operators arranged bus trips between the UK and India. These included the Waltzing Matilda, Topdeck Travel, Swagman Tour's Asian Greyhound, Tentrek Expeditions, King Kong, Crazy Bus, Penn Overland and No Sweat Overland Tours. Vehicles varied from double decker buses to converted fire engines and typically took 20 days each way. Penn Travel had a \\"Marco Polo Tour\\" route than ran from London to Kathmandu over 72 days and some of the companies would also arrange hotels en route and broker visas for their passengers. Eastbound travellers were usually westerners seeking adventure while westbound travellers were often economic migrants from the Punjab. Operators claimed cultural differences and difficulties at the border crossings made westbound trips more troublesome and charged an additional ¬£20 for these. At least one driver insisted on being armed for all westbound journeys. The closure of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in 1978 meant some journeys had to be completed by air and the overland routes became completely untenable following the 1979 Iranian Revolution and Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War.  2021 revival  In 2020 it was announced that the Indian travel operator Adventures Overland, inspired by the Hippie Trail, would inaugurate a new bus service from Delhi to London in May 2021. This would run through 18 countries including Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, China, Russia, and Belgium. A one-way trip would cost 1.5 million rupees (circa ¬£15,320) and take 70 days to cover the route. The bus would carry 20 passengers.

The leaves may include gotukola, karapincha, welpenela, iramusu, hatawariya, polpala, karapincha or ranawara, depending upon the type of ailment that is being sought to prevent or cure. It is usually served at breakfast, steaming hot, with a piece of jaggery (palm sugar) to counter the bitterness of the herbal leaves. According to ancient texts, including the Dƒ´pava·πÉsa and MahƒÅva·πÉsa, the habit of consuming Kola kanda originated with the Buddhist culture. It is eaten by Buddhist monks in the morning, as a means of sustenance. As part of the Buddhist monastic code, monks are only permitted two meals a day (breakfast and lunch) and following a period of not consuming any solid food since lunch the previous day Kola kanda provides the monks with the necessary restoration and rejuvenation to commence their daily activities. Ingredients The oldest recorded recipe for Kol kanda mentions the following ingredients and their amounts * Red rice - one fistful per person * gotukola - roughly chopped - one fistful * Grated coconut - one fistful * Water * Ginger - one to two slices - finely chopped * Garlic - six gloves - finely chopped * Salt - as required for taste Preparation The red rice is ground on a grindstone until broken into smaller pieces, the selected herb is also ground in a similar manner until the juice is extracted. Approximately three cups of water are added to the broken rice grains and boiled,and then milk obtained from the grated coconut and garlic is added. The mixture is stirred until the rice becomes soft. The herbal extract is added last with salt and removed from the heat to avoid destroying the nutrients from the herbs.

She maintained a large household and one duty of her footmen was to bring her the latest news as soon as it arrived by mail coach. The mail coach used the road in front of Brook House and Stanley paid the guard five shillings a time to fire his pistol when passing to alert her servants of important news. A footman would then run to the inn in town to retrieve the news. She maintained a sedan chair, cheaper than a horse and carriage and better suited to Knutsford's narrow streets. Considered an important and influential figure in Knutsford, Stanley was also well liked by her servants and neighbours. Ellis Chadwick, writing in 1910, noted \\"she had very strict notions of propriety and of the courtesies of life, and would not have them infringed\\". She firmly believed in her right, as a gentlewoman, to walk closest to the wall on the town's footpaths (ie the side away from the kerb). On one occasion when a man walking in the other direction chose to keep to the wall she rapped him on the shoulder with her gold-topped cane and told him \\"whenever you meet a lady - always give her the wall\\". Stanley was disappointed when her brother, Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, chose to marry the actress Elizabeth Farren in 1797. Henry Green, a local history writer, noted that she \\"disliked to see men and women linked together\\" (i.e., walking arm in arm). Stanley donated money throughout her life to construct and maintain footpaths in the town but specified that they be no more than a single flagstone in width to prevent couples from walking together. She also donated a woollen flag to the town that was flown from the church at times of military victories or other national rejoicings. Two portraits of her are known, one as a young child, and one of her in old age that she sent to Edward, Lord Stanley, her brother's son. Stanley died in Knutsford and was buried in Great Budworth, Cheshire. It is thought that she chose to be buried there rather than the family plot in Ormskirk, Lancashire, to avoid her remains being close to those of Farren. Shortly before she died Stanley composed her own epitaph: \\"A maid I lived and a maid I died; I never was asked and never denied\\".  Legacy  Stanley's sedan chair in use for the Royal May Day festival circa 1900 Stanley left significant bequests as well as a ¬£6,000 inheritance to her family. Two senior female servants each received ¬£600 and all others with at least 3-years service received a full year's wages. A donation of ¬£500 was made for the upkeep of the elderly and disabled in three local parishes and gifts of between ¬£50 and ¬£500 were made to 21 local women, which she specified was to be spent at their sole discretion \\"independent of, and free from the debts, power or control of her husband, or future husband\\". Stanley left sums of between ¬£500 and ¬£1,250 for infirmaries in Liverpool, Manchester, Chester and Bath, mental hospitals in Liverpool and Manchester, an asylum for the blind in Liverpool, a maternity hospital in Manchester and to the Philanthropic Society of St George for the promotion of industry and reform of criminals. A sum of ¬£400 was left to be used to repair and improve the footpaths she had laid out around Knutsford and to maintain the woollen church flag. This was invested in Consolidated Bank annuities, that generated a return of around 3% per year (¬£12) by the 1820s. The pavements were maintained, more or less unchanged, until 2014 when Cheshire East Council found them to be unsafe for the disabled. A project was begun to improve and widen the footpaths. Stanley's sedan chair has been used by the annual Knutsford Royal May Day procession since 1884. Stanley was the inspiration for the Honourable Mrs Jamieson in Elizabeth Gaskell's 1849 novel Cranford and the title character in her 1858 My Lady Ludlow, both based on her time in Knutsford.

ASR initially focused on desktop audio equipment such as digital- to-analog converters (DACs) and headphone amplifiers. Testing has since expanded into many other kinds of home audio and professional audio equipment, provided largely by forum members and some manufacturer submissions. Testing uses industry standard electronic test and analysis equipment. Audio equipment testing using measurements-based methods is contentious.

He is particularly known for his work to build networks connecting the non-profit sector and for assisting developing countries to establish network connectivity. Education Jensen grew up in Johannesburg in South Africa. He studied biology at Queen's University Belfast from 197680 and, as a post-graduate at the University of Guelph in Canada, specialized in acid-rain pollution research. However, he began to question the value of writing scientific papers that seemed to have little impact on policy making. At that time the Reagan administration in the USA was denying the linkage between pollution and acid rain and Jensen started to write about pollution for student newspapers. After receiving his MSc he returned to South Africa and was, for a time, a technology journalist on the anti-apartheid Rand Daily Mail. Early innovations When the Rand Daily Mail closed down in 1985 due to its inability to attract advertisers as a paper that targeted both black and white readers, Jensen decided to emigrate to Canada. In 1982, while studying for his MSc, he had been introduced to the CoSy online messaging system. CoSy was being developed by the University of Guelph and was subsequently selected in 1985 by Byte magazine for that magazine's BYTE Information eXchange, a networked bulletin board. While he waited in Toronto for his Canadian immigration clearance in 1986, Jensen opened a computer account at the University of Toronto that was using Usenet newsgroups for online discussions and information sharing. He had started volunteering with the Ontario Environmental Network (OEN) and wondered whether something similar to Usenet could be put together for environmental groups. Jensen set up a multi-user network for the OEN, using a cheap personal computer and a PC-based version of the Unix operating system, thereby offering the potential for cheaper internet access than that provided by commercial mainframe systems. Together with Kirk Roberts, he founded an Internet service provider for the non-profit sector, known as \\"The Web\\". Subsequently called Web Networks, ‚ÄúThe Web‚Äù predated the World Wide Web by three years and provided cheaper internet access for NGOs than any commercial systems available at the time. The emergence of similar movements elsewhere, such as the Institute for Global Communications (IGC Internet) in California and GreenNet in London, led to the formation of an International NGO computer network. Web Networks was a founding member of the Association for Progressive Communications (APC), established in 1992, which provides ICT policy advice and support for non-profits and similar groups and with which Jensen continues to maintain close contact. In the early days of internet, technicians had to travel to install software and to programme code to allow different systems to communicate with each other. Jensen was one of several who travelled extensively to install software and work with local technicians to link NGO networks to APC, using a \\"mother system\\" based on that in use at IGC Internet. He worked with Pegasus Networks in Australia, and with Micro-computing for Non-Governmental Organizations (MANGO) in southern Africa, where he started to use the Fidonet bulletin-board system, which proved effective to use with the poor phone lines available in much of Africa. This innovation then took him to GreenNet in London in order to upgrade the APC system to enable the smaller NGOs using Fidonet to gateway with the APC hosts, allowing them to use directly email services and information newsgroups offered by APC members. He then returned to South Africa to install a gateway at WorkNet, the South Africa APC partner that had been set up in 1987. By the end of 1991, Jensen and others had helped join seven African countries to the APC network. Subsequent career Jensen then worked in other African countries to provide advice to development agencies, such as NGOs, governments, and the private sector in the development of ICT projects. His activities, which have taken him to over 45 countries in Africa and elsewhere, have ranged from ICT policy development at the national level to international fibre and rural wireless telecommunication feasibility studies. His clients have included the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the UK Department for International Development, the World Food Programme, and the Global Libraries initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He has also worked with the Internet Society and with the Association for Progressive Communications (APC) as Access Specialist, responsible for coordinating policy, research, advocacy, capacity building, and communications on access. He was a member of the African Conference of Ministers' High-Level Working Group, which developed the African Information Society Initiative (AISI). He has provided advice on cross-border fibre provision in Africa and, more recently, has carried out studies of national broadband deployment in Brazil and a study of the benefits of promoting infrastructure-sharing to lower the cost of access. He has also developed national analog-to-digital TV migration strategies. Internet Hall of Fame In 2017 Jensen, was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame as a \\"Global Connector\\". In 2012 he had served as a member of the Advisory Board to choose the first inductees to the Hall of Fame, who included Al Gore, Tim Berners-Lee, Linus Torvalds and Jimmy Wales. Publications Jensen's publications include: *The community telecentre cookbook for Africa: Recipes for self-sustainability. 2001. *Promoting the Use of Internet Exchange Points: A Guide to Policy, Management, and Technical Issues. 2012. *Towards financial sustainability in community-based networks. 2018.

While jailed for a robbery charge, he confessed to the murders and was later sentenced to 94 years imprisonment. Murders The first victim was 42-year-old Denise Marie Harris (no relation), whom DeWayne met on First Avenue in downtown Seattle. Along with an unnamed accomplice, they strangled Denise with a belt, removing some of her clothing and then binding her hands and ankles with shoelaces. He also stuffed a brassiere in her mouth. Harris' body was then dumped in the \\"Jungle\\", an underdeveloped plot of land under the I-5 and I-90 freeways. Denise's body was found on September 12th by a homeless man wandering the area. Not long after, Harris picked up 33-year-old Antoinette Jones. He accused her of stealing drugs from him, and proceeded to strangle her with a leather belt. Like Denise, he then bound her wrists and ankles with shoelaces, wrapping an additional shoelace around her neck. Her body was dumped in the Jungle, where her skeletal remains were found on February 1, 1998, about half a mile from where Harris was found. Forensic tests proved that she had been there for at least three months. The last victim was 25-year-old Olivia Smith, whose date of death is uncertain. After picking her up from an apartment building at Airport Way South, Harris and Smith engaged in a violent argument about exchanging drugs for sex, after which DeWayne took out a knife and stabbed her numerous times and slashed her throat. He left the body on the scene, where it was discovered on the stairwell on January 10, 1998. Arrest, trial and imprisonment Some time after the murders, Harris was jailed for an unrelated robbery charge. While in jail, around April 1998 he phoned a detective and told him that he was responsible for the deaths of three prostitutes, claiming that it was his 'hobby' and he got a thrill out of doing it. Shortly after his confession, he charged with all three murders, and was detained at the King County jail on $5 million bail. At his trial, Harris, strapped in a restraining chair because of his unruly behavior, was described as a cunning and manipulative predator who preyed on vulnerable women. According to his attorney, John Hicks, his only reason for confessing was that he \\"wanted Seattle to recognize there was a serial killer.\\" He was found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 94 years imprisonment, and upon hearing the verdict, he dropped his head backwards and started to laugh, much to the courtroom's shock. For his final words before the court, Harris told the King County Superior Court Judge Marsha Pechman that there were more like him out there, and that nobody was safe, even in their own homes and apartments. He also added that there was no true justice, as he was still living and breathing, and had certain privileges in prison. Upon being escorted out of the room, he hurled insults at the jury which convicted him. DeWayne Lee Harris is currently serving his sentence at the Clallam Bay Corrections Center.

The tribe has been divided into two subtribes, Aillutticina, with five Neotropical genera, and Sitticina, with five genera from Eurasia and the Americas. One genus is unplaced within the tribe. The taxonomy of the tribe has been subject to considerable uncertainty. It was clarified in 2020. Description The group is now primarily defined by molecular phylogenetic analysis. However, members can be distinguished from other salticids by the fourth leg being much longer than the third and by the absence of the retromarginal cheliceral tooth. Taxonomy The group was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1901, under the name \\"Sitticeae\\". It was treated as the subfamily Sitticinae by various authors before being reduced to the tribe Sitticini by Wayne Maddison in 2015. The taxonomy of the tribe has been subject to considerable uncertainty; generic boundaries were changed repeatedly between 2017 and 2020. For example, Attulus floricola was known as Sitticus floricola until moved to Sittiflor floricola in 2017, to Calositticus floricola in 2018, back to Sitticus floricola in 2019, and then to Attulus floricola in 2020. Most sitticines were placed in Sitticus until 2017, when Jerzy Pr√≥szy≈Ñski split the genus into seven: Attulus, Sitticus and five new genera Sittiab, Sittiflor, Sittilong, Sittipub and Sittisax. This division was not based on a phylogenetic analysis but was intended to be \\"pragmatic\\". A molecular phylogenetic analysis in 2020 restored most sitticine species to a single genus, Attulus (the name which has priority over Sitticus), circumscribed to include Sitticus, Sittiflor, Sittilong and Sittipub. (Pr√≥szy≈Ñski's Sittisax was retained, but his Sittiab was synonymized with Attinella.) , the World Spider Catalog recognized 58 species in Attulus, as opposed to 15 in Jollas, one of the next largest genera in the tribe. Phylogeny In 2020, Maddison and co-workers divided the tribe Sitticini into two subtribes, Aillutticina and Sitticina, each with five genera, and published a cladogram showing the relationship among the genera in Sitticina: Subtribes and genera Genera included in the tribe Sitticini by Maddison and co-workers in 2020 were: *Subtribe Aillutticina **Aillutticus Galiano, 1987 **Amatorculus Ruiz & Brescovit, 2005 **Capeta Ruiz & Brescovit, 2005 **Gavarilla Ruiz & Brescovit, 2006 **Nosferattus Ruiz & Brescovit, 2005 *Subtribe Sitticina **Attinella Banks, 1905 **Attulus Simon, 1889 **Jollas Simon, 1901 **Sittisax Pr√≥szy≈Ñski, 2017 **Tomis F.O. P-Cambridge, 1901 *incertae sedis **Semiopyla Simon, 1901 Distribution The five genera placed in the subtribe Aillutticina are found in the Neotropics and the Caribbean. The five genera placed in the subtribe Sitticina are native to Eurasia and the rest of the Americas. The unplaced genus Semiopyla is found from Mexico to Argentina and Paraguay. It is believed that the tribe originated in the Neotropics, and diverged rapidly more recently in Eurasia, with dispersal back into the Americas.
