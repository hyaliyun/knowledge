Opened in 1989, it is operated by the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. Most of the prisoners‚Äî1,300 of the 1,500 or so as of June 2016‚Äîare awaiting trial. In May 2013, Orleans Parish Prison ranked as one of the ten worst prisons in the United States, based on reporting in Mother Jones magazine.  Abandonment during Hurricane Katrina  On August 29, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina‚Äìan extremely destructive and deadly category 5 hurricane‚Äìstruck the Gulf Coast, the staff of Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office abandoned the jail leaving roughly 650 prisoners in their cells with no access to food, water, or ventilation for days. Deputies returned to the Orleans Parish Prison days later and began evacuating inmates to surrounding areas which included the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, the I-10 overpass, and the Broad Street overpass. In over 400 testimonials conducted by the American Civil Liberties Union, prisoners described their experiences during the abandonment which included exposure to floodwater and other elements, hunger, beatings by jail staff and other inmates, and other racially charged abuse by jail staff. While there is no official death count for prisoners that were left behind, 517 prisoners were later registered as \\"unaccounted for\\" by Humans Rights Watch. Refurbishment The Federal Emergency Management Agency dedicated $223 million to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office for restoration of its facilities following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Sheriff's Office has outlined three phases of construction that would utilize these funds. =Phase I= The Phase I facility is a three-story, building consisting of a kitchen and warehouse. =Phase II= Opened in 2015, Phase II contains 1,438 beds and cost $145 million to construct. =Phase III= The Sheriff‚Äôs office plans to build an additional 750-bed facility. The Orleans Parish Prison Reform Coalition opposes the plan, calling on Mayor Mitch Landrieu's office to \\"oppose any options involving the expansion of the jail,\\" and instead support \\"retrofitting of the current jail to better care for incarcerated special populations.\\" Inmate deaths since Katrina Between April 2006 and April 2014, The Times-Picayune reports 44 inmate deaths, including seven \\"uncounted\\" deaths, referring to inmates released shortly before their deaths. Since the report, there have been five additional fatalities, bringing the total to 49 since April 2006.

He was a great-grandson of Abraham-Leib Monsohn, one of the founders of the Ashkenazi Old Yishuv of Jerusalem in the early nineteenth century, and a son of Abraham-Leib Monsohn II, a founder of the A.L. Monsohn Lithography in Jerusalem. After marrying, Monsohn lived with his family in the Batei Broide section of Nachlaot, Jerusalem, which provided housing for rabbis and their families. In 1924 Monsohn immigrated to the United States with a group of rabbis from Eretz Israel, settling in Brooklyn, New York, where he served as rabbi of Congregation Ezrath Israel on Gates Avenue, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section, until his death in 1953. His book, Mi-Peninei Ha- Rambam: Bi‚Äôur ‚Äòal ha-Torah, a compendium of Maimonides‚Äô commentaries on the Pentateuch, arranged by the compiler in order of the Torah chapters, first appeared in Brooklyn c.1925 and was reprinted there several times in the early 1930s. In 2006 it was re-released by Mossad Harav Kook of Jerusalem, which also published an English translation, Pearls of the Rambam (tr. Avraham Berkovits) c. 2008. Some of the early editions included a Yiddish introduction to the life of Maimonides. Expanded description Monsohn‚Äôs intellectual prowess became apparent at an early age: at 16 he received rabbinical ordination (semikhah) from Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the first Ashkenazic chief rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine; diverging from his usual practice, Rabbi Kook gave Monsohn an approbation to be published in his Mi-Peninei Ha- Rambam. To earn a living, for a while Monsohn worked at the lithographic press established in Jerusalem by his father and uncle. But he objected to the press's printing of a calendar for one of the Jerusalem churches and he quit the press. After establishing himself as a rabbi in Brooklyn, New York, Monsohn brought his wife, Zipporah Yehudit (Chipe, n√©e Silberman, a descendant of Yitschak Shatz/Schwartz and Baruch-Mordechai Schwartz, who immigrated to Jerusalem from Nesvizh in the early 19th century) and their Jerusalem-born children, Eshke (Esther Schwartz, wife of Max Schwartz), Shmuel (Samuel Stanford Manson), Shimon (Simon Manson), and Chaya Masha Gitl (Marsha Bunis, wife of Jacob Bunis) to Brooklyn; their daughter Raytse (Rose Aronson, wife of Matthew Aronson) was born there. In Brooklyn, Monsohn eked out a living, devoting most of his time to work on his Mi-Penine Ha-Rambam, which he printed himself, using the skills acquired at his father‚Äôs press. In all editions of his book Monsohn noted that he was born in Jerusalem.

Schippers, who also plays one of the lead characters, Jacques Plafond. It ran on VPRO television for six episodes in 1981 before being canceled, and then returned for another six episodes. Content The show's plot was intentionally unclear, though one plot line involved the head of a \\"school with the bible\\", Rein Schaambergen, whose marriage is threatened when he meets singer Ingrid Gortebroek in the bar \\"The Old Dick\\" and decides to produce a record for her. De lachende scheerkwast turned out to be a play written by writer Jacques Plafond (played by Schippers), and the show itself was a chaotic affair (\\"anarchist...always derailing\\") with more emphasis on absurdist, comical scenes and linguistic jokery than on story development. It was a prequel of sorts to Schippers' later radio show Ronflonflon (1984-1991) and his television shows Opzoek naar Yolanda (1984), Plafond over de vloer (1986), and We zijn weer thuis (1989-1994).

The Dutch village Olst, for instance, named one of its parks for the show's Willy Dobbeplantsoen; Willy Dobbe, a Dutch TV announcer for the TROS broadcaster, stood for the petty bourgeois mentality the show made fun of. Dobbe herself was the guest of honor at the park's ten-year anniversary, which was attended by Schippers alumni such as Dolf Brouwers (Sjef van Oekel), Clous van Mechelen (Jan Vos), and Rob van Houten (Boy Bensdorp). At the occasion, Olst's mayor, Tom Strien, indicated how controversial the show was since he was forbidden by his parents to watch it.

Johnson (January 10, 1875 - 1963) was a Norwegian-born, American boat builder, early aviator, and inventor in White Bear Lake, Minnesota.  Early life and boat building  Johnson was born in Oslo, Norway. His mother died when he was seven years old and his father sent him to live with relatives for his room and board. At age fifteen he worked on a coastal steamer that delivered supplies to coastal villages. In 1893, he emigrated to America, traveling to White Bear Lake, Minnesota where he lived and worked for a fellow Norwegian, Gus Amundson. In 1896, he started his own boat building business, Johnson Boat Works, building boats for members of the White Bear Yacht Club. In those days, White Bear Lake was a resort town with hotels, parks, steamboats and boat rentals. Twenty-five trains a day came here from St. Paul bringing visitors to enjoy the lake. John's first major success was the Minnezitka a 38 ft. scow design sailboat that won the championship on the lake in 1900. LOC 99-76392 This boat was said to be beginning of the speedy scow design that skimmed over the water. A model of this boat was later displayed at the Smithsonian Museum. The Johnson Boat Works became well known nationally as well as in Canada and foreign countries. The 38 ft. scow design became the class A-boat. Later racing classes included the 32 ft. B-boat, the 28 ft. E-boat, the 20 ft. C-boat and others.  Aviation  In addition to designing and building sailboats, Johnson was also an inventor. He was the first aviator in Minnesota to achieve a take off from a level surface in a powered airplane. He built his airplane in his back yard and flew it from the frozen lake. From the St. Paul Dispatch January 26, 2010: \\"WHITE BEAR MAN FLIES OVER LAKE. Inventor, Johnson, soars about 200 feet, then engine misses fire, and he falls.\\" The crash landing destroyed the fragile aircraft. Johnson built a second airplane, but did not have the funds to buy a suitable engine. His wife told him that flying airplanes was too dangerous, ending his attempts.  Snowplow invention  In the 1920s, local road crews were unable to clear the roads of snow during winters with heavy snowfalls. Car owners put their vehicles away and used horse drawn sleighs for travel or used the train to get into the city. Johnson designed and built a rotary snowplow in the winter of 1921. He asked a lawyer, who lived on the lake, to get a patent.United States Patent Office \\"J. O. Johnson Snowplow Patent 1,524,518\\" filed Aug. 23, 1923, issued Jan. 27, 1925 Johnson paid for the patent work by building the lawyer a large iceboat. This snowplow was very successful, and some Minneapolis businessmen bought the patent and built the Snow King plows. With the money from the sale of the snowplow business, Johnson was able to enlarge and modernize his boat works business.  Death  Johnson died in 1963. He had earlier given over the business to his three sons, Milton, Iver and Walter. The Johnson Boat Works continued until it was sold in 1998 after 102 years of business.

History  Initially named Sri Veeresalingam library, since it was backed by the nationalist Kandukuri Veeresalingam Pantulu, it was housed in Nalam Choultry in Innispeta with a very small collection. Around the same time Addanki Satyanarayana established the Vasuraya Library. Andhra Desa Grandhalaya Sangham secretary Pathuri Nageswara Rao suggested merger of the two libraries to get regional status. Following the advice of the elite in the city, the two libraries were merged and named as Gowthami Grandhalayam and registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1920. Vavilala Gopala Krishnaiah and AB Nageswara Rao were successful in getting regional status to the library. In 1979, the government took over the library. With the increase in collections the library moved to the Town Hall in Rajahmundry. The library enjoyed the patronage of persons like Kanchumarti Seetaramachandra Rao, the Raja of Jaipur Sri Raja Vikrama Deva Varma (1869‚Äì1951), Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham, Bhamidipati Kameswara Rao, Kasinathuni Nageswara Rao, Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy and Pathuri Nagabhushanam. It had the reputation of quenching the literary thirst of people from foreign origin as well.  Efforts  Later land was bought at Lakshmivarapupeta and a rich landlord Kanchumarti Seetaramachandra Rao constructed a building in memory of his daughter Babayamma (one of the first women to complete matriculation in Rajahmundry) who died young. The Babayamma Hall, served as the library building until the 1970s and still exists, behind the new building. Kanchumarti Babayamma is the first women Municipal Councillor of Rajahmundry.

Van Mechelen scored a minor hit in 1969 with his band The Butlers, and became widely known through the radio and television shows written and directed by Wim T. Schippers (he is referred to as his \\"house composer\\"), in which he played the character Jan Vos and wrote songs for the various characters (including Barend Servet and Sjef van Oekel). Biography Van Mechelen has been playing jazz since the 1950s; Hans Dulfer played in his band. He collaborated with a number of writers and artists associated with the Amsterdam daily newspaper Het Parool in the cabaret show De Inktvis, including Annie M. G. Schmidt. He had considerable success writing music for commercials, notably for the Grolsch Brewery (the \\"jazzy music\\" for the \\"Vakmanschap is Meesterschap\\" commercials), for Nationale Nederlanden, and for chicken. He wrote for film (with Theo van Gogh), and recorded with Tol Hansse, for whom he wrote the music for his greatest hit, \\"Big City\\" (earlier, Hansse and van Mechelen were members of a rock band, The Sharks). With his band, Het Nieuwe Trio, he plays 1950s/1960s style music. With Schippers (Ernie) and Paul Haenen (Bert) he recorded music for a number of Bert and Ernie albums, and for Haenen's character Margreet Dolman.

More than 60,000 homes were destroyed and 840,000 people evacuated from Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces due to flooding which happened at the same time as flooding in China's southern Guangdong province.\\"More Than 200 Dead or Missing in China Floods\\", ABC News, August 20, 2013\\"China floods death toll passes 150\\", Inquirer.net, August 19, 2013 Floods and damage Khabarovsk-Komsomolsk Highway, September 1 From the end of July to mid-August 2013, unusually heavy rainfall occurred near the Amur River, which marks the dividing line between China and Russia. Starting on August 10, 2013, areas of northeastern China began to experience flooding. From August 15 to 17, heavy rainfall worsened the problem, causing the worst flooding in the region in more than a decade. Nankouqian Township, one of the hardest-hit areas, saw of rain, half the average annual total, on August 16 alone. By August 18, water levels at 61 reservoirs surpassed the \\"danger\\" level. Fushun city in the Liaoning province was especially hard hit as rainstorms caused several rivers in the city to overflow. Across the border in eastern Russia, heavy flooding was also reported, with Amur Oblast, Jewish Autonomous Oblast and Khabarovsk Krai the hardest hit. More than 140 towns were affected by what Russia authorities described as the worst flooding in 120 years. The Amur River reached a record , surpassing the previous record set in 1984, and was still rising as of August 19, threatening to flood the major city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur. In China, more than 60,000 homes were destroyed and numerous roads were blocked or damaged. More than 787,000 hectares of farm land were ruined in the region which depends heavily on farming. Power and communications lines were downed in several townships. Total damaged was estimated at 16.14 billion yuan (approx. US$2.6 billion/‚Ç¨1.94 billion). In Russia, 3.2 billion rubles (approx. US$97 million/‚Ç¨73 million) was allocated for relief efforts. Casualties China's Liaoning province was the hardest hit with 54 reported deaths and 97 people missing as of August 19, 2013. In Jilin province, 16 deaths were reported. Heilongjiang province experienced 11 deaths. Across the region 360,000 people were displaced and 3.74 million affected in some way. No casualties were reported in Russia, but 20,000 people were evacuated. Two captive brown bears were rescued via helicopter. Unrelated flooding resulting from Typhoon Utor in south China occurred simultaneously, causing the death tolls from the two floods to be combined in official reports. Typhoon Utor floods killed at least 33 people. Relief efforts and aftermath In Russia, more than 30,000 volunteers helped distribute 53 tons of food and supplies to flood victims. Officials are considering delaying the mayoral elections in Amur which are scheduled for September 8. A decision on the elections will be made August 27. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping called for \\"all-out efforts\\" as relief work got underway. More than 120,000 people, including 10,000 soldiers, helped with relief and rescue efforts.

Previously, as an RBI deputy governor, he looked after monetary policy, economic policy research, statistics and information management, deposit insurance, communication and Right to Information. Appointed by the NDA government, Patel succeeded Raghuram Rajan as RBI governor on 4 September 2016. He resigned from his post on 10 December 2018, being the first RBI governor to state personal reasons as a driving factor for resigning. He is the fifth RBI governor to have resigned from his post before his term ended in September 2019, and had the shortest tenure since 1992. Early life and education Urjit Patel was born in Nairobi on 28 October 1963 to Manjula and Ravindra Patel. His grandfather had migrated from Mahudha village in Kheda district, Gujarat to Kenya in the 20th century. His parents run Raxo Products Ltd, a chemical factory in Nairobi. He studied at the Gujarati community run Visa Oswal Primary School and later at Jamhuri High School in Nairobi. He studied at London School of Economics and was awarded Bachelor of Science degree in economics from University of London. He later earned a Master of Philosophy degree in economics from Linacre College, Oxford in 1986. He later earned a doctorate in economics from Yale University in 1990. He was at IMF India Desk during the 1991‚Äì94 transition period. Professional career After obtaining his Ph.D., Patel joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1990, where he worked on the US, India, Bahamas and Myanmar desks till 1995. Thereafter he went on deputation from the IMF to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), where he played an advisory role in the development of the debt market, banking sector reforms, pension fund reforms, and targeting of real exchange rate. After the two-year deputation with RBI, Patel became a Consultant to the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, holding the position from 1998 to 2001. He also served on the board of the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation in 2006-07. Between 2000 and 2004, Patel worked with several High-Level Committees at both Central and State Government levels: * Competition Commission of India * Task Force on Direct Taxes * Prime Minister's Task Force on Infrastructure * Group of Ministers on Telecom Matters * Advisory Committee on Research Projects and Market Studies * Committee on Civil Aviation Reforms * Expert Group on State Electricity Boards * High-Level Expert Group on Civil and Defence Services Pension System Prior to his appointment as the Deputy Governor at RBI in 2013, Patel was an advisor (Energy and Infrastructure) with the Boston Consulting Group, and he has also worked with Reliance Industries in the past. On 11 January 2013, Patel was appointed as Deputy Governor of RBI for a period of three years.

Controversies Although Patel cited personal reasons for resigning from RBI, experts have opined that he was forced to exit because of serious differences with the Government of India. The latter wanted more money from RBI to fund its fiscal deficit, which Patel did not agree to, citing requirement for long term financial stability. In August 2019 Nitin Gadkari fueled the controversy when he stated that he had advised the Union Finance Minister to \\"throw out\\" the RBI Governor because the latter was inflexible and adamant.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kendal, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. Along with St George's Church and the Church of Holy Trinity and St George it is one of three churches in the town designed by local architect George Webster. History Building of the church started in 1835, and it was consecrated on 5 July 1837. It was designed by the local architect George Webster. The church has subsequently altered, and additions have been made; in particular the interior has been extensively remodelled. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in stone with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave without aisles and a short chancel, an octagonal north vestry, and an embraced west tower. The tower is in four stages. In the bottom stage are triple lancet windows flanked by single lancets; there are three stepped lancets in the second stage; a clock (moved from the town hall) in the third stage; and paired lancet bell openings in the top stage. Surmounting the tower is a castellated parapet with corner pinnacles. Along the sides of the church are paired lancets, separated by stepped buttresses. At the east end are three stepped lancets. The church is entered from the north side, through a concrete parish centre that was added in 1980. =Interior= The interior of the church has been much altered. The nave is fully carpeted, and has been opened up into the parish centre on the north side. There is a gallery, but the original galleries have been removed along with the tie-beams and king posts of the roof. Fittings The pulpit of 1882 has been reduced, and the reredos has been removed. In the east window is near-abstract stained glass made by Shrigley and Hunt. There appear to have been two 19th century pipe organs in the building which were removed before 1900. There is a reference to the church wanting to dispose of an organ in the 1860s because it was too loud. An organ was built in about 1881 by Thomas Wilkinson of Kendal, and was moved to Hightown Methodist Church, Luton, in 1898. This was replaced by a three-manual organ made by Harrison and Harrison, which was enlarged by the same company in 1909. Appraisal The church was designated as a Grade II listed building on 30 January 1985. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing, and is granted to buildings that are \\"nationally important and of special interest\\".

The phrase retrometabolic drug design was coined by Nicholas Bodor. The method is analogous to retrosynthetic analysis where the synthesis of a target molecule is planned backwards. In retrometabolic drug design, metabolic reaction information of drugs is used to design parent drugs whose metabolism and distribution can be controlled to target and eliminate the drug to increase efficacy and minimize undesirable side effects. The new drugs thus designed achieve selective organ and/or therapeutic site drug targeting and produce safe therapeutic agents and safe environmental chemicals. These approaches represent systematic methodologies that thoroughly integrate structure-activity (SAR) and structure-metabolism (SMR) relationships and are aimed at designing safe, locally active compounds with improved therapeutic index (ratio of benefit vs. side effect). Retrometabolic drug design loop that includes chemical delivery systems (CDS) design and soft drug (SD) design. Possible metabolic pathways for drugs (D) in general are indicated within the dashed box.  Classification  The concept of retrometabolic drug design encompasses two distinct approaches. One approach is the design of soft drugs (SDs), new, active therapeutic agents, often isosteric or isolelectronic analogs of a lead compound, with a chemical structure specifically designed to allow predictable metabolism into inactive metabolites after exerting their desired therapeutic effect(s). The other approach is the design of chemical delivery systems (CDSs). CDSs are biologically inert molecules intended to enhance drug delivery to a particular organ or site and requiring several conversion steps before releasing the active drug. Although both retrometabolic design approaches involve chemical modifications of the molecular structure and both require enzymatic reactions to fulfill drug targeting, the principles of SD and CDS design are distinctly different. While CDSs are inactive as administered and sequential enzymatic reactions provide the differential distribution and ultimately release the active drug, SDs are active as administered and are designed to be easily metabolized into inactive species. Assuming an ideal situation, with a CDS the drug is present at the site and nowhere else in the body because enzymatic processes destroy the drug at those sites. Whereas, CDSs are designed to achieve drug targeting at a selected organ or site, SDs are designed to afford a differential distribution that can be regarded as reverse targeting. = Soft drugs = Since its introduction by Nicholas Bodor in the late 1970s, the soft drug concept generated considerable research both in academic and in industrial settings. Bodor defined soft drugs as biologically active, therapeutically useful chemical compounds characterized by a predictable and controllable in vivo metabolism to non- toxic moieties after they achieve their therapeutic role. There are several rationally designed soft drugs that have either already reached the market, such as * esmolol (Breviblock) * landiolol (Onoact) * remifentanil (Ultiva) * loteprednol etabonate (Lotemax, Alrex, Zylet) * clevidipine (Cleviprex) or are in late-stage development (remimazolam, budiodarone, celivarone, AZD3043, tecafarin). There are also compounds that can be considered as soft chemicals (e.g., malathion) or soft drugs (e.g., articaine, methylphenidate) even though they were not developed as such. = Chemical delivery systems = Since their introduction in the early 1980s, CDSs have also generated considerable research work, especially for brain and eye targeting of various therapeutic agents, including those that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier or the blood-retinal barrier on their own. Within this approach, three major general CDS classes have been identified: :* Enzymatic physicochemical-based (e.g., brain-targeting) CDSs: exploit site-specific traffic properties by sequential metabolic conversions that result in considerably altered properties :* Site- specific enzyme-activated (e.g., eye-targeting) CDSs: exploit specific enzymes found primarily, exclusively, or at higher activity at the site of action :* Receptor-based transient anchor-type (e.g., lung-targeting) CDSs: provide enhanced selectivity and activity through transient, reversible binding at the receptor This concept has been extended to many drugs and peptides, its importance illustrated by the fact that its first applications and uses were published in Science in 1975, 1981 and 1983. Its extension to the targeted brain-delivery of neuropeptides was included by the Harvard Health Letter as one of the top 10 medical advances of 1992. Several compounds have reached advanced clinical development phase, such as :* E2-CDS (Estredox) for the brain-targeted delivery of estradiol and :* betaxoxime for the eye-targeted delivery of betaxolol In the first example above, brain-targeted CDSs employ a sequential metabolic conversion of a redox-based targetor moiety, which is closely related to the ubiquitous NAD(P)H ‚áå NAD(P)+ coenzyme system, to exploit the unique properties of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). After enzymatic oxidation of the NADH type drug conjugate to its corresponding NAD+\\\\- drug, the still inactive precursor, \\"locks-in\\" behind the BBB to provide targeted and sustained CNS-delivery of the compound of interest. The second example involves eye-specific delivery of betaxoxime, the oxime derivative of betaxolol. The administered, inactive Œ≤-amino-ketoxime is converted to the corresponding ketone via oxime hydrolase, an enzyme recently identified with preferential activity in the eye, and then stereospecifically reduced to its alcohol form. IOP-lowering activity is demonstrated without producing the active Œ≤-blockers systemically, making them void of any cardiovascular activity, a major drawback of classical antiglaucoma agents. Because of the advantages provided by this unique eye-targeting profile, oxime-based eye-targeting CDSs could replace the Œ≤-blockers currently used for ophthalmic applications.  History and significance  These retrometabolic design strategies were introduced by Nicholas Bodor, one of the first and most prominent advocates for the early integration of metabolism, pharmacokinetic and general physicochemical considerations in the drug design process. These drug design concepts recognize the importance of design-controlled metabolism and directly focus not on the increase of activity alone but on the increase of the activity/toxicity ratio (therapeutic index) in order to deliver the maximum benefit while also reducing or eliminating unwanted side effects. The importance of this field is reviewed in a book dedicated to the subject (Bodor, N.; Buchwald, P.; Retrometabolic Drug Design and Targeting, 1st ed., Wiley & Sons, 2012), as well as by a full chapter of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Design, 7th ed. (2010) with close to 150 chemical structures and more than 450 references. At the time of its introduction, the idea of designed-in metabolism represented a significant novelty and was against mainstream thinking then in place that instead focused on minimizing or entirely eliminating drug metabolism. Bodor's work on these design concepts developed during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and came to prominence during the mid-1990s. Loteprednol etabonate, a soft corticosteroid designed and patented by Bodor received final Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1998 as the active ingredient of two ophthalmic preparations (Lotemax and Alrex), currently the only corticosteroid approved by the FDA for use in all inflammatory and allergy-related ophthalmic disorders. Its safety for long- term use further supports the soft drug concept, and in 2004, loteprednol etabonate was also approved as part of a combination product (Zylet). A second generation of soft corticosteroids such as etiprednol dicloacetate is in development for a full spectrum of other possible applications such as nasal spray for rhinitis or inhalation products for asthma. The soft drug concept ignited research work in both academic (e.g., Aston University, G√∂teborg University, Okayama University, Uppsala University, University of Iceland, University of Florida, Universit√© Louis Pasteur, Yale University) and industrial (e.g., AstraZeneca, DuPont, GlaxoSmithKline, IVAX, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Nippon Organon, Novartis, ONO Pharmaceutical, Schering AG) settings. Besides corticosteroids, various other therapeutic areas have been pursued such as soft beta-blockers, soft opioid analgetics, soft estrogens, soft beta-agonists, soft anticholinergics, soft antimicrobials, soft antiarrhythmic agents, soft angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, soft dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors, soft cancineurin inhibitors (soft immunosuppressants), soft matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, soft cytokine inhibitors, soft cannabinoids, soft Ca2+ channel blockers (see for a recent review). Following the introduction of the CDS concepts, work along those lines started in numerous pharmaceutical centers around the world, and brain-targeting CDSs were explored for many therapeutic agents such as steroids (testosterone, progestins, estradiol, dexamethasone), anti-infective agents (penicillins, sulfonamides), antivirals (acyclovir, trifluorothymidine, ribavirin), antiretrovirals (AZT, ganciclovir), anticancer agents (Lomustine, chlorambucil), neurotransmitters (dopamine, GABA), nerve growth factor (NGF) inducers, anticonvulsants (Phenytoin, valproate, stiripentol), Ca2+ antagonists (felodipine), MAO inhibitors, NSAIDs and neuropeptides (tryptophan, Leu-enkephalin analogs, TRH analogs, kyotorphin analogs). A number of new chemical entities (NCE) were developed based on these principles, such as E2-CDS (Estredox or betaxoxime are in advanced clinical development phases. A review of ongoing research using the general retrometabolic design approaches is conducted biennially at the Retrometabolism Based Drug Design and Targeting Conference, an international series of symposia developed and organized by Nicholas Bodor.

After studying philosophy and history in Berlin (1887 - 1890), he worked as an art and theatre critic for the Berliner Tageblatt newspaper and from 1891 he was active as a writer in Berlin. In his novel Hann Kl√ºth, der Philosoph (1905) and in his collection of novellas Die Leute von Moorluke (1910), set in Greifswald and surrounds, he portrayed lively and life-affirming north German characters. He wrote many dramas, but they are no longer performed. Engel was the President of the Imperial Union of German Literatur (Reichsverbandes des deutschen Schrifttums). This organisation provided social security for independent authors. He acquired recognition and awards of merit for this. During the National Socialist period, his work was considered undesirable as Engel was non-Aryan by the state's definition. The commemorative plaque was removed from the house in Greifswald where he was born, his gravestone in Elisenhain (a forest in Greifswald) was knocked over.

The film had its premiere at the Horrorthon Film Festival at the Irish Film Institute on 25 October 2015 and was released in cinemas in Ireland on 13 November 2015. It is the feature film debut of director Gerard Lough. Although often described as an anthology film, it actually belongs to the sub genre of film known as Hyperlink due to its interwoven story lines. Premise A pair of professional but badly mismatched criminals break into a vacant house to carry out an insurance scam. Awkwardly thrown together with an hour to kill, they reluctantly start telling each other tall tales. One concerns two friends who discover a mysterious device that may be of alien origin. The other is about an ambitious business woman who provides a dating agency for wealthy fetishists. She attempts to escape this shady line of work by taking on a new client whose habits may be of the vampiric variety. As the night progresses the line between fiction and reality starts to blur and the hidden agendas of both thieves become apparent. Production =Development= After finishing his promotional duties on the Sci-Fi short film Ninety Seconds, Lough decided it was now the right time to make his feature film debut. He was inspired by the \\"Horror / Sci-Fi anthology films of the '80s such as Creepshow, The Twilight Zone and Cat's Eye but with the goal of having each story blend together to make one big story and then bring it stylistically up to date for a modern audience.\\" The screenplay went through close to a dozen drafts and the original idea of four interconnecting stories was eventually changed to three. Many of the same cast and crew he previously worked with on his short films returned for this film. Other influences included the New Wave music scene of the early 80's and France's 'Cinema du Look' movement. =Production= Principal photography began in Co Donegal, Ireland on 1 August 2013 with a series of demanding night shoots. Because the film is divided up into three different stories, the unusual production had to be treated as three different films as each tale had a completely different cast, look, locations, etc., which necessitated a prep / shoot / post process that would repeat itself with each tale and take shooting well into 2014. The film started shooting on Canon HD cameras which Lough had worked with before on his short film Ninety Seconds and had found to be very sensitive to low light conditions and night shoots. The shoot took in many visually striking locations as diverse as Fanad Lighthouse, Barnesmore Gap and Grianan of Aileach but constantly ran into bad weather. As Lough joked in an interview, \\"All the rain in the movie is not me paying homage to Blade Runner ‚Äì it's the real thing\\". The shoot moved to Dublin for two days to use locations such as The Marker Hotel. Principal photography ended on 23 August 2014. =Post Production= Over a six-month period, composer Cian Furlong created over an hour's worth of densely layered, completely electronic music. His score was made entirely on Mulab while also using orchestral samples such as brass and strings. The score included a new electronic version of The Flower Duet from the opera Lakme. Its inclusion was intended by Lough as a homage to director Tony Scott who used the same music in his feature debut The Hunger, a film that influenced Night People. Musically the rest of the film included seven different synthesizer tracks from various up and coming bands and artists such as Electro Kill Machine (who contributed two songs). All of the film's visual effects were produced solely by Paul Barrett. The film received a '16' certificate from the Irish Film Censor Office for \\"Strong scenes of gory violence/torture\\" and \\"Strong sex references\\". Marketing Director Gerard Lough at a screening for his film 'Night People'The first of four teaser posters appeared on the Irish film website Scannain on 18 August 2014. A second poster made its debut on The Movie Bit on 28 August. The third teaser poster appeared on British film website Horror Cult Films soon after. The final teaser poster was released in May 2015. The teaser trailer was released on 1 September 2014 and focused on a group of men uncovering a mysterious item buried in the grounds of Grianan of Aileach. It also introduced all the main characters and an explanation of the term \\"Night People\\" as depicted in the fictional world of the film. A slightly longer version of the teaser was screened at Dublin's Horrorthon Film Festival a month later. On 9 February 2015 a music video for a single also called Night People by Voynich was released. It featured six of the cast members, was directed by Lough and was shot on location in Dublin and Donegal. The song was an E.D.M. track that sampled dialogue from the film. Unable to come up with a strong ad line for the final poster, the film-makers ran a competition open to the public where the winning suggestion would be used. The final poster was released on 17 September 2015. The trailer made its debut on Daily Dead on 26 August 2015. Connection to Ninety Seconds Two characters from Lough's 2012 short film Ninety Seconds appear in the film. Mark, a cynical surveillance expert played by Andrew Norry and The Administrator, an office manager bully played by Geraldine Foy. Apart from some of the same locations being used again (Dublin's Convention Centre, Donegal's Letterkenny Cathedral) the short shares no other similarities with Night People. Music The film's mainly synthesizer score was composed by Cian Furlong and was released on 15 November 2015. In addition to this the following tracks appear in the film. # \\"Warped\\" by Electro Kill Machine # \\"Skyline\\" by 1977 # \\"Electric Blue\\" by Electro Kill Machine # \\"Moonlight\\" by Labstrakt # \\"Calling Me\\" by Voice Controller Kristi # \\"Talaimon\\" by Ciaran McCann # \\"The Key\\" (Lasso d'Amore Remix) by Riot Tapes # \\"The Flower Duet\\" by Leo Delibes (performed by Cian Furlong) # \\"Night People\\" by Voynich Lough would go on to direct music videos for Night People and Warped. Release and reception The film went on limited cinema release in Ireland on 13 November 2015. David Prendeville in his review for Film Ireland hailed the film as one that \\"neither looks nor sounds like any other Irish film\\" and added that \\"This ambitious film is full of distinctive flavor\\" while singling out Michael Parle as the \\"real star of the show\\". As did Dan Woolstencroft in his review for Nerdly who thought \\"he has great charisma. It‚Äôs a bit of shame he isn‚Äôt given more to do...\\" and concluded \\"Clearly made on a low budget, that doesn‚Äôt dampen the enthusiasm and vision that Lough has pumped into the film.\\" Andrew Thompson from Legless Corpse praised the film as one that \\"feels personal, intimate, and coldly spooky\\" and singled out Claire Blennerhassett's performance as a stand out as a \\"frustrated character, captured by her lifestyle yet so desperate to leave it that she would sell her soul.\\" Tom Little of Mr Rumsey's Film Related Musings had mixed feelings, writing \\"Beautiful, haunting imagery and a few interesting ideas don‚Äôt quite coalesce to form a compelling whole in Night People.\\" However, he concluded that \\"there‚Äôs no denying this is a film of ideas.\\" Ed Fortune's review in Starburst Magazine also praised Blennerhassett's \\"great performance\\" and described the film as a \\"good indie horror anthology\\". Matt Boiselle predicted in his review for Dread Central that \\"this vehicle should only drive him (Lough) further into bigger and more memorable projects in the future...\\" and described the film as a \\"creative little anthology piece that manages to entertain as well as provide some genuine thrills from the performances within.\\" Elliot Maguire's review in UK Horror Scene rated the film as \\"an ambitious, stylishly made little neon-lit horror, full of imagination and twists on conventions.\\" Home media The film was released on VOD on 9 May 2016.http://filmireland.net/2016/12/12/night-people-available-on-amazon-prime/ See also * Hyperlink cinema * List of Irish films References External links * * Category:2015 films Category:Irish films Category:Irish horror films Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland Category:Hyperlink films ","title":"Night People (2015 film)"},{"id":"40288092","text":"Anzar (, also Romanized as AnzÃÑar and Anzer) is a village in Chavarzaq Rural District, Chavarzaq District, Tarom County, Zanjan Province, Iran.

A fairly normal mapping can easily address up to 95 Megabit of ROM data (63 Megabits at FastROM speed) with 8 Megabits of battery-backed RAM. However, most available memory access controllers only support mappings of up to 32 Megabits. The largest games released (Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean) contain 48 Megabits of ROM data, while the smallest games contain 2 Megabits. Cartridges may also contain battery-backed SRAM to save the game state, extra working RAM, custom coprocessors, or any other hardware that will not exceed the maximum current rating of the console. Enhancement chips As part of the overall plan for the Super NES, rather than include an expensive CPU that would still become obsolete in a few years, the hardware designers made it easy to interface special coprocessor chips to the console (just like the MMC chips used for most NES games). This is most often characterized by 16 additional pins on the cartridge card edge. The Super FX is a RISC CPU designed to perform functions that the main CPU could not feasibly do. The chip was primarily used to create 3D game worlds made with polygons, texture mapping and light source shading. The chip could also be used to enhance 2D games with effects such as sprite scaling and rotation.(2007-05-01) Snes9x readme.txt v1.51. Snes9x. Snes9x. Retrieved on July 3, 2007. The Nintendo fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP) chip allows for fast vector-based calculations, bitmap conversions, both 2D and 3D coordinate transformations, and other functions. Refer to the command summaries for all four DSP versions. Four revisions of the chip exist, each physically identical but with different microcode. The DSP-1 version, including the later 1A and 1B bug fix revisions, is most popular; the DSP-2, DSP-3, and DSP-4 are in only one game each. Similar to the 5A22 CPU in the console, the SA-1 chip contains a 65c816 processor core clocked at 10 MHz, a memory mapper, DMA, decompression and bitplane conversion circuitry, several programmable timers, and CIC region lockout functionality. In Japan, games could be downloaded for a fee from Nintendo Power kiosks onto special cartridges containing flash memory and a MegaChips MX15001TFC chip. The chip managed communication with the kiosks to download ROM images, and provided an initial menu to select which of the downloaded games would be played. Some games were available both in cartridge and download form, while others were download only. The service was discontinued on February 8, 2007. Many cartridges contain other enhancement chips, most of which were created for use by a single company in a few games; the only limitations are the speed of the Super NES itself to transfer data from the chip and the current limit of the console. Design change For the region of United States and Canada, the cartridge locking mechanism of the game console is only present in earlier versions of the system. After the locking mechanism was removed, USA/Canada cartridges were redesigned to defeat the locking mechanisms in older consoles. Cartridges with the newer design started appearing in 1993. Depending on the date of production, some games are available with both cartridge styles. Super Mario All-Stars and most later USA/Canada releases were only made in the newer-design cartridge.

Burkhanov was born and grew up in Tashkent (then part of the Russian Empire) in a strict Muslim family. In order to join the Uzbek drama theatre, which was founded in the 1920s, he had to leave home because his family's orthodox religious beliefs forbade acting. At the time Uzbek theatre was still in its infancy. In 1930 he received training at the Moscow Art Theatre, which he credited as enabling him to play classic roles such as Romeo, Hamlet, and ≈ídipus. Burkhanov was involved in Uzbek cinema from its very inception. The Uzbekfilm studio typecast him as a rebel who challenged the old order and traditions. In the early 1970s he was the subject of a documentary, People's Artist Shukur Burkhanov, narrated by fellow actor Boris Andreyev.

The story follows a woman who decides to exact revenge on the man who secretly poisoned her over forty years ago. Background The story is loosely-based on prenatal experiments conducted at Vanderbilt University, in which 700 pregnant women were given radioactive iron in order to see if radioactivity could pass through the placenta and affect the unborn children. (The experiments found that it could.)https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/books/review/Willett-t.html The women were given prenatal vitamin drinks and were unaware that the beverages contained radio active material. Author Elizabeth Stuckey-French said that she found out about the government-engineered radiation experiments upon discovering the book The Plutonium Files: America‚Äôs Secret Medical Experiments in the Cold War by Eileen Welsome at her local library.https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-exchange-elizabeth- stuckey-french-on-the-radioactive-lady Plot summary Marylou Ahearn temporarily moves from Memphis, Tennessee to Tallahassee, Florida to take an extended vacation. In actuality though, she is really there in order to find and murder retired doctor Wilson Spriggs. It is explained that in the 1950s, Dr. Spriggs was in charge of a medical experiment where pregnant woman were unknowingly given a vitamin cocktail with radioactive iron as part of a secret government study. Marylou was one of the patients who was given the cocktail in 1953. Though she did not know this until years later, the effects of the iron caused her to develop several health problems. Including for her daughter, Helen, to die from cancer at only eight years old. Once she gets to Tallahassee, Marylou goes by the pseudonym Nancy Archer from the film Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, and moves into a house on the edge of Dr. Spriggs' neighborhood. But she soon discovers that Wilson is now suffering from dementia, and has been relocated there to live with his daughter, Caroline. Deciding she needs a new approach, Marylou befriends Caroline's daughter and Wilson's youngest grandchild, Suzi, and soon gets to know the rest of the family. She then decides that instead of killing a man who no longer members his crimes, she should ruin his entire family. It turns out that Marylou will not have to make much effort. Caroline is going through a mid-life crisis, and is estranged by her husband, Vic. Their oldest daughter Ava has Asperger syndrome; along with a severe obsession with Elvis. Otis, their son, spends most of his time working in the family shed, and Suzi, the seemingly normal child, feels neglected in her own home. Marylou first takes Ava to a professional photographer since she wants to be on America's Next Top Model, and convinces her to take nude photographs for her application. She then tricks Suzi into going to a fundamentalist church run by her neighbor, Buff Coffey, as a way to encourage her to become a devout Christian. After seeing some of the experiments Otis is conducting in the shed, Marylou decides to report him to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Over time, Marylou begins to grow close to the Spriggs family, and regrets the ramifications of her actions. Suzi ends up getting molested by Buff, who also tried to make advances against her sister. Ava's naked pictures are uploaded online by the photographer. And Vic's work project is put in jeopardy when he and Marylou catch his employee Gigi tampering with their research findings. Caroline eventually discovers the truth about Marylou's real identity through old files about her father's research, and confronts her. Marylou explains that while she did intend to destroy their lives, she abandoned that idea because she realized that they were innocent people. Sometime after this, Buff regains support from the church for what happened with Suzi. Causing an outraged Marylou to give him a pineapple upside down cake mixed with poison. She then takes Wilson back to the clinic where they first met in hopes of jogging his memory. During the trip, she and Wilson form a connection over the past. When Caroline tracks them down, Marylou and her father tells them that they have decided to get married. Characters Marylou Ahearn- Marylou is the main protagonist of the story. She is approximately seventy-four years old at the beginning of the novel. Marylou was pregnant about three times in her life (the first two being miscarriages) from her ex-husband Teddy. Right before Helen's death, Marylou realizes that the medicine given to her by Wilson Spriggs could have caused her illness when she sees him at the same hospital where Helen is staying. Her theory is later proven true when she and dozens of other women are given settlements from the government. The money Marylou receives allows her to retire from her job as a teacher. Dr. Wilson Spriggs- Dr. Spriggs is the physician who gave Marylou the radioactive drug cocktail in 1953. Which was actually apart of a secret government study that used over hundreds of unknowing women as their test subjects. Wilson had his daughter Caroline with his first wife Martha, and was married to a woman named Verna Tommy up until her death three years ago. He moves in with his daughter's family after he starts experiencing memory problems.

History Necronomicon was founded in 1983 by band leader Volker \\"Freddy\\" Fredrich, Axel Strickstrock and Lars \\"Lala\\" Honeck. The band originally made punk rock, so in 1981 \\"Freddy\\" founded Total Rejection. This early Necronomicon phase was affected by bands including Discharge, The Exploited and GBH. Through the influence of Mot√∂rhead, Metallica and Slayer, their musical style soon would turn more into heavy metal. In 1985, the quartet signed their first record contract at GAMA Records. That was one year before guitarist J√ºrgen \\"Jogi\\" Weltin was engaged. The band released their debut album Necronomicon, still dressed in punk outfits on the cover. With a mixture of hard thrash with strong punk rock influences, they gained notoriety in the underground scene. In 1987, the second album, Apocalyptic Nightmare, was put on the market. On an Eastern Bloc tour that began in Austria and Hungary, the former Czechoslovakia to Russia, Necronomicon gained a large following. In the late 1980s the German thrash metal reached its peak period. Bands such as Kreator, Sodom and Destruction with \\"Freddy's\\" childhood friend Schmier attended national and international sensation. But Necronomicon had less success in this regard due to some major setbacks: After 1988, when the third album was released at Escalation GAMA Records, it came to financial inconsistencies on the part of the label. Necronomicon then separated from the management. As the label threatened with a legal dispute, the band agreed to give up their complete rights to the songs along with the band name for ten years. Necronomicon has also been forced not to sign any other record contract. In 1993 Necronomicon was able to re-sign a new record deal. The blocking time over ten years, which was declared by GAMA Records, now successfully had been challenged. But the joy of the new contract, now at D&S; Records, lasted only briefly. Although the album Screams was still mixed in 1994 under new management, D&S; Records surprisingly reported insolvency in the same year and broke all contact with the band. In addition, a fire destroyed the rehearsal room and a large part of the equipment. Necronomicon almost broke up. In early 2000, an unexpected thrash revival broke out on the international music scene. Bands such as Destruction or Exodus went on tour again and produced new albums. Also Necronomicon succeeded in March 2004 when the band completed a contract with the label Remedy Records (Germany) from Hamburg and the new CD named Construction of Evi\\" was brought to the market. But before that, the long-standing collaboration with guitarist Jogi had to be stopped because of his tinnitus. In 2007 Necronomicon signed a contract with the Spanish label Xtreem Music. The album Revenge of the Beast appeared. The CD was recorded as a special edition with a rougher mix of classic retro 1980s thrash in Neuenburg am Rhein. The European Tour in 2009 led to Greece, Spain and over to Russia. Drummer and founding member Axel Strickstrock resigned and was replaced by Klaus Enderlin. By the end of June 2013, Necronomicon was looking for permanent members playing the guitar and the bass. Benjamin \\"Ben Jay\\" Rogg and Marco Lohrenz completed Necronomicon. In this new formation Necronomicon played their first gig in the Czech Republic at the Aggressive Music Fest 2013 which was a full success for the new line-up. On 27 November 2015, the band released their album Pathfinder... Between Heaven and Hell on German label Trollzorn Records. Musical style Originally Necronomicon was a punk rock band, so the first demo recording Total Rejection is held in that appropriate style. Due to the influence of Mot√∂rhead, Metallica and Slayer a synthesis of the old style and the new metal influences was created. The band's style in the mid-1980s was described by the online magazine Metalize.Me as a mixture of Hellhammer and Sodom. Published in 1987 \\"Freddy\\" is unhappy with the album Apocalyptic Nightmare: ‚Äû...The songs are good, but the musicians haven't been mature enough to implement it adequately...\\". Construction of Evil (2004) was described by Martin of heavy Metal.de as \\"...fairly classical Heavy Metal of the old school and up-tempo power metal without prolonged double base- storm...\\". Musically, the band had remained faithful. The seventh album Invictus (2012), combines the 1980s 's style with contemporary elements. Metalize.Me said it sounds \\"...charming to rumble metal, but it does not rumble anymore...it's now played accurately...‚Äú. Martin of heavy Metal.de said that \\"Freddy's\\" rough vocals are a specific feature of the band and because of that Necronomicon stands out of the mass of power and heavy metal bands in Germany.

It is one of the few EU-based search engines with its own indexing engine. It claims that it does not employ user tracking or personalize search results in order to avoid trapping users in a filter bubble. The search engine is available in 26 languages. The website processes more than 10 million search requests per day and more than 50 million individual users a month worldwide, spread among its three main entry points: the normal homepage, a \\"light\\" version, and a \\"Qwant Junior\\" portal for children that filters results. During the development phase, Qwant searches were powered by Bing in addition to its own indexing capabilities. Qwant also confirmed the use of Bing advertising network. As of March 2019, Qwant is the 86th most visited website in France and the 1625th most visited website in the world.  Search engine  The search engine entered public beta on 16 February 2013, after two years of research and development. The first stable version was released on 4 July 2013. A new version was made available in April 2015. In October 2015, Qwant released Qwant Lite, a lighter and faster version of Qwant.com that is aimed at being user-friendly for those with older browsers and others who do not have powerful or resource-rich computers. Integrated features such as video playback and JavaScript were removed and the on-site content was streamlined. The design of this version mimics that of Google's minimalist interface. The child-friendly version was developed in cooperation with the French Ministry of Education. According to its founder, Qwant does not want to compete with Google, but prefers \\"to show something different\\". Users can create a free account, which allows posting on the \\"boards\\", a feature with functions similar to those of a social bookmarking platform. Earlier stand-out features, such as a knowledge graph (called the Qnowledge Graph) based on Wikipedia, seem to have been discontinued. In July 2016, Mozilla signed a deal with Qwant to allow them to distribute an officially sanctioned version of the Firefox web browser with Qwant as the default search engine. Currently, Qwant has a web browser based on Firefox on the Apple App Store available for iOS. When it was launched in 2017, the Brave web browser featured Qwant as one of its default search engines. In 2018, the French government decreed that all government searches be made using Qwant. In June 2019, Qwant launched Qwant Maps, an open source mapping service that uses the OpenStreetMap database to deliver privacy respecting maps and routing. It also unveiled Masq by Qwant, an open source technology that allows online services to offer personalized results from data securely stored on the user's device. In March 2019, Google added Qwant to the Chrome default search list for French users.  Company  The eponymous company behind the Qwant search engine was co-founded in February 2011 by Jean-Manuel Rozan, a financier; √âric Leandri, a specialist in computer security; and Patrick Constant, a search engine expert. It employs more than 160 people located in five French cities (Paris, Nice, Ajaccio, Rouen, and Epinal) and it has offices in Germany and Italy. The company states that it makes money through commissions it receives when users visit advertised websites, such as eBay and Tripadvisor, from its search results. From 2011 to 2014, Qwant acquired a total funding of ‚Ç¨3.5 million, part of it as a loan. In 2014, it received additional funding, including a ‚Ç¨6 million investment from Axel Springer Digital Ventures in return for a 20% stake in the company. In 2016 the European Investment Bank invested ‚Ç¨25 million.  Privacy  By virtue of being based in Europe, users gain some protection due to stringent European privacy laws. Qwant offers protections based on the new General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018. Qwant's Privacy Policy states that \\"as a principle, Qwant does not collect data about its users when they search\\". It claims not to use any cookie nor any other tracking technology. Qwant seems to take numerous technical precautions to limit third parties from gaining insight into user search queries. For example, image-search results are made by routing images through Qwant servers, so that the websites serving the images are not informed of the user's identity. Qwant struck a deal with the like-minded, privacy-centric keyboard, Fleksy, in 2018. That deal effectively created the most private search available in any messenger application. The website also states, in its privacy statement, that it resists French government surveillance: : \\"Regarding the French law on intelligence passed on 24 June 2015, we found that the recommendations of the CNIL had gained very little currency: as a search engine, we emphatically do not endorse the measures adopted, especially as they are particularly intrusive from the point of view of individual privacy. Accordingly, we will make every effort to ensure the protection of our users' personal data.\\"  Criticism  Shortly after the release, some observers expressed doubts about the nature of Qwant. According to them, Qwant might not really be a search engine, but simply a website aggregating results of other search engines such as Bing and Amazon, and that the \\"Qnowledge Graph\\" is based on Wikipedia. The company has rejected the reports and asserts that they do have their own Web crawler and used other search engines in their primary developmental phase only for semantic indexing related purposes. In June 2019, Qwant announced a partnership with Microsoft to power its own crawlers and algorithms using the Microsoft Azure cloud services while preserving the user's privacy. Microsoft said that Qwant \\"masters its technology, including its algorithm, its index and its client infrastructure, without collecting personal data, to better secure the respect for privacy of its users and the confidentiality of their searches\\". While respecting privacy, the terms of service state that these may be changed at any time: > Qwant reserves the right to unilaterally modify these terms of service to > adapt to the future developments of the site or its operation. The early versions of Qwant copied many design cues from Google.  Reception  The New York Times drew a comparison of Qwant to Quaero, an earlier attempt to create a European search engine to rival Google that shut down in 2013 after investments of more than ‚Ç¨250 million. Several French newspapers and news sites discussed Qwant just after its beta launch in February 2013 and its final launch in July 2013. * \\"Qwant.com - The new social search engine\\", en.kioskea.net * \\"Qwant, le moteur de recherche √† la fran√ßaise\\", france_info.fr * \\"Qwant : un moteur de recherche fran√ßais pour concurrencer Google\\", pcinpact.com * \\"Qwant : moteur de recherche fran√ßais √† la sauce sociale\\", zdnet.fr * \\"Qwant : moteur de recherche made in France\\", g√©n√©ration- nt.com * \\"Qwant, le nouveau moteur de recherche fran√ßais √† l‚Äôassaut de Google, Bing et Yahoo ?!\\", lejournaldunumerique.com * \\"Qwant.com, challenger de Google\\", le_nouvel_economiste.fr * \\"Qwant, le moteur de recherche fran√ßais, est lanc√©\\", futura-sciences.com * \\"Qwant, un nouveau moteur de recherche fran√ßais qui parcourt les r√©seaux sociaux\\", l'expansion.l'express.fr The service received public support from Emmanuel Macron, then Minister of the Economy and Finance and the future President of France.

Initial efforts to provide more learning opportunities focused on expanding and strengthening after-school and summer programs for children across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Mass 2020 launched Boston‚Äôs After-School for All Partnership, the largest public-private partnership in Boston‚Äôs history with over $26 million dedicated to children; the Keeping Kids on Track Statewide Campaign in partnership with the five largest United Way organizations in Massachusetts; the statewide Middle School Initiative in partnership with Citizen Schools and several private funders; the Transition to Success Pilot project; the School Sites Initiative, which is working with Boston schools; the After-School Literacy Coaching Initiative in Boston; and Partners for Student Success, now managed by Boston After School & Beyond.http://www.mass2020.org/node/21 In 2004, Mass 2020 partnered with a number of education and civic leaders to file an amicus brief in connection with the Hancock v. Driscoll school financing case, in which they argued that equity for poor school children came not only in the form of providing more money to equalize opportunity, but also more learning time. Mass 2020 then entered the field of education reform more directly when, in 2005, the Massachusetts Legislature funded planning grants for traditional district schools to convert to a school calendar and schedule that were up to 30 percent more hours (annually). This initiative became known as the Massachusetts Expanded Learning Time Initiative,Expanded Learning Time Schools, School Redesign - Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for which Mass 2020 provided intensive technical assistance to planning schools as well as advocacy and public policy support. The following year, the Legislature allocated $6.5 million for schools to significantly more hours to their school day and/or year, and Mass 2020 continued to provide technical assistance to the 10 implementing schools. The participating schools in the ELT Initiative have flexibility in how to use time, but are required to add time for core academic subjects, enrichment opportunities, and more planning and professional development time for teachers. The number of schools participating in the ELT Initiative has remained relatively stable since 2009. In school year 2012-2013, the grant supported 19 schools in 9 districts to add 300 hours to their school year. The ELT Initiative has grown into a model for other states; New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, included expanded learning time in his proposal which cited the MA ELT Initiative.Andrew Cuomo Unveils New York Education Agenda Governor Deval Patrick proposed substantially expanding the program over the next three years in his fiscal year 2014 budget, which was dependent on new tax revenue,.Governor Calls For Renewed Investment in Education The final fiscal year budget funds the ELT Initiative at $14.1 million. =Researching and Sharing Promising Practices= NCTL studies high-performing expanded-time schools and documents the key practices that contribute to their success through publications, webinars, convenings, and technical assistance sessions.

The federal government has adopted expanded learning time as an integral part of school reform, weaving it into the U.S. Department of Education‚Äôs school improvement programs, especially the School Improvement Grant, a Title I program. With broad support, expanded learning time also has been included in bipartisan education legislation, including the leading proposals to reauthorize the Time Matters in Education Act. =Engaging States and Districts= The TIME Collaborative: The Ford Foundation and NCTL joined together to launch the TIME CollaborativeProgram to offer longer school days expanding in Massachusetts, four other states - Boston.com on December 3, 2012 in Washington, DC.Longer school day?

Known by this name (or Bugby's Chapel) in reference to its Calvinistic founder William Bugby, it was also known as East Street Chapel and later, as it passed into the ownership of different religious groups, as Salem Unitarian Chapel, Salem Baptist Chapel and the Epsom and District Synagogue. More than 200 years of religious use ended when it was converted into an office. The chapel is a Grade II Listed building. History Epsom became a fashionable town in the 18th century, popular with businesspeople and wealthy merchants from London who wanted to live in a country town within easy reach of the city. Protestant Nonconformism emerged in the town soon after the Act of Uniformity 1662, when covert Presbyterian meetings took place; a chapel was built in 1724, and hundreds of worshippers attended. It was an era in which congregations frequently split and new churches were formed in accordance with the views of their ministers, and such a secession occurred in the 1770s when William Bugby, a preacher with strong Calvinistic views, came to Epsom. He was influenced by the well-known ultra- Calvinist William Huntington, who moved to Ewell in 1775 after experiencing a religious conversion and held meetings there. Bugby took out certificates for the registration of religious meeting houses in Epsom in 1777 and 1778. The chapel was erected in 1779. Strict Baptists used Bugby Chapel until 1951, when this brick-built church was built elsewhere in the town. In 1779, Bugby bought a plot of land \\"on a narrow lane behind the [then] main London Road\\" and erected a chapel. A house, later called Rose Cottage, was attached to this, and there was a burial ground to the northeast. William Huntington's name was recorded in the registers there in that year as one of the ministers who had conducted baptisms. Bugby was then invited to preach in Brockham, near Dorking, in 1780; his meetings were successful, and a chapel was built in 1783. Like the chapel in Epsom, its character was Independent Calvinistic. (Such worship was \\"closely associated with Surrey\\" in the 18th and 19th centuries; other chapels established for preachers with these views include Providence Chapel at Charlwood, founded in 1816). From 1783 until his death in 1792, Bugby ministered at both the Epsom and the Brockham chapel. He also registered other places of worship in Surrey villages such as Effingham, Leigh and Betchworth. The nature of worship at the chapel in its early years was not well understood: the Anglican vicar of Epsom stated in 1788 that \\"a few years ago a gardener ... collected money enough to build a small [meeting] house, where he now has a small and uncertain congregation of Methodists ... they are chiefly people of the lowest class\\". Also at this time, the name of the chapel was not fixed: Bugby Chapel or Bugby's Chapel were used, but East Street Chapel, Little Chapel and the Old Huntingtonian Chapel were also recorded. Calvinistic meetings continued at Bugby Chapel until 1825 or 1837, the date at which its baptismal and marriage registers were lodged at Somerset House in London. Events later in the 19th century are not clearly documented, although in the Government's religious census of 1851 it was recorded as a meeting place for Calvinistic Protestants. Attendance was said to be 30 to 40 people, and the Handbook of Epsom published in 1860 mentioned that \\"Joseph Irons [a preacher from a chapel at Camberwell] used occasionally to preach there\\". In 1889, the chapel took on a new guise as a Strict Baptist chapel when new trustees were appointed. The name Salem Chapel was adopted. The 1894 Ordnance Survey map identified it as Salem Unitarian Chapel, but it was reconstituted as Strict Baptist in 1896. A new trustees' document was produced on 17 August 1899, and thereafter the chapel was identified as Baptist on maps. Permanent pastors served between 1923 and 1932 and from 1944 onwards. A new chapel was built on the Dorking Road for the congregation in 1951; the \\"very nicely designed and fitted place of worship\\" opened on 30 June 1951, and Bugby Chapel was vacated. After a short period of disuse, the chapel came back into religious use in 1954 when it was converted into the Epsom and District Synagogue. Hans Leo Lehmann (1907‚Äì1992), a German-born chemist, moved to Epsom in 1940 and started small-scale meetings for Jewish worship in his house in Woodcote Road in May 1941. Services were later held at a building in Church Street, the Lecture Hall of Epsom Congregational Church and the Foresters' Hall, but in 1954 Lehmann acquired the freehold of the former Bugby Chapel. It was reconsecrated as a synagogue in October 1954 by Dr M. Lew, and local Jews invested their own time and money in converting the building into a synagogue. It was registered for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and was given the Worship Register Number 64502. Membership of the synagogue reached 28 in 1960, but Epsom's Jewish community was always small and the congregation was already in decline when Lehmann‚Äîalways the \\"leading member\\" and chief organiser of the synagogue‚Äîdied in 1992. By 1993 there were only 13 members, and the congregation decided to join the synagogue in nearby Sutton. In 1994, the building was converted into an office with the name The Meeting House. The chapel was designated a Grade II Listed building on 20 May 1975. The adjoining Rose Cottage was no longer associated with the chapel after 1843, when it became a private house, and it was demolished in 1978. Architecture Bugby Chapel is a simple single- storey building in the Classical style. The walls are of brick with a later covering of stucco. Above the brick cornice the roof is hipped on each of the four sides, creating a hidden central \\"valley\\", and is laid with tiles. The fa√ßade faces south and is of three symmetrical bays with centrally placed panelled double doors below a gabled hood mould. This has a tiled roof of its own and is flanked by bargeboards. The left and right bays have tall round- arched windows with original metal bars. There are similar windows in the north wall, and the east wall has two blank windows. No original features survive inside. The interior dimensions are . Burial ground There are several gravestones and a marble memorial in the burial ground next to the chapel. There are ten gravestones and monuments in the small burial ground to the east of the chapel. The first is a headstone and accompanying footstone, neither with any inscription. Next is a headstone commemorating Mary Gillam (d. 1867) and her husband James (d. 1870). The Swann family‚ÄîGeorge (d. 1849), Charlotte (d. 1874) and Charlotte junior (d. 1884)‚Äîare listed on the next headstone, which measures and which has a footstone bearing their initials. The next measures and names Ann Snashall (n√©e Inglefield; d. 1858), two infant children and her father James Inglefield (d. 1864). Smaller and partly illegible, the next gravestone () commemorates Elizabeth Sloper (d. 1846?). Thomas Ellis (d. 1798) is named on a headstone, next to which is another measuring headstone which commemorates members of the Humphrey family: Mary (d. 1852) and John (d. 1866), five children who died between 1820 and 1854, and a grandchild (d. 1872). On the next headstone, William Bugby himself (d. 1792?) is commemorated alongside his wife Mary (d. 1787). The same Thomas Ellis (d. 1798) appears again on a pedimented monument of white marble which was taken from the chapel and placed against the east wall; it measures . Next to this stands a headstone which names Joseph Weller (d. 1864), his wife Maria (d. 1859) and their son Joseph junior (d. 1851); this also has a footstone with their initials.

She gave many concerts in Britain, all known ones consisting of her own works, and all with herself at the piano. Her works were also played in concerts of which she was not a part, by the Brosa and Kutcher String Quartets, among others, and ‚Äúmany distinguished British singers have featured her songs.‚Äù In 1939 or 1940, Servine returned to New York.

March, 1941. The performers included the Roth Quartet and herself at the piano. The concert was well received, garnering several positive reviews from major New York newspapers. In the New York Sun review, she was described as a ‚Äúvigorous person of middle years‚Äù. F. D. Perkins, writing in the New-York Tribune shortly after the concert, described her music as showing ‚Äúsolid and well-schooled musicianship and knowledge of form and of generosity in regard to melody‚Äù. Her style was ‚Äúpervaded by the atmosphere of late nineteenth century romanticism‚Ä¶[it occasionally called to mind] Brahms and Cesar Frank, or‚Ä¶MacDowell. The B flat quintet had one rising phrase in the strings which recalled Wagner‚Äù. In the early 1940s, Servine married American Malcolm Dougherty, and around the year 1945 they moved together to Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Her song cycle ‚ÄúThe Year‚Äù was captioned ‚ÄúGreat Barrington, 1945‚Äù. She lived there until her death in 1972. Her last known work is a draft of a Prelude for two pianos, dated October 28-November 1, 1972. In 1973, her husband donated the collection to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.  Works  Marthe Servine composed symphonies, concertos, operas, choral works (both with and without orchestra), chamber works for various combinations of instruments and for solo instruments, and over 400 songs. She does not appear to have made any recordings. Her few published works are: =Songs= * Brahma * The call * A drinking song * How sweet I roamed * Identity =Solo piano works= * Prelude & fugue * Sonata in D minor =Choral= * Rune of Hospitality  Compositional style  Several of the reviewers remarked on the composer's surprisingly conservative style and rich sonorities. The Musical America reviewer, known only by the initial \\"C.,\\" states that \\"The music heard on this occasion follows both traditional structural models and the traditional melodic feeling of the later Romantic school...the composer approached her group of instruments from the standpoint of orchestral coloring and the opulent sonorities achieved added a general lushness of effect to the melodic element\\". Her works were viewed very positively by most, including J.B of the New York Post, who said \\"Madame Servine, judging by yesterday afternoon's offerings, just misses being a great composer\\". One reviewer, however was critical, stating that, with regard to her sonata for violin and piano (Sonata in B minor), \\"the length was excessive for the material, the emotion never quite realized in sound\\".  Pianistic style  Servine was considered to be an accomplished pianist by the reviewers of her 1941 concert. The reviewer from Musical America known as C. said that she ‚Äúproved to be a pianist of noteworthy virility of style, with an entirely adequate technique and the command of a rich warm tone‚Äù. Noel Straus of the New York Times said that she ‚Äúplayed these works‚Ä¶with the same vitality and warmth, the same richness of tonal effects, reflected in her compositions‚Ä¶.[She gave] the works readings that searchingly unfolded the full intentions of [the compositions].‚Äù  Known concerts  All of the following concerts are documented by concert programs in the New York Public Library's Marthe Servine Manuscripts collection * 1919, March 8 ‚Äì at Aeolian Hall, New York.

It was the first county seat of Young County and was located across from Fort Belknap.Baker, T. Lindsay. Ghost Towns of Texas. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1986. Google Books. Web. 19 Aug. 2013. History Belknap was built about one-half mile east of Fort Belknap. In 1856, it became Young County's first county seat and acquired a post office on August 14. The townspeople traded with the fort and travelers. Beginning in 1858, the Butterfield-Overland Mail ran a trail through the town. By that time, 150 people lived in Belknap, and the town included a saloon, the post office, and several stores. During the Civil War, the population plummeted. The fort was largely abandoned and the residents feared Indian attacks. On November 5, 1866, the post office halted operations. In 1867, federal troops returned to the fort, but abandoned it 5 months later due to low water in the area. By 1870, only 70 people lived in Belknap. The post office returned on January 20, 1874. However, later that year, Graham became the new county seat. The military post closed its doors in 1876. By 1880, only 40 people remained in the town, but the post office wasn't disbanded until 1908. While the fort was restored in 1936, the town was never recreated. Today, the graveyard and a few houses are all that remains of the town.Chenoweth, Henry. \\"Belknap - Texas Ghost Town.\\" Ghost Towns. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Aug. 2013.

All officially licensed NTSC-U and PAL region cartridges are 13.3 cm (5.25 inches) tall, 12 cm (4.75 inches) wide and 2 cm (0.75 inches) thick. Early NES Game Paks are held together with 5 small, slotted screws. Games released after 1987, designated \\"Rev-A\\" on the back label, were redesigned slightly to incorporate two plastic clips molded into the plastic itself, eliminating the need for the top two screws. This is why older NES carts are referred to as \\"5-screw\\" and are distinguishable by their flat tops and five screws instead of three. Around this time, the standard screws were changed to 3.8 mm security screws to further secure the ROMs inside from tampering. The back of the cartridge bears a label with instructions on handling, explaining that the cartridge is not to be stored in extreme temperatures, not to be immersed in water, and not to be cleaned with benzene, thinner, alcohol, or other such solvents. These labels are gray for standard games and gold (or in rare cases silver) for games that feature battery-powered storage. Production and software revision codes were imprinted as stamps on the back label to correspond with the software version and producer. With the exception of The Legend of Zelda and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, which are available as gold plastic Game Paks, all licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard shade of gray plastic. Unlicensed cartridges were produced in black (Tengen, American Video Entertainment, and Wisdom Tree), robin egg blue (Color Dreams and Wisdom Tree), silver and gold (Camerica), gray (American Game Cartridges), white (Caltron), and clear (Active Enterprises) which bear a slightly different shape and style than a vintage Nintendo-licensed NES Game Pak. Nintendo also produced yellow-plastic carts for internal use at Nintendo Service Centers, although these were never made available for purchase by consumers. The largest officially licensed Game Pak size is 768KB for Kirby's Adventure. Famicom cartridges are shaped slightly differently, measuring only 7.0 cm (2.75 inches) in length, and 10.8 cm (4.25 inches) in width. The NES uses a 72-pin interface and the Famicom uses a 60-pin design. Some early NES games, most commonly Gyromite, include 60-pin Famicom PCBs and ROMs with a built-in converter. Unlike the predominantly gray colored NES Game Paks, official Famicom cartridges were produced in many colors of plastic. Adaptors, similar in design to the popular accessory Game Genie, are available that allow Famicom games to be played on an NES. 60-pin vs. 72-pin The Famicom, the Japanese version of the NES, has a 60-pin cartridge design. This yields smaller cartridges than the NES, which has a 72-pin design. Four pins are used for the 10NES lockout chip. Ten pins were added that connect a cartridge directly to the expansion port on the bottom of the unit. Finally, two pins that allow cartridges to provide their own sound expansion chips were removed. Some early NES cartridges house the same printed circuit boards as their Famicom counterparts, using a converter (such as the T89 Cartridge Converter) to allow them to fit inside the internally compatible NES hardware. Nintendo did this to reduce costs and inventory by using the same PCBs in North America and Japan. The cartridge dimensions of the original Famicom measure at 10.8 √ó 6.9 cm, compared with 10.4 √ó 14 cm for its North American redesign. External sound chips The Famicom has two cartridge pins that were originally intended to facilitate the Disk System's own sound chip, but are also used by cartridge games to provide sound enhancements. In the design of the NES, these pins were removed from the cartridge port and relocated to the bottom expansion port. As a result, individual cartridges can not make use of this audio functionality, and many NES localizations have technologically inferior sound compared to their equivalent Famicom versions, such as Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse. Third-party manufacturing In Japan, Konami, Namco, Bandai, Taito, Irem, Jaleco, and Sunsoft manufactured their own game cartridges for the Famicom. This allowed these companies to design their own customized chips for specific purposes, such as the increased sound quality of Konami's VRC 6 and VRC 7 chips. Internationally, all licensed NES cartridges were made by Nintendo except Konami and Acclaim, who produced their own PCBs, but used Nintendo's provided gray cartridge shells.

In 2020, CC relocated from The Strip District to its permanent location on Butler Street in the Lawrenceville neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The organization offers cutting-edge exhibitions focus on multi-cultural diversity and social justice., artist-led, hands-on workshops, and a store featuring handcrafted art objects by artists from across the United States. CC is free admission and open to the public. Between three and four exhibits are displayed annually in CC's main gallery and bring in approximately 35,000 visitors. Another 100,000 visit the Satellite Gallery at One Mellon Center that was opened in 1990. This second gallery is located in the Pittsburgh Steel Plaza T-station and allows those working downtown the opportunity to experience art. CC is nonprofit, aiming to bring arts to the community. It provides as much free access and programs as possible. In addition to the current exhibits and various studio workshops, CC reaches out into the community and focuses on at-risk youth, seniors in assisted living, and those living in homeless shelters. History CC was founded in 1971 by Elizabeth Rockwell Raphael Contemporary Craft ‚Äì Elizabeth Rockwell Raphael Interview in the belief that contemporary artists had new things to say with traditional materials, and that they needed wider opportunities to exhibit and sell their work. Since then, CC has organized more than 230 exhibitions and has established a satellite gallery and a permanent collection. CC also offers a range of studio classes, community outreach programs, and a retail store. Elizabeth ‚ÄúBetty‚Äù Rockwell Raphael, who has been called one of the most groundbreaking women in the arts was the first to transform the Pittsburgh arts scene. Before its foundation in 1971, Raphael opened a small art gallery in 1941 making the first modern art gallery Pittsburgh had ever seen. She introduced a new vision of art to the city and created what is now one of the only organizations in the country that focuses solely on craft media. In 2010, CC was named a \\"Champion in Action\\" in the community arts category by Citizens Bank and WPXI-TV, and received a $25,000 grant for ‚Äúoffering cutting-edge exhibitions focused on multicultural diversity and non-mainstream art, as well as a range of classes and community outreach programs,‚Äù said Ralph J, Papa, Chairman of Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania. In 2018, CC received the Award of Distinction from American Craft Council. This award recognizes an organization, institution, corporation, or individual who has made significant contributions to the field of craft with a minimum of 25 years of service. CC was the first organization to receive this award in Pittsburgh, PA.

Name The origin of the name \\"Pilat\\" is uncertain. The word may have a Latin origin (Mons Pileatus). Another legend says that the body of Pontius Pilate was buried in the massif. For a long time Mont Pilat designated the main mountain, with the double peaks or crests (cr√™ts) of Perdrix and Oeillon. Modern maps generally designate this area as Les Cr√™ts. However, the Conseil sup√©rieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) continues to use the term Mont Pilat to refer to the television transmitter on the Cr√™t de l'Oeillon. The whole mountain range is commonly called Mont Pilat. The Communaut√© de communes des Monts du Pilat coordinates various administrative and developmental functions for the communes in the massif. The term Pilat is also used to refer to the area that became the Parc naturel r√©gional du Pilat in 1974. Topography Location of the Pilat in the Massif Central The Pilat massif is part of the French Massif Central range. It lies in the extreme east of the range looking over the Rhone valley. The overall orientation of the massif is from south-west to north-east, creating a variety of climates. The massif generally rises about above its surroundings. Perdrix (Partridge mountain) rises to above sea level and Pyfara and Pan√®re are high. Pilat is separated from the Monts du Lyonnais to the north by the Saint-√âtienne basin, the Gier valley. The Gier rises at La Jasserie on the Perdrix mountain at about . The river runs along the north side of the massif for before joining the Rhone at Givors. The Gier receives the Janon from its left at Saint- Chamond. The Janon from Terrenoire (now part of Saint-√âtienne) to Saint- Chamond and then the Gier from Saint-Chamond to Givors create a valley in the coal basin that runs between the Pilat massif and the Riverie chain of the Monts du Lyonnais. Climate Pilat has a wide variety of plants, reflecting different climate zones in a relatively small area. The Rhone valley on the south of the massif has a warm Mediterranean climate. Fruit trees and vineyards are cultivated on the south-facing slopes. On the north side there is a cooler continental climate, with conifers, juniper and ferns. There is heavy snow in the winter. On the crests, the altitude, winds and snow prevent the growth of trees. Vegetation includes heath plants such as heather and bilberry. History Aqueduct of the Gier at Chaponost Flint and pottery found in the municipality of Saint-Genest-Malifaux show that humans were present in pre-historic times. During the Celtic era the Pilat was shared by two Celtic peoples, the Segusiavi and the Allobroges. They gave the region the name Pilat, meaning broad mountain (pi: mountain and lat: broad). The Celts also left many places of worship, arrangements of stones such as those at Ch√¢teau de Belize above Chuyer, the Rock Altar Roisey and La Garde, the sacred precincts of Saint-Sabin and the peak of the Three Teeth, and especially the \\"Menhir du Flat\\" near Colombier. In Roman times the water of the river Gier was supplied to Lyon through the aqueduct of the Gier. The water was collected above Saint-Chamond and routed through tunnels, of which there are remains at Chagnon and Saint-Martin-la-Plaine, and aqueducts such as the one at Chaponost. During the Roman era Pilat formed the border between the provinces of Gallia Narbonensis and Gallia Lugdunensis. There are remains of Roman roads in places such as P√©lussin and Saint-R√©gis-du-Coin. On 1 November 1944 a U.S. Army Douglas C-47 Skytrain crashed due to bad weather carrying five crew members, army nurse lieutenant Aleda E. Lutz and fifteen wounded of whom some were German prisoners. There were no survivors. It took several hours for help to arrive. The crash occurred in the hollow of La Botte not far from La Jasserie, where a monument was raised in 2002 commemorating the accident. Administration Map of the Pilat massif The Pilat is mostly located in the Loire department southeast of the city of Saint-√âtienne and southwest of the cities of Vienne and Givors. The massif is bordered by the departments of Rh√¥ne, Is√®re, Ard√®che and Haute-Loire. The communes of the Communaut√© de communes des Monts du Pilat are Bourg-Argental, Burdignes, Colombier, Graix, Jonzieux, La Versanne, Le Bessat, Marlhes, Planfoy, Saint-Genest-Malifaux, Saint-Julien-Molin-Molette, Saint-R√©gis-du-Coin, Saint-Romain-les-Atheux, Saint-Sauveur-en-Rue, Tarentaise and Th√©lis-la-Combe. Attractions Le saut du Gier waterfall on the Gier Sainte-Croix-en-Jarez lies in northern Pilat. Once it was a fortified 13th century monastery, but after the French Revolution it became a village. The high country around the Cr√™t de la Perdrix and the Cr√™t de l'≈íillon is popular for cross-country skiing in the winter. The region is attractive to motorcyclists, with winding roads leading through bright valleys and deep forests, and with magnificent views of the Alps and the Massif Central. The Saut du Gier waterfall near the head of the Gier is in the Pilat Regional Natural Park. It is a trickle in the summer, but a waterfall in autumn and spring. The Pierre des Trois √©v√™ques (Three Bishops' Stone) is in the commune of Saint-R√©gis-du-Coin. It marked the meeting point of three provinces of Roman Gaul: Lyon, Narbonne and Aquitaine. Under Charlemagne the stone marked the point where Aquitaine, Provence and Burgundy met, and was used as a reference point during the partition of the empire in 843 AD. In the Middle Ages it delineated the Archdioceses of Lyon, Vienna and Puys. The Pierre Saint-Martin (Saint Martin's Stone) is located near Mont Chaussitre. According to legend, Saint Martin of Tours left his mark here when he moved. Since then, according to local belief, the stone would be able to help young children to walk.

Caldwell (born 1936), is a retired Church of Christ minister in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who was a Republican member of the Arkansas State Senate from 1969 to 1978, the first member of his party to sit in the legislative upper chamber in the 20th century. His first two years as a senator corresponded with the second two-year term of Winthrop Rockefeller, the first Republican governor of Arkansas since Reconstruction. Caldwell was closely allied with Rockefeller during the 1969-1970 legislative sessions. Background A native of Dardanelle in Yell County in west central Arkansas, Caldwell was a son of Reece E. Caldwell (1912-1971) and the former Oval Ermice Greene (1914-2000). He attended the first eleven years of school in Dardanelle but completed his senior year at Central High School in Tulsa. In 1958, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in general studies from the Church of Christ-affiliated Harding College in Searcy in White County, Arkansas. He received a Master of Science from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, and pursued but did not complete doctoral studies at the private University of Tulsa. He became a minister in 1956, and while a state senator, he was the minister at the Southside Church of Christ in Rogers in Benton County in northwestern Arkansas. He began after-dinner speaking before church and civic groups. For eight years before his return to Arkansas from Oklahoma, Caldwell served on stand-by in the Oklahoma Air National Guard. Arkansas legislative politics A Democrat-turned-Republican, Caldwell first won the general election for state senator for Benton and Carroll counties in 1968, when he unseated the veteran Democratic incumbent, Russell Elrod (1904-1985) of Siloam Springs, who in the 1953-1954 session had been the Senate President Pro Tempore. Although he was considered a \\"progressive\\" or a Moderate Republican within the legislature, Caldwell recalled years later that he really had \\"no ideology, no issue when I first ran. I just thought a two-party system was a good idea. I don't recall any of us [Republican legislators] having an agenda. ... Usually when the candidates get to town, they see the big picture, and they understand they have to deal with issues that don't just apply to their home district.\\" In 1969, Caldwell joined two other senators who defended the right of Muhammad Ali, the African American boxer who converted to Islam and avoided military service in the Vietnam War, to speak at the student forum at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. \\"I don't agree with him, but he should be heard,\\" explained Caldwell. Democratic Senator Milt Earnhart of Fort Smith introduced a resolution to condemn Ali's appearance, and Republican Lieutenant Governor Maurice Britt declared that the resolution had passed by a voice vote. In his speech Ali stunned many when he spoke highly of former Governor George C. Wallace of Alabama, who the year before had won forty-six electoral votes, including the six from Arkansas, as the nominee of the American Independent Party, only to lose the 1968 presidential election to Richard M. Nixon. Ali discussed racial segregation and said that he understood why whites in the American South as late as the early 20th century had lynched blacks who had molested white women. Ali further urged African-American men to protect black women.The Northwest Arkansas Times, Fayetteville, Arkansas, March 13, 1969, p. 1. In the 1969 legislative session, Caldwell followed Rockefeller's lead in supporting the legalization of the sale of mixed drinks when approved through local option. As a minister, Caldwell lectured against the use of liquor, but as a senator he urged that the matter be resolved at the local level.Cathy K. Urwin, Agenda for Reform: Winthrop Rockefeller as Governor of Arkansas, 1967-71 (Fayetteville, Arkansas: University of Arkansas Press, 1991), p. 122. In 1972 and 1974, Caldwell topped two other Democrats, Bill Nelson of Rogers and Rex Bolin, an insurance agent from Bentonville, to secure terms of two yearsHalf of the state Senate runs for a two-year term after redistricting in years ending in \\"2\\"; the other half runs for a regular four-year term; that way, only half of the Senate is contested every two years. and then four years, respectively.State of Arkansas, Membership list, Arkansas State Senate State Republican chairman From 1973 to 1974, Senator Caldwell was also the Arkansas Republican chairman during a particularly bleak period for his party.Arkansas Outlook (state Republican newspaper), November/December 1968; Springdale News, Springdale, Arkansas, July 1, 1973, Arkansas Outlook, May 1973. In March 1973, a month after Rockefeller's death, Caldwell was elected as chairman to succeed Charles T. Bernard of Earle in Crittenden County in eastern Arkansas. Bernard had lost the 1968 race for the U.S. Senate to incumbent Democrat J. William Fulbright in what turned out to have been Fulbright's last successful election. In this role, Caldwell opposed fielding \\"sacrificial lambs\\"In 1976, for example, the GOP offered as its gubernatorial nominee, Leon Griffith, a politically unknown master plumber then from Pine Bluff, who was crushed in the general election by Governor David Pryor. Griffith was a placeholder on the ballot. Caldwell expressed doubt that the GOP could win the governorship again for at least six years.Arkansas Outlook, May 1973 Jack Bass and Walter DeVries write that in 1974 the Arkansas GOP was seeking a new political personality in the post- Rockefeller era. Bass/DeVries speculated that the GOP could be revived: \\"Continued urbanization and economic growth should enable the Republicans to remain viable as an alternative if the Democrats drift from moderation.\\"Jack Bass and Walter DeVries, The Transformation of Southern Politics: Social Change and Political Consequence Since 1945 (New York City: Basic Books, 1976), p. 105. A defender of the embattled President Nixon, Caldwell questioned whether the Watergate disclosures would have much impact on the Arkansas GOP because of the lack of political opportunities then available within the state. Caldwell called upon Republicans to continue to recruit African-American voters and Independents, something Rockefeller had pursued with considerable success in the short term.Arkansas Outlook, May 1973; Caldwell was correct in his prediction that his party would not regain the governorship until 1980, when Frank D. White temporarily derailed Governor Bill Clinton. Caldwell said that many in his party were not \\"thinking in practical terms. We're busy debating issues that don't elect anybody.\\" The Arkansas GOP, he said at the time, was in \\"a serious adjustment period\\" since Rockefeller's death in February 1973.Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report, October 26, 1974, p. 2960 In 1974, the GOP had organizations in just seventeen of the seventy-five Arkansas counties. The party supported its staff with occasional fundraising in the amount of $143,000 in 1973. The Republicans lost their best issue with the demise of the \\"Old Guard\\" Democrats, epitomized by former Governor Orval Faubus. Caldwell said that he believed that the GOP could nevertheless win with \\"the right candidate ... under the right circumstances.\\"Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report, October 26, 1974, p. 2960 In December 1974, Caldwell stepped down as state chairman and was succeeded by Lynn Lowe, a farmer in Miller County near Texarkana, who ran in 1966 for the United States House of Representatives against David Pryor and carried the Republican gubernatorial banner in 1978 against Bill Clinton. In 1975, Lowe speculated that Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, an older brother of Winthrop Rockefeller, had retained support within the Arkansas GOP because of \\"the feelings for his brother,\\"Arkansas Outlook, October 1975 but Nelson Rockefeller soon removed himself for consideration to a full term and was replaced on the unsuccessful 1976 Republican ticket by Robert J. Dole of Kansas. Like his legislative colleague Danny L. Patrick of Madison County and the GOP functionary Len Blaylock of Perry County, Caldwell recalls having become personally friendly with Orval Faubus, whom he met in 1970 during the unsuccessful Rockefeller reelection campaign. Sitting Governor Jim Guy Tucker delivered the main address as Faubus' body lay in state at the Arkansas capitol.\\"Orval Faubus is dead at 84\\", Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, December 15, 1994 Later years Caldwell did not seek reelection in 1978 and was succeeded by the Democrat, later Republican convert, Kim Hendren of Gravette in Benton County. Kim Hendren is a brother-in-law of former U.S. Senator Tim Hutchinson and former U.S. Representative nd current Governor Asa Hutchinson. Hendren himself lost a bid in 2010 for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate to John Boozman, who went on to unseat the Democrat Blanche Lincoln. From 1987 to 1988, Caldwell served as chief of staff in the Tulsa office of James M. Inhofe who at that time had been elected to his first term as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Oklahoma's 1st congressional district. In 2003, Caldwell was honored at a dinner by then Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for Caldwell's role in sponsoring legislation during the 1970s to expand the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at Little Rock. Caldwell said that as an Oklahoma voter he usually voted for Republican candidates but declined to back the party's nominee for state attorney general in 2010 because that successful candidate, Scott Pruitt, campaigned against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\\"Obamacare\\"). \\"A conservative Republican in Arkansas would be a liberal over here,\\" Caldwell jokingly said of the political climate in Oklahoma. Mark Darr, the Republican elected lieutenant governor of Arkansas in 2010, also campaigned against the Democrat health care law. Pruitt in 2017 joined the Donald Trump administration as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Winthrop Rockefeller had few members of his own party to guide his programs through the legislature. Eleven of Rockefeller vetoes were overridden, far more than for other Arkansas governors in a four-year period.Diane Divers Blair (1938-2000) and Jay L. Barth (born 1939), Arkansas Government and Politics, 2nd ed. (Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2005), p. 71. The fate of Rockefeller programs rested with the Democratic legislators, one of whom, Arkansas House Speaker Sterling R. Cockrill of Little Rock, provided assistance to Rockefeller and in 1970 even joined the Republican Party to run for lieutenant governor on Rockefeller's ticket when Maurice Britt stepped down.\\"The Conscience of an Arkansan,\\" Pamphlet from the 1970 Sterling Cockrill for Lieutenant Governor campaign After Rockefeller's defeat in 1970 and death barely two years later, the state GOP apparatus returned to the control of the mostly unknown partisans, a few of whom had previously been active in the party. Republicans in Arkansas found it difficult to function without Rockefeller's financial support. As time passed, one might conclude that the state GOP made only minimal progress in its political mission though some of the programs were adopted under Rockefeller and in subsequent administrations beginning with his immediate successor, Dale Bumpers, and then David Pryor. In time, the GOP moved beyond Rockefeller's moderate stance to a more conservative governing philosophy than that which Rockefeller and Caldwell had championed.Blair and Barth, Arkansas Politics and Government, pp. 71-72.

In 1894, he injured a finger, preventing him from pursuing a career as a violinist. However, he still had one musical passion ‚Äî singing. At the end of 1894, Vasily Petrov became a chorister with the Kharkov Cathedral. In 1895 he joined a provincial Ukrainian private Opera company, fulfilling his wish to become an operatic artist. In 1898, one of his friends asked the Directorate of the Moscow Conservatory about interviewing Vasily Petrov. Consequently, Petrov was immediately enrolled to study at the Moscow Conservatory under supervision of Anton Bartzal (). He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1902 and was immediately accepted into the Moscow Imperial Troup (Bolshoi Theatre) where he performed in concerts. In 1899, Petrov, who was still merely a student in the first stage of his course, replaced the ill Chaliapin as Dosifey in the opera Khovanshchina in Mamontov's Private Russian Opera company. Thus began the friendship of the two great Russian bass singers.

Troma ran a script-writing contest that invited fans to contribute two pages with a weekly winner announced and added to the collective screenplay. Despite a script being finished in 2000, this project never got past the pre-production stage. Troma again announced production of the sequel in October 2011. Initially, it was stated the film would be made in Spain by Mushnik's Entertainment in collaboration with Chaparra Entertainment. The directors were to be Marc Gras and Dani Moreno. The plot centered around a new group of Cretins who are forced into the role of the protagonists. However, this version also never came to fruition. After Anchor Bay had shown interest in remaking some of the films from Troma's library, Troma started talking to them about doing a co-production. Anchor Bay ended up remaking Troma's Mother's Day while serving as co-producers on a Class of Nuke 'Em High reboot, which became the fourth installment of the Nuke 'Em High series during pre-production. =Filming= Kaufman began production anew in 2012, directing the film himself in New York and New Jersey.

Principal photography began in August 2012 and finished in September. Release Initially slated to be a single installment, Kaufman split the film into two volumes, much like The Toxic Avengers 2 and 3, after director Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs suggestion, √† la Kill Bill. Return to Nuke 'Em High Volume 1 began a limited North American theatrical release in the fall of 2013, beginning with a screening at the Museum of Modern Art.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 57% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Variety deemed it \\"a hearty blast of Troma-branded schlock\\" while The New York Times said Kaufman fans \\"will be delighted to learn that time has eroded neither his love of nudity nor his disdain for political correctness.\\" The New York Post praised the film for its \\"hilarious series of parodies: Carrie, Soylent Green, Glee, Cat Ballou, you name it.\\" Horror magazine Fangoria gave the film 3.5 out of 4 skulls, calling it \\"undeniably funny, brave and so unlike anything put out today that it practically demands respect.\\" Sequel Kaufman shot Return to Return to Nuke 'Em High AKA Volume 2 with Paredes, Corcoran, and Amico reprising their leading roles. A Kickstarter campaign was set up to raise $50,000 for post- production costs. The campaign ended on June 24, 2015, successfully raising $63,615. The sequel premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2017, with an Los Angeles premiere on March 8, 2018 at the Ahrya Fine Arts Theater in Beverly Hills, California.

It focuses on defense and homeland security products, technologies and services. Currently it has more than 100 employees and 200 contractors. In addition to groups of security teams working in several areas of the world and a fleet of operator support vessels in the Indian Ocean, the company has both a mission operations center and a threat analysis center. Until July 2013, it published weekly global piracy threat analysis, available without charge on its website. In October 2013 Indian government agencies impounded AdvanFort's and arrested the crew and 25 guards aboard for being in international waters with a permit from the ships flag state 'Sierra Leone' carrying arms, and for legally obtaining fuel and chicken.  Company  AdvanFort is a US private maritime security company. It is a signatory with the International Code of Conduct (ICoC) for Pirate Security Providers, and certified with the International Maritime Law Enforcement Academy (IMLEA) The company also belongs to the Security Association for the Maritime Industry (SAMI). It is headquartered in Herndon, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., and also has offices in Turkey, Japan and South Korea, among other countries. AdvanFort is a corporate sponsor of Piracy Daily and sponsors \\"white papers\\" on anti-piracy issues. AdvanFort specializes in maritime security including training, intelligence operations, and information security, and has a focus on providing armed security personnel and fleet assets in high-risk environments. Its fleet of Offshore Supported Vessels (OSVs) allows the company to operate outside a sovereign nation's borders. Most PMSCs must go through the port security of the countries their clients embark from before escorting their clients on their trade route. AdvanFort has six OSVs: , MV Seaman Guard Virginia, MV Seaman Guard Oklahoma, MV Seaman Guard Alaska, MV Seaman Guard Texas, and MV Seaman Guard Arizona. These vessels operate in the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean, and off the Eastern and Western coasts of Africa. In February 2013, the Panama Maritime Authority approved AdvanFort‚Äôs counter-piracy operations for the world's largest ship registry. Previously almost entirely staffed by veterans of the US military, the company has attracted naval personnel from other countries, in particular Estonia, some of whom said in 2011 that they were not paid or were insufficiently armed. Also in 2011, the company pleaded guilty in a US district court to \\"Aiding and Abetting the Making of a False Statement During the Acquisition of Firearms\\" in connection with a purchase from a supplier who did not secure the correct export license, for which it paid a fine and began serving two years' probation in spring 2013. AdvanFort is owned by US-based Arab billionaire Samir Farajallah, who was also previously its president. William H. Watson became president and COO of the company in August 2012. the company's advisory board included Charles Dragonette, a retired Senior Commercial Maritime Operations Analyst at the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence, Rear Admiral Joel Whitehead (USCG-Ret), John A.C. Cartner, a master mariner and maritime and admiralty attorney, and Michael Crye, an attorney and retired Coast Guard Captain. In January 2014 it was announced that Watson and Cartner had both left the company, amid rumors that it was financially shaky; vice chairman Ahmed Farajallah was appointed acting president and the company is being restructured.  2013 Seaman Guard Ohio incident  Gulf of Mannar On October 12, 2013, the MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained in international Waters by ICGS Naiki Devi and escorted to VOC Chidambaranar Port in Thoothukudi (Tuticorin). The ship had been close to a protected maritime conservation zone, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, a Biosphere Reserve, but wasn't inside. The ship was apparently spotted via satellite while refuelling. Even though an advanced satellite supposedly spotted the vessel the nearest radar station had been out of operation for 6 months. Defense personnel claimed that the interception occurred as the Seaman Guard Ohio was anchored barely 3.8 nautical miles from the baseline from which Indian territorial waters commence. This corresponds to 10.75 nautical miles off Vilangushuli Island. In fact the base line drawn on the out of date sea chart by the authorities was drawn by an incompetent witness, a radio operator in fact in pencil. While in port, the crew were denied access to welfare facilities offered by The Mission to Seafarers. Also they were denied consular access and a lawyer. AdvanFort stated that the ship did not have permission to sail into the Indian waters, but that it had done so partly to avoid the effects of Cyclone Phailin and had been invited to do so by the Coast Guard, for which the company president thanked the Indian government. AdvanFort called the arrests of crew members \\"inappropriate\\" and said that the company would explore diplomatic and legal avenues to obtain their release. Advanfort was subsequently accused of not supporting its contractors, leaving them to pay for their own defence, bail, food and housing. Indian maritime authorities claimed that the master of the vessel had not obtained clearances to enter Indian waters, and that the refueling, \\"suspected to be subsidised diesel in this case, within the Customs Waters ... can amount to smuggling ... The question of escaping from Phailin does not arise as the cyclone had no impact in that area.\\" In the trial court the fuel case was dropped as there was countless false witnesses and the diesel was actually obtained legally. According to the lying Coast Guard Commandant Anand Kumar, the ship's master did not explain why the ship was patrolling in the Bay of Bengal when its permit was limited to the Indian Ocean, and why the permits were given to the Q branch but not produced before the court for the weapons and ammunition the ship was carrying. Indian authorities impounded the ship as well as 35 weapons after being in port for 7 days, including semi-automatic rifles along with around 5,700 rounds of ammunition, until paperwork demonstrating permission to enter Indian waters could be shown. The 10 crew and 25 guards aboard--14 Estonians, 12 Indians, 6 Britons and 3 UkrainianIt was later reported that the captain, chief engineer, and one security guard were Ukrainian: --were not interrogated by a federal multi-agency joint investigation team made up of members of the Indian Coast Guard, Indian Navy, Customs, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the Q Branch of Intelligence Bureau. Between October 18 and 19 they were disembarked and remanded to judicial custody until 31 October; they were interned at Palayamkottai Central Prison in Tirunelveli. On October 23, 22 of the 23 foreign citizens were transferred to Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai. On October 25, the Q Branch of Indian Police were given custody of a British national and two Indian nationals for five days. On October 30 they and the Indians who had sold them fuel were denied bail. Tamil Nadu Police Coastal Security Group filed a FIR against the crew and guards of the ship on October 13, for unauthorised entrance into Indian waters in the Bay of Bengal with arms and ammunition and also for improper purchase of subsidized marine fuel. Indian investigators have involved US embassy officials in the probe. In late December 2013 an Indian court made a provisional ruling ordering all crew members of the Seaman Guard Ohio released on bail, but bail was subsequently revoked and the crew ordered to be held in custody until completion of the investigation. On 14 February 2014, the Thoothukudi court gave individual copies of the 2,158-page charge-sheet to all those accused in connection with the case and extended the judicial custody of those detained to 25 February 2014. On 18 February, the Madras High Court dismissed the petition for bail introduced by twelve Indian detainees. On 14 March 2014, the relatives of six former British soldiers included among those jailed delivered a 136,000-strong petition to Downing Street seeking the help of the British prime minister in securing bail for the men by making the UK government a guarantor for their bail conditions. On 26 March 2014, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court granted conditional bail to 33 of the 35 Advanfort employees held in India. Bail applications of ship captain Dudnik Valentyn and tactical deployment officer Paul David Dennish Towers were dismissed by the High Court as well as a lower court. On 22 May 2014, Judicial Magistrate Kathiravan turned down a petition by Advanfort to secure the release MV Seaman Guard Ohio. On 10 July 2014, Justice P N Prakash of the Madras high court dismissed criminal charges filed against the crew and armed-guards of the MV Seaman Guard Ohio under the Arms Act. The judge explained the reasons for the detention of the vessel as well as dismissal of criminal charges by saying : \\"I hold that the anchoring of MV Seaman Guard Ohio within our territorial sea was out of necessity and their action is saved by the principle of 'innocent passage' contemplated by Section 4(1) of the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zone Act, 1976 and Article 18 and 19 of UNCLOS. Therefore, the crew and the security guards cannot be prosecuted for an offence under the Arms Act.\\" Justice P N Prakash reaffirmed that both the Captain of the MV Seaman Guard Ohio and the supplier of 10 drums of diesel fuel are punishable under the Essential Commodities and Control Act for the improper purchase of subsidized marine fuel. Tamil Nadu CID ‚ÄòQ‚Äô Branch police lodged an appeal with the Indian Supreme Court against the ruling handed out at the Chennai (Madras) High Court. On 1 July 2015, the Indian Supreme Court heard an appeal filed by the CID ‚ÄòQ‚Äô Branch police against the 2014 judgement by the Madras High Court. Supreme Court Bench of Justices Vikramjit Sen and Abhay Manohar Sapre set aside the High Court‚Äôs decision as ‚Äúillegal and erroneous.‚Äù explaining that ‚ÄúThe very fact that huge quantity of arms and ammunition were recovered from the possession of the crew members from the vessel and they were unable to satisfy their legal possession over such arms/ammunition is sufficient to attract the provisions of Arms Act,‚Äù. The Supreme Court ordered the Tuticorin District Principal Sessions Court to complete the trial of the case and give its judgment within six months. The crew of MV Seaman Guard Ohio, already freed from police custody but forced to remain in India illegally, can only obtain their \\"No Objection Certificate\\" (NOC) from the Q branch. The agency that pressed the charges in the first place. The case has potentially important legal ramifications for India's interpretation of its maritime sovereignty. On 11 January 2016, judge of Tuticorin District Principal Sessions Court sentenced all the 10 crew and 25 guards to undergo 5 years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 3000 each. On Monday, 27 November 2017 the Chennai Appeal Court announced that the accused have been acquitted as the prosecution failed to prove they were in Indian waters and the ship held all necessary licences for the rifles on board. All foreign members have left India.

History FlyExpress was developed by the Center of Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University and was released in 2011 with funding and support from an NIH grant. Features The primary images available in FlyExpress are GEMs, or Genome-wide Expression Maps, that display the spatial patterns of genes during a state of fly development via heat maps. These not only give a visual clue as to where these genes are expressed, but also how many of them are expressed in the same vicinity, as the darker regions of the heat map correlate to a higher expressed gene count. Upon searching for images (with a gene name, PubMed ID, image ID or certain keywords), a series of GEMs are displayed from the two databases of the gene‚Äôs inclusion in descending stages and views of the embryo. Various details, such as the source and experimental protocol of the embryo, are also shown. All expression patterns reflect the wild-type allele for the gene. Categorizing genes as images does not only allow for visualization in understanding the influence of the gene, but also contrasting the patterns between multiple different genes. FlyExpress has a primary function of searching between images for similar expression patterns using a specified spatial profile via the Basic Expression Search Tool for Images (or BESTi), bringing up all images and genes that fit the criteria of the pattern. Certain classifications and locations of expression of genes can also be searched within the BDGP and Fly-FISH databases to gain similar results without specifying a particular gene to begin with. Searching between GEMs tends to give better results than searching genes through text criteria, which may not always contain all-encompassing text annotations and labeling and thus list a fewer number of overlapping genes upon searches.

Background  For many years, there was no law against keeping brown bears in Kosovo. All privately kept brown bears lived in small cages at restaurants. They were born mostly in the forests of Kosovo or Albania and snatched from their mothers by animal dealers. As restaurant bears they were supposed to attract customers, and thus profit, for their owners. In November 2010, when it became illegal to keep bears privately, there was a need for a national park as a new home for the restaurant bears rescued from captivity.http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/captive-brown-bears-gain- fresh-start  The Park  = Foundation= The Bear Sanctuary Prishtina was founded in 2013 by Four Paws Austria in collaboration with KFOR, the City of Prishtina, the Kosovar Ministry of Environment and the law firm Franke & Partner. The sanctuary provides species-appropriate accommodation for all restaurant bears in large enclosures resembling the bears‚Äô natural habitat Among the patrons of the park are in particular the Kosovar Minister of Environment Dr. Dardan Gashi, the Austrian ambassador in Kosovo Dr. Johann Brieger and Roswitha Brieger. = The bears = The Bear Sanctuary Prishtina has currently in care 20 brown bears (as of January 2020). These ‚Äòrestaurant bears‚Äô had been tracked down and registered by the government of Kosovo during the last few years and have been rescued in 2013. Two restaurant bears, named Rambo and Luta, could not be saved, because their proprietors killed the bears only hours before the rescue team arrived.Emergency Bear Rescue by Four Paws = Facilities = The sanctuary is built on an area of sixteen hectares.

It debuted on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 program on August 19, 2013, and was released digitally the following day as the album's third and final single. Recording The song was recorded during the recording sessions for a Nine Inch Nails greatest hits album, along with another song called \\"Satellite\\". These sessions gave way to more songs and ended up yielding an entire album. Reznor went on to state in another interview with The News & Observer, \\"There were a few moments of this album where I expected eyebrows to raise, but that actually was not one of them. To me, 'Everything' is a descendant of Fear and Joy Division and New Order. Somehow, that song has become representative of this as my 'happy album', although I don't hear it as such. It's certainly not meant to make you feel like, 'Look at how great everything is!' But it seems to be the shocking moment of the record. We've not played it onstage, only in rehearsals. It's become an irritant to me.\\" Critical reception The song was noted for being a departure from the band's musical style. Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline described the song as \\"an unexpectedly bright pop-beat jam\\" and \\"a surprising sound from the notoriously dark & melancholy outfit\\". Andrew Trendell of Gigwise also reported that \\"whereas recent singles 'Came Back Haunted' and 'Copy of A' were [Reznor's] trademark pumelling industrial metal, 'Everything' rolls with an infectious pop-punk bounce in the verse before a typically ugly but nonetheless addictive chorus\\". He also described the song as \\"probably the poppiest moment that we have ever heard from Trent Reznor\\". Claire Lobenfeld of Stereogum gave the song a positive review, commenting that the song is \\"the most pop we've ever heard from the band\\" and comparing it to other 1990s alternative rock acts such as Lit and Foo Fighters. Consequence of Sound described the song as \\"a sweeping rock anthem\\". Chris Martins of Spin magazine compared it to the band's hit 1994 song \\"Closer\\", while referring to it as \\"a surprisingly poppy, powered by major chord riffage and an upbeat backing track\\". He also stated that the track \\"swerves in and out of fiery punk passages that offset the catchier songwriting quite nicely\\" and that it \\"finds NIN veering into non-traditional territory\\". Fact magazine wrote that the song is \\"a relentlessly upbeat affair replete with harmonies on the chorus and an unusually propulsive beat, but seeing as Trent Reznor's involved it's hardly all sunshine and rainbows\\". Alex Hudson of Exclaim! described the song as uncharacteristically buoyant, while noting the pop influences and the vocal harmonies in the second verse. Nevertheless, he also noted plenty of noisy and dissonant elements typical of the band.

It was established on 25 May 2009 to protect a site containing rare plants and covers just over . It is located in the municipalities of Bavay and Saint-Waast in the Nord department. The reserve was created to protect fifteen plants of regional interest and three plant communities listed in the Habitats Directive. Its flora are linked to calcium present in marl. It is located in a transition zone between the oceanic and semi-continental climates and that gives increased biodiversity, with typical species of the atlantic areas and others more continental. The reserve also plays a role in a wildlife corridor. The site consists of an old quarry of sandstone dated to the Famennian stage in the Late Devonian epoch. It was backfilled in the 1970s with marl. The new soil was re-colonized by pioneer species, which coexist alongside an established afforestation, forming a mosaic of habitats. CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois, a non-governmental organization, is the owner and operator of the reserve. The main objective is to maintain the current diversity. To this end, regular management mainly struggles against the afforestation and against invasive species, such as Japanese knot weed. The secondary objectives are environmental education, heritage interpretation, improvement of knowledge fauna and flora, and environmental monitoring. Geography =Location= Position of the site (in red) to the west of downtown Bavay The Carri√®re des Nerviens Regional Nature Reserve is located in the Arrondissement of Avesnes-sur-Helpe between the cities of Valenciennes and Maubeuge, in the Nord department, Nord-Pas-de- Calais region. It is west of downtown Bavay and south-east of Saint-Waast. The reserve is triangular in shape. It is bordered to the south by the 942 main road, north-east by an unused railtrack, and to the west by a small path known as '. It covers .The Carri√®re des Nerviens's site is . But only the property of the CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois is classified of the regional nature reserve; the parcels belonging to other owners were not classified. CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois owns a parcel of land on the other side of the railtrack. Though not yet included in the reserve, it is expected to be added when the current agreement is renewed. =Relief= The reserve is located in the valley of the stream ', with an elevation of between . It has an overall north-south gradient of . A mound of accumulated debris, which rises to about above the path ', is located north-west of the site. After quarrying operations ceased, the quarry was filled mainly with the marl of the Bellignies quarry. The area has since been completely recolonized by vegetation through ecological succession. =Hydrology= The reserve is located in the valley of the ', a tributary of the Hogneau, and is part of the greater drainage basin of the Scheldt. The reserve is not in direct contact with the river. It is supplied with water only by precipitation, which is retained by the natural properties of marl. =Climate= The reserve's nearest weather station is at Cambrai, about 42 kilometres away, inland, to the southeast. However, the nature reserve is affected by the nearby presence of the Ardennes Mountains, which gives a continental influence to the climate. The regular precipitation and the absence of drought, as well as the predominance of south-southwest winds and rain vectors, show the influence of oceanic climate. However, some significant rainfall variability between seasons, the moderate temperature range, and the high proportion (69.8 percent) of low winds (less than ) compared to strong winds (3.2 percent over ) winds are typical of a continental influence. This combination is atypical of an altered oceanic climate, a transition zone between the oceanic and semi-continental climates, characterized by mild winters and cool summers. In the reserve, this climatic transition leads to increased biodiversity. For example, common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) is a typical species of the Atlantic areas, while the common butterbur (Petasites hybridus) is more continental. History Postcard of the site c. 1900 =Quarry= The site is a former quarry, used for its sandstone deposits as early as the late nineteenth century. by the Chevallier & Cie company, which employed about 70 workers, including 25 miners. In 1909, the annual production was of macadam, of ballast and of cobblestones. Boreholes were drilled manually. Stone blocks were divided using a mass and a steel heavy hammer (up to ) called '. Stones obtained were then classified by eye into stone for cobble and rubble for macadam. The first were ': asperities were removed by ' to form regular cobblestones. They were then sorted by size. The rubble was crushed in a jaw crusher. Debris were mechanically separated according to their size. Each particle has a particular use. Macadam, made of stones between , was used for the construction and maintenance of roads. Ballast is a gravel used for concrete. Shot from was used for the surface of concrete or paths in parks and gardens. The fine dust, from , was used for concrete paver blocks, concrete pipes, etc. Quarrying ceased in the early 1960s (1962‚Äì1965), when the stones extracted were no longer of sufficient quality. Between 1971 and 1978, the quarry was gradually filled with marl from the Bellignies quarry. Since then, the site has been completely recolonized by vegetation through ecological succession, forming tree, shrub and herb layers. =Reserve= Physical boundaries of the reserve In 2001, the site was brought to the attention of the CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois, pointing out the biodiversity of the new plant life. The association performed the first inventories. In the meantime, she contacted the five owners to consider a land management proposal. The commune of Bavay, the Bellignies quarry (SECAB) and a third owner sold her the property in 2003. The CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois became the owner / operator of 85 percent of the site. The association implemented the first environmental resources management actions at the site and developed its first environmental management schemeIn France, an environmental management scheme is defined by the ' (article R332-43). A scientific council must validate it to obtain or maintain the accreditation. In 2009, the association obtained the agreement establishing the regional nature reserve at the site for a period of 20 years. The name of the reserve recalls the former industrial activity (Carri√®re: quarry) and the Gallo-Roman history of Bavay, the capital city of the ancient Nervii tribe. In 2015, another owner give the management of his parcel. Geology The Paleozoic folded outcrops of the Bavay-Saint-Waast area are the bedrock of the eastern flank of the M√©lantois' anticline, where the transgressive Cretaceous (Turonian and Cenomanian chalk) thins, and may eventually disappear by erosion. Strata of Hercynian basement, raised in the East by an important structural horst-type accident, then appear locally. In these Paleozoic strata, the Devonian presents as a sandstone base of the Lower Famennian, where the levels were quarriedThese quarried rocks are no longer visible on the site, as they were fully covered by embankments. =Formations= Quarried level The stone that was quarried is arkoseSome geologists also call those sandstones psammite of the Famennian stage. Approximately 360 million years ago, the thrust of forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed. Meanwhile, an ice age occurred in regions near the poles. Marine regression allowed sedimentation of detrital sand and clays which left large shoals of hard sandstone with ripple marks, alternating with levels more or less shaley according to their clay's content. At the base of the deposit, these sandstones are reddish brown, very micaceous and shaley, sometimes containing calcareous nodules, ferruginous concretions and vegetable wax; above, they are gray and quartziferous. This is the Aye formation, including spiriferida like Cyrtospirifer verneuili, Rhynchonellida as Rhynchonella pugnus and R. boloniensis, some Orthoceras, Orthis striatula or Atrypa reticularis Well- preserved feldspar and mica probably come from wind erosion under a semi-arid climate of mountains present in the Netherlands today and extending to D√ºsseldorf. Lower level Cyrtospirifer verneuili is an extinct brachiopod, fossilized in the reserve. Under the Famennian, the Frasnian consists, from top to bottom, of nodular gray shale, and mica rich in fossils such as Cyrtospirifer verneuili, Spirigera concentrica, Atrypa reticularis, Orthis striatula, Productus subaculeatus, and Acervularia pentagona. Below this are gray limestone-built beds, rich in corals such as Phacellophyllum caespitosum, Thamnopora boloniensis, alternating with black shale and nodular limestone containing Cyrtospirifer verneuilli and Phacellophyllum caespitosum. These beds issue from siltation of the biostromes present in the Frasnian epoch, 370 million years ago. Upper levels Those Famennian strata represent the top of the Paleozoic series pleated with north dipping. Above, the transgressive Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with unconformity. It includes from the bottom to the top a paleozoic boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix, coarse clayey and glauconitic sands, containing Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana, Praeactinocamax plenus and finally marl with Terebratulina gracilis. These strata belong to the Cenomanian- Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a transgressive phase. Fifty million years ago, during the Ypresian age, locally called Landenian, forms of marl of the Porquerie are found. It comes from the alteration of Cretaceous rocks and takes the form of a brown or greenish plastic clay without fossils. The flints normally present at the base of the deposit have not been reported by . This stratum is covered with silt composed of clay, sand and flints and Roman pottery pieces, of the late Neogene age. Its origin can be attributed to the alteration of the underlying rocks and wind erosion. =Nature of the embankments= Sarrasin de Bettrechies : a shelly limestone The stones used to backfill the quarry are those which underlie the Givetian limestone extracted in the Bellignies quarry. There is ', a coarse shelly limestone, deep gray, yellowish when it outcrops, detrital ferruginous dated to the Lower Cenomanian epoch, a hundred million years ago. There is clay and very glauconitic marl of the Upper Cenomanian stage, enriched by a pebble conglomerate pal√©ozo√Øc stones. These rocks contain Praeactinocamax plenus, Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana and radiated fossils: Janira quadricostata, Cyprina ligeriensis, Arca mailleana. There is also bluish marl of the Turonian. Ecology =Plant communities= Map of habitats in the reserve The site is characterized by a mosaic of 17 plant communities regrouped into three main types of ecological units: grassy open areas, shrubby areas and wooded areas. Of these, three are listed in the Habitats Directive. The calcareous rocky slopes with chasmophytic vegetation Cystopterido fragilis-Asplenietum scolopendrii are considered as exceptional, with a degree of uncertainty in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Hydrophilous tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus, at the limit of its range, is also exceptional. The herbaceous fringe with red campion (Silene dioica) et wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) (Sileno dioicae - Myosotidetum sylvaticae) is very rare in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The wood-fringe Lathyro sylvestris ‚Äì Astragaletum glycyphylli is also regionally interesting. =Flora= Vascular plants The reserve has 171 plant species, and 15 of them have heritage interest. Twelve of them were inventoried in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) are present in the small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis).The lizard orchid (Himantoglossum hircinum) has not been seen in the reserve since 2003. bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur (Petasites hybridus). Seven plants are protected by a regional scale: common spotted orchid, man orchid, bee orchid, zigzag clover, liquorice milkvetch, narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and wood forget-me-not. alt=The moss Stellar calcareous moss Mosses In 2012, 43 species of bryophytes were inventoried, including Stellar calcareous moss (Mnium stellare), taxon considered as endangered on the Nord-Pas-de- Calais red regional list of bryophytes. =Mushrooms= Among the 115 species recorded in 2004 on the site, 15 are included in the red list of the Nord-Pas- de-Calais region.The Regional Red List was established by R√©gis Courtecuisse in 1997 and published in Cryptogamie, Mycologie, 18, no 3, pp. 183‚Äì219 In the shrubs near the path where green waste was deposited by people from outside the organization grow yellow club fungus (Clavulinopsis helvola), gray shag (Coprinopsis cinerea), black earth tongues (Trichoglossum hirsutum),Trichoglossum hirsutum is vulnerable in the Regional Red List. This species likes moist and mossy grassy places. Arrhenia spathulata and Marasmius limosus. Those two last species are also in the Calamagrostide's glade of a pioneer wood of willow and birch, with moor club (Clavaria argillacea), Geoglossum cookeanum, lilac leg fibrecap (Inocybe griseolilacina), (Stropharia pseudocyanea), girdled knight (Tricholoma cingulatum) and burnt knight (Tricholoma ustale). Near orchid stations in the pioneer wood exist golden spindles (Clavulinopsis fusiformis), Hebeloma clavulipes,Hebeloma clavulipes was identified for the first time in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. It was therefore not included in the Red List of 1997. It is an extomycorhizic species of willows in the reserve. Hebeloma fusipes, Hebeloma pusillum, and also lilac leg fibrecap and burnt knight. Dog stinkhorn (Mutinus caninus) and Scytinostroma hemidichophyticum for their part, were observed in the shaded path north of the site on the edge of mature wood. =Fauna= Mammals Common mammals found here include the red fox, red squirrel, hare and rabbit, mole, wood mouse, bank vole and field vole. Two species of bats frequent the site regularly to hunt: the Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus). They cannot, however, establish their habitat due to the lack of roosting sites in the reserve's young trees. Birds Forty-two species of birds have been observed on the site, 25 of which are breeding there. Twenty-two species are protected nationally; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range. However, no species can be considered as heritage. The northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally. Reptiles and amphibians The common toad (Bufo bufo) and the common frog (Rana temporaria) are the only amphibians on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects. The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris. Invertebrates Reproduction of Odonata is not possible on the site because of the lack of standing water. However, thanks to the richness of insects in the herbaceous areas, several species can be encountered including the western clubtail ( Gomphus pulchellus), a species present in the Regional Red List of dragonflies North Pas-de-Calais. Twenty- three species of butterflies and 105 species of moth enjoy the floral diversity of the site. The holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) is a heritage species. Of the nine species of Orthoptera identified, two are considered heritage: the sickle-bearing bush cricket (Phaneroptera falcata), rare in the region, enjoys the dry and high herbaceous areas and the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis) is a pioneer species of poor vegetation settings. Integration of the reserve in the wildlife corridor. =The wildlife corridor= To the north are present two sites containing a rich biodiversity: the Natura 2000 Belgian area \\"'\\" and a ZNIEFFZNIEFF is an acronym for ', natural area of ecological, faunal and floral interest. The designation of a ZNIEFF is essentially based on the presence of species or groups of species with high heritage value \\"'\\". The Bellignies quarry with embankments similar to those which filled \\"'\\" is therefore under similar ecological conditions. In the south, the For√™t de Mormal is a major area for biodiversity covered by ZNIEFF and Natura 2000 sites. The railway, unused recently and the stream ' then the river ' provide connection. =Threats and responses= In the past, the site was threatened by garbage dumps or by passage of 4x4 vehicles or quads. The installation of gates by the municipality of Bavay solved the problem. Pedestrians rarely venture off the path. The anthropization is limited. The greatest threats to the species are primary succession and invasive plants. Primary succession The marls was colonized by pioneer species, then shrubs and trees, corresponding to a primary succession. Without human intervention, a climax community would be reached. This dynamic may eventually lead to the disappearance of related open environments, particularly heritage species. However woodlands can also play an important role in creating habitat for many species. The management plan is therefore to maintain patch dynamics. Panoramic view of the reserve Invasive species Four invasive species are a problem in the reserve. Wood small- reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) is present in the center of the site and threatens to spread into herbaceous areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state. Many extensive areas of Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) are on the site. Heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern, colonized by invasive species, are managed by manual removal and disposal for incineration. The bramble (Rubus sp.) lie around the ruins and along the south-east of the site near the houses. Due to an interest in preserving wildlife (e.g. refuge for mammals, insects, nesting wrens), they are not eradicated but contained. Canada golden-rod (Solidago canadensis) appeared in 2003 as a result of plant deposits. The threat proved to be serious the following year. Some stations show a significant concentration of the species, while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site. This plant is easily pulled by hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal, and the shoots are burned. Finally, panicled aster (Symphyotrichum lanceolatum) is also present among the invasive plants. In their native countries, American asters are found in wet places. In France, these plants colonize relatively dry ruderal areas (brownfields, road shoulder ...) or wetlands. In this second case, asters show strong invasive behavior. In the reserve, where the majority of areas are dry, this plant does not present special hazards and removal is managed easily. Management =Protection= Parcels of land owned by the CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois were classified as a regional nature reserve on by decision of the '. The entire site is included in a ZNIEFF type 1ZNIEFF type 1, of small size, are environmentally homogeneous spaces and have at least one species and / or rare or threatened habitat of local and regional, national or community interest, or they are spaces of great interest in the functioning of the local ecology. ' and another of type 2ZNIEFF type 2 are very rich natural sets, or slightly modified, which provide important biological potential. They may include ZNIEFF type 1 and have a functional role and an ecological and landscape coherence. '. =Management objectives= Volunteers grubbing-up Japanese knotweed The second version of the environmental management scheme covers the period 2007‚Äì2012. It presents the knowledge, management, monitoring and vulgarization objectives. The preservation of the existing diversity was the most important goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris ‚Äì Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats. The education, interpretation and promotion of local heritage missions should also be continued, while the fauna knowledge was to be developed and floristic monitoring provided. =Assessment of the activities= Evaluation is in progress. However, a partial analysis is already underway. Activities carried out The Bavay's municipality has erected two barriers to prohibit access to motorized vehicles. Volunteers and employees of the CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois manage the site regularly. Management of the diversity Manual removal of the Japanese knotweed has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population. Evolution of the size of population of man orchid. Protective device of man orchid seedlings. From 2007 to 2012, the number of round-leaved wintergreen footage increased by 50 percent. On the other hand, those of man orchid fall suddenly and continually. Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003, the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the uprooting of the wood small- reed, before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012, despite the continued management. The observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores. Protection against rodents was established in 2013 and will be evaluated at flowering. On this site, 171 plant species are surveyed. Given its size and poor soil, this diversity is notable. Management undertaken in recent years has been essential to maintaining open areas, the most threatened by primary succession. Thus, the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, bushy areas, open areas) provide a mosaic of habitats, and thus remarkable species. Improved knowledge of flora and fauna Besides heritage plants monitoring, an additional inventory of Orthoptera is being undertaken; three new species were identified in 2013: common pheasant, Eurasian siskin and common wall lizard. Fourteen new plants were also identified. Inventories of bats and mushrooms are being carried out by partners. Education, interpretation and promotion of local heritage Guided outing in the site. Guided outing and participatory management sessions are regularly held with the public or agricultural colleges, including invasive species managing. The heritage interpretation site has yet to be finalized. =New opportunities= Interreg micro projects, established in February 2012, resulted in methodological exchanges on the management of reserves between two Belgian associations ' and Natagora. A new environmental management scheme is now under consideration.

It is the parent of seven community banks‚ÄîHomeTrust Bank, Tryon Federal Bank, Shelby Savings Bank, Home Savings Bank, Industrial Federal Bank, Cherryville Federal Bank and Rutherford County Bank. History HomeTrust Bank was founded in 1926 as Clyde Building and Loan in Clyde, North Carolina. Later, the name changed to Clyde Savings and Loan Association and then Clyde Savings Bank. Ed Broadwell joined the bank in 1965 at age 27, the youngest bank president in the state. The bank had $10 million in assets and five people worked there. In 1973, the bank bought a block in Asheville and built a new three-story headquarters. Dana Stonestreet, who took over after Broadwell's retirement, said, \\"They hired more people to open that office than they had in the whole history of the bank.\\" Clyde Savings Bank expanded into Buncombe County and Henderson County. In 2003, the name changed to HomeTrust Bank. By 2010 HomeTrust had two locations in Haywood County, five in Buncombe County and one in Henderson County in North Carolina. In 2013, Broadwell retired after 48 years. Tryon Federal Bank, started in 1935, had two offices in Polk County, and Shelby Savings Bank, started in 1905, had two offices in Cleveland County. Rutherford County Bank opened its first office in Forest City in May 2007, at which time it also became part of HomeTrust Banking Partnership. Home Savings Bank of Rockingham County began June 9, 1909. As of its 10th anniversary in 2009, it had two offices in Eden and one in Reidsville. Industrial Federal Bank started in 1929. On January 31, 2010, Industrial Federal Bank, with three locations in Davidson County, became part of the HomeTrust Banking Partnership. This gave the partnership 19 offices, and with $1.6 billion in assets, the partnership was the largest mutual bank in the state and the second-largest in the southeastern United States. Cherryville Federal Savings and Loan in Cherryville joined the partnership later in 2010, adding one location. As of January 2012, when HomeTrust Bank and its partners announced conversion from mutual to stock.

Best known as the vocalist, guitarist and songwriter for Warm Soda, he also previously fronted Bare Wires and Snake Flower 2. Melton currently fronts Dream Machine with his wife Doris and has also released solo material. In 2012, Melton set up independent record label and recording studio Fuzz City where he is noted to have recorded and produced the majority of his music. Early life Matthew Melton stages own arrest at Memphis College of Art BFA exhibition, 2005 Melton was born in Memphis, Tennessee. His family is from the English town of Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, who settled in West Memphis, Arkansas in the 1900s. At an early age he was trained as an opera singer and performed in various operas including Carmen and Tosca. He also performed in a children's back up choir for John Denver. He attended Memphis College of Art, where for his senior thesis he presented a series of photographs of every high school cafeteria in Memphis, entitled Cafeterium. Melton staged his own arrest at the gallery showing of his senior thesis under the pretence that \\"the photographs were taken illegitimately\\". To obtain his diploma, he was forced to write a letter of apology for the incident. Around this time, Melton briefly played bass in the River City Tanlines with Lost Sounds frontwoman Alicja Trout and performed with own band, the Memphis Break-Ups, while booking shows for Memphis venue XY&Z.; In 2006, he photographed Jay Reatard for the cover of his first solo album, Blood Visions. Snake Flower 2/Bare Wires (2007‚Äì2012) In 2007, Melton left Memphis for California and eventually settled in San Francisco. He formed Snake Flower 2, and released a handful of singles before releasing debut album Renegade Daydream in 2008. The band featured a revolving lineup, with the album recording featuring drummer Will Axe and bassist Donelle Malnik. Melton described the album as being \\"the first batch of songs I wrote after I escaped from the South\\". Bare Wires performing live, 2010 After relocating to Oakland, Melton reformed Bare Wires which originated in his home state and initially featured bassist Paul Keelan and drummer Erin Emslie, who was replaced by Heather Fedewa. The band's first album Artificial Clouds was released in 2009. The album was self-produced by Melton, and recorded on a Tascam 388 analog multitrack which he purchased after using one on the Snake Flower 2 album. It was also mastered by the late Jay Reatard in exchange for writing, recording, and producing the Hunx and His Punx single Teardrops on my Telephone to be released on his label, Shattered Records.Henry, John (August 18, 2009). \\"Bare Wires: The Most Worthless Piece of Video\\". LA Record. Melton described the band's sound as \\"smooth punk.\\"Child, Tom (June 9, 2011). \\"Bare Wires: No Real Test for LSD\\". LA Record. By the second album the band featured drummer Nathan Price and bassist Fletcher Johnson. They went on to release a further 3 albums, Seeking Love in 2010, Cheap Perfume in 2011 and Idle Dreams in 2012 and went through several line-up changes. The band toured relentlessly, with Melton admitting that \\"basically all I want is to play with people who enjoy touring, which means that you can't have a job and you can't have a girlfriend\\". The band imploded in 2012, after drummer Omar Hernandez was hospitalised following an overdose (which Melton originally referred to as being a \\"self-induced health-related concern\\") and the band were forced to use a replacement drummer for their shows at that years SXSW festival in Austin, Texas The band struggled through their sets with Tony Leal of the band Part Time on drums who they were teaching the songs \\"on the fly\\" and immediately disbanded and cancelled the remainder of their tour following the festival. Melton reportedly travelled back to Oakland by himself, and announced that \\"Bare Wires is over - some things aren't made to go forever\\".  Warm Soda (2012‚Äì2017) On returning to Oakland, Melton formed Warm Soda. Melton employed another revolving lineup, with the band initially featuring drummer Sam Lefebvre and guitarist Rob Good with Melton on vocals and bass. The lineup recorded the band's debut single Reaction. The band released debut album Someone for You in March 2013 via John Dwyer's label Castleface Records. The album was recorded with Frank Ene on bass. By the time they toured the album, the lineup featured bassist Chase Oren Asmussen and drummer Ian McBrayer along with Melton and Good. The album was recorded and produced by Melton and Good at their home studio Fuzz City. In 2014, the band released their second album Young Reckless Hearts and featured Chase Oren Asmussen on bass Melton commented on the album, that \\"I sort of over produced it, over thought it. Honestly I can't stand how this album came out. I was so frustrated with problems between band members that I mixed certain songs badly on purpose\\". Following the release of the album, Melton \\"kicked out Chase Oren, the bass player, and after dismissing him from the group it sort of came to a turning point for the band. It was also a turning point in my life\\". He disbanded the current lineup of the band and relocated to Austin, Texas where he got a job at the Hotel Vegas venue and then formed a new lineup featuring drummer Caleb Dawson, bassist Austin \\"Shock\\" Shockley and guitarist Max Eaton who played their first show together on July 5 at Hotel Vegas. Commenting further on the move, Melton stated that \\"a lot of the move had to do with my wife. On the last Warm Soda tour I met and fell in love with, at first sight, my wife Doris, in Rotterdam. We came back to Oakland, but with the rising housing costs and all things considered we couldn't do it\\". Doris, who was born in Bosnia but raised in the Netherlands, contributed keyboards to Warm Soda's subsequent albums. In 2014 Warm Soda performed live on Last Call with Carson Daly. The band released third album Symbolic Dream in April 2015, with Melton stating that the album \\"holds onto a lot of good elements that might have been present on the first album. I feel like I'm in a continual process of refining and further refining my sound in kind of a compressed bubblegum, glam glitter fuzz\\". The band toured Europe with guitarist Alex Capistran. Ousted bass player Chase Oren Asmussen died on June 11, 2016. In February 2017, the band's fourth and final studio album I Don't Wanna Grow Up was announced. Released in April 2017, Melton did not perform any Warm Soda shows to promote the album and it peaked at #25 on the Muzooka college radio chart.  Dream Machine (2017‚Äìpresent) Issued simultaneously with the last Warm Soda album, Melton released the debut album for new band Dream Machine in May 2017. The band features his Bosnian-born wife Doris Melton on organ and synthesizer, along with Rudy Spencer on bass and Dillon Fernandez on drums. Promoting the album, the couple revealed that they were moving from the US to live in the Netherlands, which was where Doris had lived before her marriage. Doris Melton commented that \\"American musicians (hopefully not Europe too) are getting increasingly politically correct and it started getting on our nerves. Living in Austin also was getting more and more expensive\\", with Matthew Melton adding that he was \\"so excited to be moving to Europe, but I will always consider myself a red-blooded American. And just like the waves of refugees pouring into Europe I will also not be learning any new languages or culturally assimilating. We're bringing Austin to Amsterdam\\" He and Doris railed against social media, illegal immigration, feminist bands and promiscuity. On 23 June 2017, Castle Face Records announced via their Facebook page that they had dropped the band due to these views that were expressed by Doris and Matthew Melton in their interview with the French website Still In Rock in May 2017, deeming them to be \\"some ugly opinions\\". The label alleged that they had been unaware of the contents of the interview despite linking to it themselves at the time, until it was brought to their attention over a month later. The band responded to the label's decision by stating that \\"we know in our hearts that we aren't racists or fascists and we fully denounce all forms of hatred and intolerance\\" and that \\"this will not hold us back and we will continue to make music and want to thank all the people that are standing up for us, we truly appreciate it\\". They also revealed that they were dropped immediately without being given any opportunity to explain or defend the interview and that the label refused to post the band's response despite the request in the label's press release. After departing Castle Face, Matthew's Fuzz City label took over distribution of the band. In the fall, Melton released his solo album Night Life, which was already planned for release at the time of the controversy. Dream Machine then released its second album, Breaking the Circle, in late 2017 (Matthew's fourth album released in 2017). Band membership now consisted of Matthew on guitars and bass, Doris on piano and synthesizer, and Oskar Mead on drums.

He was arrested by Indian authorities on 16 August at the India-Nepal border. However, the exact timings of this arrest is disputed with various versions being reported.The Controversy over Arrest of Abdul Karim Tunda. Later, he received a clean chit by a Delhi court in all four cases against him. Early life Born in a poor family in 1943 at Chatta Lal Miya area in central Delhi's Dariyaganj area, he started his career as a carpenter at his native village in Bazaar Khurd area in Pilkhuwa in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad district. He married for the first time here in Uttar Pradesh. He came to Behrampura, Ahmedabad in 1982 and started carpentry and scrap business. He looked after a mosque and taught holy books to children. He married for the second time, Mumtaz and had a son, Irshaan after a year of a marriage. He returned to Delhi in 1989. He married for the third time an 18-year-old girl, at the age of 65 in Pakistan. He has 6 children. Later life He came under the police radar after the Mumbai serial bombings in 1993. He got the moniker Tunda ‚Äì Hindi/ Bengali (Bangla) for without a hand or physically handicapped- after his left hand got severed in an accident while preparing a bomb in 1985 in Mumbai. His younger brother Abdul Malik, who still is a carpenter, is reportedly the only immediate family member alive in India. He also stayed in Pakistan where he is known to have imparted training on fabrication of IED and other explosives to mujahids who were sent to India from Pakistan for jihad. During his stay in Pakistan, he had been in touch with organisations like ISI, LeT, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Indian Mujahideen and Babbar Khalsa and had been meeting people like Hafiz Saeed, Maulana Masood Azhar, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Dawood Ibrahim and several others wanted by India. He was using an elaborate network of human traffickers and fake currency suppliers active in Bangladesh. Tunda has also been associated with Rohingya operatives in the past. His association with LeT commanders Rehan alias Zafar and Azam Cheema alias Babajee is well known. Role in terrorism After being indoctrinated by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in the 1980s, Tunda became a jihadi at the age of 40. After allegedly masterminding 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, in 1994, he fled to Bangladesh where he taught making bombs to jihadi elements and in 1998, he acted as 'mentor' to give training to younger generation of Lashkar operatives in terror camps in Pakistan. In 1994, Tunda's name surfaced in Chhattisgarh Express bomb blast near Ghaziabad railway station that claimed 19 lives. In 1994, it is said that Delhi Police and the intelligence bureau also raided Ashok Nagar area after receiving a tip-off from sources. But Tunda managed to escape before being nabbed. But, security agencies found explosives, detonators, Pak made weapons and objectionable documents written in Urdu from his hideout in huge quantity. In 1996, an Interpol Red Corner notice was issued against Tunda. In 1997, after returning to India, he was involved in a bomb blast that took place near Punjabi Bagh in west Delhi in a Blueline bus that killed at least four people and injured around 24 people. It is believed that he died in a blast in Bangladesh in 2000 but Abdul Razzaq, an LeT operative arrested by the Delhi police in 2005, revealed about his presence in Pakistan. Tunda's name was on number 15 in a dossier of \\"most wanted terrorists\\" that India handed over to Pakistan after 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. He is also believed to be guiding the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), which later turned into Indian Mujahideen. Besides that, he was planning to 'recruit' Rohingyas from Myanmar to target Buddhists there. He had also tried to carry out serial explosions in the national capital Delhi, just before the Commonwealth Games in 2010, but the plan was foiled as his accomplices were arrested. According to reports, it has emerged that Tunda aims at carrying out blasts at crowded places and inflict maximum casualties. A close aide of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and top LeT commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, an \\"expert bomb maker\\", Tunda is accused of masterminding over 40 cases of bomb blasts in Mumbai, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Hyderabad and Surat. 70-year-old Tunda is one of the prized catch by the Delhi police in the war against terror, who took shelter in various countries after fleeing India 20 years back. He also had a major hand in spreading Laskhar-e-Taiba's network outside Jammu and Kashmir. =Arrest= The Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested 70 years old Tunda on 16 August at around 3 pm in Uttarakhand's Banbasa area close to the Nepal border on the basis of an information received by central intelligence agencies, He was possessing a Pakistani passport issued on 23 January 2013.

It was developed by Tiltfactor Laboratory, a game research center located at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, focusing on games and play that investigate and explain ideas.  History of the game  Zombiepox is an evolution of Pox: Save the People, which was developed by Tiltfactor in coordination with the Mascoma Valley Health Initiative to stop the spread of misinformation concerning the effects of vaccination. Zombiepox is also designed to be educational and initial research showed that people's sentiments on vaccinations became more positive when faced with the fictitious disease in the game. Playing the game also appears to improve people's systems thinking abilities.  Gameplay  Designed as a board game for one to four players, the game centers on a town that has been infected with a disease called zombiepox. The objective is to stop the spread and help humans escape by vaccinating them. Players win the game if the disease can no longer spread and lose if too many people become full-blown zombies.  Awards and recognition  The game won a Major Fun Award for Cooperation Thinking in 2012. It was also selected for display at IndieCade's 2012 Indie Game Showcase.

Her racing career was restricted to six races between June and November 1983 and included three wins including the Prix Vermeille and Prix de Psych√©. She went on to finish sixth behind Dancing Brave in France's most important race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and was one of the highest-rated fillies of her generation in Europe. She was then retired to stud and became a highly successful producer of winners. Background Darara was a small, lightly built bay mare with a faint white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by his owner Aga Khan IV. Her sire Top Ville was an Irish-bred, French-trained horse which won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1979. At stud he also sired Toulon, winner of the St Leger Stakes, Pistolet Bleu (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud), Saint Estephe (Coronation Cup) and Shardari. Her dam Delsy also produced Darshaan, who won the 1984 Prix du Jockey Club and went on to become a leading sire. The filly was sent into training with Alain de Royer-Dupr√© at Chantilly and usually raced in a sheepskin noseband. Racing career Darara's small size and delicate constitution made her difficult to train and she did not appear on a racecourse until June 1986, when she won the Prix Albaraelle, a maiden race over 2000 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse. She then finished second in a Listed race at Evry Racecourse before being moved up in class to contest the Group Three Prix de Psych√© at Deauville in August. Ridden by Yves Saint- Martin, she won by one and a half lengths from the British-trained Cocotte. In September, Darara was moved up to Group One class for the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. The Prix de Diane winner Lacovia was made the odds-on favourite, with Darara third in the betting on 3.8/1. Saint-Martin sent the filly into the lead in the straight and she accelerated clear of her seven opponents to win easily by five lengths from Reloy. Following his filly's success, the Aga Khan opted to pay a 250,000 supplementary fee to enter the filly in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The Aga Khan's four-horse entry for the race on 5 October, comprising Darara, Shardari, Shahrastani and the pacemaker Dihistan, started at combined odds of 9/2 in an exceptionally strong field which included Dancing Brave, Bering, Acatenango and Triptych. Darara was among the leaders in the straight, but weakened in the closing stages to finish sixth of the fifteen runners, four lengths behind the winner Dancing Brave. On her final appearance, Darara was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park on 1 November. She was never is serious contention and finished eighth of the nine runners behind Manila. Assessment In 1986, the independent Timeform organisation awarded Darara a rating of 129, placing her alongside the one-mile specialist Sonic Lady as the best three-year-old filly in Europe. In the International Classification rated her the best three-year-old filly over 11 furlongs plus with a rating of 126. Stud record Darara was retired from racing to become a broodmare at her owners stud. In 1994 Darara was offered for sale and bought for 470,000 Irish guineas on behalf of Lord and Lady Lloyd Webber and was moved to the Watership Down Stud in Berkshire. Darara failed to produce a foal for several years after moving to Berkshire but recovered her fertility after a pioneering procedure involving the \\"flushing\\" of her fallopian tubes. She was a highly successful broodmare, producing four winners of Group One flat races and one Grade I winning steeplechaser. Her offspring included: *Dariyoun a bay colt, foaled in 1988, sired by Shahrastani, won four races including the Gran Premio de Madrid *Dardjini bay colt 1990, by Nijinsky won six races including the Denny Gold Medal Chase *Darazari, bay colt 1993 by Sadler's Wells won two races in Europe including the Prix Maurice de Nieuil before being exported to Australia where he won the Ranvet Stakes. *Kilimanjaro, bay colt 1995 by Shirley Heights won one race. *Rhagaas, bay colt 1996 by Sadler's Wells, won one race *River Dancer, bay colt 1999 by Sadler's Wells, won three races including the Prix La Force in France and the Queen Elizabeth II Cup in Hong Kong. *Dar Re Mi, bay filly 2005 by Singspiel, won six races including the Prix Minerve, Pretty Polly Stakes, Yorkshire Oaks, Sheema Classic *Rewilding, bay colt 2007 by Tiger Hill, won five races including the Cocked Hat Stakes, Great Voltigeur Stakes, Sheema Classic, Prince of Wales's Stakes Darara was retired from breeding after foaling Rewilding in 2007 and died in June 2012 at the age of twenty-nine.

Its sixteen floors include classrooms, research facilities, laboratories, offices and a cafeteria. Its design, by Canadian architect Janet Leys Shaw Mactavish of the architecture firm Marshall and Merrett, is meant to reduce traffic and circulation between rooms. Its position on the sloping side of Mount Royal, and the requirement for there to be two entrances at different levels (ground and 6th floors), made it a difficult architectural design site. Its modern circular shape and design, as well as its height amidst the older buildings of the McGill campus, contributed to Montreal's image at the time of the Expo 67 World's Fair. http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/adams/arch533/summer2012/mcintyre.html The McIntyre Building, as it is generally known, houses, among other services and departments, the Osler Library of the History of Medicine (named after one of McGill's most famous medical graduates and professors and an icon of modern medicine William Osler) the Departments of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Biochemistry, Physiology, and Anesthesia.

The test involves two different abilities: gross movements of arms, hands, and fingers, and fine motor extremity, also called \\"fingerprint\\" dexterity. Poor Pegboard performance is a sign of deficits in complex, visually guided, or coordinated movements that are likely mediated by circuits involving the basal ganglia. History Dr. Joseph Tiffin, an Industrial Psychologist at Purdue University, designed the test in 1948. It was originally intended for assessing the dexterity of assembly line workers. Method and interpretation The pegboard consists of a board with two parallel rows with 25 holes into which cylindrical metal pegs are placed by the examinee. The test involves a total of four trials. To begin, there is a brief practice. The subsets for preferred, non-preferred, and both hands require the patient to place the pins in the holes as quickly as possible, with the score being the number of pins placed in 30 seconds. =Neurocognitive disorders= The Purdue Pegboard test predicted worse adult tic severity and correlated with tic severity at the time of childhood assessment. Purdue Pegboard performance deficiencies have been linked to poor social functioning in schizophrenia. =Industry= Results from a correlation analysis suggested that a person's capability on the Purdue Pegboard Test is a good predictor of their ability to use a mobile phone in cold weather. Reliability One-trial administration of the Purdue Pegboard Test produced test-retest reliability of 0.60 to 0.79. The three-trial administration test- retest reliability ranged from 0.82 to 0.91.

Depending on the mobile device platform, the URI required to trigger the app may be different.  Deep linking and mobile operating systems  Unlike the Web, where the underlying technology of HTTP and URLs allow for deep linking by default, enabling deep linking on mobile apps requires these apps be configured to properly handle a uniform resource identifier (URI). Just like a URL is an address for a website, a URI is the address for an app on a mobile device. Examples of URIs that launch a mobile app: * \`twitter://\` is the iOS URI to launch Twitter‚Äôs mobile app * \`YouTube://\` is the iOS URI to launch YouTube‚Äôs mobile app The format of the URI used to trigger or deep link an app is often different depending on the mobile operating system. Android devices work through intents, BlackBerry 10 devices work through BB10's invocation framework, Firefox OS devices work through Web Activities, iOS devices work through the openUrl application method, and Windows Phone 8 devices work through the UriMapper class. * \`fb://profile/33138223345\` is an example of a mobile deep link URI. The URI contains all the information needed to launch directly into a particular location within an app, in this case the profile with id '\`33138223345\`', i.e., the Wikipedia page, within the Facebook app, instead of simply the info for launching the Facebook app \`fb://\`. * eBay's apps demonstrate the use of different schemes by platform. \`eBay://launch?itm=360703170135\` is the URI of a deep link into eBay‚Äôs iOS app while \`eBay://item/view?id=360703170135\` is the URI of a deep link into eBay‚Äôs Android app. Wikipedia doesn‚Äôt allow such links so there are none in this article. Just the raw, uninterpreted wiki source code is displayed if it's attempted, for example [twitter://jack link with twitter://jack as its target].  Complexity of mobile deep linking and the need for a streamlined solution  The greatest benefit of mobile deep linking is the ability for marketers and app developers to bring users directly into the specific location within their app with a dedicated link. Just as deep links made the web more usable, mobile deep links do the same for mobile apps. Unlike deep links on the web, where the link format is standardized based on HTTP guidelines, mobile deep links do not follow a consistent format. This causes confusion in development because different sets of links are required to access the same app on a different mobile operating system.  Passing search data via deep linking  Google allows app developers who have both iOS and Android apps to surface in-app content via mobile Google searches. Developers will need to submit their app and deep linking apps on both iOS and Android to be indexed by Google. Alternatively, developers can use Google's short links to deep link mobile app users if the app is installed and direct others to the webpage. One example of a better user experience made possible because of deep link and data passing through install solution is one in which search information is passed into an app to bring the user to the exact information that drove them to the app. Compared to a common web link, this implementation may reduce the number of steps required. For example, to search for hotels in Boston, a user currently needs to: # Perform a Google search for a term # See that a company has relevant content in its app # Manually switch from the browser to the app (download the app first if required) # Perform the search again in the app That can be shortened to: # Search on Google # Select the in- app search result to view in-app (if app is installed)  References  External links * Appindex deep linking guide Category:URL ","title":"Mobile deep linking"},{"id":"40289817","text":"Siyahvarud (, also Romanized as Sƒ´yƒÅhvar≈´d and SeyƒÅhvaR≈´d; also known as Sƒ´yƒÅhvar≈´d (Persian: ÿ≥ŸäÿßŸáŸàÿ±ŸàÿØ), SiyƒÅhVar≈´d, Sƒ´yahVar≈´d, Sƒ´ƒÅyhVar≈´d, Sƒ´ƒÅvehvaR≈´d, Sƒ´yƒÅhVar≈´d, and Siyahvarud, is a village in Darram Rural District, in the Central District of Tarom County, Zanjan Province, Iran.

It consists of a dentary, cervical and sacral vertebrae, one ungual, and remains of the pelvic region. The mandible has an 'L' shaped morphology, with the symphyseal region of the dentary slightly twisted medially, a feature never recorded before in any titanosaur. Phylogeny Although the phylogenetic position of Brasilotitan is difficult to establish, the new species is neither basal nor a derived member of Titanosauria. Based on lower jaw morphology, it appears to be closely related to Antarctosaurus and Bonitasaura.

He was an important participant in a tumultuous period of Scottish history. Early Years Born in 1531, Montgomerie was the great-grandson of Hugh Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Eglinton. He attended St. Mary's College, St. Andrews in 1552. Soon after, Montgomerie married Janet Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, then First Earl of Aran. Although Montgomerie was a Catholic, he originally supported his Protestant father-in-law politically. In October 1559, Montgomery brought forces to Edinburgh to support Hamilton and the Scottish Lords of the Congregation against French forces supporting the exiled Mary Stuart and the current Scottish government. In December 1559, Montgomerie renewed his pledge of support. Support of Mary However, as a practicing Catholic, Montgomerie was a frequent target of criticism by Protestant clerics, and was said to attend daily mass and had a priest on his personal staff. He soon switched sides to support Mary Stuart. In December 1560, soon after the death of Mary's teenage husband, Francis II of France, Montgomerie signed a pledge of support for her in a meeting at Dunbar Castle. In February 1561, he traveled to France to visit Mary. Hamiliton returned with her to Scotland in August 1561, when she assumed the Scottish throne. On 15 May 1568 Montgomerie joined Mary's forces at the Battle of Langside. After their defeat, he fled the field and spend the night hiding in an outhouse. On 19 August Parliament declared Montgomerie guilty of treason for failing to turn over his castles to the victor. In May 1571 he finally swore allegiance to the Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, the regent for the young king James VI. In September 1571, Montgomerie was with Stewart when he was killed at a skirmish in Stirling. The raiding party, which included the Hamiltons, locked Montgomerie in his quarters under guard. In 1573, Montgomerie advocated tolerance for Catholics in 1573 from the latest regent, Morton. In 1578. Morton used his influence to appoint Montgomerie as a Privy Councillor. In 1579, Montgomerie subscribed the order for prosecuting the Hamiltons for their roles in the murders of Mathew Stewart and another regent, James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray. When Morton fell out of power, Montgomerie served as an assize for Morton's trial in 1581. Marriage and issue Montgomerie's first wife was Lady Jean Hamilton. The Montgomeries had the marriage dissolved in 1562 and the couple had no children. That same year, Montgomerie married Agnes Drummond daughter of Sir John Drummond of Innerpeffray and Monzie Castle, (a granddaughter of James IV of Scotland).

When he went to the acting program at York University, he met other struggling Asian immigrants and became inspired to adopt a short form of his birth name, ‚ÄúIns Choi‚Äù.‚ÄúIns Choi / Canadian Life Changer Pt. 1‚Äù, YouTube, YouTube, uploaded by ‚Äú100 Huntley‚Äù May 10, 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj1CY5uFaF0. Throughout his childhood, Choi played volleyball, football, rugby, hockey, was cast in a school production called ‚ÄúDamn Yankees‚Äù (at Victoria Park S.S.), and performed in ‚ÄúBanana Boys‚Äù. After school he worked at his parents‚Äô friends convenience store. Choi attended North Toronto Collegiate Institute in the early 1990s. Choi graduated from York University's theatre program in 1998 Choi was rejected the first time he applied to the fine arts program at York. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt talented enough,‚Äù Choi says. He completed a Master of Theological Studies instead at Wycliffe College, University of Toronto. In that time he was forced to read more and do more reading analysis; Choi asserts that this scholarly activity made him a better writer and were a contributing factor to his success. His professors at Wycliffe, such as John Bowen, Brian Walsh, and Marion Taylor were a great influence, and encouraged him to be an artist. Choi worked with fu-GEN, a Toronto based Asian Canadian theater company, who helped him figure out what he wanted to portray to an audience through his work. Choi emphasizes the importance of community as the goal for his shows to play in cities worldwide, predominantly in Korean communities, to honor Koreans who made sacrifices for other migrating Koreans. Working with fu-GEN showed him ‚Äúwho [he] really was and what [he] really wanted to say mattered in the world of art,‚Äù according to Choi, and inspired him to write Kim‚Äôs Convenience.  Personal life  According to Choi, his mother is strict. However, she gets things done, which is where he maintains dual attributes of being artistic, focused, and determined. His father used to be a pastor of an immigrant church in downtown Toronto that he personally owned and founded.Leadlay, Christina. ‚Äú15 Things You Didn't Know about Playwright Ins Choi.‚Äù The Hill Times, The Hill Times, 10 Feb. 2017, https://www.hilltimes.com/2017/02/08/15-things- didnt-know-playwright-ins-choi/95352. Ins met his wife ‚ÄúMari‚Äù for the first time before her birthday. Years later he saw her again at a mutual friend‚Äôs wedding and finally found the courage to ask her out. According to Choi that was one of the best days of his life.Leadlay, Christina. ‚Äú15 Things You Didn't Know about Playwright Ins Choi.‚Äù The Hill Times, The Hill Times, 10 Feb. 2017, https://www.hilltimes.com/2017/02/08/15-things-didnt-know-playwright-ins- choi/95352. Choi currently lives in Canada with his wife Mari, daughter Poem, and his son River. He is enjoying family life, which was always a substantial value for him, especially since his father was a religious person and believed in the family as an institution. Career Choi's writing experience came from songwriting, poetry, and eventually play-writing. He proceeded to write for television and turned Kim‚Äôs Convenience into a popular TV show on CBC. He is an official co-creator, producer, and main screenwriter. Choi claims to take inspiration in strange places, exemplified by his play ‚ÄùThe Subway Stations of the Cross,‚Äù which Choi says was inspired by the homeless and mentally ill men he met in parks and public spaces across Toronto. He has also created the show called ‚ÄùThe Beats and Breaks,‚Äù which is about hip-hop and is currently working on The KJV: The Bible Show.

Since 1828, when an additional church was constructed about nine miles away in Eastville, which is now also one of the oldest churches in Virginia's Eastern Shore, the parish has had two churches. Christ Church Eastville on road from Northampton Courthouse History Accawmake Kingdome was the original homeland of the American Indigenous Accawmacke Indians. The Accawmake Indians are the Indigenous American Indians of Accawmacke Kingdome of Virginia. It was flourishing settlement of small towns prior to the arrival of the English immigrants. Ye Kingdome of Accawmake, or, The Eastern Shore of Virginia in the Seventh Century; Wise,Jennings C.(Jennings Cropper),B.1881. Accomack Shire was one of the eight original shires established by the English immigrants, and included what later became Accomack and Northampton counties on the Delmarva Peninsula. The first assigned clergyman was Rev. Francis Bolton. This land was patented (claimed) by Rev. John Cotton, who farmed as well as served as the parish's second rector, from about 1632 to 1645.M.C. Howard, History of Hungars Church, Northampton County (1908), available at http://genealogytrails.com/vir/northampton/hungars_church.html In that year, vestryman Robert Vaughn died and bequeathed tobacco toward construction of a church which became known as Nussawattocks Church. Northampton County was organized into two parishes divided by King's Creek in 1642, and in 1663 Accomac Parish was split off from the northern part of Hungar's Parish. In 1690, Nassawattocks Parish was merged into Hungar's Parish, and Eastville became the seat of Northampton county. Meanwhile, a wooden church was built at what was then called Church Neck by Magothy Bay. In 1653 a wealthy vestryman who had some prior disagreements with Rev. Cotton, Stephen Charlton, gave land for a glebe to support the minister, and may have given additional funds to build a church. When he died two years later, his will provided that the church would receive his estate if his daughters died. Since one was married at 12 years of age and soon died in childbirth, litigation occurred, and again after disestablishment of the Episcopal Church circa 1808.Nora Miller Turman, The Eastern shore of Virginia, 1603‚Äì1964 at pp. 60, 80, 102, 111‚Äì112 available at https://archive.org/stream/easternshoreofvi00turm/easternshoreofvi00turm_djvu.txt The Glebe of Hungar's Parish remained the official residence of the parish's ministers from 1745 until 1850, although it was sold at auction after disestablishment conditioned upon the litigation results; the last rector to live at the glebe was Francis Upton, who served until 1850. In 1679, a contract was entered into for a 40-foot-long wooden church at the Hungars site, although Maj. William Spencer did not give the parish title to the land until 1684. Since 1690, the parish has had the same boundaries as Northampton county; Mr. John Monroe became the minister the following year. The current building is the third parish church of Hungars Parish. It may have been built in 1742, perhaps as a result of a ferry to York and Hampton being located nearby since 1731, and was the second largest in Virginia before the Revolutionary war. A will in 1759 referred to a new church on Hungar's Creek. The disestablishment of the Episcopal Church circa 1802 led to the abandonment of both the Magothy and Hungars chapels, which were stripped. Remaining parishioners met at the county's courthouse in Eastville, and the parish preserved the alms basin given the Magothy Bay church by Lt. Gov. Nicholson circa 1690, as well as the 1741 communion silver given Hungars Church by John Custis (father-in-law of Martha Dandridge's first husband,Martha Washington she later married George Washington). Hungars Church was resurrected in 1819 as some prosperity returned to the area, but the ferry now had competition, a ferry to Pungoteague, i.e. the part that split off into Accomack Parish. Around the time Hungars parish lost the glebe as rector's residence, Hungars church was reported unsafe. It was renovated in 1851 by a contractor from further up the peninsula in Snow Hill, Maryland and physically shortened (from 92 feet in length, to about 74 feet) as well as having the balcony (seating for non-pew-holders, including slaves) redone. In 1884, the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad was built down the Delmarva peninsula to Cape Charles, Virginia. Its wealthy and politically connected developer, William Lawrence Scott, hired an engineer from Pocomoke City, Maryland to lay it out. The railroad, which helped the area economically and may have led to the parish's greatest prosperity (before World War I), included Eastville Station, not far from the existing town, and its terminus was close to the historic Hungars Church (although several churches, including Emmanuel Episcopal Church, as well as Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist and Catholic churches, were soon built within Cape Charles). Hungars parish was able to afford additional renovations to Hungars Church in 1892 (adding the current gallery as well as stove flues), 1922 (oak floor), and then in 1950 and 1955 (lighting, central heat, brick floor in vestibule), 1985 (air conditioning) and 1991‚Äì1992 (pulpit, wood renovation).NRIS However, ending of both railroad passenger service in 1958 and ferry service in over forty years ago has led to some stagnation, as well as development as tourist attractions. Christ Church Eastville, with cemetery and Hungars Parish Hall Meanwhile, another church was built at Eastville (current address 16304 Courthouse Rd.) in 1828, which replaced the Magothy church. Christ Church was built on land given by Severn E. Parker of Kendall Grove, although the deed was not recorded in his lifetime, but by his daughter. Bequests and memorials led to the installation of stained glass windows in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and they were renovated in 1992. The baroque pipe organ was donated in 1986. In 1974, Robert S. and Ellen B. Trower donated the adjacent land upon which the parish hall was built. Christ Episcopal Church in Eastville is considered a Virginia Historic Landmark (DHR-ID:214-0040-0055), as well as one of 315 contributing properties in the Eastville Historical District, which achieved both federal and state recognition in 2009. The current rectory (for both churches in the parish) was acquired in 1985, and is about a half mile south of Christ Church, Eastville. Architecture According to the historic survey, the building was built between 1742 and 1751, and is a one-story, brick, Colonial structure with four-bay north and south facades, two-bay end walls, and a gable roof with modillioned cornice. The building was shortened in 1851, and the cornice, roof, and floor may date from 1922. and Accompanying photo Current status The parish remains active in the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia. The Hungars Church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Neither church was included in the Cape Charles Historic District in 1991. However, the Eastville Historical District containing Christ Church was added to the National Register in 2009. The Rev. Daniel Lee Crockett currently serves as rector of both Hungars Cure churches; the parish's administrative offices are next to Christ Church in Eastville.

It was produced and directed by Wim T. Schippers who also played the principal character and radio host, Jacques Plafond. Between 10 October 1984 and 30 January 1991, 328 episodes were produced, and it became the VPRO's best-listened radio program. The show was characterized by chaos. Plafond frequently interrupted his guests and the obligatory news readers, and cut off records if he didn't like them. The regular cast included characters such as Jan Vos (Clous van Mechelen) and Wilhelmina Kuttje Jr. (Janine van Elzakker). It was notable also for the plethora of jingles; some a minute long, some jingles for jingles, and some self-referential, such as the well-known \\"Oh what a nice jingle this is\\". There were more than 100 jingles written by Schippers and van Mechelen, all archived by Nienke Feis. The show was notable also for its many puns and linguistic jokes, some of which have crept into the Dutch language. For example, Plafond invented and consistently used his own second person singular pronoun \\"joe\\", an in-between version of the two possible pronouns in Dutch, \\"je\\" (informal) and \\"u\\" (formal). Memorable moments from the show include an aborted interview with Gerard Reve on 14 December 1988 (Reve's birthday). For an entire day jingles had been hyping up the big Plafond - Reve conversation; promising sharp questions and discussions on the meaning of life; in the end, Plafond's first question was whether Reve really believed in God, to which Reve responded by saying that he didn't wish to answer a question posed that way, and hung up. A selection from Ronflonflon and other radio shows done by Schippers was released on CD in 2009, De radiopraktijken van Wim T. Schippers. Jacques Plafond Jacques Plafond, besides being the show's host, was featured in many of Schippers' television shows and other productions, such as Opzoek naar Yolanda (1984, scheduled to run concurrently with Ronflonflon) and Plafond over de vloer (1986, a television show based on the radio show). As a singer, a notable performance by Plafond was opening the Holland Festival in 1980, in the Schippers production De dans der vierkanten waarin opgenomen Elly, of het beroemde stuk (released on DVD by the VPRO). With his band \\"Jacques Plafond & his Plafonni√®res\\" he released an album in 1980, Hark!, which was remade in 2008 by the experimental arts organisation Worm as an homage to Schippers. The original has been described as \\"an almost successful pop record, with Zappa-esque excurses and a fair bit of doowop-like insanity.\\" Compilation albums with songs from the Ronflonflon shows include Geen Touw (1990) and Schippers in Plafondvaart (1992).

View of Cardiff Bay from St Augustine's Situated on Pen Arth (the Bear's Head) on Cardiff Bay, the church is able to be seen from a distance. The original church had a Norman-style tower, which was used as a navigation landmark by pilots in Bristol Channel. The first plans for the new church were for a short and square tower. Due to the complaints of the channel pilots, the plans for the new church were altered to provide for a 90-foot tower. The tower caused concern during World War II because it could have been used by the Germans as a visual guide to bomb the docks at Cardiff. The present church was commissioned by Harriet Windsor-Clive, 13th Baroness Windsor to replace a church which was no longer large enough for the growing parish. The building was designed by architect William Butterfield and built between 1865 and 1866, at the cost of ¬£10,000. The present church, which seats 1,000, was built over the site of the original church. Little of the interior has been changed since its construction. The new building's tower held six bells, which were in place not long after the completion of the church. In 1935, these bells were re-cast and a total of eight bells were made from them in the process. The church has an organ built in 1895 by William Hill & Sons. The medieval cross which was formerly in the churchyard is now inside near the Lady Chapel altar and is a Scheduled Monument. The building became Grade I listed on 4 April 1989 as the church is \\"this important architect's most ambitious building in Wales, an unspoilt textbook example of high Victorian church architecture.\\" Description The church was designed in the a spare Early English version of the then-popular Gothic Revival style with a prominent saddleback tower. The walls have Leckwith limestone facings, bath stone dressings and bands, and red Staffordshire tiles. The gables have parapets and are surmounted by carved crucifix finials and moulded kneelers. The buttresses are low and set back with steep set-offs. The four-storey tower has a corbelled saddle, corner buttresses, and triple arcades to the lower storey. The interior has polychrome brick patterns and bath stone dressings on red bricks. The stilted low-pitch chancel roof has stellar-pattern ribs and crenellated wall plates; the nave roof is steeper with wall posts to the main trusses. John Newman described the new church as \\"one of Butterfield's finest churches, big boned and austere outside, highly charged in the polychromatic patterning of its interior\\". Churchyard The churchyard was described as being in a \\"pitiful\\" state in 2015 by the Friends of St Augustine's. The group proposed to redevelop it into a public park, saying that many graves have decayed, making for hazardous walking in the churchyard. They also cited the growing cost of the churchyard's upkeep. The concept is not a new one; other churchyards in other areas have already been turned into public parks. The proposal is to create areas for seating and wildlife, while identifying the more historic grave sites. The group received a grant to assist in determining whether such a plan would work for the churchyard. Notable persons buried at St Augustine's include Welsh composer Joseph Parry. Until Penarth Cemetery was opened in 1903, the St Augustine churchyard was the only burial place in the town. There are 14 Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials in the churchyard, marking the burial place of British and Commonwealth soldiers. They commemorate 10 soldiers from the First World War and four soldiers from the First World War. One of the graves commemorates a member of the Australian Infantry.

Most of it is unparished (i.e. it does not have a civil parish council); part comes under Chorleywood Parish Council. By the time of the 2011 Census a new civil parish had been formed called Maple Cross and Mill End. All of Mill End forms part of Three Rivers District and so is administered by Three Rivers District Council and Hertfordshire County Council.  History  By 1880, Mill End had church buildings and so had become a village; it was no longer a hamlet. It contained St. Peter's Church (built in 1874-5) and a Baptist chapel. St Peter's was a small flint building with Bath-stone dressings. The village also had a paper mill, tannery, and brewery. Another notable ancient structure at Mill End was a timber-framed farmhouse called Shepherds Farm, mentioned in a 1294 subsidy roll with a reference to Robert Le Schephard. The subsidy roll of 1534 records the name of Robert Lane. The Lane family farmed there until 1773, when Joseph Lane sold the farm to Joseph Swannell. By 1839 the Thelluson trustees had bought it. They built a new farmhouse and used the original farmhouse as lodgings for single men employed on the farm. Tornado Cars used to manufacture kit cars at 90 Uxbridge Rd, Mill End. The company sold the cars either factory finished or in component form (in which case the buyer was responsible for assembling the car from the components). The first model was shown to the press in August 1958 and production of cars stopped in 1964. Tornado Cars won the 750 Motor Clubs' Six Hour Handicap Relay Race at Silverstone twice and, at its peak, employed 60 people. The new Fairway Tyre Services building on the site is called \\"Tornado House\\" as a tribute.  Government  Mill End lies within Three Rivers District and is associated with three wards of Three Rivers District Council: Mill End and Maple Cross Ward contains the part of Mill End west of Church Lane/Shepherds Lane and north of the Uxbridge Road. It also contains Heronsgate, Maple Cross, and West Hyde. The district councillors representing the ward (following the 3 May 2012 elections) are Chris Lucas, Ann Shaw OBE, and Peter Wakeling. All are Liberal Democrats. Penn Ward contains the part of Mill End east of Church Lane/Shepherds Lane and north of the Uxbridge Road. The district councillors representing the ward (following the 3 May 2012 elections) are Les Mead and Sarah Nelmes. Both are Liberal Democrats. Rickmansworth Ward contains the part of Mill End south of the Uxbridge Road. It also contains central Rickmansworth, Batchworth, Batchworth Heath, and Woodcock Hill. The district councillors representing the ward (following the 3 May 2012 elections) are Paula Hiscocks and David Sansom. Both are Conservatives. The main responsibilities of Three Rivers District Council are: * electoral registration and organising elections; * collecting Council Tax and Business Rates for itself, Chorleywood Parish Council, Hertfordshire County Council, and Hertfordshire Constabulary; * paying Council Tax Support, Housing Benefit, and Local Housing Allowance; * development control and building regulations; * licensing of alcohol, gambling, collections for charities, street trading, minicabs, and taxis; * refuse and recycling, environmental health, and pollution control (including noise pollution); * parking, abandoned vehicles, and street cleaning; * sport, parks, allotments, open spaces, cemeteries, housing, leisure, and arts. Three Rivers District lies within the county of Hertfordshire. So Mill End is also administered by Hertfordshire County Council. Three Rivers District lies within Hertfordshire Constabulary's police area. The elected Police and Crime Commissioner for Hertfordshire sets the policing budget, holds the Chief Constable to account, determines local policing priorities, and represents the views of residents. Most of Mill End is unparished, but the part of it north of Oakfield is in Chorleywood Civil Parish. This area forms the parish's Chorleywood Quickwood Ward. The parish councillor representing the ward (following the 27 May 2010 election) is Raj Khiroya, a Liberal Democrat who was the only Chorleywood Parish councillor to be elected unopposed.  Geography  London is just to the south of Mill End (Mill End borders the London Borough of Hillingdon).  Notable people  = Harry Edwin Curtis = Harry Edwin Curtis JP (known as H.E. Curtis) was living in Springwell Lodge (276 Uxbridge Road) Mill End when he died on 8 December 1948. He had been a Hertfordshire County Council alderman and a chairman of Rickmansworth Urban District Council \\"who worked for the good of Mill End for many years and who had taken great interest in the welfare of old people\\". When Springwell Avenue, Mill End was built (in December 1925), Rickmansworth Urban District Council named it after Curtis' home, Springwell Lodge. In 1953 the council named Curtis Close (which contained bungalows for old people) in commemoration of Curtis. These road names were kept in 1972 when their pre-fabricated bungalows and houses were demolished and rebuilt. = Job Lane = Job Lane (1620‚Äì1697) emigrated to America from Shepherds Farm, Mill End, in 1649 (with his brothers James and Edward). He was a carpenter who built bridges and houses in the Boston, Massachusetts area. He also imported goods from England. In 1664 Lane became the owner of 1500 acres of land in Billerica in exchange for building a mansion at Norwich, Connecticut for Fitz John Winthrop, the grandson of Governor Winthrop. This land is now one-fifth of Bedford, Massachusetts. Lane also built one of the college buildings in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He has shared his longtime exploration of the body as an instrument of theatrical expression through workshops and classes for actors, dancers, and singers, throughout the world. He was a winner of a Golden Mask award in 2006, as director of the opera Il Viaggio a Reims.  Biography  = Early life = Alain Maratrat was born in Paris into a family far from the world of art; his father was a train conductor and his mother had stopped working as a dressmaker to raise her children. He attended the Institute National des Arts du Spectacle in Brussels, Belgium from 1969-1973 and, thirty years later, joined 3 fellow students from the class of ‚Äò73 to play their younger selves in Trente Ans a Peine, a play by Jean-Claude Carri√®re, which was based on their acting aspirations and experiences at INSAS.  Career  In 1974 Maratrat was invited to join Peter Brook‚Äô s company, the International Centre for Theatre Research, and he remained an active member of the company for nearly 20 years, participating in most of the company's successful productions. He acted, experimented and traveled the world with Brook's multi-cultural assembly of actors, dancers, musicians and other performers. They participated in theatrical encounters with audiences in native villages, asylums schools and a prison, as well as traditional theaters throughout the world. Working with Brook fed and developed Maratrat's interest in creating theater that would touch and enliven ordinary people, regardless of their culture. Since leaving Brook's company, Maratrat has managed active careers as an actor (film, theater and television), theater and opera director, and acting teacher. He has performed in films by directors Claude Berri, Amos Gitai, Michel Deville and Alain Berberian and plays directed by Bruno Bayen, Philippe Mantha, Gabriel Garran, Peter Brook, Dominique M√ºhler, Bernard Sobel and Gaston Jung. Maratrat has directed theatrical productions of Ferenc Moln√°r's Liliom (1991), Dumas‚Äô The Three Musketeers (1993) and Gaston Salvatore's Staline (1994). Braz's Rencontres (1995) was staged after a year-long collective workshop. He directed Goldoni's The Impresario from Smyrna and The Dance Lesson (1996). In 1998 he directed The Conference of Birds with the Teatro Kismet and a group of international actors in Bari, Italy, and in 1999 he traveled to South Africa to direct Romeo was a Shoeshiner with social centers in the townships of Pretoria. More recent productions include Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night ÃÅs Dream (2003), Chekhov's The Three Sisters (2004), Ibsen's Peer Gynt (2004), Marivaux's The Dispute (2005), Shakespeare's The Twelfth Night (2006) and Schiller's Marie Stuart (2011). He began his career as an opera director in 1981 with The Love of Three Oranges by Prokofiev. Since then, he has directed productions including: L ÃÅ√âtoile by Chabrier (1982), Les Voyages de Monsieur Broucek by Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek, conducted by Gilbert Amy (1982), Offenbach's Les Brigands, conducted by Sir John Eliot Gardiner (1987), and Martinu's Les Trois Souhaits, conducted by Kent Nagano (1990). He was both librettist and director of Passeport Musical Pour Paris with Mstislav Rostropovich (1991). In 1992 he created the original opera Zarzuela, Historia de un Patio, followed by Saleri's Falstaff, conducted by Jean-Claude Malgoire (1996), and Kod√°ly's Harry Janos (1998), for which he also adapted the libretto. In 2004, Maratrat was contacted by Jean-Pierre Brossmann, director of the Theatre du Chatelet, about directing Rosinni's Il Viaggio a Reims. The Chatelet was co-producing the opera with maestro Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky Theater in Saint Petersburg. With Gergiev's blessing, Maratrat immediately began In depth work with the Mariinsky's Academy of Young Singers, who would be performing, and his creative team Pierre-Alain Bertola, (set design), Mireille Dessingy (costumes), and Pascal M√©rat (lighting). The vibrant and innovative opera, which premiered at the Mariinsky in 2005, was awarded two Golden Masks (Russian theater's highest award) for best opera and best director, and a Golden Sofit (best opera in St Petersburg). Maratrat's relationship with the Mariinsky Theater continued with a new version of The Love for Three Oranges in 2007 and a 360 degree staging of Mozart‚Äô s Magic Flute (2008), which has been performed more than 150 times at the world-famous opera house. Throughout his life, Maratrat has explored the relationship between the body and acting. By developing a body that is sensitive, and free, he believes an actor can best transmit the subtlest interior stirrings. From an early age, he practiced gymnastics, Judo and contemporary dance. In 1984 Brook sent him to India to study Kalarippayatt and Kathakali and to Taiwan and Hong Kong to learn Chinese martial arts and weaponry (trident, lances, swords, iron balls) in preparation for the company's epic production of the Mahabharata. Maratrat played the role of Vyassa in the French production and coached the other actors in martial arts techniques. To further his understanding, he studied T'ai chi ch'uan (with both Lizelle Reymond and her teacher Di Tchao) and Kung-fu (with Dan Schwartz). He has Practiced Eutonie (with Gerda Alexander), Feldenkrais Method, and Alexander Technique. He has taken work workshops with the Peking Opera (acrobatics and fire juggling), as well as Sumatran dance, Balinese Mask, and Javanese puppet masters. And he has practiced singing with Older Dagar Brothers Aminuddin Daga (Calcutta), as well as musical interpretation with Celibidache and other notable musical conductors. Maratrat regularly shares the results his experience with acting students though master classes, workshops and acting classes, influencing a new generation of actors, singers and dancers around the world.

He also played for many amateur teams. He was born in Leicester and died at Merton, Surrey. He was the brother of the England Test cricketer Jack Crawford and of the Leicestershire first-class cricketer Reginald Crawford. During his lifetime, he was generally referred to as \\"Frank Crawford\\". Early cricket and Surrey Though born in Leicester, Crawford was brought up in Surrey where his father had become chaplain at the Cane Hill mental hospital at Coulsdon. He was an outstanding schoolboy cricketer at Whitgift School, and played for Surrey in 1896 as a 17-year-old while still at school. At school and in early club cricket, according to a tribute to him written in the 1923 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack by his Surrey colleague Digby Jephson, he was regarded primarily as a fast bowler, and he took eight wickets in an innings for 35 runs against the full Surrey side in a minor match in 1895. The following year, according to the same source, he hit 218 before lunch in a match for Surrey's Young Amateurs side against the Young Professionals: \\"the sort of innings many of us would tramp long, weary miles to see,\\" Jephson wrote. Crawford's second first-class game after his debut in 1896 was a Gentlemen v Players match at Hastings at the end of the 1897 season when his captain was W. G. Grace. In 1898 and 1899, he appeared in around half of Surrey's first-class games and in the 1899 match against Somerset in which Surrey amassed a total of 811, he scored his first century with an innings of 129, although his effort was somewhat overshadowed by Bobby Abel's 357 not out, where the diminutive opening batsman carried his bat. Crawford played regularly for Surrey in only three seasons, from 1900 to 1902, while the side was captained by Jephson. Batting largely in the lower middle order, he was renowned for fast scoring, but Jephson wrote that \\"he was essentially a scientific hitter not a slogger\\". He added: \\"He was strictly orthodox in all his methods of attack or defence, and the straightness of his bat was a thing to marvel at... He will go down to posterity as one of the greatest straight drivers the game has known.\\" He scored more than 1,000 runs in each of the three seasons he was a regular at Surrey, with a best aggregate of 1511 runs at an average of 32.14 in 1901, when he captained the team in two games. His highest innings for Surrey was also in 1901: he scored 159 against Worcestershire at The Oval. Jephson's reminiscence in the 1923 Wisden recalled another innings in that season, in which Crawford hit flagstaffs on the two towers of the football pavilion at the Park Avenue ground, Bradford with straight drives for six. The match against Yorkshire was the first one in which Crawford captained Surrey. After the 1901 English cricket season, Crawford joined other amateurs on a tour to North America captained by Bernard Bosanquet; two of the matches against the Philadelphian cricket team were designated as first-class games. In 1902, Crawford had his nearest brush with Test selection: he was picked for \\"An England XI\\" to play the Australian touring team in a game at Eastbourne, but he did not then win further selection for the Tests that summer. Towards the end of the season, Jephson was injured and Crawford captained Surrey in eight matches; his final match for the team was against Leicestershire where the opposition included his brother Reginald. Leicestershire and later cricket In March 1903, Crawford was appointed as secretary of Leicestershire County Cricket Club. This was often a ploy used by the poorer county clubs to recruit talented cricketers of limited means: the secretarial duties were often light and mainly done by volunteers, but employment as secretary meant that a player could maintain amateur status. In Crawford's case, there were other considerations, as he had been born in Leicester and his younger brother was already a member of the team. Amateur status meant that he was available to captain the side in the absence of the regular captain, Charles de Trafford, and he did so several times in his first season with the county, 1903, and more than 30 times until his career ended in 1910. He remained as secretary to the club until the end of the 1907 season. Crawford maintained consistent batting form across his eight seasons with Leicestershire, although as the county usually played fewer matches than Surrey had done, he passed 1,000 runs in a season only in 1908 and 1909, after he had given up the secretaryship. His best year was 1908, when he made 1416 runs at an average of 32.93 and increased his highest score to 170 in an innings that took just 160 minutes and included 24 fours and four sixes against Hampshire. In 1909, he improved on that again with an innings of 172 not out against Surrey in which he made his runs out of 226 put on while he was at the wicket in just over three hours. He was less successful in 1910 and left first-class cricket at the end of the season. While at Leicestershire, Crawford also played in several other first-class matches for amateur sides, including another appearance for an \\"England XI\\" against the Australian touring team at Blackpool in which he appeared alongside his younger brother, Jack, for the only time in his career. He appeared for a second time in a Gentlemen v Players game, this time at The Oval, in his final season of 1910. After cricket At the end of the 1910 season, Crawford left England for Ceylon. He played non-first-class cricket for the Europeans team both in Sri Lanka and on tour in Burma (Myanmar), and played for the Ceylon team in matches against the MCC team on its way to Australia in 1911‚Äì12 and the Australian team on its way to England for the 1912 series. In the First World War he served with the East Surrey Regiment; he is recorded in the London Gazette as having relinquished his commission as a temporary lieutenant on 18 January 1919 \\"on account of ill-health contracted on active service\\". His obituary in The Times noted that he had died of pneumonia after many years of illness brought about through his war service.

Luther Foster, a horticulturalist and one of two faculty members, was named Acting President. Short on funds, lacking a campus, and with Montana still mostly wilderness without many professionals, the Agricultural College found it difficult to hire faculty. So it began poaching faculty from the College of Montana.Schontzler, Gail. \\"Presidential Debate: Who Were MSU‚Äôs Most Important Presidents?\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle. July 17, 2011. Accessed 2013-08-14. =Montana State University= Ryon, too, was poached from the College of Montana. He was named the first president of the college on April 17, 1893. Ryon immediately clashed with the board of trustees and faculty. Where the trustees (mostly businessmen from Bozeman, Montana) wanted the college to focus on agriculture, Ryon pointed out that few of its students intended to go back to farming. While the rapidly expanding faculty wanted to establish a remedial education program to assist unprepared undergraduates (Montana's elementary and secondary public education system was in dire shape at the time), Ryon refused. Ryon was forced out in 1895 and replaced by the Rev. Dr. James R. Reid, a Presbyterian minister who had been president of the Montana College at Deer Lodge since 1890.Smith, p. 174. Ryon returned to the faculty at the Agricultural College. He'd spent much of 1894 working on new irrigation systems and methods, and he continued to teach agricultural and mining engineering at the college. But in 1897, the Board of Regents was again growing frustrated with the focus of the college, and demanded the resignation of all faculty.

College legacy In 1911, the college began construction on a massive engineering laboratory building. Completed in 1923, the structure was named the A.M. Ryon Engineering Laboratories in 1939 in Ryon's honor. The huge structure, which had a monitor roof, contained the electrical engineering facilities and materials testing facilities.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 35. Two wings were added in 1952.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 64. For many years, the wings of the structure was leased by the engineering laboratory of the Montana State Department of Highways, while the older part of the building was turned into a gas and steam engineering laboratory. The structure was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for the new Engineering and Physical Sciences Building.Rydell, Safford, and Mullen, p. 195. Personal life Ryon married Harriet L.

He played mainly for Leicestershire from 1901 to 1907, returning for a single match in both 1910 and 1911, and also played for amateur teams. He was born in Leicester and died at Swiss Cottage, London. He was the brother of the England Test cricketer Jack Crawford and of the Surrey and Leicestershire first-class cricketer Vivian Crawford. Early career and successes Though born in Leicester, Crawford was brought up in Surrey where his father had become chaplain at the Cane Hill mental hospital at Coulsdon. He played amateur cricket in Surrey and then Minor Counties cricket for Surrey's second team in 1900. With Surrey having strength in both bowling and batting at this time, Crawford moved in 1901 to play first-class cricket for Leicestershire, having a birth qualification for the team. He became pretty much a regular in the first team as a teenager, featuring in 15 county games in his first season, though his figures were not impressive, with only 11 first-class wickets and a batting average of 13.96. The 1902 season was his best in first-class cricket. He made 852 runs at an average of 25.05 and took 40 wickets at 23.70. In late June and aged just 20, as the only amateur in the team, he was captain of what The Times referred to as \\"a scratch side playing under the title of 'An England Eleven'\\" in a \\"hastily-arranged\\" game with the Australian touring team at Bradford, put together because of the late postponement of the coronation of King Edward VII. The match, fairly easily won by the Australians, was notable for the bowling performance of Herbert Knutton, who had played one first-class match for Warwickshire in 1894 without taking a wicket and this time took nine Australian first-innings wickets for 100 runs, adding a tenth when the touring side needed just 42 to win; Knutton never played first-class cricket again. Crawford distinguished himself in the second England XI innings with a score of 90, his highest first-class score to date, \\"a fine piece of hitting (which) saved the scratch side from the ignominy of an innings defeat\\", The Times reported. A month later, Crawford improved on his best score: in the match against Worcestershire at Aylestone Road cricket ground, Leicester, he and the bowler William Odell came together with Leicestershire at 61 for eight wickets and proceeded to put on 160 for the ninth wicket. The partnership remains, 111 years on, Leicestershire's best in first-class cricket for the ninth wicket and is 75 years older than any of the county's other first-class partnership records. Crawford was left unbeaten on 99 when first Odell was run out and then, one run later, the No 11 batsman, Arthur Emmett, was also run out, without scoring. Crawford never achieved a century in first-class cricket; the 99 not out remained his best score. Later cricket career In fact, Crawford's cricket career did not really develop after 1902. He played regularly again for Leicestershire in 1903, when his older brother Vivian (usually known as \\"Frank\\"), joined the team and also acted as secretary to the county cricket club, but although Reginald managed 40 wickets again his aggregate of runs fell to 461 and his average to just 12.13; his highest score for the season was only 35. His appearances for Leicestershire became more intermittent from 1904 onwards, though he had occasional days of success with both bat and ball through to 1907. For example, in 1906, he made an unbeaten 84 in a successful rearguard action in the match against Warwickshire after Leicestershire had been forced to follow on. But all of his better bowling performances came later in his cricket career when he was playing only a few matches each season, and mainly for ad hoc amateur sides. In two matches in 1907 for H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI in first-class games against university sides he took 21 wickets in two games: he took five for 69 and five for 77 against Oxford University and followed that with four for 77 and seven for 71 against Cambridge. The second innings figures against Cambridge University proved to be the best of his first-class career. His final two matches in first-class cricket in 1911 were for Leveson Gower's team against the universities, this time the matches both being played at Eastbourne and within the space of a week; Crawford took six for 48 and four for 43 in the first of them against Cambridge University, and then two for 101 and six for 21 in the second, against Oxford. Crawford's death was reported in the 1946 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as having been \\"after a long illness\\".

It was similar to Heyuannia, but with more strongly curved anterior claws and a thinner, frailer mandible. This find is paleontologically significant because it contributes to current knowledge about the paleogeographical distribution of oviraptorids in southern China. It was most likely a herbivorus animal along with its close relatives Nankangia and Ganzhousaurus. Etymology The genus name Jiangxisaurus, refers to the Jiangxi Province of southern China. The specific name ganzhouensis, is derived from Ganzhou, the locality where the specimen was discovered. Jiangxisaurus was described and named by Wei Xuefang, Pu Hanyong, Xu Li, Liu Di, and L√º Junchang in 2013 and the type species is Jiangxisaurus ganzhouensis. Description The holotype specimen HGM41-HIII0421 consists of an incomplete skull, a lower jaw, eight cervical vertebrae, three dorsal vertebrae, nine caudal vertebrae, a nearly complete pectoral girdle, two chevrons, the left forelimb, both sternal plates, four sternal ribs, nine dorsal ribs, and a partially preserved pelvic girdle. The skull is 150mm long and appears to be a sub-adult. The mandible of Jiangxisaurus is toothless and has a height-to-length ratio of about 20%. The radius is 96mm in length and is 30% shorter than the length of the humerus (136mm). The manus is tridactyl, meaning that it has three fingers ‚Äì the first digit is robust, the second is elongated and the third digit is slender. Classification Jiangxisaurus was assigned to the taxon oviraptoridae. This genus shares several traits with other oviraptorids, including a short narrow skull with a toothless jaw, and anterior cerivcal vertebrae that bear pleurocoels. In contrast to its nearest relatives, Jiangxisaurus has an elongated mandible and a less pronounced down-turned rostrum on its lower jaw. =Distinguishing anatomical features= A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Wei et al. (2013), Jiangxisaurus was a medium-sized oviraptorid dinosaur characterized by the following unique characters: * the presence of a weakly down-turned mandibular symphysis * a suprangular bone with an elongated and concave lateral surface * a very elongated mandible, with a height-to-length ratio of about 20% * a ratio of radius length to humerus length of about 70% Paleoecology =Provenance and occurrence= The only known specimen of this genus was recovered at the Nankang locality of the Nanxiong Formation in Ganzhou City of Jiangxi Province, China. The specimen was collected in red sandstone sediments that were deposited during the Maastrichtian stage of the Cretaceous period, approximately 72 to 66 million years ago. The type specimen is currently housed at the Henan Geological Museum (HGM). =Fauna and habitat= The Nanxiong Formation consists of a 2000-meter sequence of red sandstones and clays which has yielded dinosaur fossils, dinosaur footprints and abundant egg shells. Jiangxisaurus shared its paleoenvironment with the sauropod Gannansaurus, the duckbill Microhadrosaurus, the therizinosauroid Nanshiungosaurus, the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus and other two oviraptorids, Banji and Ganzhousaurus.

Described as an \\"important member of the Wimbledon family\\", Rufus has been scaring away the birds for fifteen years, taking over from the previous hawk, Hamish. The All England Club employ Rufus to patrol their 42-acre grounds throughout the year, with daily visits during the two weeks of The Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics. Pigeons are particularly attracted to the roof of the centre court. He has also been employed to scare pigeons away from Westminster Abbey, various hospitals, airfields, and landfill sites. On 28 June 2012 Rufus was stolen from the back of his owner's car while it was parked on a private drive. He would usually be driven back to his home in Corby, Northamptonshire, but his owner had chosen to stay in London. The theft caused a \\"global outcry\\" with significant coverage in the media leading to Rufus being named \\"the world's most notable bird\\" and \\"one of Britain's best-known birds\\". He was found three days later on Wimbledon Common and handed into the RSPCA. The bird was healthy with the only injury being a slightly sore leg. Rufus usually wears a radio transmitter by which he could have been tracked, but it is removed from him at night. In June 2013 it was reported that Rufus was scared by people in hoods and that he had been chased off by crows. Rufus has also been featured by Stella Artois in their advertising series 'Here's To Perfection'.

Shrage (born December 4, 1953) is an American political and moral philosopher whose analysis of the agendas for social change advanced by gender and sexual dissidents has been influential. Education and career Shrage has taught at Howard University, Lake Forest College, Scripps College, California State Polytechnic University, and now teaches at Florida International University. She earned her B.A. (1975) from the University of California, Davis and her M.A. (1979) and Ph.D (1983) from the University of California, San Diego, Philosophy. In her first book, Moral Dilemmas of Feminism: Prostitution, Adultery, and Abortion (1994), Shrage argued for empirically informed philosophical analyses of moral problems. She argued against the possibility of offering a universal social ethics and, as an alternative, she developed an interpretive approach to moral problems, based in part on the work of Charles Taylor. Her second book, Abortion and Social Responsibility: Depolarizing the Debate (2003), argues for reconsidering the American Law Institute‚Äôs model abortion law developed prior to Roe v. Wade. Shrage explores abortion policies around the world, the history of reform and repeal movements in the U.S., moral and legal debates, and ethnographies of pro-life and pro-choice groups, and then recommends restricting elective abortions to roughly the end of the first trimester, in order to balance competing rights and values. Shrage was a Laurance S. Rockefeller Visiting Fellow at the Center for Human Values at Princeton University (2011-12) and a fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center (1998-99). She was a co-editor of the journal Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy from 1998-2003. She has served as the American Philosophical Association‚Äôs Ombuds for Non- Discrimination, 2008-11, and as the Program Chair for the American Philosophical Association, Pacific Division meeting in 2001. She was Director of Women‚Äôs Studies at FIU (2008-11). Research areas Shrage's work evaluates public policies on markets in sexual services and expressive materials, reproductive health care, legal gender identity, and marriage. She is more interested in the active application of philosophical theory to inform public debate - in what she terms \\"empirically informed philosophy\\" - than she is in focusing her work on a particular school of philosophical thought. She suggests that moral and political philosophers should pay more attention to historical and scientific accounts of political and moral problems than they currently do.

It depicts a female baboon standing up, holding its offspring. Picasso made the sculpture at his villa near Vallauris in October 1951, adding some plaster modelling to an assemblage of items. An example of the use of found objects in art, the assemblage includes two toy cars forming the female baboon's head, a pottery jar for its body, and an automobile spring for its tail. Background Picasso's domestic arrangements found expression in his artwork in figures of nurturing or caring. La guenon et son petit was prefigured by his sculpture Homme et mouton (\\"Man and sheep\\") made in Paris in October 1944 and exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in October 1945; a cast was unveiled in the centre of Vallauris in 1950. It was followed by his 1950 works Femme enceinte (\\"Pregnant woman\\"), Ch√®vre (\\"She-Goat\\") and Femme √† la pousette (\\"Woman with pushchair\\"), taking inspiration from Fran√ßoise and the children. All use the technique of assemblage which Picasso has used since at least 1914. La guenon et son petit can be seen as the pinnacle and ultimate end point of this line of work using free modelling added to found objects. Assemblage The cars that form the baboon's head were given to Picasso's son Claude Picasso in 1951 by the art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. As Fran√ßoise later explained, Claude as an infant had a tendency to break his toys with a hammer, but the cars remained whole until his father borrowed them later in 1951. Picasso placed one car on top of the other, with their undersides together. On top was a model of a Panhard Dyna X, with its windscreen forming the baboon's eyes, and the car's bonnet for the nose. Underneath was an upside-down Renault, reversed so its boot is the baboon's lower jaw. Picasso used a rounded pignate pot to create baboon's body, cutting it with a knife to outline breasts and nipples. The pot's volute handles created the animal's shoulders. The handles of other broken pottery (cups or pitchers) served for its ears, and its legs were made of wood, with a tail formed by an automobile's leaf spring. Picasso added plaster to complete the model, including the baboon's arms holding a baby that appears like a small human figure, creating a figure reminiscent of a Madonna and Child. The completed work measures . It was cast in bronze using a lost wax process at the Valsuani foundry in Paris. The plaster original is held by the Mus√©e Picasso in Paris. Interpretation By the time when the sculpture was made in 1951, Picasso's relationship with Fran√ßoise was worsening, and he had started an affair with poet Genevi√®ve Laporte. The Panhard may be a reference to a road trip that Picasso took with Laporte in late July 1950, travelling in a Panhard with poet Paul √âluard and his second wife, Dominique, to Eluard's apartment in Saint-Tropez. Although the baboon appears to be female, it may be intended to represent the nurturing side of Picasso himself ‚Äì then a 70-year- old man, balding with prominent ears, but stocky and powerful, with penetrating eyes. The baby may represent a human child ‚Äì a reversal of the human figure carrying an animal in Homme at mouton. Fran√ßoise ended her relationship with Picasso in 1953, taking Claude and Paloma to Paris. Subsequently, his interest in children as subjects diminished. He continued to make small sculptures, and later monumental steel works, but left behind his playful assemblages. Examples are held by a variety of public museums An example cast in 1951 sold a Christie's in November 2002 for $6,719,500.

Carl Nesjar (n√© Carlsen; 6 July 1920 ‚Äì 23 May 2015) was a Norwegian painter, sculptor and graphic artist. He is best known for his collaborations with Pablo Picasso; serving for nearly twenty years as Picasso's chosen fabricator ‚Äî the artist who turned Picasso's drawings and scale models into large public sculptures. One such work was Picasso's Regjeringskvartalet murals which are located in Oslo, the city where Nesjar lived for most of his life. He is also known for his series of \\"Ice Fountains‚Äù which can be found in cities around the world. Life and career Born Carl Carlsen in Larvik, Nesjar was raised in Southern Norway and in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He studied art at the Pratt Institute, Columbia University, and in Oslo and Paris. Towards the beginning of his career he assumed the name 'Nesjar', the Norse word for the coastal area around Larvik. Nesjar collaborated with architect Erling Viksj√∏ on a particular concrete sculpting method called Betograve. The introduction of this technique to Picasso led to a lasting collaboration between the two, starting with the realization of a version of the sculpture T√™te de femme in gravel and concrete in 1958. Over the next 15 years Nesjar and Picasso created more than 30 sculptures together. Examples of their work can be found on the campuses of New York University, Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as in public spaces in Norway, France, Spain and Israel among other nations. Nesjar died in Oslo on 23 May 2015 at the age of 94.

Each cell incorporates structural material and a reversible interlock, allowing lattices of arbitrary size and shape. RCCM display three-dimensional symmetry derived from the geometry as linked. The discrete construction of reversibly assembled cellular composites introduces a new degree of freedom that determines global functional properties from the local placement of heterogeneous components. Because the individual parts are literally finite elements, a hierarchical decomposition describes the part types and their combination in a structure. RCCM can be viewed as a ‚Äúdigital‚Äù material in which discrete parts link with a discrete set of relative positions and orientations. An assembler can place them using only local information. Placement errors can be detected and corrected by assembly reversal. These materials combine the size and strength of composites with the low density of cellular materials and the convenience of additive manufacturing.  History  RCCM were introduced in 2013 by researchers at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms.  Behavior  = Elasticity = RCCM lattices behave as an elastic solid in both tension and compression. They offer both a linear regime and a nonlinear super-elastic deformation mode a modulus an order of magnitude breater than for an ultralight material (12.3 megapascals at a density of 7.2 mg per cubic centimeter). Bulk properties can be predicted from component measurements and deformation modes determined by the placement of part types. Site locations are locally constrained, yielding structures that merge desirable features of carbon fiber composites, cellular materials and additive manufacturing. Nonlinear elastic behavior derives from a multi-axial elastic instability of the lattice, a complex coordinated elastic buckling of the strut members. The resulting geometry is similar to a Jahn‚ÄìTeller distortion of an octahedral complex with respect to orientation about the octahedral centers. Elastic folding or pleating can occur in three dimensions, likely a coordinated antisymmetric twisting stress response and/or plastic deformation. = Failure = Unlike conventional composites, which typically fail catastrophically, RCCM fail incrementally because of the non- linear deformation phase and the multiplicity of joints and links. These results matched finite-element simulationsANSYS software with finely-meshed rigid body models. In addition to convergence to the observed coordinated buckling mode, these simulations accurately predict the relative strength scaling observed in load test experiments. These results are consistent with the observation that open-cell lattice materials fail through micro-structural strut bending failures with œÉmax ‚àù. The simulations also suggest that the coordinated buckling phenomenon as well as the modulus measurements are not dominated by edge effects, with minimal influence on overall results beyond characteristic lengths exceeding several units. Varying the locations of more and less rigid elements can trigger pure axial compression, simple uni- directional Euler buckling and complex buckling. = Scaling = Cellular composites extend stretch-dominated lattices to the ultralight regime (below ten milligrams per cubic centimeter). Performance depends positively on the framework rigidity of the lattice, node connectivity, slenderness of strut members and the scaling of the density cost of mechanical connections. Conventional fiber composites make truss cores and structural frames, with bonded assembly of substructures or continuous fiber winding. Examples of such truss cores have been reported with continuous two-dimensional (2D) geometric symmetry and nearly ideal but highly anisotropic specific modulus scaling. Three-dimensional open-cell lattice materials occur in natural and engineered systems, spanning many length scales. Their mechanical properties scale with relative density according to the geometry. They display either stretch- dominated or transverse beam bending-dominated microstructural behavior, based on periodic mechanical models. For Young‚Äôs modulus E, ideal stretch-dominated scaling with density œÅ follows a proportional law E‚àùœÅ, while common stochastic foams follow a quadratic law E‚àùœÅ2 otherwise associated with transverse beam bending-dominated behavior. At ultralight densities a further reduced cubic scaling law E‚àùœÅ3 is common, such as with aerogels and aerogel composites. The dependence of scaling on geometry is seen in periodic lattice-based materials that have nearly ideal E‚àùœÅ scaling, with high node connectedness relative to stochastic foams. These structures have previously been implemented only in relatively dense engineered materials. For the ultralight regime the E‚àùœÅ2 scaling seen in denser stochastic cellular materials applies to electroplated tubular nickel micro-lattices, as well as carbon-based open-cell stochastic foams, including carbon microtube aerographite and graphene cork.  Design  Making the connections stiffer and stronger than the strut members means that stress response is governed by the struts. Extending dimensional scaling methods to include the connections shows that the mass density cost of robust connections ‚Äì which scale with the strut's cross-sectional area ‚Äì is low for ultralight materials, where strut diameter dominates mass density scaling. The relative density (œÅ/œÅs) of these materials is the sum of the relative density contribution of the strut members (œÅm/œÅs) and the relative density contribution of the connections (œÅc/œÅs). The strut members have a thickness t and length l. The connections transfer forces through load-bearing surface contacts, requiring that the characteristic dimensions of the connections scale with the cross section of the attached strut members, t2, because this dimension determines the maximum stress transferable through the joint. These definitions give a cubic scaling relation between the relative mass contribution of the joints and the strut's thickness-to-length ratio (œÅc/œÅs ‚àù Cc(t/l)3, where Cc is the connection contribution constant determined by the lattice geometry). The struts' relative density contribution scales quadratically with the thickness-to-length ratio of the struts (œÅm/œÅs ‚àù Cm (t/l)2), which agrees with the literature on classical cellular materials. Mechanical properties (such as modulus and strength) scale with overall relative density, which in turn scales primarily with the strut and not the connection, considering only open cell lattices with slender struts [t/l < 0.1 (7)], given that the geometric constants Cc and Cm are of the same order of magnitude [œÅ/œÅs ‚àù Cc (t/l)3 + Cm (t/l)2]. The density cost of the mechanical joints decreases with increasing strut member slenderness (decreasing t/l) and decreasing relative density. Tiling the cross-shaped parts forms the lattice structure. Each part contributes four conjoined strut members to one locally central node and one strut to four peripheral nodes. A shear clip inserted through the four coincident connection holes links the cells. Each cell includes aligned fiber composite beams and looped fiber load-bearing holes that reversibly chain together to form volume-filling lattices. Mass-produced cells can be assembled to fill arbitrary structural shapes, with a resolution prescribed by the part scale that matches the variability of an application's boundary stress. The periodic nature of assemblies simplifies behavior analysis and prediction. = Cuboct geometry = A ‚Äúcuboct‚Äù cubic lattice of vertex connected octahedrons, similar to the perovskite mineral structure provides a regular polyhedral unit cell that satisfies Maxwell‚Äôs rigidity criterion and has a coordination number z of eight. The dependence of the relative density on the coordination number is small relative to the dependence on strut diameter. Winding the reinforcing fibers around the connection holes optimizes their load bearing capacity, while coupling them to struts which themselves retain uniaxial fiber orientation.  Comparison with traditional composite materials  Carbon-fiber reinforced composite materials can improve efficiency in engineered systems (for example, airframes) by reducing structural weight for given strength and stiffness requirements, but present challenges with manufacturing and certification. High-performance composite components employ many continuous fibers that span the shape of a component, and are embedded in a resin matrix. Such parts typically require custom tooling, pressurization for consolidation and heated curing. Joining such parts adds complexity and structural vulnerabilities. RCCM eliminate the need for custom tooling because parts can be incrementally added/removed. Their construction, modification, repair and re-use can all employ the same reversible linking process. Heterogeneous elements can be incorporated in structures with functions determined by their relative placement. Exact assembly of discrete cellular composites offers new properties and performance not available with the analog alternatives of continuously depositing or removing material.

Up until 1989 the club had only had five different managers. Before the appointment of Gianfranco Zola in 2008 the club never had an overseas manager, with the only non-Englishman being the Scot, Lou Macari. The most recent manager is the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, appointed in May 2018 on a three year deal - succeeding David Moyes, who was appointed on a short-term contract after Slaven Biliƒá was sacked in November 2017. Before Biliƒá, the club was managed by Sam Allardyce, who was appointed in May 2011 and left in May 2015. Numerous former West Ham players have taken on temporary managerial roles at the club, between permanent managers. Ronnie Boyce briefly took the reins, in February 1990, between Macari's resignation and the appointment of Billy Bonds. Former Hammer's player and board member Trevor Brooking was briefly in charge during two separate spells as caretaker manager in 2003, first during the illness of Glenn Roeder and again between Roeder's sacking and the appointment of Alan Pardew. Former player Kevin Keen has been caretaker manager twice; immediately prior to Gianfranco Zola's appointment in 2008 and after the sacking of Avram Grant in 2011. The most recent manager Manuel Pellegrini was sacked on 28 December 2019 after a poor spell of results. Managers Prior to the appointment of West Ham's first manager, team selection was the responsibility of a committee. Lew Bowen served as secretary for the club's initial season of 1900‚Äì01. =Syd King= In May 1902, West Ham appointed full-back Syd King as secretary-manager. King had replaced Bowen as secretary at the start of the 1901‚Äì02 season, combining the role with his playing duties. A player with West Ham's predecessor team Thames Ironworks, he continued to play for the newly formed club until 1903. He remained manager until 1932, when he was sacked. He later committed suicide. =Charlie Paynter= King was replaced by Charlie Paynter, who had been appointed reserve-team trainer in 1902 and was promoted to first-team trainer when Syd King was appointed as manager. Paynter was appointed on 1 November 1932. =Ted Fenton= Paynter remained as manager until 1950 when he was replaced by Ted Fenton on 1 August 1950. Fenton was a PT instructor for the Army in North Africa and Burma during World War II. He had, since 1948, been Paynter's assistant manager. Fenton's greatest achievement was in winning the Division Two championship in the 1957‚Äì58 season and thereby securing the club top flight football for the first time since 1932.Promotion party paves the way West Ham United F.C. The 1957‚Äì58 and 1958‚Äì59 seasons saw West Ham achieve two goalscoring records; in 1957‚Äì58, the club scored 101 league goals, and in 1958‚Äì59, the club scored 59 home league goals in a season, which was even more remarkable it being the season following promotion to Division One. During his time, Fenton was responsible for establishing the Academy and the development of youth teams that reached the FA Youth Cup final twice in three years over the period 1956‚Äì59. With the help of chairman Reg Pratt, he was also responsible for encouraging as many players as possible to take their FA Coaching Badges to ensure the players had something to fall back on when their playing days were over. Seven of the West Ham 1964 FA Cup winning team had either been signed by Ted Fenton from other clubs, or had worked their way up from The Academy during his time as manager. Fenton's departure from West Ham in March 1961 has never been fully explained by the club. Under strain and on sick-leave and with West Ham's league position suffering, he left the club under circumstances which both he and the club decided would remain confidential. =Ron Greenwood= In April 1961, Pratt selected Ron Greenwood as manager. His reign at West Ham brought them sizeable success. He oversaw the development of players such as the 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning trio of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, and under him the Hammers won the FA Cup in 1964 and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965, the first two major trophies of their history. He moved upstairs in 1974, becoming the club's general manager for the next three years, with John Lyall being placed in charge of the first team. =John Lyall= Lyall was appointed on 16 April 1974. In 1975, at the end of his first season as manager, West Ham won the FA Cup final and reached the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup the following year, losing 4‚Äì2 to Anderlecht. West Ham, however, slipped down to the Second Division in 1978. Lyall attempted to rebuild the side and made significant purchases in Phil Parkes, ¬£565,000 from Queens Park Rangers, a world record for a goalkeeper and Ray Stewart from Dundee United for ¬£430,000, a British record for a teenager. West Ham returned to the First Division in 1981, winning the title by a 13-point margin. During their exile from the top flight, on 10 May 1980 West Ham beat Arsenal in the FA Cup final, the last lower league side to do so. In their 1981 promotion season, Lyall also led the Hammers to the final of the League Cup ‚Äì where they drew 1‚Äì1 against Liverpool, before losing the replay 2‚Äì1, having led early in the match. They also reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup in the same year. West Ham spent the first four years back in the top flight consolidating their position. Long serving Trevor Brooking and Frank Lampard both retired and Billy Bonds was struggling with the effects of first team football. Lyall again attempted to rebuild the team bringing Frank McAvennie from St Mirren and Mark Ward from Oldham Athletic. 28 goals from McAvennie, 25 from Tony Cottee and an eighteen-game unbeaten run saw Lyall take West Ham to their highest ever league finish in the 1985‚Äì1986 First Division campaign when they finished third behind champions Liverpool and runners-up Everton. However, they were unable to compete in the UEFA Cup because of the ban on English teams from European competition arising from the previous year's Heysel Disaster. Lyall failed to build on the side which finished third in the First Division. McAvennie was sold to Celtic in 1987 and Cottee to Everton in July 1988 for a British transfer record of ¬£2.05 million. Their replacements combined with the additions of Tommy McQueen, Gary Strodder, David Kelly, Allen McKnight, Liam Brady, Julian Dicks and the return of McAvennie in March 1989 failed to save West Ham from relegation in May 1989. Lyall was sacked on 5 June 1989. He was awarded an ex gratia payment of ¬£100,000 but left the club in what Lyall described as \\"upsetting\\" circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme. Lyall left West Ham after 34 years service. =Lou Macari= For their next manager, West Ham did not appoint from within the club ‚Äì former Swindon Town manager Lou Macari was given the job on 3 July 1989. He had a reputation for discipline and tried to change the training and dietary habits of the players. This met with some disapproval within the playing ranks. Macari bought in new recruits in future regular players, Ludƒõk Miklo≈°ko, Trevor Morley, Martin Allen and Ian Bishop. His team struggled to make much headway towards promotion and by the end of 1989 were in tenth place in The Second Division. They were also knocked out of the FA Cup by Torquay United on 6 January 1990 in the Third Round. Shortly after, it emerged that Macari was being investigated for betting irregularities while at his former club, Swindon Town. =Billy Bonds= Billy Bonds Ronnie Boyce Macari resigned in February 1990 in order to \\"clear his name\\". Former player Ronnie Boyce stood in as manager for a single game. The next manager was Billy Bonds, a popular choice who took-up the post on 23 February 1990. It was too late for Bonds to turn the season around, however, and they finished seventh. In the following season, with Trevor Morley scoring 17 goals and McAvennie 11, Bonds guided West Ham to second place and promotion to the First Division and an FA Cup semi-final place before being beaten in controversial circumstances by Nottingham Forest. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. New players Mike Small and Clive Allen were unable to provide the goals and the team finished bottom with only nine wins, only three after the turn of the new year. With the club now back in the second tier, Bonds appointed Harry Redknapp as his assistant at the start of the season. Bond's West Ham finished second and again gained promotion, this time to the FA Premier League. With Morley and Allen scoring 40 goals, they gained promotion on the last day of the season with a 2‚Äì0 home win against Cambridge United. With the team in the FA Premier League there was a need to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was recruited for a fee of ¬£1.2 million. Shortly after arriving at the club, he complained that he should not have made the move as it was too far from his Oxford home. Bonds found this attitude hard to understand compared with his own committed, never-say-die style. This was the first evidence of his losing appetite for the modern game and modern player. Fifty- eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon for a club-record combined fee of ¬£800,000, which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction; Whitbread was valued at ¬£750,000 in the deal.Coventry ask Babb bidders to raise offers Liverpool made to wait Assistant manager Harry Redknapp was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club, AFC Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position the West Ham board and their managing director, Peter Storrie made a controversial move. Anxious not to lose Redknapp's services the West Ham board offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club, on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club. His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling. Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, \\"If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation. We're sad that Bill is going, and it's a big blow but it's time to move on and we have appointed a great manager.\\" Harry Redknapp =Harry Redknapp= Redknapp became manager on 10 August 1994. His time at West Ham was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of ¬£16 million, even after the ¬£18 million sale of Rio Ferdinand. Some, however, were notably successful, such as the signings of Stuart Pearce, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic and Ian Wright. Some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu, Davor ≈†uker (who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand yet made only eight appearances), Christian Bassila (who cost ¬£720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football), Titi Camara, Gary Charles (whose wages amounted to ¬£4.4 million but made only three starts for the club), Rigobert Song, Paolo Futre and Marco Boogers (a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League). His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks. His third season saw another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson who added the impetus needed at the season's end. In 1999, the club finished in fifth position, their highest place since 1986. They also won the Intertoto Cup to qualify for the UEFA Cup. Things started to falter for Redknapp with the sale for ¬£18m to Leeds United of Rio Ferdinand in November 2000. Redknapp used the transfer money poorly with purchases such as Ragnvald Soma (who cost ¬£800,000 and played only seven league games), Camera and Song. Redknapp felt he needed more funds with which to deal in the transfer market. Chairman Brown lost patience with Redknapp due to his demands for further transfer funds. In May 2001, he left the club following a meeting with Brown and a dispute over the club's potential summer transfer fund. His assistant Frank Lampard, Sr., also left, making the sale of his son Frank Lampard, Jr., inevitable; in the summer of 2001, he joined Chelsea for ¬£11 million. =Glenn Roeder= Trevor Brooking With several names such as former player Alan Curbishley now linked with the job, chairman Brown recruited from within the club. Reserve team coach Glenn Roeder was appointed manager on 9 May 2001. He had already failed in management with Gillingham, where he lost 22 of the 35 games he managed, and Watford. His first big signings were the return of Don Hutchison for ¬£5 million and Czech centre-back Tom√°≈° ≈òepka. Finishing seventh in his first season Roeder made the error of not buying new players for the 2002‚Äì03 season. Numerous fall outs with Paolo Di Canio and a series of injuries to Fr√©d√©ric Kanout√© left the team with too few strikers. They took until 28 September 2002 to win their first game. Veterans Les Ferdinand, Rufus Brevett and Lee Bowyer were recruited in the winter of 2002 but results barely improved. Bowyer's transfer in January 2003 was controversial and Roeder came under criticism for signing him. After a game against Middlesbrough, Roeder, in his office at Upton Park, suffered a blocked blood vessel in his brain. Now needing medical help and recuperation, former stalwart Trevor Brooking stood in as caretaker manager. Despite not losing another match, the Hammers were relegated on the last day of the season at Birmingham City with a record for a relegated club of 42 points. Nine seasons of top tier football were over. Many top players ‚Äì including Joe Cole, Paolo Di Canio and Fr√©d√©ric Kanout√© ‚Äì all left the club. The next season now in the second tier Roeder resumed as manager. Results were still poor and after an away defeat to Rotherham United, he was sacked on 24 August 2003. Brooking again took over as caretaker. He lost only one game, a 2‚Äì0 away defeat to Gillingham and is known as \\"the best manager West Ham never had\\". =Alan Pardew= Alan Pardew Former Crystal Palace player and the manager of Reading, Alan Pardew was lined up to be the next manager. Reading and their chairman, John Madejski, were reluctant to let him leave. After serving a period of notice and gardening leave and with West Ham paying Reading ¬£380,000 in compensation, he was appointed manager on 18 October 2003, their tenth permanent manager. Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in Nigel Reo-Coker, Marlon Harewood and Brian Deane. In his 1st season in charge they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace. His signings of Bobby Zamora, Matthew Etherington and veterans Chris Powell and Teddy Sheringham saw West Ham finishing in sixth position and subsequently beating Preston North End 1‚Äì0, thanks to a Zamora goal, in the 2005 playoff final to return to the Premier League. Of securing promotion, Pardew said, \\"It's a team effort. We defended well and we're back where we belong.\\" In the 2005‚Äì06 season, having signed striker Dean Ashton he guided them to ninth place and an FA Cup final where they were beaten on penalties by Liverpool. In the close season, Pardew signed Carlton Cole from Chelsea, with Pardew saying of the deal, \\"This is a great coup for West Ham. Several clubs came in for Carlton and it is a great compliment to what we have achieved here, that he has signed for us.\\" The 2006‚Äì07 season started poorly. Now back playing in Europe in the UEFA Cup, they were beaten in the first round 4‚Äì0 by Palermo. The team went ten games without a win and in October 2006 they were beaten in the League Cup by fourth tier side Chesterfield. The club were on their worst run of results for 74 years. Pardew was acting more like a highly paid player than a manager by turning up for training driving an expensive Ferrari car and was boasting of his wealth having earned ¬£1.5 million in bonuses in the previous season. His actions did not help team morale. There were accusations that several young players had got carried away with one successful season in the top flight. After a 4‚Äì0 away defeat to Bolton Wanderers, Pardew was sacked on 11 December 2006 by new chairman Eggert Magn√∫sson. =Alan Curbishley= Alan Curbishley The new owners wasted little time is searching for a replacement, and on 13 December 2006, Alan Curbishley was appointed. During his 15 years as manager of Charlton Athletic, Curbishley produced an established mid-table side. He continued in the same vein at West Ham and in his first season in charge, 2006‚Äì07, they finished 15th in the Premier League. He was also required to deal with the controversy caused under Pardew's managership by the signings of Argentine internationals Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez. He rarely used Mascherano who made only five league appearances. He also had a poor relationship with Tevez. West Ham struggled and were embroiled in problems with the FA over the legalities concerning the contracts of Mascherano and Tevez. Curbishley finally consistently picked Tevez at the start of 2008. His 26 games and 7 goals proved to be vital. West Ham maintained their Premier League status only on the last day of the season, with Tevez scoring the only goal at Old Trafford against Manchester United. Many, including Lord Griffiths, who ruled on the legality of Tevez's contract, thought maintaining their Premier League had been as much to do with the efforts of Tevez as the management skills of Curbishley. Tevez left the club in the summer and Curbishley produced what he was renowned for; a comfortable mid-table finish of tenth place with a degree of stability in defence due to the performances of Lucas Neil and Matthew Upson. The start of the next season saw him in conflict with the management. Suffering financially due to the effects of the 2008‚Äì11 Icelandic financial crisis on chairman and owner, Bj√∂rg√≥lfur Gu√∞mundsson, who had seen his wealth disappear, and because of the costly signings of players such as Kieron Dyer, Craig Bellamy and Freddie Ljungberg, the board saw fit to transfer players without the manager's approval. Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney were sold to Sunderland against Curbishley's wishes. As he was contractually in control of all first team transfers, Curbishley felt he had no choice but to resign, on 3 September 2008. Kevin Keen was appointed as caretaker while the search for a new manager went underway. =Gianfranco Zola= Zola Avram Grant The next manager was another, like Glenn Roeder, untried at the top level: the Italian Gianfranco Zola was appointed on 15 September 2008. His only other managerial role being the Italy national under-21 team. His first season brought a ninth-place Premier League finish largely through the 12 league goals of Carlton Cole, the only West Ham player to make double figures. Zola's second, however, was a continual fight near the bottom of the league table, with the club finishing 17th and only five points away from relegation. His transfers dealings, particularly the reportedly club record ¬£9 million fee paid for untried teenager Savio Nsereko, had failed to enhance the team. He also signed South African international striker Benni McCarthy, who failed to score at all. By this time, the new club owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, were in place and the club ¬£38 million in debt. They sought out a more experienced manager and on 11 May 2010, Zola was sacked after less than two years as manager. Zola later admitted he had lacked the experience to tackle the pressures of top- flight management. =Avram Grant= Israeli Avram Grant had been manager with Chelsea and had taken them to the UEFA Champions League final in 2008. He was appointed on 3 June 2010. His signings of Pablo Barrera and Fr√©d√©ric Piquionne added little to the team. His teams performed poorly and although he brought in striker Demba Ba, West Ham were relegated in May 2011. Grant was sacked on the day of relegation. He had been in charge for less than a year. Kevin Keen stood in for one game as manager, a 3‚Äì0 home defeat to Sunderland. The mood at the club was low. Club co-chairman David Sullivan later admitted he had made an error in employing Grant as manager. =Sam Allardyce= Allardyce at the Boleyn Ground In the summer of 2011, the West Ham owners turned to experienced manager Sam Allardyce. His years with Bolton Wanderers had seen a style of long ball football, but had also seen them qualify for European competition. He signed new captain, Kevin Nolan, whom he had worked with before at Bolton and Newcastle United. Despite Allardyce's style of play coming under criticism from fans, he guided West Ham to immediate promotion. After finishing third in the Championship, they won the 2012 play-off final against Blackpool at Wembley to gain promotion. In his first Premier League season as manager, the club finished tenth and Allardyce was rewarded with a new contract in May 2013. In July 2013, co-chairman David Gold defended Allardyce's style of football, saying, \\"Sam could not be described as a pussy cat or a cute panda, someone you might want to pick up and give a big cuddle to and that is why he may be hard to love, but you cannot question the job he has done at West Ham.\\" Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, the final day of the Premier League season, after his contract was not renewed. Informed of the club's decision not to renew his contract on 22 May, Allardyce said that he had already decided not to renew saying, \\"I didn't want to stay. I suppose you could say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either.\\" His West Ham side had finished 12th in the League, one place higher than in 2013‚Äì14, but after a promising start to the 2014‚Äì15 season, poor results meant supporters had turned against him. =Slaven Biliƒá= On 9 June 2015, Slaven Biliƒá was appointed as the club's new manager on a two-year contract, after having left Be≈üikta≈ü in May. As a former West Ham player, he made 54 appearances as a defender between 1996 and 1997. Biliƒá was already a fan favourite due to his time playing at the club. Upon joining, he said, \\"I remember West Ham as a special club. My last club, Be≈üikta≈ü, was that kind of club. It's not about the size ‚Äî there is something special about them ‚Äî they are a cult club.\\" In Biliƒá's first season as manager, West Ham finished seventh in the Premier League. Biliƒá was sacked on 6 November 2017. =David Moyes= Former Preston North End, Everton, Manchester United, Real Sociedad and Sunderland manager David Moyes was appointed as successor to Slaven Biliƒá on 7 November 2017. Moyes was brought in with the club 18th in the league and flirting with relegation. The club ended the season in 13th position, with Moyes overseeing 9 wins and 10 draws from his 31 games in charge. On 16 May 2018, it was confirmed that Moyes' contract had not been renewed and that he had left his role at West Ham. =Manuel Pellegrini= Manuel Pellegrini was appointed as the new manager of the club and as a successor of David Moyes on 22 May 2018, after having left his previous club Hebei China Fortune. In Pellegrini‚Äôs first season in charge West Ham finished in 10th place, their first top ten place since 2016. West Ham broke their transfer record twice under Pellegrini paying ¬£36m for Felipe Anderson in 2018 and ¬£45m for striker Sebastien Haller in 2019. They spent ¬£155m in transfer fees while he was in charge, ¬£71m in the summer before the 2019-20 season. In September they were knocked out from the EFL Cup losing 4-0 to Oxford United of League One. He was sacked by the club on 28 December 2019 after a 2‚Äì1 home loss to Leicester City, their fourth straight home defeat, with the club in 17th place and having won only five league games all season. His time at West Ham saw a win rate of 38.98% of all games played. =David Moyes= Moyes returned as West Ham manager on 29 December 2019, signing an 18-month contract.

It originally aired on NBC on October 20, 1995. The episode was written by Julie Martin (from a story by Tom Fontana and Henry Bromell) and was directed by Tim Hunter. The two-part story centres on Pembleton and Bayliss' investigation into a pair of arson-related homicides, and introduces a new regular character, Arson Squad detective Mike Kellerman (played by Reed Diamond), who subsequently transfers to Homicide and partners with Det. Meldrick Lewis. This episode also flagged the permanent departure of regular characters Stanley Bolander (Ned Beatty) and Beau Felton (Daniel Baldwin).  Plot summary  As the episode opens, Kay Howard and Munch are on the station house rooftop, discussing recent events at a police convention in New York, where Bolander and Felton were among a group of 100 drunken police who ran amok at their hotel, and that this misconduct has earned them a 22-week suspension. As they talk, Howard notices a fire in the distance and they argue over its exact location. The action then cuts to the fire (in an abandoned box warehouse) where fire-fighters discover a charred body and summon the Homicide Squad. Pembleton and Bayliss arrive to investigate the death, and meet Arson Squad detective Mike Kellerman. He and Pembleton clash over Kellerman's assumptions about the victim's identity and manner of death. Believing the arson was for financial reasons, Kellerman meets an informant the next morning and pressures him to provide the name of the arsonist. Pembleton and Bayliss go to the pathologist for the post-mortem results, only to find that Kellerman has been there ahead of them. Hoping to link the dead boy to missing persons records, Pembleton visits Missing Persons, where he encounters his nemesis, Det. Roger Gaffney. At the station house, Howard and Munch both declare that they will sit for the Sergeant's exam in hopes of gaining a promotion and the squad begins to stake odds on the outcome. Capt. Russert and Col. Barnfather discuss the problems in the squad. Barnfather pressures Russert to improve the squad's cleanup rate, hinting that he might replace Giardello for being unable to control his detectives, and that he will hold Russert responsible for Giardello's \\"screw-ups\\". Kellerman visits the squad room to discuss the case with Bayliss and Pembleton, telling them he believes the building's owner, Matthew Rowland, is responsible for the recent fire, and for several other arson attacks on properties Rowland owns. While they are arguing, Lewis informs the detectives that uniformed officers guarding the crime scene have apprehended a teenage girl, Lisa Denardi, who was found poking around in the ruined building. When questioned, she reveals that she and her boyfriend regularly met there at night to have sex, and that they kept a sleeping bag there; from her evidence, the detectives conclude that the body is that of Lisa's 16-year-old boyfriend, Mark Landry. Kellerman visits a woman claiming to have information about the fire, but when he enters her house she strips naked and tries to seduce him so Kellerman hurriedly leaves. Bayliss visits the lab, where he meets up with Kellerman, who explains that tests show that the fire was started with gasoline. Coincidentally, back at the station house, Pembleton receives an anonymous phone tipoff about the location of the gas can supposedly used to start the fire. The mystery informant, whom we only partially see, declares that it \\"sucks\\" that the boy has been killed in the fire; his information leads Pembleton to the gas can. Meanwhile, Bayliss and Kellerman visit the building's owner, Rowland, and confront him about the arson attacks, but an infuriated Rowland phones contacts at City Hall, and as a result of his pressure, Russert meets Kellerman to explain that Rowland was actually in negotiation to sell the building to the city, and she orders Kellerman to leave Rowland alone. Fingerprint evidence on the gas can leads to a man called Calvin Jones, so Pembleton and Bayliss go to question him. When Jones tries to flee, Pembleton freezes, but he soon recovers and helps Bayliss catch Jones, who eventually proves to be a serial 'confessor' with no real connection to the crime. After the arrest, Bayliss expresses concern about Frank's state of mind (alluding to Frank's recent ordeal at the hands of the stalker) and Pembleton reveals that his wife is pregnant. At Giardello's insistence, Pembleton canvasses Landry's high school, but he draws a blank, with all information indicating that the dead boy was a 'regular' kid with no enemies. Bayliss reveals that the girl's father (who had been a suspect) also has an alibi. Kellerman offers a tentative theory that the arsonist might be someone obsessed with fire. Russert visits Giardello's office to ask about the progress of the investigation. They begin to discuss the staffing problems stemming from the suspension of Bolander and Felton, and Giardello reveals that Russert's affair with Felton is common knowledge in the squad. They begin to argue, but they are interrupted by news of another arson attack. When Pembleton, Bayliss and Kellerman arrive at the scene, they are told that a body has been spotted inside the burning building, and Kellerman admits that Pembleton's theory about Landry's death may have been right.  Production   Cultural references  When the mystery informant calls Pembleton with the tipoff about the fire, he turns up the volume of his car radio, which is playing the Jimi Hendrix version of the Bob Dylan song \\"All Along The Watchtower\\", and this music carries through the subsequent sequence.

Ismael is a Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University and a member of the Foundational Questions Institute (FQXi.) Ismael has been described by John Perry as a leading philosopher of her generation, and her work has been influential in the scholarship of metaphysics and the philosophy of physics. Education and career Ismael earned her M.A. and PhD from Princeton University in 1994 and 1997, where her dissertation advisor was Bas van Fraassen. In 1996, she was awarded a two-year Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship. In 2003, she was awarded an NEH Research fellowship at the National Humanities Center. Ismael worked at Stanford University from 1996 to 1998, and at University of Arizona from 1998 to the present, taking a 5-year leave from 2005‚Äì2010 to be a senior research associate at the Centre for Time at the University of Sydney after the Australian Research Council awarded her a five-year-long Queen Elizabeth II research fellowship. In 2011 Ismael was awarded a Big Questions in Free Will Grant from the Templeton Foundation. In 2012 she was awarded a Scholarly Conversation Grant from the National Humanities Center. Philosophical work Ismael's research focuses on the philosophy of physics and metaphysics, especially areas involving the structure of space and time, quantum mechanics, and the foundations of physical laws. She has also published on such issues as the conflict between lived experience and physics, the implications of physics on issues of freedom, death, the nature of the self, and the problem of free will. Ismael has published three books, Essays on Symmetry in 2001, The Situated Self in 2007 (with a second edition released in 2009,) and How Physics Makes Us Free in 2016, as well as a number of peer-reviewed papers. =Essays on Symmetry (2001)= In Essays on Symmetry Ismael aims to draw connections between the concept of symmetry as it is used in philosophy and the concept of symmetry as it is used in physics. =The Situated Self (2007)= In The Situated Self, Ismael presents a naturalistic account of the self, focusing on the construction of internal models that represent the external world, and attempting to explain the relationship between the self and the outside world. The book has three distinct parts: the first part deals primarily with reflexive representation and its uses, the second part applies the idea of reflexive representation to famous problems of the philosophy of mind, and the third attempts to lay out a new conception of what the self is. =Causation, Free Will and Naturalism (paper 2012)= In this paper, pdf Ismael addresses the question of free will from a physics perspective, reconciling the \\"happy confidence in one's own powers to bring things about\\" and \\"recent developments in the scientific understanding of causal concepts.\\" From the broad scientific perspective, dynamical laws seem to preclude not only most folk notions of free will, but the very concept of causality in general. However \\"interventionist account\\" of causality, independently developed by Clark Glymour and Judea Pearl, makes sense of considering the impacts of our human behavior on the system. \\"We need causal information to decide how to act...\\" =How Physics Makes Us Free (2016)= Her book How Physics Makes Us Free was selected by John Farrell of Forbes Magazine as 2016 Book of the Year.Book Of The Year: How Physics Makes Us Free Dec 31, 2016 References Category:American women philosophers Category:Metaphysicians Category:Princeton University alumni Category:University of Arizona faculty Category:Columbia University faculty Category:Philosophy of physics Category:21st-century American philosophers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Jenann Ismael"},{"id":"40291526","text":"Qeshlaq-e Melli () may refer to: *Qeshlaq-e Melli Hajji Hamat *Qeshlaq-e Melli Hoseyn Qoli *Qeshlaq-e Melli Mahmudlar ","title":"Qeshlaq-e Melli"},{"id":"40291529","text":"Qeshlaq-e Qarah Kakil () may refer to: *Qeshlaq-e Qarah Kakil Ayaz *Qeshlaq-e Qarah Kakil Hajji Mahmud *Qeshlaq-e Qarah Kakil Matleb ","title":"Qeshlaq-e Qarah Kakil"},{"id":"40291545","text":"Qeshlaq-e Qarah Kakil Hajji Mahmud (, also Romanized as QeshlƒÅq-e Qarah Kakƒ´l ·∏®ƒÅjjƒ´ Ma·∏©m≈´d) is a village in Qeshlaq-e Jonubi Rural District, Qeshlaq Dasht District, Bileh Savar County, Ardabil Province, Iran.

It is often describes as Minang version of nasi ramas or nasi campur (mixed rice). A nasi kapau foodstall usually consists of stages and rows of large bowls, plates or saucepans filled with various dishes. In nasi kapau food stalls, after the customer is seated, they are asked which dishes they desire. The waiter then prepared steaming hot rice on plate with cubadak (unripe jackfruit gulai), and boiled cassava leaf, and sambal aside. The chosen dishes will be put directly ‚Äî using long serving spoon ‚Äî upon the steamed rice or in separate small plates. Nasi kapau eating establishments usually insist on using high quality fragrant rice. High quality Kapau rice directly brought from Bukittinggi and Agam Regency. In Minang food establishments, it is common to eat with one's hands. They usually provide kobokan, a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent. This water is used to wash one's hands before and after eating. If a customer does not wish to eat with bare hands, it is acceptable to ask for a spoon and fork. Dishes Various types of gulais offered in nasi kapau food stall, Agam Regency, West Sumatra, Indonesia. Nasi kapau dishes are actually quite similar or almost identical with nasi padang from Padang city. The differences mainly lies in the method of serving, and sometimes there are some typical Kapau Bukittinggi dishes that seldom served in common Padang restaurant. The dishes offered in nasi kapau are: * Rendang, chunks of beef stewed in spicy coconut milk and chili gravy, cooked well until dried. Other than beef, rendang ayam (chicken rendang) and rendang itik (duck rendang) can be found. * Daun ubi tumbuk, cassava leaves in coconut milk * Kalio, similar to rendang; while rendang is rather dry, kalio is watery and light-colored * Gulai ayam, chicken gulai * Gulai cancang, gulai of meats and cow internal organs * Gulai tunjang, gulai of cow foot tendons * Gulai babek, gulai babat or gulai paruik kabau, gulai of cow tripes * Gulai iso or gulai usus, gulai of cow intestines usually filled with eggs and tofu * Gulai impo, gulai of cow spleen * Gulai ati, gulai of cow liver * Gulai otak, gulai of cow brain * Gulai sumsum, gulai of cow bone marrow * Gulai gajeboh, cow fat gulai * Gulai itiak, duck gulai * Gulai talua, boiled eggs gulai * Gulai kepala ikan kakap merah, red snapper's head gulai * Gulai jariang, jengkol stinky bean gulai * Dendeng batokok, thin crispy beef * Dendeng balado, thin crispy beef with chili * Paru goreng, fried cow lung * Ayam bakar, grilled spicy chicken * Ayam goreng, fried chicken with spicy granules * Ayam pop, Minang style chicken, boiled/steamed and later fried.

Environmental issues Prolonged drought in southwestern Oklahoma during 2011 - 12 has caused serious harm to the lake. Water conservation steps, including severe restrictions on lawn watering and higher customer fees, have been implemented by the cities who consume the lake water. Evaporation losses have been high, and there are concerns about the increased rate of silting. Drought conditions are also conducive to the formation of harmful algae. =2011 Algae bloom= During August 2011, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality found high concentrations of blue-green algae in lake water samples and banned human contact with untreated lake water. This algae contains toxins that are very hazardous to humans. In response, the Corps of Engineers shut down the two swimming beaches there. By late December algae concentrations had dropped sufficiently to lift the ban, although the agencies were still discouraging water contact.Hopper, Toni. \\"Blue green algae levels drop at Waurika Lake.\\" The Duncan Banner.

Water officials have called for mandatory 10 percent reductions in the supply to users as one way to extend the life of the system. Dredging the sediment is also being considered. Removing the accumulated material is expected to cost between $2.5 and $6 million. The dredging project could begin in 2014, but funding must be found first. Officials also pointed out that the current low levels of lake water present additional safety hazards for lake users. Low levels are exposing old trees, bridge piers and other obstacles. The water has low visibility and there are a lot of dropoffs in the bottom.

It originally aired on NBC on October 27, 1995. Both parts were written by Julie Martin (from a story by Tom Fontana and Henry Bromell); Part 1 was directed by Tim Hunter, and Part 2 by Nick Gomez. This episode concludes the investigation of a pair of arson-related homicides, led by detectives Pembleton and Bayliss, with their Arson Squad colleague Det. Mike Kellerman.  Plot summary  Soon after the warehouse fire that has killed a teenage boy, another body is found at the scene of a second suspicious fire. The three detectives examine the charred, skeletal remains of the second victim, a young woman. Kellerman deduces that this fire has also been deliberately lit, using gasoline-soaked \\"trailers\\" (probably made from toilet paper) and from his observation of the body he theorises that the victim was probably killed elsewhere before the building was set alight. Post-mortem examination reveals that the girl was around 15, and confirms Kellerman's theory that she was probably killed before the fire, by a blow to the head with a hammer. Dental records soon match with a Missing Persons report for a local girl, Bonnie Nash. While Howard and Munch vie with each other over the upcoming sergeant's exam, Bayliss and Pembleton discuss the duty of informing members of the public about the death of loved ones, on their way to speak to the girl's family. At a bar, Kellerman meets up with his ex-wife, pathologist Dr Anne Kennedy (Stephanie Romanoff) and they bicker about their break-up and Anne chides Mike for his unwillingness to take risks. The next morning he meets his informant, who tells him the two fires were \\"profit jobs\\"; he goes on to tell Kellerman that a friend has told him about a man in a blue van who visited the gas station where she works on the night of the second fire, that the man had bought a container of gasoline (and, as she subsequently discovers) that he had stolen 6 rolls of toilet paper. The informant also tells Kellerman that the man had told his friend, in passing, that he was \\"a chemist\\". Kellerman tells Giardello about the new lead, and Giardello insists that Pembleton and Kellerman must work together to solve the case. Pembleton appears on TV to appeal for witnesses to the two fires. When he returns to the squad room, Kellerman complains that his \\"chemist\\" lead has turned up nothing, but then Pembleton receives another phone call from his anonymous informant. The mystery man tells Frank that he was at the scene of the second fire and that he saw the arsonist drive away in a blue van, but he refuses to give any other information. When the caller hangs up, Kellerman confirms that they have been able to trace the call. They go to the address, but when the householder returns, they discover that the home has been broken into and ransacked, presumably by the mystery informant. Russert delights Giardello by telling him that she has secured Barnfather's promise that he will approve the appointment of a new squad member, but the condition is that the squad must clear up the arson murders. With their leads proving fruitless, Giardello orders the team to start the investigation over, so they return to the scene of the first fire. Entering the precinct of the abandoned building, Frank pays for information from a vagrant, who directs them to a homeless old woman, Mrs Rosen. She vacantly tells him that a young man, whom she calls \\"Mr Rob\\", had taken her for a ride in his blue van on the night of the fire. Frustrated, the detectives argue with each other over their inability to crack the case, but then Bayliss scores a breakthrough, finding a match for the elusive blue van in vehicular records, and they bring in the registered owner, Gavin Robb, a young chemistry teacher at a local high school. Under questioning, Robb protests his innocence, explaining that his connection to Mrs Rosen is because he often drives around at night helping homeless people, but he is also forced to admit that Bonnie Nash had been a student in his class the previous year. Pembleton and Bayliss leave the interrogation room, joining Giardello to observe as Kellerman as he interviews Robb alone. They wager that Kellerman will fail and Robb will go free, but Kellerman sets a subtle trap - knowing that the suspect is a dog owner, he tells Robb that a dog had been found burned to death in the second fire. After more questioning, Kellerman appears to give up, and he ends the interview, but as he goes to leave, he springs his trap, casually asking Robb why he had killed the dog. Caught offguard, Robb inadvertently replies, \\"I didn't know it was there\\", effectively admitting he had been at the warehouse on the night of the Nash's murder, and he then confesses to the girl's slaying. After the confession, Kellerman reveals that he had tricked Robb because there was no dead dog. Impressed by Kellerman's breakthrough, Giardello offers him the place in the Homicide squad. Mike initially turns it down, worried that he is not up to the challenge, but after visiting his father at his dead-end job on production line of a local distillery, he returns to the station house to accept Giardello's offer. On the rooftop, Pembleton admits to Bayliss that he is frightened by the prospect of bringing a child into such a dangerous world.  Production   Cultural references   References  1\\\\.

Early life and junior football Grundy was born in Adelaide, South Australia and attended Cabra Dominican College, a private Catholic high school in the southern suburbs of the city, graduating in 2011. A former basketball player, Grundy switched to Australian rules football in 2010. Brodie has a younger brother, Riley, who was drafted to Port Adelaide with pick 73 in the 2018 draft. AFL career Following a successful season playing as a ruckman with South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Sturt's junior teams, Grundy was recruited by Collingwood with draft pick #18 in the 2012 AFL Draft. Grundy was the Round 22 nomination for the 2013 AFL Rising Star award. In March 2014, Grundy signed a three-year contract extension lasting until the end of the 2017 AFL season. In 2018 he won the Herald Sun Player of the Year award with 27 votes, one clear of ruck Max Gawn and midfielder Tom Mitchell. Grundy also won the Copeland medal for Collingwood's best and fairest in 2018, drawing with Steele Sidebottom. Playing style Despite playing as ruckman, Grundy is able to follow up his ruckwork and win the ball himself and apply tackles. He has been labelled as a ‚Äòfourth midfielder‚Äô by his teammates. In the 2018 season, he averaged 20.2 disposals per match; 525 for the season (48th in the AFL), easily the highest amongst ruckmen.
