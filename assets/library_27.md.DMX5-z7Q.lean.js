Geographic extent Traditionally, Awori are found in Ogun State and Lagos State, Nigeria. Towns including Isheri, Ota, Igbesa, Agbara, Ilobi, Tigbo are all Awori settlements within today's Ogun State (created 1976) in Nigeria. Origin story The story is that Olofin (or Ogunfunminire, founder of the Awori) and his followers left the palace of King Oduduwa (founder of the Yoruba) in Ile-Ife and migrated southward along a river. Oduduwa had given Olofin a mud plate and instructed him to place it on the water and follow it until it sank into the river. Several days after leaving Ile-Ife, the plate suddenly stopped near Olokemeji near present-day Abeokuta. After seventeen days, it began moving again, only to stop at Oke-Ata for another seventeen days. At the end of seventeen days, the plate began moving again, only to stop again on the southern outskirts of present-day Abeokuta, where it stayed for another seventeen days. At this location, some of Olofin's followers decided to remain, led by a man named Osho Aro-bi-ologbo-egan. The plate continued downriver, stopping again at Isheri, where it remained for a much longer period of time. Olofin began instructing his followers to begin setting up a permanent settlement, but after 289 days (17 x 17) the plate began moving again. Olofin and a few followers followed the plate, while the rest of the group stayed behind. After two days the plate stopped briefly at Iddo in Lagos. At Idumota in central Lagos, it whirled around in the water and sank to the bottom. When Olofin returned to his group at Iddo, they are said to have asked him where the plate was. He answered \\"Awo Ti Ri\\" meaning \\"The plate has sunk\\". This is how the name Awori is said to have come into being. In accordance with Yoruba custom, they brought their crown along with them from Ile Ife. Osolo, one of the sons of Prince Olofin, settled at the Osi quarters as his father and his brother journeyed further south from the place where the plate sank at Idumota. The first crowned Oba (king) or Olota of Ota at Ota, Ogun was Oba Akinsewa Ogbolu in 1621, he was the son of Osolo. History The settlement of the Awori clan is known to have preceded the establishment of Abeokuta as an Egba kingdom in 1832, as Isheri, the foremost Awori town within present day Ogun State was settled in the 15th century. Traditions are consistent about the presence of a distinct Yoruba sub-group around Lagos by about 1550 when the Benin Empire invaded the region of Lagos. An anthropologist, W.G. Wormalin in his Intelligence Report on the Badagry district of the colony (1935) gives a graphic description of the early Awori he encountered when he writes that:\\" They speak a slurred dialect of the Yoruba language. They mostly engage in farming and fishing.\\" Religion Traditional beliefs and practice exist side-by-side Islam and Christianity. Some of the Awori combined Islam or Christianity with their traditional beliefs and practices. Islam was introduced to different parts of Aworiland before the twentieth century by Muslim clerics from the hinterland, while the diffusion of Christianity followed missionary activities in the region of Badagry from the 1840s. The use of Ifa oracle in the determination of certain issues and events such as date of festival, coronation ceremony, causes of state calamity is in practice among traditional believers. Individual's future ad fortune remained an important aspect of Yoruba civilisation, which the Awori still retain. In addition, the institutions of priesthood and palace society for which the Yoruba of the interior are famous featured prominently between them. For instance, the possession of Ade crown and recognition of Oba, which is the highest conception of political authority among the Yoruba, is what every tradition leader; especially those from royal lineages in Aworiland aspire to. Traditional Festival Oro and Oree, Egungun, Elegba, igumuko,Opa, Osugbo and Gelede festivals among the traditional Awori communities are celebrated as people celebrate modern Sallah and Christmas with indigenes trooping back home from far and near when dates are fixed. Economy Due to the nature of the geographical environment, fishing, rather than farming which is traditionally with the Yoruba, is the major traditional preoccupation of the seaside. Awori are also great farmers. In some regions, fishing is combined with mat and basket production and palm oil. The climatic variation north of the coast offers an opportunity for the cultivation of a variety of crops. Cassava is probably the most widely cultivated as it could be planted and harvested throughout the year. In addition, it is a source of Garri, which now constitute a major staple food. Cassava is also processed for the production of starch and a locally produced starchy food known as Fufu and other confectionaries. Maize, Yams, Cocoyams and Oil Palm are also popular crops produced in the region. The food crops are supplemented by vegetables as well as animals such as goats, sheep and rabbits; birds like quail, cock, hen and goose, edible insects such as termites as well as alligators, which are prepared as a delicacy known as '√ín√¨' among the Aworis of Lagos State. However, with the industrial revolution pioneered by the Obafemi Awolowo government in the late 1950s and 1960s, the Awori-speaking areas like Ikeja and Isolo in Lagos, as well as Otta and Agbara began to see a concentration of industries, for which the indigenes surrendered their land for the economic transformation of their communities.

It formed in the early morning hours of August 8, 2007, skipping along an approximately -long path, from Staten Island across The Narrows to Brooklyn. The worst damage was in and around Sunset Park and Bay Ridge, in Brooklyn. The U.S. National Weather Service estimated its strength there as an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. No serious injuries or fatalities were reported as a result of the tornado, but several people were treated at area hospitals for flying glass injuries. At least 40 buildings and 100 cars were damaged. New York State Senator Martin Golden‚Äôs office estimated damages in the tens of millions of U.S. dollars. The storm system produced severe street flooding, and disrupted all modes of transportation throughout the city. Service was delayed or suspended on all 24 New York City Subway services during the morning rush hour, and nine services were still not running by the evening rush. Timeline Structural damage caused by the tornado.The typical summer storm system that spawned the tornado gathered strength over Pennsylvania, caused heavy rain over New Jersey and continued its eastward movement, reaching New York City at sunrise. According to the National Weather Service, the first tornado first touched down in Staten Island at approximately 6:22 am EDT (1022 UTC) in the vicinity of St. Austins Place in the Livingston - Randall Manor area, before moving east, with additional damage occurring in the Tompkinsville area, probably from a subsequent tornado that formed from a new area of circulation just north of the first tornado. Most of the damage on Staten Island was to trees, and was rated EF1 intensity with estimated winds of . The circulation intensified, and headed east across The Narrows tidal strait, just north of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and the tornado re-developed and touched down again in Brooklyn, at Bay Ridge at 6:32 am EDT. It continued on an east-northeast path across 68th Street between Third and Fourth Avenues, damaging the roofs of 11 homes. The storm continued to move east-northeast into Leif Ericson Park Square, where severe damage to trees occurred, and where winds blew out a stained glass window valued at $300,000 at the nearby Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church.Church shattered by lost window ‚Äì New York Daily News ‚Äì August 8, 2007 It then crossed the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. The tornado touched down farther northeast with scattered tree damage along Sixth Avenue. Based on the assessed damage this stage of the tornado was classified EF2 with wind speeds of 111 to 135 mph (161 to 215 km/h). The tornado returned to the ground with another pocket of significant damage on 58th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. Roofs were ripped off of 5 homes, with tree damage indicating strong EF1 damage. The tornado then headed east and touched down again in Kensington and the Flatbush neighborhood of Prospect Park South at approximately 6:40 am EDT. Approximately 30 trees were uprooted along Ocean Parkway. The National Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for portions of Staten Island and Brooklyn at 6:28 am. Tornado warnings were also briefly issued for eastern Brooklyn and Southern Queens and Nassau County on Long Island, but no tornadoes were reported in those areas. Media coverage New York Post front page on August 9 New York Daily News front page on August 9 New York media coverage of the event focused on the novelty of the event and its disruption of subway service (this was the third time in 2007 when heavy rain had caused disruptions in subway service). Tabloids The New York Post and New York Daily News tabloids both ran the front-page headline ‚ÄúTwister!‚Äù The main article in the Daily News was headlined ‚ÄúBrooklyn becomes Tornado Alley!‚Äù with a subheading of ‚ÄúFirst twister to rip through boro since 1889; S.I. driver dies‚Äù. The main article inside the Post read: ‚ÄúBrooklyn Cyclone‚Äù (playing on the pun of the famous Coney Island Cyclone in Brooklyn and the baseball team of the same name). The teaser on the front page depicted Dorothy Gale from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz proclaiming ‚ÄúThis ain't Kansas‚Äù. An inside side bar in the Post had eyewitness accounts headlined ‚ÄúWet & Wild‚Äù. The Long Island based Newsday front-page headline was \\"What‚Äôs Up With the Weather? ‚Äì LI Drenched Again ‚Äì Tornado in City ‚Äì Subways Swamped.\\" Broadsheets The New York Times front page main headline was ‚ÄúSubways to Rooftops, a Storm Brings Havoc to New York‚Äù The three front-page stories were headlined ‚ÄúTransportation Paralysis‚Äù, \\"D√©j√† vu Down Under\\", \\"Yes a Tornado in Brooklyn.\\" The New York Times quoted an eyewitness, who said, \\"It was a funnel shape...It looked kind of black and blue...it was way up high and came right down on the roof of (a department store)...Pieces of the roof were all over the place.

Global warming The press coverage also examined the link between the storm and global warming, given the tornado's historic nature, and the other recent subway service interruptions caused by torrential rain on July 18 and the previous winter. Official statements alluded to this as well. \\"We may be dealing with meteorological conditions that are unprecedented,\\" said Metropolitan Transportation Authority Executive Director Elliot G. Sander in the immediate aftermath, and New York Governor Eliot Spitzer said the day after, \\"This is supposed to be a rainfall event that is a once-in-a-decade occurrence -- we've had three in the past seven months.\\" Climate scientist James E. Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University in New York City cautioned against linking any single event with global warming, but did say that the probability of severe weather events is related. \\"You cannot blame a single specific event, such as this week's storm, on climate change. However, it is fair to ask whether the human changes have altered the likelihood of such events. There the answer seems to be 'yes.'\\", he was quoted as saying.

He is known for producing and starring in low-budget TV ads for local businesses in the Twin Cities and markets across the U.S., including a Taco Bell ad aired during the 2016 Super Bowl that played off his status as a \\"local legend.\\" Rarely breaking character on stage or off, Fancy Ray is a buoyantly self- aggrandizing, larger-than-life personality given to spontaneous poetry (about himself) and mock-boastful proclamations including his oft-repeated characteristic catchphrase \\"I'm the best-lookin‚Äô man in comedy.\\" In 2020, he released the career-retrospective stand-up album The Best Lookin' Man in Comedy on Stand Up!

Writer/producer Diablo Cody, who wrote the liner notes for the album, calls Fancy Ray a \\"subversive\\" and \\"bombastic character (who) looms large in the collective psyche of the Twin Cities ... a nontraditional, nonconformist guy\\" whose \\"shtick is almost like a spell.\\" Early life  The youngest of four boys from north Minneapolis, McCloney attended Central, Marshall-University and West high schools, graduating from West. As a second-grader, Ray did a ventriloquist act with Rev. Billy Graham's traveling show. His nickname came from his grandfather, William M.L. \\"Fancy\\" Wade, a sharp-dressed ladies' man and professional athlete who also introduced McCloney to the music and style of Little Richard, a major influence. Career=Stand-up comedy McCloney's career began in 1984 when he won a lip-sync contest at Minneapolis' First Avenue nightclub impersonating Little Richard, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, and James Brown. This led to spots on the nationally syndicated lip-sync TV show Puttin' on the Hits. He began performing stand-up in 1989, performing locally and opening for Richard Pryor, Little Richard and Chris Rock. Fancy Ray's comic persona includes a flamboyant sexual ambiguity and style of dress, and a theatrical mock-arrogance and vanity once described as \\"a cross between Little Richard and Ethel Merman\\" and a \\"carefully crafted ... naughty alter ego with goofy, winking innocence\\" that gives him the \\"ability to soften life‚Äôs seedier edges with campy joie de vivre.\\" His penchant for bombastic nicknames also includes the \\"Human Chocolate Orchid.\\" He has sometimes been disparaged for merely being \\"famous for being famous,\\" which he acknowledges with the joke \\"\\"I'm like Paris [Hilton] with a pretty tan.\\" Get Down With It Also in 1989, McCloney debuted a talk show, Get Down With It, on local cable-access Minneapolis Television Network. The show cemented his status as a local celebrity in the Twin Cities, interviewing guests including Ron Jeremy, Bootsy Collins, Whoopi Goldberg, Al Green, Bo Diddley, George Clinton, Carol Channing, Kevin Garnett, and Gloria Steinem. Though focusing on comedy, the show also had a serious side; McCloney interviewed white supremacists during the Los Angeles riots, as well as civil rights activist Spike Moss and (in his final interview) HIV- positive Minneapolis City Council member Brian Coyle. A reviewer for the St. Cloud Times noted that despite his reputation for outrageous self-promotion, \\"Fancy Ray's true calling is as an interviewer. He's sensitive, prepared and interested in what other people have to say.\\" Television advertising McCloney runs a one-man ad agency, Chocolate Orchid Productions, which produces, writes, edits and stars in television commercials for local businesses in the Twin Cities and other markets including San Jose; Phoenix; Memphis; St. Louis, Missouri; and Jacksonville, Florida. He also appeared in a Taco Bell ad aired during the 2016 Super Bowl that played off his status as a \\"local legend.\\" Political career In 1998, he ran for governor of Minnesota on the third-party People's Champion ticket, stating that \\"the whole election was a joke so why not have me, a professional comedian?\\" Beyond novelty value, he also wanted to be a spokesman for issues affecting blacks and poor people. His running mate was his mother, Toni McCloney. He received 919 votes, losing to Jesse Ventura.

Each unit consists of one or more inclined runways. Merchandise is loaded in the rear of each runway. As an item is removed from the front, the item directly behind it slides forward in place of the previous. The main advantage of carton flow rack over static rack or shelving systems is that merchandise remains better organized and easier to find or pick. With carton flow rack, the product is automatically rotated on a first- in, first-out basis. Merchandise is stocked in the rear of the carton flow rack and moves toward the picking station in front on an inclined shelf equipped with specially designed roller track. When a carton is removed from the picking station, the next one in line rolls to the front. Carton flow always keeps items within reach. Inventory is easier to monitor and control since products are fully visible at all times. A limitation worth mentioning is that carton flows are not well suited for larger volume or full case applications. Carton Flow Restocking and picking typically offer the greatest opportunity for improving efficiency within order-picking operations. With carton flow rack systems, labor savings of up to 75% can be realized almost immediately. Because items are picked from the front and stocked from the rear, both functions can be performed without interference and with minimized travel. In a static storage system such as standard shelving, stockers and pickers often do a lot of unnecessary travel.  History  Lansing Peter Shield, President of Grand Union Co., applied for patents for the original gravity-feed rear-load design using Unistrut and Nylon strips in 1945 (later approved in 1948). The unit consisted of several inclined runways. The device was driven by gravity. A stockman would place merchandise in the rear of each runway and, as a shopper selected an item, the item behind it would slide forward in place of the previous one. Grand Union formed a company called Food-O-Mat to sell the carton flow system, and made Gardner Hinckley the president. Gauer Metal Products, Inc manufactured the carton flow units for Grand Union/Food-O-Mat. When Lansing Shield died of a heart attack, Thomas Butler was appointed the new president. Butler had no interest in continuing to use carton flow units in Grand Union supermarkets, so Food-O-Mat went off on its own to sell the product with Gauer Metal Products as its manufacturer.  Carton flow today  The carton flow design has gone through countless changes over the years, and has now evolved to full shelving units. These units consist of polyethylene or aluminum roller runways and can be stand- alone racks or can be installed into pallet racks. Conveyor systems are sometimes used as an alternative option to carton flow shelving.

However she struggled at a reading of the script and the role was given to Megan Williams instead. Then there was a delay in financing which put the film back a year. Dobrowolska improved her English and impressed the director and producer in a play she was appearing in; Williams was let go and Dobrowolska was cast.

He gave the American public a firsthand account of Mafia activities in the United States.Killers in Prison, Time, October 4, 1963\\"The Smell of It\\", Time, October 11, 1963 Valachi had agreed to testify against the mafia and expose its dark past after landing in prison for a heroin charge alongside his boss, Don Vito Genovese. Fueled by anger at his former organization and a fear for his life after receiving the kiss of death from Genovese, Valachi reached out to testify, knowing the only other likely option was death. A low-ranking member of the New York-based Genovese crime family, Valachi was the first ever government witness to come forward from the American Mafia itself. Before Valachi, federal authorities had no concrete evidence that the American Mafia even existed. His disclosures did not lead directly to the prosecution of many high-ranking Mafia leaders, but he was able to provide many details of its history, structure, operations and rituals, as well as naming many active and former members of the major crime families. Valachi testified in vivid and minute detail on his day-to-day life in organized crime in a first-time-ever public account of life as a soldier of La Cosa Nostra, including its rites of initiation.Maas, The Valachi Papers, p. 18 These televised hearings brought home to average Americans the violence and intimidation routinely used by the Mafia to further and protect its criminal enterprises.International Drug Trafficking: Law Enforcement Challenges for the Next Century by Thomas A. Constantine; Administrator, United States Drug Enforcement Administration Disclosures Much of the knowledge accessible to the public today about the American Mafia was first disclosed in Joseph Valachi's televised testimony. The organizational structure of Cosa Nostra in accordance with Valachi's testimony. Valachi disclosed that the Mafia was called Cosa Nostra (\\"our thing\\" or \\"this thing of ours\\" in Italian) among the members of the organization and that the term \\"Mafia\\" was an outsider term.Their Thing, Time, 16 August 1963 At the time, Cosa Nostra was understood as a proper name, fostered by the FBI and disseminated by the media. The designation gained wide popularity and almost replaced the term Mafia. (in Italy, the article la precedes the general \\"mafia\\" term but is not used before \\"Cosa Nostra\\").The term was often prefixed with ‚ÄúLa‚Äù (La Cosa Nostra), in the media and even in the FBI, but this is inconsistent with the Italian language as well as Valachi‚Äôs testimony. He also revealed the organizational structure of the Mafia. Valachi revealed that \\"soldiers\\" are organized into \\"regimes\\" and led by a \\"caporegime\\" (\\"lieutenant\\"). The regimes, in turn, are organized into \\"families\\" and bossed by \\"capos\\" (bosses), each representing a geographic area, who make up Cosa Nostra's Commission, the final arbiter of the syndicate's affairs, and who act as a sort of Cosa Nostra Executive Board.Maas, The Valachi Papers, p. 32 While revealing the existence of these syndicates and that they were referred to as \\"families,\\" he also disclosed the names of New York City's Five Families. According to Valachi, the original bosses of the Five Families were Charles Luciano, Tommaso Gagliano, Joseph Profaci, Salvatore Maranzano and Vincent Mangano. At the time of his testimony in 1963, Valachi revealed that the current bosses of the Five Families were Tommy Lucchese, Vito Genovese, Joseph Colombo, Carlo Gambino, and Joe Bonanno. These have since been the names most commonly used to refer to the New York Five Families, despite years of overturn and changing bosses in each. Aftermath The assassination of President Kennedy one month after the hearings took a lot of steam out of RFK's war on the Mafia. However, later, due in part to Valachi's disclosures, the United States Congress eventually passed two new laws to strengthen federal racketeering and gambling statutes to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation's fight against mob influence. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 provided for the use of court-ordered electronic surveillance in the investigation of certain specified violations. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Statute of 1970 allowed organized groups to be prosecuted for all of their diverse criminal activities, without the crimes being linked by a perpetrator or all-encompassing conspiracy. Along with greater use of Agents for undercover work by the late 1970s, these provisions helped the FBI develop cases that, in the 1980s, put almost all the major traditional crime family heads in prison. The Valachi Papers In 1964 the US Department of Justice urged Valachi to write down his personal history of his underworld career. Although Valachi was only expected to fill in the gaps in his formal questioning, the resulting account of his thirty-year criminal career was a rambling 1,180-page manuscript titled The Real Thing.Books: His Life and Crimes, Time, January 17, 1969The Valachi Papers, Censorship (accessed March 6, 2011)Peter Maas, Encyclopedia of World Biography (accessed March 6, 2011) Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach authorized the public release of Valachi‚Äôs manuscript. He hoped that publication of Valachi‚Äôs story would aid law enforcement and possibly encourage other criminal informers to step forward. Author Peter Maas, who broke Valachi‚Äôs story in The Saturday Evening Post, was assigned the job of editing the manuscript and permitted to interview Valachi in his Washington, D.C., jail cell. The American Italian Anti-Defamation League promoted a national campaign against the book on the grounds that it would reinforce negative ethnic stereotypes. If the book‚Äôs publication was not stopped they would appeal directly to the White House. Katzenbach reversed his decision to publish the book after a meeting with President Lyndon B. Johnson, an action that embarrassed the Justice Department. In May 1966, Katzenbach asked a district court to stop Maas from publishing the book‚Äîthe first time that a U.S. attorney general had ever tried to ban a book. Maas was never permitted to publish his edition of Valachi‚Äôs original memoirs, but he was allowed to publish a third-person account based upon interviews he himself had conducted with Valachi. These formed the basis of the book The Valachi Papers, which was published in 1968. The book was made into the 1972 film The Valachi Papers starring Charles Bronson as Valachi. Francis Ford Coppola, in his director's commentary on The Godfather Part II (1974), mentioned that the scenes depicting the Senate committee interrogation of Michael Corleone and Frank Pentangeli are based on Valachi's federal hearings and that Pentangeli is like a Valachi figure.

He was born in Ongole (Andhra Pradesh).Brief biography of Bhadriraju Krishnamurti. He was Vice Chancellor of Hyderabad Central University from 1986 to 1993 and founded the Department of Linguistics at Osmania University where he served as professor from 1962 to 1986. His magnum opus The Dravidian Languages is considered a landmark volume in the study of Dravidian linguistics.R. E.

Review of: The Dravidian languages, by Bhadriraju Krishnamurti. SIL Electronic Book Reviews 2009-001: 4 Krishnamurti was a student and close associate of Murray Barnson Emeneau. He got his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in 1955 and 1957 respectively. His grandson Ravi Bhadriraju was the rhythm guitarist in death metal band Job for a Cowboy. Contribution to linguistics Krishnamurti is considered to be among the first to apply the rigour of modern comparative linguistic theory to further the study of Dravidian languages. His thesis Telugu Verbal Bases (1961) is the first comprehensive account of comparative Dravidian phonology and derivational morphology of verbal bases in Dravidian from the standpoint of Telugu. His comprehensive grammar on or K≈´bi is a monumental work in the area of non-literary Dravidian languages. His research was devoted to the central problems of phonology and morphology/syntax of Dravidian, and he made significant contributions in advancing the then nascent field of comparative and historical Dravidian studies in the second half of the twentieth century. His Comparative Dravidian Linguistics: Current Perspectives is a collection of twenty-one important articles published during the period 1955‚Äì1998, which attempts to provide solutions to many outstanding problems of Dravidian linguistics. His recent work The Dravidian Languages published by Cambridge University Press (2003) is a culmination of the scholarly research carried out by him in the last fifty years. It replaces Caldwell's one-hundred-fifty-year-old A comparative Grammar of Dravidian or South Indian Family of Languages as a comprehensive and authoritative source of reference on the Dravidian languages. After a brief service (1960‚Äì61) at the University of California, Berkeley, he returned to India and started the Department of Linguistics at Osmania University which later became the first center of Advanced Studies in Linguistics in India. He was also instrumental in conceptualizing, designing and implementing the compilation of A Telugu Dialect Dictionary of Occupational Vocabularies in Andhra Pradesh, India, and so far over a dozen volumes covering different occupations and dialects have been published.

The plot revolves around Susan's (played by Kinski) plan to kill her former husband (with the help of a group of misfits) and collect his life insurance. The film was screened at the AFI Film Festival in 1998 but due to poor audience reactions, Susan's Plan was released straight to video in 2000. Plot Susan Holland is a suburbanite woman who plots to kill her wealthy husband Paul in order to collect his life insurance policy. Though Susan's adulterous lover, Sam Meyers, she hires two incompetent criminals, named Bill and Steve, to kill Paul and make it look like a mugging gone wrong. However, when Bill and Steve show up as expected and shoot Paul outside his car in a parking lot, Paul survives and is taken to the hospital. Undaunted, Susan insists on continuing with her plans to kill Paul by having hiring a biker, named Bob, to carry out the deed while Paul is recovering in the hospital. Bob enlists a former prostitute, named Betty Johnson, to seduce Dr. Chris Stillman, the doctor treating Paul, to have the doctor move Paul to a private hospital room for Bob to isolate and kill Paul. However, Susan's plan starts to unravel when a suspicious police detective, Detective Scott, begins suspecting her of having a hand in the attempt on Paul's life, and Sam's ex- wife, Penny, learns about the plot and wants in on part of Paul's life insurance money. Both Bill and Steve continue to insist to Susan to pay them for their work anyway despite they failed to kill Paul as planned. All through the film are fantasy sequences from various characters of their fears over being caught or shot by their own accomplices as details of the plan to kill Paul begins to fall apart. Despite circumstances, Bob does manage to sneak into Paul's hospital room and kills him by smothering him with a pillow and makes a quick getaway. However, the next day, as Susan and Sam are planning to go to the police station to give their statement and pay off Bill and Steve for their work, Detective Scott and several policemen arrive and arrest all of them when security cameras at the hospital captured all of the events leading up to Paul's murder. When Bob arrives at Susan's house and the police move into arrest him, he attempts to run and opens fire at the policemen, but gets shot and killed trying to escape. Steve is shot and killed by a stray bullet in the crossfire. Susan is taken away to jail, while Sam's ex-wife Penny is also arrested due to her knowledge of the plot. Only Betty manages to slip away. In the final scene, with Susan, Sam, Bill, and Penny all in prison serving their time, and the bodies of Bob, Steve, and Paul at the local morgue, Betty is shown to be living in Las Vegas in the free and clear and working as a casino cocktail waitress. When Dr. Stillman happens to visit the casino with his wife while on vacation, he spots and recognizes Betty working there under her new alias and knows that she had a hand in Paul's murder. But Dr. Stillman, fearing a negative reaction from his wife if she learned about his brief sexual tryst with Betty, pretends not to know who Betty is and lets her go while he continues his holiday in Vegas with his wife.

In 1953, Naka created a \\"formal upright\\" style Foeminia, during a demonstration for his bonsai class. He also acquired a taller tree (eventually to become the main, tallest tree of Goshin), which was replanted in the ground and gradually thinned and shaped; it was ready for showing by 1960.William N. Valavanis, \\"The History of Goshin (Protector of the spirit) \\", North American Bonsai Federation Newsletter #1, Feature #5 (December 2002). Accessed August 9, 2007.

Inspired by a forest of Cryptomeria japonica near a shrine in Japan, Naka first combined the four trees he had already developed into a single, composition.Gallery Museum ‚Äì Designing Bonsai. Accessed March 28, 2008. He soon added three more, to create a seven-tree forest bonsai. Naka also had to modify the pot to ensure adequate drainage‚Äîthe lack of which caused one of the trees, and its repeated replacements, to die. At the time, Naka had seven grandchildren, each of which was represented by a tree. At the urging of fellow bonsai artists, he named his composition; he called the bonsai \\"Goshin\\", meaning \\"protector of the spirit\\", in reference to the forest shrine that inspired it. By 1973, Naka had eleven grandchildren, and he augmented Goshin concordantly.

Club career  Born in Kokkola, Myntti began his career at his hometown Kokkola's top club KPV. In March 2001 he was signed as a promising youth player by the Norwegian Tippeligaen side Troms√∏ IL. Failing to secure a place in the Troms√∏ squad, he was loaned out twice during his stay at the club. In 2002, he joined FC H√§meenlinna in mid-season to make his Veikkausliiga debut. In 2003, he played the whole season at another Veikkausliiga side, FF Jaro of Jakobstad. In July 2004 his contract with Troms√∏ was terminated. After leaving Norway, Myntti returned home to play for KPV in the Finnish second tier Ykk√∂nen. After a successful spell at KPV, he was signed by the defending Finnish champions Tampere United for the 2007 season. He won the league title with Tampere as well as the Finnish Cup in 2007. After a disappointing early season for Tampere United in 2008, the manager Ari Hjelm decided to try Myntti out as a striker. He has since emerged as one of the most prolific goalscorers in Veikkausliiga. In the 2008 season, Myntti won the title of top scorer in the Veikkausliiga. In January 2009, it was announced that he would transfer to Hansa Rostock. Myntti scored his first goal for the Rostock side on 6 March 2009 against FC St. Pauli. Even though his team got an early lead, the Hamburger won the match 2‚Äì3. After the season, he was suspended from the club. After struggling to make a further impact, he was released from his contract by mutual consent on 11 November 2009. On 22 December 2009, he signed a two-year contract with Tampere United.  Position  He is a tall central defender who can also play as striker.  International career  Myntti was capped 12 times for the Finnish national under-21 team. He also has caps at other youth levels.  Personal life  Myntti's grandfather, Stig-G√∂ran Myntti, was a regular member of the Finnish national team in the 1940s and 1950s.

The exterior is covered in a dark chocolate glaze. The Prinzregententorte is very popular in Bavaria, available in cake shops all year round. Origin The cake is named after Luitpold, prince regent of Bavaria from 1886. The cake's exact origin remains in dispute; among those claimed as its creators are the prince regent's cook, Johann Rottenhoeffer, the baker Anton Seidl, and the baking firm of Heinrich Georg Erbsh√§user. A Prinzregententorte originally had had 8 layers of cake and cream likewise, so as to represent the eight districts the Kingdom of Bavaria used to have back then. Since one of those regions, the Palatinate, was split off from Bavaria and merged with surrounding lands to form the new federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate by the American Military Government after World War II, which the locals later on confirmed in a plebiscite, those double- layers were subsequently reduced to seven. Recipe Typically, the cake consists of very thin layers of sponge cake, each approximately in diameter, with chocolate buttercream on each side. Apricot jam may be added to the topmost layer, and the whole cake is covered in dark chocolate.

The amount of internal heating depends on mass; the more massive the object, the more internal heat it has; also, for a given density, the more massive the object, the greater the ratio of mass to surface area, and thus the greater the retention of internal heat. The internal heating keeps celestial objects warm and active.  Small celestial objects  In the early history of the Solar System, radioactive isotopes having a half-life on the order of a few million years (such as aluminium-26 and iron-60) were sufficiently abundant to produce enough heat to cause internal melting of some moons and even some asteroids, such as Vesta noted above. After these radioactive isotopes had decayed to insignificant levels, the heat generated by longer-lived radioactive isotopes (such as potassium-40, thorium-232, and uranium-235 and uranium-238) was insufficient to keep these bodies molten unless they had an alternative source of internal heating, such as tidal heating. Thus, Earth's Moon, which has no alternative source of internal heating is now geologically dead, whereas a moon as small as Enceladus that has sufficient tidal heating (or at least had it recently) and some remaining radioactive heating, is able to maintain an active and directly detectable cryovolcanism.  Planets = Terrestrial planets  The internal heating within terrestrial planets powers tectonic and volcanic activities. Of the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, Earth has the most internal heating because it is the most massive. Mercury and Mars have no ongoing visible surface effects of internal heating because they are only 5 and 11% the mass of Earth respectively; they are nearly \\"geologically dead\\" (however, see Mercury's magnetic field and Geological history of Mars). Earth, being more massive, has a great enough ratio of mass to surface area for its internal heating to drive plate tectonics and volcanism.  Gas giants  The gas giants have much greater internal heating than terrestrial planets, due to their greater mass and greater compressibility making more energy available from gravitational contraction. Jupiter, the most massive planet in the Solar System, has the most internal heating, with core temperature estimated to be 36,000 K. For the outer planets of the Solar System, internal heating powers the weather and wind instead of sunlight that powers the weather for terrestrial planets. The internal heating within gas giant planets raise temperatures higher than effective temperatures, as in the case of Jupiter, this makes 40 K warmer than given effective temperature. A combination of external and internal heating (which may be a combination of tidal heating and electromagnetic heating) is thought to make giant planets that orbit very close to their stars (hot Jupiters) into \\"puffy planets\\" (external heating is not thought to be sufficient by itself).  Brown dwarfs  Brown dwarfs have greater internal heating than gas giants but not as great as stars. The internal heating within brown dwarfs (initially generated by gravitational contraction) is great enough to ignite and sustain fusion of deuterium with hydrogen to helium; for the largest brown dwarfs, it is also enough to ignite and sustain fusion of lithium with hydrogen, but not fusion of hydrogen with itself. Like gas giants, brown dwarfs can have weather and wind powered by internal heating. Brown dwarfs are substellar objects not massive enough to sustain hydrogen-1 fusion reactions in their cores, unlike main-sequence stars. Brown dwarfs occupy the mass range between the heaviest gas giants and the lightest stars, with an upper limit around 75 to 80 Jupiter masses (MJ). Brown dwarfs heavier than about 13 MJ are thought to fuse deuterium and those above ~65 MJ, fuse lithium as well.  Stars  The internal heating within stars is so great that (after an initial phase of gravitational contraction) they ignite and sustain thermonuclear reaction of hydrogen (with itself) to form helium, and can make heavier elements (see Stellar nucleosynthesis). The Sun for example has a core temperature of 13,600,000 K. The more massive and older the stars are, the more internal heating they have. During the end of its lifecycle, the internal heating of a star increases dramatically, caused by the change of composition of the core as successive fuels for fusion are consumed, and the resulting contraction (accompanied by faster consumption of the remaining fuel). Depending upon the mass of the star, the core may become hot enough to fuse helium (forming carbon and oxygen and traces of heavier elements), and for sufficiently massive stars even large quantities of heavier elements. Fusion to produce elements heavier than iron and nickel no longer produces energy, and since stellar cores massive enough to attain the temperatures required to produce these elements are too massive to form stable white dwarf stars, a core collapse supernova results, producing a neutron star or a black hole, depending upon the mass. Heat generated by the collapse is trapped within a neutron star and only escapes slowly, due to the small surface area; heat cannot be conducted out of a black hole at all (however, see Hawking radiation).

Luke was portrayed by Van Hansis, and Noah was portrayed by Jake Silbermann. On Internet message boards, the couple is referred to by the portmanteau \\"Nuke\\" (for Noah and Luke). They are notable for being one of American daytime television's first gay male couples. The two made history on August 17, 2007, when the show \\"featured the first-ever\\" gay male kiss in American daytime. The YouTube video of the kiss was one of the top-watched the following day. The kiss was later labeled \\"legendary\\" and was, at the time, one of the most viewed selections in the history of YouTube with over 2 million hits. In other press, the two were named one of television's top power couples by TV Guide and one of the great supercouples by Entertainment Weekly. They are American soap operas' first gay male supercouple. Background When Noah Mayer arrived in Oakdale in June 2007 and entranced resident gay character Luke Snyder, CBS's As the World Turns \\"became the first soap to depict a fully realized romantic male couple as an integral part of the show\\". There had been other gay male characters on U.S. daytime television, before; for example, One Life to Live Billy Douglas (portrayed by a young Ryan Phillippe), but Luke and Noah represented a change in the genre. Noah was at first presented as heterosexual and devoted to girlfriend Maddie Coleman. This soon began to change. The writers had always planned for Noah to be revealed as gay. The storyline and his interaction with Luke were promised to viewers as the start of a depiction of a healthy gay male romance. Within the story, after spending time with Luke, Noah is seen struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, and is often angry and confused. Luke and Noah's portrayers, Hansis and Silbermann, spoke with magazine The Advocate about the attention the storyline has generated. \\"The fan response has been really great to both the individual characters and where we're taking the relationship,\\" Silbermann stated. \\"Noah and Luke were voted top couple in a Soap Opera Digest poll. The funny thing is, a lot of people want them to be happy, but a lot want them to suffer heartache and tragedy -- because that's what couples on daytime TV do. It's a good sign, actually.\\" Hansis said that \\"it does throw you a bit, especially since this was [his] first big role on television\\" and \\"You go from waiting tables to doing interviews with national magazines and people saying that you changed their lives. It's definitely tricky\\". Addressing the depth of his character's romance with Luke and its effects on people, Silbermann cited his disbelief. \\"I knew what the role was when I signed on,\\" he said. \\"But I guess I'm jaded -- I honestly didn't think it would get so much press. Of course, I'm grateful and honored to be telling this story and doing it in an interesting and respectful way.\\" Actors' approach Actors have been known to bring some part of their real experience into the roles they portray. Hansis and Silbermann also spoke of this aspect regarding their own roles; they detailed what, if anything, they find useful in their lives when creating Luke and Noah. Hansis stated, \\"Luke is all about the need to be loved and accepted. I think that need is universal. Life is about acceptance from the people who you want to love you. If that means family, a wife, a husband, a girlfriend/boyfriend, a best friend, you just want people to love you for who you are. Anyone can relate to that.\\" Silbermann said, \\"I don't bring any specific experiences to Noah. I think we can all relate to an unrequited love or a romance filled with obstacles. That's really all this story is.\\" As the World Turns executive producer Chris Goutman stated in a WGN radio interview that Hansis and Silbermann are \\"both very modest actors\\". He credited them with having the ability to show the proper emotions in subtle and effective ways (i.e. \\"Luke's knowing smile and longing look at Noah, Noah's inner pain and fear of his father\\"). When asked if they rehearse together to decide which facial expressions they will use to convey these emotions in any given scene, Hansis replied, \\"No. We rehearse together to make sure we have the lines right. But it's not usually about the acting, its just running lines.\\" He said that the \\"acting comes\\" when the cameras are on. \\"We are comfortable with each other as actors, so if one of us does something new during taping, the other just rolls with it and it usually creates some nice moments,\\" said Hansis. Addressing the couple's possibility of marriage, children, and divorce, Hansis pondered \\"why can't people on soaps just date?\\" He said \\"maybe five years down the line they should have a kid, but not now\\" and that \\"[c]ollege has a whole slew of potential soap-worthy storylines. I think a lot of cool stories could come out of that\\". Silbermann voiced not knowing what the writers may have planned for the couple, but that \\"the audience can assume it won't be smooth sailing\\". Hansis clarified: \\"We have no idea what's happening until we get the scripts, which happens about a week in advance. We can talk to the producers if we want. I have done that once or twice, but they keep the writers and actors pretty separate.\\" Hansis and Silbermann cited their offscreen friendship as the reason for their ease when portraying intimate scenes between Luke and Noah. \\"It makes them easier. Jake is a good friend. I know he's got my back and is not going to make me look like an ass onscreen. I hope I return the favor,\\" said Hansis. \\"I think we work well together and I couldn't have asked for a cooler person to play opposite. Jake is just very down to earth and funny and open to different ideas. It makes every scene very comfortable.\\" Silbermann added, \\"I think we had become friends before the first kiss... If anything, I think it makes it more comfortable.\\" Storyline Luke and Noah meet at WOAK, a local television station in Oakdale, where they are working as interns, but their relationship is complex from the beginning. Luke's first crush for Kevin Davis ended badly when he \\"came out\\" to Kevin and was fiercely rejected, and Noah is involved with co- worker Maddie Coleman. In fact, Noah thinks jealously that Luke is pursuing his girlfriend until Luke reveals first his sexual orientation and then his attraction to Noah. After this, Noah struggles with his own feelings for Luke. One day, when Luke is helping Noah with his tie, Noah impulsively kisses him; he tries to shrug this off as a joke before finally admitting to himself and Luke that he meant it. He isn't, however, ready to deal with being gay. Although Luke urges him to be honest with Maddie and to acknowledge his own sexuality, Noah hesitates. Not completely unaware of the undercurrents between them, Maddie is forced to confront the budding romance between Noah and Luke when her brother Henry tells her that Noah's homophobic father, Army Colonel Winston Mayer, suspects the pair are involved. She asks Luke, and when he urges her to speak to Noah, realizes the truth. She breaks off her relationship with him. Colonel Mayer does what he can to prevent the young men from coming together, even threatening Luke's mother Lily, but just when he thinks Noah is safely reconciled with Maddie, he comes upon his son and Luke sharing their second kiss. Colonel Mayer disowns his son but later launches a more devious plot to kill Luke and get him out of Noah's life - a plot that is thwarted by Noah and Luke's parents. Noah and Luke come closer than ever as Luke uses physical therapy to recover the use of his legs, paralyzed in the Colonel's attempted murder. The relationship is not completely smooth, as Noah is still struggling somewhat with his own homosexuality, not able to express his feelings as freely as Luke. Noah continues to work on it, and it is at his instigation that the pair become housemates. While Noah had wanted to get an apartment alone with Luke, he compromises on Luke's suggestion by moving into Luke's family home, although the couple are not permitted to share a bed. Their new-found closeness is challenged when they meet a young Iraqi woman, Ameera Ali Aziz, who is in the United States on temporary visa and soon to be deported. Noah marries Ameera to help her remain in the United States, which requires that he hide his relationship with Luke and eventually move into a separate house with Ameera to make their relationship seems more legitimate. Ameera, it seems, would like for their relationship to be legitimate, but Noah continues to be devoted to Luke, whom he kisses again while shopping for a birthday present for Ameera. When Noah visits his father in prison, he crushes the Colonel's hopes by revealing that his marriage to Ameera is in name only and that he and Luke are still a couple. Not long thereafter, Ameera disappears, leaving a note saying that she will be able to stay in the country without the marriage and will have it annulled. Luke and Noah have little time to celebrate before they are advised that the Colonel has escaped from prison, which leads Noah to fear for his boyfriend's safety and also to worry that Ameera has been kidnapped. When Noah tries to track him down, the Colonel assaults him, but he manages to get away and reunite with Luke and Ameera, who has also escaped the Colonel. The Colonel is determined to get Ameera back under his control and tricks the young men with some fake police officers, but Luke calls upon his grandmother Lucinda, who brings real police to protect them. Following a confrontation with his son, the Colonel dives into the water and does not resurface; he is believed dead. Noah blames Luke for this for a time, but the couple eventually reunite after Cyndi Lauper, in town on the True Colors Tour, dedicates a set to Luke. Noah tells Luke he wants to be with him, and the couple kiss again. After Noah's decision to enlist in the army is derailed by the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy, which he defies, the couple resume living together at the Snyder farm, although they still do not share a bed. Soon thereafter, Luke starts the Luke Snyder Foundation for sick children with money inherited from his birth father's family, and the attorney they hire, Brian, begins throwing road blocks between them, cautioning Luke that being openly gay will hurt his foundation with conservative investors. Ultimately, however, it is Luke himself who causes the couple to break up, when he finds himself pitched in a dirty political campaign against his first love, Kevin. To counter the homophobic attacks of Kevin's supporters, Luke winds up permitting Casey Hughes to stuff the ballot box to ensure that he will win. Noah cannot take part in this dishonesty and refuses to lie for Luke when they are challenged. Feeling also that Luke has unresolved issues about Kevin, he moves out and distances himself. Luke begins drinking again and while drunk is kissed by Brian, who has married Luke's grandmother Lucinda. Later, Brian tells Luke that, while attracted to Luke, he loves Lucinda. In spite of their agreement, this will not remain secret long. Luke and Noah are struggling to reconnect, but when Luke is jealous of Noah's continued relationship with Maddie (who has interrupted their planned tryst on New Year's Eve), he kisses Brian himself. Noah, who sees this, is angry with Luke for some time, but when the pair finally come together to discuss the matter their anger is overwhelmed by their feelings for each other, and they finally consummate their relationship. It isn't long before they decide to finally live together in a place of their own. But when they are denied housing because they are gay, Luke turns his Luke Snyder Foundation to LGBT rights. This increases the amount of hate targeted at Luke, who is finally the victim in a hit and run. After Noah is blinded in an accident at film school, he breaks off with Luke, feeling a need to be independent and blaming Luke, because the couple had been arguing at the time of the accident. Noah finds a specialist, neurosurgeon Reid Oliver, whom he believes he can cure his sight, and Luke tries to lure the arrogant doctor to Oakdale; when promises of money do not work, he successfully blackmails him. In spite of this rocky start, the pair gradually fall in love. When Noah eventually begins to consider reuniting with Luke, Luke is torn - both angry at Noah's prior treatment and confused by his feelings for Reid. Reid eventually resigns from the hospital when he realizes that he must either do so or break off his relationship with Luke, the hospital's biggest donor, but is soon reinstated. Tragically, Reid is mortally injured when his car is struck by a train. During this time, Noah has relocated to Los Angeles to make a film under grant. When Reid dies, Noah returns in spite of himself to comfort his love, but while he is willing to remain in Oakdale with Luke, Luke urges him to pursue his dream. They agree that they will visit and one day may finally unite. Luke and Noah's last scenes together aired the day before the show's finale. After a 54-year run, As The World Turns was cancelled as of Sept 17, 2010. Luke and Noah's story ended onscreen at WOAK, but as the Executive Producer of the show has said, \\"Their relationship will endure.\\" Reception and impact Same-sex couples on American broadcast television are still rare today. This adds to the inclusion of same-sex pairings being considered \\"a very big deal\\". When Luke and Noah, a gay male teen couple at the time, were added to the soap opera As the World Turns, the decision especially constituted \\"an actual milestone\\" in gay visibility, stated Michael Jensen, Editor of AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media. CBS's As the World Turns \\"made that breakthrough in 2007 when Luke Snyder (Van Hansis) fell hard for newcomer Noah Mayer (Jake Silbermann). And viewers fell just as hard for the couple, quickly naming them Nuke as their growing popularity helped to push the show‚Äôs ratings up\\". The couple became \\"so popular\\" that a 2007 poll named them \\"the most popular couple on As the World Turns and one of the seven hottest couples on all of daytime television\\". Groundbreaking kiss and romance Luke and Noah kiss made famous in 2007. On August 17, 2007, Luke helps close friend Noah adjust his tie. Their eyes meet. Without warning, and in close-up, the two young men kiss full on the lips. The five-second kiss between Luke and Noah made history as the first gay male kiss on American daytime television. The guy-on-guy kiss \\"sizzled screens across America and sent the Internet into a tizzy\\".Original \\"Internet tizzy\\" report about kiss. Fans of the soap opera were divided on whether the kiss was a step forward or a sign of national moral decay. The kiss has been described as legendary, and, in 2008, it was one of the most viewed videos in the history of YouTube, with over 1 million views. It has currently been viewed more than 2 million times. Not long after the kiss, TV Guide named the couple one of soap opera's best supercouples, and Entertainment Weekly listed their kiss as one of the Landmark moments in Gay Hollywood, later titling the pairing as one of the greatest supercouples in the genre's history. More than six months after the kiss, Luke and Noah had \\"overcome Noah's sexual confusion and his stern, homophobic father, who shot Luke on a camping trip, temporarily confining him to a wheelchair. Noah nursed Luke back to health and helped him get back on his feet again. From there, their affection for each other blossomed.\\" When Luke and Noah's love story began, the ratings for As the World Turns rose considerably. The serial was near the bottom of the ratings competition in 2007, but began to regularly rank third behind The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful in the daytime Nielsens. This vastly contrasts from 1989, when As the World Turns sent a gay character away after protests from religious groups. \\"I don't see it as that big a deal,\\" Hansis stated. \\"I was just stoked to get a steady job as an actor.\\" \\"There aren't many gay characters on daytime,\\" Silbermann said. \\"It means a lot to know that this story is part of something.\\" =YouTube and influence on other countries= In large part due to the internet, both actors have received mail from viewers in countries that do not air As the World Turns. \\"YouTube now hosts a version of the Luke and Noah storyline that is edited by fans. In countries where it may not be OK to be gay, people hungry to see themselves accurately portrayed onscreen can go to YouTube and follow the 'Nuke' storyline in sequence,\\" stated David Alexander Nahmod of Bay Area Reporter. \\"Some producers balk at having their material posted at free sites like YouTube,\\" Nahmod added. \\"Producers of the former NBC soap Passions, [which later aired on DirectTV's The 101 as a subscription-only service], pulled its episodes off of YouTube. Likewise, episodes of British soap Coronation Street were also pulled from YouTube.\\" CBS, however, is content in letting the Luke and Noah love story stay on the file sharing sites because it is good and free publicity for the show. \\"Many gay viewers, for example, who are introduced to the Luke and Noah storyline on the internet may become interested in the whole show and start tuning into the CBS broadcasts. CBS also offers its own online broadcast of the show and www.CBS.com/daytime/ATWT.\\" Lisa Lugassy, press representative for As the World Turns, however, cited that [they] prefer people to watch the CBS airings. \\"It's the CBS audience, and not the online viewers, who give us our ratings,\\" she said. Hansis and Silbermann have acknowledged that they would like to do other acting projects when time permits, but that they are happy and content with the jobs they have now. \\"I hope to be playing Luke for a long, long time to come,\\" said Hansis. Controversy and praiseKiss debate, campaign and the media attention= Months after Luke and Noah's first kiss made national press, as well as their additional second kiss, the couple's time together was drastically reduced by the series. This was changed again when they were allowed to spend more onscreen time in each other's company but with an alteration; this alteration had the pairing no longer seen kissing onscreen. Any intimate interaction that took place onscreen between the couple was now showcased in the form of hugs, longing stares, talks and cut-away kisses (kisses that viewers do not see but almost get a glimpse of as the camera pans away or cuts to another scene). Frustrated, fans of the pairing organized what they called the \\"Kiss Campaign\\", in hopes to coax CBS and Procter & Gamble Productions into giving Luke and Noah another onscreen kiss. \\"Soaps, like all businesses, live and die by consumer response to a product,\\" campaign founder Jerome wrote at AfterElton.com. \\"And while email complaint letters certainly get noticed, it's the more-grandiose gestures that usually succeed in eliciting a response.\\" In a different campaign, Jerome was responsible for the decision to have fans of the television series Jericho send thousands of nuts to network executives in order to get the once-canceled show back on the air, and advised Luke-Noah supporters to flood CBS Daytime Programs Senior Vice President Barbara Bloom with Hershey's Kisses. \\"The symbolism,\\" Jerome noted, \\"is obvious.\\" Acknowledgment of the kiss campaign soon reached prominent media outlets such as The Boston Globe and the Associated Press. Boston Globe reporter Joanna Weiss began her report of the campaign by stating, \\"Once upon a time, in the melodramatic environs of CBS's As the World Turns, there was a boy named Luke and another boy named Noah, and they fell in love. They shared in self-discovery, made it through a trying time when Luke was paralyzed from the waist down, celebrated his miraculous recovery, and kissed onscreen. Twice. Then they stopped kissing. And some fans were happy. And some fans got very, very angry.\\" Addressed was that fans of the romance, referred to as Luke-and-Noah champions by Boston Globe, pointed to two major near-misses since the couple's two onscreen kisses. Once, during an episode of the soap opera near Christmas, Luke and Noah moved toward a kiss, and the camera quickly panned to a mistletoe, an event dubbed \\"Mistletoegate\\" by frustrated and disappointed fans. Then, on a \\"very special\\" Valentine's Day episode, every other couple on the show shared a kiss while Luke and Noah hugged. Boston Globe relayed that AfterElton.com created a running ticker of the time that had elapsed since Luke and Noah last kissed on the lips onscreen. At press time, it was 157 days and running. Also noted was Luke-and-Noah supporters having launched a publicity drive. During the drive, they \\"blitzed\\" reporters with long, heartfelt statements about their feelings for the pairing. \\"We appreciate so much that the show is doing this,\\" stated George Hinds, a youth employment counselor in Cambridge who helps run the fansite lukeandnoahfans.com. Hinds praised As the World Turns for airing a gay kiss within American daytime television. \\"The campaign is really here to let them know we think it's time to move forward. We think America can handle it.\\" Despite supporters of the Luke and Noah storyline, the producers of the series felt that showing a same-sex love story was a sensitive subject to show. \\"We're trying to make a show that appeals to our entire audience,\\" said Jeannie Tharrington, a spokeswoman for Procter & Gamble Productions, which produces the series. Tharrington said that she had been receiving complaints and applause from all sides since Luke and Noah's romance first began. The recent changes, she voiced, were implemented \\"because of some of the feedback that [they'd] gotten, and because of what [they] thought was best for the show creatively.\\" Boston Globe detailed that gay characters on television are common by now, \\"both on cable and on network shows such as ABC's hit drama Brothers and Sisters\\". They noted that Luke and Noah \\"follow in a long tradition of daytime soap characters with coming-out stories and with daytime talk show hosts such as Rosie O'Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres, both openly gay, having attracted broad fan bases\\". Within the series, Luke and Noah had talked about love, and had conversations about when they would first have sex. All this, combined with their very occasional kisses, made Luke and Noah representative of a new aspect within the soap opera world. \\"This was one more programming frontier,\\" said Andy Towle, who runs the popular gay-theme blog towleroad.com and keeps readers up to date on Luke and Noah developments. Luke's story of coming to terms with his sexuality began in late 2005, as the son of one of the show's longstanding couples, Holden Snyder and Lily Walsh. Bloom, CBS's senior vice president for daytime television, said the show's executive producer and head writer laid out a tentative long-term plotline in advance, unfolding it slowly so that the audience would conclude that Luke was gay before he officially announced it. From the start, she made clear, the writers hoped Luke would go on to become a central character, with everything that entails: \\"It's daytime television. It's the love story business.\\" Luke's coming-out story garnered praise in the gay community and an award from the gay-rights group Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Hansis and the actress who portrayed his mother (Martha Byrne) appeared in public service announcements on CBS. Tharrington said that due to Luke's storyline being successful, the writers eventually added Noah. \\"Everyone in the town came to accept Luke as he was, and the viewers did, too,\\" she elaborated. \\"What we kept hearing from viewers is, 'We love Luke. We want him to have a love interest, too.'\\" In 2008, Luke and Noah's story drew another GLAAD award nomination for the series. The storyline has often attracted gay men, who follow the show with \\"a mix of activist pride and love-struck glee\\". Luke and Noah clips on YouTube \\"have been edited from the episodes down to the relevant scenes\\". Hinds said he had started to watch the soap opera in its entirety, \\"because [he] just wanted the show to be successful -- to support the storyline\\". Though the Luke and Noah romance garnered positive reaction, Tharrington and CBS officials said they heard complaints from viewers opposed to the storyline. They would not say which side draws a bigger response. The American Family Association, a conservative group based in Tupelo, Mississippi, had received hundreds of complaints about the Luke and Noah romance -- particularly their kisses, said Randy Sharp, the group's spokesman. \\"It was a big turnoff for them,\\" Sharp said. \\"The word 'repulsive' was used once or twice. 'Offensive' was used more than once.... It was overtly gratuitous. It's not necessary to the storyline itself.\\" In 2004, Sharp's group supported a boycott of Procter & Gamble. They complained about some of its gay-friendly corporate policies. With the Luke and Noah story, Sharp detailed that group leaders had a phone conference with Procter & Gamble officials and asked members to contact the company. \\"Our request to them was to do away with the homosexual characters,\\" he cited. \\"Your writers can come up with good storylines that the general public would watch and not be offended by.\\" In contrast to Sharp's views, Hinds felt that the show's approach of implied kisses without showing them was likely not pleasing anyone. \\"Conservative fans,\\" he pointed out, \\"still see the intimacy.\\" Despite the protests against the Luke and Noah pairing, Bloom stated that support for it had been solid. \\"We have never in any way asked them to censor that story or pull it back,\\" she said. There are signs that, overall, the story has been good for As the World Turns, Bloom further relayed. Over the course of Luke's saga, Bloom noted, the show had moved into a solid position as the third-rated soap across all networks. Though Bloom and Tharrington insisted that the series would continue the Luke and Noah love story, they made no promises in regards to it. Drawn-out love stories, Bloom pointed out, are a daytime drama staple. \\"In the soap-opera business, you walk a very fine line between love stories, happily-ever-after, yearning, and obstacles,\\" Bloom cited. \\"The drama comes from the quest.\\" On March 2, 2008, David Bauder of the Associated Press put out an article regarding the controversy over Luke and Noah's non-kisses. \\"The love affair between two young men on the venerable CBS soap opera As the World Turns has triggered a protest campaign by angry viewers,\\" the report opened with. \\"It's just not the sort of protest you'd expect,\\" stated Bauder. \\"Fans of the fictional romance between Luke Snyder and Noah Mayer are baffled about why the two characters haven't kissed on-screen since September, wondering whether it's a sign of squeamishness by CBS or show sponsors Procter & Gamble Co.\\" \\"We totally support this show and applaud the show for doing this storyline,\\" said Roger Newcomb, a computer worker from New York's northern suburbs and the man behind the campaign. \\"We just don't understand why they have to be censored or treated differently.\\" Newcomb found it unrealistic that Luke and Noah had not been shown kissing onscreen since their first kiss. Tharrington assured that there was/is no kissing ban on Luke and Noah, although she would not say what would happen in future shows. She described the mistletoe shot as a \\"creative decision\\". \\"It's always hard to please a diverse audience,\\" Tharrington added, \\"and we have a diverse audience.\\" One fan had recalled reading a handful of letters in soap opera publications after Luke and Noah's first kiss along the lines of \\"I don't care if Luke is gay, but I don't want to see it.\\" Bloom stated that there was a \\"minimal\\" negative reaction from viewers about the storyline. Despite this, she could not clarify what \\"minimal\\" meant in this case. There had been no organized campaign by conservative or parent advocacy groups that monitor television content. \\"It's entirely new to me,\\" said Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council. \\"I hadn't heard anything about it.\\" The American Family Association website took a \\"take-action alert\\" against Procter & Gamble. They called the company the \\"top pro-homosexual sponsor on television\\". The group came to its conclusion based on the number of Procter & Gamble products advertised on primetime television shows with gay or lesbian characters. As the World Turns were not mentioned. One viewer along with Newcomb were more bothered by other things they had seen on the soap opera. They cited that a 14-year-old boy shot a man who was attacking his mother in 2008, and that \\"one character was so desperate for a baby that she slept with her ex-brother-in-law and was nearly caught having sex in an elevator. Another woman, they said, led her children and ex-husband into believing she had a brain tumor just to get him back\\". They felt that these incidents within the series were more offensive than two men kissing, and that the show should not have gone through with the Luke and Noah storyline if they were not going to finish it. A complicated factor to the Luke and Noah controversy is the couple's popularity. At the time, some 140 scenes featuring the two were posted online, a number that has since grown. The message board on Vanhansis.net gets posts from around the world. While competitors One Life to Live and Days of Our Lives saw double-digit drops in viewership over the past year, As the World Turns was down only 2 percent. Speculated was that the show's producers wanted and still want it \\"both ways\\" -- to get credit for having a gay couple but no backlash from long-term viewers for showing intimacy, relayed Carolyn Hinsey, editor of Soap Opera Weekly. Despite the speculation, Bloom stated that she would like to see Luke and Noah's romance continue. \\"If that means there is a natural progression to the physical relationship, I would be in support of it,\\" she said. Tharrington laughed when asked about any behind-the-scenes debates over showing intimacy between the two men. \\"You wouldn't even believe,\\" she told Associated Press. Producers are committed to telling the story of the romance, she added, stating that she hoped the audience would recognize what As the World Turns is showing, instead of just what it is not: \\"We feel like we're doing so much right here. We're telling a story that no one else is doing. We're telling a story that has really engaged our audience.\\" Within hours, all other news outlets such as CNN and FOX NEWS reported the Associated Press article, as debate about the no- kiss controversy became evident across the internet. On April 23, 2008, the two men kissed again for the third time onscreen, after months of campaigning from relentless fans of the couple.Witnessed on-air. April 23, 2008, As the World Turns. Washington Blade stated: Following Luke and Noah's third kiss, the show slowly allowed more and more physical intimacy between the two.Witnessed on-air. As the World Turns. Throughout the month of August 2008, every episode featuring Luke and Noah also included at least one kiss. Consummation Clock A debate regarding whether or not Luke and Noah would be allowed a sex scene led AfterElton.com to change their \\"LipLock Clock\\" to a \\"Consummation Clock\\" which counted how many days the couple had gone without having sex. This was done to try and persuade the producers and writers to portray their relationship with the same freedoms as they would a heterosexual couple. On January 12, 2009, the clock stopped when the couple finally consummated their relationship; they had sex for the first time, which pleased a significant portion of the audience. However, the love scene was not shown onscreen. TV Guide columnist Michael Logan said that the lack of promotion for the sex scene may have been a deliberate strategy to avoid giving protesters a chance to pressure the network from cutting the storyline. \\"Are they being savvy or scared?\\" he said. \\"I don‚Äôt know.\\" In addition, Logan commented on how long it took the series to have the two become physically intimate with each other. \\"It was getting goofy-ridiculous how long it took,\\" said Logan. \\"But it happened. It‚Äôs historic, I guess.\\" Criticism=Airtime Gay and Lesbian Times reported receiving 20 letters from fans complaining about Luke and Noah's lack of airtime as a couple. In June and April, Luke and Noah were showcased in a total of seven episodes,Witnessed on air. As the World Turns. which caused an uproar. Fans began campaigning in various ways in hopes of getting the couple featured more. In contrast to the usual praise for the couple's campaigns, the Gay and Lesbian Times criticized fans of the couple on September 4, 2008 for their campaign efforts. They called it unbelievable that people counted the number of episodes Luke and Noah appeared in and shared together and that it would be \\"easy to laugh at the trivial nature of the fans concerns\\" if not for \\"the state of all nonfiction (read: real) gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people nationwide and internationally\\". Gay and Lesbian Times stated that there are more important things in life than the romance of two soap opera characters. At the time, Luke and Noah had appeared in only 12 of 60 episodes and shared \\"a scant 36 minutes together\\" onscreen; the heterosexual couples had been sexually intimate 23 times onscreen, but not Luke and Noah.

He played halfback and quarterback for the University of Illinois from 1914 to 1916 and helped the school to its first national football championship and consecutive undefeated seasons in 1914 and 1915. He later played professional football for the Canton Bulldogs and Youngstown Patricians. He was also the coach and owner of the Oakland Oaks in the Pacific Coast professional football league founded in 1926. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972. Biography=Early years at Oak Park A native of Oak Park, Illinois. His father, Frank Macomber, had once been the mayor of Oak Park. Macomber played high school football for Hall of Fame coach Bob Zuppke at Oak Park High School. Macomber played on three consecutive undefeated teams at Oak Park and once kicked 16 extra points in a single game against Chicago Englewood in October 1911. At Oak Park, Macomber set state high school records for most extra points in a career (114 from 1910 to 1912) and a season (55 in 1912). His records were not broken for more than 70 years. In 1911, Zuppke persuaded the team from St. John's of Danvers, Massachusetts, one of the top high school teams in the east, to travel to Chicago for what was billed as a match for the \\"national interscholastic football title.\\" Oak Park won the game 17‚Äì0, and the Chicago Daily News reported: \\"The winners outclassed the eastern men using open style of football. The visitors played the old style football, hammering Oak Park's line on nearly every play ‚Ä¶ [while] Macomber used the forward pass combined with trick formations with great success.\\" Zuppke's Oak Park team was considered one of the best in the country, and he scheduled several other intersectional games, all of which were won by Oak Park. The scores of the intersectional games played by Zuppke and Macomber follow: * December 26, 1910: Oak Park defeats Wenatchee (Seattle), 22 to 0 * December 31, 1910: Oak Park defeats Washington (Portland), 6 to 3 * December 2, 1911: Oak Park defeats St John's (Danvers, Mass), 17 to 0 * November 30, 1912: Oak Park defeats Everett (Mass), 32 to 14 When Zuppke was hired as head coach at the University of Illinois, Macomber followed Zuppke and enrolled at Illinois. Football player at Illinois Macomber played halfback and quarterback at Illinois from 1914 to 1916. He helped the Illini to the school's first national championship in 1914 and consecutive undefeated seasons in 1914 and 1915. The 1914 team allowed only 22 total points during an undefeated 7‚Äì0 season. Macomber was selected as a first-team All-American in 1915. In naming Macomber to his All-American team, Walter Camp praised Macomber's \\"kicking and field generalship.\\" Macomber was elected captain of the 1916 Illinois team. He played halfback for the Illini in 1914 and 1915 before switching to quarterback in 1916. Macomber also handled kicking duties at Illinois. At the end of the 1916 season, Macomber was selected by Walter Eckersall as the All- Big Ten Conference quarterback. Eckersall wrote of Macomber: > \\"Bart Macomber, leader of the University of Illinois eleven, is selected to > play quarterback and to act as captain of the All-Conference eleven. He is > one of the best players who has worn an Illinois uniform in years. It was > largely through his efforts, offensively and defensively, that the Illini > have held a commanding position in Conference football for the last three > years. Macomber is one of the most dependable kickers who has represented a > Conference eleven in years. He can punt for an average of forty-five yards, > kick goals from the fleld either by placement or drop kick, and is sure on > kicking goals after touchdowns. ‚Ä¶ The Illinois captain has been a factor in > all games played by the Zuppke eleven this year.

In > the Minnesota game, which resulted in an unexpected victory Macomber was the > one player who brought victory to his team. His forward passing and stellar > defensive play hardly could have been improved upon.\\" Macomber was also selected in 1916 as a second-team All-American quarterback by Eckersall and sports writer, Paul Purman, and as a first-team All-American quarterback by Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost. The \\"greatest football upset of all time\\" Zuppke and Macomber combined for five undefeated seasons, three at Oak Park High School (1910‚Äì1912) and two at Illinois (1914‚Äì1915). However, in Macomber's senior year, the Illini lost three games to Colgate, Ohio State and Chicago. Late in the 1916 season, Illinois was scheduled to play the west's top team, the University of Minnesota. Minnesota had beaten Iowa 67‚Äì0, Wisconsin 54‚Äì0, and Chicago (a team that beat Illinois) 49‚Äì0. Before the game, sports writer Ring Lardner published a letter to Zuppke urging him to stay in Chicago and see a play. Lardner joked that \\"the lucky players were those on crutches, since they would not have to face the northern monster.\\" Macomber later recalled Zuppke's pre-game strategy as follows: > \\"We began practicing. We were so nervous and upset we could not even hang > onto the ball. Coach Bob soon saw that the whole effort was useless. He was > afraid it would only demoralize us for the next day. So he called practice > off. He waited a bit for full attention and said, 'If you are going to be > slaughtered tomorrow, you might as well break training and have a good time > tonight.' He told us to try to relax, to eat and drink whatever we liked, > maybe see a show. We trooped back to our hotel, the Radison. The whole squad > of 25, including coaching staff, napped and idled the afternoon away. That > evening we went on the town. No one counted the drinks or the beers. We ate > large dinners and moved the celebration over to a burlesque house. There was > no bed check.\\" According to a 1964 account of the game published by Sports Illustrated, Macomber called for a spread formation against Minnesota, \\"employed in this game for the first time by any team.\\" Operating out of the formation, Macomber ran for a touchdown and kicked the extra point. After taking a 14‚Äì0 lead in the first half, Zuppke told quarterback Macomber to run out the clock in the second half: > \\"Zup had told me to stall as much and as long as I could get away with it. ‚Ä¶ > I killed all the time I could as those angry fans screamed at me with time > running out. My shoes needed tieing, one, then the other. Shoulder pads > wanted adjusting, or something was wrong with the way they were laced. I > miscalled signals a few times. The whistle was blown on me twice, each time > for a five-yard penalty. The stalling rules then were not too strict.\\" Illinois hung on to the lead and won the upset victory by a score of 14‚Äì9. The result was for many years \\"generally accepted as the greatest football upset of all time.\\" After the game, one Chicago newspaper published this headline: \\"We Don't Believe It!\\" NEA sports editor Harry Grayson noted that Macomber had been \\"prominent in college dramatics,\\" and wrote that he \\"never acted more than during the last quarter of Illinons' astounding 14‚Äì9 victory over Minnesota in 1916.\\" According to Grayson's account, \\"Macomber untied his shoes, broke the string on his shoulder pads, lost his headgear, miscalled signals ‚Äî- anything to kill time. It easily was his greatest role as an actor.\\" Professional football, vaudeville and military service After Illinois' 1916 win over Minnesota, one book indicates that Macomber \\"left school for the Orpheum vaudeville circuit.\\" A March 1917 advertisement for the Orpheum vaudeville show appearing in Madison, Wisconsin promoted appearances by Kenneth Loane, Hoyt's Minstrels, and \\"Bart Macomber, The Famous Halfback in SONGS & STORIES.\\" Macomber also went on to play professional football with the Youngstown Patricians in 1917. In 1917, he played halfback for a Youngstown team that included multiple college all-stars, including Tommy Hughitt of Michigan, Tom Gormley of Georgetown, and Freeman Fitzgerald, Bill Kelleher, Gil Ward and Stan Cofall of Notre Dame. Macomber also served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I. In 1919, Macomber played for a team in Canton, Ohio known as the Canton Vets, made up entirely of players who were veterans of the World War. In 1926, Macomber was the owner, coach, and director of the Oakland Oaks in the newly formed Pacific Coast Professional Football League. Macomber's team, the first professional football team in Oakland, was short-lived playing only five games as follows: * November 7, 1926: 0‚Äì10 loss to the Hollywood Generals, played at Oakland Baseball Park with 4,000 in attendance * November 14, 1926: 3‚Äì0 win over the San Francisco Tigers, played at Ewing Field in San Francisco * November 21, 1926: 10‚Äì9 win over the Los Angeles Angels, played at Oakland Baseball Park with 1,200 in attendance * December 5, 1926: 23‚Äì7 win over the San Francisco Tigers played at Oakland Baseball Park with 3,000 in attendance * December 12, 1926: 0‚Äì7 loss to the Hollywood Generals, played at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles Later years After retiring from football, Macomber moved to Portland, Oregon. Macomber died in Oregon in 1971 and was posthumously inducted the following year into the College Football Hall of Fame.

While playing halfback for Harvard, Mahan was selected as a first-team All-American three consecutive years from 1913 to 1915. He was widely regarded as one of the greatest football players in the first 50 years of the sport and was named by Jim Thorpe as the greatest football player of all time. In 1951, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as part of the first group of inductees. Early years Mahan was a native of Natick, Massachusetts. He was of Irish ancestry and reportedly spoke with \\"the brogue of a full-blooded native of Erin.\\" Mahan first gained attention for his football skills while playing at Andover. Mahan later recalled his days at Andover, \\"Well do I recall those wonderful days at Andover and the games between Andover and Exeter. There is intense rivalry between these two schools. Many are the traditions at Andover.\\" All-American football player Mahan enrolled at Harvard in 1912 and played halfback for Harvard's varsity football team. Although he weighed only 165 pounds, Mahan played every minute of every football game for Harvard from 1913 to 1915. Mahan was selected as a first-team All-American in each of those years, leading Harvard to a three- year record of 24‚Äì1‚Äì2. Mahan carries against Princeton, 1915 Mahan played his first varsity game for Harvard in 1913 against Maine and scored two touchdowns, including a 67-yard run. And in the 1915 Harvard‚ÄìPrinceton game, he threw a pass for a 61-yard gain on a fake punt. As a senior and team captain in 1915, Mahan climaxed his college football career by scoring four touchdowns and kicking five extra points in a 41‚Äì0 win over Yale, the worst defeat in Yale's 44 years of college football to that time. In the biography of Mahan at the College Football Hall of Fame, it is said that Mahan electrified the crowd in the 1915 Harvard-Yale game with \\"one of the greatest individual performances of the game's Pioneer Era.\\" Harvard's sole loss during Mahan's three years on the team was a 10‚Äì0 loss to Cornell in 1915. After the game, Mahan apologized to Harvard coach Percy Haughton. Haughton reportedly responded, \\"Mahan, you are the greatest football player God ever made.\\" Mahan later described his technique for evading tacklers as follows: \\"I simply give them the foot‚Äîright or left‚Äîand then take it away.\\" Recognition as one of the greatest football players of all time When Jim Thorpe was asked to choose the greatest football player of all time, he selected Mahan. He explained his choice as follows: > \\"Eddie Mahan of Harvard was the greatest football player I have ever seen. > He had everything, he could run, pass and kick. He was big, weighed 190 > pounds, was smart enough to play quarterback and also good enough to play in > the line. To me that's proof enough that Mahan was the tops. He was a > specialist in all lines.\\" In his book about the early days of football, Bill Edwards wrote the following about Mahan: \\"If the future football generals develop a better all-around man than Eddie Mahan, captain of the great Harvard team of 1915, whose playing brought not only victory to Harvard but was accompanied by great admiration throughout the football world, they may well congratulate themselves.\\" In November 1925, football writer W.B. Hanna compared Red Grange to Mahan: > \\"In the writer's opinion, Grange and Mahan are the greatest backs he ever > saw, from the standpoint of advancing the ball. Grange seems to run with > more power than Mahan and a trifle more laboriously, because he is not quite > so light-footed. It may be doubted whether he is as fast, but that is mere > guesswork. Football, carrying the ball, seemed play to Mahan. Grange does > not do his work in quite that effortless manner.\\" Mahan was frequently mentioned among the greats of the game. In 1927, George Trevor of the New York Sun selected an all-time backfield made up of Mahan, Walter Eckersall, Jim Thorpe, and Willie Heston of Michigan. In 1928, Grantland Rice named Mahan to his all-time team and wrote, \\"Mahan lacked the crashing force of a Heston or a Coy, but he was one of the smoothest running backs anyone ever saw.\\" Western football expert Walter Eckersall added, \\"Mahan is awarded the honor of being Harvard's greatest football player, a terror to the opposition offensively and defensively. As a line plunger he ranks with the greatest in history.\\" In 1951, Mahan was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as part of the first group of inductees. Baseball player Mahan also played for Harvard's varsity baseball team for three years. In an exhibition game in the spring of 1916, Mahan pitched a shutout against the Boston Red Sox, the year after the Red Sox team featuring Babe Ruth and Tris Speaker won the 1915 World Series. Mahan was offered a contract by several major league clubs, but none was willing to meet his demand for a salary of $6,500. Mahan described his negotiations in an interview with the Oakland Tribune: > \\"I had a chance first to go with the Boston Red Sox when I was in my senior > year at Harvard. They said to name my price and I named $6,500. They thought > it was too much. Then the Detroit club made an offer to me but they too > thought I had a gold-brick scheme. The Chicago White Sox were willing to > give me a good contract with a bonus if I made good, but the risk was not > worth the undertaking. I considered the Braves more seriously than any other > team but my negotiations there too were not satisfactory ...\\" Coaching and military service Mahan received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard in the spring of 1916, with a major in political science and economy. He played semi-professional baseball in New Haven during the summer of 1916 and also worked as the head of the Woodrow Wilson clubs in New York state. In August 1916, Mahan accepted a position as assistant football coach at the University of California. After one season at Berkeley, Mahan returned to the East. Press accounts at the end of the 1916 season reported that Mahan and Cal's head coach (an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania) had vastly different styles of coaching, and Mahan was never given an opportunity to play an active role in coaching the team. During World War I, Mahan served as a first lieutenant with the U.S. Marine Corps. At the end of the war, Mahan remained in Europe for a time working for Herbert Hoover's Food Administration. In a January 1919 game played in France, Mahan led a Navy football team to a 12‚Äì0 win over a U.S. Army team. A press account reported that Mahan was the star of the game, running 65 yards for the first touchdown: > \\"In spite of the muddy field, speed and generalship on the part of the > S.O.S. eleven, largely in the person of Eddie Mahan, ‚Ä¶ told the tale. It was > the tall, black-haired Mahan with an undershot jaw that broke the deadlock > in the second period. He grabbed a short punt ‚Ä¶, eluded two men who barred > his path, shook off a third tackler further down the field, and sprinted 65 > yards for a touchdown.\\" After the war, Mahan returned to Harvard as the coach of the team's halfbacks. In August 1924, he was also appointed head coach of the Harvard baseball team. Later years In 1926, Mahan went to Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut. He also served as director of athletics at the Newman School in Lakewood, New Jersey. After retiring from athletics, Mahan worked in the investment banking field and later worked for the Massachusetts Department of Natural Resources. He made his debut in investment banking in August 1927, accepting a position with the Wall Street firm Hornblower & Weeks. He also served as a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy during World War II. In 1975, after a long illness, Mahan died of cancer at Glover Memorial Hospital in Needham, Massachusetts. At the time of his death, Mahan was a resident of his hometown, Natick, Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife, Beryl Boardman Mahan, two daughters, and six grandchildren.

The walks in [borders] are beautiful, and, as though we were transported directly into Thoreau's walking shoes, one can \\"glimpse Elysium,‚Äù but only as Thoreau might have: Whilst walking along, surveying the boundaries and divisions. In following virtual property lines, the walker becomes stuck in stones, sent underwater, and literally teeters at the edge of the world, thus exposing the algorithmic nature of the rendering of landscape and the invisible disruptions in a seamless world. [borders] has since been exhibited in several locations including the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology in Lisbon, Portugal in October 2019, the Museum of Fine Arts in Cologne from 2017 to 2018, and the Electronic Language International Festival in 2014. =[xyz]= xyz (2009) combined Flanagan's interests in virtual environments and interactive writing, allows participants to build poetry in 2 dimensional game worlds.

The software, developed by Flanagan herself, was able to combine the poems of French surrealist artist Dora Maar with her own. Maar's poems would start on the left and Flanagan's on the right, then the software would merge the poems together to create new ones with different meanings than they had originally. Flanagan describes this process as a way to collaborate with the late Dora Maar.  Writing  Based on her PhD dissertation, the book Critical Play: Radical Game Design (MIT Press, 2009) examines how artists and activists throughout history have used games as instruments for social critique.https://web.archive.org/web/20100127183815/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid;=11870Mosher, Michael R. \\"Review of 'Critical Play: Radical Game Design.'\\" Leonardo Reviews Online.

She was the lead ship in her class. Operational history President Jackson was laid down as MC hull 53 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia. 2 October 1939; launched 7 June 1940; sponsored by Mrs. William G. McAdoo; and delivered to the American President Lines 25 October 1940. After two round-the-world trips from New York City, President Jackson was acquired by the navy 30 June 1941, and commissioned 16 January 1942, Commander. C. W. Weitzel in command.

On 21 February, while operating with TF 51, she landed elements of the 3rd Marine Division on Iwo Jima. Exposed to enemy counter-battery fire, she was hit once in a barrage of 37mm fire with minor damage and casualties. On 6 March she departed Iwo Jima with 515 casualties for Saipan and Noumea. With army and navy casualties and miscellaneous passengers aboard, the transport sailed for the United States 7 May 1945. She got underway from San Francisco, 14 June and completed two round-trips to Manila before the cessation of hostilities which found her in drydock at Seattle, Washington. She then entered upon \\"Operation Magic Carpet\\" duty. Post war period President Jackson continued to operate with the U.S. Pacific Fleet until 1949, seeing service in both Japan and China. She was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service with her designation changed to T-AP-18, 22 October 1949. On 7 February 1950 President Jackson, with cabin and troop passengers on board, got underway from San Francisco for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving 23 February.

Massacre=Overview The Wagalla massacre took place on 10 February 1984 at the Wagalla Airstrip. The facility is situated approximately 15 km (9 mi) west of the county capital of Wajir in the North Eastern Province, a region primarily inhabited by ethnic Somalis. Kenyan troops had descended on the area to reportedly help defuse clan-related conflict. However, according to eye-witness testimony, about 5,000 Somali men were then taken to an airstrip and prevented from accessing water and food for five days before being executed by Kenyan soldiers.Wagalla massacre: Raila Odinga orders Kenya probe According to a commissioner with The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya, a government oversight body that had been formed in response to the 2008 Kenyan post-election violence, the Wagalla massacre represents the worst human rights violation in Kenya's history. Death toll The exact number of people killed in the massacre is unknown. However, eyewitnesses place the figure at around 10,000 deaths. Aftermath For years the Kenyan government denied that a massacre had taken place and insisted that \\"only 57 people were killed in a security operation to disarm the [area's] residents\\". It was not until October 2000 that the government publicly acknowledged wrongdoing on the part of its security forces. In 2010, Bethuel Kiplagat stepped aside as chairman of the Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission because of his alleged involvement in authorising the action that led to the massacre.US professor quits Kenyan truth commission, citing lack of confidence CS Monitor Reports of the number of men from the Somali Degodia sub-clan, in particular, that were detained by security forces and brought to the airstrip range from 381 to upward of ten thousand. (alternate link) In April 2012, Kiplagat was reinstated as TJRC chairman after the Justice Minister Eugene Wamalwa brokered a truce between him and the other commissioners. Kiplagat, TJRC foes call a truce The same year, the former Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga ordered an official probe into the atrocities and indicated that the national attorney general should bring to justice those responsible for the killings. Odinga also ordered a museum to be constructed in honour of the victims. In February 2015, the Wajir County governor Ahmed Abdullahi said his government would partner with local and international human rights organisations in seeking justice for the victims of the massacre, saying that the Truth Commission report offered such an opportunity which remained squandered. \\"Those mentioned by the TJRC report and witnesses must be prosecuted. The people who afflicted the pain to our people remain unpunished and are still with us,\\" Abdullahi said.See: Kenya: Wajir Governor to Sue State Over Wagalla Massacre, AllAfrica/The Star, 15 February 2015.

Mann ran for the U.S. Senate in the 1941 special election, called after the death of Senator Morris Sheppard. His opponents included Lyndon B. Johnson, then a member of the United States Congress, and Governor Pappy O'Daniel, who won the seat.

On December 29, 1883 a post office was established under the name Rush Valley. In 1894 the name was changed to Rushland. Located along the Mill Creek near Rushland was a settlement started by Italian immigrants who came to the area as laborers when the railroad was being built in the last decade of the nineteenth century. Their community became known as Little Italy. By forcing its way through a rocky cliff, the railroad opened a major industry for Rushland, the stone quarry, an industry that continues to this day.

Gomphi is shown to the centre left. Gomphi () was a town and polis (city-state) of Histiaeotis in ancient Thessaly, situated upon a tributary of the Peneius, and near the frontiers of Athamania and Dolopia. Its position made it a place of historical importance, since it guarded two of the chief passes into the Thessalian plains: \\"that of Mus√°ki, distant two miles [three km], which was the exit from Dolopia, and the pass of Portes, at a distance of four miles [six km], which led into Athamania, and through that province to Ambracia.\\"William Martin Leake, Travels in Northern Greece, vol. iv., p. 521. In the war against Philip V of Macedon, Amynander of Athamania, king of the Athamanes, in co-operation with the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus, having descended from the latter pass, first took Pheca, a town lying between the pass and Gomphi, and then Gomphi itself, 198 BCE. The possession of this place was of great importance to Flamininus, since it secured him a communication with the Ambracian Gulf, from which he derived his supplies. The route from Gomphi to Ambracia is described by Livy as very short but extremely difficult. The capture of Gomphi was followed by the surrender of the towns named Argenta, Pherinum, Thimarum, Lisinae, Stimo, and Lampsus, the position of which is quite uncertain. When Athamania revolted from Philip in 189 BCE, he marched into their country by the above-mentioned pass, but was obliged to retire with heavy loss. There can be no doubt that it was by the same route that the Roman consul Quintus Marcius Philippus marched from Ambracia into Thessaly in 169 BCE. In the campaign between Julius Caesar and Pompey in 48 BCE, the inhabitants of Gomphi, having heard of Caesar's repulse at Dyrrhachium, shut their gates against him, when he arrived at the place from Aeginium; but he took the place by assault in a few hours. Caesar, in his account of these events, describes Gomphi as the \\"first town in Thessaly to those coming from Epirus.\\"Caes. B.C. 3.80; Appian, Civil Wars, 2.64; D. C. 41.51. Coins minted at Gomphi survive. The Byzantine author Hierocles notes that Gomphi was a bishopric in later times. No longer a resident bishopric, it remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.Catholic Hierarchy The site of the ancient town is near Mouzaki.

He studied the clarinet, composition and musicology in Vienna. Salmhofer served successively as Kapellmeister of the Burgtheater, Director of the Vienna State Opera and Director of the Vienna Volksoper and composed a number of works, few of which are played today.  Biography  Born in Vienna, Austria, Salmhofer came from a modest background, his father being a pianist and his mother a cook. His father became an invalid following service in the First World War and his son had to use his musical talent to assist in providing for the family. Salmhofer was educated at the Admont Abbey in the province of Styria from 1909-1914, where he was a choirboy, and in 1916 went on to study musicology, clarinet and composition at the Institute for Musicology at the University of Vienna where he was a pupil of Franz Schreker, Franz Schmidt and Guido Adler. He was part of a class that included Ernst Krenek, Wilhelm Grosz, Karol Rathaus, Joseph Rosenstock, , , Paul Pisk and Jascha Horenstein.Stewart, John L. 1991, Ernst Krenek: The Man and His Music, Berkeley: University of California Press, p15 Thereafter he worked as a choir conductor and organist. In 1929 he was appointed Kapellmeister of the Burgtheater where he served until 1945 when he became the first post-war Director of the Vienna State Opera, a post he filled until 1953. In this position he worked at several temporary locations until the war-damaged Opera House could be restored. Thereafter he was Director of the Vienna Volksoper until his retirement in 1963.Uwe Harten, Art. \\"Salmhofer, Franz‚Äü, in: Oesterreichisches Musiklexikon online Zugriff: 21.1.2017 Director of the State Opera Salmhofer's appointment as the post-War Director of the Vienna State Opera in 1945 came as somewhat of a surprise, but can be attributed to several factors. His predecessor, Karl B√∂hm, a friend of Joseph Goebbels, had been removed due to his Nazi sympathies.Weyr, Thomas. 2005,The Setting of the Pearl: Vienna under Hitler, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p397 Salmhofer had not been a nazi sympathiser and his works had come close to being banned during that period. In addition he had had to protect his first wife whose background did not comply with the nazi race laws. His time at the Burgteater had also given him wide experience in managing a theatre and he had a considerable reputation as a composer and musician and was known for his fervent love of Austria, an advantage during the period of revival of national identity. The first post- war performance of the Staatsoper, Mozart's Figaro, took place at the Volksoper under the baton of Salmhofer and at the request of the Russian occupying forces on 1 May 1945. As director he was an astute and wily diplomat who was quickly able to revive the theatre that had been badly damaged during allied bombing of Vienna and which was temporarily relocated to the Theater an der Wien, where it remained for the following decade. Personal life In 1923 he married the pianist Margit G√°l and, after her death in March 1954, was married to Margarethe Arndt from 1955 until his death in 1975.  Music  During his lifetime Salmhofer wrote over 300 works for stage, working mainly in the genres of ballet and opera. He could be termed a 'late romantic' as he took romanticism as a starting point and frequently drew inspiration from folk traditions. Some also regarded him as a 'progressive', but he was careful to avoid controversial themes that in the political mood of the 1930s and 1940s could have led to sanction of his works and, like many others of his generation, immigration or exile from his home country. He was one of the most widely performed composers of his generation. His 1951 setting of 's poems, Heiteres Herbarium, as songs is said to stand out among his works, but are 'a largely unknown masterpiece' of which the 1956 recording by Julius Patzak, with Salmhofer accompanying him on the piano, is the best known recording.Stokes R, The Book of Lieder - The original texts of over 1000 songs, Faber & Faber List of major compositions * Opera: Faust (1927) * Ballet: Das Lockende Phantom (1927) * Ballet: Der Taugenichts in Wien (1930) * Ballet: Das Weihnachtsm√§rchen (1931) * Ballet: √ñsterreichische Bauernhochzeit (1933) * Opera: Dame im Traum (1935) * Film Score: Last Love (1935) * Opera: Iwan Tarassenko - Version 1 (1938) * Opera: Das Werbekleid Salzburg (1943) * Film Score: Das andere Leben (1948) * Opera: Iwan Tarassenko - Version 2 (1948) * Film Score: Das Siegel Gottes (1949) * Film Score: Der Wallnerbub (1950) * Songs: Heiteres Herbarium (1951) * Opera: Dreik√∂nig (1970)Stokes R., The Book of Lieder - The original texts of over 1000 songs, Faber & Faber  Honours and awards  * City of Vienna Music Prize (1926 & 1960) * Austrian State Prize for Composition (1937) * Karl Renner Prize (1954) * Silver Decoration of the state of Vienna (1960) * Honorary Member of the Austrian Federal Theatre (1963) * Federal Capital of Vienna Medal of Honour in gold (1965) * Ring of Honour of the City of Vienna (1970)  Eponyms  Two places in Vienna bear Salmhofer's name: * Salmhoferstra√üe (Inzersdorf area south of the city centre) * Franz-Salmhofer-Platz (The square in front of the Volksoper).

He was expected to miss around 6 weeks due to the injury.Fractured fibula, Week 8, 2013 However, he instead sat out the rest of the season, which also left his 1,000-yard receiving streak at nine.

He won his second Grey Cup championship following the Stampeders' 20-16 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

Important documents are often printed on cotton paper, because it is known to last many years without deterioration. Cotton paper is superior in both strength and durability to wood pulp-based paper, which may contain high concentrations of acids, and also absorbs ink or toner better. Different grades of cotton paper can be produced. Properties High-quality cotton fibre paper is known to last hundreds of years without appreciable fading, discoloration, or deterioration, so it is often used for important documents, such as the archival copies of dissertations or theses. As a rule of thumb, for each percentage point of cotton fibre, a user may expect one year of resisting deterioration by use (the handling to which paper may be subjected).Southworth Paper Co Legal document paper typically contains 25% cotton. Cotton paper will produce a better printout than copy paper because it can more readily absorb ink or toner. Cotton paper is typically graded as 25%, 50%, or 100% cotton. Usually it can be checked by holding the cotton paper up to the light and looking just below the watermark for a number. 100% cotton paper may contain small amounts of acids, and should be tested or certified before use for archival documents. Second-cut cotton linters have a normal average fibre length of 1.45 Œºm, and have similar properties as a short softwood pulp. Uses Cotton bond paper can be found at most stores that sell stationery and other office products. Some cotton paper contains a watermark. It is used for banknotes in a number of countries. These banknotes are typically made from 100% cotton paper, but can also be made with a mixture of 75% or less flax. Other materials may also be used and still be known as currency paper. Higher quality art papers are often made from cotton. It has found extensive use as a printed circuit board substrate when mixed with epoxy resins and classified into CEM 1, CEM 2 etc. History Cotton was first used with a mixture of silk to make paper called Carta Bombycina. In the 1800s, fiber crops such as flax fibres or cotton from used cloths (rags) were the primary material source. By the turn of the 20th century, most paper was made from wood pulp, but cotton is still used in specialty papers. As cotton rags now often contain synthetic fibres, papermakers have turned to second-cut cotton linters as raw material sources for making pulp for cotton papers.

The angel wears iconographic dress. English ploughmen, c. 1000 Early medieval European dress, from about 400 to 1100, changed very gradually. The main feature of the period was the meeting of late Roman costume with that of the invading peoples who moved into Europe over this period. For a period of several centuries, people in many countries dressed differently depending on whether they identified with the old Romanised population, or the new populations such as Franks, Anglo-Saxons, Visigoths. The most easily recognisable difference between the two groups was in male costume, where the invading peoples generally wore short tunics, with belts, and visible trousers, hose or leggings. The Romanised populations, and the Church, remained faithful to the longer tunics of Roman formal costume, coming below the knee, and often to the ankles. By the end of the period, these distinctions had finally disappeared, and Roman dress forms remained mainly as special styles of clothing for the clergy ‚Äì the vestments that have changed relatively little up to the present day.Piponnier & Mane, pp. 114‚Äì15. Many aspects of clothing in the period remain unknown. This is partly because only the wealthy were buried with clothing; it was rather the custom that most people were buried in burial shrouds, also called winding sheets.Piponnier & Mane, p. 112. Fully dressed burial may have been regarded as a pagan custom, and an impoverished family was probably glad to keep a serviceable set of clothing in use.Piponnier & Mane, pp. 10‚Äì11. Clothes were expensive for all except the richest in this period. Materials Shoulder-clasps for an Anglo-Saxon king of the 7th century, found at Sutton Hoo Apart from the elite, most people in the period had low living standards, and clothes were probably home-made, usually from cloth made at a village level, and very simply cut. The elite imported silk cloth from the Byzantine and later Muslim worlds, and also probably cotton. They also could afford bleached linen and dyed and simply patterned wool woven in Europe itself. But embroidered decoration was probably very widespread, though not usually detectable in art. Most people probably wore only wool or linen, usually undyed, and leather or fur from locally hunted animals. Archaeological finds have shown that the elite, especially men, could own superb jewellery, most commonly brooches to fasten their cloak, but also buckles, purses, weapon fittings, necklaces and other forms. The Sutton Hoo finds and the Tara Brooch are two of the most famous examples from the Ireland and Britain in the middle of the period. In France, over three hundred gold and jewelled bees were found in the tomb of the Merovingian king Childeric I (died 481; all but two bees have since been stolen and lost), which are thought to have been sewn onto his cloak.University of Chicago article and picture; Large picture from Gallica Metalwork accessories were the clearest indicator of high-ranking persons. In Anglo-Saxon England, and probably most of Europe, only free people could carry a seax or knife, and both sexes normally wore one at the waist, to use for all purposes. Decoration Both men's and women's clothing was trimmed with bands of decoration, variously embroidery, tablet-woven bands, or colourful borders woven into the fabric in the loom.Owen-Crocker, Gale R., Dress in Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 309‚Äì15.√òsterg√•rd, Else, Woven into the Earth: Textiles from Norse Greenland The famous Anglo-Saxon opus anglicanum needlework was sought-after as far away as Rome. Anglo-Saxons wore decorated belts. Male dress King Lothair I is shown in a cloak fastened on one shoulder worn over a long-sleeved tunic and cross-gartered hose, c. 850 The primary garment was the tunic ‚Äî generally a long fabric panel, folded over with a neck-hole cut into the fold, and sleeves attached. It was typical for the wealthy to display their affluence with a longer tunic made of finer and more colorful cloth, even silk or silk-trimmed. The tunic was usually belted, with either a leather or strong fabric belt. Depending on climate, trousers were tailored either loose or tight (or not worn at all if the weather was warm). The most basic leggings were strips of cloth wound round the leg, and held in place by long laces, presumably of leather, which is called cross- gartering. This may have been done with loose-fitting trousers also. Tighter- fitting hose were also worn. Over this a sleeved tunic was worn, which for the upper classes gradually became longer towards the end of the period. For peasants and warriors it was always at the knee or above. For winter, outside or formal dress, a cloak or mantle completed the outfit. The Franks had a characteristic short cape called a \\"saie\\", which barely came to the waist. This was fastened on the left shoulder (so as not to impede sword strokes) by a brooch, typically a fibula and later a round brooch on the Continent, and nearly always a round one for Anglo-Saxons, while in Ireland and Scotland the particular style of the penannular or Celtic brooch was most common. In all areas the brooch could be a highly elaborate piece of jewellery in precious metal at the top of society, with the most elaborate Celtic brooches, like the Tara Brooch and Hunterston Brooch, perhaps the most ornate and finely made of all. The \\"cappa\\" or chaperon, a one-piece hood and cape over the shoulders was worn for cold weather, and the Roman straw hat for summer fieldwork presumably spread to the invading peoples, as it was universal by the High Middle Ages. Shoes, not always worn by the poor, were mostly the simple turnshoe ‚Äì typically a cowhide sole and softer leather upper, which were sewn together, and then turned inside out. Charlemagne The biographers of Charlemagne record that he always dressed in the Frankish style, which means that he wore similar if superior versions of the clothes of better-off peasants over much of Europe for the later centuries of the period: No English monarch of the time had his dress habits recorded in such detail. The biographers also record that he preferred English wool for his riding-cloaks (sag√¶), and complained to Offa of Mercia about a trend to make cloaks imported into Frankia impractically short. A slightly later narrative told of his dissatisfaction with the short cloaks imported from Frisia: \\"What is the use of these pittaciola: I cannot cover myself up with them in bed, when riding I cannot defend myself against wind and rain, and getting down for Nature's call, the deficiency freezes the thighs\\".... ad necessaria natur√¶ tibiarum congelatione deficio: quoted in H. R. Loyn, Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest, 2nd ed. 1991:88‚Äì89.. It should be noted, however, that he was six foot four inches tall. Clergy At the beginning of this period the clergy generally dressed the same as laymen in post-Roman populations; this changed completely during the period, as lay dress changed considerably but clerical dress hardly at all, and by the end all ranks of clergy wore distinctive forms of dress. Clergy wore special short hairstyles called the tonsure; in England the choice between the Roman tonsure (the top of the head shaved) and the Celtic tonsure (only the front of the head shaved, from ear to ear) had to be resolved at the Synod of Whitby, in favour of Rome. Wealthy churches or monasteries came during this period to use richly decorated vestments for services, including opus anglicanum embroidery and imported patterned silks. Various forms of Roman-derived vestment, including the chasuble, cope, pallium, stole, maniple and dalmatic became regularised during the period, and by the end there were complicated prescriptions for who was to wear what, and when. To a large extent these forms of vestment survive today in the Catholic and (even more conservative) Anglican churches. The same process took place in the Byzantine world over the same period, which again retains early medieval styles in Eastern Orthodox vestments. Secular (i.e. non-monastic) clergy usually wore a white alb, or loose tunic, tied at the waist with a cord (formally called a cincture), when not conducting services.Piponnier & Mane, p. 114. Senior clergy seem always to have fastened their cloaks with a brooch in the centre of their chest, rather than at their right shoulder like laymen, who needed their sword-arm unencumbered.  Female dress  Reconstruction from Kirkleatham Museum of the body of the Street House \\"Saxon Princess\\" in her bed. 7th Century AD, Northumbria, England Women's clothing in Western Europe went through a transition during the early medieval period as the migrating Germanic tribes adopted Late Roman symbols of authority, including dress. In Northern Europe, at the beginning of the period around 400 - 500 AD in Continental Europe and slightly later in England, women's clothing consisted at least one long-sleeved tunic fitted at the wrists and a tube-like garment, sometimes called a peplos, worn pinned at the shoulders. This garment was carried with the Germanic Migrations to Iberia and Southern Europe. These garments could be decorated with metal applique, embroidery, and woven bands. After around 500 AD, women's clothing moved towards layered tunics. In the territories of the Franks and their eventual client tribes the Alemanni and Bavarii, as well as in East Kent, women wore a long tunic as an inner layer and a long coat, closed in the front with multiple brooches and a belt, as an outer layer. An example of this can be seen in the interpretations of the grave of Queen Arnegunde. Not all graves identified as female contain the brooches necessary to close the front of the \\"coat dress\\", indicating that not all women wore that style, or at least that not all women were buried in that style. The brooches may have been too expensive for most women. The women of later Anglo-Saxon England, outside of East Kent, mostly wore an ensemble of multiple layered tunics. These women were particularly well known for their embroidery and may have decorated their clothing with silk and wool embroidery or woven bands. These tunics are often interpreted as having a style of neckline called a \\"keyhole neckline\\" that may have facilitated breast-feeding. This neckline would have been closed with a brooch for modesty and warmth. In later Anglo-Saxon England, there is visual evidence for a large poncho-like garment that may have been worn by noble or royal women. An interpretation of the Scandinavian Apron Dress from Stavanger, Norway The most famous garment of early medieval Scandinavia is the so-called Apron Dress (also called a tr√§gerrock, h√§ngerock, or smokkr). This may have evolved from the peplos of the early Germanic Iron Age. The garment is often interpreted as a tube shape (either fitted or loose) that is worn with straps over the shoulder and large brooches (sometimes called \\"turtle brooches\\") at the upper chest. Examples of appliqued silk bands used as decoration have been found in a number of graves. Not all graves identified as belonging to women contain the brooches that typify this type of garment, indicating that some women wore a different style of clothing. There is evidence from Dublin that at least some Norse women wore caps or other head-coverings, it is unclear however how pervasive this practice was. On all top layers, the neckline, sleeves, and hems might be decorated with embroidery, tablet weaving, or appliqued silks, very richly so for the upper classes. Hose or socks may have been worn on the legs. Veils or other head coverings appear in art depicting northern European women beginning with the Romans, however this is not universal. More pervasive use of headcoverings, especially for married women, appears to follow the Christianization of the various Germanic tribes. Fur is described in many classical accounts of the Germanic tribes but has not survived well in archaeological remains, making it difficult to interpret how and where it was used in female clothing. In all regions, garments were primarily made out of wool and linen, with some examples of silk and hemp. Regional variation Barbarian trousers, from Thorsberg moor, a bog in Northern Germany, carbon- dated to the 4th century, though in terms of style they could come from any point in the following thousand years. Areas where Roman influence remained strong include most of Italy except the North, South-Western France, as far north as Tours, and probably cities like Cologne in Germany. Iberia was largely ruled by the Moors in the later part of the period, and in any case had received rather different influences from the Visigoths compared to other invading peoples; Spanish dress remained distinctive well after the end of the period. The Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse also ruled the South and West of France for the first two centuries of the period. Early Anglo-Saxon women seem to have had a distinctive form of tubular dress, fastened on the shoulder with brooches, and belted. This style matches some German dresses from much earlier in the Roman period. After about 700, which roughly coincides with the general conversion to Christianity, they adopted the general Continental style.Payne, p. 148. The pagan Vikings, especially the women, dressed rather differently from most of Europe, with uncovered female hair, and an outer dress made of a single length of cloth, pinned with brooches at both shoulders. Under this they wore a sleeved undergarment, perhaps with an intervening wool tunic, especially in winter, when a jacket may have been added as a final top layer.Payne, p. 153.

Apartment 4A in this apartment house was the home of Duke Ellington (1899-1974), the noted African American composer and jazz pianist, from 1939 through 1961. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Description and history The apartment house containing the Duke Ellington House is located in northern Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood, at the southwest corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and 157th Street. It is a six-story masonry structure, built in 1915 in the Late Gothic Revival style. The ground floor appears as a raised basement, with horizontal bands of stonework between its windows. The middle four floors are essentially identical, with some columns of window bays featuring decorative carved panels between the floors. Top- floor windows are set in peaked-arch openings and have more elaborate surrounds. The building is crowned by a parapet with stone turrets and projections. A pair of entrance bays are located at the center of the St. Nicholas facade, the entrances deeply recessed in peaked-arch openings. When Duke Ellington moved into Apartment A4 in this building in 1939, he was already a well-known musician with a national reputation. It was during his period of his residency here that he wrote a number of his most important compositions, including Black, Brown and Beige, his first major extended- length jazz composition for chorus and orchestra. During this period, Ellington's music and personal style had a major impact on African-American culture specifically, as well as broader cultural trends in music.

Built between 1903 and 1906, it represents an instance of one of John D. Rockefeller's largest scale efforts at philanthropy, and housed the nation's first major biomedical research laboratory. Construction costs for Founders, which included an Animal housing facility and a powerhouse were $276,000. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. The building is now mainly used for school offices. Description and history Founder's Hall is located near the center of the campus of Rockefeller University on Manhattan's Upper East Side, between the end of 66th Street and FDR Drive. It is a steel-framed five story building, its exterior finished in gray brick with limestone trim. It has Classical Revival styling, with broad pilasters separating groups of window bays, and an entrance with a portico supported by Ionic columns. It was built in 1903 to a design by the architectural form Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge. John D. Rockefeller (1839‚Äì1937) amassed one of the greatest fortunes of the late 19th century in the oil business, from which he retired in 1897. His efforts at philanthropy were formally guided from 1891 by Frederick T. Gates, a Baptist minister who had previously (1889) recommended to Rockefeller that he establish the University of Chicago. Much of Rockefeller's early philanthropy was on a comparatively small scale, and it was soon clear that larger-scale endeavors needed to be organized to properly guide his charitable giving. Gates suggested to Rockefeller that he establish a medical research institute that would be on a par with major European institutions of the period. In June 1902, Rockefeller made a commitment of $1 million to establish such an institute. In 1903 he purchased the former Schermerhorn estate, which is now the university's core campus. Founder's Hall was one of the first three buildings on the campus, housing its principal research laboratories.

Shen Quanqi is especially known for his work in developing and perfecting the regulated verse form of Classical Chinese poetry. Shen's poetry ranges from the elegant court style of the poetry which he wrote while at court and the intensely anguished poems which he wrote during his years of exile, in the extreme south of the empire. Life He was born in the prefecture of Neihuang in the province of Xiangzhou, which is known today as the province of Henan. In 675, Shen Quanqi obtained a magistrate degree. He then served several positions as a scholar at the imperial court, and was appointed by the government official Zhang Yizhi. However, the Wuzhou Dynasty was overthrown, and Zhang Yizhi was executed. Shen Quanqi was arrested and imprisoned on charges of bribery and corruption. He was then released, but sent in exile to Huanzhou of Annan Duhufu, which is known today as Vinh in Vietnam. In 706, he was pardoned, and recalled to resume his duties at the imperial court, where he eventually worked up to the position of imperial diarist and then grand secretary. Works He made numerous contributions to Chinese poetry, including the Five-verse poems (). He was also known to write together with poet Song Zhiwen, and the two were known as the \\"Shen-Song\\" () pair. Due to his exile to Annan (today known as Vietnam), he wrote numerous poems in the region. Many of his poems written there are some of the earliest literary works concerning Vietnam.

Crompton.Rieppel, Olivier. Evolutionary Theory and the Creation Controversy, p. 190 (Springer, 2010). The creature lived during the Early Jurassic period, about 200 million years ago. It was carnivorous and small, slightly smaller than Thrinaxodon, which was under long.Crompton, A.W. \\"Masticatory Function in Non-Mammalian Cynodonts and Early Mammals\\" in Functional Morphology in Vertebrate Paleontology, p. 64 (J. Thomason, ed., Cambridge University Press 1997). Diarthrognathus possesses a jaw structure that is similar to both mammals and more basal synapsids. Its primitive jaw joint is located between the quadrate and articular bones, and its derived, mammalian jaw joint is located between the squamosal and dentary bones.Prothero, Donald. Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters, p. 278 (Columbia University Press, 2013). The articular and quadrate bones evolved to become two of the middle-ear bones in mammals.The Mesozoic Era: Age of Dinosaurs, p. 183 (Britannica Educational Publishing, Rosen Publishing Group, 2010). The transition exemplified by Diarthrognathus suggests that natural selection favored animals with a more powerful bite.\\"How Animals Got Their Bite\\", New Scientist, p. 146 (July 18, 1963). At one time, Diarthrognathus was thought to be synonymous with Pachygenelus. However, in 1980, newly discovered fossils revealed sufficient differences to warrant separate genera.Martinelli, Agust√≠n and Bonaparte, Jos√©.\\"A new tritheledontid (Therapsida, Eucynodontia) from the Late Triassic of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) and its phylogenetic relationships among carnivorous non-mammalian eucynodonts\\", Ameghiniana, Vol. 42, p. 191 (2005). The double jaw joint of Diarthrognathus neatly bridges early synapsids and mammals, and thus rebuts a claim by creationists, such as Duane Gish, who thought such a transition was impossible.Kitcher, Philip. Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism, p. 111 (MIT Press 1982). This \\"twin-jointed jaw\\" can also be seen in other late cynodonts, as well as in early mammaliforms.Colbert, Edward and Morales, Michael.

Juveniles have paler and browner upper parts than adults, with white-edged feathers. Head, neck and breast are dark-streaked. The underparts are white with pale brown streaks, mainly on belly and thighs. Subadults may be all dark grey-brown without any streak on underparts. The eyes, ears, and legs are yellow. They have crested chests.  Habitat  Western banded snake eagles live in woodlands, mainly along rivers, but they avoid dense forests.  Behaviour  Western banded snake eagles mainly hunt snakes, but also other small vertebrates, ambushing from a perch. They drop from the perch to trunk, foliage or ground. They are solitary birds, and very secretive. Due to their sedentary lifestyle, they are often detected only by their calls. The western banded snake eagle sometimes rises to soar, while it calls above the canon. They utter a loud, high-pitched 'kok-kok-kok- kok-kok'.  Geographic range  They are found in Africa in the northern tropics from Senegal and Gambia east through to Ethiopia and then south to southern Angola and Zimbabwe, mostly west of the Rift Valley, but are mostly absent from the western lowland equatorial forests. They inhabit woodland and forest edges. This is an uncommon bird which is often difficult to spot. Its distribution is patchy and it is vulnerable to loss of its riverine habitat. It feeds primarily on reptiles and amphibians which it captures either on the ground or in trees.  Reproduction The western banded snake eagle nests among creepers and foliage, making a new nest every year. It builds a small stick-nest, well concealed within vegetation. The female lays only one egg. Incubation may last between 35 and 55 days, mainly by the female. The young fledge from the nest after 10 to 15 weeks.

Bigend is the antihero of Gibson's Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2010). In an interview Gibson says \\"I've always had a sense of Bigend as someone who presents himself as though he knows what's going on, but who in fact doesn't. It's just my sense of the subtext of the character: he's bullshitting himself, at the same time as he's bullshitting all of us.\\" Character history=Pattern Recognition Bigend's appearance is compared by the protagonist of Gibson's Pattern Recognition to that of actor Tom Cruise \\"on a diet of virgins' blood and truffled chocolates\\". Cruise pictured here at the 2007 London Film Festival. Bigend is introduced in Pattern Recognition as the charismatic founder of the fictional \\"viral advertising\\"/coolhunting agency Blue Ant, from the perspective of protagonist Cayce Pollard: Bigend hires Pollard to track down the source of haunting film fragments known as \\"the footage\\" that have been appearing anonymously online, though she loathes him and suspects that his motivation is mercenary; the exploitation of the art as a marketable commodity. Bigend and Blue Ant benefit from Pollard's work both by the discovery of the origin of the footage and by a relationship he establishes with a Russian oligarch. In Spook Country, it is revealed that Bigend successfully harnesses the footage to sell shoes. Spook Country Gibson did not anticipate Bigend appearing in Spook Country, but realised when writing about a non-existent magazine named Node‚Äîcharacterized as a European version of Wired‚Äîthat it was \\"way Bigendian\\". Thus, Bigend appears as the backer of the ethereal magazine. Again seeking out the origin of a new artwork (in this instance locative), Bigend hires protagonist Hollis Henry for the ostensible purpose of writing a magazine article on it. Of Bigend, Henry is told that \\"he doesn't want you to have heard of him\\". To sate her curiosity, Henry accesses his fictional Wikipedia entry: The book also reveals that the correct pronunciation of \\"Bigend\\" is \\"bay-jhan\\", though this is seldom used even by Bigend himself.Spook Country Chapter 13: Boxes, page 62 Zero History Bigend again featured prominently in Zero History, Gibson's 2010 follow-up to Spook Country, again as the employer of Hollis Henry. In it, he wears a suit in the color International Klein Blue which he likes because it is a color that cannot be represented on most computer monitors.  Critical impression  Bigend is described by Times Union reviewer Michael Janairo as a \\"hyper-connected, ever curious, multigazillionaire\\", and by biopunk writer Paul Di Filippo as amoral and egocentric. Other appellations include \\"imperious\\" (SFGate), \\"enigmatic\\" (St. Louis Post-Dispatch), \\"pontifical Belgian ad mogul\\" (The Village Voice), \\"filthy-rich man-behind-the-curtain\\" (Seattle Times), \\"untrustworthy corporate spiv\\" (The Guardian), \\"accentless Machiavellian fixer with unnervingly white teeth\\" (New Statesman), and \\"information-sucking android-like advertising guru and godgame magus\\" (John Clute, Sci Fi Weekly). Academic Alex Wetmore identified a parallel between the relationships of Bigend and Cayce Pollard and that of Case, the protagonist of Gibson's Neuromancer (1984) and the entity which recruits him, characterizing both Bigend and Case's recruiter as \\"mysterious and potentially untrustworthy\\". Wetmore observes that Bigend \\"espouses a curiously communal and transnational approach to marketing\\" compared to that of the money-hungry dot-commers whose frontier individualism the corporate universe has rejected in favour of the Bigendian approach. The character of Bigend thus represents for Wetmore \\"a shift in the nature of capitalism and, consequently, a change in the way postindustrial technologies deployed by capitalism interact with the self.\\" Footnotes Spook Countrys Node was the inspiration for the real-life literary project Node Magazine.

He is the first base coach for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Twins. In he served as manager of the Twins' Double-A affiliate, the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League, after almost a decade as a coach in the Twins' farm system. Hometown favorite Watkins was drafted by the Twins in the 38th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft from Riverdale High School in Fort Myers, Florida, and was a fan favorite during his two-year stint with the Twins high A affiliate, the Fort Myers Miracle (2002‚Äì2003). Watkins' popularity with Miracle fans translated into one of the more interesting promotions in minor league history when he was the subject of the \\"Tommy Watkins Bobble-Butt\\" late in the 2003 season. It was while with the Miracle that Watkins became more of a utility player. In 2002, he made 41 appearances at shortstop, 33 at third base, 19 at second base and three in the outfield. In 2003, he made his debut as a first baseman (8 times), and played all three outfield positions (38 total appearances), as well as making 28 appearances at third, 17 at shortstop, and nine at second. MLB debut Watkins hit eight home runs his second season with the triple-A Rochester Red Wings to match his minor-league career high of eight home runs in 2004 with the New Britain Rock Cats (Double-A). Also in 2007, he reached a career high in batting average (.272), doubles (22) and RBIs (49). The Twins promoted Watkins on August 8, 2007, from Triple-A Rochester. Twins general manager Terry Ryan announced his call-up while visiting the Red Wings; the news was very well received by his teammates. Watkins spent ten years in the minors, all with the Twins, before making his major league debut. Red Wings Manager Stan Cliburn stated that Watkins' promotion to the big leagues \\"was one of the most emotional call-ups [he had] ever been involved with.\\" The announcement \\"set off a joyous celebration in the clubhouse, because of everyone's love, passion and respect for Tommy.\\" Watkins was the 14th player from the Red Wings to be promoted to the Minnesota Twins in 2007. He was with the Red Wings in Rochester, New York and joined the Twins in Kansas City, Missouri. Watkins made his major league debut on August 10, 2007. He recorded his first major league hit August 15, 2007, while playing the Seattle Mariners. He is the first player in Twins history to wear No. 61. According to Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, \\"He has a good smile in his face and comes to play every day. You can play anywhere you put him, outfield, infield, so it will be fine to have him up there.\\" Watkins played nine games, with his major league debut being as pinch-hitter, August 10 against the Los Angeles Angels. He started the remaining eight games he appeared in, all at third base (he shifted to shortstop for the last two innings of one game). His first hit was a single off Jarrod Washburn on August 15 at Seattle. He had ten hits in 28 at-bats, all of them singles. He scored two runs; his first on a Torii Hunter grand slam. His Major League journey ended on August 22 when he suffered a lower abdominal muscle strain. Coaching Watkins spent all of 2008 with Rochester, where he batted .219 with one home run and 18 RBIs in 76 games. He became a free agent at the end of the season, and in January 2009, he re- signed with the Twins. Watkins was batting .254 at Rochester when he accepted a coaching job in the Twins organization. He helped coach the Gulf Coast League Twins, managed by Jake Mauer, and Class A Fort Myers during home games for the remainder of the season, and in 2010, accepted a position as Batting Coach with the Midwest League's Beloit Snappers. With the transfer from Beloit Snappers to the Cedar Rapids Kernels, batting coach Tommy Watkins continued his tenure with the Twins Organization. After the 2018 season, the Twins named Watkins their major league first base coach.

It is also known as the butterbun, the Caribbean longsnout butterflyfish, or Poey's butterflyfish. This species should not be confused with the banded longsnout butterflyfish (Chelmon rostratus). Scientific name Felipe Poey, the accepted binomial authority for the longsnout butterflyfish The longsnout butterflyfish was first described in 1860 by two scientists: Felipe Poey y Aloy and Albert C. L. G. G√ºnther. Between them the fish was given three separate scientific names each one in a different genus. It was again described in 1880 by Sauvage who gave it yet another scientific name. Description An average of long, the longsnout butterflyfish is commonly known for its namesake long snout that is much more distinctive than those of similar species. They also have a dusky to yellow colored stripe that runs almost vertically from the top of the head to the eyes (unlike the stripes on other butterflyfishes which extend past the eyes). The upper half of the longsnout butterflyfish is yellow that changes to orange and again darkens to brownish-orange. The dorsal fin of the fish is usually black. Habitat and range Fairly common throughout its range, the longsnout butterflyfish is found on natural and artificial reefs, usually in depth, off Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Caribbean Sea, and off the coast of Venezuela. Behavior Longsnout butterflyfish are much more solitary than many other members of their family. They also inhabit deeper reefs and spend much of their time foraging in recesses for invertebrates. It is also known to eat the tube feet of sea urchins and tube worm tentacles. Unlike many other members of its family, the longsnout butterflyfish does not pick parasites from other fish.

Plot Paul Hogan plays Lightning Jack Kane, a long-sighted Australian outlaw in the American west, with his horse, Mate. After the rest of his gang is killed in a robbery-gone-wrong, Jack survives only to read of the events in the newspaper that he was nothing next to others. Annoyed at not being recognised as an outlaw, Jack attempts a robbery by himself, and ends up taking young mute Ben Doyle (Cuba Gooding Jr.) as a hostage. He later discovers that, tired of never having been treated with respect due to his disability, Ben wishes to join him. Jack attempts to teach Ben how to fire a gun and rob banks, with his first attempt at \\"on-the-job\\" training ending with Ben shooting himself in the foot. Across the course of the training, they pay occasional visits to saloons where Jack shows Ben the truth about adult life, including helping him to lose his virginity. However, the true nature of the saloon visits is for Jack to make contact with showgirl Lana Castel (Beverly D'Angelo), who, unbeknownst to Jack, is madly in love with him. When Ben's training is complete, the two learn of a bank which is said to have the entire town armed and ready to protect it. Jack sees this as the test he has been waiting for, and together they hatch a plan to rob it. Everything seems to be going smoothly and they are set to begin, until Jack discovers that a rival gang of outlaws is also planning to rob the bank. He is prepared to give up when Ben has a plan of his own. Ben silently tips off the townspeople, who quickly swarm the bank with the rival outlaws inside. The gang are arrested and the entire town celebrates, allowing Jack and Ben to slip unnoticed into the bank and swiftly strip it clean. Before leaving, Jack jumps into the celebrations, ensuring that his grinning face is seen at the top of the town photo. By the time the true robbery is discovered, the two - and Lana - are gone, with a bounty of thousands on their heads and all of America searching for them - the life that Jack had always wanted.

Coles *Max Cullen as Bart  Production  Paul Hogan wanted to make a classic Western and he was attracted to the idea of making a movie about a bank robber.\\"Interview with Simon Winceer\\", Signis, 8 May 1995 accessed 21 November 2012 Hogan created a company, Lightning Ridge Ltd, which he then floated on the Australian Stock Exchange to help fund the film through investors buying stock. Hogan raised funds this way in order to maintain creative control over the film. The company was delisted in 2001. Filming took place in Santa Fe, NM; Tucson and Page, AZ; Moab, Utah; and Colorado with some interiors shot at Movie World Studios on the Gold Coast in Australia. Director Simon Wincer says making the film was a logistical nightmare because there were so many other westerns filming on the same locations at the same time, such as Wyatt Earp, Geronimo, City Slickers 2 and Tombstone.Scott Murray, \\"Simon Wincer\\", Cinema Papers, April 1994 p4-8 Major League Baseball pitcher Roger Clemens makes an uncredited cameo appearance as the eye-patched outlaw character \\"Dutch Spencer\\". Reception Lightning Jack got poor reviews from critics, as it holds a 6% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Box office The film opened at #2 behind Guarding Tess and grossed less than $17 million.

The album was released by Fonovisa after Iglesias had left them, and signed a deal with Interscope, who promptly sued Fonovisa for using the song \\"Bailamos\\", when it was recorded on their label.Bailamos: Greatest Hits: Amazon.co.uk: Music Despite the title of Greatest Hits, the album contains mostly album tracks that were never released as singles. \\"Nunca Te Olvidar√©\\" and \\"Esperanza\\" were both hits for Iglesias, but appear here as radically altered remixes. Also included on the album was the then rare recording of the English version of \\"S√≥lo En Ti\\". Despite the album not being endorsed by Iglesias or his management, the album sold reasonably well, going Gold in the United States and going on to sell over a million copies worldwide. The album was released during the period in which Iglesias was recording his English debut album, and it has been speculated that many bought the album mistakenly thinking that it was his English crossover album, an understandable mistake given the album shared its main title with Iglesias's first English crossover hit. The album does not contribute to Iglesias' official record sales and is considered apocryphal by some fans. After this release, Fonovisa released another compilation album, the properly titled The Best Hits, which contained Iglesias' best performing Spanish-language singles at the time, but it was quickly removed from shelves due to the substantially larger sales of Bailamos Greatest Hits. The album has sold 500,000 copies in U.S and 1,000,000 copies worldwide.

Sir Ian Fife Campbell Anstruther, of that Ilk, 8th Baronet of Balcaskie and 13th Baronet of Anstruther, Hereditary Carver of the Sovereign, Hereditary Master of the Royal Household in Scotland, Chief of the Name and Arms of Anstruther FSA (11 May 1922 ‚Äì 29 July 2007) was a baronet twice over. He inherited substantial property interests in South Kensington and wrote several books on specialised areas of 19th-century social and literary history. Early life Ian Anstruther was born in Buckinghamshire the younger son of Douglas Tollemache Anstruther and his first wife, Enid (n√©e Campbell). His father was the son of Harry Anstruther, an MP, himself a younger son of another MP, Lieutenant Colonel Sir Robert Anstruther, 5th Baronet. His maternal grandfather was Lord George Campbell, younger son of the 8th Duke of Argyll. His father served in the Army and then worked for the London and South Western Railway. His parents spent 14 years in divorce and then custody proceedings from 1924, and so he spent much of his youth with his mother's sister, Joan Campbell, at Strachur House in Argyllshire\\"Sir Ian Anstruther\\" - The Scotsman, 13 August, 2007 and her London house in Bryanston Square in London. His father's sister, aunt Joyce, better known as Jan Struther, created Mrs. Miniver. Education and military career He was educated at Eton, and joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1939 when the Second World War broke out. An amateur radio ham, he was quickly transferred to the Royal Corps of Signals, and was commissioned, ending up as a Captain. He read Natural Sciences at New College, Oxford, from 1940 to 1942, before returning to Catterick to train for the invasion of France. He landed with his brigade in Normandy three weeks after D-Day, and took charge of a team of signallers. After the war, he chanced to meet Sir Archibald Clerk Kerr, a family friend, on a bus in London. Kerr (later 1st Baron Inverchapel) had been ambassador in Moscow during the war, and had just been appointed British ambassador to the United States; he asked Anstruther to become his private secretary. Anstruther readily agreed, and spent four years in America in the Diplomatic Service. He moved to Paris in 1951, to advance his ambition to become a writer. He met Geraldine Horner, elder daughter of Captain Gerald Stuart Blake, and they were married on 7 March 1951. They had one daughter Emily who later married Simon Crosby. The baronet was divorced in 1963, and he married the architect Susan Margaret Walker daughter of Colonel St John Bradling Paten on 15 November 1963. They had two sons and three daughters. The eldest Sir Sebastian inherited the title and estates in 2007. In 1992 he married a Thai girl, Pornpan Pinthwong known as Goy. Their first child, Maximillian was born in 1995. They still live on the Barlavington estate. Sir Ian was surprised to inherit an estate in South Kensington (including Thurloe Square and Alexander Square) from his aunt Joan in 1960, making him wealthy. He had bought a country estate at Barlavington, on the north of the South Downs near Petworth in West Sussex, in 1956, including of woodland, farmland and downland. He also bought a house near St. Tropez in 1973. As a writer He wrote eight books, including I Presume (1956), a biography of the journalist H. M. Stanley; an account of the Eglinton tournament entitled The Knight and the Umbrella (1963); The Scandal of the Andover Workhouse (1973), exploring the iniquities of the workhouse system; a biography of Oscar Browning (1983), Coventry Patmore's Angel (1992), on Coventry Patmore and his wife Emily, and his poem The Angel in the House; and a book about Sir Richard Broun, The Baronets' Champion (2006). He also wrote about Frederic William Farrar and his novel Eric, or, Little by Little. He undertook much of his research in the London Library in St James's Square. He donated funding in 1992 to enable it to build a new wing, which was named the Anstruther Wing. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and a member of the Royal Company of Archers. Personal life He enjoyed cars, owning an Aston Martin DB6, a Maserati, and several Porsches, but disliked excessive speed, and was occasionally stopped by the police for driving too slowly. He later traded down to a smart car. He succeeded his cousin Sir Ralph Anstruther, 7th Baronet, in 2002, inheriting two Anstruther Baronetcies ‚Äì of Nova Scotia, of Balcaskie (1694) and of Anstruther (1700). His cousin had been hereditary Carver to the Sovereign in Scotland, but the office passed instead to his second son, Toby. He also believed (almost certainly incorrectly) that he held the British baronetcy of Anstruther (1798), but its remainder (to \\"heirs-male of the body legitimately begotten\\" of the grantee) would have made it extinct on the death of Sir Windham Carmichael-Anstruther, 11th Baronet, in 1980, as most reference books, such as Burke and Debrett, have noted. As an adult, he adhered to a fixed routine. He habitually wore a bow tie in the day, and a cravat in the evening. He walked each day in the South Downs, lunching at one of five village pubs during the week, always drinking ginger beer. He took tea at 5pm, and ate supper 8.30pm. He always dressed for dinner in a velvet suit and silk cravat, before his two Martinis. His family knew that matters were serious when he failed to dress for dinner a few weeks before his death. He died at Barlavington. He was survived by his daughter from his first marriage, and two sons and three daughters from his second marriage. Due to differences between English law and Scottish law, one son, Sebastian (born prior to his parents' marriage), inherited the Scottish title, becoming 9th Baronet of Balcaskie and 11th Baronet of Anstruther (both being Nova Scotia or Scottish Baronetages). Obituaries to Sir Ian noted, erroneously, that the Great Britain Baronetcy of Anstruther (1798) had passed to his other son Toby (born after Sir Ian's second marriage).

When it was built, the house faced Isaac Brokaw's 1891 Gothic mansion across the street on the northeast corner, at 1 East 79th. When Fletcher died in 1917, he left the house and his art collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art,Correspondence with Edward Robinson, 1917, Box 5, Folder 6, in the Durr Friedley Records (1906-1918), The Metropolitan Museum of Art Archives. which sold the house to create the Fletcher Fund for purchases of prints and drawings. The purchaser in 1918 was the self-made oil millionaire Harry F. Sinclair, who lived in the house until 1930. Sinclair is best known for founding Sinclair Oil in 1916 and was made notorious by his involvement in the Teapot Dome scandal in 1922. After Sinclair sold it in 1930 it became known as the Augustus and Anne van Horne Stuyvesant House; the unmarried brother and sister, descendants of Peter Stuyvesant, had moved from their house at 3 East 57th Street, when that stretch of Fifth Avenue had become unalterably commercial.Gray 1996. Since 1955 it has been owned by the Ukrainian Institute of America. In 1996 architectural historian Christopher Gray quoted an anonymous critic writing for the Real Estate Record & Guide in 1899, who in praising the design noted that much of the ornament was ecclesiastical in origin rather than domestic. The writer closed with the observation that the Fletcher mansion had \\"too much the air of an archeological reproduction to be accepted as an appropriate New York City house of 1898.\\" It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978, and remained \\"refreshingly unrestored\\", according to Christopher Gray, until 1997, when modest renovations were undertaken.

The Institute was created to conduct basic and applied research in computer science, covering a broad range of research topics of interest to the aerospace community including supercomputing, computational fluid dynamics, computational chemistry, high performance networking, and artificial intelligence. Since its inception, a goal of the Institute‚Äôs research has been to support scientific research and engineering from problem formulation to results dissemination, combining concurrent processing systems with intelligent systems to allow users to interact in the language of their discipline. This goal has since expanded to support a broad range of activities associated with space exploration and science, including mission operations and innovative information systems for technology research and development. An underlying philosophy and approach of the Institute is that successful research is interdisciplinary, and that challenging applications associated with NASA‚Äôs mission provide a driving force for developing innovative information systems and advancing computer science. To implement this approach, research staff undertakes collaborative projects with research groups at NASA, integrating computer science with other disciplines to support NASA‚Äôs mission. Over its nearly twenty five-year history, RIACShttp://www.riacs.edu has acted as a bridge between academia and government research, engaging talented researchers from around the world to collaborate with NASA on challenging research topics. RIACS has also acted as a bridge between industry and the government to mature information technologies for infusion into NASA operations, enabling broader public benefit from research results. For NASA, RIACS has collaborated most closely with the Intelligent Systems Division and the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS) at the NASA Ames Research Center ‚Äì NASA‚Äôs Center for Excellence in Information Technology. RIACS, which was formed the same year as the NAS, worked closely with the division in its early years to develop a strong competency in supercomputing and computational fluid dynamics at NASA. RIACS helped establish the Intelligent Systems Division, and has since collaborated closely with the division to develop and infuse a number of software innovations in the areas of autonomous systems; intelligent information management and data understanding; and human-centered computing.  Historical Contributions to NASA  Examples of RIACS contributions to NASA Ames as part of the \\"Intelligent Systems Divisions\\" include leadership roles in developing and infusing: * Autoclass Bayesian discovery system ‚Äì used probabilistic techniques to discover new classes of infra-red stars in the Low Resolution Spectral catalogue from the NASA IRAS mission as the first artificial intelligence program to make an astronomical discovery; also used to discover new classes proteins, introns, and other patterns in DNA/protein sequence data, and others; * Livingstone model-based diagnostic system ‚Äì flown on Deep Space One as part of Remote Agent and on Earth Observing Mission EO-1 as the first artificial intelligence control system to control a spacecraft without human supervision; * MAPGENhttp://www.riacs.edu/research/projects/mapgen tactical activity planner ‚Äì a constraint-based planning system used everyday during the Mars Exploration Rover mission resulting in an estimated 20% increase in scientific return; * Clarissa voice-operated procedure browser ‚Äì used on the International Space Station as the first spoken dialogue system used in space; and * Program Management Toolhttp://www.riacs.edu/research/projects/pmt ‚Äì used to manage billions of dollars of NASA programs and projects with case studies showing 85% reduction in financial reporting time, elimination of 40% discrepancy rates in non- advocate review milestone data, and elimination of 30% error rates in baseline project plans.  Purpose and Charter  The stated purpose of RIACS since its formation is to: * Provide an interface between the NASA Ames Research Center and the academic community and serve as a center of cooperation for activities conducted in areas of advanced computer science and engineering, applied mathematics, and the application of computers to NASA‚Äôs scientific and engineering challenges. * Conduct independent research activities with the objective of developing concepts, techniques, or prototypes in computationally related disciplines to enhance problem-solving capabilities in scientific and engineering fields of interest to the aerospace community. * Improve cooperative research efforts of government, industry, and academia toward the solution of problems requiring advanced computational facilities. * Enhance technology transfer between universities, industry and other government agencies by conventional means, including encouragement of the rapid dissemination of preprint reports by institute personnel, presentations at symposia and publications in appropriate journals. * Strengthen ties between the general academic and industrial communities and NASA‚Äôs Ames Research Center to further develop in-house programmatic activities in computer science and technology. * Carry out a variety of additional activities, including lecture programs and visiting scientist programs, as well as provide consultation and collaboration with NASA Ames on topics in the fields of computer science and applied mathematics. RIACS personnel may lend support to local universities through the direction of dissertations, service on research committees, and participation in research seminars. * Engage and leverage an eminent Science Council appointed by USRA to review progress of RIACS, including its research, reports, publications, and other matters that would affect or influence the purpose of the Institute. The Science Council also advises the RIACS Director on research projects, priorities, and resource requirements, and reports to USRA on the scientific activity of the Institute.

Apartment 3F in this building is where Matthew Henson (1866-1955), the African American polar explorer, lived from 1929 until his death. Henson was arguably the first man to reach the Geographic North Pole, a feat that is disputed in part by his own diary. His residence was named a National Historic Landmark in 1975. and Description and history 246 West 150 Street is located in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, on the south side of the street east of Frederick Douglass Boulevard. It is part of the Dunbar Apartments complex, an innovative tenant- owned cooperative housing complex erected in the 1920s. Its residents over the decades have included a significant number of African Americans important to culture and society. Apartment 3F was occupied by Matthew Henson from 1929 until his death in 1955. Matthew Henson was born in 1866 to free people of color in Maryland. He met Commander Robert E. Peary in 1887, who hired him for exploratory expeditions after learning of seagoing experiences he had as a teenager. Henson became an indispensable figure in the expeditions Peary led into the Arctic Ocean, assisting with the planning and logistics, as a translator with the local Inuit people, and frequently as a groundbreaker in the party's movements. In 1909, as he was assigned the task of breaking trail in Peary's bid to reach the Geographic North Pole. The expedition claimed success in this attempt, although later analysis (based in part on descriptions contained in Henson's diary) of the available evidence suggests they actually fell short of the objective. Although Henson was denied the accolades showered upon Peary after the expedition, he was eventually honored with membership in The Explorers Club in 1937, and was lauded within the African-American community for his achievement, and has since been recognized at both national and state levels. A plaque marking his achievements is located outside one of the Dunbar building entrances.

Riddle was defeated in the Republican primary by Valoree Swanson of Spring, Texas, who then claimed the seat in the general election held on November 8, 2016. Committees * Calendars * Energy Resources * Juvenile Justice and Family Issues (Vice-Chair) Significant legislation In the Eightieth Texas Legislature, Riddle authored House Bill 8, which was the Texas version of Jessica's Law. The bill was signed into law by Governor Rick Perry on June 15, 2007 and became effective on September 1, 2007. In the same session, she authored House Bill 1034, which added the words \\"one state under God,\\" to the Texas State Pledge. Transgender bathroom bill In the 84th Texas Legislature in 2015, Representative Riddle authored House Bill 1748, which would have jailed or fined transgender persons for using public restrooms (and other public facilities) that did not fit their birth chromosomes. The bill read as: \\"For the purpose of this section, the gender of an individual is the gender established at the individual's birth or the gender established by the individual's chromosomes. A male is an individual with at least one X chromosome and at least one Y chromosome, and a female is an individual with at least one X chromosome and no Y chromosomes. If the individual's gender established at the individual's birth is not the same as the individual's gender established by the individual's chromosomes, the individual's gender established by the individual's chromosomes controls under this section.\\" http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill;=HB1748LegSess=84R&Bill;=HB1748 The bill also would have fined or jailed business owners for allowing the usage of restrooms that did not match the transgender person's birth chromosomes. The bill died quickly at the beginning of the legislative session. Pit of hell speech In a March 6, 2003 interview with the El Paso Times, Riddle was quoted: \\"Where did this idea come from that everybody deserves free education, free medical care, free whatever? It comes from Moscow, from Russia. It comes straight out of the pit of hell. And it's cleverly disguised as having a tender heart. It's not a tender heart. It's ripping the heart out of this country.\\" \\"Legislators Question Border Health\\", El Paso Times; March 6, 2003 The quote came after a Border and International Affairs Committee meeting during the Seventy-eighth Texas Legislature, in which the state faced a budget deficit of $10 billion, and was linked to a discussion Riddle had during the hearing regarding proposed health care cuts. The witness claimed that health care cuts would cause serious damage to border area hospitals, which Riddle countered with the claim that illegal immigrants were responsible for the financial strains. Riddle was further quoted as saying \\"In a perfect world, I think it would be wonderful to open our doors to any and all, young and old, for health care. But this isn't a perfect world. We have got to decide if we are going to just open our borders for any and all that come through for health care, education, and services.\\" The comment was met almost instantly with both opposition and support from both ends of the political spectrum. Texas Democrats claimed the statement was bigoted and \\"the product of an antipathy toward non-Anglo inhabitants of the state\\" and the Harris County Democratic Party called for her to resign from her position on the Border Affairs Committee.Harris County Democratic Party - Message From The Chair: April 2003 The Mexican American Legislative Caucus stated that \\"Our constitutional mandate comes not from the pit of hell. It comes from our state's forefathers.\\"The Austin Chronicle: News: Naked City: Beyond City Limits At the same time, the Unidas Hispanic Women's Club and the Republican National Hispanic Assembly of Harris County praised Riddle for the quote and honored her at a dinner at the conclusion of session. Reggie Gonzalez, chairman for the Republican Hispanic Outreach Committee of Harris County said in a press release: \\"The liberal opposition to Representative Riddle's comments offends me as a Hispanic citizen. Their opposition only strengthens this negative stereotype of Hispanic immigrants, by implying that they need a lower standard of accountability. This implication is detrimental to the cause of Mexican-Americans everywhere.\\"Texas House of Representatives House voting procedures Riddle has defended the Texas House's unwritten policy to cast votes for absent and indisposed members on the basis that members of the legislature often do not get breaks to tend to any other business. She was shown on Austin's KEYE-TV voting for State Representative Edmund Kuempel. She has defended the House policy: \\"We have a lot of votes. We have a lot of amendments, and there's [sic] times when we don't break for lunch, and we don't break for dinner, we don't have bathroom breaks.\\". Terror babies Riddle made the claim on Anderson Cooper 360 that Middle Eastern women were coming to the United States to give birth and were then returning to their home countries to raise their babies as terrorists who also retain American citizenship.

Her father was a businessman, and she says her childhood was a prosperous and happy one. She attended Queens High School in Kingston. But while in her Sixth form, her father's business began to fail. She dropped out of school to go to work and support the family. \\"Sometimes I left home without breakfast; I never had the lunch money and when I got home, I was not sure that I would see dinner,\\" she has said.Rose, \\"Helene Davis-Whyte - Enjoying the Union,\\" Jamaica Gleaner, 7 August 2007.

In 1995 she married Frederick Whyte, a former commissioner of the Jamaica Fire Brigade, and had a second child. Union career In the early 1980s Davis-Whyte worked at the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation. \\"I was probably one of the most anti-union persons\\" working in local government, she admitted. But when a new mayor promised to lay off members of her department, she and other workers decided to ask for JALGO's assistance. During a meeting with then-general secretary E. Lloyd Taylor, Davis-Whyte became the speaker for the group. Her co-workers were so impressed with her representation of their issues that they elected her a delegate to JALGO, and she became increasingly involved in union work. Davis-Whyte was elected vice-president of JALGO's Municipal Branch, and in 1984 was elected the national union's education officer.

He was born in Liverpool, the son of Willoughby Gaspard Weiss Esq., a professor of flute and a music publisher. He studied under Sir George Thomas Smart and Michael Balfe.Dictionary of National Biography Weiss made his operatic debut in Dublin in 1842 as Oroveso, and in London at the Prince's Theatre at that time as Count Rodolfo in La sonnambula.H. Rosenthal and J. Warrack, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, (OUP, London 1974). H. F.

The book recently went into its sixth edition, published by Random House. 2,000,000 books were sold and is credited with starting a grassroots movement among women. History Derived from a set of booklets published in the 1920s and 1930s by the Psychological Press, the book seeks to help traditionally-minded women to make their marriages \\"a lifelong love affair\\". According to Time magazine, Andelin wrote Fascinating Womanhood when \\"she felt her own marriage wasn't the romantic love affair she had dreamed of.\\" The book's self-published edition sold over 400,000 copies, and since being published by Random House, the book has sold more than 2 million copies. including foreign markets. It has been translated into seven languages. The book serves as a touchstone for those of the anti-feminist persuasion. Sources The book takes many of its sources from historical women and from examples provided in classic literature. One of the \\"real life\\" women, Mumtaz Mahal of Taj Mahal fame, is cited as one of the ideal women who possessed both an angelic and a human side. More sources come from classic literature: Amelia (the original domestic goddess) of William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair, Agnes and Dora from David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, and Deruchette from Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea. Fascinating Womanhood movement Although the book was published in the early 1960s when second wave feminism became part of the American mainstream, Fascinating Womanhoods traditional explication of happy marriage resonated in the minds and hearts of millions of women. By 1975, according to Time magazine, the movement included 11,000 teachers, and over 300,000 women had taken the series of Fascinating Womanhood classes. Unlike other antifeminism movements of the 1960s and 1970s, the Fascinating Womanhood movement continues today. The now-deceased Andelin maintained a website that received over a quarter of a million visits. The classes continue in Namibia, The Philippines, Japan, and Malaysia, and in the United States in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Utah, and Virginia. Academic attention Fascinating Womanhood has gained the attention of feminist writers, who largely regard the book as detrimental to women in various ways. In 1978, psychologist Martha L. Rogers wrote an article (\\"Fascinating Womanhood as a Regression in the Emotional Maturation of Women\\") positing the argument that women who follow the book's teachings were doing so out of a fear of being self-actualized individuals. Juanne N. Clarke of Wilfrid Laurier University wrote that the movement used Kanter's Model of Commitment Mechanisms to analyze the techniques used to gain women's allegiance. More recently, Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons, by Lynn Peril, cited Fascinating Womanhood as part of a body of literature that seeks to promote \\"an idealized version of womanhood\\".Peril, page 215 Finally, communications writer Julia Woods discusses the Fascinating Womanhood movement in Gendered Lives: Communication, Gender, and Culture.

(2007): Morphology and Functional Anatomy. In: Pinto-da-Rocha et al. 2007: 17f Examples of this suborder include Hadrobunus grandis (Sclerosomatidae), Phalangium opilio and Dicranopalpus ramosus (Phalangiidae). Distribution Caddoidea are mostly found in temperate zones of both hemispheres; however, they are known from the Palearctic only from Japan, and from Baltic amber (about 40 million years old). One species known from Japan is also found in North America, where several more species are found. Other species occur in Southern South America, Venezuela, New Zealand and Australia. Neopilionidae show a Gondwanan distribution, with species found in South America, South Africa and Australia. Sclerosomatidae are divided into several subfamilies, with Gagrellinae found in the Indo-Malayan and neotropical region, Gyinae at high elevations in the Caucasus, Alps and Nepal, Leiobuninae in the holarctic region down to Costa Rica, and Sclerosomatinae only in the Palearctic. In the Phalangiidae, the Phalangiinae are most diverse in the Mediterranean, with several endemic genera in nearby coastal Africa. Although there are several Phalangiinae in the Nearctic, they are all introduced. Opilioninae are mostly palearctic, with a few species found in Southeast Asia. Oligolophinae are holarctic, with most species found in Europe. Platybuninae are also found from Europe to the Caucasus, with one find from Sumatra. (2007): Phylogeny and Biogeography.

Their names were adapted from the names \\"Sidney\\" and \\"Floyd\\", which Jay Ward said were the most boring names ever. (Gidney is also an actual surname indigenous to New England and neighboring areas of Canada. Cloyd is both an actual surname and a given name‚Äîsee former major league baseball player Cloyd Boyer as well as current major league baseball player Tyler Cloyd.) Gidney and Cloyd are \\"Moon Men\\", inhabitants of Earth's Moon. They are essentially humanoid, but are depicted as about half the height of the average adult Earth human. Although the narration of the series describes them as \\"green men,\\" their color varies from scene to scene (including other colors such as orange, tan, and blue). Their skin has black spots, or in some scenes, circles. Their pudgy bodies are pear-shaped. Their onion-shaped heads are bald, save for tufts of hair at the very tops. They have no noses (Cloyd remarks that they have no sense of smell because of this) and they have no visible external ears. Cloyd displays a toothy smile; whatever mouth Gidney may have is concealed by a shaggy mustache. Cloyd wears a belt and holster for his scrootch gun (which has the power to immobilize its targets for a variable length of time). They are otherwise unclothed. Both Gidney and Cloyd possess the ability to disappear and reappear at will; they can disappear completely, but at times their eyes, and/or Cloyd's mouth, may remain visible (in the manner of the Cheshire cat's smile), though any equipment they carry, such as Cloyd's scrootch gun, remain visible even when they vanish fully. The Moon Men appeared in Jet Fuel Formula, the first Rocky and Bullwinkle story arc, broadcast 1959-1960. In this story they come to Earth in an attempt to thwart a rush of tourists to the Moon, only to become media celebrities themselves. They initially succumb to the temptations of fame but soon tire of it. (In Cloyd's words, \\"It's all so wonderful we can't STAND it anymore!\\") With the help of Rocky and Bullwinkle, they are eventually able to get home. Gidney and Cloyd return in the second-season story arc Metal-Munching Mice and in the third-season story arc Missouri Mish Mash. Cloyd was voiced by legendary voice actor Paul Frees in the original series and is voiced by Rachel Butera in the 2018 series. Gidney was voiced by Bill Scott; although Scott was credited as a producer and writer for the series, he was uncredited for his voice work, which included Bullwinkle, Fearless Leader and Dudley Do-Right as well as Gidney. In 2018 series, Gidney is voiced by Ben Diskin In the 2018 reboot The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Gidney and Cloyd are related in this version as father and son. Cloyd is also a child in the reboot. Unlike the original series, they don't speak English.

It is also identified as Castrum Rubrum mentioned in Latin texts. The castle stands in the village of Yahmur, at 12 kilometres' distance from Tartus and 10 kilometres from Safita, where the Tortosa and Chastel Blanc Crusader castles can be found.  History  Little is known about the capture and early development of the place by the Crusaders. This is because it was a castle of secondary importance, and also to some doubts in identifying the castle in medieval sources. However, it was granted by Tancred to Pons, Count of Tripoli in 1112. Later on, the stronghold seems to be in the hands of a Frankish family, the Montolieu, vassals of the Counts of Tripoli. Thus, it was part of the network of castles defending the County, for example Crac des Chevaliers, Chastel Blanc and Areimeh. In 1177/78, Raymond III transferred the stronghold to the Hospitallers, and the Montolieus were given 400 bezants as compensation. In 1188, Saladin attacked the stronghold and destroyed it. The Crusaders could most probably retrieve it and keep it until they lost the County one century later, during the reign of Mamluk sultan Qalawun in 1289.  Description of the place  The village of Yahmur is located in the coastal plain between Tartus and Tripoli. Consequently, Chastel Rouge did not possess natural defences, as many other castles did. The stronghold consists in a two- floor donjon, 16 metres long and 14 metres wide, enclosed in rectangular outer walls of 42 metres' length and 37 metres' width, with towers on the north- western and south-eastern angles. The first floor was divided in two storeys by a wooden floor that does not exist any more. Upper floors can be reached through stairs running along the walls inside and outside the donjon. The construction cannot be dated with exactitude, however two main phases can be recognised: the first phase dates from the beginning of the 12th century and includes the outer walls, while the donjon was built at the beginning of the 13th century. Excavations in the stronghold also found ruins date back to the Phoenician era, in addition to inscriptions from the Greco-Roman period.

The band first played at Trax a few months after forming in 1991. Because their local and regional popularity grew, they secured a standing gig at Trax every Tuesday night from late 1992 through the end of 1993.dmbalmanac.com has detailed information about the club and every Dave Matthews Band performance there. The band became a national touring act on the verge of mainstream stardom by early 1994, so they only played at Trax four times after 1993. Trax originally was an industrial building adjacent to the CSX train tracks (thus the name). The building also housed a country and western nightclub called Max. The complex was located along 11th Street SW near the University of Virginia and also included John Hornsby's original Music Resource Center for kids. With a capacity of around 900 people, Trax played host to Florida based band Spider Monkey, Cinderella (band), Seven Mary Three, Juliana Hatfield, Widespread Panic, George Clinton, Ziggy Marley, Sonic Youth, They Might Be Giants, The Pixies, The Ramones, The Black Crowes, Southern Culture on the Skids, Phish, Shawn Colvin, and other popular acts in the early 1990s. Before Ratdog, Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead and Rob Wasserman played there as part of a Native American benefit organized by musician, Pete Sears . The benefit also featured Jorma Kaukonen, Michael Falzarano, Pete Sears, Chris Whitley and Dave Mathews. But after the rise of the legal drinking age and the decision by operator Coran Capshaw to spend more time with Dave Matthews Band, whom he managed, the venue fell into a slump. It was taken over by David Fisher in the early nineties for a brief period and then experienced a resurgence under Dana Murphy in the mid nineties, nurturing an ever growing music scene at the time. Earth to Andy frequented the club as well as My Dog Lucy, whose former guitarist would later join Daughtry.

Career Prior to his arrival in Southern California, Whittington was a popular radio personality in the San Francisco Bay area at Oakland's KROW (960 AM), where he hosted the Night Watchman overnight program, and, later, a weekday afternoon show, from 1955 to 1958. In the fall of 1958, he moved to KSFO (560 AM) in San Francisco, as host of the 9 p.m. to midnight program. He began his stint in Los Angeles at KABC 790 AM, doing a one-hour talk show weekdays and a 3-hour Sunday talk show from 1965-69. His greatest fame in the Los Angeles market came after he moved in 1969 to the morning drive time slot at KGIL AM 1260 in the \\"Sin Fernando Valley\\". For a brief time, he left KGIL to do the evening drive time slot at KFI AM 640. He was briefly heard in the late 1980s on KIEV (870 AM) and, for a few months in 1989, was back at KABC AM. Many people regard his broadcast style as being ahead of its time. Rather than the \\"happy morning to you\\" type of radio personality, he often spoke on the air about things that bothered him and foreshadowed the Howard Stern era of speaking your mind. At stations where he was still spinning records, he would many times interrupt a song midway through saying, \\"I like it up to that point, then I get bored.\\" He was an ensemble member of the top-rated TV series Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1968-69 season). One of Whittington's notable film roles was as the disc jockey in the TV movie Duel, Steven Spielberg's directorial debut. He can also be seen briefly as a ring announcer in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull.

Howard, formerly Mystic C and Caviare, is a wooden Fredonia schooner built in 1893 in Essex, Massachusetts, USA.South Street Seaport Museum This type of craft was commonly used by American offshore fishermen, and is believed to be the last surviving example of its type. She was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989. She is now based at the South Street Seaport Museum in New York City. Description and history Lettie G. Howard is a two-masted wooden-hulled fishing schooner. She is long, with a beam of and a hold depth of . She has a gross tonnage of 59.74 and a net tonnage of 56.76. Her hull has a frame of oak timbers, covered in treenailed pine planking. The belowdecks area was historically divided into a forecastle third where the crew quarters were located, the main fish hold in the center, and a smaller storage area aft. The schooner was built in 1893 at a shipyard in Essex, Massachusetts by noted shipbuilder Arthur D. Story. Story was one of four co-owners of the ship, which operated on the Georges Banks until 1901, when she ran aground on a shoal near Gurnet Point, Massachusetts. In 1902, she was sold to E.E. Saunders of Pensacola, Florida, who used her to fish for red snapper off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. She was taken out of service in 1922, and rebuilt in 1923, given the name Mystic C. In 1966, she was sold to Historic Ship Associates of Gloucester, Massachusetts, who converted her into a museum ship, mistakenly named Caviare after an 1891 ship of that name. That museum failed, and in 1968 she was sold to the South Street Seaport Museum and refinished. She was restored in 1991 and is currently certified by the US Coast Guard as a Sailing School Vessel training and working museum ship. She currently sails along the Northeast seaboard. She underwent extensive shipyard repairs in Portland, Maine in the second half of 2013.Old Salt Blog - Lettie G.

It is exclusive to people who live or have lived in southeast Asia.  Presentation Presentation can be atypical and without pain or fever, especially in the elderly. Positive symptoms include biliary colic, acute pancreatitis, obstructive jaundice and less commonly, liver enlargement and abnormal liver function tests. Additional complications in the acute setting include ascending cholangitis, gallbladder empyema, clotting within the hepatic and portal veins, sepsis and death. Chronic biliary obstruction may cause jaundice, itchiness, liver abscesses, and cirrhosis, particularly at the left lobe segment 3, and can eventually lead to intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm or cholangiocarcinoma. Pathogenesis With RPC, the gallstones found within the biliary system are made of calcium bilirubinate or pigmented calcium. Calcium bilirubinate stones are prevalent in Asia and very rare in Europe and the United States. They tend to be friable concretions of various shapes and sizes within the biliary tree, and their associated bile is often muddy in consistency and contains numerous fine particles of calcium bilirubinate as well. This differs greatly from cholesterol stones, which are common in Europe and the United States. The formation of calcium bilirubinate stones in RPC has been attributed to a high incidence of infection with Escherichia coli in bile. In humans, the majority of bilirubin is excreted in the bile as bilirubin glucuronide. Hepatolithiasis is associated with Clonorchis sinensis and Ascaris lumbricoides infestation of the liver. This theory is based on high incidence of dead parasites or ova within stone in autopsy findings. Diagnosis The diagnosis can be suspected by imaging, with typical characteristics centering around appearance of the liver, typically with CT, ultrasound or MRI. Traits that raise suspicion for the infection include intra- and extra- hepatic dilatation and strictures with intraductal pigmented stones, usually in the absence of gallstones and with regions of segmental liver atrophy, particularly the lateral aspect of the left hepatic lobe. There is also reduced arborization of peripheral ducts. Approximately 5% of chronic infections go on to develop cholangiocarcinoma. Pathogenic bacteria responsible for the infection include E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Proteus species. Anaerobes are a less frequent cause, and a culture positive for multiple strains can be common. When related to Clonorchis sinensis, definitive diagnosis is by identification of eggs by microscopic demonstration in faeces or in duodenal aspirate, but other sophisticated methods have been developed, such as ELISA, which has become the most important clinical technique. Diagnosis by detecting DNAs from eggs in faeces are also developed using PCR, real-time PCR, and LAMP, which are highly sensitive and specific. Treatment The treatment of RPC involves management of sepsis during episodes of cholangitis with antibiotics, abscess drainage, and blood pressure support. With resistant infection, a surgical hepatectomy or hepaticocutaneousjejunostomy can be performed. Lifelong surveillance for malignancy is also usually necessary.

A collar is an ornate chain, often made of gold and enamel, and set with precious stones, which is worn about the neck as a symbol of membership in various chivalric orders. It is a particular form of the livery collar, the grandest form of the widespread phenomenon of livery in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period. Orders which have several grades often reserve the collar for the highest grade (usually called the Grand Cross). The links of the chain are usually composed of symbols of the order, and the badge (also called \\"decoration\\", \\"cross\\" or \\"jewel\\") of the order normally hangs down in front. Sometimes the badge is referred to by what is depicted on it; for instance, the badge that hangs from the chain of the Order of the Garter is referred to as \\"the George\\". History The first of the Orders of Knighthood were the military orders of crusaders who used red, green or black crosses of velvet on their mantles, to distinguish their brotherhoods. Later the members of knightly orders used rings, embroidered dragons and even garters as the symbol of their order. In the late Middle Ages the knights wore their insignia ever more prominently and medaillons, crosses and jewels in the shape of animals began to be worn on chains around the neck, known as livery collars. After the 17th century the heyday of the collar was over. They were worn only on ceremonial occasions and replaced in daily life by stars pinned to the breast, and badges suspended from ribbons. Many orders retained their collars and when orders were divided into several ranks or grades the collar was usually reserved for the highest rank. The notable exception is Portugal. Charles VIII of France, wearing the collar of the Order of Saint Michael. Collars of various devices are worn by the knights of some of the European orders of knighthood. The custom was begun by Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, who gave his Knights of the Golden Fleece badges depicting a golden fleece hung from a collar of flints, steels and sparks. Following this new fashion, Louis XI of France, when instituting his Order of St. Michael in 1469, gave the knights collars composed of scallop shells linked on a chain. The chain was doubled by Charles VIII, and the pattern underwent other changes before the order lapsed in 1830. At the end of the 18th century most of the European orders had only one rank; that of Knight and although they usually had collars, the cross or badge was now worn on a ribbon around the neck or over the right shoulder. When the orders became more democratic several ranks were introduced and only the highest grade, the \\"Grand Commanders\\" or \\"Grand Crosses\\", wore collars. The Netherlands never had collars but several Belgian, most of the Austrian and Prussian orders, and several Portuguese orders had collars. In Portugal all the members of these orders of knighthood wear a collar but the collars of the Grand Cross are more elaborate. Sometimes the collar is used as the insignia of office of the Grand Master of the order. For instance, the President of France wears the collar of the Order of the Legion of Honour. In other countries such as Brazil the collar is a rank above that of a Grand Cross and it is reserved for the president and foreign heads of state. Napoleon I introduced the Grand aigle (Grand Eagle) to replace the Grand Cross as the highest rank in his Legion of Honour. Napoleon dispensed 15 such golden collars of the Legion among his kinsmen and the highest of his ministers. This collar did not survive his downfall and was abolished in 1815. Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, his arms at left are surrounded by the Collar of the Order of St Michael. Until the reign of Henry VIII, the Order of the Garter, most ancient of the great knightly orders, had no collar. But the Tudor king wished to match the continental sovereigns in all things, and the present collar of the Garter knights, with its golden knots and its buckled garters enclosing white roses set on red roses, has its origin in the Tudor age. Most of the British orders of knighthood have collars and they are still worn on special occasions (see Collar days). The Distinguished Service Order, the Order of Merit, the Order of the Companions of Honour and the Imperial Service Order are the exceptions. Heraldry In heraldry, most members of orders are permitted to display the collar of their order on their coat of arms (if they are in fact entitled to wear the collar). There are often very strict rules as to how exactly the collar is to be displayed. Normally it will entirely encircle the escutcheon (shield), or the collar may be partially hidden by it. Sometimes, only a part of the collar and the badge will extend below the escutcheon. Collars of different orders are often depicted in the heraldic achievement of various monarchs, encircling the escutcheon. Though the standard achievement used most often may depict specific collars, this does not preclude the use of or substitution with other collars to which someone may be entitled to. Some achievements depict multiple collars while others depict only one; The coat of arms of the Norwegian monarch only depicts the collar of the Order of St. Olav encircling the shield while that of Denmark's depicts the collars of the nation's two chivalric orders: the Order of the Elephant and the Order of Dannebrog. In the greater arms of Sweden, the collar of the Order of Seraphim is used. The collar of the Order of Leopold is also depicted in the national arms of Belgium. Death of recipient When a member of an order dies, they are not usually buried with the collar, but it may be displayed on a pillow placed on the coffin (along with other decorations that the member may have) during the funeral. Many orders require that after the death of a member of the order, the collar and perhaps other insignia be returned to the issuing authority. Often, the requirement is that a male relative personally return the award to the order. Orders with Collar as a separate (highest) rank Many orders also do have a chain as an ornament that is worn at more official ceremonial occasions (worn by knights of a single class order or members of the highest class of a multi-class order). However, in some orders Collar is a separate rank above that of Grand Cross, i.e.:  Europe  * : Collar of the Order of Charlemagne * : First Class with Collar of the Order of the White Lion

There are four basic types of highlights: foil highlights, hair painting, frosting, and chunking. Highlights can be any color, as long as it's a lighter level than the surrounding hair. Hair lightened with bleach or permanent color will be permanent until new growth begins to show. Highlighted hair can make the hair appear fuller. Therefore, it is sometimes recommended for people with thin and fine hair. It also a recommended service for achieving better color balance with people that have at least 50% gray, and it also helps to diminish the line of demarcation once the new growth is showing from permanent hair color.  Basic foil highlighting  Foil highlighting is the process of using foil to separate strands of hair which will be lightened from strands of hair which will remain its natural color. The process is done by applying lightener to the hair that has been woven and separated using an applicator brush. The foil is then folded to protect the hair and surrounding area during the \\"processing\\" time. This is the amount of time required to achieve the desired results. In highlighting hair, hydrogen peroxide mixed with pigment is used to change the color of the strand. This process is also used in applying \\"lowlights\\" to the hair. In this process, hair dyes are used to create strands of hair that are darker than the natural color.  Hair painting  Coloring a young girl's hair with temporary spray paint Hair painting is a method of highlighting hair that uses free handed technique to achieve a highlighted effect. Hair painting methods are permanent and employ a hair-painting brush. Foils, plastic wrap, paper, or cotton may be used to separate lightened hair from non lightened hair. While brushes are commonly used in hair painting, one may also use combs to paint or highlight thin-sized strands of hair. *Balayage (from the French, meaning \\"scanning, sweeping\\") is a technique of free-form painting on clean, styled hair. The results are subtle, and thus more natural- looking than foiling or chunking. Balayage in its many variations is currently trending in Hollywood. *Leopard hair highlights, or leopard hair print, consist in creating hair highlights with a leopard pattern. The process to create leopard spots effects can be realized first bleaching in spots a hair tuft and then coloring with a brown tint the external parts of the bleached spots. It is even common to use funky and eccentric colors for this effect. This kind of hair process started as urban Street fashion as new trend, in fact is often combined with weird haircuts. Gallery and How to Leopard hair print. It is possible to apply the leopard hair print both on long hair tuft or on shaven head parts. Another similar motif used for spot hair highlight is the cheetah hair pattern.  Frosting  Frosting a process of lightening trends of hair while leaving the adjacent hairs untreated. A highlighting cap may be used with this technique. Hair is pulled through holes in the cap and that hair is then lightened. The effects of this can give the hair a look that is \\"salt and pepper\\" with a decent amount of hair left untreated. It will create a stark contrast between the colors and will usually not resemble natural highlights. This is a popular technique for those with shorter hair.  Chunking  Chunking is a style of highlight which is larger and thicker than a traditional highlight, rather than to a method of creating highlights. Chunky highlights are generally offered in a wider variety of bold natural colors, as well as a large number of artificial, or unnatural, colors and are used to create more contrast, rather than subtle texture, as in traditional, thinner highlights.  Safety concerns  It Is recommended that these services be performed by a licensed professional to achieve desired results. It is always important to read all of the manufacture's directions on any chemical applied to the skin or hair. The FDA bans the use of hair dyes for eyelash and eyebrow tinting or dyeing even in beauty salons.

He is primarily known for his role in bringing detailed maps of Central Asia to Europe after close to two decades in captivity. Early Career and Russian Captivity Renat was the son of Dutch Jewish immigrants to Sweden, who took Swedish nationality in 1681, the year before his birth. During the Great Northern War against Russia, he served in the army of Charles XII as a warrant officer (styckjunkare) in the artillery. He was taken prisoner after the Battle of Poltava in 1709. In 1711 Renat was sent to Tobolsk where many Swedish officers were kept as prisoners of war. He entered Russian service on the condition of not fighting against Sweden. Renat helped produce maps of Siberia for the Russian government. In 1716 Renat and other Swedish prisoners-of-war took part in Ivan Buchholz's expedition to explore the gold deposits around Lake Yamysh on the Irtysh River. The expedition was ambushed by a Dzungar force, and Renat spent the following seventeen years in Dzungar captivity. Dzungarian captivity and return to Sweden In Dzungaria, Renat helped the khans Tsewang Rabtan and Galdan Tseren to organize their campaigns against Qing rule in Central Asia. Among other things, he organized an artillery regiment and helped the Dzungars to cast cannons. Renat also met a Swedish woman who was also a Dzungar captive. This was Brigitta Scherzenfeldt, who hailed from Scania. Twice widowed, she had married a German prisoner who had taken Russian service and been assigned to Siberia. Their convoy was seized by Dzungar raiders in 1716, who killed her husband. She later married Renat. In 1733, Renat and his wife were allowed to leave. They returned the following year to Stockholm, accompanied with four Dzungar female servants, who were baptized when they arrived in Sweden. Renat's family bought a house in Gamla stan where they settled down. In 1739, Renat was promoted to the rank of captain in the Swedish army. The same year, he remarried the industrialist Elisabet Fritz. Central Asian maps Renat brought two detailed maps of Central Asia back to Sweden. But these maps were left in relative obscurity for many years. In 1878, copies of the maps were discovered by the Swedish author August Strindberg, then an assistant librarian at the Swedish Royal Library. He sponsored their republication in Russia in 1881. A decade later the originals were discovered in the library of Uppsala University, where they are still held. Strindberg remained interested in the maps for many years.

One of these was a new system management feature that is very useful for certain types of applications. Under Windows 2000, NTFS 3.0 partitions can be set to keep track of changes to files and directories on the volume, providing a record of when and what was done to the various objects. When enabled, the system records all changes made to the volume in the USN Journal, which is the name also used to describe the feature itself. One journal is maintained for each NTFS volume and stored in the NTFS metafile named $Extend\\\\$UsnJrnl. It begins as an empty file. Whenever a change is made to the volume, a record is added to the file. Each record is identified by a 64-bit Update Sequence Number or USN (for this reason Change Journals are sometimes called USN Journals). Each record in the Change Journal contains the USN, the name of the file, and information about what the change was. The Change Journal describes the changes that took place using bit flags (e.g. USN_REASON_DATA_OVERWRITE), therefore it does not include all the data or details associated with the change.

Forehand Maryland Senate Political career=Transportation Forehand keeps transportation issues \\"on the front burner\\" for citizens and public officials. She serves on the MD-DC-VA Regional Transportation Planning Board overseeing the strategic development and federal funding for the area's rail and roadway development. One key regional transportation roadway, the Inter-County Connector (ICC), has begun construction after years of delay, thanks in no small part to Forehand's unwavering advocacy in the Legislature. Health Forehand also has a passion for health related issues. She played a leading role in making Maryland \\"smoke-free,\\" gaining recognition from the American Cancer Society for her efforts. She was the first State legislator in the nation to propose prohibiting genetic-based discrimination in health insurance and in the workplace. Leveraging her experience on Montgomery County's Health Planning Commission, Forehand's active support for the strategic expansion of local health care resources such as Adventist Hospital ensures that community health care needs are met. As a Director on the Board of Hospice Caring, she helped create this facility, a haven for individuals facing the end of life and their families. A strong advocate for mental health services, Forehand has given many speeches on depression as the result of her mother's recovery from severe clinical depression. She was a \\"founding mother\\" of Rockville's JLG Regional Institute for Children and Adolescents (RICA), a highly regarded, community- based, clinical and educational facility serving those with severe emotional disabilities. Economic development As a legislator, Forehand has a knack for recognizing early on the technologies and trends that will affect her constituents and the State economy.

It is one of the more popular areas for worship and tourism among Asian residents in the Los Angeles area. In addition to Mazu, the temple also venerates the martial deity of justice, Guan Sheng Di Jun (ÈóúËÅñÂ∏ùÂêõ) and the wealth deity Fu De Zheng Shen (Á¶èÂæ∑Ê≠£Á•û). History The temple is affiliated with the Camau Association of America, a local benevolent, cultural and religious association primarily serving the local Chinese-Vietnamese refugees from C√† Mau Province, Vietnam. The group also supports Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai Chinese communities. The original building of the temple was a former Italian Christian church located within what was formerly Little Italy; the building was purchased in the 1980s. Under a strong faith-based community in and outside of Chinatown, the temple was able to raise a great deal of donated money with which to build a larger temple hall. Construction of the new temple was completed and dedicated in September 2005. A new ancestral memorial hall was consecrated the following month. Services Thien Hau Temple is usually festive on the commemoration days of various deities, especially Mazu. On the eve of Chinese New Year, members from various communities gather to receive blessings and to burn incense in worship of the Deities. Lion dance will be performed and firecrackers are popped in order to ward off any evil spirits. Representatives from over 25 family associations headquartered in Chinatown and other communities are present to light the firecrackers at the stroke of midnight. Since the temple is located within the heart of Chinatown, the temple is often seen as the local \\"Times Square\\" to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Many people come to the temple especially during the first week after New Year to receive a blessing for the year. On the concluding day of the New Year celebrations, people come to the temple to pray and beckon Mazu for blessings and protection for the rest of the year. In recent years, a large number of non-Asian visitors have equaled the number of Asian visitors and congregants who assemble at the temple during the New Year celebration. On weekends and the 1st and 15th day of the lunar calendar, food is provided to the general public for free (with the option to give a donation to the temple). The temple also holds a Zhong Yuan Festival ceremony in the summer. In 2020, all services for that year were cancelled for the first time in the temple's history due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Built in 2001 in South Korea by Hyundai Heavy Industries, the rig was commissioned by R&B; Falcon (a later asset of Transocean), date of publication verifiable on http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69685498.html registered in Majuro, and leased to BP from 2001 until September 2013. In September 2009, the rig drilled the deepest oil well in history at a vertical depth of and measured depth of in the Tiber Oil Field at Keathley Canyon block 102, approximately southeast of Houston, in of water. On 20 April 2010, while drilling at the Macondo Prospect, a blowout caused an explosion on the rig that killed 11 crewmen and ignited a fireball visible from away. The fire was inextinguishable and, two days later, on 22 April, the Horizon sank, leaving the well gushing at the seabed and causing the largest marine oil spill in history. Design The Deepwater Nautilus, sister rig to the Deepwater Horizon being transported aboard a heavy-lift ship Deepwater Horizon was a fifth-generation, RBS-8D design (i.e. model type), deepwater, dynamically positioned, column-stabilized, semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling unit, designed to drill subsea wells for oil exploration and production using an , blowout preventer, and a outside diameter marine riser. Deepwater Horizon was the second semi-submersible rig constructed of a class of two, although Deepwater Nautilus, its predecessor, is not dynamically positioned. The rig was and capable of operating in waters up to deep, to a maximum drill depth of . In 2010 it was one of approximately 200 deepwater offshore rigs capable of drilling in waters deeper than . Its American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) class notations were \\"A1, Column Stabilized Drilling Unit, AMS, ACCU, DPS-3\\". In 2002, the rig was upgraded with \\"e-drill\\", a drill monitoring system whereby technical personnel based in Houston, Texas, received real-time drilling data from the rig and transmitted maintenance and troubleshooting information. Advanced systems played a key role in the rig's operation, from pressure and drill monitoring technology, to automated shutoff systems and modelling systems for cementing. The OptiCem cement modelling system, used by Halliburton in April 2010, played a crucial part in cement slurry mix and support decisions. These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on the rig that month. History=Construction and ownership Deepwater Horizon was built for R&B; Falcon (which later became part of Transocean) ‚Äì date of publication verifiable on by Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan, South Korea. Construction started in December 1998, the keel was laid on 21 March 2000, and the rig was delivered on 23 February 2001, after the acquisition of R&B; Falcon by Transocean. Until 29 December 2004 the rig was registered in the Republic of Panama. Transocean, through its Steinhausen, Switzerland subsidiary Triton Asset Leasing GmbH, operated the rig under the Marshallese flag of convenience. The rig was leased to BP on a 3-year contract for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico following construction. The lease was renewed in 2004 for a year, 2005 for 5 years, and 2009 for 3 years covering 2010 to 2013. The last contract was worth $544 million, or $496,800 a day, for a \\"bare rig\\", with crew, gear and support vessels estimated to cost the same. According to R&B; Falcon's filings to SEC in 2001, the transfer document between R&B; Falcon and Transocean was dated 17 August 2001, and the rig was specified as \\"official registration number of 29273-PEXT-1, IMO number of 8764597, with gross tonnage of 32,588 and net tonnage of 9,778\\" and the transfer value as . , the rig was insured for covering the replacement cost and wreckage removal. Drilling operations Deepwater Horizon worked on wells in the Atlantis (BP 56%, BHP Billiton 44%) and Thunder Horse (BP 75%, ExxonMobil 25%) oil fields. It was described at times as a \\"lucky\\" and \\"celebrated\\" rig, and in 2007 was still described as \\"one of the most powerful rigs in the world\\". Alternate link In 2006 it discovered oil in the Kaskida oil field, and in 2009 the \\"giant\\" Tiber oil field. The well in the Tiber field had a true vertical depth of and a measured depth of , below of water. The well was the deepest oil well in the world, and more than further below the seabed than the rig's official drilling specification stated on the company's fleet list. In February 2010, Deepwater Horizon commenced drilling an exploratory well at the Macondo Prospect (Mississippi Canyon Block 252), about off the southeast coast of Louisiana, at a water depth of approximately . The Macondo prospect exploration rights had been acquired by BP in 2009, with the prospect jointly owned by BP (65%), Anadarko Petroleum (25%) and MOEX Offshore 2007 (10%). Deepwater Horizon was still working on the Macondo site on 20 April 2010, when a violent explosion occurred leading to destruction of the rig and the subsequent oil spill. The well was in the final stages of completion after cement had been emplaced for its last casing string. The exploratory work had been described as \\"concluded\\" with permission already having been requested from MMS to terminate operations at the Macondo site. The rig was scheduled to move to its next roles as semi-permanent production platforms, initially at the Tiber site followed by a return to the Kaskida field, an oil dome 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana. During its operational lifetime, the rig was actively in operation for 93% of its working life (2,896 of 3,131 days). The remainder partly was time spent moving between sites.  Regulation, safety, and inspection  The Minerals Management Service (renamed on 18 June 2010 to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOE)) is the regulatory and inspecting body for offshore oil drilling and rigs in the United States of America. According to an Associated Press investigation, certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information, including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred, was absent. The exact number of required monthly inspections performed varied over time; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months, but after that around 25% of inspections were omitted, although the investigation notes this is partly expected, since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an inspection. Reports of the last three inspections for 2010 were provided under Freedom of Information legislation. Each of these inspections had taken two hours or less. During its lifetime the rig received 5 citations for non-compliance, 4 of which were in 2002 (safety, including the blowout preventer) and the other in 2003 (pollution). A sixth citation in 2007 related to non-grounded electrical equipment was later withdrawn when the equipment was determined to be compliant with regulations. Overall the Deepwater Horizon safety record was \\"strong\\" according to a drilling consultant reviewing the information. In 2009 the Minerals Management Service \\"herald[ed] the Deepwater Horizon as an industry model for safety\\". According to AP's investigation \\"its record was so exemplary, according to MMS officials, that the rig was never on inspectors' informal 'watch list' for problem rigs\\". Explosion and oil spill Deepwater Horizon in flames after the explosion At CDT on 20 April 2010, during the final phases of drilling the exploratory well at Macondo, a geyser of seawater erupted from the marine riser onto the rig, shooting into the air. This was soon followed by the eruption of a slushy combination of drilling mud, methane gas, and water. The gas component of the slushy material quickly transitioned into a fully gaseous state and then ignited into a series of explosions and then a firestorm. An attempt was made to activate the blowout preventer, but it failed. The final defense to prevent an oil spill, a device known as a blind shear ram, was activated but failed to plug the well. Eleven workers were presumed killed in the initial explosion. The rig was evacuated, with injured workers airlifted to medical facilities. After approximately 36 hours, Deepwater Horizon sank on 22 April 2010. The remains of the rig were located resting on the seafloor approximately deep at that location, and about (quarter of a mile) northwest of the well. The resultant oil spill continued until 15 July when it was closed by a cap. Relief wells were used to permanently seal the well, which was declared \\"effectively dead\\" on 19 September 2010. Aftermath  Transocean received an early partial insurance settlement for total loss of the Deepwater Horizon of around 5 May 2010. Financial analysts noted that the insurance recovery was likely to outweigh the value of the rig (although not necessarily its replacement value) and any liabilities the latter estimated at up to . Litigation, ultimate roll call of damage, and the scope of final insurance recovery were all unknown , with analysts reporting that the aftermath was of unprecedented scale and complexity compared to previous disasters which themselves took many years to unfold and resolve. A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that \\"at some point the scale of the litigation becomes so large that it really is novel\\", that \\"the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means it will be hard to aggregate them into so-called class actions\\" and that there was \\"no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before\\". As with the Exxon Valdez disaster, litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20-year timescale. In January 2013, Transocean agreed to pay US$1.4 billion for violations of the US Clean Water Act. BP had earlier agreed to pay $2.4 billion but faced additional penalties that could range from $5 billion to $20 billion. In September 2014, Halliburton agreed to settle a large percentage of legal claims against them by paying $1.1 billion into a trust by way of three installments over two years. On 4 September 2014, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ruled BP was guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA). He described BP's actions as \\"reckless,\\" while he said Transocean's and Halliburton's actions were \\"negligent.\\" He apportioned 67% of the blame for the spill to BP, 30% to Transocean, and 3% to Halliburton. BP issued a statement strongly disagreeing with the finding, and saying the court's decision would be appealed. On 8 December 2014, The US Supreme Court rejected BP's legal challenge to a compensation deal over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The settlement agreement had no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (¬£6.1bn) to compensate victims.

This is as a contrast to both additional components such as headings, images, charts, footnotes etc. on each page, and also the pages of front matter that form the introduction to a book. Body text has two slightly different meanings, depending on context. A book designer, concerned with the overall sequence of a book, regards it as those pages that form the majority of a book, containing the body of text or body matter. A typesetter concerned instead with the layout of text on a page sees 'body text' as being those sections of the main text that are flowed into columns or justified as paragraphs, as distinct from the headings and any pictures that are floated out of the main body.  Book design  The 'body matter' is the group of pages that contain the body of the text of the book. The front matter comes before it, containing title pages, content lists, publisher's metadata etc. It is followed by the back matter, which includes appendices, references, credits, colophon etc. The distinction between the parts, body and other, is that the body matter is produced by the author, the front and back matter by the publisher (through the book designer, index collator etc.). Where there is a prose introduction, it demonstrates this; an introduction by the author is considered as body matter, an introduction by an editor or other commentator is placed with the front matter. In some technical publications, appendices are so long and important as part of the book that they are a creative endeavour of the author, rather than a mere collation exercise by the publisher. In this case they may, like the introduction, be considered as a part of the body matter. At one time, books were produced as 'letter-books', where the body of text consisted of chapters of solid text, unillustrated. Where illustrations were provided, these were costly and so plates were inserted in sections, either at the end of the body matter, or grouped within the signatures. Development in printing in the early 20th century, and particularly developments in newspaper design and the incorporation of photographs, encouraged the development of the 'picture-book' where images were mixed in the text and formed part of the body matter itself (although in most cases, this was still outside the paragraphs of the typesetter's body text).  Typesetting  Typesetting of the body text is the work of the printer and their typesetter. Typesetting of the other parts, the front matter, and pages of the body matter involving specific design of their layout are, if budget permits, the remit of the book designer. Typesetting of the body text is generally considered to be rote work: skilled, but not inherently creative. Computer typesetting was thus first applied to body text. This represented the bulk of the work, yet also that part requiring the least human creative input.  Styles  Body text is usually typeset in a serif font, as these are perceived as more readable for text in dense blocks, whilst a sans-serif font is used for the adjacent headings.  Web design  HTML follows the 'book designer's' meaning of body text. There is an HTML element named \`<body>\` that serves to delimit the body matter from the front matter (or in HTML, the \`<head>\`) that contains metadata such as the page title. The typesetting of the web page is carried out by document body elements within this. There is no specific HTML element for 'body text' in the typesetting sense. The block elements of \`<p>\` and \`<div>\` are both used for this, but these elements are used for a great many general markup purposes within HTML and so there is not usually any semantic implication that they always contain 'body'. \`<p>\` would generally be favoured over \`<div>\`.

Ted Nation an activist for several decades beside protest sign Farmington coal mine disaster kills 78 in West Virginia, US The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill discharges Fossil fuel phase-out is the gradual reduction of the use of fossil fuels to zero as part of the ongoing renewable energy transition. Current efforts in fossil fuel phase-out involve replacing fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources in sectors such as transport, heating and industry.  Fossil fuels = Coal  Top 5 coal consuming countries to 2017, US EIA data Castle Gate Plant near Helper, Utah. Coal use peaked in 2013 but to meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to well below coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030. However , coal supplied over a quarter of the world's primary energy and about 40% of the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Phasing out coal has short-term health and environmental benefits which exceed the costs, and without it the 2 ¬∞C target in the Paris Agreement cannot be met; but some countries still favor coal, and there is much disagreement about how quickly it should be phased out. , 30 countries and many sub-national governments and businesses had become members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, each making a declaration to advance the transition away from unabated coal power generation. , however, the countries which use the most coal have not joined, and some countries continue to build and finance new coal-fired power stations. A just transition from coal is supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In 2019 the UN Secretary General said that countries should stop building new coal power plants from 2020 or face 'total disaster'.  Oil  Oil is refined into fuel oil, diesel and gasoline. The refined products are primarily for transportation by conventional cars, trucks, trains, planes and ships. Popular alternatives are human-powered transport, public transport, electric vehicles, and biofuels.  Natural gas  Natural gas is widely used to generate electricity and has an emission intensity of about 500g/kWh. Heating is also a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Leaks are also a large source of atmospheric methane. In some countries natural gas is being used as a temporary \\"bridge fuel\\" to replace coal, in turn to be replaced by renewable sources or a hydrogen economy. However this \\"bridge fuel\\" may significantly extend the use of fossil fuel or strand assets, such as gas-fired power plants built in the 2020s, as the average plant life is 35 years. Although natural gas assets are likely to be stranded later than oil and coal assets, perhaps not until 2050, some investors are concerned by reputational risk. Natural gas phase-out is progressing in some regions, for example with increasing use of hydrogen by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) and changes to building regulations to reduce the use of gas heating.  Basis  The reasons for phasing-out fossil fuels are: the health risks of air pollution, mitigation of global warming, and the falling cost of renewable energy.  Health  Most of the millions of premature deaths from air pollution are due to fossil fuels. Pollution may be indoors e.g. from heating and cooking, or outdoors from vehicle exhaust. One estimate is that the proportion is 65% and the number 3.5 million each year. According to Professor Sir Andy Haines at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine the health benefits of phasing out fossil fuels measured in money (estimated by economists using the value of life for each country) are substantially more than the cost of achieving the 2 degree C goal of the Paris Agreement.  Global warming mitigation  In 2008, James Hansen and nine other scientists published a journal article titled \\"Target atmospheric : Where should humanity aim?\\" which calls for a complete phase-out of coal power by 2030. More recently, Hansen has stated that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change. The letter, co-authored with other climate change experts declared \\"If we stay on the current path,\\" he said, \\"those are the consequences we'll be leaving to our children. The best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power. It's ready now. We need to take advantage of it.\\" and \\"Continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change.\\" Also in 2008, Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen published a peer-reviewed scientific study analyzing the effect of a coal phase-out on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050. The authors describe the scenario as follows: Kharecha and Hansen also consider three other mitigation scenarios, all with the same coal phase-out schedule but each making different assumptions about the size of oil and gas reserves and the speed at which they are depleted. Under the Business as Usual scenario, atmospheric CO2 peaks at 563 parts per million (ppm) in the year 2100. Under the four coal phase-out scenarios, atmospheric CO2 peaks at 422-446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter. The key implications of the study are as follows: a phase-out of coal emissions is the most important remedy for mitigating human-induced global warming; actions should be taken toward limiting or stretching out the use of conventional oil and gas; and strict emissions-based constraints are needed for future use of unconventional fossil fuels such as methane hydrates and tar sands.  Others  The impulse of renewable energy can create jobs through the construction of new power plants and the manufacturing of the equipment that they need, as could be seen in the case of Germany and the wind power industry.  Studies about fossil fuel phase-out  In the Greenpeace and EREC's Energy (R)evolution scenario, the world would eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2090. In December 2015, Greenpeace and Climate Action Network Europe released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across Europe. Their analysis derived from a database of 280 coal plants and included emissions data from official EU registries. A September 2016 report by Oil Change International, concludes that the carbon emissions embedded in the coal, oil, and gas in currently working mines and fields, assuming that these run to the end of their working lifetimes, will take the world to just beyond the 2¬∞C limit contained in the 2015 Paris Agreement and even further from the 1.5¬∞C goal. The report observes that \\"one of the most powerful climate policy levers is also the simplest: stop digging for more fossil fuels\\". In October 2016, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and 11 other NGOs released a report on the impact of building new coal-fired power plants in countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks access to electricity. The report concludes that, on the whole, building coal-fired power plants does little to help the poor and may make them poorer. Moreover, wind and solar generation are beginning to challenge coal on cost. A 2018 study in Nature Energy, suggests that 10 countries in Europe could completely phase out coal-fired electricity generation with their current infrastructure, whilst the United States and Russia could phase out at least 30%. The GeGaLo index of geopolitical gains and losses assesses how the geopolitical position of 156 countries may change if the world fully transitions to renewable energy resources. Former fossil fuel exporters are expected to lose power, while the positions of former fossil fuel importers and countries rich in renewable energy resources is expected to strengthen.  Challenges of fossil fuel phase-out  The phase-out of fossil fuels involves many challenges, and one of them is the reliance that currently the world has on them. In 2014, fossil fuels provided 81.1% of the primary energy consumption of the world, with approximately . This number is composed by of oil consumption; of coal consumption, and of natural gas consumption. Fossil fuel phase-out can lead to an increment in electricity prices, because of the new investments needed to replace their share in the electricity mix with alternative energy sources. Another cause to increasing electricity price comes from the need to import the electricity that can't be generated nationally. Another impact of a phase- out of fossil fuels is in the employment. In the case of employments in the fossil fuel industry, a phase-out is logically undesired, therefore, people in the industry will usually oppose any measures that put their industries under scrutiny. Endre Tvinnereim and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten studied the relationship between employment in the fossil fuel industry with the support to climate change policies. They proposed that one opportunity for displaced drilling employments in the fossil fuel industry could be in the geothermal energy industry. This was suggested as a result of their conclusion: people and companies in the fossil fuel industry will likely oppose measures that endanger their employments, unless they have other stronger alternatives. This can be extrapolated to political interests, that can push against the phase- out of fossil fuels initiative. One example is how the vote of United States Congress members is related to the preeminence of fossil fuel industries in their respective states.  Legislation and initiatives to phase out coal = Major economies  On 8 June 2015, several newspapers ran an article wrote that the leaders of the Group of Seven (or G7, consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) agreed to phase-out fossil fuel use by 2100, as part of the efforts to keep global temperature increase under 2 ¬∞C. This was done as a prelude for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (a.k.a. COP 21) hosted in Paris, on December of the same year.  Africa  South Africa = As of 2007, South Africa's power sector is the 8th highest global emitter of CO2. In 2005/2006, 77% of South Africa's energy demand was directly met by coal, and when current projects come online, this ratio will increase in the near term. There are no plans to phase out coal-fired power plants in South Africa, and indeed, the country is investing in building massive amounts of new coal-fired capacity to meet power demands, as well as modernizing the existing coal-fired plants to meet environmental requirements. On 6 April 2010, the World Bank approved a $3.75B loan to South Africa to support the construction of the world's 4th largest coal-fired plant, at Medupi. The proposed World Bank loan includes a relatively small amount $260 million for wind and solar power. Rated at 4800 MW, Medupi Power Station would join other mammoth coal-fired power plants already in operation in the country, namely Kendal Power Station (4100 MW), Majuba Power Station (4100 MW), and Matimba Power Station (4000 MW), as well as a similar-capacity Kusile Power Station, at 4800 MW, currently under construction. Kusile is expected to come online in stages, starting in 2012, while Medupi is expected to first come online in 2013, with full capacity available by 2017. These schedules are provisional, and may change. Since 2008, South Africa's government started funding solar water heating installations. As of January 2016, there have been 400 000 domestic installations in total, with free-of-charge installation of low-pressure solar water heaters for low-cost homes or low-income households which have access to the electricity grid, while other installations are subsidised.  Americas  Canada = In 2005, Canada annually burned 60 million tonnes of coal, mainly for electrical power, increasing by 15 percent annually. In November 2016, the Government of Canada announced plans to phase out coal- fired electricity generation by 2030. , only four provinces burn coal to generate electricity: Alberta, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan. Canada aims to generate 90% of its electricity from non-emitting sources by 2030. Already, it generates 82% from non-emitting sources. Beginning in 2005, Ontario planned coal phase-out legislation as a part of the Ontario electricity policy. The province annually consumed 15 million tonnes of coal in large power plants to supplement nuclear power. Nanticoke Generating Station was a major source of air pollution, and Ontario suffered \\"smog days\\" during the summer. In 2007, Ontario's Liberal government committed to phasing out all coal generation in the province by 2014. Premier Dalton McGuinty said, \\"By 2030 there will be about 1,000 more new coal-fired generating stations built on this planet. There is only one place in the world that is phasing out coal-fired generation and we're doing that right here in Ontario.\\" The Ontario Power Authority projected that in 2014, with no coal generation, the largest sources of electrical power in the province will be nuclear (57 percent), hydroelectricity (25 percent), and natural gas (11 percent).Ontario Power Authority, Long-Term Energy Plan 2013, module 3, 2014. In April 2014, Ontario was the first jurisdiction in North America to eliminate coal in electricity generation. The final coal plant in Ontario, Thunder Bay Generating Station, stopped burning coal in April 2014. = United States = In 2017, fossil fuels provided 81 percent of the energy consumed in the United States, down from 86 percent in 2000.US Energy Information Administration, Primary energy consumption by source, accessed 5 April 2018 Estimated effect of a carbon tax on sources of United States electrical generation (US Energy Information Administration) Total energy consumption in the US by source: comparing fossil fuels with nuclear and renewable energy US electrical generation: fossil fuels vs. nuclear and renewable energy In 2007, 154 new coal-fired plants were on the drawing board in 42 states.Eco Concern: Coal Plant Boom By 2012, that had dropped to 15, mostly due to new rules limiting mercury emissions, and limiting carbon emissions to 1,000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced. In July 2013, US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz outlined Obama administration policy on fossil fuels: Then-US Energy Secretary Steven Chu and researchers for the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory have noted that greater electrical generation by non-dispatchable renewables, such as wind and solar, will also increase the need for flexible natural gas- powered generators, to supply electricity during those times when solar and wind power are unavailable.April Lee and others, Opportunities for synergy between natural gas and renewable energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Dec. 2012.John Funk, DOE boss says shale gas could benefit wind and solar, Cleveland Plain Dealer, 18 January 2012.

The law was signed in September 2006 by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, took effect for investor-owned utilities in January 2007, and took effect for publicly owned utilities in August 2007. SB 1368 applied to long-term investments (five years or more) by California utilities, whether in-state or out-of-state. It set the standard for greenhouse gas emissions at 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, equal to the emissions of a combined- cycle natural gas plant. This standard created a de facto moratorium on new coal, since it could not be met without carbon capture and sequestration.\\"California Takes on Power Plant Emissions: SB 1368 Sets Groundbreaking Greenhouse Gas Performance Standard,\\" Natural Resources Defense Council Fact Sheet, August 2007.  Maine  On 15 April 2008, Maine Governor John E. Baldacci signed LD 2126, \\"An Act To Minimize Carbon Dioxide Emissions from New Coal-Powered Industrial and Electrical Generating Facilities in the State.\\" The law, which was sponsored by Rep. W. Bruce MacDonald (D-Boothbay), requires the Board of Environmental Protection to develop greenhouse gas emission standards for coal gasification facilities. It also puts a moratorium in place on building any new coal gasification facilities until the standards are developed.Rhonda Erskine, \\"Maine Governor Baldacci Signs Bill to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions,\\" WCSH WCSH6.com, 15 April 2008  Oregon  In early March 2016, Oregon lawmakers approved a plan to stop paying for out-of-state coal plants by 2030 and require a 50 percent renewable energy standard by 2040. Environmental groups such as the American Wind Energy Association and leading Democrats praised the bill.  Texas  In 2006, a coalition of Texas groups organized a campaign in favor of a statewide moratorium on new coal-fired power plants. The campaign culminated in a \\"Stop the Coal Rush\\" mobilization, including rallying and lobbying, at the state capital in Austin on 11 and 12 February 2007.\\"Stop the Coal Rush\\" Rally & Lobby Day Set for February 11 & 12\\" , Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter. Over 40 citizen groups supported the mobilization. In January 2007, a resolution calling for a 180-day moratorium on new pulverized coal plants was filed in the Texas Legislature by State Rep. Charles \\"Doc\\" Anderson (R-Waco) as House Concurrent Resolution 43. The resolution was left pending in committee. On 4 December 2007, Rep. Anderson announced his support for two proposed integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal plants proposed by Luminant (formerly TXU).Rep. Anderson press release , 4 December 2007.  Washington state  Washington has followed the same approach as California, prohibiting coal plants whose emissions would exceed those of natural gas plants. Substitute Senate Bill 6001 (SSB 6001), signed on 3 May 2007, by Governor Christine Gregoire, enacted the standard.Christina Russell, \\"Wallula Coal Plant Proposal Controversial Among Students, Faculty,\\" Whitman College Pioneer, 11/15/07 As a result of SSB 6001, the Pacific Mountain Energy Center in Kalama was rejected by the state. However, a new plant proposal, the Wallula Energy Resource Center, shows the limits of the \\"natural gas equivalency\\" approach as a means of prohibiting new coal plants. The proposed plant would meet the standard set by SSB 6001 by capturing and sequestering a portion (65 percent, according to a plant spokesman) of its carbon.  Utility action in the US  * Progress Energy Carolinas announced on 1 June 2007, that it was beginning a two-year moratorium on proposals for new coal- fired power plants while it undertook more aggressive efficiency and conservation programs.

Asia  China = China is confident of achieving a rich zero carbon economy by 2050. China's exceedingly high energy demand has pushed the demand for relatively cheap coal-fired power. Each week, another 2 GW of coal-fired power is put online in China. Coal supplies about 80% of China's energy needs today, and that ratio is expected to continue, even as overall power usage grows rapidly. Serious air quality deterioration has resulted from the massive use of coal and many Chinese cities suffer severe smog events. As a consequence the region of Beijing has decided to phase out all its coal- fired power generation by the end of 2015. In 2009, China had 172 GW of installed hydro capacity the largest in the world, producing 16% of China's electricity, the Eleventh Five-Year Plan has set a 300 GW target for 2020. China built the world's largest power plant of any kind, the Three Gorges Dam. In addition to the huge investments in coal power, China has 32 nuclear reactors under construction, the highest number in the world. Analysis in 2016, showed that China's coal consumption appears to have peaked in 2014. = India = Coal Production in India, with a 1959-2020 axis (appears to end at 2012) India is the third largest consumer of coal in the world. India's federal energy minister is planning to stop importing thermal coal by 2018. The annual report of India's Power Ministry has a plan to grow power by about 80 GW as part of their 11th 5-year plan, and 79% of that growth will be in fossil fuel‚Äìfired power plants, primarily coal. India plans four new \\"ultra mega\\" coal-fired power plants as part of that growth, each 4000 MW in capacity. , there are six nuclear reactors under construction. In the first half of 2016, the amount of coal-fired generating capacity in pre-construction planning in India fell by 40,000 MW, according to results released by the Global Coal Plant Tracker.Alister Doyle, \\"Global coal power plans fall in 2016, led by China, India: study,\\" Reuters, 6 September 2016 In June 2016, India's Ministry of Power stated that no further power plants would be required in the next three years, and \\"any thermal power plant that has yet to begin construction should back off.\\"\\"India won't need extra power plants for next three years, says government report\\", The Economic Times, 2 June 2016 In cement production, carbon neutral biomass is being used to replace coal for reducing carbon foot print drastically. = Japan = Japan, the world's third-largest economy, made a major move to use more fossil fuels in 2012, when the nation shut down nuclear reactors following the Fukishima accident. Nuclear, which had supplied 30 percent of Japanese electricity from 1987 to 2011, supplied only 2 percent in 2012 (hydropower supplied 8 percent). Nuclear electricity was replaced with electricity from petroleum, coal, and liquified natural gas. As a result, electricity generation from fossil fuels rose to 90 percent in 2012. \\"Japan‚Äôs fossil-fueled generation remains high because of continuing nuclear plant outages\\", US Energy Information Administration, 15 March 2013. In January 2017, the Japanese government announced plans to build 45 new coal-fired power plants in the next ten years, largely to replace expensive electricity from petroleum power plants.Babs McHugh, \\"Japan plans to build 45 coal power plants in next decade,\\" Platts, 3 February 2017.  Europe  In July 2014, CAN Europe, WWF European Policy Office, HEAL, EEB and Climate-Alliance Germany published a report calling for the decommissioning of the thirty most polluting coal-fired power plants in Europe. = Austria = Austria closed its last coal power plant in 2020. = Belgium = After the government denied a 2009 application to build a new power plant in Antwerp, the Langerlo power station burned its last ton of coal in March 2016, ending the use of coal fired power plants in Belgium. = Denmark = As part of their Climate Policy Plan, Denmark stated that it will phase out oil for heating purposes and coal by 2030. Additionally, their goal is to supply a 100% of their electricity and heating needs with renewable energy five years later (i.e. 2035). = Finland = In 2020 Finland may be the only European country that invested in new coal power in Europe.The end of coal: EU energy companies pledge no new plants from 2020 The guardian 5 April 2017 Uniper Dattel4 Germany is major owned by Finnish major state owned company Fortum.Fortum vastaa vihdoin Saksan hiilivoimalakohuun ‚Äì Energiaprofessori: Saksan hallituksen p√§√§t√∂s sallia uusi hiilivoimala on skandaali, Uniperin uuden hiilivoimalan k√§ynnistyminen on kolhu my√∂s Fortumin maineelle, my√∂nt√§√§ suomalaisyritys.

In December 2017, to fight against global warming, France adopted a law banning new fossil fuel exploitation projects and closing current ones by 2040 in all of its territories. France thus became the first country to programme the end of fossil fuel exploitation.Agence France-Presse, \\"France bans fracking and oil extraction in all of its territories \\", The Guardian, 20 December 2017 (page visited on 30 December 2017). \\"La France devient le premier pays √† programmer la fin des hydrocarbures\\", Radio t√©l√©vision suisse, 30 December 2017 (page visited on 30 December 2017). = Germany = 3,500-4,000 environmental activists blocking a coal mine to limit climate change (Ende Gel√§nde 2016). German electricity generation by source, 2000‚Äì2017 Hard coal mining has long been subsidized in Germany, reaching a peak of ‚Ç¨6.7billion in 1996 and dropping to ‚Ç¨2.7billion in 2005 due to falling output. These subsidies represent a burden on public finances and imply a substantial opportunity cost, diverting funds away from other, more beneficial public investments. In 2007, Germany announced plans to phase out hard coal-industry subsidies by 2018, a move which is expected to end hard coal mining in Germany. This exit is later than the EU-mandated end by 2014. Solar and wind are major sources of energy and renewable energy generation, around 15% as of December 2013, and growing. Coal is still the largest source of power in Germany. In 2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her party agreed to legislation to phase out Germany's hard coal mining sector. That does not mean that they support phasing out coal in general. There were plans to build about 25 new plants in the coming years. Most German coal power plants were built in the 1960s, and have a low energy efficiency. Public sentiment against coal power plants is growing and the construction or planning of some plants has been stopped. A number are under construction and still being built. No concrete plan is in place to reduce coal-fired electricity generation. As of October 2015, the remaining coal plants still under planning include: Niederaussem, Profen, and Stade. The coal plants currently under construction include: Mannheim, Hamm D, Datteln, and Willhelmshaven. Between 2012 and 2015, six new plants went online. All of these plants are 600‚Äì1800 MWe. In 2014, Germany's coal consumption dropped for the first time, having risen each year since the low during the 2009 recession. A 2014 study, found that coal is not making a comeback in Germany, as is sometimes claimed. Rather renewables have more than offset the nuclear facilities that have been shut down as a result of Germany's nuclear phase-out (Atomausstieg). Hard coal plants now face financial stringency as their operating hours are cut back by the market. But in contrast, lignite-fired generation is in a safe position until the unless government policies change. To phase-out coal, Germany should seek to strength the emissions trading system (EU-ETS), consider a carbon tax, promote energy efficiency, and strengthen the use of natural gas as a bridge fuel. In 2016, the German government and affected lignite power plant operators Mibrag, RWE, and Vattenfall reached an understanding (Verst√§ndigung) on the transfer of lignite power plant units into security standby (√úberf√ºhrung von Braunkohlekraftwerksbl√∂cken in die Sicherheitsbereitschaft). As a result, eight lignite-fired power plants are to be mothballed and later closed, with the first plant scheduled to cease operation in October 2016 and the last in October 2019. The affected operators will receive state compensation for foregone profits. The European Commission has declared government plans to use ‚Ç¨1.6billion of public financing for this purpose to be in line with EU state aid rules. A 2016 study, found that the phase-out of lignite in Lusatia (Lausitz) by 2030 can be financed by future owner EPH in a manner that avoids taxpayer involvement. Instead, liabilities covering decommissioning and land rehabilitation could be paid by EPH directly into a foundation, perhaps run by the public company LMBV. The study calculates the necessary provisions at ‚Ç¨2.6billion. In November 2016, the German utility STEAG announced it will be decommissioning five coal-fired generating units in North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland due to low wholesale electricity prices. A coal phase-out for Germany is implied in Germany's Climate Action Plan 2050, environment minister Barbara Hendricks said in an interview on 21November 2016. \\"If you read the Climate Action Plan carefully, you will find that the exit from coal-fired power generation is the immanent consequence of the energy sector target.... By 2030... half of the coal-fired power production must have ended, compared to 2014\\", she said. Plans to cut down the ancient Hambach Forest to extend the Hambach open pit mine in 2018 have resulted in massive protests. On 5 Oct 2018 a German court ruled against the further destruction of the forest for mining purposes. The ruling states, the court needs more time to reconsider the complaint. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, welcomed the court's ruling. The forest is located approximately 29 km west of the city center of Cologne (specifically Cologne Cathedral). In January 2019 the German Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment initiates Germany's plans to entirely phase out and shut down the 84 remaining coal-fired plants on its territory by 2038. = Netherlands = On 22 September 2016, the Dutch parliament voted for a 55% cut in emissions by 2030, a move which would require the closure of the country's five coal-fired power plants. The vote is not binding on the government however. = Spain = In October 2018, the S√°nchez government and Spanish Labour unions settled an agreement to close ten Spanish coal mines at the end of 2018. The government pre-engaged to spend 250 million Euro to pay for early retirements, occupational retraining and structural change. In 2018, about 2.3 per cent of the electric energy produced in Spain was produced in coal-burning power plants.theguardian.com 26. October 2018: Spain to close most coal mines after striking ‚Ç¨250m deal = Sweden = As of 2019 coal is used to a limited extent to fuel three co-generation plants in Sweden that produces electricity and district heating. The operators of these plants plan to phase out coal by 2020, 2022 and 2025 respectively. In August 2019 one of the three remaining coal burning power producers announced that they had phased out coal prematurely in 2019 instead of 2020. V√§rtaverket was scheduled to close in 2022, but closed in 2020. In addition to heat and power coal is also used for steel production, there are long-term plans to phase out coal from steel production: Sweden is constructing hydrogen-based pilot steel plant to replace coke and coal usage in steel production. Once this technology is commercialized with the hydrogen generated from renewable energy sources (biogas or electricity), the carbon foot print of steel production would reduce drastically. = United Kingdom = The remaining 4 coal-fired power stations will be closed by 2024 or earlier. This will not be a complete phase-out of fossil fuels because gas-fired power stations will continue to provide some firm power. Scotland's last coal power station closed in 2016 and Wales' last coal power station closed in December 2019. Coal power in England has also reduced substantially. In generating capability there has been the closure of the Hinton Heavies, and closure or conversion to biomass of the remaining coal plants will be completed by 2024. In terms of actual production, in 2018 it was less than at any time since the industrial revolution. The first \\"coal free day\\" took place in 2017. Coal supplied 5.4% of UK electricity in 2018, down from 30% in 2014, and 70% in 1990. Gas heating will be banned for new homes by 2025. Petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2035.  Oceania  Australia = Electricity generation from renewable sources in Australia in 2010 The Australian Greens party have proposed to phase out coal power stations. The NSW Greens proposed an immediate moratorium on coal-fired power stations and want to end all coal mining and coal industry subsidies. The Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party also oppose nuclear power. The Federal Government and Victorian State Government want to modify existing coal-fired power stations into clean coal power stations. The Federal Labor government extended the mandatory renewable energy targets, an initiative to ensure that new sources of electricity are more likely to be from wind power, solar power and other sources of renewable energy in Australia. Australia is one of the largest consumers of coal per capita, and also the largest exporter. The proposals are strongly opposed by industry, unionsAustralian Options Magazine, CFMEU on coal phase out and the main Opposition Party in Parliament (now forming the party in government after the September 2013 election). = New Zealand = In October 2007, the Clark Labour government introduced a 10year moratorium on new fossil fuel thermal power generation. The ban was limited to state-owned utilities, although an extension to the private sector was considered. The new government under MP John Key (NZNP) elected in November 2008 repealed this legislation. In 2014, almost 80 per cent of the electricity produced in New Zealand was from sustainable energy. On 6 August 2015, Genesis Energy Limited announced that it would close its two last coal-fired power stations.  Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles  Many countries and cities have introduced bans on the sales of new internal combustion engine vehicles, requiring all new cars to be electric vehicles or otherwise powered by clean, non-emitting sources. Such bans include the United Kingdom by 2035 and Norway by 2025. Many transit authorities are working to purchase only electric buses while also restricting use of ICE vehicles in the city center to limit air pollution. Many US states have a zero-emissions vehicle mandate, incrementally requiring a certain percent of cars sold to be electric.  Public opinion = Opinion polls  Opinion research = In October 2007, Civil Society Institute released the results of a poll of 1,003 US citizens conducted by Opinion Research Corporation.

Renewable energy, or energy that is harnessed from renewable sources, is an alternative energy. However, alternative energy can refer to non renewable sources as well, like nuclear energy. Between the alternative sources of energy are: solar energy, hydroelectricity, marine energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, biofuels, ethanol and Hydrogen. Energy efficiency is complementary to the use of alternative energy sources, when phasing-out fossil fuels.  Renewable energy  The worldwide growth of renewable energy is shown by the green line Renewable energy is energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. , 19% of global final energy consumption comes from renewable resources, with 9% of all energy from traditional biomass, mainly used for heating, 1% from biofuels, 4% from hydroelectricity and 4% from biomass, geothermal or solar heat. Popular renewables (wind, solar, geothermal and biomass for power) accounted for another 1.4% and are growing rapidly. While renewable energy supplies are growing and have displaced coal in some regions, the amount of coal burned in 2021, is expected to be the same as it was in 2014.  Hydroelectricity  Chief Joseph Dam near Bridgeport, Washington, US, is a major run-of-the-river station without a sizeable reservoir. In 2015, hydroelectric energy generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity. In Europe and North America environmental concerns around land flooded by large reservoirs ended 30 years of dam construction in the 1990s. Since then large dams and reservoirs continue to be built in countries like China, Brazil and India. Run-of-the- river hydroelectricity and small hydro have become popular alternatives to conventional dams that may create reservoirs in environmentally sensitive areas.  Wind power  Lillgrund Wind Farm in Sweden First wind farm consisting of 7,5 MW Enercon E-126 turbines, Estinnes, Belgium, 20 July 2010, two months before completion; note the 2-part blades. A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore. Wind power has grown dramatically since 2005 and by 2015 supplied almost 1% of global energy consumption. Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the United States and China. The Gansu Wind Farm in China has over 5,000 MW installed with a goal of 20,000 MW by 2020. China has several other \\"wind power bases\\" of similar size. The Alta Wind Energy Center in California, United States is the largest onshore wind farm outside of China, with a capacity of 1020 MW of power.Terra-Gen Press Release , 17 April 2012 As of February 2012, the Walney Wind Farm in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 MW, followed by Thanet Offshore Wind Project (300 MW), also in the United Kingdom. As of February 2012, the F√¢nt√¢nele-Cogealac Wind Farm in Romania is the largest onshore wind farm in Europe at 600 MW. There are many large wind farms under construction and these include Sinus Holding Wind Farm (700 MW), Anholt Offshore Wind Farm (400 MW), BARD Offshore 1 (400 MW), Clyde Wind Farm (350 MW), Greater Gabbard wind farm (500 MW), Lincs Wind Farm (270 MW), London Array (1000 MW), Lower Snake River Wind Project (343 MW), Macarthur Wind Farm (420 MW), Shepherds Flat Wind Farm (845 MW), and Sheringham Shoal (317 MW). Wind power in Denmark produced the equivalent of 42.1% of total electricity consumption in 2015, however, use of wind for heating is minor.Wittrup, Sanne. \\"Dong: Vores kraftv√¶rker bruger allerede billig vindm√∏llestr√∏m i elpatroner\\" Ingeni√∏ren, 15 January 2015.

Solar  In 2017, solar power provided 1.7% of total worldwide electricity production, growing at 35% per annum. By 2020 the solar contribution to global final energy consumption is expected to exceed 1%. = Solar photovoltaics = The 71.8 MW Lieberose Photovoltaic Park in Germany Solar photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity and many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built. The size of these stations has increased progressively over the last decade with frequent new capacity records. Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. Solar power plants have no fuel costs or emissions during operation. = Concentrated solar power = The 150 MW Andasol solar power station is a commercial parabolic trough solar thermal power plant, located in Spain. The Andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity even when the sun isn't shining. Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45  Biofuels  Biofuels, in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are entering the market. However, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment, food security, and land use.The Royal Society (January 2008). Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges, , p. 61.Gordon Quaiattini. Biofuels are part of the solution Canada.com, 25 April 2008. Retrieved 23 December 2009.  Biomass  Biomass is biological material from living, or recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials.Biomass Energy Center . Biomassenergycentre.org.uk. Retrieved on 28 February 2012. As a renewable energy source, biomass can either be used directly, or indirectly once or converted into another type of energy product such as biofuel. Biomass can be converted to energy in three ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. Using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, NOx (nitrogen oxides), VOCs (volatile organic compounds), particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas in some cases (such as with indoor heating and cooking). Utilization of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications. Black carbon a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming. In 2009 a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning, and to a lesser extent by fossil fuel burning. Denmark has increased the use of biomass and garbage,Klimar√•d: Affaldsimport vil belaste dansk CO2-regnskab 27 November 2015. and decreased the use of coal.Danish energy statistics, 2014 page 5 and 12  Nuclear energy  The 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report identifies nuclear energy as one of the technologies that can provide electricity with less than 5% of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power. There are more than 60 nuclear reactors shown as under construction in the list of Nuclear power by country with China leading at 23. Globally, more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years but overall capacity has increased. China has stated its plans to double nuclear generation by 2030. India also plans to greatly increase its nuclear power. Several countries have enacted laws to cease construction on new nuclear power stations. Several European countries have debated nuclear phase- outs and others have completely shut down some reactors. Three nuclear accidents have influenced the slowdown of nuclear power: the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the USSR, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors and pledged to close the rest by the end of 2022. Italy voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear. Switzerland and Spain have banned the construction of new reactors. Japan's prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in Japan's reliance on nuclear power. Taiwan's president did the same. Shinz≈ç Abe, prime minister of Japan since December 2012, announced a plan to restart some of the 54 Japanese nuclear power plants and to continue some nuclear reactors under construction. As of 2016, countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Norway have no nuclear power stations and remain opposed to nuclear power. Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland are phasing-out their nuclear power.Erika Simpson and Ian Fairlie, Dealing with nuclear waste is so difficult that phasing out nuclear power would be the best option, Lfpress, 26 February 2016.  Energy efficiency  Moving away from fossil fuels will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.InterAcademy Council (2007). Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are said to be the \\"twin pillars\\" of sustainable energy policy. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007). The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy Report E074. > Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising > clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use > grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. > Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand > growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon > content of energy sources is also needed. The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation.International Energy Agency (2007).

It is played on 6x6 board and uses 4 sets of standard chess pieces. Instead of traditional chess pieces, the \\"kingdoms\\" are represented by pictures of the pieces on large colored tokens, (each player has his own color: red, yellow, green, or blue), accompanied by a humorous picture of a Dork Tower character.  Rules  The game can be played by two to four players, pieces act like their normal chess counterparts (i.e. rooks move vertically and horizontally), with minor exceptions. Due to the multi-player nature of the game, there is no checkmate and kings can be captured. The goal of the game is to be the last player who still has a king. Bosworth has certain rules for game set-up and placing new pieces on the board. The game board has 36 squares, in a 6x6 pattern, but the four corner squares are marked by trees, which designate the squares as impassable, and the remaining four squares between the trees on each side are marked by tents and are the \\"camps\\" of the pieces. At the start of the game each player takes his tokens, puts four pawns in his spawn camp, and shuffles the remaining tokens face down into a deck. From there the player draws four tokens from the top of the deck, and chooses from these tokens to replace empty spots in his/her spawn camp. The player must then draw enough pieces from the deck to get four in his/her hand.

It was originally released in 1991 for the NEC PC-9801, ported 1992 to the Super Famicom and 1994 to the Sega Mega Drive. During 1997, Lord Monarch was remade for Windows as Lord Monarch Online and released for free in both Japanese, and for the first time, English. Lord Monarch is one of the 42 titles included in the Japanese version of the Mega Drive Mini. Gameplay=Super Famicom version The Super Famicom version is similar to the Sega Mega Drive version, except there are more themes in addition to the medieval Europe theme. There is a futuristic theme with robots, a fast food theme with French fries and soft drinks attacking health food, a Three Kingdoms era theme, and a fairy-tale theme. The game is automatically paused until someone presses the Start button, so there is unlimited time for making alliances in the Super Famicom version‚Äîuntil the start button is pressed. This mode gives the player the advantage unlike the Sega Mega Drive version because he can take his time and find an ally that is strategically proper for him. The Super Famicom version of Lord Monarch was one of the few games to support the Super Famicom mouse. A later version of the game was broadcast exclusively for Japanese markets via the Super Famicom's Satellaview subunit under the name BS Lord Monarch. Sega Mega Drive version The object is to destroy all the camps and peasants of all the player's rival kingdoms under a strict time limit. Alliances can be formed near the beginning of the game to help the player. However, the alliance is only effective until the enemy alliance is defeated. Then the former allies declare war on each other. Victory through a cunning alliance is impossible because game rules dictate that there can only be one winner at the end of the game; that is why the two former allies need to go to war in order to claim the victory. Peasants have to do engineering tasks as well as military tasks. For example, bridges, monster-filled caves, and fences can be created or destroyed for the purposes of strategy. Peasants may also merge their units to become soldiers and eventually knights when there's enough units in that army. Players can play in either campaign (which consists of helping a king eradicate a rebel force) or battle mode (where the player has to take on three rival kingdoms simultaneously while expanding his nation). In battle mode the player can choose from a large array of different art styles, such as playing as a foreign Japanese army, animals trying to take over a forest, monsters in hell or even as a fast food business. These modes do not effect the gameplay in any way however each mode has its own unique levels. The simplistic diplomacy system can never be used in a match after five minutes in the game, making it useful only for delaying war with a neighboring kingdom. Human units as well as orcs and demons are used for peasants, soldiers, and knights. Also, a leader can be either a warrior, a magician, or a shaman. The player even has a leader avatar that must liberate hanged men from the gallows to be his assistant, collect treasure chests from the countryside in order to gain a mass influx of gold, and to force nearby cities to pay taxes. This turns the city's banners into the player's colors and at a random time, a taxman appears and goes to the player's castle to give him gold pieces to help with the war effort. Taxes must be controlled or else the coffers will go bankrupt and the player loses the game. Even the three computer controlled opponents must control their tax rate. There is a medieval environment to the game in all levels of the game.

The motivation at the time was a sense that introducing these species of plants and animals would enrich the flora and fauna of a region. These societies were born during a period of colonialism when Europeans began to settle in unfamiliar environments, and the movement sought to establish familiar plants and animals (mainly from Europe) in new areas while also bringing exotic and useful foreign plants and animals into the European centres. Today it is widely understood that introducing species can be harmful to native species and their ecosystems; for example, in Australia plants were harmed by rabbits' overgrazing; in North America house sparrows displace and kill native birds; and around the world, salamander populations are today threatened by introduced fungal infections. At the time of acclimatisation societies, however, this was insufficiently understood. A definition of acclimatisation was attempted by Alfred Russel Wallace in his entry in the 11th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1911). Here Wallace tried to differentiate the idea from other terms like domestication and naturalization. He noted that a domesticated animal could live in environments controlled by humans. Naturalization, he suggested included the process of acclimatization which involved \\"gradual adjustment\\". The idea, at least in France, was associated with Lamarckism and Wallace noted that there were some like Charles Darwin who denied the possibility of forcing individual animals to adjust. Wallace however pointed out that there was the possibility that there were variations among individuals and that some could have the ability to adapt to new environments.  In France  Jardin d'Acclimatation in 1861 The first Acclimatisation society was La Societ√© Zoologique d'Acclimatation founded in Paris on 10 May 1854 by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. It was essentially an offshoot of the Paris museum of natural history and the other staff included de Br√©au, Antoine C√©sar Becquerel and his son Alexandre. Saint-Hilaire believed in the Lamarckian idea that humans and animals could be forced to adapt to new environments. The Paris society established a branch in Algeria as well as the Jardin d' Acclimatation in Paris in 1861 to showcase not just new animals and plants but also people from other lands. Rewards in the form of medals were offered for anyone in the colonies to establish breeding animals. The rules were that at least six specimens had to be maintained with at least two instances of breeding in captivity. After Saint-Hilaire's death in 1861 the Society was headed by √âdouard Drouyn de Lhuys, foreign minister to Napoleon III and many of the functionaries were diplomats who established ties with officers in the colonies both French and foreign. Franco-British as well as Franco-Australian ties were involved in the movements of plants and animals. Australian acacias for instance were introduced in Algeria by the French and by the British in South Africa. Fran√ßois Laporte, naturalist and consul in Melbourne and Ferdinand von Mueller of the Acclimatisation Society of Victoria were involved in the transfer of many plant species out of Australia. In some cases these movements were not direct but via Paris and Kew.  In Britain  Members of the British Society in 1861 The British acclimatisation society originated from an idea proposed by the management of The Field journal. A meeting was held on January 21, 1859, at the London Tavern on Bishopsgate Street. The attendees included Professor Richard Owen at the head of the table and the servings included a large pike, American partridges, a young bean goose and an African eland. At the meeting Mitchell and others suggested that many of these exotic animals could live in the British wilderness. Professor Owen wrote in the newspapers later on the taste of the eland and the need for animal introductions. On June 26, 1860, another meeting was held and the Acclimatisation Society was formally founded in London and a year later the Secretary to the Society, Frank Buckland, a popular naturalist known for his taste in exotic meats, noted the \\"success\\" of the Society in introducing peafowl, common pheasant, swan, starling and linnet into Australia through the efforts of Edward Wilson. One of the supporters of the Society was Miss Burdett Coutts. Other such societies spread quickly around the world, particularly to European colonies in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand. In many instances they existed both as societies for the study of natural history as well as to improve the success rate of introduced species. In 1850, English sparrows were introduced into America and Eugene Schieffelin introduced starlings in 1890 as part of a plan to introduce all the birds mentioned in Shakespeare.  Australia and New Zealand  The appeal of acclimatisation societies in colonies, particularly Australia and New Zealand, was the belief that the local fauna was in some way deficient or impoverished; there was also an element of nostalgia in colonists who desired to see familiar species. An Australian settler, J. Martin, complained in 1830 that the \\"trees retained their leaves and shed their bark instead, the swans were black, the eagles white, the bees were stingless, some mammals had pockets, others laid eggs, it was warmest on the hills...\\" It was here that the desire to make the land feel more like England was strongest. The Acclimatisation Society of Victoria was established in 1861. Speaking at the Society, George Bennett pointed out how it was important to have such an organisation, citing the example of the Earl of Knowsley who had been conducting successful experiments in private whose results had been lost with his death. A major proponent of importing and exporting trees and plants was Ferdinand von Mueller. Introductions of commercially valuable species or game species were also made. In some instances the results were disastrous, such as the economic and ecological effects of introducing rabbits to Australia or possums to New Zealand. The disastrous effects were rapidly felt and a Rabbit Nuisance Act was passed in 1876 in New Zealand. To make matters worse, the suggestion was made that weasels and stoats could control the rabbits. Despite warnings from Alfred Newton and others, these predators were introduced and Herbert Guthrie-Smith declared it as an \\"attempt to correct a blunder by a crime.\\" In 1893, T.S. Palmer of California wrote on the dangers of animal introduction. In 1906, the editors of the Avicultural Magazine were decidedly against the idea of bird introductions.

It is performed by treating the area with an antiseptic, such as iodine-based solution, and then making a small incision to puncture the skin using a sterile instrument such as a sharp needle, a pointed scalpel or a lancet. This allows the pus fluid to escape by draining out through the incision. Good medical practice for large abdominal abscesses requires insertion of a drainage tube, preceded by insertion of a PICC line to enable readiness of treatment for possible septic shock. Incision and drainage is often abbreviated as \\"I&D;\\" or \\"IND\\" by medical professionals. Adjunct antibiotics Uncomplicated cutaneous abscesses do not need antibiotics after successful drainage. In incisional abscesses For incisional abscesses, it is recommended that incision and drainage is followed by covering the area with a thin layer of gauze followed by sterile dressing. The dressing should be changed and the wound irrigated with normal saline at least twice each day. In addition, it is recommended to administer an antibiotic active against staphylococci and streptococci, preferably vancomycin when there is a risk of MRSA. The wound can be allowed to close by secondary intention. Alternatively, if the infection is cleared and healthy granulation tissue is evident at the base of the wound, the edges of the incision may be reapproximated, such as by using butterfly stitches, staples or sutures.

Tropical Smoothie Franchise Development Corporation was founded in 1997 in Destin, Florida, and the first franchised store opened in 1998 in Tallahassee, Florida. Tropical Smoothie Cafe is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1999, they created a niche in the smoothie category by introducing a line of food items including sandwiches and wraps. As more locations opened, the individual Cafes redesigned their store decor to offer a beach house theme with bright white walls, an open kitchen concept, vibrant colors, and tropical artwork. In 2006, Tropical Smoothie Cafe opened their 200th store in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and in 2011 they opened their 300th store in Fort Myers, Florida..

Using her mobile phone, Arap called her husband, Dmitri Tereshin, who came from Murmansk to Severomorsk to help her, but she had already been moved to Murmansk. The personnel of the facility refused to give her husband information regarding the reason for the hospitalization. That same evening, their daughter Taisiya came to the facility with her husband. The duty medic, Yulya Kopyia, told them that publication of the article \\"Madhouse\\" proved Arap's insanity. Kopyia also said that Taisiya would be put into the psychiatric hospital, too, if she insisted on obtaining documents relating to Arap's hospitalization. Taisiya was later fired from her job in a local bank for \\"giving too many interviews about her mother.\\" Two days later, on July 7, 2007, Arap‚Äôs husband and daughter were allowed to visit her at the hospital. Arap claimed that she was severely beaten by the medical personnel and had bruises all over her body. She was tied to her bed and treated with unidentified 'sedatives'. To protest, Arap went on a five-day hunger strike, and was eventually fed by force. Court decision On July 18, 2007, a court in Murmansk sanctioned hospitalization of Arap. The court ignored requests from Arap's husband and daughter to release her. Relatives insisted that she was not a danger to herself or society. Svetlana Lukicheva, Arap's advocate, submitted the complaint to the Regional Court. Arap's husband forwarded the complaint to the regional court and regional health care institutions. Commission On July 30, 2007, Vladimir Lukin chose an \\"expert commission\\" headed by Yuri Savenko, president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to investigate Arap's hospitalization. According to Yuri Savenko, the forceful hospitalization of Arap was completely unwarranted. At the same time he said that Arap \\"showed signs of mental instability\\" and that Arap admitted to being briefly hospitalized for stress and insomnia in 2004. Savenko explained his assessment of the situation as follows: \\"We studied medical documents and materials related to the case, and spent an hour and a half with her. The result was that we came to the conclusion that we're dealing with a person who is in fact ill. There are no 'politics' behind this.

MACs are designed to replace a conventional Weapons company, being more mobile and thus more usable in Mid- and High-Intensity Conflict (MIC-HIC). History The units were introduced in the mid-1990s, based on the Marine Corps' Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT), and its critical use in Operation Desert Storm. The MAC furthered the CAAT structure to encompass a whole infantry company. The first MAC was with 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines. Structure Mobile Assault Platoons are part of Mobile Assault Companies, which is designed to replace the current Weapons company structure of a Marine infantry battalion. In this scheme, the Weapons company becomes a fourth infantry maneuver element, in conjunction with the battalion's three rifle companies. The Weapons company's Combined Anti-Armor Team or Combined Arms Assault Team (CAAT), mortar platoon, and heavy machine gun platoon are reorganized to provide the manpower of a MAC. Of the Weapons company's weapon systems, the BGM-71 TOW, M2 Machine Gun, and the Mk 19 grenade launcher can be mounted on vehicle turrets. However, mortars cannot be fired from the Humvee or MRAP. MAPs are mounted units, using wheeled vehicles such as the Humvee and MRAP for movement rather than conducting foot patrols.

After having sex, the two spontaneously decide that they will travel to Algeria, where Naima's parents come from, and where Zano's (Romain Duris) pied-noir parents were once exiled. Their adventurous journey to Algiers is full of character exploration, relationship hiccups and imagery. The film was also a homecoming for Gatlif himself, seeing him return to Algeria 43 years after he left. Plot The viewer is not intended to like nor dislike either character. Zano is meant to be brooding and profound to the point of being sulky, and world-hating and Naima wildly passionate to the point of appearing wanton and unstable; and both far too self-absorbed to care about either one or the other.

In World War I, he fought briefly on the Polish front during 1914-15. From 1921 to 1931, he made a career in the Prussian police. On 1 October 1931, he joined the Nazi Party (member no. 665,697) and the SS (member no. 14,220). On 20 April 1942, he was promoted to SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer. On 1 July 1939, he was appointed the first director of the newly formed SS Court Main Office in Munich, the legal department of the SS in Nazi Germany. It was responsible for formulating the laws and codes for the SS and various other groups of the police, conducting its own investigations and trials, as well as administering the SS and Police Courts and penal systems. This legal status meant all SS personnel were only accountable to the SS court. This effectively placed the SS above German law. Paul Scharfe died of natural causes in July 1942.

It lives in packs of about five to twenty. There are estimated to be less than 180 wolves on Vancouver Island.Vancouver Island Wolf Taxonomy This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). Studies using mitochondrial DNA have indicated that the wolves of coastal south-east Alaska are genetically distinct from inland gray wolves, reflecting a pattern also observed in other taxa. They show a phylogenetic relationship with extirpated wolves from the south (Oklahoma), indicating that these wolves are the last remains of a once widespread group that has been largely extirpated during the last century, and that the wolves of northern North America had originally expanded from southern refuges below the Wisconsin glaciation after the ice had melted at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. These findings call into question the taxonomic classification of C.l. nulibus proposed by Nowak. Another study found that the wolves of coastal British Columbia were genetically and ecologically distinct from the inland wolves, including other wolves from inland British Columbia. A study of the three coastal wolves indicated a close phylogenetic relationship across regions that are geographically and ecologically contiguous, and the study proposed that Canis lupus ligoni (Alexander Archipelago wolf), Canis lupus columbianus (British Columbia wolf), and Canis lupus crassodon (Vancouver Island wolf) should be recognized as a single subspecies of Canis lupus. In 2016, two studies compared the DNA sequences of 42,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in North American gray wolves and found the coastal wolves to be genetically and phenotypically distinct from other wolves. They share the same habitat and prey species, and form one of the study's 6 identified ecotypes - a genetically and ecologically distinct population separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects the wolf's preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into. Wolves that prey on fish and small deer in wet, coastal environments tend to be smaller than other wolves. In 2016, a study of mitochondrial DNA sequences of both modern and ancient wolves generated a phylogenetic tree which indicated that the two most basal North American haplotypes included the Mexican wolf and the Vancouver Island wolf. Appearance The Vancouver Island wolf is of medium size, measuring roughly 26 to 32 inches high, 4 to 5 feet from nose to end of tail, and weighing roughly 60 lbs. It is usually a mix of grey, brown, and black. Occasionally, they are seen pure white. Diet The wolf's main food source is seafood, making up 90% of its diet. Salmon accounts for nearly a quarter of their diet. They also forage on barnacles, clams, herring eggs, seals, river otters, and whale carcasses.

World War II  After conversion and fitting out, Joseph Hewes sortied from Hampton Roads on October 24, 1942 as part of the Center Attack Group of Admiral Hewitt's Western Naval Task Force en route to French Morocco as part of Operation Torch. She was carrying 80 officers and 1,074 men of the reinforced 3rd Infantry Division, U.S. Army, plus ammunition and supplies. The transport arrived off Fedhala on November 8, by 0705 hours, landed all troops, and then commenced unloading ammunition and supplies. By November 11, Joseph Hewes had completed cargo unloading and had received 30 casualties from the beach fire.  Sinking  At 1950 hours she took a torpedo hit in No. 2 hold from U-173. The transport settled by the bow and began filling rapidly with water. Captain Smith endeavored to pick up anchor or slip chain but, as the entire forecastle was under water, this was not possible. He then attempted to beach the ship by backing engines but her propeller was out of the water, so the order was given to abandon ship.Joseph Hewes (APA22), Edward Rutledge (APA24), Hugh L.

By his coolness, calmness, and his devotion to duty in placing the safety of the crew and ship before his own, he instilled confidence in every officer and member of the crew. The U-173 paid heavily for her victory, for she was sunk 5 days later off Casablanca by American destroyers.

Governments try to combat drug addiction or dependence with policies that address both the demand and supply of drugs, as well as policies that mitigate the harms of drug use, and for medical treatment. Demand reduction measures include voluntary treatment, rehabilitation, substitution therapy, overdose management, alternatives to incarceration for drug related minor offenses, medical prescription of drugs, awareness campaigns, community social services, and support for families. Supply side reduction involves measures such as enacting foreign policy aimed at eradicating the international cultivation of plants used to make drugs and interception of drug trafficking, fines for drug offenses, incarceration for persons convicted for drug offenses. Policies that help mitigate drug use include needle syringe programs and drug substitution programs, and free facilities for testing a drug's purity. Drugs subject to control vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, heroin is regulated almost everywhere; substances such as qat, codeine are regulated in some places, but not others. Most jurisdictions also regulate prescription drugs, medicinal drugs not considered dangerous but that can only be supplied to holders of a medical prescription, and sometimes drugs available without prescription but only from an approved supplier such as a pharmacy, but this is not usually described as a \\"drug policy\\". International treaties The International Opium Convention, signed in 1912 during the First International Opium Conference, was the first international drug control treaty. It went into force globally in 1919 when it was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. A revised Convention was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series in 1928. It also imposed some restrictions‚Äînot total prohibition‚Äîon the export of Indian hemp (cannabis sativa forma indica). In 1961 it was superseded by the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to control global drug trading and use. The Convention banned countries from treating addicts by prescribing illegal substances, allowing only scientific and medical uses of drugs. It did not detail precise drug laws and was not itself binding on countries, which had to pass their own legislation in conformance with the principles of the Convention.BBC: The UK's Misuse of Drugs Act (1971), 19 February 2009 Drug policy by country= Australia  Australian drug laws are criminal laws and mostly exist at the state and territory level, not the federal, and are therefore different, which means an analysis of trends and laws for Australia is complicated. The federal jurisdiction has enforcement powers over national borders. In October 2016, Australia legislated for some medicinal use cannabis.  Bolivia  Like Colombia, the Bolivian government signed onto the ATPA in 1991 and called for the forced eradication of the coca plant in the 1990s and early 2000s. Until 2004, the government allowed each residential family to grow 1600m2 of coca crop, enough to provide the family with a monthly minimum wage. In 2005, Bolivia saw another reformist movement. The leader of a coca grower group, Evo Morales, was elected President in 2005. Morales ended any U.S. backed War on Drugs. President Morales opposed the decriminalization of drugs but saw the coca crop as an important piece of indigenous history and a pillar of the community because of the traditional use of chewing coca leaves. In 2009, the Bolivian Constitution backed the legalization and industrialization of coca products. Canada Colombia  coca plant Under President Ronald Reagan, the United States declared War on Drugs in the late 1980s; the Colombian drug lords were widely viewed as the root of the cocaine issue in America. In the 1990s, Colombia was home to the world's two largest drug cartels: the Cali cartel and the Medell√≠n cartel. It became Colombia's priority, as well as the priority of the other countries in the Andean Region, to extinguish the cartels and drug trafficking from the region. In 1999, under President Andr√©s Pastrana, Colombia passed Plan Colombia. Plan Colombia funded the Andean Region's fight against the drug cartels and drug trafficking. With the implementation of Plan Colombia, the Colombian government aimed to destroy the coca crop. This prohibitionist regime has had controversial results, especially on human rights. Colombia has seen a significant decrease in coca cultivation. In 2001, there were 362,000 acres of coca crop in Colombia; by 2011, fewer than 130,000 acres remained. However, farmers who cultivated the coca crop for uses other than for the creation of cocaine, such as the traditional use of chewing coca leaves, became impoverished. Since 1994, consumption of drugs has been decriminalized. However, possession and trafficking of drugs are still illegal. In 2014, Colombia further eased its prohibitionist stance on the coca crop by ceasing aerial fumigation of the coca crop and creating programs for addicts. President Juan Manuel Santos (2010‚Äìpresent), has called for the revision of Latin American drug policy, and is open to talks about legalization.  Ecuador  Narco submarine seized in Ecuador In the mid-1980s, under President Le√≥n Febres-Cordero, Ecuador adopted the prohibitionist drug policy recommended by the United States. By cooperating with the United States, Ecuador received tariff exemptions from the United States. In February 1990, the United States held the Cartagena Drug Summit, in the hopes of continuing progress on the War on Drugs. Three of the four countries in the Andean Region were invited to the Summit: Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, with the notable absence of Ecuador. Two of those three countries‚ÄîColombia and Bolivia‚Äîjoined the Andean Trade Preference Act, later called the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, in 1992. Ecuador, along with Peru, would eventually join the ATPA in 1993. The Act united the region in the War on Drugs as well as stimulated their economies with tariff exemptions. In 1991, President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos passed Law 108, a law that decriminalized drug use, while continuing to prosecute drug possession. In reality, Law 108 set a trap that snared many citizens. Citizens confused the legality of use with the illegality of carrying drugs on their person. This led to a large increase in prison populations, as 100% of drug crimes were processed. In 2007, 18,000 prisoners were kept in a prison built to hold up to 7,000. In urban regions of Ecuador as many as 45% of male inmates were serving time for drug charges; this prison demographic rises to 80% of female inmates. In 2008, under Ecuador's new Constitution, current prisoners serving time were allowed the \\"smuggler pardon\\" if they were prosecuted for purchasing or carrying up to 2 kg of any drug, and they already served 10% of their sentence. Later, in 2009, Law 108 was replaced by the Organic Penal Code (COIP). The COIP contains many of the same rules and regulations as Law 108, but it established clear distinctions among large, medium and small drug traffickers, as well as between the mafia and rural growers, and prosecutes accordingly. In 2013, the Ecuadorian government left the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act.  Germany  Compared with other EU countries, Germany's drug policy is considered progressive, but still stricter than, for example, the Netherlands. In 1994 the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that drug addiction was not a crime, nor was the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use. In 2000, Germany changed the narcotic law (\\"BtmG\\") to allow supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, they started a pilot study in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of heroin-assisted treatment on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009. India Indonesia  Like many other governments in Southeast Asia, the Indonesian government applies severe laws to discourage drug use. Liberia Liberia prohibits drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. Its drug laws are enforced by the Drug Enforcement Agency.DEA Destroys Over LD$10 Million Drugs, AllAfrica, 2011-10-04. Accessed 2012-06-03. Netherlands  Cannabis coffee shop in the city center of Amsterdam, Netherlands Drug policy in the Netherlands is based on two principles: that drug use is a health issue, not a criminal issue, and that there is a distinction between hard and soft drugs. The Netherlands is currently the only country to have implemented a wide scale, but still regulated, decriminalisation of marijuana. It was also one of the first countries to introduce heroin-assisted treatment and safe injection sites. From 2008, a number of town councils have closed many so called coffee shops that sold cannabis or implemented other new restrictions for sale of cannabis, e.g. for foreigners.AFP: Dutch towns close coffee shops in 'drug tourists' crackdown, Oct 24, 2008 Importing and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is for hard drugs, or a maximum of 4 years for importing or exporting large quantities of cannabis. Investment in treatment and prevention of drug addiction is high when compared to the rest of the world. The Netherlands spends significantly more per capita than all other countries in the EU on drug law enforcement. 75% of drug-related public spending is on law enforcement. Drug use remains at average Western European levels and slightly lower than in English speaking countries.  Peru  According to article 8 of the Constitution of Peru, the state is responsible for battling and punishing drug trafficking. Likewise, it regulates the use of intoxicants. Consumption of drugs is not penalized and possession is allowed for small quantities only. Production and distribution of drugs are illegal. In 1993, Peru, along with Ecuador, signed the Andean Trade Preference Agreement with the United States, later replaced with the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act. Bolivia and Colombia had already signed the ATPA in 1991, and began enjoying its benefits in 1992. By agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, these countries worked in concert with the United States to fight drug trafficking and production at the source. The Act aimed to substitute the production of the coca plant with other agricultural products. In return for their efforts towards eradication of the coca plant, the countries were granted U.S. tariff exemptions on certain products, such as certain types of fruit. Peru ceased complying with the ATPA in 2012, and lost all tariff exemptions previously granted by the United States through the ATPA. By the end of 2012, Peru overtook Colombia as the world's largest cultivator of the coca plant. Portugal In July 2001, a law maintained the status of illegality for using or possessing any drug for personal use without authorization. The offense was however changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the possessing was no more than up to ten days' supply of that substance.EMCDDA: Drug policy profiles, Portugal, June 2011 This was in line with the de facto Portuguese drug policy before the reform. Drug addicts were then aggressively targeted with therapy or community service rather than fines or waivers.\\"Portugal legalizes drug use\\". BBC News. 7 July 2000. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/823257.stm. Retrieved 21 August 2009. Even if there are no criminal penalties, these changes did not legalize drug use in Portugal. Possession has remained prohibited by Portuguese law, and criminal penalties are still applied to drug growers, dealers and traffickers. Russia Drugs became popular in Russia among soldiers and the homeless, particularly due to the First World War. This included morphine-based drugs and cocaine, which were readily available. The government under Tsar Nicholas II of Russia had outlawed alcohol in 1914 (including vodka) as a temporary measure until the conclusion of the War. Following the Russian Revolution and in particular the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks emerged victorious as the new political power in Russia. The Soviet Union inherited a population with widespread drug addiction, and in the 1920s, tried to tackle it by introducing a 10-year prison sentence for drug-dealers. The Bolsheviks also decided in August 1924 to re-introduce the sale of vodka, which, being more readily available, led to a drop in drug-use.  Sweden  Sweden's drug policy has gradually turned from lenient in the 1960s with an emphasis on drug supply towards a policy of zero tolerance against all illicit drug use (including cannabis). The official aim is a drug-free society. Drug use became a punishable crime in 1988. Personal use does not result in jail time if not combined with driving a car.Lawline: P√•f√∂ljd vid ringa narkotikabrott, 2007-04-21 Prevention includes widespread drug testing, and penalties range from fines for minor drug offenses up to a 10-year prison sentence for aggravated offenses. The condition for suspended sentences could be regular drug tests or submission to rehabilitation treatment. Drug treatment is free of charge and provided through the health care system and the municipal social services. Drug use that threatens the health and development of minors could force them into mandatory treatment if they don't apply voluntarily. If the use threatens the immediate health or the security of others (such as a child of an addict) the same could apply to adults. Among 9th year students, drug experimentation was highest in the early 1970s, falling towards a low in the late 1980s, redoubling in the 1990s to stabilize and slowly decline in 2000s. Estimates of heavy drug addicts have risen from 6000 in 1967 to 15000 in 1979, 19000 in 1992 and 26000 in 1998. According to inpatient data, there were 28000 such addicts in 2001 and 26000 in 2004, but these last two figures may represent the recent trend in Sweden towards out- patient treatment of drug addicts rather than an actual decline in drug addictions.CAN:Drug Trends in Sweden 2007, page 7-11 The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the Western world, and attributes this to a drug policy that invests heavily in prevention and treatment as well as strict law enforcement.UNODC: Sweden's successful drug policy, 2007 The general drug policy is supported by all political parties and, according to opinion polls made in the mid 2000s, the restrictive approach received broad support from the public at that time.European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction: National report Sweden, 2006 NATIONAL DRUG POLICY: SWEDEN Prepared for The Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs, Canada 2002. Switzerland The national drug policy of Switzerland was developed in the early 1990s and comprises the four elements of prevention, therapy, harm reduction and prohibition. In 1994 Switzerland was one of the first countries to try heroin-assisted treatment and other harm reduction measures like supervised injection rooms. In 2008 a popular initiative by the right wing Swiss People's Party aimed at ending the heroin program was rejected by more than two thirds of the voters. A simultaneous initiative aimed at legalizing marijuana was rejected at the same ballot. Between 1987 and 1992, illegal drug use and sales were permitted in Platzspitz park, Zurich, in an attempt to counter the growing heroin problem. However, as the situation grew increasingly out of control, authorities were forced to close the park. Thailand Thailand has a strict drug policy. Control of narcotic substances is carried out in accordance with the Law on Combating Drugs of 1979. The use, storage, transportation and distribution of drugs is illegal. The maximum penalty for the distribution or possession of drugs is the death penalty. According to Thai law, drugs are divided into 5 categories:http://thailawforum.com/tourst-guide-laws-Thailand-4.html I - heroin, amphetamines, methamphetamines. II - morphine, cocaine, ketamine, codeine, opium and opium medicinal, methadone. III - drugs that legally contain category II ingredients. IV - chemicals used to make categories I and II drugs, such as anhydride and acetyl chloride. V - cannabis, plant Kratom, a hallucinogenic fungus. It is also illegal to import more than 200 cigarettes per person to Thailand. Control takes place at customs at the airport. If the limit has been exceeded, the owner can be fined up to ten times the cost of cigarettes. In January 2018, Thai authorities imposed a ban on smoking on beaches in some tourist areas. Those who smoke in public places can be punished with a fine of 100,000 Baht or imprisonment for up to one year. It is forbidden to import electronic cigarettes into Thailand. These items are likely to be confiscated, and you can be fined or sent to prison for up to 10 years. The sale or supply of electronic cigarettes and similar devices is also prohibited and is punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to 5 years.https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/local-laws-and-customs It is worth noting that most people arrested for possessing a small amount of substances from the V-th category are fined and not imprisoned. At present, in Thailand, the anti-drug police are considering methamphetamines as a more serious and dangerous problem.http://www.thailawforum.com/history-of- marijuana-cannabis-thailand.html Ukraine Crimes in the sphere of trafficking in narcotic, psychotropic substances and crimes against health are classified using the 13th section of the Criminal Code of Ukraine; articles from 305 to 327.https://meget.kiev.ua/kodeks/ugolovniy-kodeks/razdel-1-13/ According to official statistics for 2016, 53% of crimes in the field of drugs fall on art. 309 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: \\"illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation or shipment of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues without the purpose of sale\\". Sentence for crime:http://alfa-omega.kh.ua/otvetstvennost-za- upotreblenie-narkotikov/ * fine of fifty to one hundred non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens; * or correctional labor for up to two years; * or arrest for up to six months, or restriction of liberty for up to three years; * or imprisonment for the same term. On August 28, 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a strategy for state policy on drugs until 2020. This is the first document of this kind in Ukraine. The strategy developed by the State Drug Control Service, involves strengthening criminal liability for distributing large amounts of drugs, and easing the penalty for possession of small doses. Thanks to this strategy, it is planned to reduce the number of injecting drug users by 20% by 2020, and the number of drug overdose deaths by 30%.https://zn.ua/UKRAINE/v-ukraine-vpervye-razrabotana-gosudarstvennaya- strategiya-v-otnoshenii-narkotikov-128148_.html In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. The corresponding licenses were obtained by the USA company C21. She is also in the process of applying for additional licenses, including the cultivation of hemp.  United Kingdom  Drugs considered addictive or dangerous in the United Kingdom (with the exception of tobacco and alcohol) are called \\"controlled substances\\" and regulated by law. Until 1964 the medical treatment of dependent drug users was separated from the punishment of unregulated use and supply. This arrangement was confirmed by the Rolleston Committee in 1926. This policy on drugs, known as the \\"British system\\", was maintained in Britain, and nowhere else, until the 1960s. Under this policy drug use remained low; there was relatively little recreational use and few dependent users, who were prescribed drugs by their doctors as part of their treatment. From 1964 drug use was increasingly criminalised, with the framework still in place largely determined by the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act.An Analysis of UK Drug Policy - A Monograph Prepared for the UK Drug Policy Commission, Peter Reuter, University of Maryland, Alex Stevens, University of Kent, April 2007  United States  Modern US drug policy still has roots in the war on drugs started by president Richard Nixon in 1971. In the United States, illegal drugs fall into different categories and punishment for possession and dealing varies on amount and type. Punishment for marijuana possession is light in most states, but punishment for dealing and possession of hard drugs can be severe, and has contributed to the growth of the prison population. US drug policy is also heavily invested in foreign policy, supporting military and paramilitary actions in South America, Central Asia, and other places to eradicate the growth of coca and opium. In Colombia, U.S. president Bill Clinton dispatched military and paramilitary personnel to interdict the planting of coca, as a part of the Plan Colombia. The project is often criticized for its ineffectiveness and its negative impact on local farmers, but it has been effective in destroying the once-powerful drug cartels and guerrilla groups of Colombia. President George W. Bush intensified anti-drug efforts in Mexico, initiating the M√©rida Initiative, but has faced criticisms for similar reasons. May 21, 2012 the U.S Government published an updated version of its Drug PolicyPrinciples of Modern Drug Policy . Whitehouse.gov. The director of ONDCP stated simultaneously that this policy is something different than \\"War on Drugs\\": *The U.S Government see the policy as a ‚Äúthird way‚Äù approach to drug control one that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world‚Äôs preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse. *The policy does not see drug legalization as the ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù solution to drug control. *It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.Statement of the Government of the United States of America World Federation Against Drugs 3rd World Forum, May 21, 2012, Stockholm, Sweden .

The film stars Kiron Kher, Amrish Puri, Rajit Kapur and Rajeshwari Sachdev. The film's lead actress Kiron Kher won the 1997 National Film Award - Special Jury Award. Rajeshwari Sachdev won the 1997 National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. This film focuses on the complex portrait of family relationships, generational and sexual politics as well as social mores in India.Sardari Begum at imagineindia  Plot  The police are called to investigate the death of a woman during a riot in the walled city of Delhi.Overview New York Times. She was killed by a stone thrown by an agitated mob. The woman killed is known in the community as \\"Sardari Begum\\" (Kiron Kher), a popular singer and courtesan. The religious nature of the incident and the impending elections combine to attract the media's attention. When a young reporter covering the funeral, Tehzeeb Abbasi (Rajina Raj Bisaria), discovers her father among the mourners, her curiosity prompts her to investigate further. Then comes the revelation that the singer was in fact her aunt, who was disowned by her family for rebelliously learning music from a concubine. The reporter Tehzeeb finds the life of her aunt intriguing and exciting, having an opinion that is totally opposite to her father Jabbar. the brother of dead Sardari Begum. Although he loved and cared for her, he didn't support her ideals, her freedom, her passion for singing. At Tehzeeb's residence, Jabbar tells his daughter about the stubbornness of his elder sister yet also confessing his love for her as she was his only sister. The film goes into flashback where Sardari refuses to take money back she had given to Jabbar for Tehzeeb's education. Jabbar wants to return the money as he thinks it was a debt while Sardari regards it as a gift for Tehzeeb. The argument ends with Jabbar leaving Sardari's home swearing never to come back again. He also narrates how the younger Sardari(Smriti Mishra) turned rebellious in order to pursue her passion for singing when it was not approved by her father. Having Inspired by her story, Tehzeeb decides to dig deeper in her late aunt's life. She decides to write a long article in her memory in the newspaper she works but her editor doesn't not approve. It is revealed that Tehzeeb is in a relationship with her editor boss who is happily married with two kids. Tehzeeb continues her journey interviewing every person who was related to her aunt or knew her closely. However, Sardari's daughter Sakheena does not oblige Tehzeeb's request and ignores her. Tehzeeb finds out about the fateful night when Sardari ran away from home in Agra. She went to Ittan Bai(Surekha Sikri), who refuses to give her shelter and asks her to go home. Sardari then makes her way at Hemraj's (Amrish Puri) house. Hemraj is a Zamindar who leads a colorful life. Although he is married, he keeps attending gatherings led by courtesans primarily at Ittan Bai where Sardari used to perform. Hemraj felt attracted towards Sardari which is why Sardari approach him and asks for shelter. Hemraj takes Sardari in his house and holds gatherings for her so she can continue her singing. Hemraj's wife (Uttara Baokar) dislikes her totally and does not like her closeness with her husband. Meanwhile, Fateh Khan (S.M.Zaheer) who plays sitar and other musical instruments at Ittan Bai's court was highly impressed with Sardari's talent. After he leaves Iqbal Bai, he continues to support Sardari Begum in her future concerts at Hemraj's house and later in Delhi. Meanwhile, Sadiq Moosvi (Rajit Kapur) a friend of Hemraj and a regular attendee at his gatherings is immensely attracted to Sardari. Initially, Sardari does not react to his feelings but slowly when she realizes that Hemraj only lusts for her and does not respect her singing talent, also not want her to grow as an artist, she starts to fall for Sadiq. Sadiq convinces Sardari to come with him to Delhi so that her voice can be popular and she would become famous. Sadiq also comes to know that Sardari is pregnant with Hemraj's child however he has no obligations to accept both. Sardari and Sadiq comes to Delhi and marry in a private ceremony. Sadiq takes Sardari to a record label company where the company's director Mr Sen(Salim Ghouse) falls for Sardari's voice and gets mesmerized by her charm and beauty. From there, Sardari becomes immensely popular as a 'thumri' artist singer known for her passionate voice and singing. For eight years, she reigns supreme and at the top of her game. Meanwhile, she gives birth to her daughter Sakeena (Rajeshwari Sachdev) After few years, differences start to crop up between Sardari and Sadiq. While Sardari slowly loses interest in regular singing and recordings. Sadiq uses her money for his own purposes. One day, when one of Sardari's recording gets cancelled, Mr Sen feels disappointed at Sardari's unprofessionalism. Sadiq tries to reason with him and invites him to his home to have a talk with his wife. At home, Sardari and Sadiq gets into a major argument and Sardari throws Sadiq out of the house. She feels cheated by her husband as he exploited her talent, passion and money for his own investments and purposes and was never cared for her otherwise. Mr Sen who comes to the house witnessing the drama and feels sorry for Sadiq. However, he felt Sadiq was never the right person for Sardari. Mr Sen was also in love with Sardari, At one visit he asks her to sing some ghazals and ultimately proposes her for marriage. Sardari considers Mr Sen a nice man but she does not feel eligible to remarry. She also feels that her passion for music is above all and she can't sacrifice it for anything. Mr Sen accepts all her conditions but gets reluctant to accept Sakina as his own daughter. Sardari rejects the proposal as she can't be detached with her daughter. Mr Sen later repents for not accepting Sakina. At the same time, Sardari Begum's popularity goes down as a singer and she stops performing for record labels and singing functions. The situation comes to a point where Sardari has to make money through arranging marriages of unknown couples to run her household. Tehzeeb finally approaches Sakeena for her interview but she rejects her request. On seeing her dejected, Tehzeeb narrates her story. She tells Sakeena that she and her father are no longer on talking terms. She is in love with a married man and her father will never accept him. Also he refuses to believe that he would sacrifice his married life for her. Moved by this, Sakeena narrates her part. She tells that Sardari Begum was not the woman which people knew. For them she was an artist, a glorious artist, the famous thumri singer but as the real Sardari she was limited as a woman. She never allowed Sakeena to pursue education, or chat with men. She was not allowed to call 'Sardari' as Amma [Mom] as it would hide her age. Sakeena calls her Appa'Bi [Elder Sister]. Sardari forced her talent and musical knowledge in establishing Sakeena as the next Sardari which clearly Sakeena was not meant to be. No one ever bothered about Sakeena's hopes and ambitions. Sakeena narrates an incident where Tehzeeb's father visits them and storms out of the house after an argument with Sardari. Enraged by this, Sakeena calls out 'Sardari' as an arrogant and selfish woman. After the incident, Sakeena stops talking to her and even stops her singing. Now the film comes to the present where Sardari is practicing her singing when she hears a ruckus and goes out to witness and suddenly a stone thrown from the agitated mob hits her hard. Sardari calls out Sakeena who gets devastated to see her mother dying. Sardari asks Sakeena if she was a good mother to her to which Sakeena replies positively. Sardari then asks Sakeena to sing one last time for her to which Sakeena obliges. Sardari succumbs to her injuries and dies. Inspired by her aunt's story, Tehzeeb sends the article to a different newspaper for publishing which she reports to her lover editor. She also breaks ties with him and re-unites with her father. At the end, Sardari's daughter Sakeena is seen practicing singing thus signifying that she would continue to live with mother's legacy as a great singer.

However could not maintain her success long enough because of the circumstances that prevailed in her life. Adding to the miseries was her attitude and stubbornness. Although she was known to be a noble lady and a good woman from heart, she would be misunderstood at most times. Sardari rebelled at a young age for her passion for music when her father stopped her learning. Her talent and deep love for music challenged the society where women are meant to follow traditional values. Sardari gets disowned from her family however she doesn't have any hard feelings. Sardari's talent was recognized and she became a huge classical singing star but could not maintain her success. Even when her career was fading, Sardari would not oblige to sing songs having awkward and meaningless lyrics. Sardari would not allow her own daughter to pursue education or get married as she wanted her to take her legacy further. At one time Sardari even had to arrange marriages of unknown couples in order to run her household but her pride of being the most accomplished Thumri Singer never got affected. She was a bold, straightforward, no-nonsense strong lady who struggled to fight for her own identity in a very tough world. As an accomplished singer, her rise to stardom and ill-fated death makes a compelling story for generations to come. The film has been beautifully directed by renowned film director Shyam Benegal. At the time of its release, the film didn't have much of buzz and released without much publicity but critics appreciated the film a lot and felt it was way ahead of its time. The music by Vanraj Bhatia deserves a special mention who composed some of the most memorable 'thumri' numbers for the film.

They enable organizations to put their unsolved problems and unmet needs, which are framed as ‚ÄòChallenges‚Äô, out to the crowd to address. In the case of InnoCentive, the crowd can either be external (i.e., their network of over 380,000 problem solvers) or internal (i.e., an organization's employees, partners or customers). Awards, typically monetary, are given for submissions that meet the requirements set out in the Challenge description. The average award amount for a Challenge is $20,000 but some offer awards of over $100,000. To date, InnoCentive have run over 2,000 external Challenges and over 1,000 internal Challenges, awarding over $20 million in the process. History The idea for InnoCentive came to Alpheus Bingham and Aaron Schacht in 1998 while they worked together at Eli Lilly and Company during a session that was focused on exploring application of the Internet to business. The company was launched in 2001 by Jill Panetta, Jeff Hensley, Darren Carroll and Alpheus Bingham, with majority seed funding from Eli Lilly and Company. Darren Carroll led the launch effort and became the first CEO. In 2005, InnoCentive was spun out of Eli Lilly with investments led by Spencer Trask of New York. In December 2006, shortly after Dwayne Spradlin took the helm as CEO, the company signed an agreement with the Rockefeller Foundation to add a non- profit area designed to generate science and technology solutions to pressing problems in the developing world. Between 2006 and 2009, The Rockefeller Foundation posted 10 challenges on InnoCentive with an 80% success rate. In 2006, Prize4Life partnered with InnoCentive to launch the $1 million ALS Biomarker Prize, which was a Grand Challenge designed to find a biomarker to measure the progression of ALS ‚Äì also known as Lou Gehrig's disease ‚Äì in patients. In February 2011, the $1 million prize was awarded to Dr. Seward Rutkove for his creation and validation of a clinically viable biomarker. In early 2011, InnoCentive launched four more Grand Challenges on behalf of Life Technologies. In February 2012, InnoCentive acquired UK-based OmniCompete. Products and services= Premium Challenges  Premium Challenges allow organizations to post their problems and needs to InnoCentive's problem solver network through the InnoCentive.com platform. Typically this process begins with a workshop led by InnoCentive in which appropriate problems and needs are identified. InnoCentive's PhD-educated Challenge Experts then work with clients to decompose and formulate the problem or need as a Challenge. The problem or need is abstracted to allow for insights across industries, perhaps even one that shares the problem and has already solved it. The Challenge description clearly defines the problem or need, the solution and Intellectual Property requirements, and the award amount that will be paid out for winning submissions. Challenges are posted, anonymously if the client desires, on InnoCentive.com. Typically users will submit their solutions over a period of 30 to 90 days. Deliverables vary depending on the type of Challenge and can range from short proposals to experimentally validated solutions. After the client has finished evaluating the submissions and selecting the winners, InnoCentive handles the administration of award payments and IP transfers or licensing.  Custom Challenges  Custom Challenges come in two forms: Grand Challenges, which are high-profile Challenge programs that focus on a large problem, often calling for radical innovations and breakthrough solutions, and Showcase Challenges, which tend to focus on a specific sector and typically involve a live event.  InnoCentive@Work  InnoCentive is a SaaS-based open innovation platform that allows organizations to run private, internally focused Challenge programs that engage their employees, partners or customers. The platform can be customized and branded as required. Employees are able to comment and vote on their colleagues‚Äô ideas, suggest ideas for Challenges, and participate in discussions on suggested Challenges and awarded submissions. The awards mechanism works slightly differently to Premium Challenges, tying into the organisation's existing benefits program, for example. User base As of September 2017, there were over 380,000 users from nearly 200 countries in InnoCentive's problem solver network. All users have separately and specifically registered with InnoCentive and report expertise in a variety of fields including chemistry, life sciences, engineering, statistics, information technology, food and crop science and business. Nearly 60% are educated to Masters Level or above. InnoCentive have a number of partnerships that allow their clients access millions more users.  Success rates  In 2016, 80% of Premium Challenges were awarded. A study conducted by Forrester Consulting found that \\"the hygiene and health company Essity received a Return on Investment of 74% with a payback period of less than 3 months from their work with InnoCentive\\".

It was the center of fine living and society, and ‚Äúthe symbol of ultimate glamour and cosmopolitan sophistication at that time.‚Äù The symbol of the New York lifestyle in \\"Paul's Case\\" is the luxurious Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The descriptions of New York City contrast the descriptions of Paul's home, Pittsburgh, which he despises. Paul, a Pittsburgh high school student, is frustrated with his dull middle-class life. This frustration mixed with a desire of a luxurious lifestyle makes Paul anxious to make a perfect way of living. This causes him to purposely separate himself from everyone else leading to feelings of isolation. Paul could also display signs of depression due to personal experiences. His attitude with himself and others could be an indication of the effects Paul faced from his mothers death. Paul is uninterested in many things, and struggles with his emotions. While his appreciation of the arts is more social and superficial than aesthetic, he dreams of another life in which he would attend concerts and theater. For example, he enjoys a symphony concert not so much for the music, but for the atmosphere: \\"the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor.\\" Later on in the story, he steals money from where he works to support a short escapade in New York City. Once he exhausts his funds and his father catches wind of what has happened, he commits suicide by jumping in front of a train rather than allow his father to take him back to Pittsburgh. Paul's teachers and father refer to Paul as a \\"case\\", representing him at a distance and as an example of someone to be studied, handled, and managed; the term enables Cather to adopt \\"the voice of medical authority.\\" Paul seems to display some symptoms of a narcissistic personality disorder but that is still in high debate. Plot summary The short story ‚ÄúPaul‚Äôs Case,‚Äù is about a young boy who struggles to fit in at home and in school. The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \\"defiant manner\\" in class and the \\"physical aversion\\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience soon learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is full of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so. Paul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher. Paul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from San Francisco who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream. However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.  Symbolism  Flowers: Flowers, such as a red carnation and violets, appear many times throughout the story. Since Paul sees everything as dull and boring, the flowers represent the desire that he has to find the beauty in life.Cather, Willa, and Karl Schlenk. Paul's case. Westermann, 1963. The red carnation has also been found to be representative of Paul's detachment from society. Sherry Crabtree (2000) Cather's PAUL'S CASE, The Explicator, 58:4, 206-208, DOI: 10.1080/00144940009597047 Embroidered hanging done by Paul's mother: This could represent Paul's yearning for love since both love and his mother are absent from his life. Paul's suicide: Paul's decision to end his life by jumping in front of a train is thought to represent the impact that commercialization and industrialization have on Paul; who would rather lose himself in theater and music. Paul's choice to get hit by a train as his method of suicide also reflects his relationship with his father. Paul has the opportunity to use a gun to end his life; however, the gun belongs to his father. Paul had always feared his father, his choice to not use the gun shows that Paul doesn't want to give his father any more power over his life. He lived in the fear that his dad was going to kill him with that gun, his choice to not use it shows he is trying to distance himself and be different than his father. Snowfall: Cather utilizes extensive imagery related to snowfall throughout \\"Paul's Case\\" in order to represent the coming of a richer lifestyle. The \\"whirling\\" motions of said snowfall occur several times; as Paul gazes out of the train window on his way to New York, as well as consistently throughout the time he is actually in the city. It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself. Note that on his way back from New York, he gazes out of the train window to see nothing of the sort besides the snow that has already fallen - A depressing representation that Paul's fantasy has come to an end. Paul's Smile: There are several instances where Paul's smile is brought up in the story and a few different interpretations of what his smile symbolizes. When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors. Paul's smile in this circumstance displays his cocky attitude and shows that he doesn't care about what the authorities have to say to him. A different interpretation of Paul's smile arises from the detail where Paul's drawing master claimed there was, \\"something sort of haunted about [his smile],\\" which is a detail that is often used to support the idea that Paul's smile refers to him having a disability. The Basement: During the story, Paul sneaks into his home through his basement and reflects on his relationship with his father. The condition of the basement has been found to represent the dark, antagonistic bond the two share. Martha Czernicki (2017) Fantasy and Reality in Willa Cather's PAUL'S CASE, The Explicator, 75:4, 242-247, DOI: 10.1080/00144940.2017.1379466 Carnegie Hall: In the story, Paul works as an usher at Carnegie Hall where he shows his true personality and optimistic spirit. Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater. This place may have given him the approval he was looking for in his household. Paul showed to have this love for the theatre but then had to hide it when he got home, \\"It was at the theatre and at Carnegie Hall that Paul really lived;\\". Paul felt at home and comfortable when he was at the theatre, which he could not find in his real home with his father. Foreshadowing The foreshadowing demonstrated in \\"Paul's Case\\" is seen in the carnations that Paul wears. Immediately before Paul kills himself, the carnations were \\"drooping with the cold...their red glory all over\\". The carnations symbolize Paul, so when the flowers die and are buried in the snow, it is hinting to the reader that Paul is about to die. it lay on his dressing- table now; he had got it out last night when he came blindly up from dinner, but the shiny metal hurt his eyes, and he disliked the looks of the thing. Literary criticism and significance Paul's Case has been called a \\"gay suicide\\" for multiple reasons, including Paul's lack of a relationship with his father and the absence of a mother figure.Eric Haralson, Henry James and Queer Modernity, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 137 Many critics have attributed his suicide to the forces of alienation and stigmatization facing a young homosexual man in early 20th-century America. In 1975, Larry Rubin wrote The Homosexual Motif which includes the reinterpretation of the story since the stigma on sex has eased. He identifies the hints dropped throughout the story that would lead the reader to believe Paul was homosexual. For example, the way Paul dresses. The violet water (a perfume Paul owns), and his choice of company are all pointed out by Larry Ruben as signs of feminine tendencies. Jane Nardin also explores the possibility that Paul's character is gay, and that this is a metaphor for a general feeling of being an outsider or not fitting in with a specific group of people. Author Roger Austen states that Paul might be portrayed as a homosexual character because of the \\"depiction of a sensitive young man stifled by the drab ugliness of his environment and places the protagonist in an American literary tradition of \\"village sissies.\\" Paul has shown multiple signs of PTSD, a few are: ‚Äúefforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, and conversations,‚Äù ‚Äúefforts to avoid activities, places and people that arouse recollections,‚Äù and considering the idea of his ‚Äúforeshortened future‚Ä¶ not expected to have a normal life span‚Äù (Obertino 50). By, him going to New York to avoid his father and escape from his father who showed no pity, he displayed signs of PTSD. Wayne Koestenbaum reads the story as a possible portrait of Willa Cather's \\"own desire for aesthetic fulfillment and sexual nonconformity.\\" He also identifies the literary topos of opera queendom, commingled here as it often is with a suicidal sense of self-loss. Another critic, Tom Quirk, reads it as an exploration of Cather's belief in the \\"irreconcilable opposition\\" between art and life. James Obertino of the University of Central Missouri and Rob Saari suggest that Paul displays several characteristics that suggest symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder according to the DSM-IV. Obertino also suggests that Paul may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Some signs that Obertino uses to suggest Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Paul are: \\"Diminished interest in significant activities\\", and \\"feelings of detachment or estrangement from others\\" as well as constant daydreaming from reality. Rubin also emphasizes Paul's detachment, which he calls \\"alienation.\\" An Oxford Academic article highlights important signs of PTSD that Paul can relate to. Saari suggests Paul is \\"a prototypical case\\" of narcissistic personality disorder, as he meets nine out of nine criteria from the DSM-IV. Saari also suggests that because of this disorder, Paul needs to associate with people of a higher class. Saari, Rob. ‚Äú‚ÄòPaul's Case‚Äô: A Narcissistic Personality Disorder, 301.81.‚Äù Studies in Short Fiction, vol. 34, no. 3, 1997. 389‚Äì95. Another thing Saari states is that Paul \\"shows traits of vanity\\" to explain how full of himself he is and to connect it to narcissistic personality disorder. Hayley Wilhelm of the University of New Haven, suggests the possibility that Paul has autism due to certain signs and symptoms he displays throughout the story. According to Wilhelm, when looking at the diagnostic criteria for autism provided by the American Psychiatric Association, Paul could be demonstrating actions or mannerisms that fall into the criteria. Some signs that he may have autism could be his ease with lying, his motor tics (twitching lips, raised eyebrows), and his sensitivity to touch. In Modern Fiction Studies, writer Claude J. Summers suggests that Cather, herself being homosexual, chose to depict Paul as being homosexual due to her relationship with author Oscar Wilde. Wilde, an early critic of Cather's work, inspired several aspects of Cather's work on \\"Paul's Case.\\" Martha Czernicki of the University of New Haven suggests that Paul's trip to New York is a fantasy. Because of certain hints throughout the story and how fast Paul's life progresses after the night in the basement, he could have been dreaming and fantasizing about the life he wanted as a method of mentally escaping what was happening in his real life. Adaptations The story was the basis for a chamber opera in two acts with music by Gregory Spears to a libretto by Spears and Kathryn Walat. It premiered in April 2013 at the Artisphere in Washington, D.C. and was then performed for the PROTOTYPE opera festival in New York City, performed at HERE, 145 6th Avenue. The story of Paul's Case was adapted into a TV movie in 1980, directed by Lamont Johnson, starring Eric Roberts. Paul's Case was also released as a book-on-tape by HarperCollins in 1981.

While Harvey Milk invariably draws comparisons to the Melvins, due to their penchant for slow, heavy riffs, the band has touched upon such artists as ZZ Top, Led Zeppelin, Leonard Cohen, and Kiss as influences in their music. They even went so far as to perform a live show consisting of nothing but Hank Williams covers. One April Fool's Day gig at the 40 Watt in Athens, they performed R.E.M.'s Reckoning album from beginning to end, while Michael Stipe was in attendance. History Harvey Milk formed in 1992, naming themselves after Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician elected in a major U.S. city. Originally a trio of Creston Spiers, Stephen Tanner, and Paul Trudeau, the band released one album, My Love Is Higher Than Your Assessment of What My Love Could Be, before Trudeau left in 1996. They disbanded in 1998 but reformed in 2006. On June 3, 2008, Harvey Milk released Life... The Best Game in Town. The band toured the eastern and southern US as well as Germany, England, Belgium, France and Scotland during the Summer of 2008. Life...

It was founded in 1964 as a segregation academy. The campus is located within the rural Piedmont region of central Virginia. History Amelia Academy was founded in 1964 during Virginia's policy of massive resistance to court-mandated integration of public schools. At this time most of the white students in Amelia County transferred to the new Amelia Academy as a segregation academy. Like many such schools, Amelia Academy had its tax- exempt status suspended by the Internal Revenue Service in the early 1970s due to its racially discriminatory admission policies. The school has since regained its tax-exempt status as it has continually integrated. Amelia Academy regained its tax-exempt status in 1985. However, in February 1986 the Internal Revenue Service announced that it was opening an investigation to determine whether the Amelia Academy and two other Virginia private schools had, in fact, abandoned racial discrimination in admissions. In April 1986 the IRS announced that both the Amelia Academy and the Isle of Wight Academy would have their tax exemptions revoked. As of 1988, no Black student had ever attended the school. In May of that year, headmistress Dallas De K. Lewis told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that \\"We have an open-door policy. We'd be delighted if we could get some other races.\\" In 1993, the school's lack of integration was the subject of controversy when gubernatorial candidate George Allen attended a school fundraiser and was surprised to discover that it was all-white. 1993 gubernatorial election Amelia Academy was briefly in the news during the 1993 Virginia gubernatorial campaign. Republican candidates George Allen and Michael Farris attended a picnic at the school. Both men later denied knowing that the event was a fundraiser for the school, that the school had been founded as a segregation academy, and that the student body at the time was all white. At the time, headmistress Lewis told The Washington Post that the Academy \\"has always had an open-door policy,\\" and that anyone who met admissions standards was welcome to attend. She also noted that the school had not yet regained its tax-exempt status from the IRS, and recalled that, although the Academy had had a Korean student during the IRS investigation, the investigator noted that \\"we may have met the letter of the law but because we had no blacks, we didn't meet the spirit of the law.\\" Peter Eliades, unsuccessful Virginia Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, also attended the event. His campaign manager told the Times- Dispatch \\"I had absolutely no idea there was any connection...with a segregation academy. If there is a connection, we are appalled. We condemn any kind of discrimination.\\" (ellipsis in original quote) Athletics Amelia Academy is a member of the Virginia Commonwealth Conference (VCC). Their teams are known as \\"The Patriots.\\" Other member schools are Blessed Sacrament Huguenot, Brunswick Academy, Fuqua School, Isle of Wight Academy, Richmond Christian School, Southampton Academy, and Tidewater Academy. The boys‚Äô basketball squad won the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association (VISAA) Championship, as well as the VCC regular season and conference tournament three times between 2011 and 2013.

His grandfather, He Song, a feng shui master, was originally from Jiangxi but moved to Foshan in Guangdong, China. His father, Eu Kong Pui (a.k.a. Eu Kong) became a Chinese immigrant from Foshan and went to Penang to work as a grocery shop assistant and later laid the foundation for his son's fortune by starting tin mining and other businesses.Three Kings, MOTORING NEWS & CAR REVIEWS, The Highway, May, 2002 Tong Sen's mother Leong Lay Yong stayed in Foshan until brought to Penang, where Eu Kong had married a second wife Mun Woon Chang who was well-connected in Malaya,‰ΩôÊù±ÊóãÂÆ∂ÊóèËàá‰Ωô‰ªÅÁîü (2) ‰ΩôÂª£ÂüπÂ£ØÂπ¥ÁóÖÈÄù and where he died prematurely in 1890Song Ong Siang (1923) One Hundred Years' History of the Chinese in Singapore.London : J. Murray; p. 332, 333 at the age of 38. Eu built his fortune by acquiring from the British, monopolies for tax or revenue farming (opium, alcohol or spirits, gambling and pawn broking) in Perak in the 1880s and when tin started to boom, he acquired land for mining tin. He expanded this to retailing and taxing goods from China that he sold to the miners he employed and set up a grocery shop in Gopeng that was later expanded to include a Chinese dispensary for Chinese immigrants. He operated his businesses under the mark Chop Yan Sang. He had two younger brothers, Eu Kong Chun and Eu Kong Tak. His business partner was Chiu Tong Hin and his attorney was Grant Mackie of the Straits Trading Company. While he was still a child, Eu Tong Sen had been sent back to his mother in Foshan, China, to study. However, with the sudden death of his father, he found himself, at only 13, heir to the family estates and tin mining businesses. He returned to Malaya in 1892 but his stay with his two uncles and his stepmother was short. He moved to the home of R. Butler and lived there for two and a half years, taking private tuition in English from F. W. Harley. From there he moved to Ipoh and enrolled in a government school. Later he would move to Singapore where he lived for some time before moving to Hong Kong when business conditions changed. In 1898, at the age of 21, he took over his father's estate from Grant Mackie and discovered the business to be in decline. Over the next ten years he was to expand the family business and multiply his fortune many times over. He expanded his business empire in Singapore, Malaya and Hong Kong and, at 30, was one of the richest men in the region. In Malaya and the Straits, when tax farming was abolished and tin prices started to fall, Eu ventured into rubber plantations in British Malaya and remittances between Malaya and Hong Kong.  Chung Thye Phin and Eu Tong Sen  Eu and Chung Thye Phin, the Kapitan China of Perak, were \\"blood\\" brothers. They went through Chinese ceremony to become oath brothers. When Chung travelled to Hong Kong, he stayed in Eu's villa there and they kept an account of his expenses in the company's account books. Eu's villa in Hong Kong was called \\"Eucliff\\". It has been torn down. It was built at Repulse Bay, overlooking the sea. The property was huge. It was built with stone like a castle. It included within its walled area a tennis court and also a swimming pool. Eucliff villa contained a statuary collection of Eu Tong Sen. When Eucliff was demolished, a statue of an anonymous World War I soldier was donated to Osborn Barracks in Kowloon where it stayed for 20 years before being relocated to Hong Kong Park. Eu and Chung had common interests ‚Äì motorcars, racehorses, country houses, etc. 1903 when the Ipoh Gymkhana Club was founded, both of them decided to enter their thoroughbreds regularly in the Ipoh races. They jointly built a weekend retreat, \\"Forest Lodge\\", at Gopeng Road with a large stable. When Eu was appointed to the Federal Council, Chung sold his half-lot to Eu, who desired grander accommodations following the latter's elevation in status. Chung, in turn, bought Drummond's Hill in Taiping, a estate and the former Residency of Sir Hugh Low. In 1908, together with Chung, Eu built a large Chinese theatre in the important mining town of Kampar near Ipoh. Chung's Penang firms served as the agent for Eu in Penang before Eu opened a branch on the island. Eu's Penang branch, at least according to business directories, was the latest in his branch office network. It seemed to have opened only in 1920. Eu and Chung were also members of the board of directors of the Eastern Smelting Company, Ltd along with Ng Boo Bee, Ong Hung Chong, Khaw Joo Tok and his nephew Khaw Bian Kee.Chinese Business Enterprise By Rajeswary Ampalavanar Brown. Published by Taylor & Francis, 1996. , . Pp 61, 62, 63, 64. Chapter 3: The Khaw group: Chinese business in early twentieth-century Penang by J. W. Cushman Traditional Chinese medicine Aside from his involvement in the tin mining and rubber industries, Eu was also responsible for extending his family business of the traditional Chinese medicine manufacturing company, Eu Yan Sang, into Hong Kong; he felt it was necessary to diversify out of the tin industry, which was coming under increasing government regulation. He transformed the business his father left him, originating from that single dispensary in Gopeng, into a chain of traditional medicine shops. In 1908 his medicine shops in Kampar and Gopeng were flourishing. Tin business At its peak, Eu's businesses owned a total of 11 mines and employed 12,000 miners. The tin business, however, was in a state of decline by the time he took over management. By 1908 he owned two mines at Kampar, three at Gopeng, one at Teronoh, one at Chenderiang, and one at Papan, together employing about 8,000 coolies. In Selangor he owned one mine at Ampang and one at Kancheng, together employing 3,000 coolies. In Batang Benna, Negeri Sembilan, he owned one mine employing 1,000 coolies. He set up the Sang Woh Foundry and extended his business into the manufacture and export of tin-made items which he shipped to China and Southeast Asian countries. Rubber business In 1908 he commenced planting two estates of 450 and and eventually grew his fathers business from their original two estates of 450 and until his rubber estates covered more than 283 hectares of land. Remittance business Eu Yan Sang shops in Gopeng and Kampar extended to providing remittance services, allowing Chinese miners and plantation workers to send their earnings home. As the remittance and medicines businesses expanded, branches were set up in Penang, Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Singapore. In 1909, Eu established a branch in the Sheung Wan district of Hong Kong. As his branches increased and his business spread out geographically, his potential market grew accordingly.Lui, 1990 In 1914, he expanded the remittance business to reach throughout Malaya as well as the Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong, and southern China. In the 1920s when the rubber business in Malaya deteriorated, Eu shifted his focus to the remittance business in Hong Kong. Eu Tong Sen Limited and Hong Kong By the late 1920s, the most profitable part of the Eu Yan Sang medicine shop business was in remittances and not medicines. Eu moved from Singapore to Hong Kong in 1928. On 7 January 1932, he formed Eu Tong Sen Limited in Singapore but controlled it from Hong Kong where his remittance business was showing the best potential. Banking In 1920, at 42, Eu, together with Wu Sing Pang, a rich Cantonese merchant in Singapore, founded the Lee Wah Bank with business operations in Guangdong, Singapore and Malaya. The bank was a \\"Cantonese\\" bank as opposed to Hokkien banks like the Ho Hong Bank etc.,The International Expansion of Singapore's Largest Banks by Adrian E. Tschoegl meaning it was set up to cater mainly to the Cantonese (or Cantonese-speaking) community. Other Commercial Interests His other commercial interests included shareholding in opium farms in Singapore and Penang. Cinema and theatre Outside of his businesses, Eu was an early admirer of the Shaw brothers (Run Run Shaw and Runme Shaw) and invited them to Singapore as his guests. He had a large family, with three wives and 25 children. He also organised and oversaw the 1928 construction on that same street of the Majestic Theatre, a performing hall for Cantonese opera, and for forming an opera troupe to perform there, all to entertain one of his wives who was a fan of Cantonese opera. Later, he would become the first non-European commoner to be admitted to the Royal Ipoh Club. Federal Council of the Federated Malay States In May 1912, Eu was appointed a permanent Unofficial Member of the Federal Council of the Federated Malay States, the seat having fallen vacant on the death of Leong Fee.Notice: \\"Downing Street, 22nd May, 1912. The Malaysian king has been pleased to approve of the nomination of Eu, Esq., to be an Unofficial Member of the Federal Council of the Federated Malay States.\\" ‚Äì The London Gazette Issue 28611 published on 24 May 1912. Page 13 of 94Ipoh Echo University of Hong Kong  Eu donated HK$55,000 to the University of Hong Kong during one of his visits there in 1918. Sports Eu took a keen interest in horse-racing, motoring and rifle-shooting. He imported the first motor car into Perak. Eu was also the pioneer of Singapore to bring in calf racing. Calf racing evolves around two men and two calves. Then, they will ride the calf through a series of obstacles before finally falling into pool of water. The men then will have to finally swim to land and run back to the starting point, the first becoming the winner. Qing government title Eu purchased an official title from the Qing Dynasty government in 1903. He sold it back in 1906. Death Eu died of a heart attack on 11 May 1941 in Hong Kong at the age of 63. However, before that fatal heart attack, Eu survived multiples of heart attacks and suffered a 5-day collapse a few times. He also had lung cancer but was cured of immediately. Legacy In 1919, Singapore's Wayang Street was renamed to Eu Tong Sen Street in his honour. The honour was given in recognition of his contributions of a scout fighter plane called No. 1 Eu Tong Sen, and 6,000 pounds for a tank that had two \\"eyes\\" to further the British efforts in World War I. Mr. Addison, the Minister of Munitions commissioned a painting of the tank and presented the painting to Eu. A description of Eu's residences in Perak, written by Herman Norden in 1923, goes as follows: > \\"Eu Tong Sen is a notable with his twenty-five millions of gold dollars.

Donation of an organ from a living person to save another's life, where the donor's health will not appreciably suffer, is permitted and encouraged in Jewish law. Donation of an organ from a dead person is equally permitted for the same purpose: to save a life (pikuach nefesh). This simple statement of the issue belies, however, the complexity of defining death in Jewish law. Thus, although there are side issues regarding mutilation of the body etc., the primary issue that prevents organ donation from the dead amongst Jews, in many cases, is the definition of death, simply because to take a life- sustaining organ from a person who was still alive would be murder. Because in Jewish law, organ donation raises such difficult questions, it has traditionally been met with some skepticism. In both Orthodox Judaism and non- Orthodox Judaism, the majority view holds that organ donation is permitted in the case of irreversible cardiac rhythm cessation. However most organs must be transplanted before the heart has ceased, and this has led to much discussion and assessment of Jewish law so that today, whilst there continues to be opposition to transplantation before cardiac/respiratory death, there are several authorities which argue that it is allowed, and this is now the official position of the government of the State of Israel and its Chief Rabbinate.  Relevant principles of Jewish Law  In judging cases for organ donation, rabbis apply a range of Jewish principles and consider precedents concerning the donor. In Judaism, almost all acts are permissible in order to save the life of another, provided the risk of that person's death is real and immediate (pikuach nefesh) ‚Äì the only acts not permissible are blood shedding, forbidden relations, and idolatry. If the donor is living then he may not donate an organ where this will risk his death, even if this is to save the life of another. However, where there will be no appreciable detriment to his health, he may do so, and some even argue he is obligated. If the donor is dead, there is again, in principle, no obstacle to organ donation so long as it is for the purpose of pikuach nefesh, but the reality is that the donor must be dead, otherwise the removal of vital organs would constitute murder, and the issue is how death is defined. Traditionally Judaism defined death as the absence of a cardiac/respiratory beat, but with advances in modern medicine and the advent of the concept of brain or brain stem death, which may occur whilst the heart and lungs are maintained artificially in a viable state, disagreement has arisen as to when organs may be harvested. The traditional opinion is that it is only after the cessation of cardio- respiratory activity, which renders unviable the potential for transplant of many organs. However the above medical advances have led to much discussion and assessment of Jewish law so that today, whilst there continues to be opposition to transplantation before cardiac/respiratory death, there are several authorities which argue that it is allowed, and this is now the official position of the government of the State of Israel and its Chief Rabbinate. In any event, there is no agreed consensus, and it is always advised to consult with a rabbi before making a decision.  Determination of death  Another major debate around organ donation concerns with the definition of death. Because if the accepted definition if death is \\"incorrect,\\" removing a heart from a donor who was established dead under the \\"wrong\\" criteria is tantamount to murder.See for instance http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/635401/jewish/Organ- Donation.htm, checked Aug 2014 With life-support and cardiopulmonary resuscitative technology, establishing the moment of death becomes more complicated and opinionated. According to some, Jewish law defines death as a state of complete and irreversible cessation of cardiorespiratory function followed by a minimum of 5 minutes' waiting during which it is not restored (period of time depends on custom). After 5 minutes blood flow to organs have ceased, at which time it removal of organs to save a life is permitted according to some rabbinical opinions. Some opinions define death as solely the irreversible cessation of breathing, and some define death as the irreversible cessation of the heartbeat‚Äîwhich is the majority, long standing accepted opinion. In 1968, a Harvard committee decided on a set of criteria for irreversible coma, or brain stem death. Regarding the point at which a person is considered dead in the case of brain-stem death with a ventilator machine causing heartbeat, a definitive consensus from halachic authorities has not been reached as of today. However increasing numbers of orthodox authorities accept brain stem death with various stringencies, enabling surgeons to take full advantage of modern medical technology in transplantations of organs from the deceased.Website of the Halachic Organ Donor Society, checked Aug 2014: http://www.hods.org/English/h-issues/issues.asp#brainstem Israel, in particular, passed organ donation laws in 2008 with the full support of its Chief Rabbinate,Website of the Israel National Transplant Center: www.itc.gov.il, checked August 2014 and in other jurisdictions such organisations as the Halachic Organ Donor Society (HODS) encourage and support donation. Other considerations Apart from the problem of establishing death, there are additional problems in Jewish law that may arise in connection with organ donation. The Jewish religion attaches great importance to the dignity of the dead, and there are explicit laws as to the proper care to be given to the body, ensuring the respect of its dignity. However these pale beside the main issue of establishing death: * Mutilation of the dead ‚Äì The Torah prohibits the unnecessary mutilation of the dead. However, if the mutilation is done with the purpose of saving life, the principle of Pikuach Nefesh allows it. * Postponement of burial ‚Äì Although the Torah prohibits the postponement of burial, and organ harvesting may postpone it by a number of hours, if it is done with the purpose of saving life, the principle of Pikuach Nefesh allows it. * Benefiting from the dead ‚Äì The Torah prohibits benefiting from the dead. Although the recipient of the dead person's organs benefits, since this was done with the purpose of saving life, the principle of Pikuach Nefesh allows it. Terminally-ill donors Another issue of organ donation concerning the donor is the prohibition against touching a goses. A goses is a halachic category ascribed to people who are critically ill and expected to die within a brief period, typically three days. Jewish law forbids touching the body of a goses for fear that any sudden movement may accelerate the time of death. For this reason, there may be reluctance to medically intervene (preparing patient for organ donation) with an imminently dying patient solely for the purpose of preparing them for organ donation. Therefore, heart transplants raise a controversial question of when does one determine the patient donor dead to be able to begin the transplant procedure and remove the heart. Types of Organ Transplants and Jewish law=Artificial organs Transplants with artificial organs do not pose any problems in Jewish law (with the exception of artificial heart transplants), as long as the prospects for success are greater than the risks. Therefore, there is no conflict with Jewish law against artificial heart valves, bone parts, joints, and use of dialysis. Artificial heart transplants are not permissible according to Jewish law due to low success rates and the serious medical complications involved. Medical science has not reached the point of being able to use artificial organs or animal organs as protocol for transplantation. Blood and bone marrow According to Jewish law application, it is permissible to donate blood and bone marrow tissue because there is almost no danger or risk to the donor, and these tissues regenerate quickly. Heart For successful heart and liver transplants the donor's heart must still be beating. There is the important issue of determining the moment of death to permit heart transplantation. As stated, some rabbis prohibit removal of an organ from a brain-dead patient, making it impossible to perform heart transplants. Other rabbis accept the criterion for brain stem death and allow organ transplantation to immediately save a life. Kidney After kidney donation, the donor lives with one kidney and there is a small risk associated with the surgery. Whether a person is obligated to endanger his own life to any degree to save another person's life who is critically ill is a critical question in Jewish rulings. Therefore, there are some rabbinical opinions that prohibit kidney donation from live donors. Other rabbis allow it as an act of piety, and others believe it is an obligation not to violate a precept, \\"Thou shall not stand idly by the blood of thy fellow man.\\" Lungs The lobe of lung transplantation is not common from living donors because the morbidity and mortality risk to the donor is felt to be excessive. Non-living lung donations are more commonly used. Skin Many Rabbis who allow organ donation for life-saving organs extend this to allow preserving human skin from cadavers in skin banks for future use for burn victims. Ultra-Orthodox opposition Some Haredim are vehemently opposed to organ donations postmortem as it violated Jewish burial law, which considers postmortem organ removal as \\"desecrating a corpse.\\" Many Haredi rabbis also oppose the removal of organs when the person is classified as \\"brain-dead.\\" While there are some rabbis in the Haredi world that follow the religious leniency the Modern Orthodox community uses, most follow the more traditional interpretation. Haredim in Israel have recently issued an anti-organ-donor or \\"life\\" card which is intended to ensure that organs are not removed from the bearer after brain death or brain stem death. It states: \\"I do not give my permission to take from me, not in life or in death, any organ or part of my body for any purpose.\\"http://forward.com/news/306056/can-an-orthodox-charity-help-save- lives-in-this-mans-church/ However, Haredi Jews have a high rate of live organ donations. In 2014, 17% of all live kidney donations to strangers in the United States were donated by Haredi Jews, even though they are only 0.2% of the US population.http://forward.com/opinion/306290/renewal-only-gives- kidneys-to-jews-and-thats-okay/ Other studies of other live organ donations in the US and Israel show similarly high donation rates for a variety of organs. Many Haredi leaders point out that their community is very pro-organ donations, they are only opposed to it under certain circumstances.https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/10/2010/kidney_donation_in_jewish_law_a_testimony_to_the_progress_of_science_a/ See also *Religious views on organ donation *Organ transplantation in Israel Sources * International Rabbinic Fellowship.

Scott (AP-43) was a ship. She was built in 1921 and spent 20 years in merchant service as a passenger and cargo liner. She was acquired for the United States Navy shortly before the USA entered the Second World War, served as a troopship in Operation Torch in November 1942, and was sunk by a U-boat four days later. 59 crewmen and soldiers died during the sinking. Construction The vessel was designed to be a troopship, ordered by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) from Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Sparrows Point, Maryland, and laid down in 1920. Her intended name was to be Berrien, but when she was launched on 17 April 1921, it was as Hawkeye State, United States official number 220987. The ship, hull number 4180 and the first of a series, was an Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) Design 1029 and one of eight contracted ships of the design for Bethlehem Shipbuilding of which five were built after cancellations. The Design 1029 ships were first known, along with the slightly smaller Design 1095 or \\"502s\\" built only by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, as the \\"State\\" ships, as all were given state nicknames until all but four were renamed by May 1922 for United States presidents. In later commercial service they were frequently known as the \\"535s\\" for their length overall. Hawkeye State was a turbine steamship, with four steam turbines driving twin propeller shafts by single reduction gearing giving a service speed of . Civilian service On 5 March 1921 Hawkeye State, the largest combined passenger and cargo vessel of the USSB ever to put into a Pacific port, arrived in San Francisco to begin Matson Line service. Matson operated Hawkeye State between Baltimore and Honolulu via the Panama Canal and California. In 1922, she passed to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, which was taken over by Robert Dollar in 1925. She was then transferred to Dollar Steamship Company, which renamed her President Pierce. In 1938, Dollar was reorganised as American President Lines. Routes with Dollar Lines Dollar Line put President Pierce on trans-Pacific services between San Francisco and the Far East until 1931, when she was switched to a round-the-world service. Her first circumnavigation began at New York on 19 November 1931, going via the Panama Canal, California, Japan, China, Malaya, Ceylon, the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean and thence back to New York. She completed a total of five such trips, beginning her final one from New York on 2 June 1933. SS President Hoover Early on the morning of 11 December 1937, a much larger Dollar Lines ship, the ocean liner , ran aground in a typhoon on Kasho-to, east of Formosa. Hoovers 330 crew got their 503 passengers and themselves safely ashore without loss, but the 853 people now needed to be taken off the remote island. The task was shared between President Pierce and American Mail Line's SS President McKinley. McKinley, assisted by the , collected about 630 people from Kasho-to on 14 December. Pierce collected the remaining 200 people on 15 December. War service On 31 July 1941, President Pierce was delivered by American President Lines to the War Department at San Francisco for operation by the US Army, which renamed her USAT Hugh L. Scott after General Hugh L. Scott, who was Army Chief of Staff 1914‚Äì17 and interim Secretary of War February‚ÄîMarch 1916. The ship made one round trip to Honolulu before voyaging to Manila and redelivered to American President Lines for a special State Department mission to Hong Kong and Shanghai. In late October she returned to San Francisco by way of Manila to make one more round trip to Manila returning to San Francisco 25 December 1941. The ship made two trips to Australia in early 1942 and was then ordered to the US East Coast arriving at New York in July 1942. On 14 August 1942, she was transferred to the US Navy and converted into an attack transport by Tietjen and Long of Hoboken, New Jersey. On 7 September 1942, she was commissioned as USS Hugh L. Scott, under the command of Captain Harold J. Wright. Hugh L. Scott took part in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. As part of Transport Division 3 (TransDiv 3), she sailed on 24 October after intensive amphibious training. She approached the beaches at Fedhala, French Morocco, early on the morning of 8 November and landed her troops. She then cleared the immediate invasion area and did not return until 11 November, when she entered the refueling area and then anchored in the exposed Fedhala roadstead to unload her supplies.

Written around 1190 in rhyming couplets, it tells the story of a child born of the incestuous union of a brother and sister, who is brought up in a monastery, ignorant of his origins, marries his mother, repents of his sins and becomes pope. Plot Gregorius' parents are aged approximately 11 when he is born and are the orphaned children of a wealthy duke, and his father dies after being sent on a pilgrimage from Europe to Jerusalem to repent of their sins by a wise old man. The same wise old man tells Gregorius' mother to place the child in a box on a small boat and to push the boat out onto the ocean, where God will take care of the child. She dutifully does this, placing 20 pieces of gold in with him, alongside a tablet upon which the details of his sinful birth are recorded. The boat is discovered by two fishermen sent by an abbot to fish on the sea, and upon opening the box when they arrive back on shore, the abbot orders one of the fisherman to raise the child as his son. Aged six, Gregorius begins his education under the abbot's guidance, and as he grows, quickly becomes very clever, strong, and handsome, revealing to all that he cannot merely be the son of a poor fisherman. In late adolescence he discovers his adoptive family are not his own, and after much debate with the abbot leaves the monastery to pursue a life of chivalric duty as a knight in order to repent of his parents' sin which he discovers when the abbot reveals a tablet to him which relates the story of his birth. Through his knightly prowess wins the hand of the mistress of a besieged city. They marry, and one day as he is out hunting, a maid shows his wife to the room where he has kept the tablet, and from which he always emerges terribly sadly with eyes red from crying. With horror, his wife recognizes the tablet and discovers she is not only his wife, but also his mother and his aunt. Upon hearing of this, Gregorius exiles himself to go and live a humble life in poverty repenting for his sin. He tells his mother to distribute her wealth to the poor and to live a life of poverty as penance for her sins too. Gregorius asks to be put on a rock in the middle of a lake by a fisherman, who tosses the key to Gregorius' chains (which bind him to the rock) into the lake and tells Gregorius that, should the key ever be rediscovered, he will know that Gregorius is indeed a holy man and has been forgiven by God. Seventeen years later, God tells two elderly clergymen in Rome that the next pope is to be found repenting a grave sin upon a rock in Aquitania. They ride off to find him, and find the lake and the fisherman, who greedily sells them a meal instead of offering them a gift of sustenance. Upon gutting the fish however, he discovers the key to Gregorius' chains and is horrified to have chained a holy man to a rock, even more so because he presumes that after seventeen years, the man must surely be dead. He takes the two men to the rock, where they discover the emaciated Gregorius, who has survived thanks to the Holy Spirit and a trickle of water emerging from the rock. The fisherman throws himself to his knees and laments of his sin, terrified that he is now too old to still have time to properly repent. However, the narration tells us that his grief is so sincere that his soul is saved. He unlocks Gregorius, who goes off with the two men to become pope. Once in office, he meets his mother, who has done exactly what she was bidden to do by him and led a life of extreme poverty. She does not recognize him, but he tells her who he is, and that they have been forgiven by God, in accordance with the proper repentance they have fulfilled. Arthurian romance style Gregorius possesses the hallmarks of an Arthurian romance, the story appearing to reach a climax when he lifts the siege upon his mother's land and marries her, this quickly becoming a crisis when they realise the truth of the situation, and then there is a strong anti-climax at the end of which the lowest point of the narrative is reached (at which point Gregorius is chained to the rock). The narrative then reaches another climax, this time the real one and the poem's conclusion, when Gregorius becomes pope and both he and mother are reconciled. Manuscripts Gregorius is preserved in five complete manuscripts and six fragments. It is largely based upon older French manuscripts, although Hartmann has made some significant alterations.

Tucker Thompson changed her design to build her in steel and extended her by more than two metres, making the hull longer and deeper to accommodate the tall rigging. Her design is based on a halibut schooner and a replica of vessels that plied their trade on the Pacific West Coast of the USA in the early 19th century. The schooner was constructed with a welded steel hull and decking, with topsides and deck overlay made from kwila. As built, the vessel is in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of .Clarke & Iggulden, Sailing Home, p. 4 The rigging arrangement is described as a gaff-rigged square-topsail schooner with three- quarter course. The ship's mast height is , and she has a sail area of . Auxiliary propulsion is provided by a Ford diesel engine, capable of driving R. Tucker Thompson at . Building R. Tucker Thompson was started by Robert Tucker Thompson and his son Tod. Tucker Thompson was born in California and always called Tucker. He and his family emigrated to New Zealand in January 1971. After a few years he moved to Whangarei Heads. In 1977, he started work on the ship with his son, Tod. Tucker became ill in 1978, and died later that year at the age of 49. By this point, the plating was almost complete, but the hull lay there for some years before Tod decided to work on it again. In a chance meeting, while working in Whangarei on the Bounty replica, Tod met Russell Harris and the pair went into partnership to complete the ship. Work resumed in 1982, when the hull was moved to Mangawhai Heads. Limited funds meant that things had to be recycled. The massive fisherman‚Äôs anchor was found when a pub was being auctioned in Auckland and is stamped with the seal of approval of Lloyds Proving house in Chatham. The anchor windlass was modified from the back of a bulldozer; the bits were made from railway sleepers. The belaying pin and handsome wheel were made from old puriri fence posts. Spars were scarfed and laminated of Douglas Fir taken from an old Auckland building demolished to make way for the Regent Hotel. The varnished cap rail was made from demolition kauri. Skylights came from the yacht Askoy. She was launched on Mangawhai Beach on 12 October 1985.Clarke & Iggulden, Sailing Home, p. vii Karewa, a Maori figurine to be her guardian, was carved by Gordon Hatfield and presented by William MacDonald Taylor, both of Ngapuhi. History Shortly after launching, the ship was chartered for the filming of The Adventurer in the Bay of Islands. In late 1986, R. Tucker Thompson sailed to England via the South Pacific and the Panama Canal to join the First Fleet Re-enactment Voyage: a historical re-enactment for the Australian Bicentenary. She left England for Australia in May 1987, and sailed with the fleet via Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Mauritius, and Fremantle before arriving in Sydney on Australia Day (26 January) 1988.King, The First Fleet. p. 89-90 Russell Harris purchased Tod Thompson's shares in 1993. The ship was then marketed and operated by Fullers Bay of Islands, providing day sails in the Bay of Islands. In the winter, the ship provided a limited quantity of sail training voyages for young people deemed to be ‚Äúat risk‚Äù. In 1995, the vessel participated in the Nuclear Free Pacific protest flotilla. In 2002, the ship was involved in the Sail Korea 2002 international regatta, and participated in the American Sail Training Association (ASTA) West Coast Tall Ships Challenge. In 2003, Fullers decided to build their own sailing vessel and terminated the arrangement with R. Tucker Thompson, which continued to operate directly. A second West Coast Challenge was participated in during 2005. The forward deck from the rigging On 4 June 2006, Russell Harris gifted R. Tucker Thompson to the people of Te Tai Tokerau Northland. In a symbolic event, the ship was sailed by Russell, his children and grandchildren from Opua to Russell Kororareka. Schoolchildren from the schools in the Bay of Islands and the community, boarded the ship to sail the ship themselves back into the port of Opua as a new entity. The ship is now operated as a not-for-profit trust with a mission of ‚ÄúLearning for Life through the Sea‚Äù. Focus is on education experiences for all ages. Day sails continue during summer providing adults the opportunity to experience tall ship sailing and these have been supplemented with additional youth trips and history trips. R. Tucker Thompson could not participate in the ASTA West Coast Challenge in 2008, as July 2008 was her maintenance month. Film work The ship has been used in films and documentaries including \\"The Adventurer\\" series by TVNZ; \\"Red\\", a Somerset Maugham story by Infa Film Germany; Rite of Passage for the Australian First Fleet Re-enactment Company; Life of Mammals by the BBC; Captain's Log, a TVNZ documentary charting Captain Cook's circumnavigation of New Zealand; BBC Scotland's documentary on the life of James Morrison; Survivor: Cook Islands for Survivor Entertainment Group and Leo Houlding's \\"On the Edge\\" for Ginger TV.

It includes the essay in which he coined the term \\"the 'Me' Decade\\" to refer to the 1970s. In addition to the stories, Wolfe also illustrated the book.  Publication  Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine was Wolfe's third collection of essays and short stories, following The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine- Flake Streamline Baby in 1965 and The Pump House Gang in 1968. Wolfe's 1970 book Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers contained two lengthy essays and is not generally considered a collection. Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine was published in 1976 by Wolfe's regular publisher Farrar, Straus & Giroux.  Themes  The subjects of Wolfe's essays were considered less original than his previous efforts. When Wolfe wrote about the culture of surf gangs in The Pump House Gang or about stock car racing in The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby it was untrod ground. In Mauve Gloves, Wolfe wrote about subjects that had been widely covered before and sought to bring his unique insight to old stories, rather than tell wholly original stories about unexplored subcultures. The primary theme of Wolfe's essays is the struggle for social status. Wolfe is particularly critical of the intelligentsia and the liberal elite, themes that he had previously explored in Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers. His contempt for distinguished writers (which would later be manifested in a feud with many of his contemporaries, particularly John Updike) was evident in an essay about an established West Side author discussing his cash flow at length. Wolfe continued to denounce what he saw as faux-sympathy for poor people coming from a rich liberal elite. Wolfe terms the status-driven era he chronicled the Me' Decade,\\" and suggests that the wealth of the Post-War era is responsible for the self-absorption of the 1970s. Wolfe declared that people had given up on \\"man's age-old belief in serial immortality,\\" the notion that people lived on through ancestral tradition and self-sacrifice, and instead focused only on themselves. The longest essay, however, is \\"The Truest Sport: Jousting with Sam and Charlie,\\" about life aboard an aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1967. Wolfe writes about the personnel of the aircraft in heroic terms. According to The New York Review of Books, another common theme throughout all the books is the effect the Vietnam War had on American society. The lone short story in the book, \\"The Commercial\\" is an essay of a black baseball player who is given an advertising deal. Initially, the athlete believes the commercial will help establish him as more than a black athlete, but instead the advertisers want him to mispronounce words, thus dehumanizing him despite his success.  Writing  Often referred to as New Journalism, Wolfe's characteristic writing style, characterized by florid prose and obsessive attention to detail, are on display throughout the book. Wolfe compared himself to British author Evelyn Waugh, who was known for his dark comedy. The New York Times however, suggested that Wolfe's latest effort most closely resembled the French author Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, who in the early 20th century, wrote in a highly colloquial style, and delved deeply into the anxieties of his characters. Because Wolfe's subjects in Mauve Gloves were not people on the fringes of society, the New York Times critic argued that Wolfe had begun to rely more heavily on \\"writing qua writing,\\" and less on the inherent zaniness of his subjects. In one of the book's most famous passages in the essay \\"The 'Me' Decade and the Third Great Awakening\\", exemplifying his style of description, Wolfe called Jimmy Carter a \\"Missionary lectern-pounding Amen ten-finger C-major-chord Sister-Martha-at-the-Yamaha-keyboard loblolly piney-woods Baptist.\\" Contents The 12 pieces in the book are divided into four sections as follows: ;\\"Stories and Sketches\\" 1. \\"Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine\\" 2. \\"The Man Who Always Peaked Too Soon\\" 3. \\"The Truest Sport: Jousting with Sam and Charlie\\" 4. \\"The Commercial:A Short Story\\" ;\\"The Spirit of the Age (and what it longs for)\\" 5. \\"The Intelligent Coed's Guide to America\\" 6. \\"The 'Me' Decade and the Third Great Awakening\\" ;\\"Sex and Violence\\" 7. \\"The Perfect Crime\\" 8. \\"Pornoviolence\\" 9. \\"The Boiler Room and the Computer\\" ;\\"Manners, Decor, and Decorum\\" 10. \\"Funky Chic\\" 11. \\"Honks and Wonks\\" 12. \\"The Street Fighters\\" References Category:1976 books Category:Essay collections by Tom Wolfe Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books ","title":"Mauve Gloves &amp; Madmen, Clutter &amp; Vine"},{"id":"12687254","text":"High Cliff State Park is a Wisconsin state park near Sherwood, Wisconsin.

Perched above the Shawangunk Kill, it enjoys a splendid view of the nearby Shawangunk Ridge. Built between 1752‚Äì55, it is the oldest building in continuous use among American congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church.< It is on the National Register of Historic Places, and has played a role in the development of the larger Reformed Church in the U.S. through some church leaders who began their careers there. History There has been a congregation in the area since 1736, when five baptisms were recorded. The Dutch, German and Huguenot settlers of the region went to Kingston to handle their religious affairs, but eventually the local population grew large enough that they desired a church closer to home. So, in 1751, Isaac Hasbrouck bought six acres (2.4 ha) on which to build a church. After the current parsonage across the road was built, construction began on the church itself the following year when subscribers put up the money in return for pews. Legend has it the workers had to first put up wooden stockades to fend off hostile Indian attacks. The adjacent Bruynswick Rural Cemetery, no longer owned by the congregation, saw its first burials that year, and the congregation was formally organized in 1753, with the Rev. Barent Vrooman serving as the first pastor. He left after a year to be replaced by Johannes Goetschius in 1760. On December 26, 1755, the pews were sold and the completed church formally opened. Goetschius served until his death in 1771 and was buried in the church, beneath what was then the pulpit. The building underwent its first serious renovations in the late 1790s, when the interior was rotated. The west windows became the doors and the pulpit was moved to the east wall, followed by a corresponding change in the orientation of the pews, and the parsonage's second story completed. In 1833-34 the five front columns were added, in the then-popular Greek Revival style, to protect the doors. The original south entrance was finally sealed in 1881. A third building, a church hall to the west, was added to the church complex in 1916. It received a wing for modern kitchen and bathroom functions in 1958, and another one to meet space needs in 1990. In 1982 the building was listed on the National Register as \\"Reformed Church of Shawangunk Complex\\", reflecting the historic importance of all the buildings and the cemetery. Legacy Five other local Dutch Reformed Church congregations have been split off from the Shawangunk Reformed Church: New Hurley, New Prospect, Guilford, Wallkill and Gardiner. The New Hurley church is also on the National Register. Two former pastors of the church have become President of the Reformed Church in America: Ryniew Van Nest in the late 18th century and Charles Scott a century later. Scott left Shawangunk to accept a professorship at Hope College in Holland, Michigan; he would eventually serve as church president from 1881-92. He is buried in the church's cemetery. John Van Vleck, a former congregant who became a minister himself, helped establish Hope's forerunner, Holland Academy. Van Vleck Hall on campus is named for him. Abraham Wilson, another former pastor, left to fill the same position for the Reformed Church in Fairfield, Illinois, the church's first congregation in what was then known as the West, in 1837. At least 143 men from the congregation fought in the Revolutionary War. Of those, 43 are buried in the cemetery.

Cole's 1st Potomac Home Brigade Maryland Cavalry on January 10, 1864, in Loudoun County, Virginia. Cole's Cavalry successfully defended a night raid against their camp on Loudoun Heights. The fight was one of the first engagements in which Union forces held their own against Mosby's vaunted partisans. Background On January 1, 1864, eighty members of Cole's Maryland Cavalry, led by Captain A. M. Hunter, entered the region colloquially known as \\"Mosby's Confederacy\\" around Upperville and Rectortown, Virginia. With Mosby off on a scout in Fairfax, Capt. William \\"Billy\\" Smith rounded up 32 Rangers and set off in pursuit of the Federals. The Rangers caught up with Hunter's force near Middleburg. Captain Hunter quickly deployed his men into battle line just as Smith ordered a charge. The Federal line soon crumbled when Hunter's horse was killed, tumbling the captain to the ground. The Union cavalry hastily retreated towards Middleburg, but not before losing 57 killed, wounded or captured, as well as 60 horses seized by the Rangers. Within a week, Cole's camp atop Loudoun Heights had been discovered, thanks to the work of Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow, a staff officer under J.E.B. Stuart temporarily attached to Mosby's command. Angered by the audacity of Cole's Cavalry to raid so deep into Mosby's territory and encouraged by the enemy's woeful performance at Middleburg, Mosby decided to attack Cole's main force, hoping to catch them unaware in their camp. The battle On January 9, Mosby ordered a rendezvous at Upperville, to which 100 Rangers responded. The partisan company set out for Loudoun Heights through deep snow and bitter cold, reaching Woodgrove around 8 p.m. and stopping for 2 hours at the home of Ranger Henry Heaton. Just north of Hillsboro, they met up with Stringfellow and his scouting party, who informed Mosby of the exact location and strength of Cole's camp. Spotting Federal pickets posted along the Hillsboro-Harpers Ferry Road, the Confederates turned and headed east toward the wooded western slope of Short Hill Mountain, which they followed until they came to the bank of the Potomac River. From there, they turned westward and made their way along the riverbank to the base of Loudoun Heights. As the Rangers made their way up mountain, they were forced to dismount, given the steep grade. They stopped once they were within of the Union camp. Mosby sent a detachment of men under Stringfellow to capture Cole's headquarters in the rear of the camp, while he took the rest of the men further up the hillside, until they were directly west of the camp. At around 3 a.m., as Mosby prepared to order the attack, gunfire erupted from the direction of Stringfellow's position, followed by the distant appearance of horsemen riding towards Mosby from the direction of the enemy camp. Thinking the unknown party was Federals who had discovered Stringfellow and his men, Mosby ordered a charge. His Rangers descended upon the camp and attacked the horsemen, who turned out to be Stringfellow's squadron. It was several minutes before the two parties recognized each other in the darkness, but not before several Confederates had been hit by friendly fire. In the meantime, Cole's men were awakened by the gunfire. Led by Captain George W.F. Vernon, of Company A, the men grabbed their weapons and hastily formed a dismounted battle line, though many were barely dressed. Despite the darkness, the Federals easily identified the Rangers, who stood out as they were the only ones on horses. Their initial volley dropped several Confederates, many of whom were caught out in the open along the road. In the confusion of the 45 minute fight that followed, several Rangers retreated and, soon afterward, with the sound of Federal infantry approaching from Harpers Ferry, Mosby ordered a general withdrawal. The Rangers escaped with 6 prisoners (pickets from Co. B of Cole's Cavalry, all taken from their post along the Hillsboro road at the crossing of Piney Run) and nearly 60 horses, but were forced to leave their dead and seriously wounded behind. A few miles beyond the Union camp, Mosby halted and sent two Rangers back under a flag of truce to exchange the prisoners for their dead and wounded, which included Billy Smith and First Lieutenant Thomas Turner. Major Cole, however, declined the offer, and the Rangers left and made their way back towards Mosby's Confederacy. Aftermath Mosby's Rangers suffered 14 casualties--4 dead, 4 mortally wounded, 5 wounded and 1 captured. Among the wounded was William \\"Willie\\" Mosby, John's brother. Of the dead, it was believed that 3 were victims of friendly fire. Cole suffered 6 dead, 14 wounded, and 6 captured. For their performance in the fight, the first in which Federals had bested Mosby's Rangers, Cole was promoted from major to colonel and Vernon from captain to lieutenant colonel.

It is the Asia's largest open trade fair. This festival is held in Odisha (a state in eastern India), in the city of Cuttack at Gadagadia Ghata of the Mahanadi river, to mark the day when ancient Sadhabas (Odia mariners) would set sail to distant lands of Bali, as well as Java (at the time of the voyage known as \\"Yawadvipa\\"), Sumatra, Borneo (all in Indonesia), and Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) for trade and cultural expansion. To commemorate this, the festival is celebrated every year from the day of Kartika Purnima (full moon day of the month of Kartika) according to the Odia Calendar. On Kartika Purnima, which comes around the end of October and November, people of Odisha gather near banks of Mahanadi, Brahmani river, other river banks, ponds, water tanks and sea shores to float miniature toy boats, made of colored paper, dried banana tree barks, and cork, as a symbolic gesture of their ancestors' voyage. These toy boats, usually launched early in the morning contain traditional paan and small oil lamps, which are lit and placed inside them, to provide an attractive sight during the festival. People sing a song Aa ka ma boi, pan gua thoi... to remember the early maritime history of Odisha. The song tells about four months that are important for marine merchants of Kalinga (the earlier name of Odisha). This festival is also celebrated with great fanfare in Paradeep. Bali Jatra bears testimony to the rich maritime legacy of ancient Odisha. This is the specific time that was considered auspicious by the Sadhabas to begin their voyage in vessels called Boitas. The voyage is begun on Kartika Purnima to take advantage of the favorable wind blowing during this time. Ajhala or big fabric sails were used to harness the wind power to move the Boitas. Bali Jatra is also associated with Taapoi and rituals like Bhalukuni Osha or Khudurukuni Osha and Bada Osha. Taapoi is closely associated with the Bali Jatra festival, which recalls traditional memories of young maidens waiting for the return of their sailor brothers. In Cuttack, Bali Jatra is celebrated annually as a large open fair near the Barabati Fort area. It is said to be the largest fair of Asia. There are several attractions for children like toy stalls, giant wheels, different games, maut ka kuan (literally well of death) and food stalls selling Odia delicacies (Cuttack Dahibara Aludum, Thunka puri, Kulfi, Gupchup, Mathura Cake, Banarasi Paana etc.) from different parts of the state, and other vendors selling toys, curiosities, and other gifts. Bali Jatra also provides a lot of cultural programs. Every year millions of people from all over the nation come to experience it.

She was the only female participant in the Precisionist movement, which in the 1920s and 1930s took a Cubist- inspired approach to painting the skyscrapers and factories that had come to define the new American landscape. Her works are in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Houston Museum of the Fine Arts, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the James A. Michener Art Museum in Pennsylvania, and the Columbus Museum of Art, among others. She was married to the American abstract artist Lee Gatch. Career Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Driggs grew up in New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City, in a family that was supportive of her artistic interests. After a summer spent painting with her sister in New Mexico in her late teens, she felt she had found her life's calling. At twenty, she enrolled in classes at the Art Students League of New York, where she studied under George Luks and Maurice Sterne, both of whom were charismatic, inspirational figures in her early life. She also attended the evening criticism classes held at the home of painter John Sloan. Driggs spent fourteen months in Europe from late 1922 to early 1924, drawing and studying Italian art. There she met Leo Stein, first in Paris and later in Florence, who became an important intellectual influence, and who urged her to study C√©zanne. He also introduced her to the works of Piero della Francesca, the Renaissance artist for whom she felt throughout her life the greatest admiration.Biographical information for this entry is taken from Constance Kimmerle, Elsie Driggs: The Quick and the Classical (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008), pp. 13-55 and John Loughery, \\"Blending the Classical and the Modern: The Art of Elsie Driggs,\\" Woman's Art Journal (Winter 1987), pp. 22-26. Driggs eventually settled in New York City, where she found representation with the progressive Charles Daniel Gallery. (Advised that the old-fashioned and misogynistic Daniel would be unlikely to take on a woman artist, she signed the works she left for his consideration simply \\"Driggs\\" and waited to meet him in person until he had expressed his eagerness to include her in his gallery.)Loughery, p. 22. In sympathy with those artists Daniel represented who were part of the burgeoning Precisionist movement, such as Charles Demuth, Charles Sheeler, George Ault, Niles Spencer, and Preston Dickinson, she too painted \\"the modern landscape of factories, bridges, and skyscrapers with geometric precision and almost abstract spareness.\\"michenermuseum.org Impressionism and academic or Ashcan realism represented the past, in Driggs' view, and she intended to be resolutely modern. She was an attractive and engaging woman, but her demeanor belied a strong ambition and a clear sense of what it would take to make her mark in the New York art world. However, Driggs was part of the pre-eminent first group of Precisionist painters, including Demuth and Sheeler, who exhibited at the Daniel Gallery in the 1920s. A later group of Precisionist painters, including Louis Lozowick, Ralston Crawford and others, came on the American Art scene during the 1930s. Driggs, herself, felt that the style came to an end with the 1929 stock market crash.Driggs had come from a well to do family who resided on Central Park West, but because of the stock market crash, the Driggs family lost much of their affluence. As related by Driggs, herself, to art historian Thomas Folk, in several interviews he conducted with her circa 1985-1990, she felt that the Precisionist style had gone out of vogue with the Great Depression. At least it apparently did for her. In 1926 she painted her most famous work, Pittsburgh, a dark and brooding picture now in the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, which depicts the gargantuan smokestacks of the Jones & Laughlin steel mills in Pittsburgh. Its focus is an overpowering mass of black and gray smokestacks, thick piping, and crisscrossing wires with only clouds of smoke to relieve the severity of the image, yet it was an image in which she found an ironic beauty. She called the picture \\"my El Greco\\" and expressed surprise that viewers in later years interpreted the painting as a work of social criticism.On the circumstances surrounding the painting of this work: Loughery, p. 24. Like the other Precisionists (e.g., Demuth, Charles Sheeler, Louis Lozowick, Stefan Hirsch), she was concerned with applying modernist techniques to renderings of the new industrial and urban landscape, not in commenting on potential dangers the overly mechanized modern world of 1920s America might present. If anything, Precisionism, like Futurism, was a celebration of man-made energy and technology. One year later, she painted Blast Furnaces, in a similar vein. As noted above, Piero della Francesca's mural depicting \\"The Story of the True Cross\\" in Arezzo, with its tubular, static and frozen forms was the major influence on Driggs' \\"Pittsburgh\\" (it may have been the major influence for \\"Blast Furnaces\\" as well).Thomas Folk, \\"Remembering Elsie\\" in Kimmerle, \\"Elsie Driggs,\\" p.129. In the late 1970s, Driggs wrote an essay, \\"The Search for Pierro della Francesca\\" for a writing class at New York University. This essay was first published in Thomas Folk, \\"Elsie Driggs:A Woman of Genius,\\" New Jersey State Museum, 1991, p. 51-52; and later also appeared in Kimmerle, \\"Driggs,\\" p. 143-145. After Pittsburgh, Driggs' most acclaimed work was probably Queensborough Bridge (1927), now in the collection of the Montclair Art Museum, depicting shafts of light as rigid Futurist-style \\"lines of force\\" sweeping through the massive verticals of the East River bridge, a structure she had studied from her apartment window on Second Avenue. With this painting, art critic Forbes Watson wrote, 'Miss Driggs waves goodbye to her old master Maurice Sterne and embraces for the moment the age of machinery.\\"Forbes Watson New York World, April 23, 1927. However, Driggs' use of \\"ray lines\\" (slender black lines that criss-cross the canvas, recall Precisionist works by Charles Demuth, and particularly his \\"My Egypt\\" (also from 1927).Thomas Folk, Elsie Driggs, p.18. Although Driggs and Demuth exhibited at the Daniel Gallery, they never met. In 1929 Charles Daniel gave Driggs a one-woman show, which included one of her sleekest and most compelling paintings, Aeroplane, now in the collection of the Houston Museum of the Fine Arts. The inspiration for the painting came from Driggs' first experience flying in 1928, when she traveled from Cleveland to Detroit by air.Gail Stavitsky, Precisionism in America, 1915-1941: Reordering Reality (New York: Abrams, 1994), p. 111. (\\"Elsie Driggs, following the spirit of the age, has gone up in the air,\\" commented an Art News reviewer.Art News, Vol. 28, no. 9, November 30, 1929. Actually, Driggs went to Detroit to make studies from the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge Plant (Sheeler had preceded her there by a year). It was on this trip that she had made studies of a plane and sat next to the pilot on a shuttle trip from Cleveland to Detroit. This trip resulted in two Precisionist works, \\"Aeroplane\\" and \\"River Rouge.\\" Unfortunately, Driggs' \\"River Rouge,\\" a major Precisionist work, was lost in a fire.Thomas Folk,\\"Elsie Driggs, p. 18. Of course, River Rouge became Sheeler's best-known theme. However Sheeler would later create his version of a plane, \\"Yankee Clipper\\", in 1939 (collection of the Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, Rhode Island). At the same time that Driggs exhibited her Precisionist machine age works at the Daniel Gallery, she was also creating a series of important plant forms, both in pastel and oil, for the same gallery. In a group exhibition at the Daniel Gallery in 1924, \\"Chou\\" (collection of the Montclair Museum) a study of a cabbage, which was larger than life-sized, was displayed with works by Preston Dickenson, Andrew Dasburg and Thomas Hart Benton. The painting earned Driggs rave reviews by such prominent critics as Forbes Watson, who wrote,\\" Elsie Driggs, a newcomer, is a distinct addition to the gallery's group, her painting of the spread out leaves of a cabbage being one of the most sensitive pieces of painting in the entire exhibition.\\"Forbes Watson, \\"Painters form a Lively Group,\\" New York World, February 17, 1924. Perhaps Driggs' finest plant form is \\"Cabbage\\" of 1927 (private collection), which depicts an uprooted American cabbage swirling in space. This work is slightly larger and more dynamic than \\"Chou.\\" Here Driggs shows more interest in depicting the crinkly cabbage leaves with botanical accuracy. The abstract, brown and white shaded background recalls contemporaneous paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe, who Driggs was known to meet at least on one occasion.Folk, Driggs,p. 14. Driggs also exhibited in group exhibitions at the Whitney Club, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Chicago Art Institute and in the Whitney Museum's first Biennial. Important newspaper critics such as Henry McBride and Margaret Breuning wrote favorably about her work. In 1929 McBride commented, \\"Elsie Driggs is capable of interesting us in anything in which she herself is interested.\\"Henry McBride, New York Sun, November 30, 1929. When the Daniel gallery closed during the Depression, she was represented by the dealer J.B. Neumann and later by Frank Rehn. In the 1930s, Driggs, after executing five major Precisionist works, abandoned the style - a decision that she may have later regretted. In fact, she concentrated more on \\"whimsical watercolors and figurative paintings as well as murals for the PWPA.\\" In 1935, Driggs married painter Lee Gatch. After two winters in New York, the couple moved to rural Lambertville, New Jersey. Driggs dedicated her efforts to Gatch's erratic career and to raising their daughter Merriman.Elsie Driggs, James A. Michener Art Museum It was a loving but tumultuous marriage and their styles began to directly influence each other. Serendipitously, in 1940, their only child, Merriman, was playing with watercolors and began to rip paper and to paint the pieces. From this, Elsie got the idea of creating watercolor collages, which became a major focus of her work. She then began to create canvas collages, in which she would attach cutout pieces of canvas to a canvas, and then paint over them with oil paint. This idea was picked up by Lee, who began to incorporate the same process in both his paintings and his frames. These were adventurous works, which merit reconsideration.Thomas Folk, \\"Remembering Elsie\\" in Kimmerle, \\"Elsie Driggs,\\" p.130. After Gatch's death in 1968, Driggs returned to New York City. Over the next two decades, she experimented with mixed media constructions and figurative paintings in pastels and oils. The rise of feminist art history brought her renewed attention, and she was the subject of a one-woman show at the Martin Diamond Gallery in 1980 and a retrospective at the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton in 1990. Curated by Thomas Folk, the retrospective exhibition, titled \\"Elsie Driggs, A Woman of Genius,\\" traveled to the Phillips Collection in Washington DC. And Driggs created two final oil paintings in her Precissionist style, \\"The Javits Center\\" in 1986 (private collection) and \\"Hoboken\\" of the same year (private collection). She was included in many historical surveys of Precisionism.Kimmerle's book provides a complete list of all the exhibitions that included Driggs' work: Appendix, 2, pp. 134-142. She continued to follow the contemporary art scene, admiring in particular the work of Helen Frankenthaler and Francis Bacon.Loughery, pp. 25-26. She also sided with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe during his controversy at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington DC.Folk, \\"Remembering Elsie\\" in Kimmerle, \\"Driggs,\\" p. 131. At the time of her death in 1992 at the age of ninety-four, Driggs was considered the most underrated as well as the most long-lived of the Precisionist painters. Thomas Folk, organized a memorial service and symposium which was held at the Whitney Museum of American Art on August 25, 2002. \\"Pittsburgh\\" was proudly displayed on the rear wall of the auditorium.

To apply, a piggy-back clause must be included in a corporation's shareholder agreement, which is part of the incorporation materials. Because the shareholder's agreement is a contract, the rules are rather soft, and a piggyback clause can be tailored to fit the specific needs of the company. Generally, a piggyback clause applies only to a majority shareholder or someone with a large portion of the shares. The clause will come into effect when that person decides to sell all or a significant part (the percentage can be decided upon in the convention) of their shares to a third party (who may or may not be a shareholder). Should this person, or group of people, decide to sell their shares, the other shareholders can 'piggy-back' into the original shareholders offer to the third party, and offer to sell their shares to the third party for the same agreed upon price. The third party can then only buy the shares of the majority shareholder if he agrees to purchase all the shares of all other shareholders who wish to be bought out. In practice, however, if the majority shareholder decides to disregard the piggy-back clause, the other shareholders cannot (depending on different provinces or states) cancel the transaction, but have a recourse in damages against the seller.2010 √âcole du barreau There are two modalities of a piggy-back clause which can be observed in distinct situations.

Piggy-back (law-government contracts)  Piggy-back or piggybacking also applies to contracts issued by individual governmental entities that allow other jurisdictions to use the contract (i.e., to ‚Äúpiggyback‚Äù on the contract terms and prices) they established. The contracting jurisdiction must include piggyback language in the contract, and the vendor must agree. Piggyback contracts represent the most immediate cooperative purchasing resource, especially for smaller communities. However, they can be a benefit for larger communities by saving administrative costs and by creating pressure for lower prices.

It was directed by Joshua Michael Stern, and stars Kevin Costner, Paula Patton, Kelsey Grammer, Dennis Hopper, Nathan Lane, Stanley Tucci, George Lopez and Madeline Carroll. The film was released on August 1, 2008.\\"Six Actors Join Kevin Costner on His Swing Vote\\". Movieweb.com Plot In a presidential election set in an alternate 2008, Bud Johnson (Kevin Costner) is a man from Texico, New Mexico, who is coasting through life and has not had a single political thought in his head, while being coaxed by his twelve-year-old daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) to take more of a serious approach to life. Molly runs the household and sees an opportunity on election day to energize her father: frustrated with her father's apathy toward voting, she sneaks into her local polling place and tries to vote on behalf of Bud. However, due to the voting machines being unplugged, the ballot is registered, but no decision is indicated on which candidate gets the vote. The entire election now comes down to this one man's vote. Neither candidate has a majority in the electoral college without New Mexico's electoral votes. The popular vote is tied for the two major candidates in New Mexico, leaving Bud to decide the next President of the United States. Bud gets wooed by candidates from both sides: the incumbent Republican, Andrew Carington Boone (Kelsey Grammer), and his campaign manager, Martin Fox (Stanley Tucci); and the opposing Democrat, Vermont Senator Donald Greenleaf (Dennis Hopper) and his campaign manager Art Crumb (Nathan Lane). Bud's actual opinions (or lack thereof) are misinterpreted by the media, causing the candidates to flip-flop on several positions (the Democrats take a pro-life and anti-illegal immigration stand, while the Republicans take a pro- environmental and pro-gay marriage stand). As the film progresses, however, the two candidates are shown to move away from the cynical tactics forced on them by their advisers, and both gain Bud's respect. In the end, he chooses to hold a final debate the day before he is set to recast his ballot. In a written speech, he confesses that he knows little to nothing about politics, or for that matter, life, and decides to ask questions people have sent to him in the mail. The film ends with Bud casting his vote, though for whom he voted is never revealed.

Curepipe Botanic Gardens (or SSR Botanical Garden of Curepipe) in Route des Jardins, Curepipe, is the second largest botanical garden in Mauritius. It has a relatively informal layout, and contains a river, lake and the world's rarest palm tree among other attractions. History and composition A section of the gardens' lake. The gardens were established in 1870, with the initial goal of cultivating several varieties of plants that could not get acclimatized in the less temperate regions of the island (While still hot and tropical, Curepipe's climate is marginally cooler than that of the coastal territories of Mauritius). The gardens were initially furnished with a rich collection of exotic plants which have been introduced to Mauritius as ornamentals, especially Rhododendrons, Camphors and a range of exotic fruit trees. Azaleas, on the coat of arms of Curepipe, also grace the garden. However it now also boasts a small but growing collection of the rarest and most endangered endemic plants of Mauritius. In the mid 1980s, the garden was named \\"Sir Seewoosagar Botanical Garden\\" after Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Mauritius's first post-independence Prime Minister. A similarly-named botanical garden to the north in Pamplemousses (Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden), is also named after the same statesman. However the Curepipe Gardens are significantly smaller and cooler in temperature, with a more informal layout. Layout The gazebo, located on the gardens' front lawn, is occasionally used for events. Entrance to the garden is free. It covers an area of roughly 27 acres, and is situated about 2 km to the west of the Curepipe town centre in Route des Jardins. The main entrance is on Botanical Garden Street at Les Casernes, and a secondary entrance is located at Camp-Caval. The gardens are intersected by a river and a lake ‚Äì set about with Nandia palms. There is also a gazebo, at which community events are sometimes hosted. This Victorian-style kiosk has a raised wooden board floor, designed specifically for acoustics to cater for the audiences which attended the early concerts. The offices of the Forestry Department, from which permission is needed to visit the Nature Reserves of the interior, is located next door to the gardens. In partnership with the Curepipe Municipal Council, it has worked at propagating some of the island nation's rarest native trees and shrubs. Some have been planted in the gardens, including a variety of indigenous \\"Vacoas\\" (Pandanus) species which have been established around the lake. The world's rarest palm Hyophorbe amaricaulis, the rarest palm in the world. The only individual in existence is the specimen in Curepipe gardens. Curepipe Gardens house the rarest palm tree in the world, the unique specimen of Hyophorbe amaricaulis. This individual remains the only specimen of its species, as all of the many attempts to cross-fertilise it have failed. The unique palm is now surrounded by security fencing for its protection. It is about 12 meters high, with a thin gray trunk and occasional creamy white flowers.

Early years Herrera grew up in the Colombian town of Palmira, in the Valle del Cauca Department. While in high school, Herrera studied technical maintenance, experience that got him a job later in the United States. Living in the United States, he also became a jeweler and precious metals broker until he began selling cocaine in New York City. In 1975, and 1978, Herrera was arrested on distribution charges in New York City for selling cocaine. Cali Cartel In 1983, Herrera went to Cali, Colombia to negotiate supply and distribution rights with the Cali Cartel for New York City. He would later open up trafficking routes for the Cali Cartel through Mexico, with connections he had previously established. Herrera also ran one of the \\"most sophisticated and profitable money laundering operations\\", according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. Herrera was soon promoted to Cali cartel kingpin and given control over Jamund√≠ in the south of the Valle, and Palmira and Yumbo in the north and east of the Valle. The Herrera operation, according to the DEA, involved importing cocaine base from Peru and Bolivia, which would be trafficked via his own transportation to conversion laboratories in Colombia. It is believed Herrera hired guerrilla forces such as Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia () (FARC) and then guerrilla group 19th of April Movement (, M-19), to guard remote lab sites. Herrera always kept a very low profile and was never interviewed, and his name was almost never mentioned with that of the other leaders of the Cali cartel. Although it has been argued that he was the source of most of the money involved in the illicit financing of Ernesto Samper's presidential campaign, Herrera himself never spoke of the issue and was never formally involved in the investigation. His name came to light only after a terrorist attack on a soccer field in Candelaria, Valle del Cauca, on September 25, 1990; 20 gunmen dressed in army and police attire opened fire on the crowd where Herrera was sitting, killing 18, but not hitting Herrera. The attack was attributed to the Medellin cartel, and particularly to Pablo Escobar, who apparently blamed Herrera for a car bomb which exploded on January 13, 1988, in the Monaco apartment building owned by Escobar in one of the most affluent areas in the city of Medellin. The war between the cartels shed much of each side's blood, but Herrera took a back role and left the fighting to the Rodriguez brothers. Another attempt on Herrera's life was made on July 27, 1991, in a summer resort, where hooded gunmen wearing pink bracelets shot at the people in the place, killing 17 and hurting 13 others. Herrera was always said to be the main financial provider for the Los Pepes organization, but his name was never officially associated with them. Law enforcement actions In November 1991, the DEA launched Operation Kingpin, which targeted two of Herrera's distribution cells in New York City. Through a largescale wiretap effort, the DEA utilized over 100 simultaneous, court-authorized wiretaps on cellular phones. At the close of Operation Kingpin, nearly 100 traffickers were arrested, and more than $20 million in cash and assets, and over 2.5 tons of cocaine seized. In addition, records of transactions and personnel were seized from computers, which information later provided a greater look into the Cali Cartel cell structure.  Surrender and death  On September 1, 1996, Herrera turned himself in to the Search Bloc (), a unit of the Colombian National Police. Herrera was the last of the four leaders of the Cali Cartel to be captured. He was sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for drug trafficking charges,https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/11/06/colombian- drug-lord-shot-dead/98543888-faa4-4db0-a47d-237a24f90586/ which was extended to 14 years in 1998. Once in jail, Herrera reportedly changed his lifestyle and devoted himself to soccer, becoming the sports organizer in the jail and sponsoring soccer tournaments. He also began a bachelor's degree in business administration. Although he was supposed to be in the maximum security wing of the jail, Herrera visited the other wings, where he would meet with his lawyers. On November 4, 1998, Rafael Angel Uribe Serna, 32, got inside the jail and went to the soccer pitch where Herrera was playing. Uribe was reportedly drunk, but apparently Herrera stopped the game upon seeing him and went to greet him. After hugging Herrera, Uribe took out a gun and shot him seven times in the head. Uribe was caught by other inmates and then taken away by the prison guards, while Herrera was moved to a hospital where he died. There are a number of possible motives for Herrera's assassination. These include old vendettas from members of the Norte del Valle Cartel, in particular a man known by the alias of JJ, by orders of Wilber Varela, who apparently had been the victim some days earlier of an assassination attempt by the Cali cartel leaders and the collaboration between Herrera and DEA for betraying Orlando Henao, chief of the Norte del Valle Cartel. Other hypotheses point to Herrera's long-time conflict against communist guerrillas. The assassin, Uribe, had been a personal adviser of Herrera's for 10 years and was a frequent visitor. Uribe declared that he had decided to kill Herrera because he had threatened Uribe's family when Uribe was unable to kill V√≠ctor Carranza as Herrera had ordered. These declarations, however, were found unreliable, and probably a stratagem to take attention away from the real masterminds. The most accepted hypothesis is that Uribe was actually acting under the orders of the Norte del Valle cartel who were angry with Herrera for having released information about them, and who had been eager to take up the business left behind after the capture or death of the Cali cartel leaders. Uribe was also the uncle of brothers Luis Enrique and Javier Antonio Calle Serna, the \\"Comba\\" brothers, who took hold of the Norte del Valle cartel after Varela died. Uribe himself was assassinated in October, 2009. Sexual orientation In the book, La patrona de Pablo Escobar, written by Colombian journalist Jos√© Guarnizo, Herrera was described as \\"an immigrant who went from being an anonymous Latin mechanic to one of the wealthiest members of the Cartel de Cali\\" and \\"one of the few homosexuals who climbed high in the pyramid of the Mafia\\".http://www.adnradio.cl/noticias/sociedad/pacho-herrera-la-historia-del- lider-homosexual-del-cartel-de-cali/20170822/nota/3556064.aspx At the time, Herrera's crimes overshadowed any speculation regarding his sexual orientation. In the Netflix drama Narcos, Herrera is portrayed as openly gay. In popular culture Herrera is portrayed by Pedro Mogoll√≥n, as the character Hugo de la Cruz in TV Series El cartel. He is portrayed by Daniel Rocha as the character of Gerardo Carrera in the TV Series Escobar, el patr√≥n del mal. In TV series En la boca del lobo is portrayed by Ricardo Vesga as the character of Elver \\"Chacho\\" Barrera. Finally, he is portrayed by Alberto Ammann in the Netflix original series Narcos and Narcos: Mexico.

It was released as the second single from their 1985 UK number one concept album Misplaced Childhood. The follow-up to the UK number two hit \\"Kayleigh\\", the song was their second Top Five UK hit, entering the chart on 7 September 1985, reaching number five and staying on the chart for nine weeks.David Roberts British Hit Singles and Albums, Guinness World Records Limited None of the group's subsequent songs have reached the Top Five and \\"Lavender\\" remains their second highest-charting song. As with all Marillion albums and singles between 1982 and 1988, the cover art was created by Mark Wilkinson. Inspiration and composition The song features a number of verses that are reminiscent of the folk song \\"Lavender's Blue\\". The song forms part of the concept of the Misplaced Childhood album. Like \\"Kayleigh\\" it is a love song, but whereas \\"Kayleigh\\" was about the failure of an adult relationship, \\"Lavender\\" recalls the innocence of childhood: > The childhood theme also brought up the idea of utilising an old children's > song and \\"Lavender\\" was an obvious contender as one of the original pop > songs of its time. > Going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell, \\"Lavender\\" is the little > boy's dream about you can walk through the park and bump into the lady of > your dreams that you're going to fall instantaneously in love with. The opening lines \\"I was walking in the park dreaming of a spark, when I heard the sprinklers whisper, shimmer in the haze of summer lawns\\" deliberately recall the title track of Mitchell's album The Hissing of Summer Lawns. Unusually for a rock song from the mid-1980s, \\"Lavender\\" features a traditional grand piano rather than an electronic keyboard or electric piano. In the music video, keyboardist Mark Kelly is seen playing a Bechstein but the original sleeve notes of the Misplaced Childhood album state that a B√∂sendorfer was used for the recording. On the album Misplaced Childhood, \\"Lavender\\" is a short track of barely two and a half minutes, forming part of a longer suite that continues into the likewise multi-portioned track \\"Bitter Suite\\", which repeats Lavender's musical motif at the end. In order to be suitable for a single release, the track therefore needed to be re-arranged and extended. As a result, the 7\\" version is significantly longer than the album version (3:40 as opposed to 2:27), whereas the 12\\" version ‚Äì entitled \\"Lavender Blue\\" ‚Äì is 4:18. Legacy The song features on several Marillion compilation albums, including A Singles Collection (1992), The Best of Both Worlds (1997) and The Best of Marillion (2003). A CD replica of the single was also part of a collectors box-set released in July 2000 which contained Marillion's first twelve singles and was re-issued as a 3-CD set in 2009 (see The Singles '82‚Äì88').

His work is most notably featured in the Washington National Cathedral where he served as the head of the stained glass department. Early life Lawrence Saint was born in 1885 in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, just outside Pittsburgh. His father, Joseph A. Saint, was also an artist, who specialized in landscape painting and silhouette cutting. Although never formally trained nor immensely successful commercially, Joseph was a talented artist and continued to paint until he was 76 years old. When Lawrence was a young boy, the family moved to De Haven, Pennsylvania (now Allison Park), which was very rural in the late 19th century. Joseph enjoyed the countryside as it inspired him in painting landscapes. They soon moved again to the East End of Pittsburgh where Joseph worked in novelty advertising. At the age of 12, Lawrence sold newspapers. Then at 13, he left school and worked at a wallpaper shop where he learned about color harmony. During his spare time at the shop, he would make sketches of horses or people in the street. Education After seeing one of these sketches, a stained glass artist offered Saint a job as an apprentice in his studio. It was there that Saint learned to grind paint and trace patterns. In 1905, after a three- year apprenticeship, Saint entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to study portrait painting. His second year there, he entered the Cresson Traveling Scholarship, a contest that offered a $500 trip to Europe. After entering, Saint learned that he was required to submit a drawing of a nude woman. Due to his Christian convictions, Saint was ready to drop out of the contest. But a friend suggest he ask to have the drawing exchanged for another. The scholarship committee agreed, and Saint went on to win the scholarship. That trip to Europe would be the first of 5, and was the first time he came face to face with Medieval stained glass. This began his fascination with stained glass which led him to in-depth study of styles and techniques. His last year of art school, Saint worked at an Italian mission on the south side of Philadelphia. It was there that he met Katherine Wright Proctor, who later became his wife. Work Immediately after graduating from art school, Saint got a job with the H.F. Petgen Company in Pittsburgh. It was here that he designed his first stained glass window, a rose window for the Catholic Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in East Liberty, Pittsburgh. The window was a mosaic depicting the signs of the Four Evangelists. Saint wanted to travel to Europe again in 1910. So, in order to take his fianc√©e along with him, they got married just before the trip. The simple ceremony was held at Katherine's house on June 10. The trip to Europe became their honeymoon, and it lasted just over a year. Katherine was a graduate of Wellesley College where she had studied art history, so she was very supportive and helpful to Lawrence in his work. Together they visited and studied many churches in England and France including Chartes Cathedral, Canterbury Cathedral, and Sainte Chapelle in Paris. They would often climb up the sides of the buildings to get a closer look at the windows in order for Lawrence to make drawings of them. Saint's drawings of stained glass windows were published by the Victoria and Albert Royal Museum which included many of them in the book called Stained Glass of the Middle Ages in England and France published in 1913. Saint eventually discovered a process to make his own stained glass in his backyard studio. This was necessary since the finest quality glass was not available on the commercial market at the time. At the height of Saint's career, he was working to produce several windows for the National Cathedral in Washington, DC. His first assignment was the three parable windows in St. Mary's Chapel north of the choir. Each of the three windows depicted seven of Christ's parables. His next assignment was the four miracle windows in St. John's Chapel south of the choir. He also created the large rose window in the northern transept, the three windows beneath it (Foretellers of Judgment), four other windows in the north transept, and three clerestory windows above the choir on the south wall (The Angel Windows. Saint also served for seven years as the head of the Cathedral's Department of Stained Glass. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City filmed an educational video in Saint's studio about stained glass. Today, some of Saint's work can also be viewed at the Cleveland Museum of Art in Cleveland, Ohio. Among Saint's works as a painter were detailed copies of portraits by a number of the Dutch Masters such as Jan Vermeer as well as original paintings of his own done in the style of masters such as Frans Hals. Saint was a serious student and scholar of the techniques of these 16th and 17th century masters, and to that end when creating works in their style instead of using commercial oil paints he made his own from scratch using the same materials, pigments, formulas, and manufacturing techniques developed by Dutch masters.Hand written personal letter from Lawrence Saint to Donald T. Cooper, March 13, 1955 Two of Lawrence Saint's \\"Dutch Master\\" paintings: \\"After Frans Hals\\" (1950) and Jan Vermeer's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" (c1950) (See gallery below for full size images) Personal life The Saint family lived in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. Saint was a Presbyterian who was well known for his dedication to the Christian faith. From 1920 to 1933, the was a ruling elder at the Huntingdon Valley Presbyterian Church. In the late 1950s Saint attended Bethany Baptist Church in the Fox Chase section of Philadelphia where he was a mentor to the church's children. Each child would receive a shiny penny for any bible verse they could recite to him. He inspired many with his outstanding faith and kindness. He was also a member of the Republican Party. He and his wife Katherine had eight children ‚Äì seven boys and one girl. As parents, the Saints were described as being religiously strict, but generally permissive in other areas. Four of his children grew up to work in full-time Christian ministry. Phil was the only child of the family to follow his father as an artist. He used chalk drawings in connection with his preaching ministry. Saint's only daughter, Rachel, was a missionary to Peru and later to Ecuador where she was instrumental in reaching the Huaorani tribe with the gospel. Nate was a missionary pilot who also went to Ecuador. In 1956, Nate was killed during Operation Auca, an earlier attempt to reach the Huaorani. On June 22, 1961, Saint died of a heart attack at 76 years old. He is buried at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Around 1990, she proved a group of major theorems concerning unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces, known as Ratner's theorems. Ratner was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992, awarded the Ostrowski Prize in 1993 and elected to the National Academy of Sciences the same year. In 1994, she was awarded the John J. Carty Award from the National Academy of Sciences.  Biographical information  Ratner was born in Moscow, Russian SFSR to a Jewish family, where her father was a plant physiologist and her mother a chemist. Ratner's mother was fired from work in the 1940s for writing to her mother in Israel, then considered an enemy of the Soviet state. Ratner gained an interest in mathematics in her fifth grade. From 1956 to 1961, she studied mathematics and physics at Moscow State University. Here, she became interested in probability theory, inspired by A.N. Kolmogorov and his group. After graduation, she spent four years working in Kolmogorov's applied statistics group. Following this, she returned to Moscow State university for graduate studies were under Yakov G. Sinai, also a student of Kolmogorov. She completed her PhD thesis, titled \\"Geodesic Flows on Unit Tangent Bundles of Compact Surfaces of Negative Curvature\\", in 1969. In 1971 she emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel and she taught at the Hebrew University from 1971 until 1975. She began to work with Rufus Bowen at Berkeley and later emigrated to the United States and became a professor of mathematics at Berkeley. Her work included proofs of conjectures dealing with unipotent flows on quotients of Lie groups made by S. G. Dani and M. S. Raghunathan. For this and other work, she won the John J.

This means that the rulers of Sumatra embraced esoteric Buddhism at least until the 14th century. In those days it was also thought that trade between Sumatra and South India was going well and there were quite a number of South Indian merchants settled in Minangkabau, as there is also found an inscription (Bandar Bapahat) written in two scripts, the Kawi and the Grantha.

The Japanese adult visual novel Fate/stay night features a number of characters created by Type-Moon, some of whom are classified as Servants with special combat abilities. The characters listed have appeared mainly in two anime television series adaptations (Fate/stay night and Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works) produced by Studio Deen and Ufotable respectively. A Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works animated film was released prior to its TV series. Other characters from the franchise can be found on their respective titles, such as with Fate/Zero, Fate/Apocrypha, Fate/Extra, Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya or Fate/Grand Order. Main characters=Shirou Emiya : :Shirou is a good-hearted and honest teenager, who always enjoys helping others. However, Shir≈ç is a deeply scarred human being who was orphaned after a fire destroyed part of his hometown when he was seven and caused him to lose all memory of the first seven years of his life. He was saved by Kiritsugu Emiya, who adopted him and named him Shir≈ç after discovering that the boy could not recall his real name. He has no interest in the Holy Grail, and instead despises its use. However, he is determined to win the Holy Grail War with Saber, for he hopes his efforts will ensure that another disaster like the Fuyuki fire will never occur again. The main plot of Fate/stay night focuses around his ideal and the three different ways in which he approaches it. Saber : :Saber is both the heroine and servant protagonist of the Fate route. Saber is Shir≈ç's Servant for the Fifth Holy Grail War. Saber acts coldly but is actually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. Saber is frustrated by Shir≈ç's \\"protective\\" tendencies, believing his erratic and reckless behavior will jeopardize their chances of winning the Holy Grail War services as a Heroic Spirit, she asks to be given an opportunity to relive her life, where someone more suitable and effective would lead Britain in her stead. Rin Tohsaka : Rin Tohsaka is a high school who barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone, as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is also secretly a Mage, and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father, Tokiomi Tohsaka, to prioritize sorcery over her own interests. When she was young, Rin was separated from her sister Sakura, who was given to the Matou family for adoption. After her father is killed in the Fourth Holy Grail War, Rin continues to perfect her sorcery with some guidance from her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. Rin serves as the heroine of the Unlimited Blade Works route of Fate/stay night. Archer ; - : :Archer is the partially amnesiac Servant of Rin T≈çsaka. He is sarcastic and cynical, considering Shir≈ç's mentality of \\"wanting to save everyone\\" as na√Øve and impossible. Archer is actually Shir≈ç Emiya from one of the possible future worlds. He is ultimately the winner of the Fifth Holy Grail War in his world and discarded his humanity to become the living incarnation of \\"Justice\\", feared by all due to his unhealthy obsession with justice which led to him killing any and all \\"evil\\" people regardless of their circumstances or what may result from their deaths. He was eventually framed for starting a war by an unknown group and was executed by the fearful public. Unlike the other Servants, Archer is a Counter Guardian, a being that exists outside time and space with the purpose of stopping any event that would cause the extinction of humanity by killing all people involved. This life of endless killing drove Archer mad with grief, and he sought to end his eternal existence and return to nothingness. The jewel he owns is the actual catalyst used for his summoning rather than the one that Rin still has at the time of his summoning. He has taken the basics of magecraft to their absolute maximum to make them combat ready, creating for himself a small but reliable skillset. Though Projection is normally ineffective at creating durable or powerful artifacts, Archer‚Äôs unique approach to this craft enables him to materialize enormously powerful and accurate copies of the images recorded in his mind. All of his Projection abilities come from his Reality Marble, , which manifests itself instead as a desert littered with swords with monolithic black gears rotating in the smog filled sky above. In the Fate route, he is defeated by Berserker while buying time for Rin, Shir≈ç and Saber to escape. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, he seeks to kill Shir≈ç to prevent him from becoming like himself, and ending his own existence as a Counter Guardian. He is defeated by Shir≈ç, but survives long enough to deliver the finishing blow to Gilgamesh and save Rin and Shinji from the Grail's birth canal. In the Heaven's Feel route, Archer is mortally wounded in an engagement against True Assassin, Saber Alter, and The Shadow, but he survives long enough to have Kirei Kotomine surgically graft his left arm onto Shir≈ç, who lost his own arm in that same battle. Sakura Matou : : Sakura is a first-year high school student and the sister of Shinji Matou. After Shirou's father Kiritsugu died, Sakura often visits Shirou's home to help him with his daily chores. Though Shinji is from a family of sorcerers, he asserts that she has no knowledge of her family's craft or history. Sakura is outwardly shy and timid, but possesses great inner strength. She has a long-standing and obvious crush on Shirou Emiya. Sakura plays a minor part in the Fate and Unlimited Blade Works route, being nothing more than a dutiful kouhai (junior student) who is always there to help Shirou in both routes. However, in the Heaven's Feel route, she serves as the story's lead heroine and her backstory is vastly expanded on. In the anime-original storyline, Sakura is kidnapped by Caster as a sacrifice to summon the Holy Grail due to her possessing latent magic circuits. During the rescue attempt, she and Rin are confirmed to be sisters who were separated when they were very young. Rider ; - . : Rider is the servant Shinji, first seen scouting around Shir≈ç's school. Her true identity is Medusa, the gorgon-witch of legend who was remembered as one of its infamous monsters. Rider is silent, sultry, and vigilant, never hesitating to shield her Master from harm. She employs covert battle tactics and takes full advantage of her surroundings. With Shinji incapable of lending Mana to her, she is forced to seek alternative means to augment her abilities such as putting magical seals all over Fuyuki High School that, when activated, drain the life out of any living creature within. This is actually one of her Noble Phantasms, . Her weapon of choice is a pair of long iron nails fastened to opposite ends of a single chain, which she effectively thrusts from distances. Her primary offensive Noble Phantasm is , invoked while riding upon the winged horse Pegasus and is summoned when she stabs her neck. It drives the Pegasus into a killing fury, turning the Pegasus' charge into a wave of energy capable of causing mass destruction. She wears a blindfold, actually another Noble Phantasm, , which seals away her powerful Mystic Eyes, , the that are capable of paralyzing any weaker being who looks at her, instantly turning others into stone. However, in Fate/hollow ataraxia and the True End of Heaven's Feel, she is seen wearing glasses that supplant her blindfold as a seal for her eyes. Rider as the initial antagonist alongside Shinji and is ultimately defeated by Saber. In the manga adaptation of Fate/Stay night, Rider survives only to save her master. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, Rider's role is much more brief as she only engages Shir≈ç once before she is later killed by Caster's master. In the Heaven's Feel route, Sakura is shown to be the true Master of Rider. Rider seeks to protect Sakura despite her murderous deeds due to sharing a kinship with her. After Shir≈ç breaks his alliance with Rin in order to protect Sakura's life, Rider effectively replaces his lost Servant Saber as the guardian of the Emiya household. In the endgame, Shir≈ç and Rider defeat Saber Alter and allow Shir≈ç to save Sakura. Rider then carries an unconscious Sakura and a gravely-injured Rin to safety while Shir≈ç ensures the Holy Grail's destruction. While her ultimate fate in the Normal End is not known, the True End depicts Rider surviving the war and being able to remain in the world without the Grail due to Sakura's massive mana-stores, living peacefully with Shir≈ç and Sakura. Rider is also revealed to have latent feelings for Shir≈ç, due to him being the first male to ever treat her with kindness. Illyasviel \\"Illya\\" von Einzbern ; : :A young Teutonic aristocrat who travels to Japan to participate in the Fifth Holy Grail War as the Master of Berserker. She lives in a castle on the outskirts of Fuyuki City, accompanied only by her Servant and her two maids Leysritt and Sella. In the prequel, Fate/Zero, it is established that Illya is the daughter of Kiritsugu Emiya and Irisviel von Einzbern. Illya was then raised to believe her father abandoned her, not knowing that he actually wanted to save her from the Grail's fate. Illya's desire to learn more about the person Kiritsugu raised in his final years instead of her prompts Illya to observe Shir≈ç in some cases or try to take him like a possession in others, only to start warming up to him after getting to know him when he treats her kindly in spite of her prior attempts to kill him. She is a homunculus like her mother, created to serve as the vessel of the Holy Grail. When wearing the Dress of Heaven and empowered by the deaths of at least six Servants, she is capable of performing a limited version of the Third Magic, , one of the Five types of which can accomplish impossibilities beyond modern science or sorcery. In the Fate route, she serves as the antagonist for the second part of the arc with her servant Berserker as she takes Shir≈ç hostage, torn between wanting to take revenge on him in place of Kiritsugu for her years alone or trying to convince him into being a willing possession of hers to care for. Berserker is defeated by Saber and Shir≈ç working together. When Shir≈ç takes her in after this, she is finally convinced that his concern for her is genuine, and she lives peacefully with Shir≈ç after her Servant is defeated. However, none of them are aware that she will soon die, her homunculus' body having been designed to survive only up to one year after the Fifth Holy Grail War's conclusion. In the Unlimited Blade Works route she is a minor antagonist, she anticipates meeting with Rin and Shir≈ç as they seek her out for an alliance against Caster when the Servant captures Saber, but Illya's own desire to toy with them and stall their approach for her own amusement backfires as it leaves her with only Berserker to defend her when Gilgamesh comes after her. After a brutal battle in which Gilgamesh defeats her servant, Illya ultimately dies weeping over the dying body of Berserker. Illya has a greatly expanded role in the Heaven's Feel and she takes a much more active sisterly role for Shir≈ç early on, helping him through the war and in turn being saved from the Shadow twice over by Shir≈ç. She eventually sacrifices herself to save Shir≈ç and close the Great Holy Grail in the True End. Kirei Kotomine ; : :A priest who acts as the supposedly impartial overseer of the Holy Grail War pursuant to an agreement between the Mages' Association and the Holy Church. He served under the previous Holy Grail War's priest moderator, his father Risei Kotomine, before taking over the position. Due to his experience as an elite assassin for the Church, Kirei is an expert practitioner in Chinese martial arts whose lethalness is magnified by his monstrous physical strength and numerous Command Seals.Fate/complete material II: Character Material ‚Äì‚Äì Characters: Kirei Kotomine, p.066-069. Nasu Kinoko & Takeuchi Takashi-Character Discussion. Takeuchi: Speaking of strength, who is stronger, Ciel or Kotomine? Nasu: Ciel is overwhelmingly strong, due to her circuits, constitution and immortality. The strength of Kotomine at the time of Zero was due to his abnormally large number of Command Spells and his tenacity towards Kiritsugu. It was truly the brightest moment of his life. The Kotomine at that time could even win against Ciel. Despite possessing a strong moral compass, Kirei discovered early in his youth that he could only experience joy through others‚Äô suffering. Originally the master of the Assassin of the Fourth Holy Grail War, Kirei secretly murdered his mentor, Tokiomi T≈çsaka, to obtain Gilgamesh while becoming an indirect caretaker for Rin. It is also revealed in the prequel Fate/Zero that he is responsible for the fire that killed Shir≈ç's biological parents, having indirectly wished for it with his dying breath after being shot by Kiritsugu Emiya. After his revival, he organizes the Fifth Holy Grail War to supply the Grail's cursed contents with enough energy to be unleashed on humanity. In Fate, after kidnapping Ilya to use her as a vessel for the Grail's cursed contents, he partakes in a climactic battle with Shir≈ç who ultimately kills him by destroying his heart with the Azoth Sword. In Unlimited Blade Works, he tries to use Rin as the vessel for the Grail's cursed contents after Gilgamesh killed Illya and stole her heart prior but is killed by Lancer before the climax. In the final route, Heaven's Feel, he serves as both a protagonist and one of the story's primary antagonists by prolonging Sakura Mat≈ç's life Type-Moon.\\"Set position / Rain\\".

However, his plans are foiled when Shiro and Rin manage to convince her she is truly loved thereby giving her the resolve to break free of the entity's hold. As the fully developed Angra Mainyu prepares to enter the world, a mortally wounded Kirei surfaces to prevent Shirou from getting in its way. Subsequently, the two engage in a brutal fight to the death. Accepting defeat, he dies standing upon declaring Shir≈ç the winner of the Fifth Holy Grail War. Gilgamesh ; : :Gilgamesh was originally an Archer in the Fourth Holy Grail War in the service of Tokiomi T≈çsaka before arranging his death by his new partner Kotomine during the end game. In the aftermath of the Fuyuki fire, Gilgamesh gains a physical form through the Holy Grail and contact with Angra Mainyu and spends the next ten years hiding and feeding off the energy of half dead orphans. Resurfacing during the Fifth Holy Grail War, Gilgamesh is shown to have an overt but unrequited lust for Saber and desires her for as long as she denies him. He is unique in that he possesses a very large number of Noble Phantasms, but only three are unique to him: the first is , a key-shaped sword that opens a portal to a mystical vault containing the Noble Phantasms, the second is , a set of nigh-unbreakable binding chains that strengthen and tighten the more divine heritage their target has, and the last is , a gold-lined sword with a cylindrical drill-like black blade consisting of three rotating cylinders that can generate an attack known as that splits the fabric of space and time, capable of overwhelming even Saber's Excalibur with ease. He easily defeats Caster when he makes himself known to Shir≈ç Emiya and the others in the Fate route of the visual novel. Gilgamesh serves as a primary antagonist in the first two routes while playing only a minor role in the third. In Fate, he is killed at the grounds of the Ry≈´d≈ç Temple by Saber. In Unlimited Blade Works, he plans to create a second Uruk by using Angra Mainyu to purge most of the world's human population. His arrogance leads him to be defeated by Shir≈ç, after which he is dragged into the dying Holy Grail just as Shir≈ç is about to deal a fatal blow. He is then killed by a dagger fired by Archer as he is attempting to use Shir≈ç to drag himself out of the Holy Grail, falling back into it and being dissolved. In Heaven's Feel, he attempts to kill Sakura but is destroyed by the Shadow in the process. Supporting characters=Humans ; : :Shir≈ç's adoptive father, a magus who was Saber's Master during the Fourth Holy Grail War, the events of which are covered in Fate/Zero. During his lifetime, Kiritsugu strives to be a Hero of Justice, intending to use the Holy Grail to wish for world peace. However at the conclusion of the Fourth Holy Grail War, after realizing that the Holy Grail was corrupted and cursed, and that the wish it grants only causes destruction, he strives to destroy the Holy Grail. He got his servant Saber to destroy the Grail, but unwittingly triggers the Grail to burst energy that causes a huge fire and destroy Shinto, a region of Fuyuki city where the grail was summoned. Kiritsugu becomes disillusioned when he caused the Fuyuki fire with the Holy Grail's power. Finding Shir≈ç, Kiritsugu adopted him and spent his remaining years raising the child as his son before his body fails him as a result of a curse afflicted by Angra Mainyu. ; : :She is an English teacher at Shir≈ç's school, homeroom instructor of Shir≈ç's class and the supervising teacher for the archery dojo. She is widely called , a nickname she dislikes, but Shir≈ç calls her \\"Fuji-nee\\" (older sister Fuji). After Kiritsugu passes away, Taiga becomes Shir≈ç's guardian and has been living with him for several years. Taiga and Shir≈ç are very close, and she regards him as a younger brother. She is also a skilled swordswoman, wielding a shinai known as the Tora-Shinai that was jokingly said to have absorbed so much bloodlust that it has become a high-level cursed object. She has a grandfather named Raiga. ; : :Issei is the Student Body President of Shir≈ç's school, and another close friend of Shir≈ç. Issei often asks Shir≈ç to fix broken equipment for the Student Body to save money on school expenses. Issei and Shir≈ç often have lunch together in the Student Body office where they talk about what ever comes to mind. His father is the head priest of Ry≈´d≈ç Temple, and his brother was a classmate of Taiga and Neko-san. ; : Sakura Matou's older brother, and a long-time friend of Shirou until Shirou discovered Shinji beating Sakura, at which point Shirou beat Shinji within an inch of his life. Shinji is very popular as vice-captain of the archery dojo despite being chauvinistic and a narcissist. Like Rin Tohsaka, he is of a distinguished lineage of Japanese sorcerers (though his family is originally from Russia), though the Matou blood has thinned and no longer produces heirs naturally capable of sorcery. Shinji feels uncomfortable with his sister's daily visits to Shirou's home. He has an open crush on Rin, but she does not return his feelings. He participates in the Fifth Holy Grail War as a Master, with Rider as his Servant, although he does not have Mage abilities. He is beaten and humiliated by Shirou, who almost crushes Shinji's throat for using the school as a power source. He has a Command Seal created by his younger sister, who is Rider's true Master. In the Fate route, after Rider loses to Saber, his book burns up; he flees but is killed by Berserker. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, he is implanted with the heart of Illya, the seed of the Holy Grail by Gilgamesh, but is later rescued by Rin Tohsaka and ultimately survives. In the Heaven's Feel route, he is ousted as a false Master as Rider returns to her true Master, Sakura. It is revealed that he had been raping Sakura for many years. In a fit of fright, Sakura murders Shinji. ; : :Kuzuki is an instructor in Rin's class. Kuzuki is well respected among staff and students. He is actually a highly trained assassin who has no qualms about letting his servant Caster, whom he is in love with, do whatever she wants, even if the actions are considered evil. He has been staying at Issei Ryoudou's place for three years and is regarded by Issei as a brother. In the anime and the \\"Unlimited Blade Works\\" route of the visual novel, he has Caster enhance the power of his fists. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, in which he is revealed as Caster's Master, whom she made a contract with after killing her original Master (known in the anime as Atram Galiast). After his Servant is killed by Archer's hail of swords, he is defeated in melee by Archer. In the Heaven's Feel route, Kuzuki is never seen but is described as having been killed by unknown means during the Shadow's attack on the temple, with Saber and Shir≈ç arriving soon after to find Caster standing over his dead body in shock. Caster is shown as having gone mad with grief over his death and denoting that she might as well have killed him with her own hands if this outcome was the end result of him being her Master, ultimately being killed by Saber in the ensuing fight. The Fate anime adaptation depicts him dying at Gilgamesh's hands. ; : :Z≈çken is a powerful, ancient magus and the patriarch of the Mat≈ç family. Despite being centuries old, Shinji and Sakura refer to him as their grandfather. Hailing from Russia, his original name is Makiri Zolgen. He is ultimately revealed to be one of the original three Magi who created the Holy Grail system as well as the designer of the Command Seals. During the course of his long lifetime, Z≈çken has amassed an enormous wealth of knowledge and experience in magecraft. However, his training is indistinguishable from physical and psychological torture (a fact only exacerbated by Z≈çken's sadism). He has kept himself alive through the use of Crest Worms and can only be killed if the worm he planted in Sakura's heart is destroyed. He only appears in the Heaven's Feel route, but is the main antagonist of the route and also has an expanded role in the prequel, Fate/Zero. He originally controls Dark Sakura, but she eventually turns on him and destroys his body, reducing him to a single worm. After seeing Illya in her Dress of Heaven and remembering why he fought to survive for so long, he is able to stop clinging to life and die in peace. Servants ; - : The first hostile Servant to appear in the story. His true identity is C√∫ Chulainn, the \\"child of light\\" from Ireland and one of its most famed heroes. He has a playful attitude and takes a very carefree approach to life, but is quick to work himself into a frenzy during a heated battle. His Noble Phantasm is . When activated, it reverses the laws of cause and effect, meaning that the fact that the next strike will hit the opponent's heart becomes a foregone conclusion, even before the spear is thrust. This causes its next strike to become completely unavoidable and fatal, ignoring all magical and physical protection, bending at impossible angles and around obstacles. The only way to survive this technique is to be blessed with a large degree of luck in order to have the spear strike a region other than the heart, as avoiding the blow is impossible. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, he also uses , which maximizes G√°e Bolg's true capabilities as a thrown weapon. In the Fate route, his death is not seen. His death is portrayed in Studio Deen's anime adaptation of the Fate route as being the result of Gilgamesh. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, he offers to temporarily become allies with Shir≈ç and Rin after Caster steals Saber and Archer betrays Rin to join her, becoming the pair's subsidiary Servant. Lancer discovers Kirei's hand in the mess when the Priest explains he'd manipulated the events to his advantage, intending to use Rin as the vessel for the Holy Grail. He then collapses from a fatal wound after being ordered to commit suicide via Command Spell, but not before killing Kirei and stabbing Shinji Mat≈ç. He then sets fire to the Einzbern castle with magic before fading away. In the Heaven's Feel route, Lancer dies early on, being killed by True Assassin. ; - : The Servant of Illya, who appears as a giant with adamantine skin and gross brawn. His true identity is Heracles, a legendary hero and demigod of Greece and the son of the Ruler of the Gods, Zeus. He wields a colossal axe-sword, and is capable of causing massive destruction with the mere backlash of his swings. Berserkers are praised as members of the \\"Strongest\\" class, though they are difficult to control and can turn on their Masters. Berserker's main Noble Phantasm is , which grants automatic resurrection, up to 11 resurrections - meaning Berserker needs to be killed 12 times to be eliminated, one for each of Hercules's twelve labors. Berserker also possess a Noble Phantasm called , which is the legendary bow and arrow set used by Hercules to slay the nine- headed Hydra. Shir≈ç uses it in the Heaven's Feel route, projecting Berserker's own axe-sword against Dark Berserker to remove all his remaining lives in one go in a modified technique known as . In the anime and the \\"Fate\\" route of the visual novel, Shir≈ç and Saber perform a joint special attack with a traced Caliburn, Saber's lost Noble Phantasm, and kill him. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, Gilgamesh binds the Servant down with his divine chains and pelts him with weapons. In the \\"Heaven's Feel\\" route, Berserker is defeated by Saber Alter - the corrupted form of Saber - and is then consumed by Angra Mainyu and reborn as the decrepit Dark Berserker. He is later killed by Shir≈ç Emiya. ; : (Japanese), David Vincent (Fate/stay night, UBW film), Todd Haberkorn (UBW TV) (English)Fate/stay night Blu-Ray 2 - Review - Anime News Network :A solitary Servant, clothed in a traditional Japanese hakama and kimono with an indigo haori. He initially claims to be , but in reality he is a nameless samurai \\"who forged his past and is a master swordsman only in people's memories\\". He was summoned by Caster as a guardian and watchman for the front gate of the Ry≈´d≈ç Temple. As an improper servant, Assassin is entirely dependent on Caster for mana and cannot move freely beyond the grounds of Ry≈´d≈ç Temple. Because of his limited status, Assassin only seeks to enjoy a decent sword fight. His special move is the , an unblockable attack that hits from three directions simultaneously, reaching into parallel dimensions. It is a sword skill of the highest degree that requires no mana other than that needed for Assassin to move, and as such is incredibly efficient. It is a sure-kill move, although in a different sense from G√°e Bolg. In Fate/Hollow ataraxia, he is described as having been killed by Gilgamesh. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, he faces Saber once after letting Shir≈ç and Archer pass in order to let them cause inconvenience for Caster, later letting Saber leave with her Master after Shir≈ç is wounded by Archer as a sign of respect for her abilities and desire to defend her comrade. He is defeated by Saber on the last night of the Holy Grail War. In the Heaven's Feel route, Assassin's flesh serves as Z≈çken Mat≈ç's catalyst for summoning True Assassin, with the latter bursting out from within his flesh. ; - : :She is an honored guest of the Ry≈´d≈ç family, permitted to live at their temple until the preparations for her marriage have been finalized. Her true identity is Medea, the disgraced princess of Colchis who was branded a witch as a result of actions outside her control. Unlike other Servants, she does not wield a weapon for physical combat, but her rank allows her to manipulate Mana and perform magic like a wizard, something which other Servants cannot do. Her magical ability far surpasses modern Magi, due to her technique, . This allows her to cast spells which would normally take minutes to cast by uttering a single word. Because of her Magus ability, she has a dual role as a Servant to Kuzuki, and a Master of Assassin. Her Noble Phantasm is , an otherwise weak dagger which dispels all forms of magic that it comes in contact with. Its greatest use is in severing the bond between Master and Servant. She also possesses a Noble Phantasm called , a coat of golden fleece which is capable of summoning the original Colchis dragon that guarded it after it is thrown upon the ground. :In the Fifth Holy Grail War, shortly after her summoning, she kills her original Master Atram Galiast within a few days, and is later taken in by her current Master S≈çichir≈ç Kuzuki at the Ry≈´d≈ç Temple. Caster quickly fell in love with S≈çichir≈ç, for he was the first man to show her genuine kindness, dedication and loyalty. Her primary objective shifted from obtaining the Holy Grail for herself to simply preserving their short time together. To that end, she takes the souls of other beings to sustain herself and strengthen her defensive power, as Kuzuki is incapable of providing her with Mana. In the anime-original storyline, she kidnaps Sakura by possessing her body and stabbing Saber with Rule Breaker, but, because of Saber's A-ranked magic resistance, she was only able to take away Saber's ability to use her Noble Phantasm. She then tries to sacrifice Sakura, who has latent Magus abilities, to summon the Holy Grail directly. She is then defeated by Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon in her underground city. In the Fate route, she is defeated by Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon while attempting to attack the Emiya household. In the Unlimited Blade Works route, she is the primary antagonist of the first third of the route. She personally stabs Saber with Rule Breaker, turning her into her Servant for a short time, but is later betrayed and defeated by Archer, who showers her with a barrage of Noble Phantasms from Unlimited Blade Works. In the Heaven's Feel route, she is killed by Saber early on after losing Assassin and Kuzuki in an attack by the Shadow, but Z≈çken Mat≈ç uses one of his worm familiars to maintain her body as a puppet for a brief period of time before it is slain by Saber. ; - : :True Assassin is a Servant due to his ability to attack outside battle. True Assassin's identity is that of the legendary Persian \\"Old Man of the Mountain\\", Hassan-i Sabbah, the leader of al-Assasƒ´n, but he later states that the name Hassan was passed down along with the leadership of the sect through many generations and that he himself was not the original Old Man of the Mountain, nor was he likely the last. His Noble Phantasm is , a long, satanic, three-metre long right arm which replaces the heart of whoever it touches with a fake substitute. He is the Servant of Z≈çken Mat≈ç, and only appears in the Heaven's Feel route, bursting out from within Assassin's flesh when Z≈çken uses the dying Servant's body as the catalyst to summon him. It is devoured by the Shadow and corrupted into Saber Alter. He attempts to kill Shir≈ç immediately after but is defeated by Rider, who comes to Shir≈ç's defense at the behest of her true master - revealed later to be Sakura Mat≈ç. He later is destroyed by Sakura's Shadow when Sakura turns on Z≈çken as revenge for his years of tormenting her. Minor characters ; and : :These two women are Illya's maids, but they act as her caretakers and instruct her in the secrets of sorcery. Like Illya, they both have silky white hair and deep crimson eyes. Sella is rather fickle and insecure (especially regarding her body), and is very suspicious of Shir≈ç Emiya. In contrast, Leysritt is far more casual, and carries some affection for Shir≈ç because his presence makes Illya happy. Leysritt is skilled in combat, particularly with halberds, and she is able to sacrifice her life to manifest The Dress of Heaven, an artifact of the Einzbern family capable of limited applications of , miracles that can accomplish impossibilities beyond modern science or sorcery. ; : :A stellar athlete, and captain of the archery dojo. Ayako and Rin are actively competing to see who will be the first to snag a boyfriend. She is close friends with Shir≈ç, despite her outgoing and extroverted attitude making him uncomfortable, and wishes to see Shir≈ç smile, something she has never seen him do. She is victimized by Rider or Caster early in the story and later found unconscious in an alleyway. In the anime, Ayako is seen with Shinji after her disappearance, although Shinji denies it when asked by Shir≈ç. Ayako often asks Shir≈ç to come to the archery dojo and watch them practice. After she is attacked, Ayako is said to be recovering in hospital, but is not seen again. ; : :Yukika is the gentle manager of the Track Team, warmly loved by the majority of her class. She is one of the few people able to see Assassin at the Ry≈´d≈ç Temple gate, and strikes up a conversation with him in Fate/hollow ataraxia. ; : :Kaede is a beautiful but loud and obnoxious sprinter known as the Panther of Homura. A friend of Rin T≈çsaka, the two often go window- shopping together. Her hobby is collecting wind chimes. ; : :Kane is one of Yukika and Kaede's friends, and a high jumper, and is also the protagonist of Fate/School Life. She is considerate and intelligent. She has feelings for Shir≈ç. Her father is the mayor of Fuyuki City. Her hobby is painting. ; :Otoko is Shir≈ç's employer, and owner of a liquor store, The Copenhagen Bar. She dislikes her given name, Otoko (phonically identical to the Japanese word for \\"male\\"), preferring to be called \\"Neko\\". She feels attached to Shir≈ç and always addresses him by a pet name, \\"Emi-yan\\". \\"Neko\\" considers Taiga to be a bad influence on her hard-working employee. ; :Better known as the grandfather of Taiga, Raiga is the Oyabun (ÁµÑÈï∑ family head) of a yakuza group operating in Fuyuki City. He was an old friend of Kiritsugu Emiya, and as a favor, manages Kiritsugu's estate after his death in place of Shir≈ç. He is also Shir≈ç's de facto guardian, due to Taiga's general incompetence, and often takes Shir≈ç hunting or to sumo matches, paying him for his time. ; :Zelretch is one of five living sorcerers capable of \\"true magic\\". Zelretch's particular miracle is known as the \\"Kaleidoscope\\", which gives him dominion over alternate possibilities. Originally introduced in Tsukihime, he makes a cameo appearance in the Heaven's Feel scenario of Fate/stay night as Rin's magus teacher. ; : :A descendant of the Edelfelt family, who participated in the Third Holy Grail War with twin Masters, believing it would be advantageous for them to have two Servants as well as due to their Crest being split in half, though the family has not participated since. Luvia is an outstanding but arrogant student at the Mage's Association and frequently gets into fights with other students, including Rin T≈çsaka, her cousin. She is notably famous in the non-magical world due to her job as a professional wrestler, where she is known as the \\"Forklift Lady\\" due to her immense strength. Her powers are similar to Rin's. Luvia's first proper appearance is in Fate/hollow ataraxia where she is Shir≈ç's partner and admirer, working with him to investigate mysterious magical incidents on behalf of the Mage's Association. She was later seen in the final episode of the anime series adaptation of Unlimited Blade Works, once again as a fellow student to Rin and Shir≈ç with her affections for the latter and rivalry with the former intact. ; :Known as the Saint of Winter, Justeaze was a homunculus whose family desired the Holy Grail long before the Holy Grail Wars began. When their attempts continued to fail, the Einzbern reluctantly accepted the aid of the T≈çsaka and Makiri (Mat≈ç) families and under the guidance of Zelretch, they formed the Holy Grail Wars. Justeaze agreed to form the core of the Holy Grail; as such, her descendants (Illyasviel von Einzbern and her mother, Irisviel) each contain within them parts of Justeaze's memories and personality as well as a genetic resemblance to her. She also indirectly assists her adoptive descendant Shir≈ç, as it is through her memories that he is able to create a copy of the Jeweled Sword Zelretch near the climax of Heaven's Feel. She is also the cause of Z≈çken's actions in Heaven's Feel, as Z≈çken (back when he was still Zolgen) had decided to use the Grail to create world peace as a tribute to his lost lover, but eventually forgot due to his ever-advancing age and creeping insanity. ; : :The former Master of Caster who was originally mentioned in the visual novel, until his actual appearance in the second anime adaptation of Unlimited Blade Works in which his role was explained. Atrum initially summoned Caster with the intent of taking advantage of her ability to summon the original dragon of Colchis. However, once Caster stated that while she indeed had the knowledge to summon said dragon but not on how to control it, Atrum dismisses Caster as useless. ; : :One of the Knights of the Round Table, Bedivere is Altria's care-taker and one of the stewards of the royal court. Only appearing in the final scenes in the Fate Route, he came to serve the young king out of admiration of her, entrusting his sword to her and working to become her personal guard. As the years passed up to her passing in the Battle of Camlann, he tends to her in her final moments in her life. He was happy that he finally saw his wish for her: a peaceful sleep that she had never been able to obtain. Happy the fact he thanked someone in another time on giving her peace, he watches over her and asks her if she's watching the continuation of her dream. :Bedivere played a major role in the 6th chapter of Fate/Grand Order as a summonable servant, in both game and the upcoming movie adaptation. Reception The visual novel noted that such use of the heroes of the legends of antiquity can also encourage acquaintance with their original sources.Josiah Lebowitz, Chris Klug.

As a result, Tsunehiro views Shirou's change in each route as a way to recover from the trauma, grow up and become an independent person. A large number of sudden deaths, coupled with a sharp effect of losing control over the situation, according to the authors of the monograph, gave the gameplay an additional emotional coloring and motivated players to continue playing the game, aided by well-developed plot twists.Lebowitz, Klug, 2011, p. 265. In his analysis of the magical system and details of the personalities of the characters, Makoto Kuroda sees in the idea of Shirou to become a ‚Äúchampion of justice‚Äù a direct analogy with the traditional view of the life of bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism, seeking to save other people at the cost of their own efforts and suffering. In Kuroda's view, Buddhist concepts are opposed to the elements of Christian ethics contained in the plot through the opposition of Shirou and Kirei Kotomine in the form of the main character's rejection of the interpretation of Angra Mainyu as a creature who accepted the sins of others in the name of salvation. The images of Rin, Saber and Sakura received conflicting ratings. Thus, many reviewers recognized that the psychologically deepest arc is \\"Heaven's Feel\\", which is largely due to the sharp and versatile disclosure of the image of Sakura Matou,Lebowitz, Klug, 2011, p. 121.TYPE‚ÄêMOON 10th Anniversary Phantasm/ Type-Moon. ‚Äî Kadokawa Shoten, 2012. ‚Äî 399 —Å. ‚Äî and her romantic line with Shirou is the most \\"adult\\" among all the heroines. Some reviewers commented on Shirou's relationship with Saber and on his growth in Studio Deen's anime that improves their personalities and adds romance to their relationship as the plot progresses. Kirtisugu's relationship wih Kirei was the subject of praise. The Fandom Post and Blu-ray enjoyed Shirou's characterization in the film, in which his ideals contrast with those of Archer and Kiritusgu, making him notably mature in the story.

It features two curved towers connected by a \\"halo\\" sky bridge that will light up like a beacon at night.Condo design for Pearl Bank site unveiled 14 May 2019. Straits Times. One Pearl Bank is designed by Serie+Multiply, a joint venture between London-based Serie Architects and Singapore-based Multiply Architects. The development will house a total of 774 apartments. Architecture An aerial perspective of the Pearl Bank Apartments. (shot October 2018) The architecture of the building is observed to be influenced by Brutalismhttps://issuu.com/iremembersg/docs/brutalist_architecture, a popular architectural style, not just in Singapore but around the world, during the 1970s. It was designed by Singaporean architect Tan Cheng Siong of Archurban Architects Planners who took inspiration in the resemblance of the site to an airplane tail (the area of Pearl Bank Apartments is roughly in the shape of a triangle when viewed from the sky looking down). It would eventually lead to the idea of a high-rise tower that rivals the peak of Bukit Timah Hill (the tallest natural point on the island) to take advantage of the panoramic view of Singapore. The Pearl Bank Apartments is a 38-storey hollow ¬æ cylindrical tower, resembling a horseshoe, designed for a total occupancy of 1,500 persons. When completed in 1976, the building had the largest number of apartments contained in a single block, a grand total of 280, and had the highest density of any private modern residential building at 1,853 persons per hectare. The horseshoe shape of the tower was designed for efficiency as it was economical in terms of material used, offering the smallest wall-to- floor ratio. Its cylindrical shape allows for daylight, ventilation and maximum panoramic views to all its units as well as connect residents to their neighbours whereas the opening in the circular structure faces west and minimises direct penetration of heat and light from the afternoon sun into the building. The slits in the circular slab also allow for effective ventilation into the internal courtyard. The tower envelopes an inner void spanning 30m facing the building's internal central courtyard. The 280-unit apartment block comprises three types of split-level units ‚Äì 48 two-bedroom (), 184 three- bedroom () and 40 four-bedroom () dwellings, with eight units to each floor ‚Äì and an additional eight penthouses. There is a shopping area with seven units on the first storey and the building has a four-storey carpark located next to the driveway leading to the building's lobby on Pearl Bank. The 28th storey is devoted for community use, known as the \\"Sky Park\\", similar to a void deck in HDB flats all around Singapore. The effect of the split-level architectural approach in the spatial planning is expressed as an important facet of the building. Each apartment unit is further zoned into \\"public\\" and \\"private\\" areas to offer maximum exclusivity and views to the occupants. The dry areas such as the bedrooms and living rooms are located on the outer rim whereas the utilities and service areas are located at the rear of the apartments, overlooking the building's central courtyard, to avoid any obstruction of the view. The building's structure comprises ten radiating shear walls which also serve as party walls between the units. These elements, along with the additional structural columns and lift cores, follow the radial form of the building and enhances the fa√ßade. Shanghai plaster is used on the outer rim of the building and painted plastered walls on the inner rim. Originally unpainted on the outer fa√ßade, with the raw concrete visibly showing, the building was painted cream with orange details (such as the inner-rim connecting staircases) in 2008.  Construction Difficulties  > \\"Pearl Bank was completed in 1976 because it took a bit of time, with > difficulties in construction and financing; building such a building in > those days was rather taxing, especially when many new technologies needed > to be employed. Because there was no precedent to the construction of such a > high building locally, financing the project involved great risks. As > architects, we had to struggle to work with the developer to reduce the > costs, making sure things worked economically, and convince the bankers of > our methods.\\" > -Tan Cheng Siong, architect of Pearl Bank Apartments. In a bid to complete the construction of the apartments in the shortest time possible in the 1970s and without any local precedents found for such high- rise buildings, new technologies were employed. Particularly, the slip-form construction technique was employed on a residential development in Singapore for the first time. With the specified construction method, the building speed of two days per storey, which was quite fast for the time, was achievable. Although so, the speed of construction of the vertical members were erected in such short time, the horizontal members experienced a hard time catching up. Furthermore, the wooden slip-platform caught fire in an accident as well, further delaying the construction for a few months. After piling started in the early 1970s in midst of a property boom, construction was further delayed as well due to material and labour shortages. However, by the end of the early 1970s, everything was almost back on track, leading to the building's completion in 1976.  Conservation Efforts  Pearl Bank Apartments demolition (shot in Feb 2020) The Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had previously agreed that there were merits to conserving the apartments as it had been one of the pioneering high-rise residential projects of a developing Singapore as well as being the precedent of future high-rise residential developments. Pearl Bank Apartments demolition (shot in Feb 2020) Conservation efforts were spearheaded by architects, the owners, heritage- lovers as well as students to preserve Pearl Bank Apartments for its high architectural and historical significance and value. American architect Ed Poole, who moved into a penthouse unit in the apartments in 2000, started rallying against the multiple en-bloc attempts by opening the website, pearlbankapartments.com, which is now defunct. Poole was determined to transform the image of Pearl Bank Apartments which had become known as a dormitory for foreign workers into the residential heritage icon it was claimed to be. Various media publications were published as well exploring the narrative and the significance of the apartments for the country's historical and architectural advancement as well as the residents' emotional attachments to the unique architecture, which can almost never be found elsewhere in the world. Many of the residents' stances that lead towards en-bloc is mostly due to the looming expiry of the 99-year land-lease as well as the apparent deterioration of the building. Residents cited many of the building's infrastructure has been failing, such as water and piping leakage, the general unfriendly physical environment for elderly (and the disabled), lifts often breaking down and rat infestations. While many were reluctant to move and would choose to stay if they could, the uncertainty of the building ever getting any better was looming. The value of the property decreases as more time goes by as well. In 2012, the building's principal architect Tan Cheng Siong and the owners proposed a voluntary conservation project. As concerns were that the apartments did not meet the conditions of 'land use intensification or urban rejuvenation' as well as the deteriorating conditions of the building, Tan had proposed to increase the gross floor area of Pearl Bank Apartments. The proposal was to build on top of the four-storey carpark and build a new block of 150 apartments and to include additional communal spaces such as an infinite pool and refurbish the current tower. The sale from the apartments would pay for both the refurbishments and the topping up of the apartment's 99-year lease and hence would not require any money from the tenants. Although about 91% of the tenants signed for the project, it fell short of the 100% approval needed by URA to proceed with the conservation. This created a dissatisfaction among the pro-conservation group as en-bloc only requires 80% of the consensus to proceed; a whole 20% lower than was needed for conservation. As such, the voluntary conservation project was not able to proceed and was scrapped. After en-bloc, Pearl Bank Management Corporation Strate Title (MCST) chairman Ceciila Seet noted that there is no conservation mentioned in the collective sale agreement. Thus, possibly to the chagrin of those in favour of holding on to Pearl Bank Apartments, it is unlikely for the building to be conserved. Instead, CapitaLand has promised to incorporate and blend 'heritage elements with modern aesthetics' to reflect the culture of Chinatown stemming from the existing structure.

The definition is not completely straightforward, but is designed to allow as many theorems about subsequences to generalize to nets as possible. If (xŒ±) and (yŒ≤) are nets from directed sets A and B respectively, then (yŒ≤) is a subnet of (xŒ±) if there exists a monotone final function :h : B -> A such that :yŒ≤ = xh(Œ≤). A function h : B ‚Üí A is monotone if Œ≤1 ‚â§ Œ≤2 implies h(Œ≤1) ‚â§ h(Œ≤2) and final if its image is cofinal in A--that is, for every Œ± in A there exists a Œ≤ in B such that h(Œ≤) ‚â• Œ±.Some authors use a slightly more general definition of a subnet. In this definition, the map h is required to satisfy the condition: For every Œ± ‚àà A there exists a Œ≤0‚àà B such that h(Œ≤) ‚â• Œ± whenever Œ≤ ‚â• Œ≤0. Such a map is final but not necessarily monotone. While complicated, the definition does generalize some key theorems about subsequences: *A net (xŒ±) converges to x if and only if every subnet of (xŒ±) converges to x. *A net (xŒ±) has a cluster point y if and only if it has a subnet (yŒ≤) that converges to y. *A topological space X is compact if and only if every net in X has a convergent subnet (see net for a proof). A seemingly more natural definition of a subnet would be to require B to be a cofinal subset of A and that h be the identity map. This concept, known as a cofinal subnet, turns out to be inadequate. For example, the second theorem above fails for the Tychonoff plank if we restrict ourselves to cofinal subnets. While a sequence is a net, a sequence has subnets that are not subsequences. For example the net (1, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...) is a subnet of the net (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The key difference is that subnets can use the same point in the net multiple times and the indexing set of the subnet can have much larger cardinality. Using the more general definition where we don't require monotonicity, a sequence is a subnet of a given sequence, if and only if it can be obtained from some subsequence by repeating its terms and reordering them., Satz 2.8.3, p. 81 NotesReferences  * Category:Topology ","title":"Subnet (mathematics)"},{"id":"12687862","text":"Lia Wyler (October 6, 1934 ‚Äì December 11, 2018) was a Brazilian translator.

Death On 17 July 1984, Morelle visited a ground-floor apartment on Sanguinet Street in Montreal that she was considering renting. The landlord was not there, but had told her earlier that she could go in anytime she wished because the apartment was not locked. That evening she failed to show up for a play in which was performing, and police found her body in the apartment the next day: she had been strangled. Her funeral was attended by over 1,000 friends, supporters, and colleagues, including Michel Tremblay and Jean Duceppe. A small park in the Le Plateau district of Montreal has since been named after her. Investigation No apparent motive existed for her murder, and it was initially the subject of hysterical speculation in the press and amongst the public. It remained entirely unsolved until 8 August 2007, when investigators from the major crimes division of the Montreal police arrested 49-year-old Gaetan Bissonnette, who had been identified from a DNA sample he had provided for an unrelated reason. The TV network TVA claimed that a program it had aired on the case had led to the discovery. Bissonnette appeared before court on 9 August, accused of first-degree murder, but pleaded guilty to a reduced second-degree murder charge. On November 30, 2007, he was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 20 years.

Background  Dou Dexuan was born in 598, during the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui. His family had been a hereditary aristocratic family during Sui and its predecessor dynasties Northern Zhou and Western Wei, and his grandfather Dou Zhao (Á´áÁÖß) had married a daughter of Western Wei's paramount general and ancestor to Northern Zhou's imperial house, Yuwen Tai, who was later known as Princess Yiyang during Northern Zhou,That Dou Zhao's wife was Yuwen Tai's daughter was per Dou Dexuan's biography in the New Book of Tang, which referred to her as the daughter of \\"Emperor Wen of Zhou,\\" Emperor Wen being Yuwen Tai's posthumously honored name after his son Emperor Xiaomin of Northern Zhou became Northern Zhou's founding emperor. See New Book of Tang, vol. 95. The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang's work the Family Records of the Chinese Emperors, Empresses, Princes, and Princesses (‰∏≠ÂúãÂ∏ùÁéãÁöáÂêéË¶™ÁéãÂÖ¨‰∏ª‰∏ñÁ≥ªÈåÑ), vol. 2, indicated that Dou Zhao's wife was the daughter of Emperor Wen of Western Wei. It is not known whether Princess Yiyang was Dou Dexuan's grandmother. and he was created the Duke of Julu. Dou Dexuan's father Dou Yan (Á´áÂΩ•) inherited the title and served as a commandery governor during Sui. His older brother Dou Deming (Á´áÂæ∑Êòé) served on the staff of Emperor Taizong of Tang while he was the Prince of Qin. His granduncle Dou Wei was chancellor during the reign of Emperor Taizong's father and Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu. Dou Dexuan himself was said to start his career in civil service when he was first an imperial university student during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui. He served as a guard commander for Emperor Gaozu of Tang briefly before he seized the throne from Yang You, in 517 or 518. His activities during Emperor Gaozu's reign were not clear, but historical records indicated that he did not have much success in the political arena during Emperor Taizong's reign.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  It was said that after Emperor Gaozong became emperor in 649, Dou had served as deputy director of palace affairs, and he was promoted to the post of imperial censor on the basis of his long service to the empire. In or after 662, probably in 664, he was promoted to the post of minister of census, a more important post. It was said that he was one of more than a dozen officials who were promoted around the same time by Emperor Gaozong personally, including the future chancellors Liu Xiangdao, Shangguan Yi, and Hao Chujun, and it was recorded also that Emperor Gaozong selected them \\"to show the chancellors, including Li Ji,\\" although what exactly Emperor Gaozong was showing the chancellors was not clearly stated. In 664, he was also made acting Zuo Xiang (Â∑¶Áõ∏) -- the head of the examination bureau of government and a post considered one for a chancellor. It was said that Dou, as chancellor, was hard-working and careful. In 665, as Emperor Gaozong was planning to sacrifice to heaven and earth at Mount Tai, and he had Dou and Li Ji serve as his attendants. On the way from the eastern capital Luoyang to Mount Tai, as Emperor Gaozong was passing through Puyang, Emperor Gaozong, remembering that Puyang was formerly known as Diqiu (Â∏ù‰∏ò, literally \\"the hill of the emperor\\"), asked Dou the reason, and Dou could not answer. Another chancellor, Xu Jingzong, happened to be nearby, and responded that Diqiu was named as such because the legendary emperor Zhuanxu had his capital there. Xu later made the comment, \\"A high level official must be knowledgeable. When I saw that Dou Dexuan could not answer, I felt ashamed for him.\\" When Dou heard this, he said, \\"A person has things that he can do and things he cannot do. My ability is to know what I do not know and not pretend that I know it.\\" The people who heard this exchange admired Dou for his honesty‚Äîparticularly Li Ji, who commented, \\"It is a good thing that Xu Jingzong is knowledgeable. But Dou Dexuan's words were also deep truths.\\" After Emperor Gaozong completed the sacrifices in spring 666, he was set to upgrade Dou's title by two grades.This implied that Dou already had a noble title prior to this time, but historical records do not indicate what it was. Dou, citing that his brother Dou Deyuan (Á´áÂæ∑ÈÅ†) had no titles, offered to have the title given to Dou Deyuan instead. Emperor Gaozong partially agreed with him, creating him the Baron of Julu, while creating Dou Deyuan the Baron of Le'an. Dou Dexuan died in the fall of that year, while still serving as chancellor. It was written by historians that Dou Dexuan was a careful observer of trends and had no faults, but he also did not benefit the state by his service. His son Dou Huaizhen later also served as a chancellor.  Notes and references  * New Book of Tang, vol. 95. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 201.

Gameplay In Primal Prey, the player must hunt dinosaurs across five episodes. Each episode contains several missions that allows the player to either hunt or trap eight dinosaur species and one pterosaur:(Tyrannosaurus, Utahraptor, Troodon, Gastonia, Triceratops, Styracosaurus, Iguanodon, Lambeosaurus and Quetzalcoatlus). A few of the missions allow the player to hunt dinosaurs for trophies. Each mission has its own storyline, and the player has to capture or kill a certain dinosaur, which they can bring back with them for a reward. Critical reception GameSpot rated Primal Prey as \\"bad\\", criticising the single map for being too small to allow the \\"tracking\\" game mechanics to be effective, the strange behaviour of the dinosaur's AI, and excessive fog which renders some equipment pointless (such as the sniper scope and night vision goggles). It was also considered graphically inferior to the similar Carnivores series. However, the shrink ray weapon was viewed as the game's one original idea.

He is most known for a series of 76 drawings that were later bound into a ledger book that depicts scenes of Lakota life and rituals. The ledger drawings were commissioned by William Edward Canton, a federal \\"Indian trader\\" at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Black Hawk's drawings were drawn between 1880-1881. Today they are known as one of the most complete visual records of Lakota cosmology, ritual and daily life.  Cheyenne River Indian Reservation  Knowledge of the Sioux Indians was first recorded by the French explorer Jean Nicolet in 1640. Originally the Sioux occupied the region that is now Minnesota; however, they moved west in the 18th century to avoid conflict with neighboring tribes who had been armed by French fur traders. There are 7 sub tribes within the Great Sioux Nation. They are often referred to as the 7 council fires. One such sub tribe the Teton Sioux is also known as the Lakota people. The Lakota are then divided into 7 additional tribes which includes the Sans Arc or It√°zipƒçho tribe. In 1868 the Fort Leramie Treaty situated the Lakota people on a large reservation predominately spanning over parts of South Dakota and North Dakota. A series of wars occurred between the U.S. government and the Lakota people during the 1870s. Following the U.S. government's victory, in an attempt to further control the Lakota, the government split the Great Sioux Reservation into smaller reservations. In 1889 the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation was formed. A reservation census record shows that Black Hawk and his family lived in the Cherry Creek district of the reservation. Map showing territories of the Sioux Nation including Sans Arc tribe  Biographical Information  The earliest known record of Black Hawk dates to 1880 when he appears in a collection of census records. In 1868, Article 10 of the Treaty of Fort Laramie stipulated that extensive records of Indians be taken. Documents at the National Archives, Central Plans Region, in Kansas City show evidence of Black Hawk's existence throughout the 1880s. An annuity and goods disbursement record from September 1880 lists Black Hawk as a member of the Sans Arc band. In these same records, Black Hawk is said to have 4 family members. Based on the items that appear in the log (livestock, stove, bedstead) Black Hawk probably lived in a log cabin with his family. He is thought to have been married to a woman called Hollow Horn Woman and was a spiritual leader in his community. The titled of Black Hawk's ledger book given to it by William Edward Caton reads \\"CHIEF MEDICINE MAN OF THE SIOUX\\". The Sioux Nation is made up of many different groups so it is unlikely that Black Hawk was the chief medicine man for the entire population which at the time was around 35,000 to 50,000 people. However it is certain that Black Hawk was what would be known in the Lakota community as a Medicine Man. The scenes of cosmological visions and ritual that appear in Black Hawk's drawings are rare amongst Lakota art. His ledger book offers insight into the rituals Black Hawk would have performed as a medicine man of the Sans Arc Lakota. Black Hawk had at least one son who is on record as being born in 1862. These same records list Black Hawk's wife as a woman named Hollow Horn Woman. The name Hollow Horn dates back to a Lakota myth in which a woman brings a sacred pipe to chief Standing Hollow Horn and ensures prosperity for the Lakota. Black Hawk lived with his family in the southernmost part of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation known as the Cherry Creek District. The last record of Black Hawk at the Cheyenne River Reservation was in 1889. Nothing is known about Black Hawk's death but due to the last known date of his existence it is suspected that he died in the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890 on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.  Lakota Tradition and the Medicine Man  \\"The term medicine man is rather a simplisitic designation for a variety of ritual specialists\\". The creator of the Lakota universe is referred to as Wakan Tanka meaning \\"Great Spirit.\\" Lakota holy men are thought to have a greater connection to this force. \\"Lakota culture possessed a great wealth of rituals, both public and private, that permeated all aspects of life.\\" All animals are thought to be spiritual beings, though some are more wakan than others. The beasts that are especially wakan are buffalo, horses, elks, wolves, weasels, bears, mountain lions, prairie dogs, ferrets, foxes, beavers, and otters. The sacred pipe is the Lakota medicine man's direct connection to Wakan Tanka. Medicine men were thought to have been blessed with \\"holy vision\\" and it was common practice for them to share their vision with their fellow Lakota people. Individuals who had visions of the same wakan beings organized together forming societies of holy men, inducting new members when they had the appropriate vision. A vision quest was an essential part of being a successful holy man. There were many different ways to perform the vision quest but usually the vision quester utilized the sacred peace pipe and a sweat lodge. If the vision seeker was visited by a Thunder Being or Heyoka it was his duty to share the vision with his tribe or he was thought to have disrespected the Thunder Beings. It is evident by Black Hawk's drawing of the Dream or Vision of himself changed to a destroyer and riding a Buffalo Eagle that he was one of the holy few to be visited by a Thunder Being. Black Hawk, Black Elk, and Kills Two are the most referenced Lakota medicine men who left behind artwork.\\"When the Lakota seek knowledge about their state of affairs they seek it through the instructions imparted to the medicine man from animals, birds, and other animate and inanimate forms that serve as his helpers\\". In 1883, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior decreed that all traditional feats and ceremonies be outlawed as well as all practices of medicine men. Knowing that ritual practices were outlawed at time Black Hawk created his drawings gives us even further insight into his comprehensive account of Lakota life.  Ledger Drawings  The Indian Trader William Edward Canton commissioned Black Hawk to create a series of drawings during the winter of 1880-1881. According to Edith M. Teall, Canton's daughter, Canton offered Black Hawk 50 cents for every drawing he produced. This equated to a generous sum. In 1890 milk was around 14 cents and butter was around 25 cents. Thanks to his patron Black Hawk would have been able to survive the winter which was said to have been harsh. A statement by Caton's daughter and bound into the volume states that Black Hawk was a \\"Chief Medicine men\\" and \\"was in great straits\\" in the winter of 1880‚Äì1881 with \\"several squaws and numerous children dependent upon him.\\" It continues: \\"He had absolutely nothing, no food, and would not beg.\\" Black Hawk produced 76 drawings during the winter of 1880-1881 with the intention of selling them to Canton. The drawings were not meant to be presented in any order. They were originally done on regular foolscap paper measuring 13 x 16 and were cut down to their current size of 10 ¬º x 16 ¬Ω.\\" The materials Black Hawk used were a collection of what Canton had available. The sheets of paper have different water marks on them and are ruled using varying dimensions. Black Hawk drew most of the drawings using only pen, colored pencil, and ink. After Black Hawk gave Canton the drawings he arranged them and had them bound in Minneapolis using a hand-bookbinding technique still used by specialists today. The captions that are alongside the images are also Canton's contribution. Canton arranged the drawings to begin with the most powerful images. Black Hawk's drawings include seventeen warfare scenes, seventeen natural history scenes, and numerous drawings of Lakota ceremonies. Also included in his illustrations are Black Hawk's spiritual visions, and depictions of Lakota cosmology. While spirit quests were usually a solitary activity, Black Hawk's drawings serve to share his vision with other members of the community. Black Hawk's ledger book is unusual in the history of Lakota tourist art. According to scholarship on the subject it was very rare for a white man to commission a work of art. Typically the Lakota people created works with white buyers in mind and used their wares to trade for goods and services. The unique circumstances surrounding Black Hawk's creation of his 76 drawings suggest William Edward Canton's primary interest was helping Black Hawk and his family.  Scenes of Cosmology  There are two scenes depicting what is known as a Heyoka or a \\"Thunder Being\\" in Black Hawk's collection of drawings. A Thunder Being is a supernatural creature who appears to supplicants in vision quests. The \\"Thunder Beings\\" depicted in Black Hawk's book of drawings are a compilation of attributes from a horse, buffalo and eagle. Only a handful of drawings depicting Lakota religious experience remain today. When having the drawings bound Canton situated the two scenes of Lakota cosmology in the beginning of the book to signify their importance. He captioned the images \\"Dream or Vision of himself changed to a destroyer and riding a Buffalo Eagle\\" and \\"Same as first.\\" The caption informs us that Black Hawk intended to depict himself as a Thunder Being after a transformation he underwent during a vision quest. The rider and animal are unified by lines representing joint energy. The animals arms and legs are formed from eagle talons and it has buffalo horns on its head. The beast forms a rainbow with his tail. Additionally, spotting a rainbow was thought to signify the presence of a thunder being.  Scenes of Lakota Life and Ritual  Black Hawk, Drawing of Lakota Ceremony, colored pencil and pen on paper, 1880-1881Following Black Hawk's depiction of his vision of Thunder Beings is a succession of drawings depicting Lakota religious ceremonies. Catherine Berlo, the foremost scholar on Black Hawk, refers to the images depicting \\"buffalo transformation ceremonies\\" as representing the core of his spiritual vision. The buffalo transformation ceremony was carried out by members of a society of holy men known as \\"Buffalo Dreamers.\\" Similarly there were societies of Elk Dreamers, Deer Dreamers, and Wolf Dreamers. Black Hawk included drawings of all of these societies in his collection of drawings. The images show the members of the tribe dawning animal masks. These masks serve to begin the transformation process, allowing the wearer to become the animal and take on some of its power. To signal this transformation to the viewer Black Hawk gave the participants hooves instead of feet and shows animal tracks behind them. In addition to illustrating animal transformation ceremonies Black Hawk also included a two images that show female puberty ceremonies. During a woman's menstrual cycle she would be secluded to a tipi where, with the help of a medicine man, she would undergo the transformation to woman hood. Black Hawk's scenes of Lakota rituals and ceremonies are one of the best visual accounts still surviving today. In addition to scenes depicting private religious ceremonies Black Hawk also included scenes of daily Lakota life. The scenes include drawings of tribal counselors, acts of courtship, and dances. Black Hawk also drew scenes of life in the Sans Arc's neighboring tribe and rivals the Crow Indians. The Crow were known for having elaborate garments and being skilled warriors. Black Hawk depicts a gathering of Crow warriors in which each of the 25 men is uniquely dressed. Black Hawk is one of the only indigenous artists to depict an enemy tribe. Black Hawk's drawings also include several scenes of warfare. In many of the images a warrior armed with a gun is fighting against one armed with a traditional spear. These insights into the techniques of warfare during the late 19th century are invaluable for understanding Lakota history. Catherine Berlo has been able to determine through analyzing the figures war attire that Black Hawk probably belonged to a group of Lakota warriors known as the Miwatani Society recognizable by their red capes and feathers.  Scenes of Nature  20% of the drawings Black Hawk gave to Canton are scenes of natural history. In seventeen drawings Black Hawk depicts 49 individual animals and at least 15 different species. They include elk, mountain sheep, sandhill cranes, owls, bats, bears, pronghorn antelope, mountain lions, and porcupines. Black Hawk depicts the animals in an encyclopedic nature sometimes including images of both a male and female of the species. Animals are of great importance to Lakota life and religion. Archie Fire Lame Deer once described the Lakota relationship with animals by saying \\"all wild animals have power because Wakan Tanka dwells in all of them, even in a tiny ant. The white man has built a wall between himself and that power. To understand what the animals are telling us needs time and patience, and the white man never has time.\\" Perhaps in providing such a comprehensive account of the animals Black Hawk viewed on the Great Plains he was attempting to share some of their beauty and power with Canton.  Provenance  In 1993 the ledger book was discovered in a filing cabinet donated to Goodwill Industries. The organization was briefly caught in the middle of a dispute regarding what to do with the valuable artifact. Gayle Byrne, Director of Goodwill Industries reached out to leaders of the Oglala tribe and the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation for instruction regarding the provenance of the book. Questions of whether the organization was in violation of the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) were raised. Ultimately in 1994, the ledger book was sold in an auction by Sotheby's Fine American Indian Art division in New York for nearly four hundred thousand dollars and later that year became part of the Eugene and Clare Thaw Collection of American Indian Art of the Fenimore Art Museum where it remains today.  Legacy  Black Hawk's comprehensive account of Lakota life created at a time when the Lakota tradition had never been more threatened has endured over 100 years and remains relevant today. Many contemporary Native American artists look to the art of ledger books as inspiration for their work. Francis Yellow, a contemporary Lakota artist wrote a poem entitled Cetan Sapa Tatehila (Black Hawk's Love). In the poem Yellow writes \\"Cetan Sapa's love made real on paper across time beyond death with pencil and crayon and something that's moving unseen.\\" Black Hawk's ledger book is a helpful source for the ethnographic examination of Lakota culture.

Original rules Six contestants faced a board of 30 numbers and played three rounds, with each contestant choosing one number per round. Two numbers hid bonus prizes (most commonly 5,000 Hoosier Lottery scratch-off tickets and a trip sponsored by ATA Airlines), while the others hid cash amounts from $1,000 to $10,000 (the typical layout in the 1990s was ten $1000s, six $2000s, four $3,000s, two $4,000s, one each of $5000-$10,000, Doubler, Tickets). In the mid-1990s, a \\"Doubler\\" was hidden behind one square and would double the amount of the contestant's next pick. Contestants kept whatever cash and prizes they found; uncovering a bonus prize did not affect a contestant's cash total, but did allow him/her to choose again on that turn. Only the two highest scorers after the third round advanced to a playoff, with the other four being eliminated. The lower scorer of the two chose a number first; if the value behind it was not enough to put him/her in the lead, the high scorer won immediately. If it was, the high scorer then chose a number in an attempt to retake the lead and the contestant with the higher total advanced to the bonus round. If the scores were tied after both had chosen, additional rounds were played until the tie was broken. Bonus round Version 1 (1989‚Äì1990): The winning contestant is presented a board with four numbers. Behind each number are three green dollar signs and a red \\"no dollar sign\\" (called the \\"Stopper\\"). Picking the first dollar sign won the contestant $50,000. The contestant could then stop and take the $50,000 or risk it for a try at the second green dollar sign. Picking the second dollar sign earned the contestant $100,000. The contestant could then risk it by picking from the two remaining numbers; picking the third dollar sign won the contestant the $1,000,000 grand prize. Picking the Stopper symbol would lose the $50,000/$100,000 risked, but the contestant still keeps all money earned in the regular game as well as receiving a stack of free Hoosier Lottery scratch- off game tickets. Version 2 (1990‚Äì2000): Same as version 1, but the three green dollar signs were replaced by $50,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000 symbols. This meant that the contestant could now win $1,000,000 on the first selection. In the mid-1990s, the two smaller prizes were increased to $150,000 and $200,000. Also, the contestant was presented with a glass case of $100,000 cash that they could take and forget about the bonus round game (again, by hitting the red stop button to stop or green button to go on) or risk it for one of the bigger cash prizes. Again, picking the Stopper symbol (which was changed by this point to a matching exploding graphic like the cash prizes) lost all bonus round money but the contestant still kept whatever was earned in the regular game. It was also by this point that the contestant was presented his/her winnings with a big check; previously only those who won the $1,000,000 grand prize was presented with the big check at the end. Version 3 (2000‚Äì2005): The contestant with the highest dollar amount advanced to a Bonus Round with sixteen squares. The player could reveal cash or prizes with values far less than $1 million. That player would advance to the Hoosier Millionaire Hysteria episode at the end of the season, where a $1 million prize would be awarded. However, the Hysteria episode format was unrelated to the regular show: rather than unveiling dollar amounts, the Hysteria board had basketball goals which revealed two or three points, a turnover, or a foul. The player with the fewest points was eliminated from the tournament bracket. Eventually one person was left to win the million. 25th Anniversary Show To celebrate the show's 25th anniversary, a special episode featuring past winners and the original on-air team of Patrick, Hobbs and Lamont was filmed, but not aired on television, at the Indiana State Fair on August 16, 2014 and later uploaded to the Indiana Lottery's YouTube channel. The set was manually operated, with the hostess pulling up pull-cards (instead of turning trilons), and the host turned flip-cards with numbers to show the totals. The bonus round player had two stop signs; a red sign with the word \\"STOP\\" and a green sign with the word \\"GO.\\" Broadcast history The game show began on WTTV/WTTK (Channel 4/29) in Indianapolis/Bloomington/Kokomo.

Wayne *WNDU (16) - South Bend *WTWO (2) - Terre Haute *WFIE (14) - Evansville *WGBO (66) - Joliet, Illinois/Chicago/Gary *WDRB (41) - Louisville, Kentucky/New Albany/Jeffersonville With Marion-licensed WNDY (Channel 23) trying to establish itself in Indianapolis, and with the new ownership of Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George, the Lottery moved the show to that station in February 1996, resulting in a few changes in the statewide network; *WSBT (22) - South Bend *WFFT (55) - Ft. Wayne *WTHI (10) - Terre Haute *WTVW (7) - Evansville *WJYS (62) - Hammond/Chicago/Gary *WFTE (58) - Salem/Louisville/New Albany/Jeffersonville WLFI continued to carry the show in Lafayette, while the show moved in the Chicago market due to WGBO's conversion to an owned-and-operated station of the Spanish language Univision network. During the 1990s, the show was sponsored by Long John Silvers, with their logo on top of the main gameboard. In addition, the show would also spotlight a \\"Hoosier Lottery retailer of the week\\" at the end of the show; in the early 1990s they would also spotlight an \\"[Indiana] county of the week\\". Four years later, a new format called \\"The New Hoosier Millionaire\\" premiered in January 2000 and returned to WTTV. The budget was essentially cut, with the $1,000,000 grand prize available every 13 weeks instead of on every show. The set became a black room with contestant podiums and a game board. The lowest dollar amount on the regular game board was increased to $2,000. More changes to the statewide network occurred: *WPTA (21) - Ft. Wayne *WTSN-LP (41) - Evansville *WKEF (22) - Dayton, Ohio/Richmond In June 2003, a whole new format emerged, and Tribune Broadcasting took over productions with their purchase of WTTV/WTTK from Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2003 to form a station duopoly in Indianapolis. The new management forced out Mark Patrick and Barbara Hobbs. Cody Stark and Catt Sadler, who were part of WXIN's \\"Fox 59 Morning News\\", took over hosting duties, and the program immediately moved to the higher- rated station. WKEF (a Sinclair station and WTTV's sister station before the WTTV/WTTK sale) dropped the program with no other Dayton/Eastern Indiana station taking its place, while in the Chicago area, the program moved to PBS member station WYIN (Channel 56, Gary), one of the few times a lottery game show has aired over a public television station, and WEVV (Channel 44) aired the show in Evansville.Hoosier Millionaire (1989-2005) Ratings declined for two more years until Hoosier Millionaire's cancellation early in its sixteenth season in the fall of 2005.

Puddingstone Reservoir is a 250-acre (1 km¬≤) artificial lake northeast of the interchange between the Orange Freeway (State Route 57) and the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) in Los Angeles County, California, United States. Activities include fishing, swimming, sailing, wind surfing, and camping. Brackett Field, Raging Waters, and Fairplex (formerly the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds) are all adjacent to Puddingstone Reservoir, which is inside Bonelli Regional Park. In 1923, the County of Los Angeles Flood Control District purchased a large piece of land to construct a dam to hold back floodwaters from an area covering . Work on the Puddingstone Dam started in February, 1925 and was completed in January, 1928. In 1932, a road across the top of the dam was constructed, creating a more direct route between the Pacific Electric station in San Dimas and Pomona Blvd. in Pomona. It was a considerably more direct route south - travelers previously had to either go west through Covina or east through Ganesha Park in Pomona. Historically, Puddingstone Reservoir, besides acting as a flood control basin, also provided water to the local citrus growers. Water was pumped to a smaller reservoir further north, which was used for irrigation purposes. It was soon used for recreation as well, with fishing, boating, and swimming allowed along selected beach areas. Los Angeles County established Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park at the site. A swimming pool facility was constructed by the County in the area just north of the reservoir, but in the late 1970s or early 1980s, they leased the area to a private developer who constructed Raging Waters, a pioneering water-themed amusement park. Today, the road over the dam is still in use and is undergoing major upgrades. Following the construction of Raging Waters, the road was renamed Raging Waters Drive, and extends from the entrance to the park on the south, to Puddingstone Drive on the north. The original portion of the road's right of way to Pomona was developed as part of the Orange Freeway (State Route 57).San Dimas Historical SocietyImages of America/SAN DIMAS Copyright (c) Paul Rippens and the San Dimas Historical Society The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in the Puddingstone Reservoir due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs.  History  * The earliest evidence of water in the semiarid rolling hills of what is now the eastern portion of the San Gabriel Valley at Mud Springs, North of today's Puddingstone Dam. Indians, explorers and adventurers probably took water from mud springs during times when sheep and cattle grazed across the land. Later, soldiers and stagecoach drivers were among those who stopped at the historical site. The adobe at the north edge puddingstone reservoir was built in 1882 before citrus orchards appeared in the San Jose hills area. * Concern for the water grew with the increasing number of settlements in East San Gabriel Valley and the need for water storage receptacles became apparent. * In 1923, the County of Los Angeles Flood Control District purchased a large piece of land to construct a dam to hold back floodwaters from an area covering 30.3 square miles (78 km2). Work on the Puddingstone Dam started in February, 1925 and was completed in January, 1928. * When completed in 1928 at a cost of one million dollars, the dam was originally built as a flood control facility to impound storm run-off and replenish underground water supplies. * The dam created a 250-acre lake. In 1931 the Department of Recreation Camps, and Playgrounds (which later became Department of Parks and Recreation) assigned lifeguards to protect those involved in the newly allowed fishing and swimming activities. * In 1932, a road across the top of the dam was constructed, creating a more direct route between the Pacific Electric station in San Dimas and Pomona Blvd. in Pomona. It was a considerably more direct route south - travelers previously had to either go west through Covina or east through Ganesha Park in Pomona. * In 1948 a parking lot was installed through the County Department of Parks and Recreation. * In 1950 the county board of supervisors instructed the county administrative officer and the County Department of Recreation to report on possible development of the Puddingstone Area for recreational purposes. * In 1953 the 150-acre Puddingstone Reservoir was designated as a \\"Recreational and Fishing Area\\". It was stocked with fish by the state fish and game commission. * By 1958, arrangements had been made to allow the county to purchase extra water for the lake. Built as a flood control facility, the lake was subject to fluctuations and now the county was able to maintain a constant-level lake. This was a big step to opening the reservoir for full recreation. The land for Frank G. Bonelli Park was assembled by various lease agreements, land grant deeds, condemnation actions and private interests to eventually compromise nearly 2,000 acres. * In 1959 a drive spearheaded by supervisor Frank G. Bonelli, the county department of parks and recreation assumed responsibility for the Puddingstone area. This year the first patrol boat appeared on the lake and the boat house was constructed. * Mass planting of more than 10,000 trees in the northeast section was begun by volunteers of 50 civic groups from 14 cities and communities in East San Gabriel Valley area. * Water skiing was initiated along the east shoreline of the 200 acre water surface. * In 1963 the county leased for operation and maintenance the 18-hole Mountain Meadows golf course from Pomona Golf and country club. The course opened in 1921 as a private course, was formerly called Mountain Meadows Golf Club. * In 1970 a forty-year joint powers agreement was entered into the county of Los Angeles and cities Covina, Glendora, Pomona, La Verne, San Dimas, and Walnut. The agreement established the Los Angeles County Puddingstone Reservoir Regional Park Authority (Now Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park Authority). * Los Angeles County was now responsible for financing and improving the facility. The authority had the power to sell revenue bonds to finance the total construction for the park. In support of the project, the state legislature authorized the transfer of the state property to the county in fee title. * By 1972 development had been completed on the north shore and included a swim park (now Raging Waters) a powerboat launching facility, and group picnic area. * By 1976 the south shore consisted of sailboat launching facilities, picnic valley and east shore fishing areas. Mountain Meadows Golf Course was renovated and equestrian facilities were constructed. The recreational vehicle park was also opened in 1976. * In 1986 the Puddingstone Hot Tubs were opened.  Activities  Activities include fishing, swimming, sailing, jet skiing, and wind surfing. There is a launching area for boats on the north shore.

The former SR specialist unit was transferred to Nidec's Drive Systems subsidiary in 2016, but was much reduced in size and scope in 2019 when Nidec ended all manufacturing at the Harrogate site and greatly downsized the (until then) substantial engineering team. Nidec Drive Systems continues to supply SR motors and inverters, but presently only for customer-specific industrial and off-road vehicle applications.

The order is closely tied to the Ba'Alawi sadah family. It was founded by al-Faqih Muqaddam As-Sayyid Muhammad bin Ali Ba'Alawi al-Husaini, who died in the year 653 AH (1232 CE). He received his ijazah from Abu Madyan in Morocco via two of his students.Anne K. Bang, Sufis and Scholars of the Sea: Family Networks in East Africa, 1860‚Äì1925, Routledge, 2003, pg 13 Abu Madyan was a student of Abdul Qadir Jilani, as well as one of the shaikhs in the Shadhiliya tariqa chain of spiritual transmitters from Muhammad. The members of this Sufi way are mainly sayyids whose ancestors hail from the valley of Hadramaut, in the southern part of Yemen, although it is not limited to them. The chain of ijazah of spiritual Sufi transmission from al-Faqih Muqaddam Sayyid Muhammad traces back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad via his cousin Ali and from him, his son Husain. The Origin The name Ba'Alawi itself is a Hadhrami contraction of the terms Bani 'Alawi or the Clan of 'Alawi. In the early 4th Century Hijri at 318 H, Sayyid Ahmad al-Muhaajir bin Isa ar-Rumi bin Muhammad al-Naqib bin Ali al-Uraidhi ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq migrated from Basrah, Iraq first to Mecca and Medina, and then to Hadhramout, to avoid the chaos then prevalent in the Abbassid Caliphate, where descendants of Muhammad were continuously being suspected of arson and revolt against the caliph. Most descendants of Muhammad known as sayyids enjoyed much followings due to their steep knowledge in Islam and its teachings, both esoteric and exoteric. Although such personalities may not have political ambitions, having huge followings means that they always attract the suspicions of the caliphate. The name 'Alawi refers to the grandson of Sayyid Ahmad al-Muhajir, who was the first descendant of Husain, Muhammad's grandson, to be born in Hadramaut and the first to bear such a name. Thus all the 'Alawi sayyids of Hadramaut are his progeny, and his descendants has since spread far and wide to the Arabian Peninsula, India especially in the Southern state of Kerala along the Malabar Coasts, North and West Coast of Africa ( the Islamic Maghreb ) , and the countries of the Malay Archipelago ) Malaysia and Indonesia ) spreading Sunni Islam of the Shafii school and the Ba'Alawi Tariqah brand of Sufism. Ba 'Alawiyya Sufi order, according to historians, is linked to Madyaniyya Sufi order. It is also influenced by Qadiriyya, all because the founder, Muhammad al-Faqih al-Muqaddam received the spiritual transmissions from them. Hadhramaut during his life was torn by constant tribal fights. al- Muqaddam advised the descendants of the Sayyid to abandon arms and wars and instead to pursue religious and moral values. As the founding father of the Sufism in Hadhramaut, he received the title of the Qutb al-Irshad wa Ghausil al-'Ibad Wa al-Bilad () of the Ba 'Alawiyya Sufi order, which is the highest rank in Sufism (see also Abdal). Initially, the followers of Ba 'Alawiyya functioned secretly for about five centuries. Doctrines Like many other Sufi orders, Ba 'Alawi order supports the doctrine of outward (zahir) and inward (batin). The outward aspect of this tariqa consists of pursuing religious sciences and ritual practices while its inward aspect is the attainment of Sufi stations (maqamat) and states (ahwal). The virtues of the order is that its adherents never disclose their secrets (sawn al-asrar) and they preserve them from uninitiated. The outward aspect follows Al-Ghazali's practices as described in his Ihya Ulum al-Deen, while the inward aspect is similar to Shadhiliyya Sufi order.https://web.archive.org/web/20111209102407/http://tariqa.sites.uol.com.br/ The basic doctrine of Ba 'Alawiyya is the purification of heart through saintly life. Even Though it is a Sufism and an offshoot of Qadiriyya, but it does not have Khalwah (seclusion for purposes of spiritual exercise) and does not renounce worldly activities. It also emphasizes the teaching and practicing Akhlaq as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad. Imam Ahmad bin Isa al-Muhajir and his son, according to majority of historians, spread the legal school of Shafi'i and Ash'ari for theology. A few historians had pointed out that Ba 'Alawis incline to Shiism because many of the Shiites had followed some of the order of Ba Alawis in certain regions R.B. Serjeant summarizes the main points of Ba 'Alawiyya tariqa: The Sayyids affirm it is the best Tariqa based on al-Qur'an and Sunnah and the beliefs of pious ancestors (al-Aslaf Shalihin), but act with humility, piety and lofty motive. The follower must love obscurity, dislike manifestation, withdraw from madding crowd, but he still has to warn and advice in matters of religious duty. He must also show kindness to his family, relatives, neighbors, friends, acquaintances, tribes and to all other Muslims. The tradition was transmitted orally in its first generation, so no books were written. Later on, transmission through writing became more important to clarify some obscurity. Books such as al-Burqa, al- Ma'arij, al-Kibrit al-Ahmar, al-Juz al-Latif were then written to preserve the gradual disappearance of the tariqa. The tariqa also teaches the adherents to give da'wah and disseminate Islam peacefully without violence. This explains why Islam could have spread easily in South East Asian countries and was accepted by the indigenous people, where the followers brought Islam peacefully and mostly through trading and marriage (this because the men did not bring their wives abroad). Ba 'Alawiyya followers also practice other outward-aspect traditions not taught in Ihya Ulum al-Deen. For example, it is common for the Ba 'Alawiyya followers in the past, mainly in Hadhramaut and Malay Archipelago, to perform Taqbil, especially to respected Habibs. Annual spiritual activities such as Mawlid, Khaul (anniversary commemoration of the death of a family member or to highly respected persons in the community), or practices performed routinely such as Majlis Dhikr (Dhikr assemblies, usually by reciting or such as Wird al-Latif or Ratib by Habib Abdullah bin Alwi al- Haddad after every Fajr and Maghrib time), Tahlil (another form of Dhikr assembly, but usually is performed if somebody dies), Reading of classical Islamic books, and Ziyarat are practices followed by Ba 'Alawiyya. During these events it is not uncommon to see Ha·∏çras and Qasidas also recited and sometimes accompanied with Rebanas. Some of the above practices (such as mawlid or qasida) even performed in wedding ceremonies by Ba 'Alawi communities. The influences of Ba 'Alawi tariqa can be found also in a few large Islamic organizations. For example, the rituals performed by members of Nahdlatul Ulama such as Tahlil, mawlid or ziyarat are all influenced by and can be traced back to the Ba 'Alawiyya teachings, where Hadhrami of Ba 'Alawiyya migrated and taught the tariqa in Java since 18th centuries. Some of the prominent figures of this tariqa are: * al-Qutb al-Ghawth al-Imam Muhammad al-Faqih al-Muqaddam * al-Habib Qutb Abu Bakr al-Aydarus al-'Adeni * The Wali Qutb al-Ghawth al-Habib Abdullah ibn Alawi al-Haddad * al-Habib Ahmad bin Zayn al-Habshi * Sayyid Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki * Habib Umar bin Hafiz * Habib Ali Al-Jifri In Hadhramaut, the teaching of this tariqa is done in several Ribath, such as Ribath Tarim or at Dar al-Mustafa founded by Habib Umar bin Hafiz.

She studied properties of semiconductors and organic conductors, especially electron transport. Conwell is best known for the Conwell-Weisskopf theory which elucidates how electrons travel through semiconductors, an accomplishment that helped revolutionize modern computing. In 1990, Conwell became an adjunct professor at the University of Rochester while still working at Xerox. In 1998, Conwell joined the University of Rochester faculty full-time as a professor of chemistry where she focused on the flow of electrons through DNA. Conwell has earned four patents, published more than 270 papers, and multiple textbooks over her career. Her textbook High Field Transport in Semiconductors became the authoritative text in the field. Education Conwell obtained a physics B.A. from Brooklyn College in 1942. She then went to the University of Rochester to complete a M.S. in physics in 1945 with Victor Weisskopf. She initially planned to do a Ph.D. at Rochester, but since her adviser left to work at Los Alamos after her first year there, she completed her masters and obtained a Ph.D. at a later point in time. Conwell collaborated with Karl Lark-Horovitz and Vivian Johnson at Purdue University on silicon and germanium semiconductor physics. Her masters was initially classified then finally declassified in 1945 and subsequently her M.S. was awarded in which she determined the Conwell-Weisskopf theory. Conwell received her physics Ph.D. in 1948, from the University of Chicago under the advisement of Nobel Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar at Yerkes Observatory and was also an assistant to Enrico Fermi. She was a teaching assistant at Chicago and graded the work of Nobel Laureates such as Chen-Ning Yang and Owen Chamberlain. Career After her first year of graduate school, she was employed by Western Electric as an assistant engineer. At the time, payroll did not have a job title code for female assistant engineers so her title was changed to engineers assistant and her pay reduced to fit an existing code. She was an instructor in physics at Brooklyn College (1946‚Äì1951). She then worked as a researcher at Bell Laboratories (1951‚Äì1952) where she studied with William Shockley on the effects of high electric fields on electron transport in semiconductors. She then became a staff member at Sylvania which was then taken over by GTE Laboratories (1952‚Äì1972). In 1972 she joined the Xerox Wilson Research Center, where she was a Research Fellow from 1981 to 1998. At Xerox, she investigated transport and optical properties of doped polymers such as those used for photoreceptors in copiers. Conwell was the Associate Director of the NSF Center for Photoinduced Charge Transfer at University of Rochester starting in 1991. She spent a year as a visiting professor at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1962 and a semester as the Abby Rockefeller Mauz√© Professor at MIT in 1972. Honors and awards Conwell was made a fellow of the IEEE in 1980 ‚Äúfor contributions to semiconductor theory, particularly transport in both low and high electric fields.‚Äù She was also a fellow of the American Physical Society. She is one of the few who have the triple membership in the National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1992) and is the only member of the University of Rochester to achieve this. She had received the Achievement Award of the Society of Women Engineers (1960) and an Honorary D.Sc. from Brooklyn College in 1992. In 1997 she received the IEEE Edison Medal for \\"fundamental contributions to transport theory in semiconductor and organic conductors, and their application to the semiconductor, electronic copying and printing industries.\\" She was the first woman to win this award. Other notable awardees include Alexander Graham Bell, Vannevar Bush, and Michael Pupin. In November 2002, Discover magazine listed Conwell as one of the 50 most important women scientists at the time. In 2004 she received a Dreyfus Senior Faculty Mentor Award for serving as a research mentor to undergraduates. In 2006, the University of Rochester honored Conwell with a Susan B. Anthony Lifetime Achievement Award for her efforts in advocating and promoting women in science. The ACS Award for Encouraging Women into Careers in the Chemical Sciences was awarded to her in 2008. In 2010, Conwell received the prestigious National Medal of Science from President Barack Obama, for \\"her broad contributions to understanding electron and hole transport in semiconducting materials, which helped to enable commercial applications of semiconductor and organic electronic devices, and for extending her analysis to studying the electronic properties of DNA.\\" She was nominated by Mildred Dresselhaus, a professor of physics and electrical engineering at MIT and a National Medals of Science winner. Personal life Ester Conwell was born in 1922 in New York City. She had two sisters and both of her parents were immigrants. Her son, Lewis Rothberg, is also a tenured professor of Physics, Physical Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering at the University of Rochester; his research focuses on organic electronics and biomolecular sensing using laser energetics. On November 16, 2014, Conwell was walking when she was struck by her neighbor's car as he was backing out of his driveway. Capt. David Catholdi of the Brighton Police Department stated that alcohol and speed were not factors in the incident. She was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital, where she died from her injuries several hours later. She was 92 years old and was still actively pursuing research.

The club was based in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, and was nicknamed the Penguins. After suffering financial hardship throughout the 1950s, Brighton moved to Caulfield and later became the Caulfield Bears in the early to mid-1960s. History The club is believed to have been formed in 1885 and seven years later became a foundation member of the Metropolitan Junior Football Association. They won a premiership in 1903 during their sixteen years in the league and in 1908 joined the VFA as one of the teams to replace Richmond, who had shifted to the Victorian Football League (VFL), and West Melbourne, who had merged with North Melbourne in a failed attempt to do the same. During this time, Brighton played its home matches at the Brighton Beach Oval, before shifting to Elsternwick Park in 1927. Brighton first played finals football in the VFA in 1926 with help from former Fitzroy player Gordon Rattray who coached the club. They made it all the way to the grand final before losing to Coburg, the club that would beat them again in the grand final the following season. They were runners-up in 1938. A player of the 1940s. Brighton almost folded while the Association was in recess during World War II, but was able to compile a committee and resume playing in 1945 when the Association resumed. Four years later, in 1948, the club won its first and only top division premiership. Under the coaching of Col Williamson, they had finished the home and away season in third place and after defeating Brunswick in the preliminary final they qualified for the decider against Williamstown, whom they downed by nine points. The club was one of several which struggled badly both on and off the field after the throw-pass era ended in 1950. In twelve seasons from 1952 until 1963, the club won eight wooden spoons, including the first three Division 2 wooden spoons in 1961 until 1963. The club had a very low supporter base, a very small group of committeemen who were increasingly unable to manage all of the administrative work, it struggled to retain players, and in some seasons it had to operate as an amateur club due to lack of money. Coupled with its existing off-field problems, the club lost occupancy of its home ground at Elsternwick Park after the 1961 season. The club managed to survive, after merging with the Federal League's South Caulfield Football Club to form a new team known as Brighton- Caulfield. The merger did not help the club's on-field performances, and its first two seasons as a merged club yielded wooden spoons. The club's on-field performance briefly improved in 1964, when the club recruited a core of twelve senior players from defending Division 1 premier Moorabbin after that club's sudden expulsion from the Association just before the season. After competing as Brighton-Caulfield for three seasons, the club eliminated almost all links to its Brighton heritage in 1965 as the club sought to appeal more strongly to fans in its new suburb. The name was shortened to Caulfield, the Penguin emblem was replaced with a Bear, and the club's colours were changed from maroon and gold to blue and white ‚Äìeffectively bringing an end to the Brighton Football Club's existence‚Äì. The club competed in the Association as the Caulfield Football Club until the end of the 1987 season.

The show was hosted by Roseanne Barr at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and this would be the last time there was a female host for the VMAs until Chelsea Handler hosted in 2010. Kurt Cobain, frontman of grunge band Nirvana, was honored this night after his death on April 5. Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley opened the show by Michael giving a speech. They ended it by taking a long kiss in front of everyone. In another notable moment, David Letterman escorted Madonna onto the stage and told the singer to watch her language, poking fun at Madonna's controversial appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman five months earlier. R.E.M. was, for the second time in their careers, the biggest winner of the night, taking home four technical awards for their video \\"Everybody Hurts.\\" Closely following were hip-hop group Salt-n-Pepa and rock band Aerosmith, both of which earned three moonmen that night. Aerosmith's video for Cryin', in fact, won the two main awards of the night, Video of the Year and Viewer's Choice, making it the second video in VMA history to achieve this feat. This would also be the last time that the nominees for Viewer's Choice were the same as those for Video of the Year, as MTV discontinued this rule the next year. In terms of nominations, meanwhile, Aerosmith was the night's biggest nominee, earning a total of nine nominations for two of their videos: \\"Cryin'\\" received four general nominations, while \\"Amazing\\" earned five professional ones. Right behind them were R.E.M., whose video for \\"Everybody Hurts\\" was the night's most nominated video with seven nominations, and newcomer Bj√∂rk, who received six nominations for \\"Human Behaviour.\\" Winners and nominations Winners are in bold text.

An example might be smiling inducing an involuntary contraction of the eye muscles, causing a person to squint when smiling. Facial and extraocular muscles are affected most often; in rare cases, a person's hands might perform mirror movements. Synkinesis is usually caused by dysfunction of a particular nerve. Potential causes include improper healing after nerve trauma or neurodegeneration, as occurs in Parkinson's disease. In congenital cases, mutations of genes involved in nerve growth, specifically axonal growth have been found. Rarely, it occurs as part of syndromes with neuroendocrine problems, such as Kallman syndrome. The prognosis is usually good with normal intelligence and lifespan. Treatment depends on the cause, but is largely conservative with facial retraining or mime therapy, if needed, while Botox and surgery are used as last resort. Types Most cases involve the cranial nerves, which innervate many small cranial muscles, such as the facial muscles and the extraocular muscles. This is in contrast to areas of body where miswiring of the larger muscles is less evident due to the size of the muscles. Synkinesis can also involve the upper limbs, especially hands which is quite rare, at 1 case in 1 million. In some cases, nerves improperly regenerate into glands, such as lacrimal glands, leading to a condition known as crocodile tears or Bogorad's syndrome. Facial synkinesis Facial synkinesis is a common sequela to Idiopathic Facial Nerve Paralysis, also called Bell's Palsy or Facial Palsy. Bell's Palsy, which is thought to occur due to a viral reactivation which can lead (through unknown mechanisms) to diffuse axon demyelination and degeneration of the seventh cranial nerve, results in a hemifacial paralysis due to non-functionality of the nerve. As the nerve attempts to recover, nerve miswiring results (see Mechanism of Action below). In patients with severe facial nerve paralysis, facial synkinesis frequently develops. Additionally, a common treatment option for facial palsy is to use electrical stimulation. Unfortunately, this has been shown to be disruptive to normal re-innervation and can promote the development of synkinesis. The most common symptoms of facial synkinesis include: *Eye closure with volitional contraction of mouth muscles *Midfacial movements with volitional eye closure *Neck tightness (Platysmal contraction) with volitional smiling *Hyperlacrimation (also called Crocodile Tears) **A case where eating provokes excessive lacrimation. This has been attributed to neural interaction between the salivary glands and the lacrimal glands. Extra-ocular muscle synkinesis The six muscles around the eye (extraocular muscles) are innervated by three different cranial nerves: Abducens (6th nerve), Trochlear (4th nerve), and Oculomotor (3rd nerve). After nerve trauma around the eye, a combination of any two of these three cranial nerves have been shown to be involved with extra-ocular synkinesis. Moreover, while the abducens and the trochlear nerve each innervate one specific muscle, the oculomotor nerve has many functions including eyelid retraction and pupil constriction. Thus, during synkinesis, one of these functions may be involved. Examples include: * On attempted abduction of an affected eye, the eye adducts and the eyelid retracts. **This is an interaction between the abducens nerve and a branch of the oculomotor nerve. Voluntary activation of the abducens nerve (eye abduction) causes involuntary activation of the oculomotor nerve (eye adduction and eyelid elevation). * On attempted abduction, the eye's unreactive pupil constricts **Another interaction, yet different, is between eye abduction (abducens nerve) and pupil constriction (the oculomotor nerve). * On attempted adduction with eye depression, the eyelid retracts. **In this case voluntary activation of the trochlear nerve (eye depression + eye abduction) is involuntarily activating a branch of the oculomotor nerve responsible for eyelid retraction. *Focusing to the near (accommodation) is accompanied by involuntary convergence of the eyes. This accommodation- convergence synkinesis can result in esotropia, or eyes that turn in when the ratio between accommodation and convergence is unusually high. Other less common variations of synkinesis involving the cranial nerves include: *Trigeminal-Abducens Synkinesis **After physical trauma to the skull, the muscle involved in eye abduction can become reinnervated by the branch of the trigeminal nerve involved in innervating the muscles of mastication(chewing muscles). Thus, involuntary abduction of an involved eye will occur upon eating or chewing. *Trigeminal-Facial Synkinesis **After surgical trauma, the muscles of mastication can become reinnervated by the facial nerve as opposed to the trigeminal nerve. This causes weakness in voluntary chewing; also, facial movements such as blinking cause the muscles to contract. Bimanual Synkinesis Bimanual Synkinesis occurs when left and right upper limbs, especially the hands and fingers execute exactly the same movement even though only one hand is intentionally moved. It is also called \\"mirror hand movements\\" and persists throughout life. When it occurs by itself without other associated signs and symptoms it is associated with normal intelligence and lifespan. It can also develop in the course of Parkinson's disease.congenital mirror movement disorder April 2015 Genetics Home Reference, National Library of Medicine, accessed June 27, 2017 In association with other abnormalities, mirror hand movements are a hallmark of Kallmann syndrome. Genetic mutations associated with (congenital) mirror hand movements are in the DCC (gene) or RAD51 gene, which account for about 35 percent of cases. In DCC mutation, impaired or missing netrin 1 receptor protein impairs control of axon growth during nervous system development. Causes Almost all cases of synkinesis develop as a sequel to nerve trauma. (The exception is when it is congenitally acquired as in Duane-Retraction Syndrome and Marcus Gunn phenomenon.) Trauma to the nerve can be induced in cases such as surgical procedures, nerve inflammation, neuroma, and physical injury. Mechanism There are three proposed mechanisms for synkinesis: aberrant nerve regeneration, interneuronal ephaptic transmission, and nuclear hyperexcitability. Aberrant nerve regeneration The aberrant nerve regeneration hypothesis is the most widely accepted mechanism for synkinesis. The hypothesis states that, after trauma, axons project from the facial nucleus to incorrect peripheral muscle groups. These aberrant branches can simultaneously innervate different subdivisions of the facial nerve. For example: compression to the facial nerve causes a lesion and the set of axons that innervates the orbicularis oris (mouth muscle) degenerate. Once the compression has relieved, regeneration of axons from the lesion site begins. This time though, only 50% of the set of axons that innervate the orbicularis oris successfully reinnervate the original site. The other half aberrantly branched off and innervated the orbicularis oculi(eye muscle). Thus, when the patient purses their lips, the ipsilateral eye will squint. The hypothesis assumes that disorganized regeneration occurs at the site of the lesion. On the contrary, recent research by Choi and Raisman has provided a more thorough understanding of synkinesis through aberrant axonal regeneration. Their study has shown that regenerating axons become disorganized throughout the length of the nerve and not only at the site of the lesion. Previously, many developed treatment strategies (that inevitably failed) were invented based on the original hypothesis by only focusing on the lesion site for improving the organization of regeneration. The new modification to the hypothesis could allow for better success in developing treatments. Ephaptic transmission Ephaptic transmission is when two nerves communicate with each other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An analogy for this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to ‚Äúcross-talk‚Äù and send action potentials in both directions. Nuclear hyperexcitability The basis of this hypothesis is as follows: after a lesion, axonal degeneration (via Wallerian degeneration) occurs. The post-synaptic cell consequently becomes deprived of input and becomes more sensitive to neurotransmitters (e.g. creating additional receptors). Subsequently, nearby residual undamaged axons can provide a source of neurotransmitter to the deprived post-synaptic cell. Since the post-synaptic cell is hypersensitive, the neurotransmitters that reach it from an axon of another nerve will successfully provide stimulation. This consequently creates undesired peripheral movement (i.e. synkinesis). *Since synkinesis has been reported in patients within 1‚Äì2 months, the nuclear hyper-excitability hypothesis is being supported by more researchers. Furthermore, axonal regeneration is a slow process (~1 mm/day growth) and regeneration at this rate of the facial nerve would roughly take 4‚Äì8 months. Since synkinesis is observed much earlier, aberrant regeneration and ephaptic communication fail to explain for this observation thus providing evidence that nuclear hyper-excitability is an important factor in the mechanism of synkinesis development. Although these three mechanisms have been argued for and against in various ways, it has become more accepted that synkinesis develops through a combination of these mechanisms. Diagnosis=Measurement Until May 2007, there was no clinical scale to measure synkinesis. A study led by Mehta et al. has validated the use of a newly designed instrument to evaluate facial synkinesis called the Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ). The instrument, consisting of nine questions, was found to be both reliable and valid. In addition, it is simple, easy to administer, and inexpensive. Its analyses can allow for treatment options to be evaluated. Treatment Experimental research for treatment has been mostly focused on facial synkinesis due to its abundant prevalence compared to extra-ocular synkinesis. Additionally, since the extra-ocular muscles are hidden within the orbits, there is a limit on the type of practical treatments that can be established (e.g. massage). Treatments for synkinesis in general include facial retraining, biofeedback, mime therapy, and Botox and surgery, as a last resort. Facial retraining Facial retraining therapy builds upon the idea that neurons are constantly in a dynamic state. In other words, there is constant growth and regression of neuronal projections dependent on the stimuli produced. To reduce synkinesis, facial retraining teaches the patient techniques for increasing wanted movements while focusing on restricting unwanted movement. If, for example, the mouth moves whenever the eyes blink voluntarily, facial retraining techniques will teach the patient to slowly close the eyes while actively focusing on keeping the mouth muscles still. Facial retraining has shown to be very successful with almost a 60-70% average decrease in synkinesis reported after 7 months. Biofeedback Biofeedback therapy for facial synkinesis aims to increase the patient's awareness of the facial muscle posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors (used for proprioceptive feedback) and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for proprioceptive feedback). Thus, biofeedback allows the patient to actively sense the motion of their muscles. The two common forms of biofeedback used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from facial muscle sites displayed to the patient from a computer in the form of waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction. The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction. Biofeedback is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness. A study by Nakamura et al. has shown that biofeedback works better for prevention of synkinesis as opposed to treatment of synkinesis. Due to the extreme efforts needed to achieve improvements during synkinesis, Nakamura et al. observed that patients will often fail to reach their desired goal because of the difficulty of maintaining motivation during training. The desired course of action is to catch the patient shortly after facial nerve trauma and teach the patient biofeedback techniques. This course of action has been experimentally proven to significantly reduce the development of synkinesis. Mime therapy Mime therapy was introduced in the Netherlands in 1980. It was initially designed to treat facial palsy by improving symmetry of the face both at rest and during movement. It was then later observed that people who had post-facial palsy synkinesis also benefited from this therapy. It wasn't until 2003 that Beurskens and Heymans were able to experimentally conclude that mime therapy was indeed a good treatment choice for synkinesis. Furthermore, later studies by Beurskens et al. have shown that benefits obtained from mime therapy are stable one year after therapy. Current mime therapy consists of a combination of procedures designed to promote symmetry of the face at rest and during movement to control synkinesis. The components include: massage, stretching exercises, exercises to coordinate both halves of the face, etc. The overall aim of mime therapy is to develop a conscious connection between the use of facial muscles and emotional expression. While facial retraining therapy is more focused on treating slight synkinetic movements, mime therapy aims to increase the overall vigor of the muscles through active exercises, while in the process of doing so, teaching the face to decrease unwanted synkinetic movements. Botox Botox (botulinum toxin) is a new and versatile tool for the treatment of synkinesis. Initially used for reducing hyperkinesis after facial palsy, Botox was later attempted on patients with post-facial palsy synkinesis to reduce unwanted movements. The effects of Botox have shown to be remarkable, with synkinetic symptoms disappearing within 2 or 3 days. The most common treatment targets are the orbicularis oculi, depressor anguli oris (DAO), mentalis, platysma and the contralateral depressor labii inferioris muscles. Due to the short span of Botox effects though, patients must come back to the doctor for re-injection approximately every 3 months. More notable is that in a majority of patients, various synkinetic movements completely disappeared after 2-3 sessions of trimonthly Botox injections. A more specific synkinesis, crocodile tears syndrome (hyperlacrimation upon eating), has been shown to respond exceedingly well to Botox injection. Botox is injected directly into the lacrimal gland and has shown to reduce hyperlacrimation within 24‚Äì48 hours. The procedure was shown to be simple and safe with very little chance of side-effects (although on rare occasions ptosis can occur due to botulinum toxin diffusion). Furthermore, reduction in hyper-lacrimation was shown to last longer than the expected 3 months (about 12 months). Since Botox can mimic facial paralysis, an optimized dose has been determined that reduces involuntary synkinesis of the muscle while not affecting muscle tone. Surgery Practical surgical procedures used for treating synkinesis are neurolysis and selective myectomy. Neurolysis has been shown to be effective in relieving synkinesis but only temporarily and unfortunately symptoms return much worse than originally. Selective myectomy, in which a synkinetic muscle is selectively resected, is a much more effective technique that can provide permanent relief and results in a low recurrence rate; unfortunately, it also has many post-operative complications that can accompany including edema, hematoma, and ecchymosis. Therefore, surgical procedures are very minimally used by doctors and are used only as last-resort options for patients who do not respond well to non- invasive treatments.

Toledo Mud Hens In , Maguire got his first taste of minor league baseball, playing for the Toledo Mud Hens. He was Toledo's starting second baseman for four seasons, finishing up with a .326 average in . This earned him another shot at the majors with the Cubs. Chicago Cubs During the previous offseason, Chicago had traded their starting third baseman, Sparky Adams, to the Pittsburgh Pirates along with outfielder Pete Scott for outfielder Kiki Cuyler. They shifted second baseman Clyde Beck over to third and installed Maguire as their starter at second. Things started off with a bang, as Maguire hit his first Major League home run on Opening Day off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Dolf Luque. It was the only run the Cubs scored that day in a 5‚Äì1 loss.Cubs vs. Reds box score, Opening Day 1928 Although he did not hit another home run‚Äîand indeed would not hit another during the rest of his Major League career‚ÄîMaguire did have an excellent year with the glove.

That offseason, though, Maguire was one of five players traded to the Braves for superstar Rogers Hornsby. Boston Braves Replacing Hornsby was a difficult task, and Maguire slumped in for the cellar- dwelling Braves, as his numbers slipped both offensively and defensively. His offensive numbers were so poor, he was what has occasionally been called a \\"Triple Crown loser\\", finishing last among qualifiers for the batting title in all three Triple Crown statistics (batting average, home runs, runs batted in). Things did not improve much from there. Although Maguire had an uptick in average and RBI in , in he finished last in all three categories again, the only player in MLB history to have done so more than once. He was let go after the season. Return to the minor leagues In , Maguire signed with the Louisville Colonels, splitting the season between that team and the Toronto Maple Leafs.

The Assyrians perfected early techniques of imperial rule, many of which became standard in later empires. The Assyrians were the first to be armed with iron weapons, and their troops employed advanced, effective military tactics. Following the conquests of Adad-nirari II in the late 10th century BC, Assyria emerged as the most powerful state in the world at the time, coming to dominate the Ancient Near East, East Mediterranean, Asia Minor, Caucasus, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa, eclipsing and conquering rivals such as Babylonia, Elam, Persia, Urartu, Lydia, the Medes, Phrygians, Cimmerians, Israel, Judah, Phoenicia, Chaldea, Canaan, the Kushite Empire, the Arabs, and Egypt.Tadmor, H. (1994). The Inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III, King of Assyria, p.29 The Neo-Assyrian Empire succeeded the Old Assyrian Empire (c. 2025‚Äì1378 BC), and the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365‚Äì934 BC) of the Late Bronze Age. During this period, Aramaic was also made an official language of the empire, alongside Akkadian. Upon the death of Ashurbanipal in 631 BC, the empire began to disintegrate due to a brutal and unremitting series of civil wars in Assyria proper. In 616 BC, Cyaxares, king of the Medes and Persians, made alliances with Nabopolassar, ruler of the Babylonians and Chaldeans, and also the Scythians and Cimmerians against Assyria. At the Fall of Harran (609 BC), the Babylonians and Medes defeated an Assyrian-Egyptian alliance, after which Assyria largely ceased to exist as an independent state. A last defeat at Harran ended the Assyrian Empire. Although the empire fell, Assyrian history continued; there are still Assyrians living in Iran, Iraq, and elsewhere, in the present day. Background Assyria was originally an Akkadian kingdom which evolved in the 25th to 24th centuries BC. The earliest Assyrian kings such as Tudiya were relatively minor rulers, and after the founding of the Akkadian Empire, which lasted from 2334 BC to 2154 BC, these kings became subject to Sargon of Akkad, who united all the Akkadian- and Sumerian-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia (including the Assyrians) under one rule. The urbanised Akkadian-speaking nation of Assyria emerged in the mid 21st century BC, evolving from the dissolution of the Akkadian Empire. In the Old Assyrian period of the Early Bronze Age, Assyria had been a kingdom of northern Mesopotamia (modern-day northern Iraq), competing for dominance initially with the Hattians and Hurrians of Asia Minor, and the ancient Sumero-Akkadian \\"city states\\" such as Isin, Ur and Larsa, and later with Babylonia which was founded by Amorites in 1894 BC, and often under Kassite rule. During the 20th century BC, it established colonies in Asia Minor, and under the 20th century BC King Ilushuma, Assyria conducted many successful raids against the states of the south. Assyria fell under the control of the Amorite chieftain Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1809 ‚Äì 1776 BC), who established a dynasty and was unusually energetic and politically canny, installing his sons as puppet rulers at Mari and Ekallatum\\"Neo-Assyria\\", Colorado State University Following this it found itself under short periods of Babylonian and Mitanni- Hurrian domination in the 17th and 15th centuries BC respectively, followed by another period of power from 1365 BC to 1074 BC, that included the reigns of kings such as Ashur-uballit I, Tukulti-Ninurta I (r. 1244‚Äì1208 B.C.), and Tiglath-Pileser I.

E. S., The Cambridge Ancient History, Cambridge University Press, 1982 Much campaigning by Tiglath-Pileser and succeeding kings was directed against Aramaean pastoralist groups in Syria, some of whom were moving against Assyrian centers. By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Aramaean expansion had resulted in the loss of much Assyrian territory in Upper Mesopotamia. After the death of Tiglath-Pileser I in 1076 BC, Assyria was in comparative decline for the next 150 years. The period from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a Dark Age for the entire Near East, North Africa, Caucasus, Mediterranean and Balkan regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people. Assyria was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia and Media. History=Adad-nirari II and Ashurnasirpal II (911‚Äì859 BC) Assyrian ruler, possibly Ashurnasirpal II, accompanied by military attendants. Glazed Tile, Northwest Palace, Nimrud, 875-850 BC. Beginning with the campaigns of Adad-nirari II, Assyria again became a great power, ultimately overthrowing the Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt and conquering Elam, Urartu, Media, Persia, Mannea, Gutium, Phoenicia/Canaan, Arabia, Israel, Judah, Philistia, Edom, Moab, Samarra, Cilicia, Cyprus, Chaldea, Nabatea, Commagene, Dilmun, Shutu and Neo-Hittites; driving the Nubians, Kushites and Ethiopians from Egypt; defeating the Cimmerians and Scythians; and exacting tribute from Phrygia among others. Adad-nirari II and his successors campaigned on an annual basis for part of every year with an exceptionally well-organized army. He subjugated the areas previously under only nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting Aramean and Hurrian populations in the north to far- off places. Adad-nirari II then twice attacked and defeated Shamash-mudammiq of Babylonia, annexing a large area of land north of the Diyala river and the towns of Hit and Zanqu in mid Mesopotamia. He made further gains over Babylonia under Nabu-shuma-ukin I later in his reign. He was succeeded by Tukulti-Ninurta II in 891 BC, who further consolidated Assyria's position and expanded northwards into Asia Minor and the Zagros Mountains during his short reign. The next king, Ashurnasirpal II (883‚Äì859 BC), embarked on a vast program of expansion. During his rule, Assyria recovered much of the territory that it had lost around 1100 BC at the end of the Middle Assyrian period. Ashurnasirpal II also campaigned in the Zagros Mountains in modern Iran, repressing a revolt against Assyrian rule by the Lullubi and Gutians. The Assyrians began boasting in their ruthlessness around this time. Ashurnasirpal II also moved his capital to the city of Kalhu (Calah/Nimrud). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth and art. Ashurnasirpal II introduced a policy of mass deportation of conquered people, which continued on a greatly increased scale under his son, Shalmaneser III. Shalmaneser III to Adad-nirari III (859‚Äì783 BC) Ashurnasirpal's son, Shalmaneser III (859‚Äì824 BC), had a long reign of 35 years, in which the capital was converted into an armed camp. Each year the Assyrian armies marched out to campaign. Babylon was occupied, and Babylonia reduced to vassalage. He fought against Urartu and marched an army against an alliance of Aramean states headed by Hadadezer of Damascus and including Ahab, king of Israel, at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC. Despite Shalmaneser's description of 'vanquishing the opposition', it seems that the battle ended in a deadlock, as the Assyrian forces were withdrawn soon afterwards. Shalmaneser III receiving the tribute of \\"Jehu of the people of the land of Omri\\" (), referring to Jehu, king of northern Israel, as depicted on the Black Obelisk, circa 840 BCE. Shalmaneser took the neo Hittite state of Carchemish in 849 BC, and in 842 BC, marched an army against Hazael, King of Damascus, besieging the city and forcing tribute, but not taking it. In 841 BC, he also brought under tribute Jehu of Israel, and the Phoenician states of Tyre, and Sidon. His black obelisk, discovered at Kalhu, records many military exploits of his reign. The last four years of Shalmaneser's life were disturbed by the rebellion of his eldest son Ashur-nadin-aplu that nearly proved fatal to Assyria. Twenty seven cities, including Assur, Arbela, Arrapha (Kirkuk) and other places joined the pretender. The rebellion was not directed primarily against the king, but rather against the provisional governors such as Dayan- Ashur who had assumed disproportionate power. The revolt was quashed with difficulty by Shamshi-Adad V, Shalmaneser's second son, who succeeded him upon his death in 824 BC. The long and bitter civil war had allowed the Babylonians to the south, the Medes, Manneans, the Persians to the north and east, the Arameans, and the Neo-Hittites in the west to largely shake off Assyrian rule, and Shamshi-Adad V spent the remainder of his reign reasserting control over those peoples. During this period, Urartu took the opportunity to reassert its influence on the region. As a result of all these events, Assyria did not expand further during the reign of Shamshi-Adad V. Adad-nirari III was a boy when succeeding his father in 811 BC, and for five years until 806 BC, his mother, Queen Sammuramat (also depicted as Semiramis) ruled as regent in his stead. Despite the numerous legends regarding this queen, she is mentioned little in Assyrian records of the time. In 806 BC, Adad-nirari III took the reins of power. He invaded the Levant and subjugated the Arameans, Phoenicians, Philistines, Israelites, Neo-Hittites and Edomites. He entered Damascus and forced tribute upon its king Ben-Hadad III. He next turned to Iran, and subjugated the Persians, Medes and Manneans, penetrating as far as the Caspian Sea. His next targets were the Chaldean and Sutu tribes of southeastern Mesopotamia whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage. Period of stagnation, 783‚Äì745 BC Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 783 BC, and this led to a period of true stagnation. Shalmaneser IV (783‚Äì773 BC) seems to have wielded little authority, and a victory over Argishti I, king of Urartu at Til Barsip, is accredited to a general ('Turtanu') named Shamshi-ilu who does not even bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the Arameans and Neo-Hittites, and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king. Ashur-dan III ascended the throne in 772 BC. He proved to be a largely ineffectual ruler who was beset by internal rebellions in the cities of Ashur, Arrapkha, and Guzana. He failed to make further gains in Babylonia and Aram (Syria). His reign was also marred by Plague and an ominous Solar Eclipse. Ashur-nirari V became king in 754 BC, but his reign seems to have been one of permanent revolution, and he appears to have barely left his palace in Nineveh before he was deposed by Tiglath-Pileser III in 745 BC, bringing a resurgence to Assyria. Tiglath-Pileser III, 744‚Äì727 BC Deportation of Israelites by the Assyrian Empire When Tiglath-Pileser III ascended the throne, Assyria was in the throes of a revolution. Civil war and pestilence were devastating the country, and many of Assyria's most northerly colonies in Asia Minor had been wrested from it by Urartu. In 746 BC, the city of Kalhu joined the rebels, but on the 13th of Iyyar in the following year, an Assyrian general (Turtanu) named Pulu seized the crown under the name of Tiglath-Pileser III, and made sweeping changes to the Assyrian government, considerably improving its efficiency and security. The conquered provinces were organized under an elaborate bureaucracy, with the king at the head‚Äîeach district paying a fixed tribute and providing a military contingent. The Assyrian forces at this time became a professional standing army. Assyrian policy was henceforth directed toward reducing the whole civilized world into a single empire, throwing its trade and wealth into Assyrian hands. These changes are often identified as the beginning of the \\"Second Assyrian Empire\\". When Tiglath-Pileser III had ascended the throne of Assyria, he invaded Babylonia, defeated its king Nabonassar, and abducted the gods of ≈†apazza; these events are recorded in the Assyrian-Babylonian Chronicle.ABC 1 Col.1:5 After subjecting Babylon to tribute, defeating Urartu and conquering the Medes, Persians and Neo-Hittites, Tiglath-Pileser III directed his armies into Aramea, of which large swathes had regained independence, and the commercially successful Mediterranean seaports of Phoenicia. He took Arpad near Aleppo in 740 BC after a siege of three years, and razed Hamath. Azariah, king of Judah had been an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath- Pileser to do him homage and pay yearly tribute. =Invasion of Israel (738 BC)= Astartu (in the land of king Og of Bashan, east of the Jordan river), by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III about 730‚Äì727 BCE, as depicted on a palace relief now kept on display at the British Museum. In 738 BC, during the reign of king Menahem of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser III occupied Philistia (modern-day southwestern Israel and the Gaza Strip) and invaded Israel, imposing on it a heavy tribute.2 Kings 15:19 Ahaz, king of Judah, engaged in a war against Israel and Aramea, appealed for help to the Assyrian king by means of presents of gold and silver;2 Kings 16:8 Tiglath-Pileser III accordingly \\"marched against Damascus, defeated and put king Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself\\". Leaving part of his army to continue the siege, he advanced, ravaging with fire and sword the provinces east of the Jordan (Nabatea, Moab and Edom), Philistia, and Samaria; and in 732 BC he took the chief Aramean state of Damascus, deporting many of its inhabitants and the Israelite inhabitants of Samaria to Assyria. He also forced tribute from the Arabs of the deserts in the Arabian peninsula. In 729 BC, Tiglath-Pileser III went to Babylonia and captured Nabu-mukin-zeri, the king of Babylon.ABC 1 Col.1:21 He had himself crowned as King Pulu of Babylon. Tiglath-Pileser III died in 727 BC, and was succeeded by Shalmaneser V. However, King Hoshea of Israel suspended paying tribute, and allied himself with Egypt against Assyria in 725 BC. This led Shalmaneser to invade Syria2 Kings 17:5 and besiege Samaria (capital city of Israel) for three years.ABC 1 Col.1:27 Sargonid dynastySargon II, 721‚Äì705 BC= An Assyrian lamassu, from Sargon's palace at Dur-Sharrukin. Shalmaneser V died suddenly in 722 BC, while laying siege to Samaria, and the throne was seized by Sargon II, the Turtanu (commander-in- chief of the army, which the Jewish sources record as Tartan), who then quickly took Samaria, effectively ending the northern Kingdom of Israel and carrying 27,000 people away into captivity into the Israelite diaspora.2 Kings 17:1‚Äì6, 24; 18:7, 9 Sargon II waged war in his second year (721 BC) against the king of Elam, Humban-Nikash I, and his ally Marduk-apal-iddina II (the biblical Merodach-Baladan), the Chaldean ruler of Babylon, who had thrown off Assyrian rule,2 Kings 20:12 but Sargon was unable to dislodge him on this occasion.ABC 1 Col.1:31‚Äì37 Sargon, able to contain the revolt but not actually retake Babylon on this occasion, turned his attention again to Urartu and Aramea, taking Carchemish in 717, as well as re-conquering the Medes, Persians and Manneans, penetrating the Iranian Plateau as far as Mount Bikni and building several fortresses. Urartu suffered a crushing defeat‚Äîits capital city was sacked and its king Rusas committed suicide in shame. The Neo-Hittite states of northern Syria were conquered, as well as Cilicia and Commagene. Assyria was belligerent towards Babylonia for ten years while Marduk-apla- iddina ruled Babylon.ABC 1 Col.1:41‚Äì42 In 710 BC, Sargon attacked Babylonia and defeated Marduk-apla-iddina, who fled to his protectors in Elam.ABC 1 Col.2:1‚Äì3 As a result of this victory the Greek rulers of Cyprus gave allegiance to Assyria and king Midas of Phrygia, fearful of Assyrian power, offered his hand in friendship. Sargon also built a new capital at Dur Sharrukin (\\"Sargon's City\\") near Nineveh, with all the tribute Assyria had collected from various nations. =Sennacherib, 705‚Äì681 BC= Assyrian Crown-Prince, ca. 704‚Äì681 BC. Nineveh, Mesopotamia. Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 705 BC, Sargon was killed in battle while driving out the Cimmerians, who had come down from their homeland on the shores of the Black Sea and attacked the Assyrian-ruled colonies and peoples in Iran, forcing its Persian subjects southwards from their original lands around Urmia. He was succeeded by his son Sennacherib.2 Kings 18:13; 19:37; Isa. 7:17, 18 His first task was to affirm his control over Cilicia, which was attempting to rebel with Greek help. Sennacherib marched into Cilicia, defeating the rebels and their Greek allies. He also reasserted Assyria's mastery of Corduene in Asia Minor. Sennacherib decided to move the capital from Sargon's Dur-Sharrukin to the city of Nineveh, and in Nineveh he built the famous \\"the Palace without a Rival\\", he made Nineveh a beautiful city and improved the city, planting orchards and gardens. Neo-Assyrian Empire, showing Judah in grey The Egyptians had begun agitating peoples within the Assyrian empire in an attempt to gain a foothold in the region. As a result, in 701 BC, Hezekiah of Judah, Lule king of Sidon, Sidka, king of Ascalon and the king of Ekron formed an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. Sennacherib attacked the rebels, conquering Ascalon, Sidon and Ekron and defeating the Egyptians and driving them from the region. He marched toward Jerusalem, destroying 46 towns and villages (including the heavily defended city of Lachish) in his path. This is graphically described in Isaiah 10; exactly what happened next is unclear (the Bible says an angel of the Lord killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers at Jerusalem after Hezekiah prayed in the temple).II Kings 18‚Äì19 Sennacherib's account says Judah paid him tribute and he left. The Hebrew Bible states that Hezekiah did pay tribute once, and the Assyrians left, but returned a second time when the soldiers were then killed; however what is certain is that Sennacherib failed to actually capture Jerusalem. Marduk-apla-iddina had returned to Babylonia during the reign of Sennacherib. The Assyrian king attacked him in 703 BC outside Kish and defeated him. Sennacherib plundered Babylonia and pursued Marduk-apla-iddina through the land. At his return to Assyria, Sennacherib installed a puppet ruler, Bel-ibni, as king of Babylon.ABC 1 Col.2:12‚Äì23 Bel- ibni, however, committed hostilities, so Sennacherib returned to Babylon in 700 BC and captured him and his officers. Sennacherib instead installed his own son Ashur-nadin-shumi on the throne of Babylon.ABC 1 Col.2:26‚Äì31 Assyrian warship, a bireme with pointed bow, 700 BC. Sennacherib launched a campaign against Elam in 694 BC and ravaged the land. In retaliation, the king of Elam attacked Babylonia. Ashur-nadin-shumi was captured and brought back to Elam and a new king called Nergal-ushezib was installed as ruler of Babylon.ABC 1 Col.2:36‚Äì45 The Assyrians returned the next year to Babylonia and plundered the gods of Uruk. Nergal-u≈°ezib and his Elamite allies were defeated by Assyria, and he was taken prisoner and transported to Assyria.ABC 1 Col.2:46 ‚Äì Col.3:6 Another native ruler, called Mushezib-Marduk, soon seized the throne of Babylon. He held on to it with help of his Elamite allies for four years until 689 BC, when the Assyrians retook the city.ABC 1 Col.3:13‚Äì24 Sennacherib responded swiftly by opening the canals around Babylon and flooding the outside of the city until it became a swamp, resulting in its destruction, and its inhabitants were scattered. In 681 BC, Sennacherib was murdered while praying to the god Nisroch by one or more of his own sons (allegedly named Adremelech, Abimlech, and Sharezer), perhaps as retribution for his destruction of Babylon.According to 2 Kings 19:37, while praying to the god Nisroch, he was killed by two of his sons, Adramalech, and Sharezer, and both of these sons subsequently fled to Urartu; this is repeated in Isaiah 37:38 and alluded to in 2 Chronicles 32:21. =Esarhaddon, 681‚Äì669 BC= The Victory stele of Esarhaddon was created following the king's victory in Egypt and depicts Esarhaddon in a majestic pose with a war mace in his hand and a vassal king before him. Also present is the son of Taharqa, the defeated pharaoh, kneeling and with a rope around his neck. Sennacherib was succeeded by his son Esarhaddon (Ashur-ahhe-iddina), who had been governor of Babylonia; at the time of his father's murder he was campaigning in the Caucasus Mountains against Urartu, where he won a victory at Malatia (Milid). During the first year of Esarhaddon's rule, a rebellion broke out in the south of Babylonia. Nabu-zer-kitti-li≈°ir, an ethnic Elamite governor of the mat Tamti, with the help of the Chaldeans, laid siege to Ur. The Elamite and his Chaldean allies were defeated and he fled to his kinsmen in Elam (Hal-Tamti); however, \\"the king of Elam took him prisoner and put him to the sword\\" (ABC 1 Col.3:39‚Äì42); also in (ABC 14:1‚Äì4). In 679 BC the Cimmerians and Scythians (a horse-riding horde from what is now southern Russia) crossed the Taurus Mountains and harassed Assyrian colonies in Cilicia. Esarhaddon swiftly attacked and drove these marauders away. As king of Assyria, Esarhaddon immediately had Babylon rebuilt. Defeating the Scythians, Cimmerians and Medes (again penetrating to Mt. Bikni), he then turned his attention westward to Phoenicia‚Äînow allying itself with the Nubian/Kushite rulers of Egypt against him‚Äîand sacked Sidon in 677 BC. He also captured King Manasseh of Judah and kept him prisoner for some time in Babylon (2 Chronicles 33:11). Having had enough of Egyptian meddling, Esarhaddon raided Egypt in 673 BC. Two years later he launched a full invasion and conquered Egypt, chasing the Pharaoh Taharqa back to Nubia, thus bringing to an end Nubian-Kushite rule in Egypt, and destroying the Kushite Empire which had begun in 760 BC. The Babylonian Chronicles retells how Egypt \\"was sacked and its gods were abducted\\".ABC 1 Col.4:25; also in ABC 14:28‚Äì29 The pharaoh Tirhakah fled Egypt, and a stele commemorating the victory, was set up at Sinjerli in Asia Minor, north of the Gulf of Antioch; it is now in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin. The Bible graphically recounts Egypt's demise in Isaiah 20:4 \\"So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 5 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.\\" Assyria defeated Urartu, annexed much of its territory and reduced it to vassalage, and expanded southwards as far as Dilmun (Bahrain) and into Arabia at this time. This was perhaps Assyria's greatest territorial extent. However, the Assyrian governors and local puppet rulers Esarhaddon had appointed over Egypt were obliged to flee the restive native populace who yearned for independence now that the Kushites and Nubians had been ejected. A new campaign was launched by Esarhaddon in 669 BC. However, he became ill on the way and died. His elder son Shamash-shum-ukin became king of Babylon and his son Ashurbanipal became king of Assyria, with Ashurbanipal holding the senior position and Babylon subject to Nineveh.ABC 1 Col.4:30‚Äì33 and ABC 14:31‚Äì32, 37 Bel and the gods of Babylonia returned from their exile in Assur to Babylon in the first year of Shamash-shum-ukin's reign, and the akitu festival could be celebrated for the first time in twenty years.ABC 1 14:34‚Äì39 and ABC 1 Col.4:34‚Äì36 =Ashurbanipal, 668‚Äì631 BC= Part of the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal, c. 645‚Äì635 BC Ashurbanipal, or \\"Ashur- bani-apli\\" (Ashurbanapli, Asnapper), succeeded his father Esarhaddon to the throne. He continued to campaign in and to dominate Egypt, when not distracted by having to deal with pressures from the Medes to the east, and Cimmerians and Scythians to the north of Assyria. He installed a native Egyptian Pharaoh, Psammetichus, as a vassal king in 664 BC. However, after Gyges of Lydia's appeal for Assyrian help against the Cimmerians was rejected, Lydian mercenaries were sent to Psammetichus. By 652 BC, this vassal king was able to declare outright independence from Assyria with impunity, particularly as Ashurbanipal's older brother, Shamash-shum-ukin of Babylon, became infused with Babylonian nationalism, and began a major civil war in that year. However, the new dynasty in Egypt wisely maintained friendly relations with Assyria. Shamash-shum-ukin attempted to raise a huge rebellion encompassing many vassal peoples against Ashurbanipal; however, this largely failed. This rebellion lasted until 648 BC, when Babylon was sacked, and Shamash-shum-ukin set fire to the palace, killing himself. Ashurbanipal then set about punishing the Chaldeans, Arabs and Nabateans who had supported the Babylonian revolt. He invaded the Arabian Peninsula and routed and subjugated the Arabs, including the powerful Qedar tribe, taking much booty back to Nineveh and killing the Arab kings, Abiate and Uate. The Nabateans who dwelt south of the Dead Sea and in northern Arabia, and the Chaldeans in the far south east of Mesopotamia were also defeated and subjugated. Elam was the next target; it was attacked in 646 and 640 BC, and its capital Susa sacked. Babylonian prisoners under Assyrian guard, reign of Ashurbanipal 668-630 BCE, Nineveh, British Museum ME 124788 After the crushing of the Babylonian revolt Ashurbanipal appeared master of all he surveyed. To the east, Elam was devastated and prostrate before Assyria, the Manneans and the Iranian Persians and Medes were vassals. To the south, Babylonia was occupied, the Chaldeans, Arabs, Sutu and Nabateans subjugated, the Nubian empire destroyed, and Egypt paid tribute. To the north, the Scythians and Cimmerians had been vanquished and driven from Assyrian territory, Urartu, Phrygia, Corduene and the neo Hittites were in vassalage, and Lydia pleaded for Assyrian protection. To the west, Aramea (Syria), the Phoenicians, Israel, Judah, Samarra and Cyprus were subjugated, and the Hellenised inhabitants of Caria, Cilicia, Cappadocia and Commagene paid tribute to Assyria. Assyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, his long struggle with Babylonia and Elam and their allies, and the constant campaigning to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, left Assyria exhausted. It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, and it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison the huge empire. Assyria, therefore, was ill-prepared to face the renewed hordes of Scythians who now began to harass the frontiers to the north and north east. After the Assyrians destroyed Elam, the Medes had begun to grow powerful, becoming the dominant force among the Iranian peoples who had begun to settle the regions to the east of Mesopotamia circa 1000 BC at the expense of the Persians and the pre-Iranian Elamites and Manneans, and they were by the end of Ashurbanipal's reign only nominally under Assyrian vassalage. Asia Minor too was full of hostile Scythians and Cimmerians who had overrun Urartu, Lydia and Phrygia, before being driven back by the Assyrians. However, while Ashurbanipal lived, he was able to contain these potential threats. Fall of Assyria, 631‚Äì609 BC In 605 BCE, an Egyptian force fought the Babylonians at Battle of Carchemish, helped by the remnants of the army of the former Assyria, but this too met with defeat. The empire began to disintegrate rapidly after a series of bitter civil wars broke out involving a number of claimants to the throne. Ashur-etil-ilani succeeded Ashurbanipal, but his reign was short and he was succeeded in 627 BC by his brother Sinsharishkun. After dealing with the revolt of the general Sin-shumu-lishir, Sinsharishkun faced a much larger threat. His Babylonian vassal state had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria and rebelled under the previously unknown Nabopolassar, a member of the Chaldean tribe, in 625 BC. What followed was a long war fought in the Babylonian heartland. Nabopolassar tried to capture Nippur, the main Assyrian center of power in Babylonia, but was defeated by Sinsharishkun. However, Nabopolassar did take the actual city of Babylon after a popular uprising there, and was crowned king of the city in 625 BC. Sinsharishkun then lost more ground, before he succeeded in recapturing Uruk in about 624 BC, only to quickly lose it again. When Sinsharishkun led a large army to Babylonia in 623 BC, in an attempt to finally crush the rebellion, yet another war broke out in the Assyrian homeland. A relief army was sent back from the Babylonian campaign but changed sides, thereby allowing the usurper to reach the capital, Nineveh, without interference, and claim the throne. Sinsharishkun was able to quell the homeland rebellion, but precious time was lost to solve the Babylonian problem, and Nabopolassar was able to consolidate his position. In 620 BC, Nabopolassar finally captured Nippur, becoming master of Babylonia. While these events were unfolding, the Medes had also freed themselves from Assyrian domination and consolidated power in what was to become Persia. In 616 BC, Cyaxares, the Median king, made an alliance with Nabopolassar, and with the help of the Scythians and Cimmerians, attacked Assyria. Assyria now faced overwhelming odds, and after four years of bitter fighting, the coalition destroyed Nineveh in 612 BC, after a three-month siege, followed by house-to-house fighting. Sinsharishkun was killed in the process, and the Fall of Nineveh marked the beginning of the end of the Assyrian Empire. A general called Ashur-uballit II was declared king of Assyria, and with belated military support from the Egyptian pharaoh Necho II, whose dynasty had been installed with the help of the Assyrians, held out at Harran until 609 BC.Grant, R G. Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2005 pg 19 Egyptian aid continued to the Assyrians, who desperately attempted to curb the increasing power of the Babylonians and Medes. In 609 BC, at the Battle of Megiddo, an Egyptian force defeated a Judean force under king Josiah and managed to reach the last remnants of the Assyrian army. In a final battle at Harran in 609 BC, the Babylonians and Medes defeated the Assyrian-Egyptian alliance, after which Assyria ceased to exist as an independent state. It is not known if Ashur- uballit II was killed at Harran or if he survived; anyway, he subsequently disappeared from the pages of history. In 605 BC, another Egyptian force fought the Babylonians (Battle of Carchemish), helped by the remnants of the army of the former Assyria, but this too met with defeat. In the mid-6th century BC, Babylonia and Assyria became provinces of the Persian Empire. In 520 BC, Assyria made a final attempt to regain independence, with a large- scale rebellion against the Achaemenid Empire, which was suppressed by king Darius the Great. Though the Assyrians during the reign of Ashurbanipal destroyed the Elamite civilization, the Assyrians' culture did influence the succeeding empires of the Medes and the Persians, Indo-Iranian peoples who had been dominated by Assyria. =Environmental factors= A.W. Schneider and S.F. Adah have suggested that increased population coupled with severe drought contributed to significant economic and political instability.Schuster, Ruth. \\"Assyrian Empire was destroyed by drought and crowding, study says\\", Haaretz April 11, 2015 Conquered peoples were often deported great distances and resettled in Assyrian provinces to minimize the possibility of revolts. The Assyrian heartland had undergone a population explosion during the late 8th and early 7th centuries, largely due to the forced resettlement of conquered peoples into the empire. However, a study on mineral deposits in two stalagmites taken from northern Iraq's Kuna Ba Cave, indicates to a shift from a wet climate to a dry one between 675 and 550 B.C., which might have contributed to the fall of Neo-Assyrian Empire. Assyria after the fall After its fall, Assyria came to be ruled by the Median Empire as Athura for a short period. Ironically, Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon, was Assyrian, originating from Harran, as was his son Belshazzar. After this it was ruled by Achaemenid Persia (Assyria revolted against Persia in 520 BC), the Greek Seleucid kings, then again by various Persian dynasties, Sassanids, Parthians, etc. For a brief period under Trajan, it was ruled by Rome. Assyria survived as an entity, a subject province. The name survived also in various forms (Athura, Asuristan, Roman Province of Assyria, Seleucid Syria, etc.) and the land was recognised as such by the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Armenians, Georgians and Byzantines. After the Arab conquest of the late 7th century AD the province of Assyria was finally dissolved. Assyrian culture survived; Assyrio-Babylonian gods were worshipped well into Christian times, as late as the 4th century AD , and temples were still being dedicated to the god Ashur in his home city in the late 3rd century AD. A number of kingdoms that had Assyrian identity, such as Assur, Hatra, Osrhoene and Adiabene, sprung up in Assyria between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD. Christianity took hold between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, and Parthian and Sassanid Assyria (Asuristan) became the center of the Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Christianity and Syriac literature (the term \\"Syria\\" being an Indo-European (Luwian) corruption of \\"Assyria\\" adopted by the Greeks),http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf where it still survives. Role of Aramaic Tiglath Pileser III made Aramaic the lingua franca of the empire, originally the language of the Arameans. Aramaic was easier to write than Akkadian, so older documents collected by Assyrian kings were translated from Akkadian into Aramaic, and newer ones were written in Aramaic and ignored the Akkadian. Aramaic was the common language of the people and traders, but the official government language was the Neo-Assyrian dialect of Akkadian. By the 6th century, Aramaic had marginalised the Akkadian language so much that Aramaic came to be the imperial language of Achaemenid Assyria. One of the key factors contributing to the use of Aramaic was the rise and fall of Assyria; during its rule, deportations, colonisations, and intermarriage increased contact between Arameans and Assyrians. In effect the populations of both Assyria and Babylonia had become an ethnic mix of native Akkadians and Arameans. Even though Aramaic was the common tongue of the empire, Akkadian continued to be the preferred language of royalty and the elites. Rulers, royalty and elites were all trained to speak both Aramaic and Akkadian until, by the 7th century BC, the ruling class was fully bilingual. The rest of the empire was divided into two sects: those who spoke Aramaic and those who spoke Akkadian. Generally, the common people and traders were also bilingual but Aramaic continued to dominate the empire outside Assyria proper. As the Empire fell, only the elite knew how to read and write the Akkadian script. The savage sacking of Nineveh and Assur, as well as numerous other Assyrian cities, ensured that few of these elites survived to pass on the language, but some cities such as Arrapkha were spared the destruction. Akkadian survived the fall of Assyria; the last recorded writings in Akkadian cuneiform date from the 1st century AD, and writings in Akkadian (but in the Aramaic/Syriac script) date as late as the 3rd century AD. Administration The Assyrian empire expanded through establishing provinces and vassal states.Parker, Bradley J. The Mechanics of Empire: The Northern Frontier of Assyria as a Case Study in Imperial Dynamics. University of Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project. 2001. Many of these lands were under control by members of the king's court. Most of these offices had names that were titular, but holders of these offices may have enacted their namesakes in ceremonial manners.Mattila, Raija. The King‚Äôs Magnates: A Study of the Highest Officials of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. University of Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project. 2000. The provinces were a form of territorial control and were made up of the capital city, farming villages, road stations, outposts, and garrisons. The province itself was managed by the provincial governor, who also had militaristic duties like gathering and reporting military intelligence, or leading Assyrian armies in battle. As governors, they only answered to the king, and certain officials of the king's high court. A state communication system, consisting of mule riders travelling in royal road with change stations within certain intervals, allowed the imperial court to communicate efficiently with the governors. Those directly beneath the governors were their deputy governors, and they oversaw a number of auxiliary officials like bureaucrats, scribes, and accountants. The lowest rank in the provincial government were the village managers who mostly supervised local farming efforts and projects. The vassal states were under hegemonic control and these were territories gained through a show of military dominance ‚Äì by either forcing their way through or proving that they could. Those who submitted peacefully remained relatively autonomous and their ruling elites were permitted to stay in power. Those who resisted were overthrown and had their rulers replaced with puppet officials loyal to Assyria. The terms for vassalage were that the vassal state was to pay Assyria tribute in the form of goods, labor, and soldiers in exchange for military protection. The protection provided by Assyria seemed to suit the needs of Assyria more than the needs of the vassal states, as Assyria have used a perceived threat toward a vassal state as an excuse to invade nearby settlements, and the vassal states have also been left to fend for themselves. Assyrians invented a new way of dealing with conquered people. After conquering a land, its people would be resettled to other areas within the empire, with land and state assistance. This policy was used to create a uniform population, although it produced some hotbeds of dissent. By the 7th century BC, the royal entourage included scholars, craftsmen and singers from Babylonia, Anatolia, Egypt, and Iran.Adam Hart- Davis, History: the Definitive Visual Guide: from the Dawn of Civilization to the Present Day (New York: DK Pub., 2012), p.80) Army The Assyrian empire has been described as the \\"first military power in history\\". Mesopotamia was the site of some of the earliest recorded battles in history. The Assyrian army's hierarchy was typical of the Mesopotamian armies at the time. The King whose rule was sanctioned by the gods, would be the commander of the entire army of the Empire. He would appoint senior officers on certain occasions to campaign in his place if his presence on the battlefield could or had to be spared.Healy, The Ancient Assyrians, p. 19 The Neo-Assyrian Empire took advantage of many different types and styles of militaristic vessels and engines for warfare. This includes chariots, cavalry, and siege engines.

The British Museum.jpgBeheaded enemies in Southern Mesopotamia File:Assyrian battering ram.jpgAssyrian battering ram Society Eunuchs carrying war tribute The Neo-Assyrian Empire was a warlike society with an expansionist ideology and, as a result of their constant expansion, they acquired a diverse and multi-ethnic empire. One Assyrian identity did not happen until, ironically, Ashurnasirpal II began deporting people from the empire. The majority of the displaced peoples were settled in the urban heart of the empire bringing with them what would become the common language: Aramaic, the first unifying factor. The spreading of Aramaic is known as the Aramaization period and soon the new language would become the common language as well as the imperial language. As the people settled in the new land, they became exposed to Assyrian cultural ideas such as \\"royal ideologies, religious ideas and mythologies...\\" and it \\"was incessantly propagated to all segments of the population through imperial art, emperor cult, religious festivals, and the cults of A≈°≈°ur, I≈°tar, Nab√ª, S√Æn and other Assyrian gods.\\" This was a process known as \\"Assyrianization.\\" The process of Assyrianization was a gradual process that occurred through generations of intermarriages, military participation, and daily interaction with Assyrian people (those who were not descended from the deportees generations earlier). Through the generations of cultural and linguistic exchange there came to be a homogenous Assyrian identity. Eunuchs in elite society Eunuchs often filled roles as servants to the kings and accompanied him in almost all aspects of ruling, such as administrative duties and rituals. Royal eunuchs were regularly promoted to being provincial governors and they could rule the lands as they saw fit; they could \\"erect their own steles, place their names before that of the king's, and grant zakatu (tax- free status) to their subjects.\\" As governors of their own lands, they had the right to declare war on other governances and collect any tribute that may have resulted from the battles. Culture Several of the most ancient works of Mesopotamian literature are best preserved in Neo-Assyrian copies. Thus, there are 7th-century copies of both the Epic of Gilgamesh and the En√ªma Eli≈° from Ashurbanipal's library in Nineveh, as well as Neo-Assyrian versions of the Atra-Hasis. Neo-Assyrian cuneiform is the final stage of the long evolution of the cuneiform script. The number of glyphs was reduced, and the glyph shapes were standardized and simplified, so that modern cuneiform sign inventories are usually based on the Neo-Assyrian glyph shapes. Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use alongside the Aramaic alphabet well into Parthian times. The Aramaic language from the 8th century BC was adopted as the Lingua Franca of the Assyrian Empire and continued by the Achaemenid Empire. Assyrian scribes are often depicted in pairs: one writing in Akkadian on the cuneiform tablet, the other writing in Aramaic on the parchment or papyrus. The main cities that existed in Assyria itself were Nineveh, Ashur, Kalhu (Calah, Nimrud), Sippar, Opis, Arrapha (Kirkuk), Harran, Arbela (Erbil) and Ekallatum. Outside of Assyria proper, major cities at various times under Assyrian domination were Babylon, Damascus (Dimashq), Thebes, Memphis, Tyre, Sidon, Ecbatana, Hattusa, Jerusalem, Susa, Persepolis, Carchemish, Sardis, Ur, Uruk, Nippur and Antioch. At the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than Babylon, but still one of the world's major cities (population about 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city of that time. All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ilku-service. The Assyrian law code was compiled during this period.

Examples of countries' folk traditions that incorporate body percussion include Indonesian saman, Ethiopian armpit music, palmas in flamenco, and the hambone from the United States. Body percussion is a subset of \\"body music\\".Percussive Notes -1984 Volume 23 - Page 50 \\"Body music was probably the first music - before people began slapping rocks and hollowing logs for drums, they were probably stomping, clapping and grunting to express their musical ideas. There are many body musics still thriving today: in the United States hambone was popular at the turn of the century and is still in practice; some South Pacific island people create music by clapping and slapping the chest and thighs; in Morocco there is a version that involves beating the chest... These are only a few examples of a varied and vital body music scene....\\"  Body percussion sounds  Percussion instruments produce their sound when a player hits, scrapes, rubs or shakes them to produce vibrations. These techniques can also be applied to the human body. The body also presents several unique possibilities including the use of inhaled or exhaled air and vocal sounds. Traditionally the four main body percussion sounds (in order from lowest pitch to highest in pitch) are: #Stomping: Striking left, right, or both feet against the floor or other resonant surface #Patting: Patting either the left, right, or both thighs or cheeks with hands #Clapping hands together #Snapping fingers However, there are numerous other possibilities including: hitting the chest, whistling, slapping or flicking the cheeks with an open mouth, clicking with the tongue against the roof of the mouth, grunting, and hitting the buttocks. Variations of sound are possible through changing the playing technique. For example, clapping the hands in various positions will affect factors such as pitch and resonance.  Music education  Body percussion is used extensively in music education, because of its accessibility‚Äîthe human body is the original musical instrument and the only instrument that every student possesses. Using the body in this manner gives students a direct experience of musical elements, such as beat, rhythm, and metre and helps a student internalise rhythmic skills. Certain approaches to music education, including Orff, Kod√°ly and BapneBapne make particular use of body percussion.  Performers  Body percussion may be performed solo or several performers may combine to create a musical ensemble. One of the most accomplished body percussion soloists is Keith Terry. Terry resides in San Francisco, California and in the 1980s he established Cross Pulse, a non-profit organization dedicated to the creation, performance and recording of rhythm-based, intercultural music and dance. Perhaps the most famous body percussion ensemble is the United Kingdom percussion group Stomp. Stomp perform in a musical genre known as trash percussion, which involves the use of non-traditional instruments combined with body percussion. In Brazil, the most well-known body percussion group is Barbatuques.

It is named for the historic Viscounty of L√©on, in the d√©partements of C√¥tes-d'Armor and Finist√®re in the extreme north-west of Brittany. It is valued for the quality of its milk, which is yellow and high in fat, and is particularly suitable for making into butter.  History  In the early years of the twentieth century there were some 35 000 Froment du L√©on cattle. A herd-book was opened in 1907. Froment du L√©on cows participated in the Concours G√©n√©ral Agricole de Paris between 1914 and 1939. In 1950 the breed population was about 25 000, but fell rapidly thereafter due to competition from other dairy breeds, first the Normande and later the Friesian. In 1968 there were only 2500 head, and by 1977 no more than 50 cows remained. From about 1960 there was some limited cross-breeding with Guernsey stock from the United Kingdom and from Canada. A new breed society, the Syndicat d'√âleveurs Froment du L√©on, was formed in 1981, and a recovery and conservation project was launched following the discovery in 1978 of a small number of surviving animals in the historic region of the C√¥tes-d'Armor. The Froment du L√©on was listed by the FAO as \\"endangered-maintained\\" in 2007. By 2010 there were 276 cows in 97 farms. In 2014 the total population was reported to be 314.  Characteristics  The coat of the Froment du L√©on is wheat-coloured; there may be some white markings. The muzzle and mucosa are pale. Cows weigh about and stand about at the withers.  Use  The Froment du L√©on is a dairy breed. Milk production is around in a lactation of 305 days. The milk is rich in beta-carotene, which gives it a yellow colour. It has a high fat content, almost 5.5%, which makes it particularly suitable for butter-making.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on November 7, 2002. It was later published in Europe by Xplosiv on September 3, 2004. On October 20, 2004, Activision Value published a version of the game that was developed by Airborne Entertainment for J2ME and BREW- enabled mobile phones, as well as the N-Gage QD. It was named after American businessman Donald Trump, who also provided his voice for both versions of the game. Gameplay Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon is a single-player video game. The player's goal is to beat Donald Trump by becoming the most influential business magnate. In the Windows version, the player must choose the best real estate location in one of five cities: Los Angeles, New York City, Atlantic City, London and Paris. The mobile version consists of only one city. Each city is viewed from an isometric perspective. Each of the five cities contain an office, which opens at 6:00 AM and closes at 10:00 PM. Because of this, the player will sometimes have to focus on other cities or wait. The game features four different types of real estate: commercial, hotel, office, and residential. Each type of real estate comes in three different building sizes: small, medium, and large. Trump checks on the player's progress every six months in the game. If Trump is impressed with the player's progress, he will promote the player up an additional floor in his headquarters. The player's goal is to reach Trump on the top floor. Trump also offers advice and hints to the player throughout the game. A player may choose and purchase a piece of real estate. The price varies on its size or how long the game progresses. After the land is purchased, a building can be constructed on it. Before construction, the style, quality, number of floors (up to 12) and building duration are to be selected. The better the quality of the building and the slower the construction time, the higher the cost. Each floor of the building can be made into three types of rooms: shops, offices or condos. Shops are the most expensive to build but can be marketed at a higher price. Offices generate rather small profits but are cheaper to construct. Once a building is complete, the player can market the rooms in one of two ways: selling or leasing. Through selling, a complete payment is achieved instantly. In leasing, payments are received on a monthly basis. When short on budget, the player can borrow money from any of four banks. Loans are paid back automatically after an assigned number of months (the money the player has in hand will have some deduction for this matter). Therefore, sufficient amounts of profit have to be earned after borrowing. A building's quality deteriorates over time. When reusing them for commercial purpose, it is best to have them renovated. Through renovation, certain rooms can be changed into others. A change in the building's style and number of floors can only be achieved through demolition and reconstruction. Challenging Trump If the five city levels are passed, the player then faces a business competition with Trump. The object of the challenge is to go into business against Trump for a fixed number of years and then come out with higher profit, with the ultimate goal of driving him into bankruptcy. Unlike the previous missions, natural disasters and criminal activity occur which cause damage to property. The mobile version also allows the player to overtake Trump in the business industry. Reception Avery Score of GameSpot gave the N-Gage QD version a 7.2 out of 10. Score called the game's auction sequences \\"incredibly boring\\", and wrote that \\"despite the game's 'unique branding', it is ‚Äì at heart ‚Äì a typical tycoon game that doesn't depart in any way from the conventions of the genre. While the game could have benefited from more-varied gameplay and smarter rival artificial intelligence, Real Estate Tycoons strong presentation makes it an offering worthy of notice by fans of business simulations.\\" Score praised the game's graphics, and wrote that while the game does not feature \\"much of an audio component, what's there is decent. No background music accompanies the gameplay, sadly, but your biannual reviews by Mr. Trump feature a vocal clip from the man himself.\\" Score concluded that while the game \\"doesn't have any major flaws, it does fail to provide a varied experience. [...] After you're promoted 99 times, the game is over, but it's likely most gamers will tire of the game before they reach this level, as there's only one city in the game, and only so much you can do there. Doing nothing but buying low and selling high can hold one's interest for only so long.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2002 video games Category:Business simulation games Category:Mobile games Category:N-Gage games Category:Windows games Category:Video games based on real people Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Cultural depictions of Donald Trump ","title":"Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon"},{"id":"12688759","text":"America Bangladesh University () or ABU is a name used by several private universities, none of which are recognised by the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh (UCG).

Smith signed for the Colorado Rapids of the MLS in January 2009, however the contract was terminated once doctors detected a problem with his heart, and he was forced to retire. Smith re-signed for Ebbsfleet United (previously known as Gravesend & Northfleet) in November 2009, after having surgery and being told by doctors it was safe to play again. In December, he said he was planning to leave Ebbsfleet to return to the United States. On February 15, 2010, Smith signed with Portland Timbers. Following the season, and with the Timbers move to Major League Soccer, Smith ended his playing career, and on March 10, 2011 he was named as a radio analyst for Timbers home matches. On January 27, 2012, Smith resumed his playing career and signed with Ebbsfleet United for a third spell with the Kent club. That ended in 2013 and since then he has been a TV analyst for all Timbers matches broadcast locally. Personal life Although born in Canada, both Smith's parents are Scottish-born giving him dual British and Canadian citizenship.

He lived as an invalid until 1923, when he joined with fellow Catholics from the Liverpool area and journeyed to the Catholic shrines at Lourdes. Biography Traynor was born in Liverpool; his mother was a migrant from Ireland. He attended St. Patrick's Primary School, leaving school to become a sailor in the merchant marine. In 1907 he became a stoker in the Royal Navy Reserve joining the regular Navy at the start of World War I. He was wounded near Bruges on 8 October 1914, but recovered. He was hit by machine gun fire on 8 May 1915 while participating in a bayonet charge in the Gallipoli Campaign, losing the use of his right arm and beginning to suffer from epilepsy, and was discharged with an 80% pension. In April 1920, a surgeon in Liverpool attempted to cure the epilepsy by trepanning, an operation that was reported to have resulted in the partial paralysis of both legs. In 1923 he traveled to Lourdes with a group of pilgrims from Liverpool, dipping in the baths nine times. While there he is said to have been cured. In his book, Battlefield Tourism: Pilgrimage and the Commemoration of the Great War in Britain, Australia and Canada, 1919‚Äì1939, David William Lloyd discusses Traynor as part of an interwar phenomenon of mass pilgrimage, with large numbers of British ex-servicemen making pilgrimages both to the replica of Lourdes at the Carfin Grotto and to Lourdes itself. Upon his return to Liverpool, a crowd had assembled at Lime Street station to greet his arrival. John started a coal delivery business and returned to Lourdes as a stretcher bearer. He was one of the pre-war Presidents of the Liverpool Brancardiers Association. Despite this story, he is not listed amongst the verified Lourdes cures.Lourdes-France.org http://www.lourdes- france.org/upload/pdf/gb_guerisons.pdfGarner, Jim. \\"Spontaneous regressions: scientific documentation as a basis for the declaration of miracles.\\" Canadian Medical Association Journal 111, no. 11 (1974): 1254. The British Army refused to consider withdrawing his invalidity pensions awarded to him after he was originally wounded. Believers in Lourdes have identified John Traynor as the closest a British or Irish invalid has ever gotten to being officially pronounced a Lourdes miracle. In the context of Catholicism in Victorian England, various believers had identified him as the first British Catholic to be cured at Lourdes.Mary Heimann, Catholic Devotion in Victorian England (Clarendon Press 1995): p. 53. . According to Patrick Marnham, \\"Wherever two or three British pilgrims are gathered together the story of John Traynor will sooner or later be told.\\" In his lighthearted 2009 book, Detour De France: An Englishman in Search of a Continental Education, actor Michael Simkins visits Lourdes, describing Traynor as the \\"most famous\\" English pilgrim to claim a cure at the shrine.

Their keyboard or speech recognition software is linked to a computer, which converts this information to properly spelled words. The reproduced text could then be read by deaf or hard-of-hearing people. The latest in speech-to-text reporters are called Voice writers. Voicewriting is a method used for court reporting, and it is also used by some medical transcriptionists. Using the voicewriting method, a court reporter speaks directly into a stenomask or voice silencer‚Äîa hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and voice-dampening materials. A voice writing system consists of a stenomask, an external sound digitizer, a laptop, speech recognition software, and CAT software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port. A real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers. Voice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology. The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and \\"inner\\" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from \\"inner voice\\" to the physiological \\"spoken voice.\\" Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute. Voice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with computer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing. Other ways of producing speech-to-text: There are two types of keyboard used in the UK: the Palantype system and the Stenograph system. Hence STTRs are also sometimes referred to as palantypists and stenographers. Unlike a QWERTY keyboard, not every letter in a word is pressed, but several keys will be pressed at once which represent whole words, phrases or shortforms. Specially designed computer software will then convert these phonetic chords back into English which can then be displayed for someone to read. The computer software can use a pre-programmed vocabulary specific to the context, information that matches syllable clusters to written forms, and may suggest alternative captions from which the STTR chooses. Errors occur from the STTR mishearing the words and from the need for the STTR to make a decision before an ambiguous statement is made clear by what is said next. The professional association for STTRs is the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters. The Council for Advanced Communication with Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf also give more information about STTRs.  What will a service user see on the screen?  Every word that is spoken will appear on the screen in an accessible format, although one can request a change in the color and font size. As well as every word spoken, the words \\"NEW SPEAKER:\\" will typically appear to denote when the speaker changes. If one sends the STTR (voice writer/palantypist/stenographer) the names of people attending the conference or meeting before the event, they, too, can be programmed into the computer, making it easier for one to recognize who is speaking. Other phrases, in curly brackets, may also appear, such as {laughter} or {applause}, to denote relevant events. Occasional mondegreen errors may be seen in closed- captions when the computer software fails to distinguish where a word break occurs in the syllable stream. For example, a news report of a \\"grand parade\\" might be captioned as a \\"grandpa raid\\". Mondegreens in this context arise from the need for captions to keep up with the fast pace of live television broadcasts.  History  Many STTRs began their careers as court reporters. In the courts, the system was used to record proceedings and provide transcripts when requested. The skills developed in this area have also made them invaluable in the field of communication with deaf people, as they are used to producing work with an extremely high degree of accuracy and acting with complete discretion at all times. An STTR expects to reach consistent levels of accuracy of 98.5% and above.  Training  In order to become an STTR one needs extensive training, typically two years, if a Palantype/Stenograph and the associated software, plus at least a further two years of practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience. If becoming a voice writing STTR, the training is somewhat shorter, though nevertheless, just as strenuous. Two years to learn the art of voice writing includes the associated software and required practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience. Only then is one ready to undertake the USA and/or UK Examinations for Certification. In the USA, NVRA and NCRA offer certifications that demonstrate the necessary training. There are many levels of certification. NVRA certifies voice writers as court reporters, realtime reporters, CART providers, and broadcast captioners. Beyond any licensing considerations, NVRA certification clearly demonstrates that the voice writer has attained a level of professionalism and skill well above that of others in the field. The NVRA certification testing program is available to all members. Tests are held at regular intervals throughout the year in various locations across the country. In the UK, Unitised CACDP Examinations and membership with the CACDP Register, confirms that one has reached the required minimum standard. The majority of Registered STTRs are also Members of the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters.

It is the principal monastery of the Nizhny Novgorod Eparchy (diocese) and the seat of the Bishop of Nizhny Novgorod and Arzamas.  History  Pechersky Voznesensky Monastery is usually said to have been founded ca. 1328-1330 by St. Dionysius, who came to Nizhny Novgorod from Kiev Pechersk Lavra (i.e., Kiev Monastery of the Caves, pechery meaning 'caves') with several other monks, and dug for himself a cave on the step Volga shore some 3 km southeast of the city. Later on, he founded at that site a monastery with a church of Resurrection of the Lord. The monastery soon became an important spiritual and religious center of the Principality of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod. The monastery was destroyed by a landslide on June 18, 1597; surprisingly, no one died. The same year the monastery was rebuilt about 1 km upstream (north) of the old site. Although there are no caves in the modern monastery, the appellation Pechersky, linking it to the old Kiev cloister, has been preserved. Moreover, the entire section of Nizhny Novgorod surrounding the monastery, occupying the uplands above the Volga south of the city center, is known as Pechery. The monastery was closed by the NKVD in 1924, and reopened in 1994.  Principal buildings  In the refectory section of the Ascension Cathedral The principal buildings of the monastery include: * Ascension Cathedral (–í–æ–∑–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ–±–æ—Ä), constructed in 1630‚Äî1632. * The Church of Dormition of Our Lady (–£—Å–ø–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å), 1648. * The Church of Saint Venerable Euthimios of Suzdal, built over the monastery's inner gate (–ù–∞–¥–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω–∞—è —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å –≤–æ –∏–º—è —Å–≤. –ø—Ä–µ–ø. –ï–≤—Ñ–∏–º–∏—è –°—É–∑–¥–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ), 1645. * The Church of SS Peter and Paul (–¶–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å –≤–æ –∏–º—è —Å–≤. –∞–ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≤ –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–∞ –∏ –ü–∞–≤–ª–∞), 1738. * Bishop's residence (–∞—Ä—Ö–∏–µ—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–∞–ª–∞—Ç—ã), 1632. * Hegumen's building (–∏–≥—É–º–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å), 1765. * Monks' residence (–±—Ä–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å), 17th century. The belfry of the Ascension Cathedral (which also serves as a clock tower) is noticeably out of plumb. It has been leaning almost since the time it was originally constructed. The monastery is surrounded by a red brick wall with small towers, making it look like a small kremlin. The diocesan archeological museum and a book and icon shop operate in the monastery. In the latter, one can request a variety of prayers for the living and dead, in accordance with the posted fee list. Holy relics * In 2006-2007, the monastery housed an important relic known as the Honorable Head (i.e., skull) of the Venerable Macarius. It was solemnly transferred to Makaryev Monastery in 2007.

Career Jones was born in Tipton, Staffordshire. He played for Smethwick Town and for Birmingham & District League club Halesowen before turning professional with Small Heath, newly promoted to the Football League First Division, in 1901. He was their leading scorer for four successive seasons, from 1903‚Äì04 to 1906‚Äì07,Matthews, pp. 150‚Äì53. and his performances were rewarded in 1904 with selection for the Football League representative team which played against the Irish Football League.Matthews, p. 246. Jones then suffered a series of injuries, the team's form declined, and, believing the player to be past his best, the club, now named Birmingham, released him at the end of the 1908‚Äì09 season. Jones joined Brighton & Hove Albion of the Southern League. He was top scorer for that club in both his full seasons, with 22 and 19 goals respectively in all competitions.Carder & Harris, Albion A‚ÄìZ, p. 338. He contributed to them winning the 1910 Southern League championship and the 1910 FA Charity Shield, in which they beat Aston Villa, champions of the Football League, and scored the winning goal in the 1910 Southern Professional Charity Cup. Nevertheless, when Birmingham wanted to re- sign him in January 1912, the form of Jimmy Smith meant that Albion's directors were willing to let him go for a ¬£300 fee. Jones again top-scored for Birmingham in 1912‚Äì13,Matthews, p. 159. bringing his total for the club to 102 goals from 253 appearances in all competitions, before returning to Brighton in the summer. In October 1914, Jones played for a Southern League representative team against the Scottish League; the game, played at Millwall's ground in London, finished as a 1‚Äì1 draw.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 322. By January 1915, Jones, like many of his teammates, had enlisted in the Football Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. They trained at the White City in London, were released at weekends to play for their clubs,Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 68. and Jones finished the season ‚Äì the last completed before the Football League was suspended for the duration of the First World War ‚Äì as Albion's top scorer for the third time. He returned to the club after the war, played his last competitive first-team match in December 1919, at the age of 38 years and 271 days,Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 320. and continued to appear occasionally for the reserves until as late as 1927. He performed various roles for the club, as assistant trainer, scout and groundsman. He retired after the death of his wife in 1947, and the following March, he died in hospital after being discovered in a gas-filled room.

Landmarks and notable buildings=Llanharan House On the outskirts of Llanharan, overlooking the village, sits Llanharan House. It was built in 1750 by Rees Powell and stayed with the Powell family until 1795 upon which it was purchased by Richard Hoare Jenkins. Hoare Jenkins was a High Sheriff of Glamorgan and he was involved in the suppression of the Merthyr Rising of 1831, and is recorded as stating he found the execution of Dic Penderyn as the most difficult of his civic duties. Around 1800 some major improvements were made to the house with the addition of a three-storey circular stair hall which includes a dramatic geometrical staircase.Glamorgan County History, Volume VI, Glamorgan Society 1780-1980; Prys Morgan, University of Wales Press, Cardiff (1988)pg. 402 Following the death of Hoare Jenkins in 1856 the house and the estate was passed to a Colonel John Blandy-Jenkins. Following his death in 1915 Colonel Blandy-Jenkins's wife kept the house until 1953. 'Llanharran Hunt' (1840) Llanharan house has a strong historical connection with fox hunting. This Welsh pack was named The Llanharan and was established by Richard Hoare Jenkins in 1805, though the pack was renamed the Llangeinor during the period when Mr John Blandy Jenkins was the squire.Foxhounds of Great Britain and Ireland and their Masters and Huntsmen, written by Sir Humphrey F. de Trafford, published in 1905. The Llangeinor is now based in Coity near Bridgend. Llanharan House is a Grade II listed building.United Kingdom Database of Historic Parks and Gardens The Church of St Julius and Aaron The local parish church is the Church of St Julius and Aaron whose interior was redesigned in its present form by neo-gothic architect John Prichard around 1856,Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire & South Wales, 1895 with work completed by 1859. The restoration work was financed by the Jenkins family of Llanharan House.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) University of Wales Press pg500 Llanharan Town Square Llanharan Town square consists of several historical stone buildings situated by the local river the Ewenny Fach. Llanharan town square is dominated by a public house called The High Corner which dates back to roughly 1700. Outside the High Corner is an original red telephone box which was adopted by Llanharan Community Council in 2017. The adoption secured this iconic piece of British history. Work is ongoing to renovate the box which now is home to a defibrillator. Employment Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, Llanharan was a small agricultural village, and this was reflected in the 1851 census where a population of 330 people living in 62 buildings was recorded. In 1850 the South Wales Railway had opened a station in Llanharan making it a strategic location for surrounding industries. Later employment came from the nearby iron mines in Llanharry and Pontyclun. Towards the end of the 19th century an additional 80 houses had been built and Llanharan had a population of over a thousand. With the discovery of coal an attempt to sink two mine shafts began between 1870 and 1873, but the work was eventually abandoned as the pit was too wet and inclined.Witt (1988), pg 86 In the early 1880s, in a different location to the first sinking attempt, the first deep mine in Llanharan was opened, the Meiros Colliery. The Meiros was listed in 1888 as owned by the Llanharan Welsh Estate of Cardiff; employing 228 men.Witt (1988), pg 60 The Meiros shaft was 200 yards deep and it mined the No. 3 seam (Rhondda). Meiros Collieries Ltd took over the colliery in 1913, and in 1915 the colliery underwent considerable modernisation. At its peak in 1923, the colliery was employing 622 men. The Meiros Colliery closed in the 1930s. The Powell Duffryn Company restarted the sinking of the original steam coal seams abandoned in the early 1880s in 1922. This was named the Llanharan Colliery and consisted of two pits, Llanharan North and South pits which in 1945 employed a total of 855 and 775 men respectively. Output form the colliery was at its highest in the early and mid-1950s, producing over 234,000 tons of coal in 1952. From 1959 production began to fall sharply, and in 1962 Llanharan Colliery was closed down.Witt (1988), pg 80 From 1900 until the Powell Duffryn's Llanharn colliery closed in 1962, the area westward along the Bridgend Road became the commercial heart of a relatively flourishing mining village that survived even the depression years. Since the 1970s the residents of Llanharan have become more reliant on commuting to work as local employment reduces. Local amenities have also closed over the years including Llanharan's cinema, railway station (which reopened in 2007) and the library. In 2015 a new source of work came with the building of a set for the filming of the medieval drama The Bastard Executioner. Arts and entertainment In 1997 Llanharan rugby ground was used in the box office smash film Up 'n' Under which is a 1998 film adaptation of the John Godber play of the same title. Education There are two Primary Schools presently serving the community of Llanharan, they are Ysgol Dolau Primary School which is a bilingual school teaching through the medium of Welsh and English and also Llanharan Primary School. Both are Green flag award school's.  Transport  Llanharan is served by many buses and also Llanharan railway station, which reopened in December 2007 after 43 years of closure. The main road running through Llanharan is the A473 Bridgend Road, linking Bridgend to its west and Talbot Green to its east.  Sports = Llanharan RFC  The village hosts a Rugby Football team, Llanharan Rugby Football Club, who play in the Welsh Rugby Union Championship Division. The club formed in 1891 and was awarded membership to the WRU in 1919. Llanharan RFC play in black shirts and shorts with three light blue horizontal hoops across the chest. Their nickname, the \\"Black and Blues\\", is taken from their colours. Their home ground is named The Dairyfield, and there is also another pitch available to the clubs disposal, The Welfare Ground. Group matches for the 1991 Women's Rugby World Cup were played at The Dairyfield.  South Wales Warriors  As of the 2009 season, The Dairy Field in Llanharan has been the home field of the South Wales Warriors American Football team. The Warriors play in the Western Conference of Division Two of the British American Football Association National Leagues, the primary American Football league of the United Kingdom. Welsh Springer Spaniel It is thought that the breed of dog, the Welsh Springer Spaniel, either found its origins or was historically successfully bred in Llanharan. Some breeders speak of the ‚ÄúLlanharan Spot‚Äù, if one describes the red point in the middle on the head of the Welsh. The Llanharan Spaniel makes up part of the Llanharan RFC club badge.

The station stands on the Hutt Valley section of the Wairarapa Line, north of Wellington. Trains stopping at Waterloo run to Wellington, Taita, Upper Hutt and Masterton, as well as to points in between. Waterloo serves as a major bus-rail interchange, connecting buses to and from central Lower Hutt, Naenae and Wainuiomata with trains to and from Wellington.  History  Waterloo station in 1950, looking south. Two major reasons were the impetus for the construction of the Hutt Valley Branch between Petone and Waterloo: first, the Petone Workshops had reached the end of their useful life; second, with increasing traffic demands on the line between Petone and Haywards and the lack of room to double-track the line on its existing route meant a new mainline had to be built. The line was surveyed between 1924 and 1925, with a short industrial branch leaving the Hutt Valley Branch at Woburn to serve the new Hutt Workshops. On 26 May 1927 the rails reached Waterloo, which was then in the middle of open fields. This station was the terminus of the Hutt Valley Branch line until an extension north to Naenae was opened in 1946. The station was opened with automatic, three-aspect colour light signals which had been standard since 1924. It was always intended that Waterloo would one day serve a major population centre which, in the years following World War II and the population boom that ensued, was proved correct. Significant urban development of the Hutt Valley in the 1940s led to the decision in February 1946 to commence electrification in 1949 and to operate electric train between Waterloo and Wellington from August 1953. Until the connection of the Hutt Valley Branch to the Wairarapa Line and its opening as the new mainline on 1 March 1954, Waterloo served only suburban passenger services, with Upper Hutt and Wairarapa trains continuing to use the old line between Haywards and Petone on the western side of the Hutt Valley. In 1986, as a result of the Hutt Valley Transport Study, Waterloo was designated an interchange for bus and rail services in preference to Woburn, which had previously had this role. It was felt that Waterloo was a more logical choice as it was closer to centres of residential and commercial interest, had sufficient room for bus platforms to be installed, and was not burdened with other operational requirements such as Woburn being the junction with the Gracefield Branch, with its loops and sidings. The new interchange facility at Waterloo was opened on 26 November 1988 and fully integrated with all the new public transport routes and timetables by the following March.  Services =Rail Transdev Wellington, on behalf of the Greater Wellington Regional Council, operates Hutt Valley Line electric suburban services between Wellington and Upper Hutt via Waterloo. It also operates the Wairarapa Connection diesel-hauled service between Wellington and Masterton via Waterloo. The basic daytime off-peak timetable is: *3 trains per hour (tph) Hutt Valley Line services to Wellington, stopping all stations. *3 tph Hutt Valley Line services to Upper Hutt, stopping all stations. *Two Wairarapa Connection services to Wellington, stopping Petone only. *Two Wairarapa Connection services to Masterton, stopping all stations from Upper Hutt. The basic morning peak timetable is: *6 tph Hutt Valley Line to Wellington, split: **3 tph stopping all stations to Petone **3 tph non-stop *2 tph Hutt Valley Line to Upper Hutt, stopping all stations *Three Wairarapa Connection services to Wellington, stopping Petone only. Bus Metlink bus routes 121, 130, 150, 160 and 170 serve Waterloo.  References Further reading  External links * Passenger service timetables from Metlink and Tranz Metro.

The body has provided financial assistance to historians and scholars through fellowships, grants, and symposia. The ICHR receives grants-in-aid from the Department of Higher Education, grants-in-aid from various Indian states, private donations, and the proceeds of revenues from the sale of publications of the ICHR. The ICHR is based in Delhi, with regional centres in Pune (Maharashtra), Bengaluru (Karnataka), and Guwahati (Assam). Its first chairman was the historian Ram Sharan Sharma nominated as its first chairman. Historians who have served as members or functionaries of the ICHR include Irfan Habib, Tapan Raychaudhuri, and Barun De. Objectives The objectives of the ICHR, as enunciated in the initial pamphlet published by the Department of Education, Government of India in 1972, are as under: * to bring historians together and provide a forum for exchange of views between them; * to give a national direction to an objective and scientific writing of history and to have rational presentation and interpretation of history; * to promote, accelerate and coordinate research in history with special emphasis on areas which have not received adequate attention so far; * to promote and coordinated a balanced distribution of research effort over different areas; and * to elicit support and recognition for historical research from all concerned and ensure the necessary dissemination and use of results. Funding, expenses and salaries ICHR is funded by grants-in-aid received from the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development. It also receives funds from the various state governments of India and from other Ministries of the government of India. Organization The ICHR is headed by an Honorary Chairman. The Member Secretary functions as the Secretary of the Governing Council during its General Body and special meetings and as the day-to-day Head of the Department in ICHR. The Members of the Council of ICHR (Governing Body) are nominated for a period of three years. The Chairman of the Council of ICHR is nominated by the Department of Education in an honorary capacity and his term is not co-terminus with that of the members of the Constituted Council. The day-to-day functioning of the ICHR is looked after the Director who acts as ex officio Member Secretary of the Council. In 1991, a trend was started to have a separate post of Member Secretary of the ICHR, with Professor MGS Narayanan being selected as the First Member Secretary of ICHR. The institution has been continually embroiled in intra-rivalries between the Chairmen, Member Secretaries and the Directors, at the cost of historical research. The main reason, as per many, has been the deputing of persons from here and there as the Member Secretaries and the undermining the office of the Chairman and the Director of the institution.

History Sacred Heart Girls' College was founded by the Sisters of Our Lady of the Missions (RNDMs) in 1957, built on the wonderful traditions of their founder, Euphrasie Barbier. It was she who had a dream \\"that all people would be loved, honoured and respected for the wonderful gifts of their difference and the amazing gifts of our oneness\\". Crest=Crown The crown symbolises a reward for excellence. It is mentioned several times in the Christian Scriptures as a reward for those who have persevered in doing right. (1 Peter 5:4; 2 Tim 4: 6‚Äì8; Revelations 2: 10) The palm/laurel branches The palm or laurel branches symbolise victory. In ancient times the winner of a race was given a laurel wreath in recognition of their victory; at Jesus‚Äô triumphant entry to Jerusalem, the crowds waved palm branches as a sign of his coming victory over death. We are reminded that our lives can be seen as a struggle to win the prize of victory given to us when we uphold our Christian faith. The leaves of our crest are symbolic of reward and victory. St. Paul reminds us that we should not make material rewards our only goal but strive towards eternal and spiritual rewards. Shield The shield signifies protection. The training and ideals imparted to us during our College life will act as armour and be a source of strength in our future lives. (Eph 6:10‚Äì23; Ps, 5: 13.) The letters V and K stand for Virtue and Knowledge which reminds us that learning is important but even more important is our living out of our Christian ideals. The letters S and H stand for the Sacred Heart, symbolising the great love that Jesus has for us all, and that we should strive to spread that love to others. Scroll In ancient times, any important document was written on a scroll. Hence our motto and the name of our College are written on scrolls to emphasise their importance. The College motto is \\"Semper Superne Nitens\\" which means 'Always Striving Upwards'. Every student is encouraged to strive towards higher standards ‚Äì in spiritual development and a closer familiarity with God, in personal behaviour and character development, and in pursuit of higher academic standards. House teams Interhouse competitions remain an integral part of the College's ethos. The four Houses with their associated colours are:  * The names for the Houses were derived from the traditions and heritage of the RNDM. The students are placed into one of the Houses upon starting at the College. The House teams participate in sporting events, such as annual swimming carnivals, athletics carnivals and house netball & cross country competitions. The Houses also participate in a House arts festival, in which each House exhibits performances relating to song, dance and acting for the College. Bede The Bede House colour is red. Bede House was named in honour of Mother Mary St. Bede. She was a pioneer member of the congregation in England and a great educator who gave constant encouragement to the Sisters during their difficult years when establishing a school in Western Australia. Paul The Paul House colour is gold. Paul House was named in honour of Paul the Apostle. He was fired with great missionary spirit and used sporting examples as a picture of the Christian life. In 1 Corinthians 9:24‚Äì26, he challenges us not just to race, but to race to win, saying, \\"Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air.\\" Trinity The Trinity House colour is blue. Trinity House is named in honour to the Trinity; the existence of God as three divine persons: the Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. Although they operate according to their own unique properties, at the same time, they commonly operate grace and creation; a symbol for harmony and teamwork. Xavier The Xavier House colour is emerald green. Xavier House was named in honour of Francis Xavier by Sister Mary Clement who was a sports mistress. The missionary Francis Xavier had three virtues: a great desire to bring souls to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, an heroic obedience, and a great spirit of sacrifice. He is the patron of missionaries in foreign lands, and of Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan. Daily program Every school day comprises five periods of sixty-five minutes, a recess break, a morning and an afternoon homeroom, and a lunch break. The school operates on a fortnightly timetable. As of 2013, a largely student-fought initiative led to all students being allocated a well-being session one period a fortnight. School commences at 8:30 am every day and concludes at 3:15 pm.

Curriculum Each learner must study English First Language and either Afrikaans or Zulu First Additional Language, and Mathematics or Mathematical Literacy. Facilities Northwood's sporting facilities include rugby union, soccer and cricket fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, volleyball courts, two rock climbing walls and a number of other specialised sporting centres.  History  Northwood traces its origins back to the founding of the co-educational Durban North High School on the site of the present Northlands Girls' High School in September 1949. It started with 12 staff members and 215 pupils under Headmaster, Mr George J. Armstrong. By 1951, numbers had grown so rapidly that it was decided to build a second high school in Durban North, and split the existing school into a boys' school and a girls' school. On 30 September 1953, the Northwood campus in Kensington Drive was opened. Northlands Boys' High School opened with 338 boys and 17 staff members, under Mr Percy Hardaker (1953‚Äì1962) and thereafter Mr McFarquar (1963‚Äì1974). Numbers continued to grow, requiring the building of yet another boys' school in the area. The new Beachwood Boys' High School opened in Gleneagles Drive in 1963 with 135 boys and 7 staff members under Headmaster Mr E.T. (Ted) Lewis. Other headmasters at Beachwood were HM Puzey, KL Tomlinson, MJ Ellis and CW Thorpe. At the end of 1971, Mr. Lewis retired from Beachwood and was succeeded by Mr. A.J.M. Wilkinson. In 1975, he became Headmaster of Northlands Boys' High. The thaw in the relationship between the two schools had begun, but rivalry continued. During 1989 it was proposed that, for economic reasons, the two boys' schools in Durban North merge to form a single school. In 1990 Beachwood and Northlands merged to form Northwood. It was possible, with an adjustment of colours, to merge the school badges and retain both mottoes. Ian Corbishley was made Headmaster of the combined school until 1996, when Dr P. Hawkey acted as Headmaster until Mr A.P. Jordan succeeded him during 1998. Upon the retirement of Mr. Jordan at the end of 2012, Mr. P.L. McAvoy took over the post in 2013.

Although the natives of the region knew it as Mazandaran, the region was called Tabaristan since the Sassanid era. Early history The Amardians are believed to have been the earliest inhabitants of the region where modern day Mazanderan and Gilan are located. The establishment of the early great kingdom dates back to about the first millennium BCE when the Hyrcanian kingdom was founded with Sadracarta (somewhere near modern Sari) as its capital. Its extent was so large that for centuries the Caspian Sea was called the Hyrcanian Ocean. The first known dynasty were the Faratatians, who ruled some centuries before Christ. During the rise of the Parthians, many of the Amerdians were forced into exile to the southern slopes of the Alborz mountains known today as Varamin and Garmsar, and the Tabaris (who were then living somewhere between today's Yaneh Sar to the north and Shahrud to the south) replaced them in the region. During the indigenous Gushnaspian dynasty, many of the people adopted Christianity. In 418 CE, the Tapurian calendar (similar to the Armenian and Galeshi) was designed and its use implemented. The Gashnaspians ruled the region until 528 CE, when, after a long period of fighting, the Sasanian King Kavadh I defeated the last Gashnaspian king. Medieval era Silver gilt dish of Tapuria, 7th‚Äì8th centuries. A tradition initiated under the Sasanians and continued after the Arab invasions. \\"Anuzhad\\" inscription in Pahlavi script, next to the reclining figure. British Museum. When the Sasanian Empire fell, Yazdegerd III ordered Adhar Valash to cede the dominion to spahbed Gil Gavbara in 645 CE, while western and Southern Gilan and other parts of Gil's domain merged under the name of Tapuria. He then chose Amol as capital of United Tapuria in 647 CE. The dynasty of Gil was known as Gavbareh in Gilan, and as the Dabuyids in eastern Tapuria. Mazandaranis and Gilaks were among the first groups of Iranians to fight against the Arab invasion. Tabaristan was one of the last parts of Persia to fall to the Muslim Conquest, maintaining resistance until 761 (cf. Khurshid of Tabaristan), when local rulers became vassals of the Abbasid Caliphate. Even after this, Tabaristan remained largely independent of direct control of the Caliphate, and underwent numerous power struggles and rebellions. In the early 9th century, for example, a Zoroastrian by the name of Mazyar rebelled, taking control of Tabaristan and persecuting Muslims there before his ultimate execution in 839. After this rebellion, the territory was largely restored to the control of the Bavand dynasty, who ruled there as vassals of various successive empires, including the Seljuks, Kwarezmshah, and Mongols. The area of Tabaristan quickly gained a large Shi'ite element, and by 900, a Zaydi Shi'ite kingdom was established under the Alavids. In 930, a Zoroastrian commander named Mardavij established the Ziyarid dynasty and briefly conquered much of northern Persia before being betrayed and killed in 935 CE. The Ziyarid dynasty continued to rule over much of Tabaristan until its demise in 1090 CE. While the Dabuyids controlled the lowlands, the Sokhrayans governed the mountain regions. Vandad Hormozd ruled the region for about 50 years until 1034 CE. After 1125 CE, (the year Maziar was assassinated by subterfuge) an increase in conversion to Islam was achieved, not by the Arab Caliphs, but by the Imam's ambassadors. Modern era Tapuria remained independent until 1596, when Shah Abbas I, Mazandarani on his mother's side, incorporated Mazandaran into his Safavid empire, forcing many Armenians, Circassians, Georgians, Kurds and Qajar Turks to settle in Mazandaran. Pietro della Valle, who visited a town near Pirouzcow in Mazandaran in 1618, noted that Mazandarani women never wore the veil and didn't hesitate to talk to foreigners. He also noted the extremely large amount of Circassians and Georgians in the region, and that he had never encountered people with as much civility as the Mazandaranis. After the Safavid period, the Qajars began to campaign south from Mazandaran with Agha Mohammad Khan who already incorporated Mazandaran into his empire in 1782. On 21 March 1782, Agha Mohammad Shah proclaimed Sari as his imperial capital. Sari was the site of local wars in those years, which led to the transfer of the capital from Sari to Tehran by Fath Ali Shah. References Sources  * Inostranzev, M.

The ad firm hired by Elizabeth Arden to create the perfume brand copied several features of original Mondonation mark, in use since 2005, including the unique color scheme and several typographic features. A letter-writing campaign to the fragrance company drew widespread attention to the 'design plagiarism' of the Britney brand. In an article by Fiona Anderson published in the Vancouver Sun, it was revealed that the vice- president of Elizabeth Arden had contacted Mondonation as a result of the letter-writing campaign and indicated there would be negotiations to resolve the issue.

Career Keddie made his debut for Hawthorn in 1965 and in the subsequent seasons became a highly effective half forward flanker for the club. He was Hawthorn's Best & Fairest winner in 1967 and 1969 and for his performances at the 1969 Adelaide Carnival for Victoria he earned All Australian selection. In 1967 Keddie was selected in the first Australian Team to tour Ireland and the USA to play Gaelic Football. During the 1970 VFL season Keddie kicked 47 goals for the year. He was overshadowed, however, by teammate Peter Hudson who kicked 146 goals. In the 1971 VFL Grand Final against St Kilda, Hawthorn were down by 20 points when Keddie was pushed to full forward (and Hudson to centre half forward). They went on to win the game by seven points, with Keddie kicking four final-quarter goals and gaining hero status. In the week prior a church billboard in the team's eponymous home suburb carried the question \\"What would you do if Christ came to Hawthorn?\\", to which some wag had added \\"Move Peter Hudson to Centre Half-Forward\\". Thus Hawthorn fans regarded this move, when it actually happened during the game, as a good omen and Bob Keddie as a sort of saviour. Keddie worked as a physical education teacher in the Victorian State School system at Belle Vue State school and is responsible for a strong cadre of \\"Hawks\\" from that generation. Keddie left Hawthorn at the end of the 1972 VFL season and became captain and coach of West Adelaide. Keddie played 18 games, kicking 14 goals and winning The Bloods Best & Fairest before moving on to South Adelaide as captain in 1974, playing 53 games, kicking 71 goals and winning South's Best and Fairest in 1975. In 1977 Keddie played a final season with Glenelg, playing seven games and kicking two goals. During this time Keddie also played five games for South Australiaagainst Victoria (3), Western Australia (1) and Tasmania (1), kicking four goals. Post playing In 1979 Keddie became the state development manager for the Junior Football Council of Victoria (governed by the AFL) and set up parent groups throughout Victoria to initiate what is known as 'AUSKICK'. In 1981 he became the full-time development manager for the Hawthorn FC. before returning to teaching at Wesley College in 1984. Keddie was appointed as an assistant coach to Allan Jeans in 1980 and coached Hawthorn Under 19s team. In 1984 Keddie was appointed as senior coach at Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Sandringham. He coached them to the 1985 flag. In 1987 Keddie was appointed as David Parkins' senior assistant coach before returning to Sandringham in 1988. He continued his teaching career into the 1980s, teaching primary at Wesley College until 1987. In 1991‚Äì93 Keddie coached South Launceston Football Club in the Tasmanian Football League. This is where his only child, Alexandra Keddie (born 1992), was born. He now resides back in Melbourne and is currently retired, but does some coaching work and player mentoring at the Frankston Football Club.

Early life Polemon was Anatolian Greek and originally came from a family of Roman consular rank. He was born in Laodicea on the Lycus in Phrygia (modern Turkey), however, he spent a great part of his life in Smyrna (modern ƒ∞zmir, Turkey). From early manhood, he received civic honors from the citizens of Smyrna for his services to the city. Career Polemon was a master of rhetoric, a prominent member of the Second Sophistic. He was favored by several Roman Emperors. Trajan is said to have granted him the privilege of free travel wherever he wished; Hadrian extended that privilege to Polemon's posterity.G.W. Bowersock, Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969), p. 48 Hadrian not only admitted he ruled with Polemon's advice, but Polemon accompanied the emperor during his travels in Greece and Asia Minor.The path of this travel is detailed in Bowersock, Greek Sophists, pp.120-123 When his enemies accused Polemon of spending funds Hadrian had given him to benefit the city of Smyrna, the emperor defended the sophist with a letter declaring that Polemon had rendered Hadrian an account of the moneys entrusted to him. Polemon gave the dedicatory oration to Hadrian's Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens, which G.W. Bowersock speculates was \\"an embarrassing repudiation of the obvious person for the occasion, Herodes Atticus. There is a famous story of his arrogant behavior towards Antoninus Pius, whom he threw out of his house at midnight when Antoninus was the newly arrived Governor of Asia.Bowersock, Greek Sophists, pp. 48f Polemon was the head of one of the foremost schools of rhetorics of the Hellenistic culture in Smyrna. His style of oratory was imposing rather than pleasing; however his character was haughty and reserved. Later life In his later years, Polemon suffered from arthritis. At the age of 56 and no longer able to stand the pain, he ordered his servants to lock him in his family tomb. When his friends and family begged him not to commit suicide in this manner, he said, \\"Give me another body and I shall come forth.\\" There, he most likely died from either starvation or dehydration.Suda œÄ 1889 Works The only fully surviving works of Polemon are his funeral orations for the Athenians generals Callimachus and Cynaegirus, who died at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. These orations are titled logoi epitaphioi (epitaphs). His rhetorical compositions were subjects that were taken from Athenian history. A treatise on physiognomy is preserved in a 14th-century Arabic translation.Published with a Latin translation in Polemonis de Physiognomonia liber arabice et latine, ed. G. Hoffmann, in R.

Music Highly influenced by Thelonious Monk, Nalbandian performs jazz, free and avant-garde jazz, improvised and experimental music. While his primary ensemble is the Armen Nalbandian Trio, he has led more than 30 different ensembles and composed over 1200 works ranging from music for string quartets, chamber music, orchestral music, electronic music, scores for theater, experimental hiphop, 'Conduction' pieces inspired by Butch Morris' approach, new Japanese and Armenian inspired folk music, and John Zorn inspired \\"game pieces\\" in addition to having performed a solo piano concert of Zorn's Masada music with the encouragement and blessing of the composer. His groups include the Armen Nalbandian Trio (with Eric Revis and Nasheet Waits), Armen Nalbandian V (with Jeff Parker Chris Speed, Eric Revis, and Alex Cline), and the Armen Nalbandian 3 (with Steve Lehman and Guillermo E. Brown). He cites witnessing a Cecil Taylor performance at LA's Jazz Bakery when he was 19 years old as a turning point in his life and career. He is the protege of jazz pianist John Hicks but also credits Bill Dixon and McCoy Tyner for being important teachers in addition to Charlie Haden, Jackie McLean, Horace Silver, Cedar Walton, Billy Higgins, Art Farmer, and Harold Land. Nalbandian has worked with Billy Higgins, Han Bennink, Eric Revis, Nasheet Waits, Bennie Maupin, Jeff Parker, Chris Speed, Steve Lehman, Guillermo E. Brown, Derek Keller, Marvin \\"Smitty\\" Smith, Tony Dumas, Carl Allen, and Alex Cline.

In 2017, Nalbandian premiered two new ensembles to add to his work with his trio with Eric Revis and Nasheet Waits and his solo piano work. The first, a new quintet named Armen Nalbandian V featuring Chris Speed, Jeff Parker, Eric Revis & Alex Cline and the Armen Nalbandian 3 with Steve Lehman & Guillermo E. Brown; loosely inspired by Cecil Taylor's trio with Jimmy Lyons and Andrew Cyrille.

Nalbandian's composition \\"Need\\" is dedicated to memory of pianist Kenny Kirkland. Manchester Born Manchester Born was released in November 2007 and features The Armen Nalbandian Trio. This was Armen Nalbandian's debut recording on the Fender Rhodes. The recording consists of ten compositions by Nalbandian and is dedicated to his mentor John Hicks, and in memory of Alice Coltrane and Andrew Hill. Young Kings Get Their Heads Cut Off Initially inspired by avant-garde drummer Chris Corsano's solo drum album The Young Cricketer and the music of Ikue Mori, Armen Nalbandian's first solo recording was named after a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat and features Nalbandian on the \\"prepared\\" Fender Rhodes. The recording was made by Nalbandian performing primarily on the inside of the Fender Rhodes, treating it as a percussion instrument, manipulating the hammers with drum cymbals, snare drum heads, wrenches, mallets, and keys. Nalbandian also employed an analog delay pedal and a wah-wah pedal. The recording is completely improvised with the exception of the composition \\"Blues to Steve Lacy\\", which was composed by trumpeter Dave Douglas. The sound of the album has elicit comparisons to Miles Davis' Bitches Brew and John Cage's prepared piano music. The album has been featured heavily on WFMU, called by Rolling Stone Magazine, The Village Voice, CMJ and the New York Press as \\"the best radio station in the country.\\" Tirez Sur Le Pianiste & To Repel Ghosts To Repel Ghosts is an experimental electronic production and live album comprising eleven compositions by Nalbandian. The album is Nalbandian's second recording named after the work of artist Jean- Michel Basquiat. To Repel Ghosts was Nalbandian's first digital-only album, released exclusively on the artist's website in its first year. Nalbandian's album Tirez Sur Le Pianiste (Shoot the Piano Player) was released nine months before and includes three compositions that also appear on To Repel Ghosts. The music on both albums has been compared to Kid A/Amnesiac-era Radiohead and the LA beat scene. Coup de Grace On August 23, 2011, Nalbandian released two distinctly different albums. The first, Coup de Grace, is a live recording featuring Nalbandian on piano and drummer Han Bennink in an improvised duet setting. Bennink, perhaps best known as one of the pivotal figures in early European free jazz and free improvisation, is the co-founder of the Instant Composers Pool (ICP). Nalbandian and Bennink conclude the performance with a rendition of Ornette Coleman's \\"Lonely Woman\\". In both concept and art direction, Coup de Grace references Peter Br√∂tzmann's 1968 album Machine Gun, which also features Bennink. Quiet As It's Kept Quiet As It's Kept, is the first studio recording of the Armen Nalbandian Trio with Eric Revis on bass and Nasheet Waits on drums. Nalbandian is featured on the Fender Rhodes. The trio recording contains first takes of solely original compositions by Nalbandian.

Quiet As It's Kept has been featured Los Angeles-based radio station KCRW. Surrounded by Snakes On March 15, 2013, he released his 8th album, Surrounded by Snakes, a 13-song album consisting of original compositions that feature him in an experimental electronic setting with improvised solos. Nalbandian is the sole producer and instrumentalist on the album. The album artwork was designed by Joshua Asante of the Arkansas blues bands Velvet Kente and Amasa Hines. The album artwork was designed by Joshua Asante of the Arkansas blues bands Velvet Kente and Amasa Hines. Time Waits Inspired by the intimacy and sparseness of Keith Jarrett's album The Melody at Night, with You, Nalbandian released his first solo piano album, Time Waits, on May 23, 2014. It consists of eight compositions, including a reworking of \\"Conflicted\\" from his album Manchester Born. The additional material includes \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\" by Hoagy Carmichael and popularized by Frank Sinatra, \\"Ugly Beauty\\" by Thelonious Monk, and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" by Radiohead. Time Waits and Alis Grave Nil consist of performances recorded at Nino Moschella's Bird & Egg studio. Alis Grave Nil Nalbandian's tenth album, Alis Grave Nil, is a follow-up to Time Waits. Originating from the same solo piano recording session as Time Waits; it was released on July 23, 2014. Alis Grave Nil (translated from Latin meaning \\"nothing is heavy to those who have wings\\") includes compositions by Nalbandian, Charlie Chaplin, Eubie Blake, & the first part of fellow LA-native Kendrick Lamar's song Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst from his album Good Kid M.A.A.D. City. The album artwork of both \\"Time Waits\\" and \\"Alis Grave Nil\\" feature paintings by Armen Nalbandian created only months prior to the recordings. Nalbandian has referred to both solo albums as \\"a requiem of my early career.\\" Nalbandian contends \\"there is a great deal of symbolism throughout the first 10 albums and they are connected in many ways, AGN concludes the story.\\" 2018 Albums In 2018, Nalbandian released 8 albums chronicling his studio and live performances from 2017. The recordings cover his solo piano work, trio and V. The albums were released one at a time, each month for the first 8 months of 2018, culminating with a live trio performance in September 2018 in memory of Cecil Taylor; who had passed away earlier in the year. Activism  Nalbandian has most often used his platform to recognize social and civil injustice and perform many humanitarian services. He has raised thousands of dollars in aid for the victims of Hurricane Katrina by way of many benefit concerts. Nalbandian has also raised money for organizations as diverse as The United Way, The Red Cross, the ONE Campaign, Habitat for Humanity, The American Cancer Society, Breast Cancer Research and The Relay for Life Foundation, among others. In September 2009, Nalbandian appeared in the play Semblance: Notes from the Promised Land by Devoya Mayo. The final act of the play featured a soliloquy written and performed by Nalbandian, critical of the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Nalbandian has made critical comments from the bandstand regarding America's proposed cuts to funding for the arts and its withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, never addressing the administration by name. Visual and fine art collaborations  From 2004 to 2008, Nalbandian served as the Artist-in-Residence/Music Director of the Fresno Art Museum, Artistic Director of Jazz @ the F.A.M., Artistic Director of the F.O.R.M. (Festival of Resurrected Music), and curator of the Rhythms of Art in which he composed concerts of original music inspired by the exhibitions at the Fresno Art Museum on a monthly basis. The programming also included educational components for children and adults, concerts which highlighted the music of jazz masters and supplemental concerts that focused on collaboration. While Nalbandian's first season musically focused on a primarily traditional foundation, primarily inspired by Duke Ellington, his approach and compositions for the following 3 seasons were highly inspired by the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), Wadada Leo Smith, Bill Dixon, Anthony Braxton, Henry Threadgill & The Art Ensemble of Chicago. Nalbandian concluded his artistic residency at the Fresno Art Museum by performing a solo piano program of composer John Zorn's Masada music encouraged with the composer's blessing. Nalbandian has often referenced the art of Jean-Michel Basquiat in his early work and song titles; compositions throughout his early discography reference specific Basquiat paintings and graffiti. Nalbandian presented a concert inspired by Basquiat's work in March 2008 during his tenure as Artist-in-Residence at the Fresno Art Museum. Nalbandian has also composed and premiered music inspired by the work of Kerry James Marshall, Theaster Gates, Kara Walker, David Hammons, Arshille Gorky, Anne Scheid, and Garo Antreasian, who wrote of Nalbandian's work in his 2016 biography, Reflections on Life and Art.name=\\"https://muse.jhu.edu/book/43315 In March 2017, Nalbandian premiered a new composition, Heirloom, with his trio with Revis and Waits inspired by \\"Heirlooms and Accessories\\" by Kerry James Marshall after several viewings at both Marshall's retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and The Underground Museum.

(born 24 January 1956) is a former Governor of the Indonesian Central Bank. He held the office for a five- year term from 24 May 2013 to 24 May 2018. Previously, he was Finance Minister of Indonesia between 2010 and 2013 after succeeding former minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who resigned from the office and took position as Managing Director of the World Bank Group.  Early career  Agus was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands. After graduating from University of Indonesia's School of Economics in 1984, he became an international loan officer at the Indonesian branch of Bank of America. Agus has a long career as one of top bankers in Indonesia. He was the Chief Executive Officer of Bank Mandiri, the largest bank in Indonesia, between 2005 and 2010. He was the President Director of Bank Bumiputera (1995‚Äì1998) and President Director of Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia (1998‚Äì1999). His performance as head of Bank Mandiri was considered successful, as he slashed non-performing loans and raised the bank's profile among international investors. He also increased profits in the banks. In 2008 for example, the bank paid $418m in dividends to the shareholders. He was also instrumental in helping the Finance Ministry in recovering Rp 1.23 trillion (US$133.15 million) of state money from Tommy Soeharto, son of late former president Soeharto.  Finance Ministry  Following the resignation of Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Agus was appointed as Finance Minister in the Second United Indonesia Cabinet. His selection was greeted positively by analysts as he was considered to have managerial skills required for the position. He also has wide international experience and has represented Indonesia in G20 forums. In March 2011 he announced his first fiscal policy as Finance Minister with a focus on promoting real sector growth and investment intended to spur Indonesia‚Äôs economic growth. Highlights of the new regulations included removing the value added tax (VAT) for the sale of houses worth less than Rp 70 million (US$7,910) compared with the previous Rp 55 million; eliminating taxes on the sales of cooking oil and bulk cooking oil for the poor; and providing in advance 50 percent of the funds needed by the State Logistics Agency (Bulog) for the rice for the poor program. Governor of Bank Indonesia In 2008, following resignation of Boediono as Governor of Bank Indonesia to run as Vice President of Indonesia as the running mate of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Agus was nominated as one of candidates for Governor. However his nomination was rejected by the national Legislature, apparently for political reasons. On 22 February 2013, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono surprisingly named Agus as his sole candidate for the governorship, replacing Darmin Nasution. On 27 March 2013, the Indonesian House of Representatives' Finance Commission confirmed Agus as governor of Bank Indonesia for the period of 2013‚Äì2018. Agus won 46 votes of support and seven votes against. One member abstained from the vote.

Usually unlike dead air (broadcasting only silence), a station that is dark or silent does not even transmit a carrier signal. U.S. law=Transmitter operations According to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a radio or television station is considered to have gone dark or silent if it is to be off the air for 30 days or longer. Prior to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a \\"dark\\" station was required to surrender its broadcast license to the FCC, leaving it vulnerable to another party applying for it while its current owner was making efforts to get it back on the air. Following the 1996 landmark legislation, a licensee is no longer required to surrender the license while dark. Instead, the licensee may apply for a \\"Notification of Suspension of Operations/Request for Silent STA\\" (FCC Form 0386), stating the reason why the station has gone silent. A service can go dark for any number of reasons, including financial resources being drained to continue effective operation of the service as being of benefit to its community of license; abandonment for a different channel or to go cable-only; complicated technical adjustments involving radio antenna repair, requiring the broadcast tower to be de-energized for the work to be done; structure fire or natural disaster that has rendered the facility inoperable; or technical adjustments that would make it prohibitively expensive to perform the work and carry on the normal operations of the station in question. The service is not required to notify the FCC of silence if the period of silence is less than 10 days. If the period of silence is to last at least 10 days but less than 30 days, the licensee must notify the FCC in writing explaining why the service is silent and an expected return to the air. A service that expects to be silent for more than 30 days must apply to the FCC using Form 0386, which can be done electronically (preferred method) or by a paper application. On this application, the date the station has gone dark or its targeted date to go silent must be stated on the application, along with the reason for silence. The Silent STA (special temporary authority) is valid for a period of 180 days. If the station is required to remain off the air beyond the 180-day period, a \\"Request to Extend STA\\" must be subsequently filed, along with the reason. However, any broadcast station that is dark (or transmits using facilities different from their license except for operation under STA) for 12 months has their license automatically canceled as a matter of law pursuant to section 312g of the Communications Act as amended. Some stations have been known to re-appear for a week or 2 to keep the license alive (WCKL when owned by the Black United Fund was famous for this as they did it for years) then applying for yet another silent STA. Tower-light markings While a licensed station is silent, it must continue to meet tower lighting and marking requirements as per Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandate. If a station (silent or otherwise) must shut down its lighting system for an extended period of time (such as it being disabled by a lightning strike), it is required to notify the FAA immediately. The station is required to provide the FAA with its assigned tower number, latitude and longitude coordinates, and an anticipated time that the tower light operations will resume. A licensee has 15 days to make the necessary repairs until the FCC is notified by the FAA. Once repairs are made, the FAA must be notified that all is well. Telecommunications Act of 1996 The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was created in part to increase the accountability of broadcasters, while providing requested deregulation in response to the hardships of many small- town broadcasters with small audiences and revenues. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, licensees of stations that were listed as \\"silent\\" by the FCC (at the time around 400) were warned to either power their facilities back up or their licenses would be canceled permanently. The FCC did allow reasonable provision for broadcasters who notified them that they were trying to get back on the air. Nevertheless, many licenses were canceled, primarily those with abandoned facilities.

Habitat and biology The blue lyretail occurs in both savanna and forested regions. The males are larger, more colourful and have larger extendable fins than the females. The males are territorial. The waterbodies in which this species occurs are of an unpredictable nature and it has evolved a spawning strategy which is frequently referred to as a \\"switch\\" or \\"semi-annual\\" breeding strategy. This means that the eggs can survive a period of drying but that they are also viable when permanently submerged. Submerged eggs normally hatch in around 14-21 days depending on the temperature of the water. The eggs are laid on the bottom.

Life Born in Strathroy, Upper Canada, the son of James Keefer and Maria Cook, studied at the Strathroy Grammar School and Upper Canada College before receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1881, a Master of Arts degree in 1882, and a Bachelor of Laws in 1882 all from the University of Toronto. In 1883, he moved to Prince Arthur's Landing (now Thunder Bay) and was called to the Bar in 1884. He practiced law with his brother Thomas Alexander Keefer (c1850-1893). He was created a federal Queen's Counsel in July 1896 and a provincial King's Counsel in January 1908. He first ran unsuccessfully for the Canadian House of Commons as the Conservative candidate for the riding of Thunder Bay and Rainy River in the 1908 federal election. He was elected for Port Arthur and Kenora as the Unionist candidate in the 1917 election and was defeated in 1921. Keefer served as Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for External Affairs from November 1918 to July 1920. Keefer also served municipally, as solicitor and counsel in Port Arthur from 1889 to 1910. At various times he acted as Crown Counsel in the Thunder Bay district. He was a persistent advocate of deep waterways on the Great Lakes, later known as the St Lawrence Seaway and was the Canadian government's watchdog on international water questions such as water levels on the Great Lakes and Lake of the Woods, and the Chicago River water diversion. He also did legal work for the International Joint Commission. Keefer married Annie Frances Daby in 1884. After her death in 1915, Keefer married Margaret Wilhelmina Keefer (her father's surname was identical). He was elected as the Conservative candidate to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1923 provincial election for the riding of Port Arthur and served until November 1926. He lost the Conservative nomination to the younger and more politically astute Donald McDonald Hogarth. Ontario premier G. Howard Ferguson appointed Keefer Public Trustee of Ontario in April 1928, but Keefer died in Toronto following a heart attack in December that year.

It connects the localities of Tollygunge in the north-west and Rajpur Sonarpur in the south through Garia. The road is narrow, but given its significance it carries a considerable amount of traffic throughout the day. Localities Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road (or N.S.C. Bose Road) starts from the Tollygunge Tram Depot crossing and passes through the localities of Ashoknagar, Ranikuthi, Netaji Nagar, Bansdroni and Naktala and touches Raja SC Mullick Road at Garia and from there passes through Rajpur Sonarpur touching the localities of Garia, Narendrapur, Harinavi up to the southern fringes of South Kolkata. It runs nearly parallel to the Tolly's Nullah all along from Bansdroni. Most of the localities along this road were former refugee colonies, for the huge number of people who had to migrate from erstwhile East Bengal (now Bangladesh) after the partition of Bengal in 1947. To ease the amount of traffic and congestion on this road, the Kolkata Metro's south extension to Garia opened in 2009. The metro tracks run parallel to this road on the Tolly's Nullah and has the following stations: # Netaji (Kudghat) # Masterda Surya Sen (Bansdroni) # Gitanjali (Naktala) # Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazaar) Landmarks Wood Square Mall, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road, Narendrapur There are quite a few important landmarks on this road, such as: # The Indrapuri Film Studios # The ITC Sangeet Research Academy # The Assembly Of God Church School (Tollygunj branch) # Sri Aurobindo Institute of Culture # Swetamber Gujarati Jain Temple at N.S.C.

Aziz was, in fact, the only member of the pre-war Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM) to have served in the 1955 and post-Merdeka Cabinets under Tunku Abdul Rahman. Between 1955 and 1963, he was the Minister for Agriculture and Co-operatives, where his efforts in rural development to improve the lives of padi farmers and fishermen were important although less known compared with similar efforts undertaken by the Rural Development Ministry. Aziz remains an enigma unlike his brother Yusof Ishak who was well known both as a journalist and the founder of Utusan Melayu and as the first President of Singapore after the separation with Malaysia in 1965. Early life Born in 1913 the state of Perak, which was then part of the Federated Malay States, Aziz Ishak is the descendant of prominent Sumatran Malay Datuk Jannatun who migrated to Penang in 1759 or 15 years before Francis Light arrived on the island. Aziz is of Minangkabau descent from his father's side while his mother is a native of Langkat regency in Indonesia.The Istana ‚Äì index His brother is Yusof Ishak was the first President of Singapore and his face adorns the current paper currency of Singapore that is in circulation. Denied entry into the Malay College Kuala Kangsar because of his non-aristocratic background, Aziz attended Victoria Bridge School (now Victoria School) and Raffles Institution in Singapore. His time at Raffles was an important learning experience. He mixed well with students of various ethnic backgrounds and was the School Captain for two years, perhaps the only Malay to have held this distinction. At Raffles, he formed a Malay literary association with friends including Hamid Jumaat, Tun Sardon Jubir and Ahmad Ibrahim and contributed articles on the Malays and their plight to Warta Malaya, a leading Malay newspaper in Singapore. This was done through his brother Yusof who was already working as a journalist. Career=Colonial officer Upon completing his Senior Cambridge, Aziz joined the colonial service in the Fisheries Department-based initially in Port Dickson in 1936, followed by Kuantan and then Batu Kurau where he was responsible for the northern region. In Kuantan, his sympathy for the Malay fishermen did not go down well with officials, notably the English district officer, while in Kuala Kurau his immediate boss wanted him to read books on fisheries only and not literary works. Journalism Frustrated with British officialdom and after being unfairly accused of collaborating with the Japanese by his European boss (who was humiliated by the Japanese during 1942‚Äì45 and imprisoned in Changi), Aziz left the colonial service to join his brother Yusof Ishak after he founded Utusan Melayu. It was through journalism that Aziz became widely known in Malaya. He wrote feature articles on UMNO, on the state and federal administrations and occasionally editorials. Aziz was a member of the KMM while he was a fisheries officer in Kuala Kurau. In 1946, he and Abdul Samad Ismail formed Gerakan Angkatan Melayu Sedar (Geram), which was refused registration by the colonial authority. It was closely watched by the Special Branch. Geram was critical of the Malayan Union; it was also critical of UMNO because of the prominent role of the feudal aristocracy within the movement. Geram died a natural death when Aziz moved to Kuala Lumpur in 1948 as Utusan Melayu correspondent in the central region. Aziz was the only journalist who was appointed a member of the Federal Legislative Council and he played an active role in its proceedings. In September 1951, he urged the government to declare an end to the Emergency. Political involvement Aziz's political involvement was varied. Before 1942, he was a member of the KMM and after 1945 sympathised with the PKMM. However, in 1950 he joined UMNO when it was still led by Datuk Onn Jaafar although his idea of full independence for Malaya at this time was neither acceptable to Onn nor the Tunku Abdul Rahman. When the Independence of Malaya Party was formed in 1951 by Onn, Aziz became deputy chairman of the IMP's Kuala Lumpur branch and contested the 1952 elections in Sentul but lost to the Alliance candidate. In the same year, he left the IMP due to personal differences with Onn. Upon the Tunku's encouragement, he rejoined UMNO in April 1953. Aziz then held important positions within Umno and the Alliance. In 1953, he was appointed to the Alliance Round Table Conference that called for an early general election in Malaya. In 1955, he was appointed head of Selangor UMNO and chairman of the Selangor Alliance. He was very much involved in drafting the 1955 Alliance manifesto for the general election held that year; the manifesto covered issues such as Malay language, agriculture, economy, education, and finance. In the elections, he stood on the Alliance ticket and won in Kuala Langat. He faced a Parti Negara candidate, a former schoolmate. Despite official backing for Parti Negara, including from the colonial police force, the Alliance went on to win the first national elections, taking 51 of the 52 seats. Earlier in September 1954, Aziz had campaigned actively with the Tunku in the Terengganu election which was won by the Alliance despite open support for Parti Negara by the British. Cabinet position Aziz was appointed Minister of Agriculture and co-operatives, a post he kept until 1963. Tun Abdul Razak took note of Aziz's useful work among the rural folk, especially the setting up of co-operatives to eliminate the exploitation by middlemen. The year 1955 saw a growing rift between Aziz with his Cabinet colleagues, notably the Tunku and Abdul Razak who was overall in charge of rural development. Aziz's blunt criticisms of ministers, such as the wearing of uniforms, did not endear him well with the Tunku. He was also unhappy at the Alliance's neglect of the 1955 manifesto due to the exuberant push for political independence. In his memoirs, Aziz claimed that the 1955 Cabinet was beset with policy differences on various issues, including the replacement of expatriate British officers with Malayans or Malayanisation. Aziz was equally passionate on press freedom that he claimed had been eroded after 1955. Aziz resigned from the Cabinet in 1963 after he was transferred to the Health Ministry. This was due to irreconcilable differences with the Tunku and other Cabinet colleagues on strategies for rural development.Weiss, Meredith Leigh: \\"Protest and Possibilities: Civil Society and Coalitions for Political Change in Malaysia\\", Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 2005, There was no place for a socialist in a Cabinet that was pursuing capitalistic policies and firmly committed to upholding a free-market economy. Soon after, he was expelled from UMNO. Aziz eventually went on to form the short lived National Convention Party that joined the left wing Malayan Peoples' Socialist Front together with the Labour Party of Malaya and Partai Ra'ayat to contest the 1964 general elections. Post-Cabinet In 1963, soon after the outbreak of the Konfrontasi between Malaysia and Indonesia, the Alliance government began yet another massive round up of politicians and activists among the opposition under the Internal Security Act. Among those arrested and detained were Ahmad Boestaman, Ishak Haji Muhammad, Abdul Aziz Ishak (head of GERAM), Datuk Kampo Radjo (later the president of PRM), Tan Kai Hee, Tan Hock Hin, Dr. Rajakumar, Hasnul Hadi, Tajuddin Kahar and hundreds of others. Aziz was accused of being a traitor and collaborating with Indonesian agents to form a government-in-exile, a charge that he denied. He was detained between 1965 and 1966 under the law. In his book Special Guest: The Detention in Malaysia of an Ex-Cabinet Minister he describes in detail the irreconcilable differences with the Tunku and the events that led to his resignation, subsequent detention and release. The book was banned and only allowed restricted access in university libraries. His earlier biographical account Katak Keluar dari Bawah Tempurong stopped at 1955 and his subsequent appointment as minister. As a result, not much is known about Aziz Ishak and his role in the struggle for independence through the newspaper Utusan Melayu and in the political arena when he was head of Selangor UMNO and Selangor Alliance in the mid-1950s when the political bargaining among the Alliance partners were struck. He turned down all subsequent offers of state and federal awards. References * The 'unknown' Aziz Ishak, The Star, 6 August 2007. * Aziz kept bucking his British bosses, The Star, 6 August 2007.

Background This area had been part of the Oneida people's homeland since their emergence as a culture in the fourteenth century. After the American Revolutionary War, the United States government allocated a reservation in this area for the Oneida Nation, who had been allies of the Patriots. But land pressure continued as European-American settlers poured into central and western New York seeking land to purchase and develop for farming. The state wanted more land available for sale. On September 22, 1788 at Fort Schuyler, a treaty between Governor George Clinton and the Oneida Indians ceded this land from the tribe to the state of New York. The \\"Twenty Townships\\" west of the Unadilla River, conveyed by the Oneida Indians in 1788. Known as \\"Clinton's Purchase\\" The southern part of the Twenty Townships became a part of Chenango and the northern part was included in Madison County when it was created from Chenango County in 1806. The northern townships that became a part of Madison County, New York were: *1. Nelson *2. Eaton *3. Madison *4. Hamilton *5. Lebanon *6. Georgetown *18. south part of Brookfield *19. north part of Brookfield In 1829, the southern townships that became a part of Chenango County, New York were: *7.Otselic *8. Smyrna *9. Sherburne *10. north part of Norwich *11. Plymouth *12. Pharsalia *13. McDonough *14. Preston *15. south part of Norwich *16. New Berlin (also includes parts of 10 and 15) *17. Columbus Township 20 became the Town of Sangerfield and the western part of Bridgewater in Oneida County. In the late twentieth century, the Oneida Nation pursued a land claim against New York State to recover its lands or compensation. The United States Supreme Court ruled that, as this treaty and sale were never ratified by the United States Senate, it was unconstitutional. After the Revolution and the formation of the United States under a written constitution, New York State had no legal authority to negotiate separately with American Indian tribes.

Below is a list of Shetland's domesticated animals.  Shetland Pony  The Shetland Pony is a very small, robust breed of pony. Shetlands range in size from about 710 to 1070 mm, an official maximum height at the withers (1200 mm for American Shetlands). Shetland Ponies have heavy coats and short legs, and are considered quite intelligent. They are a very strong breed, used for riding, driving, and pack purposes.\\"Breed History\\" Shetland Pony Studbook Society. Cit. 20.7.2009.\\"Shetland Pony\\" Equine World. Cit. 20.7.2009.  Shetland Sheepdog  The original Shetland Sheepdog was of Spitz type, similar to the Icelandic Sheepdog and other Scandinavian dogs. However, in the course of development in England as a pet breed, it was crossbred with other dogs including the Rough Collie and the Pomeranian; and the modern Shetland or \\"Sheltie\\" now resembles a miniature Rough Collie. The original working Shetland Sheepdog does not survive. Modern Shetland Sheepdogs are used primarily as pets, but excel at canine sports such as agility and obedience. Most retain some herding instinct, to varying degrees.  Shetland cattle  The cattle kept in Shetland developed as a very hardy, small breed, used for both dairy and beef. Modern Shetland cattle are usually pied black and white, although other colours were common in the past and sometimes still occur. These cattle are similar in type to other European traditional cattle breeds, and are sometimes used for conservation grazing (the management of natural habitats using grazing animals).\\"Home\\" Shetland Cattle Breeders Association. Cit. 20.7.2009.  Shetland sheep  Shetland ewes Sheep have been kept in the Shetland Isles for at least a thousand years. They are one of the Northern European short-tailed sheep group of breeds, and were regarded as a local version of the extinct Scottish Dunface, which was found throughout the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (and which was also the ancestor of the Hebridean and North Ronaldsay sheep). Shetlands are classed as a landrace or \\"unimproved\\" breed. Although Shetlands are small and slow-growing compared to other breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, adaptable and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet\\"Sheep Breeds - S-St\\". Sheep101.info. Cit. 1.5.2009. so they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts so they are easier to care for than many modern breeds.  Shetland pig  Shetland was the last surviving locality for a type of domestic pig known as the \\"grice\\". Small in size yet ferocious, this domesticated breed of pig fell out of favour with crofters during the 19th century; sometime between the middle of the 19th centuryShetland pig is not so appealing as the pony and the 1920s, the breed became extinct. Note that Fetlar is one of the North Isles of Shetland. In addition to the Shetland Islands, the grice had once been found throughout the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, as well as in Ireland. Shetland goose The Shetland goose is a small, hardy breed of domestic goose originating in the islands. It is sexually dimorphic, with ganders being entirely white and females white with grey patches. They tend to mate for life and are extremely good foragers. A small number have been exported to North America, but are not yet recognised by the American Poultry Association. Shetland duck The Shetland duck is a small, hardy breed of domestic duck originating in the islands. It is similar to the Pomeranian duck or Swedish Blue duck. It is black with a white bib. Shetland drakes have sky blue bills and Shetland duck females have slate blue bills. The average weight of the Shetland duck is 2 kg for males and 1,8 kg for females. It is critically endangered.

Surrounding villages and towns include Little Yeldham, Tilbury Juxta Clare, Toppesfield, Stambourne, Ridgewell, Sible Hedingham, Castle Hedingham, Halstead and Sudbury (Suffolk). Great Yeldham is situated along the busy main A1017 road (formerly A604) between Braintree and Haverhill. Until 1962 it was served for passenger traffic by Yeldham railway station on the Colne Valley and Halstead Railway line between Chappel and Wakes Colne and Haverhill. The line crossed what was called Station Road at a level crossing. The road has since been renamed 'Toppesfield Road'. The village is where the infant River Colne is joined by a stream from near Stambourne and another that has flowed via Toppesfield. The river flows via Colchester on its 39-mile journey to the sea. Great Yeldham contains the \\"Great Oak\\", an old preserved oak tree in the centre of the village, which is claimed to have been recorded in William the Conqueror's Domesday Book of 1086. From the 1950s to the 1970s Great Yelham was home to the Whitlock Bros, manufacturers and exporters of Dinkum Diggers (tractors with backhoes and fronthoes, often known these days as 'JCB's). In 1972 Whitlock Bros. was taken over by Hymac, and production subsequently moved to Rymmny in Wales. The Great Yeldham plant closed, resulting in many job losses for the region. In 1967 Great Yeldham elected a Communist councillor, June Cohen, to the surprise of many in the area. The land around Great Yeldham is principally used for arable farming and some livestock rearing. From the early 1950s until the mid-1980s Great Yeldham was also known for its apple and strawberry farm called Lark Hill Farm, to which people came from miles around to pick their own fruit.

The north-south six-lane National Highway 44 (NH-44) as well as the East-West Highway 69 go through the district. A rail line runs north from Bangalore to the town of Chikballapur, east past Doddaganjur to Srinivaspur and south to the town of Kolar. Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple (also spelt \\"Bhoga Nandishwara\\" or \\"Bhoga Nandishvara\\") is a Hindu temple located in Nandi village, at the base of Nandi Hills (or Nandidurga) in the Chikkaballapur district of Karnataka state, India. It is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. History Yali pillars at Ranganatha temple, Rangasthala According to a popular legend, the Marigowda, the son of the chief Avathimalla Biregowda, was hunting one day in the Kodimanchanahalli forest. He found a rabbit standing fearlessly in front of hunting dogs. Excited by this, the chief told his son that it was a sign of the boldness of the local people. So, he obtained permission from the king of Vijayanagara and built a fort and a town. This in course of time developed into the town of Chickballapur. During the rule of Baichegowda, the king of Mysore attacked the fort but had to withdraw due to the interference of Marathas. Dodda Byregowda, who came to power after Baichegowda, resumed control of the territories seized earlier by Mysore. In 1762, during the rule of Chikkappanayaka, Hyder Ali laid siege the town for a period of three months. Then Chikkappanayaka agreed to pay 5-lakhs pagodas, and the army was withdrawn. After this, Chikkappa Nayaka with the help of Murariraya of Gooty tried to get back his powers. He was hiding at Nandi hills along with Chikkappa Nayaka. Immediately Hyder Ali took Chickballapur and other places and arrested Chikkappa Nayaka. Then with interfere of Lord Cornwallis, Chickballapur was handed over to Narayanagowda.some sources suggest that Lord Cornvallis visited the temple of Lord Shiva in Peresandra which is 18 km off of chikkaballapur.in few references British text suggest that Peresandra has a tremendous history; upon knowing this, Tipu Sultan again acquired Chikballapur.

Introduced as a grandmother character running an orphanage, it was revealed through backstory that she had formerly been the mistress of Edward Quartermaine, with whom she had the son Bradley Ward. She is also the grandmother of the late Justus Ward (M'fundo Morrison), Keesha Ward and the great-grandmother of Maya Ward. Casting The role of Mary Mae Ward was originated by Rosalind Cash (1938-1995) in 1994, who played her as a proud matriarch character who had triumphed over racism and tragedy. When Cash died of cancer in 1995, the Mary Mae Ward character was written out of the series, with an explanation of having died of natural causes. In 1996, Cash was posthumously nominated for an Emmy Award, for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Brief Character History Mary Mae Ward showed up in Port Charles after Laura Spencer bought the Ward House. Mary Mae and Laura became instant friends and ran an orphanage out of the Ward House. After her son Bradley Ward was found dead in Luke and Laura Spencer's yard, Mary Mae's grandson Justus and granddaughter Keesha came to Port Charles to attend Bradley's funeral. Bradley had been murdered, but who killed him? Keesha began dating the young, rich Jason Quartermaine. Mary Mae and Edward Quartermaine, both grandparents of the teens, weren't happy about the two dating each other. Soon all evidence of Bradley's death was pointing to Edward as the murderer. Edward was arrested and charged. He swore on his life to Mary Mae that he was not her son's killer. Mary Mae knew it and revealed during her testimony that Bradley was Edward's son. Edward had wartime romance with Mary Mae when she was a blue singer years ago which resulted in the conception of Bradley. Edward was later acquitted. Mary Mae found herself singing the blues again when Lois Cerullo offered her a job at her record label, L&B.; Mary Mae was a hit at Luke's club where everyone would go to listen to her beautiful voice. Mary Mae was adored by many in Port Charles. When she died in her sleep in January 1996, the whole town turned out to pay their respects to their beloved Mary Mae.

Hills and landscape This region has several tall granitic hills which are famous for many short rock climbs, typically 1 to 2 pitches in length. Grades vary from 5.8 American to 5.11 American. It is home to some of the world's oldest granite outcrops. Some of the interesting climbs are on the Wanakkal wall (\\"Gabbar ki asli pasand\\", \\"Labor pain\\"), on the Rainbow wall (\\"UIAA\\", \\"Kalia\\"), on Anna-Thamma (\\"Darkness at dawn\\", \\"Black Diamond\\", the name Anna- Thama means 'elder-brother-younger-brother' in Kannada). Ramdevarabetta showing the cave entrances made for the film A Passage to India Another well- known hill is Ramadevarabetta. Along with Savandurga this was one of the shooting locations for David Lean's A Passage to India.

This belt of rocks extends in the north-south direction in 50 km belt. This belt has younger potassic granites and is believed to separate two distinct crustal blocks of Archaean age. The block to the west has low-grade granite-greenstone belts with iron- manganese ores and to the east are younger gneiss of granitic and granodioritic composition with gold-bearing schist belts.Atomic minerals directorate ReferencesExternal links * Official website View from Ramadevarabetta Category:Climbing areas Category:Districts of Karnataka Category:2007 establishments in India ","title":"Ramanagara district"},{"id":"12690257","text":"In human‚Äìcomputer interaction and UI design, a first-time user experience (FTUE) refers to the initial stages of using a piece of software. It commonly includes configuration steps, such as signing up for an account. Every user of a service has his/her own FTUE, even if he/she has extensive experience with using a similar product. Patience, time investment, and intuitiveness are factors for a user's FTUE. Software services generally have different layouts, styles, graphics, and hotkeys which must be identified to contribute to a user's learning, mastery, and efficiency of the software. The FTUE is responsible for setting the stage for the experience of the user when interacting with a product down the line. This differs from the out-of-box experience (OOBE), which is specifically about packaging, information presentation, and setup of the system out of the box. FTUE interface of the Wikipedia Android app. The screen will not appear on subsequent uses of the app unless the app data is cleared.  Relation to the cold start problem  FTUEs are directly related to the well-known cold start problem in recommender systems, which attempts to balance the ease of the initial experience with the difficulty of gathering the needed information to make quality recommendations to the user. Generally, an effort is made to increase user retention by minimizing the barriers to entry while maximizing the quality of the recommendations for the user. For example, it was found that by changing the FTUE task from rating 15 individual items to rating a smaller number of groups of items, the time taken to complete the initial task was reduced by more than 50% and user satisfaction with the resulting recommendations increased. However, there is evidence that steeper entry requirements can lead to more dedicated users. Furthermore, in a study at the University of Minnesota, it was found that increasing the barriers to entry can increase the amount of user-generated content produced during the FTUE without sacrificing the quality of the content. Users subjected to a more difficult FTUE may also be more likely to produce more content in the future. This comes at a tradeoff, as the user attrition rate gradually increases with a higher barrier to entry. In this light, the idea of the FTUE becomes one of maximizing the benefit to the online community and the quality of the recommendations while minimizing the increase in the rate of user attrition.  User retention  Preventing customers from abandoning software after the initial exposure is a goal of good FTUE design. The following are examples of efforts in user retention. *Speed vs Quality: First impressions on the initial user interface (UI) of an interactive application depend on multiple factors; most notably speed and quality. Speed and quality are not necessarily inversely related, but if there is a limit on the amount of development hours available for a project, one of the two will generally suffer. Depending on the application, a sacrifice in either speed or quality must usually be made. Sacrifices in quality can include fewer luxury features, less intuitive/advanced UI features, or minimal customization. Sacrifices in speed can result in overall sluggish performance or delayed responsiveness when interacting with external clients or servers. Both are important to the \\"feel\\" of the application, and thus factor into the FTUE. *Negative first time user experiences: Negative FTUEs can severely impact user retention. Negative experiences can be related to over-complicated initial registration procedures. Requiring multiple stages of registration and email/phone verification can result in users abandoning the registration completely. *Social login: This allows users to create an account based on pre-obtained information from social networking profiles such as Facebook. Popular applications such as Spotify, Quora, Pinterest and more offer this method of registration. Up to 92% of people have reported leaving websites permanently instead of recovering lost login information; social login can help combat this by converting monthly unique users to monthly active users. Social login also allows access to the user's friends or contacts. This offers up more opportunity personalization and potential virality considering up to 78% of people claim to have visited a website after seeing it mentioned on their social network, and that they heavily weigh their friends recommendations for purchases of products mentioned via social media. *Structured setup: A set of clearly outlined steps to completion/registration is key for a successful FTUE. For example, Facebook registration clearly displays the number of steps remaining before the creation of a new profile is complete. This type of transparency is favorable because ‚Äúuncertain, unexplained waits feel longer than known, finite waits.‚Äù The more structured and clear the remaining time and number of steps remaining are, the more likely a user will be patient enough to go through and complete all of the steps required to get through the FTUE. *Paid upgrades: Offering an opportunity to purchase an upgrade in the FTUE process can be advantageous considering that new users tend to be more motivated or enthusiastic. They will thereby be more likely to become paying customers instead of freemium users. After spending the time to install software and register, a user has shown at least moderate dedication to the technology and may be invested enough to pay for an upgrade they had not originally considered. Dropbox does this by offering more storage for a dollar amount per month with a simple, non-invasive question. Vimeo offers a professional package, as is common with many online services. Prolonged user experience An illustration describing the temporality of experience for extended interaction with products. While desired early experiences commonly seem to relate to pleasant sensational aspects of software and product use, prolonged experiences are significantly more tied to aspects that reflect how the product may become meaningful in the user's life. Social products are not solely responsible for mediating goal achievement; they fulfill an inner need for personal growth and communicating messages about the user's self-identity in a social setting. As a user's familiarity with a product strengthens over time, it is expected that they would experience less frustration, as well as less excitement. As a result, the perceived quality of the product is expected to change, and therefore the relative importance of different qualities in the product can also change over time. It is widely accepted that learnability and novelty are critical during initial phases of product use, however, other aspects such as a product's social capital are likely to motivate prolonged use. The experience of a service or product's use is consistent of three main forces: familiarity, functional dependency, and emotional attachment. These three forces are responsible for shifting a users' experience across three phases: orientation, incorporation, and identification, respectively. The incorporation factor is the most significant user experience phase of the three. Incorporation makes long-term usability become much more important than the initial learnability, and the product's usefulness becomes the main factor impacting the product's overall value in the eye of the user. As the user accepts the product into their lives, it participates in normal social interactions, and integrates with part of the users self-identity that connects to others and creates a sense of community, building identification. The actual experience with the product has been found to be more influential to users' satisfaction than their prior expectations, though the act of anticipation and creation of expectations is a crucial part of the primary user experience. Sometimes anticipating experiences with a product becomes even more important, emotional, and memorable than the experiences itself. Effective and successful services and products are designed for daily rituals and designed for the self. Users become attached to products that support a self-identity that they wish to communicate in certain settings. Products and self-identity have been a major part of consumer behavior research, but still remain largely unexplored in CHI and design research.

In 1982, he was made a Lord Justice of Appeal and made a Privy Counsellor, serving until 1989.  Maguire Seven inquiry  On 20 October 1989 following the quashing of the Guildford Four convictions, May was appointed to chair an inquiry into both that case and the related case of the Maguire Seven. On 12 July 1990, the Home Secretary David Waddington published the interim report, Interim Report on the Maguire Case: The Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the convictions arising out of the bomb attacks in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974.Hansard Debates 12 July 1990 The report criticised the trial judge Lord Donaldson of Lymington.

Its community of license had been Windber, Pennsylvania. This station's last owner had been Jotocon Communications, which took over operations in 1989, but the station would go silent in 1991 and its license was cancelled in 1996. History Originally known as WWBR, the station signed on May 18, 1964 from studios and offices at 1311 Midway Avenue in its then-city of license of Windber, and under the ownership of Windber Community Broadcasting System. Dr. E.Z. Epperjessy served as company president, and George Ledney served as the station's first general manager. First sale In January 1975, the station was sold by Windber Community Broadcasting System to WWBR, Inc. Louis Popp served as company president and general manager. Station operations were moved to 1724 Scalp Avenue, in Richland Township, overlooking the city of Johnstown, in 1979. The following year, the station increased its power from 1,000 to 2,500 watts non-directional, but still retained its daytime-only status. Second and third sales One of this station's owners was legendary Pittsburgh radio and television newscaster Hank Baughman, who left his job as anchorman of WPXI-TV's 11 o'clock news in June 1985, to purchase his own station. Doing business as Baughman Media, Inc., the station was airing mostly MOR music from 10-inch tape reels from Drake- Chenault's music library. Not long after his arrival, Baughman changed the call letters to WBEM and affiliated the station with the ABC Talkradio network, airing a mixture of both local and national talk. Unforeseen circumstances shortened Baughman's tenure of ownership, resulting in the station's sale to Greater Johnstown Radio, Inc. in August 1986. Baughman returned to Pittsburgh, where he took a job with WSHH, and remains there today. Greater Johnstown Radio, Inc. was headed by David Rod Wolf, who owned Altoona-based WRTA. Because Johnstown and Altoona were separate radio markets despite both cities being in a combined television market, the transaction still met FCC ownership limits. Final sale and demise WBEM was unable to prosper, and on April 1, 1989, the station was sold again, this time to Jotocon Communications. WBEM had fallen on hard times over the years, largely due to the collapse of Johnstown's lucrative local coal and steel-based economy, which had a domino effect on retail business in the area. Because the landscape was already dominated with high and medium-powered FM stations now too in a period of hardship, WBEM found itself in a weak position to compete as a strict daytime-only station. WBEM finally fell silent in 1991, around the time its license was set to expire, which was August 1. Its studio building was then cleared out of all of its equipment, with all traces of a radio station's existence removed, including its broadcast tower. The station did not formally forfeit its license, and it was ultimately cancelled under terms outlined in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Aftermath In January 2004, the FCC received an application for a new station to broadcast at 1350 kHz from Southwest Pennsylvania Community Radio, LLC; owned by Michael Horvath, of North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Horvath had owned two previous radio stations in the Pittsburgh radio market, known then as WXVX (now WPGR) Monroeville and WPLW (later WZUM) Carnegie, which he had acquired in the mid-1990s before selling both in the early years of the 21st century. Prior to selling both, Horvath had invested substantially in new directional antenna arrays, making them more palatable to prospective buyers. Unlike its predecessor, the succeeding station would have been licensed to Geistown, Pennsylvania, located just east of the Johnstown city limits. Another application was received in July 2007 to modify the application, which also included antenna diagrams for building the new six-tower directional antenna system and its proposed operational pattern. On September 2, 2010, the construction permit to build the new station on this frequency was formally cancelled.

Biography Pomerene was born June 22, 1920 in Yonkers, New York. His father was Joel Pomerene and mother was Elsie Bower. He received the BS degree in electrical engineering from Northwestern University in 1942. In 1945 he married Edythe Schwenn and had three children. In 1946, he joined the Electronic Computer Project at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey under the leadership of John von Neumann. The project built a parallel stored program computer called the IAS machine that was the prototype for a number of machines such as the MANIAC I, ORACLE, and ILLIAC series. Pomerene designed and implemented the adder portion of the arithmetic unit.Gilchrist, Bruce, \\"Remembering Some Early Computers, 1948-1960\\", Columbia University EPIC, 2006, pp.7-9. Collaborating with engineers such as Bruce Gilchrist and Y.K. Wong, they invented a fast adder which incorporated a speed up technique for asynchronous adders reducing the time for additive carry-overs to propagate. This design was actually later incorporated in one commercial computer, the Philco TRANSAC S-2000, introduced in 1957, the first commercial transistorized computer. Pomerene became chief engineer on the IAS computer project from 1951 to 1956. In Summer 1956, Pomerene joined the IBM Corporation in Poughkeepsie, where he and several others started the development of various electronic computer systems such as the IBM 7030 and Harvest computers. He was appointed an IBM Fellow in 1976. He held 37 patents when he retired from IBM in 1993. Pomerene was a Life Fellow of the IEEE and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He received the IEEE Edison Medal in 1993, and the Eckert-Mauchly Award in 2006. He died December 7, 2008 in Chappaqua, New York.

He spent 63 years in different regions of the province, working among the Shuswap, Kootenai, Dakelh, Sekani, Gitxsan, Hagwilget, Babine and Lheidli T'enneh First Nations. British Columbia Nicholas Coccola left France for British Columbia on June 6, 1880 aboard the SS Gascoigne, arriving in New York City thirteen days later. After taking a train to San Francisco, he boarded a small sidewheel sternwheeler and arrived in New Westminster on July 26. At the St. Mary's Mission, Coccola continued his studies and on Passion Sunday, 1881, he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest and sent to Kamloops. Kamloops in the 1880s In 1881, Kamloops was a new settlement and consisted of two stores and a like number of hotels. The First Nations camp was three miles (5 km) outside of the village on the Thompson River. It had thirty homes, a school and a church. When Coccola arrived he began his service with Father Jean-Marie Lejacq, Father Edward Peytavin and Brother Surel, who all stayed in a 24 x 32 log cabin. Coccola spent much of his time building homes and working in the gardens. His duties often extended to providing medical attention to the local residents, as there was no doctor in the region. On one occasion he was sent with medicine for a son of a Chief in the Nicola Valley and when the man recovered, Coccola was sent on more sick calls to Fountain and Lillooet. Donald in the 1880s In August 1883, Coccola and the other missionaries at Kamloops were contacted by Father Albert Lacombe of Alberta with the news that the construction camps of the Canadian Pacific Railway were moving across the Alberta-British Columbia border and that more missionaries were needed to attend to the workers. Nicholas Coccola heeded the call and went to Eagle's Pass and the other advance camps of the railway construction workers. He often stayed in the bunkhouses with the workers, giving communion and instructions and hearing confessions. He went from camp to camp, through to Rogers Pass and in the fall of 1883, arrived in Donald. By then the rails had arrived in town and there was a population of 300 living in tents, boxcars and shacks. Coccola said Mass anywhere he was invited to do so and prepared the children of Donald and nearby Golden for their first Communion. In November 1884, Coccola was at Craigellachie when the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway was driven and with rail construction over, he returned to Kamloops. St. Eugene Mission near Cranbrook, British Columbia St. Eugene Mission In the fall of 1887, Nicolas Coccola had just finished serving in Golden when he was transferred to the St. Eugene Mission near Moyie and north of Cranbrook. The mission was from Golden and river navigation had ended for the year, so Coccola was guided there by a family of Shuswaps. The St. Eugene Mission had a large garden that provided fresh produce for the residents of the mission and the local miners who were prospecting nearby at Wild Horse and Perry Creeks. There were few white settlers in the area and many had left because they had concerns that the local Kootenai First Nations were going to revolt. Their concerns dated back a few years earlier to 1884 when two Kootenai men had been arrested and charged with murdering two white men. Upon learning that there was no evidence to support the charges, Chief Isador led a band of thirty warriors to Wild Horse Creek and broke the two suspects out of the gaol. When confronted, Chief Isador had defended the action with this statement, \\"If it can be found that these men are guilty, I will be the first to punish and deliver them. How many Indians have been found killed and white men not arrested?\\". The Chief then ordered that the judge, the arresting officer and the land surveyor leave the area within twenty-four hours. When Coccola arrived in 1887, the settlers had petitioned the government for protection and North-West Mounted Police (later the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) were established at Galbraith's Ferry, later known as Fort Steele, which was seven miles (11 km) from the St. Eugene Mission. Coccola's work in the St. Eugene Mission were much like what he had performed in Kamloops and along with his regular duties, his medical services were often required. There were few doctors in the region and influenza was a common ailment. In October, 1890 a residential school was opened at the mission with 20 students in attendance. Coccola often visited and held Mass at Ainsworth, Kaslo and Nelson where churches and hospitals were being built to fill the demands of the rush of settlers caused by railway construction. In the fall of 1891, two Kootenai women picking berries along the St. Mary's River discovered a large shiny rock. They carried it for a distance and then discarded it upon reaching a good berry patch. The rock was found by Joseph Bourgeois and its discovery was the beginning of the North Star Mine, which would be purchased for by the CPR's Donald Mann for $40,000 the following year. St. Eugene Mining Company in Moyie in 1908 The story prompted Coccola to suggest to the local Kootenai that mining could be profitable for them as well and advised them to keep a lookout for similar stones. In April 1893, Coccola had just returned to the mission when he was approached by a Kootenai man named Pierre or Pielle, who showed him just such a stone and led him to where he had found it near Moyie Lake. Coccola immediately went to Fort Steele and registered for a miner's licence. He sent the samples to Spokane for analysis. Upon learning that the ore contained high percentages of silver, Coccola, Pielle and a Spokane developer by the name of James Cronin each staked a claim above Moyie Lake and registered them in Fort Steele on June 25. Pielle and Father Coccola both sold their claims in 1895 for $12,000. Father Coccola became known as the \\"miner priest\\" and he used the profits to construct a hospital and a new gothic church in the St. Eugene Mission as well as another church in Moyie. Throughout the next decade the St. Eugene Mine produced more than $10,000,000 in ore and was the catalyst for the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, later known as Cominco. Fort George Fort George and surveyor Frank Swannell in 1909 By 1911, Nicolas Coccola was visiting the First Nations Lheidli T'enneh village at Fort George, later Prince George, regularly and he began to grow concerned over the bad influences of the railway construction workers and settlers in the nearby townsite of South Fort George, where there was a large licensed hotel. The First Nations village was a valuable property, as it had been decided that the railway was going to pass through Fort George. Several different concerns tried to purchase the property, among them Charles Vance Millar of the BC Express Company. Eventually the railway succeeded in negotiating for the property and with Nicolas Coccola as the band's spokesman, the village was sold for $125,000 and a new reservation was built north on the Fraser River. By the summer of 1913, the old First Nations village was burned and only the church was left standing. Church at Fort George Reservation No.2 in 1914 On August 31, 1913, Coccola blessed the new reservation and its church. Several townspeople from Fort George arrived in boats to watch the ceremony. He then returned to Fort St. James and Stoney Creek for the winter. In the spring of 1914, he traveled to Smithers where three lots of the new town had been purchased for the construction of a church. He also went to Prince Rupert and inspected the church at Moricetown. In April the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific was completed, but August brought the outbreak of World War I and Coccola returned to Fort St. James. By 1917, Prince George, Fort St. James and Hagwilget each had their own priests and Cocola held Mass and served at other towns along the rails such as Vanderhoof and McBride. In the fall of 1918, the Spanish flu epidemic swept the region. In Stoney Creek, one third of the population was lost and at Fort St. James 14 people died and were buried in a single day. Other victims succumbed out in the wilderness at their trap lines and their bodies were never recovered. Lejac Residential School Lejac Residential School at Fraser Lake 1920's In 1921 construction was begun on a new residential school, this time on Fraser Lake. The Lejac Residential School was completed on January 17, 1922 and the staff and students were moved from the old school at Fort St. James. The same year brought a new St. Joseph's church for Fort Fraser. Coccola was made the principal of the Lejac school that fall and he served there on and off until 1925 when he went to Vancouver for a hernia operation and took some time to visit his old St. Eugene Mission. He returned to the Lejac school and remained there until 1934 when he was made chaplain of Sisters of the Child Jesus Hospital in Smithers. In 1936, pioneer surveyor, Frank Swannell, suggested that Mount Coccola near Hazelton be named in his honor. At Easter in 1940, although retired from missionary work, Coccola was summoned to Moricetown as the residents had found themselves without a priest for the holiday and they didn't want to go without Mass and Communion. After performing his last duties as a missionary, Nicolas Coccola returned to Smithers, where he died on March 1, 1943.

Vacancy  The seat had become vacant when the Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) Noel Skelton had died at the age of 55 on 22 November 1935, 3 days before being returned posthumously at the 1935 general election. A lawyer, journalist and Conservative intellectual, he had held the seat since being elected unopposed at the 1931 general election.  Candidates  The Unionists and their Conservative allies were the dominant group in the National Government, whose parties did not usually stand candidates against each other. A by-election in a Unionist-held seat would therefore normally have been contested by a Unionist candidate, but in this case there was a need to find a seat for Ramsay MacDonald of National Labour, who had been defeated in his Seaham constituency at the 1935 general election. He had led the National Government from 1931 to 1935 and remained Lord President of the Council, so the other government parties agreed that he should contest this by-election, the first since the general election. The Labour Party, which formed the official opposition at Westminster, fielded David Cleghorn Thomson. As a Liberal candidate, Thomson had contested Willesden West in 1923 and Edinburgh South in 1924. After joining Labour, he stood as the Labour candidate in Leith in 1935. The third candidate was Andrew Dewar Gibb, of the Scottish National Party. Gibb, who was Regius Professor of Law at Glasgow University, had also contested the seat in the 1935 general election.  Result  The result was a clear victory for MacDonald, who won over 56% of the votes. However his physical and mental health collapsed later in the year; a sea voyage was recommended to restore his health, and he died at sea in November 1937, triggering another by-election.
