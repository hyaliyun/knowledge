As a player, he was an inside-forward at six professional clubs, most notably Huddersfield Town, Doncaster Rovers and was player manager at Cheltenham Town, where he was sacked as manager for swearing during matches after complaints by two supporters' club members.  Career  After retiring as a player, Cavanagh coached and later managed Brentford. He coached at Nottingham Forest from 1966 until 1972. He then linked up with his former Preston teammate Tommy Docherty as a coach at Manchester United. During this time he worked with George Best, who notably bought him a white television for being late for training Cavanagh stayed at United when Docherty was sacked in 1977 and became assistant manager under Docherty's successor, Dave Sexton, but he left the club following Ron Atkinson's appointment in 1981. From 1976 to 1979 he was also Northern Ireland assistant manager to Danny Blanchflower. He later had a spell as coach at Newcastle United. Ahead of the 1983 season, Cavanagh was hired as manager of Rosenborg. In Norwegian, the terms coach and manager are used interchangeably. Cavanagh had previously done an excellent job as coach at Manchester United, but lacked abilities in team selection, tactics and inspiration.Svardal: 153 He used players in the wrong position, and instructed the ball to be kicked over the midfield, making it impossible to use the playmaker. He believed in breaking down the players and then building them up, and was unarguably good at the former.Svardal: 154 By the summer, his style was costing the club players: Knut Torbjørn Eggen transferred to Orkanger in the Fourth Division, while Øivind Husby transferred to Brøndby in Denmark. Cavanagh was fired in August, at which time the club was second-last in the league, and Nils Arne Eggen took over as manager for the rest of the season.Svardal: 155 The team finished on a seventh place.Svardal: 263 President Erling Meirik withdrew as a consequence of the hiring, stating that in the future, the club should hire people based on more than their reputation and that they should seek judicial assistance with the contract. In 1985, he became Martin Buchan's assistant at Burnley, and took over as manager when Buchan was sacked later that year. After leaving Burnley in 1986, he worked at the FA School of Excellence at Lilleshall until his retirement.  Personal life  In 2002, Cavanagh was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and died in March 2007, aged 78. He was survived by his wife Doris; his five children, Lesley, Thomas, Deborah, Robert and Christine; and his four grandchildren, Alex, Eleanor, Faye and Mariella.

It has been in use for 27,000-40,000 years, during which an estimated of ochre and rock was mined. This has led to suggestions that Wilgie Mia is the world's oldest continuing mining operation.  The Mine  Wilgie Mia is the largest and deepest historic Aboriginal ochre mine in Australia. It is located in a hillside of the Weld Range, near the northwest town of Cue. Worked to a depth of 20 metres, scaffolds had lined the seam face beyond an opening 30 metres across. Archaeological excavations have recovered tools and equipment used in the exploitation of the resource. Wilgie Mia and its surrounding area are of major and ongoing cultural significance and sacredness to the Wajarri Yamatji people and their neighbours. The local creation story tells that the red ochre at Wilgie Mia was formed by the blood of a red kangaroo, Marlu, who died there.  Use of Ochre from Wilgie Mia  Ochre has been an important commodity in the history of Australia, and Wilgie Mia produced large amounts of both red and yellow pigments. A range of colours and high durability are found in the constituent clays of the ochre mined at Wilgie Mia. These are residual to a geological process involving haematite (Fe2O3) and other iron rich compounds. Scientific analysis of ochre reveals the extensive use of Wilgie Mia ochre throughout Western Australia. Wilgie Mia ochre has been used in the production of rock art and other painting practices throughout many regions of Australia.  Recent History  Between the 1940s and the 1970s, Aboriginal miners were temporarily dispersed by miners of European heritage. The mine continues to export ochre as a commercial pigment. Aboriginal miners also continue to extract ochre for use in ceremonies, art and healing practices. Wilgie Mia was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2011. In 2018 the Wajarri Yamatji people obtained exclusive possession native title of the site.

Forces due to gravity, electric fields and magnetic fields are examples of body forces. Body forces contrast with contact forces or surface forces which are exerted to the surface of an object. Normal forces and shear forces between objects are surface forces as they are exerted to the surface of an object. All cohesive surface attraction and contact forces between objects are also considered as surface forces. Fictitious forces such as the centrifugal force, Euler force, and the Coriolis effect are also examples of body forces. Definition=Qualitative A body force is simply a type of force, and so it has the same dimensions as force, [M][L][T]−2. However, it is often convenient to talk about a body force in terms of either the force per unit volume or the force per unit mass. If the force per unit volume is of interest, it is referred to as the force density throughout the system. A body force is distinct from a contact force in that the force does not require contact for transmission. Thus, common forces associated with pressure gradients and conductive and convective heat transmission are not body forces as they require contact between systems to exist. Radiation heat transfer, on the other hand, is a perfect example of a body force. More examples of common body forces include; *Gravity, *Electric forces acting on an object charged throughout its volume, *Magnetic forces acting on currents within an object, such as the braking force that results from eddy currents, Fictitious forces (or inertial forces) can be viewed as body forces. Common inertial forces are, *Centrifugal force, *Coriolis force, *Euler force (or transverse force), which occurs in a rotating reference frame when the rate of rotation of the frame is changing However, fictitious forces are not actually forces. Rather they are corrections to Newton's second law when it is formulated in an accelerating reference frame. Quantitative The body force density is defined so that the volume integral (throughout a volume of interest) of it gives the total force acting throughout the body; :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mathrm{body}} = \\\\int\\\\limits_{V} \\\\rho \\\\mathbf{g}(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\mathrm{d} V \\\\,, where dV is an infinitesimal volume element, ρ is the mass density, and g is the external body force density field acting on the system. Acceleration Like any other force, a body force will cause an object to accelerate. For a non-rigid object, Newton's second law applied to a small volume element is :\\\\mathbf{f} (\\\\mathbf{r})=\\\\rho (\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\mathbf{g} (\\\\mathbf{r}), where ρ(r) is the mass density of the substance, ƒ the force density, and a(r) all at point r. In the case of gravity on a planet surface, g(r) is simply the approximately constant and uniform gravitational field, like on Earth where: :g = 9.81 \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm m}{\\\\mathrm s^2} See also *Fictitious force *Force density *Normal force *Surface force Category:Force ","title":"Body force"},{"id":"10092551","text":"Gouthwaite Reservoir is a reservoir in Nidderdale, North Yorkshire, England.

History  The relocated Gouthwaite Hall The reservoir was constructed between 1893 and 1901. The Elizabethan manor house of Gouthwaite White Hall, the ancient home of the Yorke family, was submerged beneath the reservoir. Gouthwaite Hall was rebuilt beside the reservoir with materials from the old hall, and is now a Grade II listed building. On 1 June 1978, an Royal Air Force Jet Provost aircraft crashed into the reservoir killing the pilot. His body and most of the aircraft were recovered in the following days.  Birdwatching  Gouthwaite Reservoir is a nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The reservoir is independently owned by the Gouthwaite Management Board, but they are advised by Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency, who have created viewing areas for bird watchers on the edge of the reservoir. Tree and shrub cover along the shoreline provides a habitat for small birds such as willow warbler and blackcap. Other records include woodland specialists like great spotted woodpecker and nuthatch. The green woodpecker has also been recorded. In winter, after the summer migrants have gone, the reservoir margins are good for fieldfares and redwings. On the reservoir itself, Canada geese are always present and are joined during the autumn and winter by goosanders and goldeneye accompanied by mallard, tufted duck and pochard. Whooper swans from Iceland frequently join them. Winter is also a good time for birds of prey with buzzard, red kite, hen harriers, merlins and kestrels being observed around the reservoir and the surrounding moorland. Ospreys and golden eagles are frequently observed on passage. It is also the reservoir featured on the opening credits of the UK Soap drama, Emmerdale.

Based on the 1894 Anthony Hope novel The Prisoner of Zenda, it sets the action in contemporary times and transforms the protagonist into British song-and-dance man Richard Rassendyl, who is invited to perform at the wedding of Princess Flavia and King Rudolph of Zenda. Rassendyl unknowingly is related to the King due to his grandmother's romantic escapades years before, and when his royal highness is incapacitated by a general who wishes to seize power, look-alike Rassendyl is recruited to impersonate him. Complications ensue when the imposter finds himself attracted to the bride-to-be and the king's mistress Athena makes her presence known. Hope's original ending was changed to allow the two pairs of star-crossed lovers to live happily ever after. Theatre producer Edwin Lester commissioned the project specifically for Alfred Drake, who had starred in his production of Kismet a decade earlier. Directed by George Schaefer and choreographed by Jack Cole, The scenery was designed by Harry Horner, costumes by Miles White. it began its pre-Broadway tryout on August 5, 1963 at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, then continued to Los Angeles and Pasadena. In addition to Drake in the dual roles of Rassendyl and Rudolph, the cast included Anne Rogers as Flavia and Chita Rivera as Athena. Scenically the production, designed by Harry Horner, was extremely involved with velour covered hard wall sets instead of typical muslin flats. The raised stage platform floor concealed tracks for the various platform wagon sets to be winched on and off stage. The village set, included left and right store facades with false perspective awnings, were stored, hanging in the off stage loft areas, allowing wing storage for the hard wall throne room (painted deep maroon color); a pink boudoir set; a garden set; and a Cathedral Rose stained glass window-wall with a central enlarged double Gothic arched doorway mounted on a six foot deep by thirty foot wide wagon platform. Staging the wedding scene, the couple began their walk at the rear of the stage on the Cathedral steps into the set. As the couple proceeded walking forward down to the foot- light apron, this massive Cathedral wall followed, moving with the couple to the middle of the stage. Interesting is fact the audience never realized that the set was moving downstage with the performers. When the couple turned around, returning upstage, the cathedral wall slowly returned to the back wall position ending the wedding scene. This set wagon wall flew out and was stored against the Curran's stage back wall; a spectacular visual transition, which was never seen by the audience! In Los Angeles, this set piece was replaced with a painted velour framed backing. Harry Horner matched Miles White's costume color, for Princess Flavia's dressing gown robe, spraying the velour boudoir walls the identical costume's pink color. During rehearsals, Miles was jump'n mad with Harry because all you could see was the actress' head bobbing in the identical pink background! The production required a large staff of stage technicians, flymen, and property crew for the major set changes. During the construction of the stage sets, the shop's minimum construction floor space limited and hindered by space for constructing all the wagon sets. The Light Opera rented film stages at the nearby (closed) Allied Artist Studios, located off Sunset Boulevard (KCET TV purchased the property afterwards). Only six blocks travel, carpenters and scenic artists assembled the scenery in two stages at the old film lot. Preparing the dry tint powder base paint for the throne room set, the Scenic charge man did not calculate the correct amount of \\"horse glue\\" binder for the dark maroon paint. Spraying the cream velour covered flats, after drying, the paint did not properly adhere to the velour flats. The result, the paint flaked and stained the stage technicians' hands. Each piece of scenery had to have a muslin case for shipping, keeping the finish from marking and affecting the other pieces of scenery. When this set was handled, each stage technician had to wear gloves when the set was moved into place, or shifted off stage for storage. This set remained a problem throughout the tour. Another folding dimensional scenic arch unit, which had been intended to fold open, and collapse when flown into grid storage position returning into the loft storage areas, became an engineering nightmare. The scenic element, abandoned after two weeks, was replaced by a flat profile garden arch. Harry Horner's scenery and Miles White's costumes provided an intricate, beautiful, handsome detailed production. Film sets and costumes as a stage musical! Reviews in all three cities ranged from mixed to positive, and the box office takes were promising. When Schaefer, who felt the show wasn't ready for Broadway, invited Samuel A. Taylor to revise the book, Freeman objected, claiming the problems lay not with his work but Schaefer's direction. One inherent problem that didn't exist in any of the film adaptations, and which neither writing nor staging could resolve, was Drake's inability to appear as both Rassendyl and Rudolph at the same time. (This did not appear to be a problem in the novel's first dramatisation in 1896; The Prisoner of Zenda opened as a play in the London's West End, co-written by the novel's author and a playwright called Edward Rose.) Schaefer quit the project and Drake quickly followed. The scheduled November 26 opening at the Mark Hellinger Theatre was cancelled, and the project never was revived.

Donative inscriptions engraved on copper plates, often joined together by a ring with the seal of the donor, was the legal document registering the act of endowment. It was probably necessary to produce them when required to prove ownership/ the claim to the rights.Thapar, Romila, The Penguin History of Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300. Penguin Books, 2002. 295-96 and 339. The retrievability of the copper plates was perhaps crucial in the newly settled lands.Thapar, Romila, The Penguin History of Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300. Penguin Books, 2002. 409. Detailed information on land tenures and taxation available from these copper plate grants. History The Sohgaura copper plate inscription, the earliest known of its kind, 3rd century BCE The Taxila copper plate, 1st century BCE (British Museum). Indian copper plate inscriptions (tamarashasana), usually record grants of land or lists of royal lineages carrying the royal seal, a profusion of which have been found in South India. Originally inscriptions were recorded on palm leaves, but when the records were legal documents such as title-deeds they were etched on a cave or temple wall, or more commonly, on copper plates which were then secreted in a safe place such as within the walls or foundation of a temple, or hidden in stone caches in fields. Plates could be used more than once, as when a canceled grant was over-struck with a new inscription. These records were probably in use from the first millennium. Some of the oldest inscribed copper plates to be found in the Indian subcontinent date to the Mature Harappan era, consisting of up to 34 characters and thought to be used for copper plate printing. The so-called Sohgaura copper-plate inscription, inscribed in the Brahmi script, and possibly from the 3rd century BCE Maurya Empire, is a precursor to the later copper-plate inscriptions. However, it is actually written on a small plaque of bronze (a copper alloy). The Taxila and the Kalawan copper-plate inscriptions (c. 1st century CE or earlier) are among the earliest known instances of copper plates being used for writing in the Indian subcontinent. However, these are not proper charters, unlike the later copper-plate inscriptions. The oldest known copper-plate charter from the Indian subcontinent is the Patagandigudem inscription of the 3rd century Ikshvaku king Ehuvala Chamtamula. The oldest known copper-plate charter from northern India is probably the Kalachala grant of Ishvararata, dated to the late fourth century on palaeographic basis. Some of the earliest authenticated copper plates were issued by the Pallava dynasty kings in the 4th century, and are in Prakrit and Sanskrit. An example of early Sanskrit inscription in which Kannada words are used to describe land boundaries, are the Tumbula inscriptions of Western Ganga Dynasty, which have been dated to 444 according to a 2004 Indian newspaper report. Rare copper plates from the Gupta period have been found in North India. The use of copper plate inscriptions increased and for several centuries they remained the primary source of legal records. Most copper plate inscriptions record title-deeds of land-grants made to Brahmanas, individually or collectively. The inscriptions followed a standard formula of identifying the royal donor and his lineage, followed by lengthy honorifics of his history, heroic deeds, and his extraordinary personal traits. After this would follow the details of the grant, including the occasion, the recipient, and the penalties involved if the provisions were disregarded or violated. Although the profusion of complimentary language can be misleading, the discovery of copper plate inscriptions have provided a wealth of material for historians Tirumala Venkateswara Temple have a unique collection of about 3000 copper plates on which the Telugu Sankirtans of Tallapaka Annamacharya and his descendants are inscribed.Epigraphical lore of Tirupati published in Saptagiri magazine. Tamil copper-plate inscriptions Tamil copper-plate inscriptions are engraved copper-plate records of grants of villages, plots of cultivable lands or other privileges to private individuals or public institutions by the members of the various South Indian royal dynasties. The study of these inscriptions has been especially important in reconstructing the history of Tamil Nadu. The grants range in date from the 10th century C.E. to the mid 19th century C.E. A large number of them belong to the Chalukyas, the Cholas and the Vijayanagar kings. These plates are valuable epigraphically as they give us an insight into the social conditions of medieval South India; they also help us fill chronological gaps in the connected history of the ruling dynasties. For example, the Leyden grant (so called as they are preserved in the Museum of Leyden in Holland) of Parantaka Chola and those of Parakesari Uttama Chola are among the most important, although the most useful part, i.e., the genealogical section, of the latter's plates seems to have been lost. File:Dharmeshwara Temple Plates.jpgPlate 1 and Back File:Dharmeshwara Temple Plates HT-34.jpgPlate 2 Unlike the neighbouring states where early inscriptions were written in Sanskrit and Prakrit, the early inscriptions in Tamil Nadu used Tamil along with some Prakrit. Tamil has the extant literature amongst the Dravidian languages, but dating the language and the literature precisely is difficult. Literary works in India were preserved either in palm leaf manuscripts (implying repeated copying and recopying) or through oral transmission, making direct dating impossible.Dating of Indian literature is largely based on relative dating relying on internal evidences with a few anchors. I. Mahadevan’s dating of Pukalur inscription proves some of the Sangam verses. See George L. Hart, \\"Poems of Ancient Tamil, University of Berkeley Press, 1975, p.7-8 External chronological records and internal linguistic evidence, however, indicate that extant works were probably compiled sometime between the 4th century BCE and the 3rd century CE.George Hart, \\"Some Related Literary Conventions in Tamil and Indo-Aryan and Their Significance\\" Journal of the American Oriental Society, 94:2 (Apr-Jun 1974), pp. 157-167.Kamil Veith Zvelebil, Companion Studies to the History of Tamil Literature, pp12Nilakanta Sastri, K.A.

Grants Paramara ruler Siyaka's Harsola copperplate copper plate of 949 CE One of the most important sources of history in the Indian subcontinent are the royal records of grants engraved on copper-plates (tamra-shasan or tamra-patra; tamra means copper in Sanskrit and several other Indian languages). Because copper does not rust or decay, they can survive virtually indefinitely. Collections of archaeological texts from the copper- plates and rock-inscriptions have been compiled and published by the Archaeological Survey of India during the past century.

Vacationland was built in 1952 by Great Lakes Engineering Works in River Rouge, Michigan for the State of Michigan's Department of Highways at a cost of $4,745,000. She was designed by Prof. L. A. Baier of the University of Michigan's Marine Engineering Department, in conjunction with H. M. Varian, superintendent of Great Lakes Engineering Works. The vessel was powered by 4 Nordberg direct-drive diesel engines, each connected to a propeller through a Westinghouse electro-magnetic coupling, generating a total of nearly 10,000 horsepower. Christened in 1951 by 14-year-old Barbara Ziegler, the daughter of Michigan's Highway Commissioner, Charles M. Ziegler, Vacationland was the last ship built for the Highway Department ferry operation. It was designed to carry 150 automobiles, to relieve heavy traffic congestion at the Straits during the summer season, and also to serve as an icebreaker during winter months to keep the route open all year. Prior to Vacationlands arrival, starting in 1923, the Highway Department operated a fleet of coal-fired steamers, several of which were former railroad ferries, purchased second hand from Lake Michigan operators. In winter months, to perform the icebreaking, the state had also chartered the railroad ferry, Sainte Marie (II), which had to land at separate docking facilities on each side of the Straits. A \\"double-ender\\" capable of operating equally well in either forward or reverse, Vacationland was long, wide, and had room for 600 passengers in observation lounges at either end of her spar deck. The autos were carried below on a fully enclosed car deck. She operated with a crew of 47 men, who worked three shifts throughout the year. Her captain for most of her Michigan service was Frank U. Nelson. After the opening of the Mackinac Bridge in 1957, Vacationland was mothballed for three years before being sold. She made the last official Michigan State Ferry crossing of the Straits of Mackinac on November 1, 1957, with a VIP cruise as part of the bridge opening ceremonies. She also made the very last crossing for Michigan State Ferries on November 2, 1957, when a single \\"deadhead\\" round-trip run was made to take supplies from Mackinaw City to the state warehouse in St. Ignace. She then was returned for layup in her slip in Mackinaw City. The deadhead run was commanded by her Second Mate, Gerald Cronan, of St. Ignace, as all her other officers had already left to take other employment. Sunshine Coast Queen in BC Ferries service (1975) In 1960 she was sold to the Detroit Atlantic Navigation Company of Detroit, and was renamed Jack Dalton. That operation, carrying truck trailers between Detroit and Cleveland, was short-lived, and Michigan took her back for non-payment. She was sold next to Canadian operators, Compagnie de Navigation Nord-Sud, (North-South Navigation Company) on the St. Lawrence River, where she operated between Pointe-au-Père (Rimouski) and Baie-Comeau from 1961 to 1966 as the Père Nouvel. As such, she was modified to include a cafeteria and bar/lounge in one observation room. The service inaugurated the first crossing of the eastern St. Lawrence River and was very popular. In 1967 she was sold again to BC Ferries, of Victoria, British Columbia. They sailed the ship through the Panama Canal to Victoria and renamed the ferry as the Sunshine Coast Queen. The Suzy Q, as she was affectionately called, was modified to better fit BC landings, and increase passenger and vehicle capacity. She was lengthened by on each end to fit into BC dock wing walls, most crew quarters on her spar deck were removed to expand passenger lounges, and mezzanine decks were installed over the car deck for more vehicle space. A full service cafeteria replaced the snack bar and lounge installed in Quebec. As modified, she was long, and carried 186 autos and 800 passengers. She was assigned to the Horseshoe Bay (West Vancouver) to Langdale route across Howe Sound on the Sunshine Coast. She was BC Ferries first large double ended vessel. Retired due to increasing traffic and high operating costs in 1977 after the first Arab oil embargo, she was again laid up. Sold to Canaarctic Ventures, the company planned to convert the ferry to an oil-drilling support ship on Alaska's North Slope as the Gulf Kanayak. The oil embargo ended, however, and the ferry remained laid up until 1987. That year, she was sold to Chenco, Inc, and was sent to scrap in Nantong, China. The ship did not make it; the Gulf Kanayak sank while under tow of the Hoshin #8, in a Pacific storm on December 3, 1987. Today the wreck lies in about of water, in the Pacific Ocean, nearly off the mouth of the Columbia River.

It neighbours Roundhill Reservoir and is about west of Masham. It takes its name from the nearby village of Leighton. Water from the reservoir is used to compensate for abstraction from the River Ure. Although not in Nidderdale, the reservoir is within the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Leighton is accessible for fishing and has a car park. The reservoir is on land owned by the Swinton Estate and they stock the waters with fish. Like its near neighbours in Upper Nidderdale, the construction of Leighton reservoir (and Roundhill) necessitated the building of an industrial railway to bring in materials for construction. A railway was built from the north end of Masham railway station where a transhipment yard was located to transfer freight between the narrow and standard gauge lines.

Cash flow is the life-blood of all businesses—particularly start-ups and small enterprises. As a result, it is essential that management forecast (predict) what is going to happen to cash flow to make sure the business has sufficient funds to survive. How often management should forecast cash flow is dependent on the financial security of the business. If the business is struggling, or is keeping a watchful eye on its finances, the business owner should be forecasting and revising his or her cash flow on a daily basis. However, if the finances of the business are more stable and 'safe', then forecasting and revising cash flow weekly or monthly is enough. Here are the key reasons why a cash flow forecast is so important: * Identify potential shortfalls in cash balances in advance—think of the cash flow forecast as an \\"early warning system\\". This is, by far, the most important reason for a cash flow forecast. * Make sure that the business can afford to pay suppliers and employees. Suppliers who don't get paid will soon stop supplying the business; it is even worse if employees are not paid on time. * Spot problems with customer payments—preparing the forecast encourages the business to look at how quickly customers are paying their debts. Note—this is not really a problem for businesses (like retailers) that take most of their sales in cash/credit cards at the point of sale. * As an important discipline of financial planning—the cash flow forecast is an important management process, similar to preparing business budgets. * External stakeholders such as banks may require a regular forecast. Certainly, if the business has a bank loan, the bank will want to look at the cash flow forecast at regular intervals. Corporate finance ;Definition In the context of corporate finance, cash flow forecasting is the modeling of a company or entity's future financial liquidity over a specific timeframe. Cash usually refers to the company's total bank balances, but often what is forecast is treasury position which is cash plus short-term investments minus short-term debt. Cash flow is the change in cash or treasury position from one period to the next period. ;Methods The direct method of cash flow forecasting schedules the company's cash receipts and disbursements (R&D;). Receipts are primarily the collection of accounts receivable from recent sales, but also include sales of other assets, proceeds of financing, etc. Disbursements include payroll, payment of accounts payable from recent purchases, dividends and interest on debt. This direct R&D; method is best suited to the short-term forecasting horizon of 30 days or so because this is the period for which actual, as opposed to projected, data is available.Tony de Caux, \\"Cash Forecasting\\", Treasurer's Companion, Association of Corporate Treasurers, 2005 The three indirect methods are based on the company's projected income statements and balance sheets. * The adjusted net income (ANI) method starts with operating income (EBIT or EBITDA) and adds or subtracts changes in balance sheet accounts such as receivables, payables and inventories to project cash flow. * The pro-forma balance sheet (PBS) method looks straight at the projected book cash account; if all the other balance sheet accounts have been correctly forecast, cash will be correct, too. Both the ANI and PBS methods are best suited to the medium-term (up to one year) and long-term (multiple years) forecasting horizons. Both are limited to the monthly or quarterly intervals of the financial plan, and need to be adjusted for the difference between accrual-accounting book cash and the often-significantly- different bank balances.Cash Flow Forecasting, Association for Financial Professionals, 2006 * The third indirect approach is the accrual reversal method (ARM), which is similar to the ANI method. But instead of using projected balance sheet accounts, large accruals are reversed and cash effects are calculated based upon statistical distributions and algorithms. This allows the forecasting period to be weekly or even daily. It also eliminates the cumulative errors inherent in the direct, R&D; method when it is extended beyond the short-term horizon. But because the ARM allocates both accrual reversals and cash effects to weeks or days, it is more complicated than the ANI or PBS indirect methods. The ARM is best suited to the medium-term forecasting horizon.Richard Bort, \\"Medium-Term Funds Flow Forecasting\\", Corporate Cash Management Handbook, Warren Gorham & Lamont, 1990 ;Uses A cash flow projection is an important input into valuation of assets, budgeting and determining appropriate capital structures in LBOs and leveraged recapitalizations. ₳ Entrepreneurial ;Definition In the context of entrepreneurs or managers of small and medium enterprises, cash flow forecasting may be somewhat simpler, planning what cash will come into the business or business unit in order to ensure that outgoing can be managed so as to avoid them exceeding cashflow coming in. Entrepreneurs need to learn quickly that \\"Cash is king\\" and, therefore, they must become good at cashflow forecasting. ;Methods The simplest method is to have a spreadsheet that shows cash coming in from all sources out to at least 90 days, and all cash going out for the same period. This requires that the quantity and timings of receipts of cash from sales are reasonably accurate, which in turn requires judgement honed by experience of the industry concerned, because it is rare for cash receipts to match sales forecasts exactly, and it is also rare for customers all to pay on time. These principles remain constant whether the cash flow forecasting is done on a spreadsheet or on paper or on some other IT system. A danger of using too much corporate finance theoretical methods in cash flow forecasting for managing a business is that there can be non cash items in the cashflow as reported under financial accounting standards. This goes to the heart of the difference between financial accounting and management accounting.

He is founder of Animal Wellness Action, a 501(c)(4) organization, that promotes legal standards against cruelty and he is president of the Center for a Humane Economy, a 501(c)(3) organization that urges businesses to adopt animal- friendly practices when it comes to their supply chains, research and development, and other operations. He was the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). Pacelle took office June 1, 2004, after serving for nearly 10 years as the organization's chief lobbyist and spokesperson. While the HSUS board voted overwhelmingly to keep Pacelle on as CEO, he chose to resign on February 2, 2018, after uncorroborated accusations of sexual harassment against him. Pacelle has vociferously denied these accusations.  Family and early life  Pacelle was born in New Haven, Connecticut, of Greek and Italian descent. His parents are Richard L. Pacelle Sr., and Patricia Pacelle. Pacelle is the youngest of four children. His older brother, Richard L. Pacelle Jr., is a political science professor at The University of Tennessee. Growing up in New Haven, Pacelle enjoyed reading natural history as a child and developed an early concern about mistreatment of animals. He attended Notre Dame High School and graduated with degrees in history and environmental studies from Yale University, where William Cronon served as his adviser. Pacelle's environmental studies sensitized him to the fact that \\"a destructive attitude toward animals in the natural world, along with innovations in technology, could produce colossal damage to animals and ecosystems\\". His activism led to his appointment in 1989, at age 23, as Executive Director of The Fund for Animals, the organization founded by Cleveland Amory.  Career with the Humane Society of the United States  Wayne Pacelle at a book signing event, Ann Arbor, Michigan Pacelle has been instrumental in securing the passage of dozens of federal statutes and amendments to protect animals, including laws to increase penalties for harming law enforcement animals, protect great apes in their native habitats (2000), halt interstate transport of fighting animals (2002), halt commerce in big cats for the pet trade (2003), require government agencies to include pets in disaster planning (2006), make interstate transport of fighting animals a felony (2007), ban the import of puppy mill dogs from abroad (2008), mandate accurate labeling of fur garments (2010), outlaw cruel \\"animal crush\\" videos (2010), elevate protection for sharks from the practice of finning (2011), make it a spectator to be at an animal fight (2013), ban the sale of dog and cat meat in the U.S. (2018), pass national ban on animal fighting (2019), and establish a federal anti-cruelty statute (2019). Pacelle has testified before U.S. House and Senate committees on a wide animal protection issues, including farm animal welfare, \\"canned hunting\\", the treatment of downer cows, funding for the Animal Welfare Act and other programs, trophy hunting of threatened and endangered species, cockfighting and dogfighting, puppy mills, the exotic pet trade, bear baiting, and chronic wasting disease. The animal protection organizations he's led have helped pass more than 1,000 state statutes during his tenure as a leader. Pacelle has been associated with 26 successful statewide ballot initiatives to protect animals, including measures to prohibit cockfighting, prohibit mourning dove hunting, restrict steel traps and certain poisons, and ban certain farming methods. He has also been instrumental in the passage of numerous state laws dealing with animal protection. In addition, he has been vocal in criticizing individuals and groups who he says resort to intimidation, vandalism, or violence in pursuit of animal protection goals. Under Pacelle's direction, the HSUS has secured the adoption of \\"cage-free\\" egg-purchasing policies by several hundred universities and corporations; the phase-out of gestation crates by key pork producers nationwide; the exposure of an international trophy hunting scam; successful congressional votes and litigation to end horse slaughter; and an agreement from the United States Department of Agriculture to begin enforcement of federal laws concerning the transportation of farm animals. In addition, the HSUS's campaign to stop the killing of seal pups in Canada secured pledges to boycott Canadian seafood from more than 1,000 restaurants and grocery stores and 300,000 individuals. ; Animal cruelty In early 2008, the HSUS's investigation of animal treatment at the Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company sparked the largest beef recall in American history and congressional calls for reform of the slaughterhouse inspection system. In late February 2008, Pacelle testified on the downer cow issue before a subcommittee of the Senate Agriculture Committee on a panel with USDA Secretary Edward Schafer. ; Successes Two November 2006 ballot initiatives conducted with HSUS's support outlawed dove hunting in Michigan and abusive farming practices in Arizona. In January, 2007, several months after passage of the Arizona ballot measure, Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the world, announced that it would phase out the use of gestation crates that immobilize pregnant sows through confinement. During the same month, Maple Leaf Foods, Canada's largest pork producer, did the same. The Strauss Veal company also followed suit. ; Agreement with United Egg Producers In 2011, Pacelle and Chad Gregory of the United Egg Producers (UEP) agreed to work together in support of federal hen welfare legislation. This agreement expired in 2013 after the bill supported by the UEP and The HSUS failed to pass. ; Agreement with Sea World In March 2016, Pacelle and SeaWorld CEO Joel Manby forged an agreement to cooperate on several issues of mutual concern, and SeaWorld agreed to phase out its use of orca whales in performance, to end breeding of captive orcas, and to implement reforms including the introduction of humanely raised products to menus at SeaWorld's theme parks. ; Humane Society Legislative Fund Pacelle is a cofounder of the Humane Society Legislative Fund (HSLF), a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization that lobbies for animal welfare legislation and works to elect humane-minded candidates to public office. He also cofounded Humane USA, a nonpartisan political action committee (PAC) that supports candidates of any political party based on their support for animal protection. These two organizations helped defeat lawmakers in Congress they consider hostile to animals, including Rep. Chris John of Louisiana (2004), Rep. Richard Pombo of California (2006), and Senator Conrad Burns of Montana (2006). ; Corporate combinations The HSUS experienced major growth since 2004, primarily as a result of corporate combinations Pacelle forged with The Fund for Animals in 2005 and the Doris Day Animal League in 2006. During the first 30 months of Pacelle's tenure, overall revenues and expenditures grew by more than 50 percent. HSUS's annual budget for 2006 was $103 million. The organization claims nearly 10 million members and constituents.  Criticism  HSUS has faced criticism from various groups during Pacelle's tenure, including the Center for Consumer Freedom, which receives money from the food industry, and Protect the Harvest, which is funded by oilman Forrest Lucas. Pacelle's Resignation In 2018, Chronicle of Philanthropy reported that Pacelle was under investigation for a \\"sexual relationship with an employee\\".https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Humane-Society-CEO-Under/242342 In December 2018 HSUS launched an internal investigation, hiring the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius to investigate three separate allegations of sexual harassment. Investigators found that the charity had offered settlements to three additional individuals who alleged they were dismissed or demoted after reporting instances of harassment by Pacelle. The New York Times subsequently reported on an interview with a Humane Society employee who alleges Pacelle sexually assaulted her in his office.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/humane-society-ceo-sexual- harassment-.html Pacelle has denied each allegation. The investigation also included female leaders who allegedly said their \\"warnings about his conduct went unheeded.\\" The HSUS voted at the end of January 2019 to retain Pacelle as CEO, prompting seven board members to resign in protest. Other donors threatened to sever ties with the organization, insisting that Pacelle should resign instead. Donors like the Greenbaum Foundation, which donated nearly $100,000 to the HSUS in 2017, claimed they would likely stop funding the HSUS because of the board’s handling the allegations against Pacelle. Other donors such as Nicole Brodeur had stopped providing funding when allegations came to light in October 2017. Facing internal and external dissent, Pacelle resigned on February 2, 2018. Some defended Pacelle's placement as CEO. The Washington Post's Kathleen Parker offered support in the wake of Pacelle's resignation, claiming that it was not necessarily the best \\"for the organization he built or the animals it has served...\\" and thanked Pacelle for his \\"stewardship, advocacy and legendary work ethic.\\" She added \\"No person is all one thing, good or bad, and Pacelle is no exception.\\" Other affiliates of the organization supported Pacelle's resignation, claiming that the HSUS board had put Pacelle's fundraising abilities above concerns for other employees in their evaluation of the evidence against Pacelle. Iowa director Josh Skipworth claimed that it was \\"ridiculous to put the business outlook over the female employees\\" in the board's original decision to retain Pacelle as CEO. In March 2018, The Washington Post reported on the aftermath of Pacelle's resignation; the article details additional allegations of sexual harassment and assault involving Pacelle.https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-humane- societys-sexual-harassment-scandal-just-wont- end/2018/03/23/52b8e996-1647-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html  Food and agriculture industries  The Center for Consumer Freedom has criticized Pacelle for holding animal-rights views, arguing, \\"When Wayne Pacelle took over, it ceased being an animal welfare group and suddenly became an animal rights group.\\" Under Pacelle, HSUS created state agriculture advisory councils. Members of the agriculture councils have criticized the direction of HSUS, arguing that the agriculture councils' influence has waned while more radical elements of HSUS have gained influence. One Nebraska rancher and spokesperson for the agriculture councils claimed that Pacelle allowed HSUS to become a \\"good ol' boys vegan club.\\"  No Kill  Nathan Winograd, a leader of the no-kill movement seeking to end most euthanasia in animal shelters, has been a critic of Pacelle, saying, \\"We have learned what we can expect under Mr. Pacelle's tenure. Platitudes, cliches, rhetoric, pretty words. But we cannot expect solutions.\\" Personal life Wayne Pacelle is married to TV journalist Lisa Fletcher. Recognition Pacelle has been the subject of profiles by the New York Times Magazine (2008), the Los Angeles Times (2008), The New York Times (2007), The Wall Street Journal (2006), The Washington Post (2004), Newsweek (2007), and other major publications. In 2014, he was named one of the Non-Profit Times' \\"Power and Influence Top 50.\\" The citation read, \\"He has played a role in the passage of more than two-dozen federal statutes and 26 successful statewide ballot initiatives, which is why he is a punching bag for puppy mills and pseudo-PR firms that profit from animal cruelty.\\" For his management of HSUS's response to Hurricane Katrina, The NonProfit Times named Pacelle \\"Executive of the Year\\" (2005). In 2008, Pacelle also received a Special Achievement Award for Humanitarian Service from the National Italian American Foundation. The same year, Supermarket News named Pacelle one of its \\"Power 50\\", citing his leadership on farm animal welfare issues. In 2018, Pacelle was noted in the book Rescuing Ladybugs Jennifer Skiff, Rescuing Ladybugs: Inspirational Encounters with Animals That Changed the World, New World Library, 2018 by author and animal advocate Jennifer Skiff as having “arguably orchestrated more positive legal change for animals than any human being in modern times, during the period he was head of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) from 2004 to 2018.” Ibid, page 163  Books  ; The Humane Economy Published in April 2016, Pacelle's book The Humane Economy: How Innovators and Enlightened Consumers are Transforming the Lives of Animals argues that every business involving animal use is susceptible to disruption and that there are new opportunities to displace or modify animal use while creating wealth and enhancing animal welfare. Jack Welch called it \\"a critically important read for anyone who cares about business success or animals -- or, like so many of us, both.\\" * The book was on the New York Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times best-seller lists. ; The Bond Published in April 2011, Pacelle's book The Bond: Our Kinship with Animals, Our Call to Defend Them is an exploration of mankind's bond with animals, and a call to respond to the needs of at-risk animals. Jane Goodall says of this book, \\"If the animals knew about this book, they would, without doubt, confer on Wayne Pacelle, their highest honor.\\" The book debuted at #11 on The New York Times, #8 on the Los Angeles Times, and #8 on The Washington Post best- seller lists. * In addition to The Humane Economy and The Bond, Pacelle has contributed to the following books: * Foreword by Wayne Pacelle. * Introduction by Jane Goodall; Afterword by Wayne Pacelle. * (From the Foreword by Wayne Pacelle.) * A book about Cleveland Amory.

He was born in Nawfia, Anambra State and attended a primary school nearby. Business life He started trading in palm kernel during the early 1920s and sold most of the produce to the Niger company. He later plunged into other ventures such as trading in bicycle spare parts and ragoon rice but he later discovered that expatriate firms were formidable competitors who had the potential, connections and resources to drive out their competitors. To find himself a niche, he started importing gramophones for the local recording industry. Expatriate competition was little as the industry was dominated by varied local artists and companies with limited official support. With the help of a few European companies he obtained the facility to help record vernacular tapes abroad. In a few years, he became one of the largest distributors of recorded tapes in Nigeria. After the end of World War II, most of his foreign partners who were located in Europe reneged on their distributional deals. Christopher then decided to build his own factory. However, it took a long time before the factory became a reality. In 1961, he formed a joint venture with Philips which became one of the largest records distributors and manufacturers in Nigeria.

It is also known as Knollwood Hall, Major Reynolds House, the Tucker Mansion and Bearden Hill. The home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The home and plantation were developed on land purchased from James White, the founder of Knoxville. Construction was supervised by Major Robert Reynolds' sister, Rebecca, while he was serving in the Mexican–American War. The house was completed in 1851. The home was originally built in the Federal style, but neoclassical details were added in the late 19th century. A later owner, Charles W. Griffith, added the distinctive front porch in 1919. Confederate General James Longstreet used the home as his headquarters in late 1863; he is reputed to have planned the Battle of Fort Sanders, part of the Knoxville Campaign, in the dining room. Knollwood was one of several antebellum plantations located along Kingston Pike in what was then western Knox County. Others included the Baker Peters House, Armstrong-Lockett House (Crescent Bend), Bleak House, and the Mabry Hood House (now demolished). Architecturally, Knollwood has a more significant presence than the Baker Peters House and Mabry Hood House. The Harvey Tucker family, wealthy Knoxvillians involved in the hospitality industry (i.e., Quality Courts, now part of Choice Hotels, Inc.), owned the house in the mid- to-late 20th century. Through the era when the Tucker family lived at Knollwood, the sweeping front lawn remained undeveloped. The house was known informally as the Tucker Mansion in this era. The plantation itself and the front lawn no longer exist, due to surrounding development. The mansion, itself, survives and has been renovated, but it now serves as the headquarters for Schaad Companies. It is not open to the public, but has been used by Knox Heritage for a social event.

To write the novel, Lem received advance payment from publishing house Czytelnik (Warsaw). The book became an instant success and was translated into several languages (first into Czech, which was published in 1956). This success convinced Lem to switch to the career of a science-fiction author. The Astronauts, written for the youth, is set in the Communist utopian future. To get it published under the communist regime in Poland, Lem had to insert frequent references to the ideals of communism. Decades later, Lem declared about The Astronauts: The inability to ever understand alien civilizations, a frequent theme of Lem's future works, appears here for the first time. Plot summary The introduction describes the fall of the Tunguska meteorite (1908) and the subsequent expedition of Leonid Kulik. The hypothesis about the crash of a spaceship is mentioned. Fast-forward to the year 2003. Communism has emerged as the worldwide form of government and humankind, freed from oppression and chaos, is engaged in gigantic engineering projects such as irrigation of the Sahara, construction of a hydro-energetic plant over the Strait of Gibraltar, and the ability to control the climate. The latest project is to thaw the Antarctic and Arctic regions by artificial nuclear- powered \\"suns\\" circling above. During the preparation of earthworks in the Tunguska area, a strange object is found and later identified as an extraterrestrial data record. The record contains details about the travel of a spaceship from Venus (which crashed in Tunguska) and the data record ends with an ominous message: \\"After two rotations the Earth will be radiated. When the radiation intensity drops to half, the Great Movement will commence.\\" Scared, the government of the Earth (consisting of scientists) decides to send a newly built spaceship, the Kosmokrator (equipped with a vacuum tube-based computer called Marax) to Venus. After a few weeks, the international crew of the Kosmokrator arrives on Venus but finds no traces of life, only strange, half-destroyed technological structures like the \\"White Globe\\", a giant anti- gravity device. It turns out that Venus was inhabited by a warlike civilization planning to occupy the Earth. However, before they managed to destroy life on Earth, they themselves perished in a nuclear civil war, leaving only ruins of cities and scattered electronic records. Film adaptations In 1960 the film Der Schweigende Stern (The Silent Star, Milcząca Gwiazda in Polish), based on the novel, was shot in East Germany and was directed by Kurt Maetzig. Lem was extremely critical of the film.\\"Filmowe światy Stanisława Lema\\", citing Lem's interview, published in book Thus Spoke...

That plan involved leading the Chechen separatist fighters to believe that a safe exit would be possible out of the city to the mountains in the south of Chechnya. On February 2, 2000, they were allowed to leave the city and were then caught in minefields and attacked by federal artillery and the air force. Fleeing the ambush, a large group of armed fighters arrived in Katyr-Yurt . Journalists who managed to report on the area confirmed the use, by the Russians, of the vacuum bomb on the town.Lester W. Grau and Timothy L. Thomas(2000)\\"Russian Lessons Learned From the Battles For Grozny \\" Vacuum bombs are dropped by parachute, and, when a couple of meters from the ground, release a cloud of petrol gas. The gas then reacts with the air, causing an explosion and then a vacuum, sucking away oxygen from living people, thus killing them. The residents, including many civilian refugees who had fled the fighting Grozny, were not warned in advance or told of safe exit routes by the Russian side. The sudden heavy bombardment of the village began in the early hours of the morning and subsided at approximately 3 p.m. At that time, many of the villagers attempted to leave, believing that the military had granted a safe passage out of the village. As they were leaving by road, planes appeared and bombed the cars. The final atrocity came in the afternoon of February 4. The Russians told the Chechens they would be able to leave in a convoy of buses with white flags attached. The convoy which the Russians themselves dispatched for the Chechens was then bombed by the Russians.Wood, Tony. Chechnya: The Case for Independence. Page 101 Ultimately, the bombing lasted for two days and resulted in the deaths of at least 170 civilians (some 363 according to one estimateRevealed: Russia's worst war crime in Chechnya, The Guardian, March 5, 2000), all of them formally citizens of Russia. Many more were injured.

It is managed by the London Borough of Croydon. It was part of the old parish of Addington before the suburb of Shirley was developed in the 1930s. The site consists largely of woodland on a gravel bed, with London's largest area of heathland at its heart. It is a Site of Metropolitan Importance. In the mid-18th century, it was a noted cricket venue used by the then-prominent Addington Cricket Club. Addington Hills and Croham Hurst, a short distance to the southwest, form popular open spaces in Croydon. It is a peaceful area with many pathways, close to central Croydon. There is a viewpoint with fine views across Croydon and across to north London, including Docklands and Parliament Hill. It is served by Coombe Lane tram stop on the London Tramlink route to New Addington which runs along the southern edge of the land. The park covers an area of . The London Loop path runs through the park. The park is fully accessible at all times.  Description  A path across Addington Hills Tramlink tram no 2538 eastbound, climbs towards the Coombe Lane tram stop Addington Hills reaches 460 feet (140 m) above sea level. The terrain drops sharply to the north, exposing the hills' pebbly compositionThe plateau is mainly rolled chalk flints, see Outlines of the geology of England and Wales, William Daniel Conybeare at the end of the gullies. Addington Hills borders Coombe Park / Lloyd Park on its west and Coombe Wood on its south. The area was originally called the hill of Pripledeane or Prible Dean, a name meaning \\"Gravel Valley\\" that came from the Middle English words prebel (\\"gravel\\") and dene (\\"valley\\"). The land was acquired by Croydon Board of Health in four parts over a 45-year period.  Facilities  Addington Hills facilities include: * Car parking – off Shirley Hills Road and Oaks Road, at the junction with Coombe Lane * London Loop path * Chinese restaurant * Horse rides * Viewpoint Cricket venue The first definite mention of Addington Hills in a cricket connection is a 1745 match there on Thursday, 23 May between Addington and London. Little about the match is known except that Addington won. The venue was used for matches on at least four occasions between 1745 and 1752, a period which coincided with Addington Cricket Club having one of the strongest teams in England. The last match known to have been played there was Addington v Dartford on 12 August 1752. Wildlife The heathland areas are dominated by heather and gorse, with some bilberry and goldenrod. Drier spots are indicated by the occurrence of bell heather. Fine-leaved fescues, wavy hair-grass and purple moor-grass dominate the acid grassland areas with a mix of wood sage, heath bedstraw and other typical species. Marsh violet and hard fern (both London rarities) occur in the damper areas.Taken from London Heathland Heritage website Croydon page Burrowing bees and wasps occur in the bare patches of soil and the bushy heathers and acid-loving grasses provide home to a wide range of insects, spiders and other invertebrates, each well adapted to the warm, dry conditions at ground level.Adapted from London Biodiversity Partnership / London's Heathland Heritage / Croydon Council information board near the Addington Hills car park. The invertebrate fauna plays an important part in supporting a range of birds and reptiles – and all benefit from the varied mosaic of open and scrubland habitats. In open areas, common lizards and slowworms thrive. Green woodpeckers may be seen in the woods and on the heath, and goldcrests among the woodland edges and in the gorse. Habitats The northern area of woodland is by far the oldest, in particular the very old oak pollards near Oaks Road. Other wooded areas are comparatively recent, and the small pine plantations near the southern boundary were only established during the mid-19th century. Until the 1920s, there were only a few scattered oak, pine and birch on the hills, which were then almost entirely covered in heather. Now there is far more extensive tree cover, and heather is limited to the slopes and ridges where it tolerates the harsh conditions provided by the very dry and acidic poor soil.

Its formation had been advanced at the Champoeg Meetings since February 17, 1841, and it existed from May 2, 1843 until March 3, 1849, and provided a legal system and a common defense amongst the mostly American pioneers settling an area then inhabited only by the many Indigenous Nations. Much of the region's geography and many of the Natives were not known by people of European descent until several exploratory tours were authorized at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries. The Organic Laws of Oregon were adopted in 1843 with its preamble stating that settlers only agreed to the laws \\"until such time as the United States of America extend their jurisdiction over us.\\" According to a message from the government in 1844, the rising settler population was beginning to flourish among the \\"savages\\", who were \\"the chief obstruction to the entrance of civilization\\" in a land of \\"ignorance and idolatry.\\" The government had three branches that included a legislature, judiciary, and executive branch. The executive branch was first the Executive Committee, consisting of three members, in effect from 1843 to 1845; in 1845, a governor replaced the committee. The judicial branch had a single Supreme Judge along with several lower courts, and a legislative committee of nine served as a legislature until 1845 when the Oregon House of Representatives was established. Background A series frontiersmen assemblies were held over several years across the Willamette Valley, with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left neither a will or had an heir in Oregon Country, left the future of his property uncertain.Horner, John B. Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. Portland: The J.K. Gill Co. 1919 Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised to discuss the matter on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor.Grover, La Fayette, The Oregon Archives, Salem: A. Bush, 1853 French- Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed. Further attempts of a pioneer government floundered until the numbers of American increased from travel over the Oregon Trail. Initiated by William Gray, the \\"Wolf Meetings\\" of early 1843 created a bounty system on predators of settler livestock. Further discussions began among the settlers until a gathering was held at Champoeg on May 2, with under 150 Americans and French-Canadians participating.Bancroft, Hubert and Frances Fuller Victor. History of Oregon. Vol. 1. San Francisco: History Co., 1890. The proposal for forming a provisional government was tabled and voted on twice. The first vote rejected the presented report due to the inclusion of a governor, with a second vote on each individual item proposed.Loewenberg, Robert J. \\"Creating a Provisional Government in Oregon: A Revision.\\" The Pacific Northwest Quarterly 68, No. 1 (1977), pp. 20-22 On 5 July 1843 the Organic Laws of Oregon, modeled after Iowa's Organic Law and the Ordinance of 1787, were adopted by colonists of the Willamette Valley, establishing the Provisional Government of Oregon. The government was, according to pioneers Overton Johnson and William H. Winter, intended from the start as an interim entity, until \\"whenever [the United States] extends her jurisdiction over the Territory.\\" (Johnson would go on to serve as Recorder for the provisional government for a few months in 1844.) Structure The Organic Laws were drafted by a legislative committee on May 16, 1843 and June 28, 1843, before being adopted on July 5.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. Although not a formal constitution, the document outlined the laws of the government. Two years later, on July 2, 1845, a new set of Organic Laws was drafted to revise and clarify the previous version; this newer version was adopted by a majority vote of the people on July 26, 1845. This constitution-like document divided the government into three departments: a judiciary branch, an executive branch, and a legislature. The definition of the executive branch had previously been modified, in late 1844, from a three-person committee to a single governor; this change took effect in 1845. When appealing for military aid from the American Government in the aftermath of the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: > The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and > the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the > ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that > stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This > union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a > monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of > allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong > party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a > government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.Memorial of > Legislative Assembly of Oregon Territory relative to their present situation > and wants. in Miscellaneous Documents Printed by Order of the House of > Representatives, during the First Session of the Thirtieth Congress... Vol. > 1. Washington: Tippin & Streeper, 1848. p. 5. Executive branch George Abernethy, Governor from 1845 to 1849 With the first set of laws, the people created a three-person Executive Committee to act as an executive.The Organic Act in Grover, Lafayette. The Oregon Archives. Salem: A. Bush. 1853, pp. 26-35 The Second Executive Committee was elected on May 14, 1844, and served until June 12, 1845. A December 1844 amendment of the Organic Laws eliminated the Executive Committee in favor of a single governor, taking effect in June 1845. At that time George Abernethy was elected as the first governor. Abernethy would be the only governor under the Provisional Government. He was reelected in 1847, and served until 1849. Legislative branch Morton M. McCarver, Speaker in 1844 and 1845 The Provisional Legislature held session mainly in Oregon City.Clarke, S. A. Pioneer Days of Oregon History, Volume 2. Portland, OR: J.K. Gill Co. 1905 They met at different times each year, and in 1848 they did not meet; too many members had left for the California gold fields. The legislature enacted various laws, sent memorials to Congress, incorporated towns and organizations, and granted divorces and licenses to run ferries. After the establishment of the Oregon Territory, the legislature was replaced with the two house Oregon Territorial Legislature. Judicial branch James W. Nesmith, Supreme Judge from 1844 and 1845 The Provisional Government also included a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed. This Supreme Court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original jurisdictional matters when the amount in controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith. Districts During its existence the Provisional Government's authority was restricted to the pioneer settlements, generally located in or around the Willamette Valley. The entire Oregon Country was decreed to be covered by four administrative divisions. Initially created on 5 July 1843 were the Twality, Yamhill, Clackamas and Champooick (later Champoeg) districts. Yamhill district claimed the lands west of the Willamette River and a line extending from its course, and south of the Yamhill River. Champooick District was adjacent to the east, its northern border the confluence of the Pudding and Molalla Rivers. Twality District was directly north of Yamhill District, its eastern border extending from the mouth of the Willamette River. Clackamas District was to contain \\"all the territory\\" that wasn't decreed a part of the other three districts, located east of Twality District and north of Champooick District. The extent of land claimed north was vague, being \\"south of the northern boundary of the United States\\". Despite this the government was defined to extend over all the lands east to the Rocky Mountains and north of the Mexican territory of Alta California. Throughout 1843 and 1844, no attempts were made at controlling lands north of the Columbia River, then under the influence of the Hudson's Bay Company through Fort Vancouver.Clark, Robert C. \\"Last Step in Provisional Government.\\" The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society 16, No. 4 (1915), pp. 313-329 In June 1844 the Columbia River was declared as the northern border of the Provisional Government, but by December the most expansive American claim in the Oregon boundary dispute of Parallel 54°40′ north was adopted.Oregon Territorial Government. Laws of a General and Local Nature passed by the Legislative Committee and Legislative Assembly. Salem, OR: Asahel Bush. 1853. On December 22, 1845 districts were renamed to counties. Additional districts were created over time from the original four, including the Clatsop, Vancouver, Linn, Clark, Polk, Benton counties. Other Other government positions included Recorder, Treasurer, Attorney, and Sheriff. The recorder position would later become the position of Secretary of State. Laws Main settlements in the area. With the formation of the Provisional Government, a committee of nine individuals were elected to frame the laws of the government. This Legislative Committee consisted of David Hill, Robert Shortess, Alanson Beers, William H. Gray, James A. O'Neil, Robert Newell, Thomas J. Hubbard, William Dougherty, and Robert Moore who was elected as the chairman of the committee. Each member was to be paid $1.25 per day for their services with the first meeting held May 15, 1843. On July 4 a new gathering began at Champoeg with speeches for and against the proposals of the committee. Then on July 5, 1843 the Organic Laws of Oregon are adopted by popular vote after being recommended by the Legislative Committee, with the laws modeled after Iowa's Organic Law and the Ordinance of 1787, creating the de facto first Oregon constitution. Scholars and historians have appraised the First Organic Laws as being \\"very crude and unsatisfactory\\", not allowing for an effective government body to function. Over the course of nearly six years under the provisional government, the settlers passed numerous laws. One law allowed people to claim if they improved the land, which would be solidified later by Congress’ adoption of the Donation Land Claim Act. Another law allowed the government to organize a militia and call them out by order of the Executive or Legislature. Under the first Organic Laws of 1843 inhabitants were guaranteed due process of law and a right to a trial by jury. Some other rights established were: no cruel and unusual punishment, no unreasonable bails for defendants, and no takings of property without compensation. Following the Cockstock Incident in 1844, the legislature decreed that African Americans could not reside in the Oregon Country, only David Hill and Asa Lovejoy voting against the bill. The punishment for any freemen was to be administered every six months of their residency being \\"not less than twenty nor more than thirty-nine stripes\\". The law was never actually enforced and was struck down in July 1845. However, in 1849 the legislature passed a new law once again prohibiting African Americans in the territory, but differed from the original 1844 law in that it applied to African Americans entering after it was passed, and it used different means to enforce it.Mcclintock, Thomas C. \\"James Saules, Peter Burnett, and the Oregon Black Exclusion Law of June 1844.\\" The Pacific Northwest Quarterly 86, No. 3 (1995), pp. 121-130 Despite facing legal discrimination that denied them suffrage and threatened violence, black pioneers remained in Oregon. While the USS Shark was in the region in 1846, its commanding officer estimated there were around 30 black settlers.Neil M. Howison. Oregon: Report of Lieut. Neil M. Howison, United States Navy, to the Commander of the Pacific Squadron Washington D.C.: Tippin & Streppen. 1848 In 1844, the legislature passed a law banning the sale of ardent spirits, out of concern that the Native Americans would become hostile if intoxicated. Finances Prior to the creation of the Provisional Government, the economic activities by in the Oregon European descendants Country were focused on the fur trade. A system called \\"wheat credit\\" was established in the 1830s for French-Canadian settlers on the French Prairie.Gilbert, James Henry. Trade and Currency in Early Oregon. New York City: MacMillan Co. 1907 The farmers would take their harvests to a granary in Champoeg, where a receipt for its market value was given, valid for use at HBC stores.Lyman, H. S. Reminiscences of F. X. Matthieu. Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society 1, No. 1 (1900), p. 102 Another item used for transactions by French-Canadian and later American pioneers were beaver skins.Scott, Leslie M. \\"Pioneer Gold Money, 1849.\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly 33, No. 1 (1932), pp. 25-30 The first Organic Laws only authorised voluntary donations, a measure deemed a \\"utopian scheme\\" and provided scant funds.Shippee, Lester B. \\"The Federal Relations of Oregon—VII.\\" The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society 20, No. 4 (1919), pp. 345-395 A tax on real estate and personal property was created in 1844, that covered a third of that year's expenses. The next year the property tax was doubled to .0025% and a 50¢ poll tax was levied as well, with failure to pay resulting in disenfranchisement. Sheriffs acted as tax collectors, but their position was made difficult due to the poverty or unwillingness of many colonists to pay what was owed. Taxes were paid in wheat and gathered at appointed locations for the district, largely HBC warehouses. A small amount of silver coins from Peru and Mexico freely circulated as legal tender. Minor financial agreements were completed in lieu of currency with assorted agricultural products, such as \\"wheat, hides, tallow, beef, pork, butter, lard, peas, lumber and other articles of export of the territory.\\"Strevey, T. Elmer. \\"The Oregon Mint.\\" The Washington Historical Quarterly 15, No. 4 (1924), pp. 276-284 One pioneer recalled the lack of currency, receiving at most 25¢ in transactions between 1844 and 1848.Oregon Pioneer Association. Transactions of the Twenty-Third Annual Reunion. Portland: George H. Himes and Co. 1895, p. 109 To overcome the lack of circulating coins, Abernethy gathered scraps of flint left over from arrowhead production by local indigenous.Oregon Native Son and Historical Magazine Vol. 1. Portland: Native Son Publishing Co. 1899, p. 90 After attaching scraps of paper to them, the amount owed by Abernethy was written on one and given to customers, transferable for other supplies at his store. Coins remained a prized item by settlers for example, during a sale of lots in Oregon City a property manager offered a discount of 50% if paid in specie.The Oregon Spectator (Oregon City), \\"Farm for sale\\", 21 January 1847, p. 3 A traveler who visited Oregon before the arrival of American merchants reported that HBC stores sold goods at rates lower than in the United States.Sage, Rufus B. Scenes in the Rocky Mountains. Philadelphia: Carey & Hart. 1846, p. 223 As merchants from the United States became established in the region, they chaffed under the economic hegemony of the HBC. The vendors pressed for the HBC to charge more for sales to pioneers, which the company did for two years, only for American customers. Joel Palmer reported that without the British company \\"the prices would be double what they are now.\\"Palmer, Joel and Reuben Gold Thwaites. Palmer's Journal of Travels over the Rocky Mountains, 1845-1846. Cleveland: Arthur H. Clark Co. 1906, pp. 217-218 The small American merchant class and officers of the HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund.The Oregon Spectator (Oregon City), \\"The Currency, 14 May 1846, p. 2 Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845.Oregon Acts and Laws New York City: N. A. Phemister Co.Gray, William H. A History of Oregon, 1972-1849. Portland: Harris & Holman. 1870, p. 437 The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers.The Oregon Spectator (Oregon City), \\"Repeal the Currency Law\\", 25 November 1847, p. 2 Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for wheat became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the creditors of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender. Around $8,000 from the poll and property taxes were collected over the course of the government, far short of the expenses amounting to $23,000. California After the Conquest of California during the ongoing Mexican–American War, American settlers began to move to the newly seized land. This created a demand for Oregonian wheat; proceeds from the sale of barrels of flour amounted to $10 per keg in 1847.The Oregon Spectator (Oregon City),\\"Letter from C. E. Picket of California...\\", 10 June 1847, p. 2 The start of the Gold Rush caused an immense rise in demand for various products in Californian markets. Economic transactions with the pioneer settlements of Oregon increased greatly, with the number of visiting vessels in 1849 was triple that of the previous eight years. Between 1848 and 1851 Oregon lumber and wheat sent to the new markets fetched rates two to three times higher than in 1847. Significant amounts of gold dust began to circulate in the Willamette Valley, though impurities were common. The Oregon Exchange Company was authorized by the legislature to begin producing Beaver Coins in early 1849,Carey, Charles H. History of Oregon. Portland: Pioneer Historical Publishing Co. 1922. p. 407 though production began on 10 March, a week after the dissolution of the Provisional Government. Settlement with the Hudson's Bay Company The mounting debts of the government, though it could \\"scarcely hope\\" to force the HBC company posts to adhere to its authority, made establishing an agreement with the HBC a priority. An employee of the company, Francis Ermatinger, was elected to the position of Treasurer in July after carrying the French-Canadian vote. In August Applegate inquired to Chief Factor John McLoughlin if the HBC would pay taxes and join the Provisional Government.Judson, Katharine B. \\"Dr. John McLoughlin's Last Letter to the Hudson's Bay Company, as Chief Factor, in charge at Fort Vancouver, 1845.\\" The American Historical Review 21, No. 1 (1915), pp. 104-134 At the same time a member of the legislature, David Hill, tabled a bill on 15 August that would deny any HBC employees citizenship or suffrage. The measure failed to pass, but demonstrated the feelings of the \\"Ultra-Americans\\" towards the company. While Applegate and McLoughlin held a conference, plans for the administration of the territory above the Columbia River, to be named Vancouver, were begun. The Chief Factor found the Provisional Government a satisfactory way to pursue the debts owed to the HBC by settlers, and protect company property against claim jumpers. Additionally he felt if the government were to openly declare independence from outside powers he could \\"be elected head were I to retire among them.\\" The negotiations ended with the condition that only sales with settlers would be taxed. Taxes paid to the Provisional Government by the HBC and the Puget Sound Agricultural Company amounted to $226 that year. Several more employees of the HBC were then included in the government. Chief Trader James Douglas was appointed as a justice for Vancouver after the signing of the agreement and in 1846 he and fellow employee Henry Peers were elected to the legislature. If there were any sessions of the Vancouver court, none of the records or correspondence remain. Claims were filed by British subjects covering the HBC forts of Vancouver, Cowlitz, and Nisqually. Vancouver in particular was covered by 18 claims. British reaction to the agreement was generally negative. It was seen as unneeded by William Peel, son of Prime Minister Peel, who arrived with small flotilla several days after its signing.Scott, Leslie M. \\"Report of Lieutenant Peel on Oregon in 1845-46.\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly 29, No. 1 (1928), pp. 51-76 Mervin Vavasour was in the Oregon Country gathering intelligence about the defensive capabilities of the HBC posts and voiced the minority view that the compact was to the benefit of \\"peace and prosperity of the community at large.\\"Schafer, Joseph. \\"Documents Relative to Warre and Vavasour's Military Reconnoissance in Oregon, 1845-6.\\" The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society 10, No. 1 (1909), pp. 1-99 Militia The organic laws laid out plans for a militia of a battalion of mounted riflemen commanded by an officer with the rank of major, with annual inspections. Every male settler between 16 and 60 who wanted to be \\"considered a citizen\\" had to be a part of the military, failure to do so would incur fines. (This remains so under modern Oregon law, though now both sexes are included, and the age range is only 18 to 45.)Oregon Revised Statutes 10§396. Published by the Legislative Counsel Committee of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. 2005. Retrieved on July 20, 2007. Under the first Organic Laws, power to call out the militia was vested in the Executive Committee, though any officer of the militia could also call them out in times of insurrection or invasion. Cayuse War In December 1847, after learning of the Whitman Massacre from HBC Chief Factor James Douglas, Governor Abernethy and the legislature met to discuss the situation. Major Henry A. G. Lee was placed in charge of a company called the Oregon Rifles on December 8 and was ordered to The Dalles. At that location the force established Fort Lee on December 21.Fagan, David D. 1885. History of Benton County, Oregon: including its geology, topography, ... Oregon: D.D. Fagan. An additional force of 500 men was to meet in Oregon City by December 25. This group prosecuted the war east of the Cascades under the command of Cornelius Gilliam. The war continued until five Cayuse emissaries, which according to Archbishop François Norbert Blanchet, were sent to \\"have a talk with the whites and explain all about the murderers, ten in number, who were no more, and had been killed by the whites, the Cayuses and were all dead.\\"Blanchet, François N. Historical Sketches of the Catholic Church in Oregon. Portland: 1878. pp. 182-184 However, the Cayuse party was imprisoned and transported to Oregon City. When the group was asked why they offered themselves to the militia, Tiloukaikt stated \\"Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people? So die we to save our people.\\" At a military court Tiloukait and the four other Cayuses, Tomahas, Klokamas, Isaiachalkis, and Kimasumpkinhese, were found guilty and hanged on June 3, 1850, at Oregon City. Subsequent history Signed on June 15, 1846, the Oregon Treaty ended the dispute between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States, by dividing the Oregon Country at the 49th parallel. This extended U.S. sovereignty over the region, but effective control would not occur until government officials arrived from the United States. Two years later, on August 14, 1848, the United States Congress created the Oregon Territory; this territory included today's states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. Appointed Governor of the Oregon Territory by President Polk, Joseph Lane arrived at Oregon City on 2 March 1849. Governor Lane kept the legal code of the dissolved provisional government, apart from immediately repealing the law authorizing the minting of the Beaver Coins, as this was incompatible with the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8). The creation of the Washington Territory in 1854 removed the northern half of the Oregon Territory.Evans, Elwood. Washington Territory: Her Past, Her Present, and the Elements of Wealth which Ensure Her Future. Olympia, WA: C.B. Bagley. 1877. pp. 15-17 Established on 14 February 1859, the State of Oregon was composed of roughly the western half of the territory, the remaining eastern section being added to the Washington Territory.

The conflict began in November 1572 when inhabitants of the city refused to receive Armand de Gontaut, baron de Biron, as royal governor. Beginning on 11 February 1573, the siege was led by the Duke of Anjou (the future Henry III). Political considerations following the duke's election to the throne of Poland in May 1573 resulted in negotiations, culminating on 24 June 1573, that lifted the siege on 6 July 1573.Jouanna, p.1391. The Edict of Boulogne signed shortly thereafter brought an end to this phase of the civil war. The siege of La Rochelle was contemporaneous with Catholic assaults on the cities of Sommières (led by Henri I de Montmorency) and Sancerre.  Background  La Rochelle at the time of the 1572–1573 siege Since 1568, La Rochelle had been the main base of the Huguenots in France. A city of 20,000 inhabitants and a port of strategic importance with historic links to England, La Rochelle benefited from administrative autonomy (lack of seigneur, bishop, or parlement) and had become overwhelmingly Huguenot (Calvinist). After the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and other massacres across France in the fall of 1572, numerous Huguenots fled to the city of La Rochelle as a last refuge.Jouanna, p.207. The city was well fortified, with access to the sea. The Siege The conflict started in November 1572 when inhabitants of the city refused to receive Armand de Gontaut, baron de Biron, as royal governor. Charles IX ordered the city to be besieged. In the middle of November, François de la Noue, sent by Charles IX to negotiate with the city, was invited by the inhabitants to take up their defense. With the king's acceptance, La Noue joined the besieged city, but was unable to effect a solution to the crisis, and on 12 March 1573 he left the city, to watch the subsequent events from the royal camp.Jouanna, p.209. Western side of La Rochelle with remaining towers of Vauclair castle and filled moats (center), by Antonius Lafreri, Rome, circa 1573. Montgomery in the upper left corner. On 11 February 1573, the Duke of Anjou arrived to take command of the siege with 28,000 men. His massive resources – munitions, cannons, gunpowder, cannonballs, food – were gathered from Paris, Picardy, Normandy, Poitou, Saintonge, and Angoumois. The army included the Duke's brother François d'Alençon; the two former leaders of the Huguenots, Henry of Navarre and Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé (both recently converted to Catholicism); members of the Guise family, Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne, Claude, Duke of Aumale (killed on 21 February), Henry I, Duke of Guise; and other nobles including: Louis IV de Nevers, Guillaume de Thoré, Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Filippo di Piero Strozzi, Albert de Gondi, Blaise de Monluc, Artus de Cossé-Brissac, Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme, Armand de Gontaut. Among these nobles were some who remained suspicious of Royal intentions and deplored the violence of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, and some who were sympathetic to the Protestant cause; political intrigues traversed the royal camp.Jouanna, pp.211–2. Henry, Duke of Anjou in 1570. Painting by Jean de Court Eight assaults on the city were waged from February to June. These attacks, along with cold winter, resulted in large losses on the royal army's side. (Brantôme, who participated in the siege, exaggerated the death toll as 22,000 men; records show that of 155 commanders, 66 were killed and 47 were wounded.)Jouanna, p.211. On 26 March 1573, 150 attackers were killed in an accidental explosion of a mine intended to destroy the ramparts. The Duke of Anjou was himself wounded several times during the siege. On 23 May 1573, 6,000 Swiss guard mercenaries arrived as reinforcements for the royal army, but the attack three days later was a disaster for the royal troops. Gabriel de Lorges comte de Montgomery (1530–1574). The inhabitants of the city sent an ambassador to Queen Elizabeth I of England seeking her assistance, but Elizabeth – still bound by her 1572 treaty with France (the Treaty of Blois) – was only able to send a limited number of ships led by Gabriel, comte de Montgomery. Seven ships arrived in February 1573, but a larger group of ships were forced to turn back by the French navy in April 1573 (retreating to Belle Île and then Jersey). The majority of the city's dwindling resources were supplied through small naval raids on Catholic (principally Spanish) ships (which were also being attacked by the Dutch gueux de mer corsairs). To block La Rochelle's ships' access to the sea, the Duke of Nevers sank a large barge, with no effect.Jouanna, p. 208. (Later, in the siege of 1627-28, Cardinal Richelieu constructed a massive sea barricade to block the city.) Entrance of the Polish delegates (winged Polish hussars depicted) in La Rochelle at the end of the siege in 1573. At the end of May 1573, Henry of Anjou learned that he had been elected King of Poland, a country with a Protestant minority - prompted him to ensue an end of the assault on La Rochelle. An agreement was reached on 24 June 1573 and Catholic troops ended the siege on 6 July 1573. Aftermath The fourth phase of the Wars of Religion was brought to a close by the Edict of Boulogne signed in July 1573. La Rochelle was designated as one of the three cities in France where the Protestant faith was permitted, but only under strict conditions.

It was designed as an \\"all-in-one\\" dictionary for native speakers of Japanese, especially high school and university students. History Shogakukan intended for the Daijisen to directly compete with Iwanami's popular Kōjien desktop dictionary, which was a bestseller through three editions (1955, 1969, 1983). The Daijisen followed upon the success of two other Kōjien competitors, Sanseido's Daijirin (\\"Great forest of words\\", 1988, 1995, 2006) and Kōdansha's color-illustrated Nihongo Daijiten (\\"Great dictionary of Japanese\\", 1989, 1995). All of these dictionaries weigh around one kilogram and have about 3000 pages. The 1st edition Daijisen (1995) included over 220,000 entries and 6000 all-color illustrations and photographs. The chief editor was also chief editor of the directly competing Daijirin dictionary. Other Daijisen editors included Akihiko Ikegami (池上秋彦), Hiroshi Kaneda (金田弘), and Kazuo Sugizaki (杉崎一雄). Shogakukan also released a CD-ROM version (1997) of the 1st edition. The \\"enlarged and revised\\" edition Daijisen (1998) was more of a revision than an enlargement, with 2978 pages versus 2938 in the 1st edition. Both editions claim \\"over 220,000 headwords\\". Characteristics The Daijisen and Daijirin have much more in common than Matsumura's lexicographical supervision and similar (\\"Great fountain/forest of words\\") titles. These two dictionaries share many features of design and content. Both arrange word meanings with the most frequent ones first (like the American Heritage Dictionary), in contrast to the Kōjien tradition of arranging with the oldest recorded meanings first (like the Oxford English Dictionary). Compare their two respective definitions of hyōsetsu (剽窃 \\"plagiarize\\"). *Daijirin: 他人の作品・学説などを自分のものとして発表すること。\\"To take another person's works, theory, etc. and publish it as one's own.\\" *Daijisen: 他人の作品や論文を盗んで、自分のものとして発表すること。\\"To steal another person's works or writing and publish it as one's own.\\" Some similarities between these dictionaries are obvious: Matsumura's 2nd edition Daijirin (1995) added some full-color illustrations, including a chart of 168 color names (色の名) and his Daijisen (1995) included a color chart of 358 (カラーチャート色名). The Daijisen is not wholly derivative of the Daijirin and has some notable differences. Daijisen improvements include visually appealing designs, more contemporary usage examples, and some helpful layout features. For instance, special columns indicate usage notes for topics including synonyms, suffixes, and even uncommon kanji pronunciations (nanori 名のり \\"special readings for names\\" and nandoku 難読 \\"difficult to read\\").

Reviews The Japanese lexicographer Tom Gally (1999) analyzes the Daijisen, > This dictionary seems in many ways a clone of Daijirin. Not only is the same > Tokyo University professor listed as editor – though it is important to note > that the names appearing on the covers of Japanese dictionaries often have > little relation to the people who actually did the work; one case in point > being Koujien, even the most recent editions of which list as editor one 新村出 > Shinmura Izuru, who has been dead since 1967 – but the definitions in > Daijisen follow closely those of Daijirin as well. It also follows > Daijirin's practice of putting the contemporary meanings first in its > definitions. The two chief differences I've noticed are that Daijisen has > color pictures while Daijirin uses line drawings – a rather obvious > difference – and that the example sentences and phrases in Daijisen are more > often typical of the contemporary language rather than citations from > classical literature. This latter point makes Daijisen my first choice when > I am writing Japanese and I want to check how words are used in context. The bibliographer and cataloguer Yasuko Makino (2002) describes the Daijisen, > Over 220,000 words including archaic words, technical terms, geographical > and personal names, and other proper names as well although focus is on > modern words, are in this easy-to-use dictionary. Numerous examples of > usage, explanation of delicate difference in the usage of each words, > abundant inclusion of synonyms, and 6,000 all-color illustrations are a few > of its strengths. One of the unique features of this dictionary is a listing > of last elements, which functions as reverse-order dictionary. Includes > detailed color charts. This works as kokugo jiten [Japanese–Japanese > dictionary], kanwa jiten [Chinese–Japanese kanji dictionary], kogo jiten > [Classical Japanese dictionary], katakanago jiten [katakana loanword > dictionary], and encyclopedia.

A twin-engine, mid-wing monoplane, it was developed for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service but never deployed in combat. The Ki-74 was designed for high altitude operation with a pressurized cabin for its crew. Development Though already conceived in 1939 as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft capable of reaching west of Lake Baikal when operating from bases in Manchukuo (Manchuria), the initial prototype Ki-74 only first flew as late as March 1944, after its development and primary mission requirement had been changed to capability of bombing and reconnaissance over the mainland United States. The aircraft was powered by two Mitsubishi Ha-211-I [Ha-43-I] radial engines. The subsequent two prototypes were powered by the turbo-supercharged Mitsubishi Ha-211-I Ru [Ha-43-II]; these experienced teething troubles and the following thirteen pre-production machines substituted the Ha-211 Ru engine for the lower-powered but more reliable turbo-supercharged Mitsubishi Ha-104 Ru (Army Type 4 1,900 hp Air Cooled Radial). The aircraft was fitted with self-sealing fuel tanks, armor and a pressurized cabin for its crew of 5. Operational history The Ki-74 did not progress beyond developmental testing to see operational service in combat.

Pavel in his 1986 book, Fictional Worlds.Pavel, Thomas G. Fictional Worlds. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1986. The concept refers to the referential relationship of a text to a fictional world, the ontology of which can be established by a possible worlds approach.Doležel, Lubomir. Heterocosmica: Fiction and Possible Worlds. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1998. A large text that refers to a small fictional world is said to have low referential density, whereas a small text referring to a large fictional world has high referential density. The size of the text is measured in abstract terms as amplitude, which in most cases will correspond to its physical length; exceptions to this may arise in cases of embedded discourses, such as metanarratives (or imaging digressions), which refer to the actual world. For this reason, the form and genre of a fictional work provide only an approximate indication of its size; by the same token, it is possible to refer to the size and referential density of part of a fictional work. The size of a fictional world, in turn, is measured in terms of the sum total of properties applicable to the objects and agents inhabiting the fictional world.Ryan, Marie-Laure. Possible Worlds, Artificial Intelligence, and Narrative Theory. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1991. Relative density Relative (referential) density builds upon the abstract definition of referential density by including context sensitive factors such as the degree of external information the reader has to import to his reconstruction of the fictional world, the text's narrative crowding, the ratio between action and description, and the epistemic paths chosen by the text. These factors will usually have more impact on the number of references in a text than its amplitude. Significance Referential density and relative (referential) density account for much of what makes fictional texts 'thick' or 'easy' reads. All other factors being equal, high density will make for difficult reading in that the reader is required to reconstruct the fictional world in a short space, whereas low density is characteristic of a high degree of action. An author may, however, focus on psychology and thereby have a static plot with low density. On the other hand, certain authors and genres make the reader's reconstruction of the fictional world the very point of the text's enjoyment, which is the case with most works of science-fiction, fantasy, and historical fiction.

Along logging roads, it occasionally penetrates forests, and sometimes inhabits clearings within forested areas. It has also been known to live in areas of human habitation.

When Eritrea gained independence, Isaak returned to his native country, married and had children. He began working as a reporter for the country's first independent newspaper, Setit. Eventually, he became a part-owner of the newspaper. Possible replica of the prison cell of Dawit Isaak, exhibited at Mediedagarna i Göteborg (on Svenska Mässan), March 2015\\"Varmt tack till er som var med under Meg!\\". freedawit.com. Retrieved 7 June 2015.  Imprisonment  On 23 September 2001, Isaak was arrested in his home in Asmara, Eritrea. At the same time, ten other independent journalists and eleven prominent reformist politicians of the so-called G-15 were arrested, ostensibly for demanding democratic reforms in a series of letters to President Isayas Afeworki. The independent press, including the Setit newspaper, had covered the confrontation between the president and the reformers. In April 2002, CPJ, the Committee to Protect Journalists, reported that Isaak was hospitalized due to torture. The Eritrean government denied that he has been tortured, but did not allow anyone to visit him. Isaak had not been tried before a court. Because he held dual Swedish and Eritrean citizenship, Swedish authorities began working for his release, using \\"silent diplomacy\\" according to government sources. On 19 November 2005, Isaak was released from jail, and according to official Eritrean sources, he was released only to see a doctor. After only two days of freedom, and while on his way to the hospital, Isaak was imprisoned again. He is believed to be held in Carchele prison in central Asmara. Every week, a number of organizations, including Reporters Without Borders and the National Press Club, petition the Eritrean Embassy in Stockholm to free Isaak. On 27 March 2009, four of the five largest newspapers in Sweden, Aftonbladet, Expressen, Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet, featured a plea for the release of Isaak on their front pages. In addition, the five newspapers will feature joint reports on Isaak's situation, and a joint petition was handed over to the Eritrean Embassy in Stockholm on 4 May. By 4 May, 209,963 people had signed the petition. On 26 May 2009, during an interview with the Swedish TV4 (channel 4) the president of Eritrea dismissed the case altogether with the words \\"We will not have any trial and we will not free him. We know how to handle his kind.\\" and \\"To me, Sweden is irrelevant. The Swedish government has nothing to do with us.\\" The \\"silent diplomacy\\" method that the Swedish authorities have employed to work for Isaak's release has been criticized by the Swedish media, and the president of the Swedish branch of Reporters Without Borders, Jesper Bengtsson, issued a statement in April 2010, saying that \\"[i]t is a disgrace that Dawit remains in prison and it is remarkable that the Swedish government does not try harder to get him released.\\" After the release of the Albanian-American pilot James Berisha, the 1st Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo, Behgjet Pacolli, will start a new mission in Eritrea for the release of Isaak.Mision i ri i Pacollit në Eritre, KosovaTimes (in Albanian) 2012-02-2012  Rumors about death  On several occasions, rumors have circulated that Isaak is no longer alive, the most recent of which was on 27 October 2011, his 47th birthday, when Swedish commercial radio channel \\"Radio 1\\" claimed that Dawit Isaak could well be dead. In April 2012, rumours of his death once again began circulating when several Eritrean politicians stated that he had died in prison. When a government official from Eritrea was confronted about the rumours during an interview in Sweden, he avoided the question and refused to answer.  Awards  * On 2 March 2007, Isaak was awarded a newly established prize, dedicated to the memory of Anna Politkovskaya and awarded by the Swedish National Press Club. * In 2009 Isaak was awarded the Kurt-Tucholsky-Prize by the Swedish P.E.N.-Association. * He was awarded the Norwegian \\"Ytringsfrihetsprisen\\", the Freedom of Expression Prize for 2009, at the annual meeting of the Norwegian Authors' Union on 14 March 2010. * In October 2011 Isaak received the Golden Pen of Freedom Award of the World Association of Newspapers. The award was handed over in Vienna to his brother Esias Isaak. * In March 2017 he received the 2017 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize.

In other media=Television * Mayor Hamilton Hill appears in Batman: The Animated Series voiced by Lloyd Bochner. While originally hostile to the Batman and somewhat comical at times, this version of Hill showed absolutely no trace of the corruption present in the comics. He first appeared in the episode \\"On Leather Wings\\", where he allows Detective Harvey Bullock to pursue Batman (along with his own special task force) when the vigilante is framed for robbing several pharmacies throughout Gotham City. In the episode \\"Pretty Poison\\", Mayor Hill is a supporter of DA Harvey Dent's push to establish Stonegate Penitentiary. In the episode \\"Be a Clown\\", his son Jordan is kidnapped by Joker after he runs away because he thinks his dad doesn't care about him. As seen in \\"The Clock King\\", businessman Temple Fugate has a grudge against Hill because he believed that he made him late for a court date on purpose (Fugate was appealing a $20 million judgement against his company, and subsequently lost). Hill had been a lawyer at the time, which convinced Fugate that Hill had deceived him because the lawyers who had worked on the case belonged to Hill's law firm. Taking on the mantle of Clock King, Temple tried to dispose of Mayor Hill at a clock tower only for Batman to intervene and save him. In the episode \\"Heart of Steel\\" Pt. 2, Mayor Hill was almost replaced with an android duplicate made by HARDAC, although Batman rescued him again.

He was blackmailed by Poison Ivy along with other politicians and wealthy socialites with a lethal parasite that will consume his internal organs unless he buys \\"food\\" from Ivy. Batman defeats her and manages to devise a cure to save the Mayor's life. * In Batman: Arkham Origins, the name \\"Hamilton Hill\\" can be seen on a sign. During the credits for the story-based campaign expansion \\"A Cold, Cold Heart\\", a report can be heard saying that Hill, the current mayor, was resigning following protests caused by the events of the game which saw his police commissioner, Gillian B. Loeb, exposed as a corrupt officer working for mob boss Black Mask. Mayor Hamilton Hill as seen in Batman: The Telltale Series. * Mayor Hamilton Hill appears in Batman: The Telltale Series, voiced by Robert Pescovitz. This version of the character has a personal relationship with mobster Carmine Falcone and is currently campaigning to keep his position against crusading district attorney Harvey Dent, whom Bruce Wayne is supporting. After information about Bruce's father Thomas being an old friend of Falcone's is released to the press, Hill authorizes a police search of Wayne Manor in an attempt to intimidate Bruce into dropping his support for Dent's campaign. When Batman confronts Falcone, he learns that both he and Hill had a secret alliance with his parents. After he is revealed to have been working with Penguin and the Children of Arkham to protect himself from their wrath, Hill is confronted by either Bruce Wayne or Batman, with Hill revealing information about the trio's use of Arkham Asylum to gain control of Gotham. During an attack by the Children of Arkham, Hill is murdered by Penguin after the latter discovers that he was partially responsible for committing his late mother to Arkham. Before he dies, Hill reveals that he hired Joe Chill to kill the Waynes. Following his death, Dent is sworn in as Mayor.

It is on the Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line, between Dostoyevskaya and Sretensky Bulvar stations. Trubnaya opened on 30 August 2007 as a part of the long-awaited line extension northwesternwards. It was a northwestern terminus of the line until June 2010. Name It is named after . Transfer It offers a transfer to the station on the Serpukhovsko- Timiryazevskaya Line. Transfer to Tsvetoy Boulevard station is achieved in a two part process that involves an ascent into an interim hall and then a walk to the older station.  History  Construction of the station began as far back as 1984, during the building of Tsvetnoy Bulvar station which set provisions for the future station, and during the late 1980s was fully underway with plans to open by the late 1990s. However the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 put a long delay to construction which at time stood frozen, and, despite a few slow restarts, remained derelict. Only in 2005 when proper funding finally came did the works resume. The station was opened just in two years, on 30 August 2007.  Design  Architecturally the station is a tri-vault wall column design with a monolithic concrete plate on the floor. The theme, work of architects V. Fillipov, S. Petrosyan, A. Ruban, T. Silakadze, T. Petrova and S. Prytkova, is based on Moscow and old Russian cities. The portals, cornices and station walls are faced with warm beige marble. Contrasting with that is the dark green marble used for columns, and for panels between the portals as well as for panels on the station walls. The floor features a geometric layout which repeats the portals out of polished dark green, black and light grey granite. Lighting is achieved by hidden fluorescent lamps behind the portal cornices which unite every four passages between the central and the platform halls. The vaults of the central (9.5 metre diameter) and the platform halls are covered with white fibreglass to offer extra hydroisolation. Decoration of the station is centered on the 12 wall columns. Each of these feature a wooden bench surrounded by a black ironwork frame that supports four spherical lamps on the top, giving the impression of a traditional Moscow boulevard. However the central feature of this is an illuminated stained glass mosaic with an image of a historic Russian city (such as Rostov, Novgorod, Yaroslavl and others), all work of Zurab Tsereteli. The author is also responsible for two large mosaics which decorate the portals of the escalator tunnels upon leaving the station. The vestibule of the station is located under the intersection of the Tsvetnoy Boulevard and the Boulevard Ring and the Trubnaya Square for which the station is named.

Crystal structure of HIV-1 Tat complexed with human P-TEFb. Nature 2010; 465:747-51. The structure of HIV Tat bound to P-TEFb demonstrated that the viral protein forms extensive contacts with the cyclin T1 subunit (Figure 2).  Regulation of P-TEFb  Figure 3. Reversible association of P-TEFb with the 7SK snRNP. P-TEFb is released from the 7SK snRNP by Brd4 or HIV Tat. HEXIM is ejected and the two proteins are replaced by hrRNPs. The reverse of this process requires other unknown factors. Because of its central role in controlling eukaryotic gene expression, P-TEFb is subject to stringent regulation at the level of transcription of the genes encoding the subunits, translation of the subunit mRNAs, turnover of the subunits, and also by an unusual mechanism involving the 7SK snRNP. As shown in Figure 3 P-TEFb is held in the 7SK snRNP by the double stranded RNA binding protein HEXIM (HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 in humans). HEXIM bound to 7SK RNA or any double stranded RNA binds to P-TEFb and inhibits the kinase activity.Li Q, Cooper JJ, Altwerger GH, Feldkamp MD, Shea MA, Price DH. HEXIM1 is a promiscuous double-stranded RNA-binding protein and interacts with RNAs in addition to 7SK in cultured cells.

LARP7 is a stable component of the 7SK snRNP while P-TEFb, HEXIM1 and hnRNP A1 are reversibly associated.

A La-related protein modulates 7SK snRNP integrity to suppress P-TEFb-dependent transcriptional elongation and tumorigenesis. Mol Cell 2008; 29:588-99. When P-TEFb is extracted from the 7SK snRNP, 7SK RNA undergoes a conformation change, HEXIM is ejected and hnRNPs take the place of the factors removed. The re- sequestration of P-TEFb requires another rearrangement of the RNA, binding of HEXIM and then P-TEFb. In rapidly growing cells the 7SK snRNP is the predominate form of P-TEFb. For review.

Le Guin which was first published in the science fiction anthology Millennial Women. Plot introduction The Eye of the Heron is a science fiction novel set on the fictional planet of Victoria in a speculative future, probably sometime in the 22nd century, when the planet has been colonized for about a century and has no communication with Earth. The protagonist is a young woman called Luz but the story is told in the third person and the reader sees events from the point of view of several different characters. The Eye of the Heron is usually treated as one of Le Guin's minor novels although it exhibits her characteristic prose style and themes. Title The title is a reference to a fictional animal on the planet Victoria which early colonists called heron because of some superficial similarities to Earth heron. The characters' encounters with these animals occur at moments of significant introspection, particularly when they are considering that which they perceive as alien, or other, in relation to themselves. Plot summary The planet of Victoria received two waves of colonists from Earth: first two prison ships founding a penal colony and then one ship of political exiles. The descendants of the prisoners mostly inhabit the City. The descendants of the political exiles, the \\"People of Peace\\", inhabit Shantih Town, which is known to the City dwellers as Shanty Town. The Shantih Towners, whose primary occupation is farming, want to settle another valley further away from the City. The City \\"Bosses\\" do not want to lose the control they believe they have over the Shanty Towners and so they take action to try to prevent any settlement beyond their sphere of influence. Characters=City characters * Luz Marina Falco Cooper * Luis Burnier Falco (Luz's father and a Boss) * Herman Macmilan * Captain Eden Shantih Town characters * Vera Adelson * Lev Shults * Southwind * Andre * Hari * Elia Major themes The major themes in The Eye of the Heron are common to much of Le Guin's fiction and include the social constructions of gender, interactions between individuals from different societies, intra-actions within societies, and contact with that which is perceived as alien or other. The novel also explores different forms of social and political organization by juxtaposing pacifist anarchism with violent oligarchy. The characters' metaphorical internal journeys are reflected in literal external journeys throughout the plot. When asked, in a 1995 interview, what role the feminist movement had played in her writing, Le Guin situated The Eye of the Heron in the context of her development as a writer: Allusions in other works The Eye of the Heron contains the phrase \\"beginning place\\". Le Guin incorporated it into the title of her 1980 novel The Beginning Place. Awards and nominations * 1979, Locus Award, Best SF Novel category, 21st place.

The organization takes advantage of both federal and state funding of around $1 billion annually. Since its founding, the organization has dredged over 60 miles of sediment into islands and artificial land, as well as 36,000 acres of marshland. CPRA predicts that over the next 50 years, over 1,450 square miles of land in Louisiana could be lost along coastal areas.  History  The creation of CPRA was ordered by Congress in .http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/109-148_2005_hurricanes.pdf The CPRA's forerunner, the Wetlands Conservation and Restoration Authority, was restructured as the CPRA by Act 8 of the First Extraordinary Session of 2005https://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=329530 when the tasks of coastal restoration and hurricane protection were consolidated under a single authority. The authority is responsible for overseeing all levee districts in the Louisiana Coastal Zone and dispersal of funding from Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Trust Fund to be used exclusively for wetland restoration and hurricane protection projects. Act 8 defines the CPRA's mandate as, \\"hurricane protection and the protection, conservation, restoration, and enhancement of coastal wetlands and barrier shorelines or reefs.\\" Additionally, the act defined the term \\"coastal area\\" as the Louisiana Coastal Zone and contiguous areas that are subject to storm or tidal surge. In April 2007, the CPRA submitted Louisiana's first ever Comprehensive Master Plan for coastal restoration and hurricane protection to the state's legislature for approval. The legislature approved the plan unanimously. Entitled: \\"Integrated Ecosystem Restoration and Hurricane Protection: Louisiana's Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast,\\" the Master Plan represents an overarching vision that fully incorporates hurricane protection projects and structures with coastal wetland and hydrology restoration projects. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials will use the CPRA Master Plan as the cornerstone of the Congressionally mandated Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LaCPR) Report scheduled to be written and submitted to Congress by December 2007. In 2012, an article in The New York Times reviewed the current state of improvements to New Orleans defenses. August 24, 2015, an article in The Huffington Post titled \\"10 Years After Katrina, Louisiana Is Becoming A Model For Climate Resilience\\" summarized the current state of Louisiana's shoreline and coastal community protection.  Plan for a Sustainable Coast  Every five years CPRA must submit a revised plan to the state legislature. The current plan is the 2012 Master Plan, a 190-page document. The agency is currently working on the 2017 plan. Projects detailed in the plan fall into the following categories: * Structural Protection * Bank Stabilization * Oyster Barrier Reefs * Ridge Restoration * Shoreline Protection * Infrastructure * Terraces * Barrier Island Restoration * Marsh Creation * Sediment Diversion * Hydrologic Restoration Projects There are many projects listed on both the CPRA and CWPPRA websites, and both sites have interactive maps to readily display projects.

The twenty-first tropical cyclone, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the 1981 Atlantic hurricane season, Katrina developed from an area of cloudiness in the western Caribbean Sea early on November 3\\\\. The initial tropical depression deepened slowly, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Katrina on November 5\\\\. About six hours later, Katrina peaked with sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). The storm made landfall along the south coast of Camagüey Province in Cuba early on November 6\\\\. Katrina quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean hours later. The system then accelerated northeastward and crossed the Bahamas late on November 6\\\\. Katrina dissipated late on November 7, shortly before merging with a frontal system. On Grand Cayman, a waterspout ripped out a grape tree and slammed it into the Brac Reef Hotel's bar. Heavy rainfall was observed on Cuba, peaking at . As a result, Cuba experienced flash flooding in mountainous areas as Katrina moved across the country. In southern Camagüey Province, several bridges and railroads were reportedly washed out. Two sugar mills suffered damage. An estimated 4,641 homes suffered impact, 39 of which were destroyed. In addition, approximately 80% of sugar cane crops were damaged. Two people drowned in Cuba while attempting to cross a swollen river in Camagüey Province. The Bahamas received up to 14 in (360 mm) of rain, causing flood damage to watermelon, tomato and corn crops, particularly on Long Island. Meteorological history On November 1, an area of disturbed weather – a mass of cloudiness and thunderstorms – developed over the western Caribbean Sea. Subsequently, a low pressure area began to form. The system was designated a tropical depression early on November 3, while located about to the south of the Cayman Islands. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories on the tropical depression at on November 3\\\\. In the initial advisory, it was noted that the depression would slowly strengthen, but reach tropical storm status within 24 hours due to \\"strong\\" convection. The depression remained disorganized through early on November 4, with satellite imagery and weather stations in the Caribbean Sea region indicating no intensification. However, only a few hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Katrina, while drifting northward. Continuing to strengthen, Katrina slowly recurved north-northeastward and eventually to the northeast. The National Hurricane Center operationally classified Katrina as a tropical depression until on November 4, after a reconnaissance aircraft flight reported tropical storm force winds. At on November 5, the storm strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later that same day, Katrina attained its peak intensity after another reconnaissance aircraft flight reported a minimum barometric pressure of , and observed maximum sustained winds of about 85 mph (140 km/h) on the surface. However, Katrina weakened slightly while approaching Cuba. Early on November 6, the storm made landfall in Camagüey Province with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Shortly after moving inland, the system weakened to a tropical storm. A deepening trough offshore the East Coast of the United States caused Katrina to accelerate east-northeastward. By on November 6, the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. Katrina slowly weakened while crossing through the central Bahamas later that day. After a reconnaissance aircraft flight failed to locate a closed circulation, the system dissipated late on November 7, while located about south-southeast of Bermuda. Preparations and impact alt=An infrared radar image of Hurricane Katrina. A note on the center-left labels the name of the storm In anticipation of Katrina, 150,000 people and 120,000 head of cattle in central Cuba were evacuated, according to a broadcast by Havana radio. As a result, Cuban Civil Defense officers issued a storm alert for five provinces. A hurricane watch was declared for the central and eastern Bahamas. Along the southeast coast of Florida, small craft were advised to remain close to port. However, the storm was not expected to, and did not, pose a threat to the United States. Throughout the Cayman Islands, Katrina dropped up to of precipitation. In Grand Cayman, a waterspout ripped out a grape tree and slammed it into the Brac Reef Hotel's Bar. The highest observed 24-hour precipitation total in Cuba was , while rainfall in the nation peaked at . As a result, Cuba experienced flash flooding in mountainous areas as Katrina moved across the country. In southern Camagüey Province, a number of bridges and railroads were washed out. Two sugar mills suffered damage. About 4,641 homes suffered impact, 39 of which were destroyed. In addition, an estimated 80% of sugar cane crops were damaged. Two people drowned in Cuba while attempting to cross a swollen river in Camagüey Province. The Bahamas received up to 14 in (360 mm) of rain. Although no deaths or injuries were reported there, heavy rains in the central islands caused flood damage to watermelon, tomato and corn crops on Long Island.

Both masts, built in 1972, were not only the tallest towers in the Western hemisphere at the time used for military purposes, they are also the tallest towers used for long wave transmissions in the Western hemisphere and since the collapse of Warsaw Radio Mast perhaps the tallest structures electrically insulated against ground. Both masts are umbrella antennas. They are fed by an overhead cable, fixed to the mast at one end, and to a small mast near the helix building at the opposite end. As the small mast is grounded, the feeder is attached to it with an insulator in the span field.

Punjabi dramas are characterized by taunts which are almost entirely of an adult nature, although this is at many times done through word play which implies something else. Later on actors of Faisalabad became famous in the scene and choreographed dances on Punjabi film songs were also introduced which increased the popularity of these stage shows considerably. Sometimes the plays also carry a moral.  Audience and popularity  Punjabi dramas are popular with the lower and middle class and were made famous through distribution on CD's in the mid and late 1990s. Recently, due availability of these dramas on YouTube, they have also become increasingly popular in Punjab region of India. Genre of comedy Punjabi dramas are semi-improvisational. Mostly actors keep going on for several minutes, taunting each other. Women in the stage shows are shown normally of ill repute and this is made very clear through the taunts they get from male actors. Famous people such as Cricket players, Pakistani and Indian film stars and even celebrities from Western culture such as Jackie Chan, Michael Jackson, Colonel Sanders of KFC are used in humor.

At the beginning of the First World War, he was the head of the Third Army which he led during the Battles of the Frontiers, Charleroi, and the Marne. He was relieved of his command because of illness in September 1914. Early life Coming from a military family Hausen entered the Saxon army as a cadet in the royal Saxon school of cadets. Being promoted to Seconde-Lieutenant in 1864 he joined the 3rd Jäger Battalion and served against Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866; where he saw action at the Battle of Königgrätz.

Two low-flying Russian attack aircraft carried out repeated rocket attacks on a large convoy of refugees trying to enter the Russian republic of Ingushetia using a supposed \\"safe exit\\" route, killing or injuring scores of people.  The attack  The incident took place after it was officially announced that the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia would re-open following a week's closure. However, the convoy of more than 1,000 vehicles heading to safety was not permitted to cross the border and ordered to turn back by an unidentified senior Russian military officer (the area was under responsibility of Gen. Vladimir Shamanov), and subsequently attacked on their way back to the besieged Chechen capital Grozny. According to the Amnesty International report, \\"at the time of the Russian attacks there were no legitimate military targets in the area. Eyewitness accounts of this incident would seem to indicate that the Russian forces had deliberately targeted civilians and civilian objects, despite some of them being marked with the Red Cross emblem, in violation of international humanitarian law.\\"Russian Federation (Chechnya): For the motherland: Reported grave breaches of international humanitarian law. Attack on a civilian convoy near Shami-Yurt (29 October) , Amnesty International, 1 December 1999 The victims included local International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement workers, two killed Chechen journalists (including Ramzan Mezhidov), and numerous women and children, some of them reportedly burned alive while trapped in their vehicles. Russian authorities have at first officially denied responsibility,Russia denies deadly attack on refugee convoy, The Independent, Nov 1, 1999 and the later military investigations were not meaningful.  Similar incidents  A similar aerial attack on a large column of refugees fleeing Grozny fighting took place in August 1996.Truce That Never Was: Chechens Tricked, The New York Times, August 15, 1996 A number of other attacks on \\"humanitarian corridor\\" refugee convoys and foot columns were also reported later in 1999-2000, including a December 3 incident in which about 40 people were shot to death at a Russian police checkpoint.

Also known as Swan Pond, the house was constructed in 1797 by English architect Thomas Hope for Colonel Francis Alexander Ramsey (1764-1820), whose family operated a plantation at the site until the U.S. Civil War.Lisa Oakley, Ramsey House. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 11 February 2013. In 1969, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its architecture and its role in the region's early 19th- century history. Francis Alexander Ramsey arrived in what is now Greene County in 1783, and shortly thereafter made a surveying trip down the Holston River, where he first identified the future site of the Ramsey House. Throughout the 1780s, he served as an official of the fledgling State of Franklin, and later served in various capacities in the governments of the Southwest Territory and the State of Tennessee.Elizabeth Bowman Scaggs, \\"Swan Pond: Francis Alexander Ramsey's Stone House, a Tennessee State Shrine.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 27 (1955), pp. 9-18. Ramsey's children included early Knoxville mayor, W. B. A. Ramsey, and early Tennessee historian and businessman, J. G. M. Ramsey, both of whom occupied the Ramsey House at various times. Due to their Confederate sympathies, the Ramseys fled Knoxville when the Union Army occupied the city during the Civil War,Lisa Oakley, James Gettys McGready Ramsey. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 11 February 2013. and the family sold the house in 1866. The Knoxville Chapter of the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities (APTA) purchased the Ramsey House in 1952, and currently maintains the house and grounds as a museum. Location The Ramsey House is situated in a broad valley just over a mile east of Forks-of-the-River, where the Holston River and French Broad River join to form the Tennessee River. The property managed by APTA, which includes the Ramsey House, a visitor's center, and gardens, covers . The house and grounds are located at 2614 Thorngrove Pike, just off John Sevier Highway (TN-168). History=Early history and development The Ramsey House, photographed by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1934 Francis Alexander Ramsey was born in Pennsylvania in 1764 to Scotch-Irish parents, and moved to Greene County, Tennessee in 1783. That year, North Carolina (which controlled what is now East Tennessee) opened up Cherokee lands north of the French Broad to settlement, and Ramsey, James White, and several other explorers began making excursions into what is now the Knoxville area in search of new land. On one such expedition, Ramsey discovered a game-rich beaver dam pond which he named \\"Swan Pond.\\" He was issued a grant for Swan Pond and its surrounding land in November 1786. Ramsey's rise to prominence in the failed State of Franklin (1784-1788) kept him occupied for the remainder of the decade, and it wasn't until 1792-- after he had been appointed clerk for the newly formed Southwest Territory-- that he decided to move to Swan Pond, which lay just outside the territory's new capital at Knoxville. Ramsey chose to build his new house on a peninsula in the pond, although due to malaria concerns, he was forced to drain the pond before the house was constructed. London-trained architect Thomas Hope designed the house, and probably built it between 1795 and 1797. In the years after its completion, the Ramsey House came to be part of a sizeable plantation. Upon Ramsey's death in 1820, the house passed to his eldest son, W.B.A. Ramsey. In 1840, W.B.A Ramsey sold the house to his brother, J.G.M. Ramsey (1797-1884), who had taken an active interest in the region's history, and had built a large mansion nearby to the east, known as \\"Mecklenburg,\\" overlooking the fork of both the French Broad River with the Holston River and the no longer extant Lebanon In The Fork Presbyterian Church, along the nearby and present-day Asbury Road. Mecklenburg was noted for its 4,000-volume library containing numerous 18th-century documents pertaining to the settlement of Tennessee.J.G.M. Ramsey, Willam Hesseltine (ed.), Autobiography and Letters (Nashville, Tenn.: Tennessee Historical Commission, 1954), preface. In 1857, J.G.M. Ramsey gave the Ramsey House to his son, also named Francis Alexander Ramsey, as a wedding present. The Civil War Parson Brownlow's depiction of his rival, John Crozier Ramsey, being drummed out of the Confederate Army J.G.M. Ramsey played an active role in the economic development of East Tennessee. He helped establish the region's first medical society, served as president of the Bank of East Tennessee, and fought to bring railroads to the region. In the late 1850s, as one of the directors of the Bank of East Tennessee, Ramsey ran afoul of Knoxville's fiery newspaper publisher, William G. \\"Parson\\" Brownlow. Brownlow relentlessly accused the bank's directors, who along with Ramsey included Ramsey's brothers-in-law, John H. Crozier and A.R. Crozier, of defrauding the bank's clients. He also accused Ramsey's son, John Crozier Ramsey (1824-1868), whom Brownlow called \\"a few degrees removed from an idiot,\\"William Gannaway Brownlow, Sketches of the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Secession (Philadelphia: G.W. Childs, 1862), pp. 289-290. of creating false pension funds for employees. His continued attacks helped Horace Maynard defeat John Crozier Ramsey for the district's Congressional seat in 1859.Robert McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 49. At the outbreak of the Civil War, the Ramseys, who were states' rights Democrats, sided with the Confederacy, drawing them further into conflict with Brownlow, who was a radical anti-secessionist. In December 1861, John Crozier Ramsey, who had been appointed Knox County's district attorney, had Brownlow jailed on charges of conspiring to burn railroad bridges in East Tennessee. The Ramseys demanded Brownlow be hanged, but the Confederate Army, fearing a public backlash, released him. Due in part to Brownlow's influence, J.G.M. Ramsey's Mecklenburg mansion-- with its invaluable library-- was burned when the Union Army occupied Knoxville in 1863. With Mecklenburg in ruins, the Ramseys, who had fled to South Carolina on approach of the Union Army in 1863, decided not to return to Knoxville. The Ramsey House was sold to William Spurgien in 1866, and afterward began to deteriorate. J.G.M. Ramsey eventually moved back to Knoxville in the 1870s, and was deeply saddened at the state of the Ramsey House. His autobiography, written during this period, included a poem lamenting the house's decline.Ramsey, Autobiography, pp. 9-11. Preservation In 1927, the Bonnie Kate Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a marker at the Ramsey House commemorating the site as the birthplace of J.G.M. Ramsey, whose book, the Annals of Tennessee, had become an important work on the state's early history. In the following decade, the house was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey. In 1952, APTA's Knoxville Chapter purchased the house with the help of state and local governments, and began restoring it. The roof and windows were replaced, and an old log cabin was moved to the site to represent the cabin used by the Ramseys in the 1790s while the main house was being built. Design Floor plan of the Ramsey House The Ramsey House is a two-story Late Georgian house, built primarily of local pink marble with blueish-gray limestone trim. This blueish-gray limestone forms a \\"belt\\" around the house about midway up the walls, and also forms the house's four corners. The house has a \\"dogtrot\\" kitchen wing, with the southwest corner of the kitchen wing joining the northeast corner of the main house. Exterior ornamentation includes hand- carved cornices and window arches consisting of nine narrow stones each. The house's interior follows a central hall floor plan. The front door opens into a hallway, with a library/parlor room to the left and a dining room to the right. The second floor has two bedrooms, and a passageway that leads to the second-story entrance door (the purpose of this door is uncertain). The kitchen wing is also two stories, although there is no passage from the second story of the main wing to the second story of the kitchen wing. The house has three chimneys-- one at both ends of the main wing, and one the end of the kitchen wing-- and six fireplaces in all. The interior has been outfitted with period furniture, most notably two Chippendale chairs given to Francis Alexander Ramsey and his wife, Peggy, as a wedding present.

The goal of police psychology is to ensure law enforcement is able to perform their jobs safely, effectively, ethically, and lawfully. Police psychologists Police and public safety psychologists have specialty knowledge about the nature of police work. This specialized knowledge consists of police working environments, the goals of the agencies, stressors and trauma that public safety personal experience, their responses to these stressors, and the interventions used to treat symptoms of PTSD. Additionally, police psychologists are aware of confidentiality and testimonial privilege when serving this community. These psychologists then apply the science and profession of psychology in four primary domains of practice: assessment (primarily preemployment assessments of prospective candidates and fitness-for-duty evaluations of incumbent personnel), clinical intervention, operational support, and organizational consultation. Police and public safety psychology intervention strategies primarily include short-term cognitive behavioral treatments and approaches. Training also includes review of research regarding the relative efficacy as well as the limitations of post-crisis interventions unique to law enforcement personnel (e.g., post-shooting incidents, line-of-duty deaths, deep undercover stress reactions). In addition, various modalities of treatment and programs are typically integrated within the training (e.g. peer support teams, EMDR, suicide intervention training, wellness coaching). Preparation for practice in operational psychology includes review of research in: crisis intervention, hostage negotiation, criminal profiling, psychological autopsy, and epidemiological factors affecting outcomes of various tactical situations. Organizations There are several police and law enforcement agencies in the world today that employ police and public safety psychologists and these are: * The Los Angeles Police Department - At the Behavioral Science Services * The Federal Bureau of Investigation - At the Behavioral Analysis Unit * U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations - A military investigative agency * The National Police Improvement Agency (UK) - Behavioural Investigative Advisors (BIA) * The Hong Kong Police - Hong Kong Police Force - Psychological Services Group * The Japanese Police - Japanese Nation Policy Agency - National Research Institute of Police Science at the Criminology and Behavioral Sciences Section * Singapore Police Force - Police Psychological Services Division (PPSD), Police Headquarters.http://www.spf.gov.sg/prints/annual/2008/08spfa_features_people.htm * Behavioural Sciences Unit, Singapore, at the Home Team Academy. * Western Australia Police Academy - Occupational Psychology Unit.

This field was started in 1990 by Professor David Canter whilst at the University of Surrey, in the South of England (Canter and Youngs, (2009). It brings together issues relating to investigative information, the drawing of inferences and the ways in which law enforcement decision-making can be supported through scientific research. Investigative psychology grew directly out of empirical research. This field covers the full range of investigation related activities such as: * detection of deception, * investigative interviewing, * statement analyses, * behavioral analyses of crimes. This sphere has been much abused worldwide with the spread of the use of originally Eastern methods, including gradual copying of the type of methods once associated to some areas of Asia, what characterizes the latter is the contacting of the suspect via mental means, \\"thinking to\\" techniques known already in Eastern Europe followed by repetition of the alleged offence continually mentally to make it start repeating itself in the mind and even begin to affect speech. Thus these type of investigations and any based on them, being most legally conducted in their areas of origin, are highly dubious.

Almost all Noetherian rings that occur naturally in algebraic geometry or number theory are G-rings, and it is quite hard to construct examples of Noetherian rings that are not G-rings. The concept is named after Alexander Grothendieck. A ring that is a both G-ring and a J-2 ring is called a quasi-excellent ring, and if in addition it is universally catenary it is called an excellent ring. Definitions *A (Noetherian) ring R containing a field k is called geometrically regular over k if for any finite extension K of k the ring R ⊗k K is a regular ring. *A homomorphism of rings from R to S is called regular if it is flat and for every p ∈ Spec(R) the fiber S ⊗R k(p) is geometrically regular over the residue field k(p) of p. (see also Popescu's theorem.) *A ring is called a local G-ring if it is a Noetherian local ring and the map to its completion (with respect to its maximal ideal) is regular. *A ring is called a G-ring if it is Noetherian and all its localizations at prime ideals are local G-rings. (It is enough to check this just for the maximal ideals, so in particular local G-rings are G-rings.) Examples *Every field is a G-ring *Every complete Noetherian local ring is a G-ring *Every ring of convergent power series in a finite number of variables over R or C is a G-ring. *Every Dedekind domain in characteristic 0, and in particular the ring of integers, is a G-ring, but in positive characteristic there are Dedekind domains (and even discrete valuation rings) that are not G-rings. *Every localization of a G-ring is a G-ring *Every finitely generated algebra over a G-ring is a G-ring. This is a theorem due to Grothendieck. Here is an example of a discrete valuation ring A of characteristic p>0 which is not a G-ring. If k is any field of characteristic p with [k:kp] = ∞ and R=kx and A is the subring of power series Σaixi such that [kp(a0,a1,...):kp ] is finite then the formal fiber of A over the generic point is not geometrically regular so A is not a G-ring.

Charter is based on Pierre-Simon Fournier’s characters, originating from the 18th century. Classified by Bitstream as a transitional- serif typeface (Bitstream Transitional 801), it also has features of a slab- serif typeface and is often classified as such. Charter was originally optimized for printing on the low-resolution 300 dpi laser printers of the 1980s, and remains suitable for printing on both modern high-resolution laser printers and inexpensive lower resolution inkjet printers due to its strong, legible design. Its structure was optimised for low-memory computers and printers. In a 2013 interview, Carter explained that it used \\"a very simplified structure and a minimum number of curves, more straight-line segments... very economical compared to, say, Times New Roman,\\" but noted that rapid development of printers made this unnecessary even before he had finished the design. In its simplification of serif forms, it foreshadowed Carter's later landmark design, Georgia for Microsoft. In 1992 Bitstream donated a version of Charter, along with its version of Courier, to the X Consortium under terms that allowed the font to be modified and redistributed. This has resulted in open source derivatives of Bitstream Charter, including Charis SIL. Somehttps://practicaltypography.com/charter.html consider Bitstream Charter to be one of the best free fonts available. Because of its popularity, a new Charter Pro release of the typeface was released in 2004, with an expanded character set including additional symbols, ranging figures (old-style) and small capitals. This version was later added as a system font on OS X. Carter was later asked by Monotype to consider releasing a sans-serif companion to Charter. Finding his attempts unsatisfying, he scrapped the idea for a more radical, less directly complementary design, Carter Sans. History Charter is based on the characters of Pierre-Simon Fournier, a French 18th century punch-cutter, typefounder and typographic theoretician who invented the “point system”, standardized measurement system for font sizes.

The signatories to the convention, – 39 member states and the European Union (EU) as of March 2020\\"List of Ph. Eur. Members & Observers\\" – are committed to the harmonisation of quality standards for safe medicines throughout the European continent and beyond. In addition to the member states there are currently 30 observers, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA). The EDQM’s quality standards for medicines are published in the European Pharmacopoeia (officially abbreviated to Ph. Eur.), which is recognised as a scientific benchmark worldwide and is legally binding in member states. The EU pharmaceutical legislation refers directly to the Ph. Eur. and to other activities for which the EDQM is responsible (e.g. the Certification procedure or “CEP\\" and the OMCL Network\\"OMCL Network\\" – see below), demonstrating the shared commitment of the European organisations to public health protection. The EDQM is also involved in a number of international collaboration and harmonisation initiatives, such as the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group (PDG),Discussion Group (PDG)\\" the International Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme (IPRP),Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme (IPRP)\\" the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH),Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)\\" the International Meeting of World Pharmacopoeias (IMWP),Meeting of World Pharmacopoeias (IMWP)\\" the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S)Inspection Convention and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S)\\" and the International API Inspection ProgrammeAPI Inspection Programme\\" (co-ordinated by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA). In addition, the EDQM works closely with WHO on the establishment, monitoring and distribution of WHO International Standards for Antibiotics (ISA)Standards for Antibiotics (ISA)\\" and WHO International Chemical Reference Substances (ICRS)International Chemical Reference Substances (ICRS)\\" which are necessary to apply the tests described in the WHO’s International Pharmacopoeia.International Pharmacopoeia\\" The EDQM therefore plays an essential role in the complex regulatory framework for medicines in Europe. Its primary purpose is to protect public health by enabling the development, supporting the implementation and monitoring the application of quality standards for safe medicines and their safe use.  The EDQM’s mission  Within the Council of Europe, the EDQM’s mission is to contribute to the basic human right of access to good quality medicines and healthcare, and to promote and protect human and animal health by: * establishing and providing official standards for the manufacture and quality control of medicines in all the signatory states of the Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia, and beyond; * granting Certificates of suitability to manufacturers whose pharmaceutical substances comply with Ph. Eur. standards, and carrying out inspections of the manufacturing sites concerned; * co-ordinating a network of Official Medicines Control Laboratories (OMCLs) Network» to collaborate and share expertise between member states and optimise the use of available resources, with the aim of achieving effective independent quality control of medicines in Europe and beyond; * proposing ethical, safety and quality standards for blood transfusions (collection, preparation, storage, distribution and appropriate use of blood components)of reference of the European Committee on blood transfusion (CD-P-TS)\\" and the transplantation of organs, tissues and cells;of Reference of the European Committee on Organ Transplantation (CD-P-TO)\\" * working with national, European and international organisations in the fight against falsification of medical products and similar crimes ; * providing policies and model approaches for the safe use of medicines in Europe, including guidelines on pharmaceutical care; and * establishing standards for cosmetics and food contact materials and articles, and co-ordinating the independent control of cosmetics.  Activities related to the quality of medicines = The European Pharmacopoeia: setting quality standards for Europe and beyond and supplying pharmaceutical reference standards  Published and regularly updated by the EDQM/Council of Europe in English and French, the two official languages of the Council of Europe, the Ph. Eur. is a compendium of official quality standards for medicines and their ingredients. It thus helps define the requirements to be met by manufacturers seeking to obtain Marketing Authorisation (MA) for a (human or veterinary) medicinal product in Europe, but its standards are also recognised and used worldwide as a scientific benchmark in the field of quality control for human and veterinary medicines. These common harmonised quality standards – known as monographs – describe strict specifications for medicines and the substances used in their manufacture, that apply throughout the product’s entire life cycle. When adopted, they are legally binding and become mandatory on the same date in the 39 European countries ) that are signatories to the Ph. Eur. convention), applying to all medicines on their markets. The contents of the Ph. Eur. are elaborated and updated by the Ph. Eur. Commission,European Pharmacopoeia Commission» which is responsible for overseeing the practical work of more than 800 experts in every field of the pharmaceutical sciences – all volunteers – who participate in currently 61 groups of experts and working parties. The Ph. Eur. Commission decides on the work programme,Work Programme of the European Pharmacopoeia (March 2020)\\" appoints the experts and adopts the monographs and other texts that comprise the Ph. Eur. (Articles 6 and 7, Ph. Eur. convention). It meets three times a year in Strasbourg (France) and takes all technical decisions by a unanimous vote. The EDQM provides the scientific secretariat and logistical support for the work of the Ph. Eur. Commission, and facilitates the activities of its groups of experts and working parties. The texts of the Ph. Eur. cover all therapeutic areas and comprise: * individual monographs describing legally binding quality standards for medicines and the ingredients used in their manufacture (active ingredients, excipients, herbals, etc.); * individual monographs describing legally binding quality standards for medicinal products; * general monographs describing legally binding quality standards for classes of substances (such as fermentation products or substances for pharmaceutical use) or for the different dosage forms that medicines can take (tablets, capsules, injections, etc.); and, * general methods of analysis for substances used in the manufacture of medicines, which are not legally binding and may also be used for substances and medicines not described in the Ph. Eur. All the analytical methods described in the monographs are experimentally verified. In addition, the EDQM is responsible for establishing and supplying the official reference standards without which it would be impossible to carry out many of the mandatory quality control tests described in the Ph. Eur. These physical standards are used by manufacturers located both in Europe and around the world, and national and European authorities involved in the quality control of medicines, to name but a few. The EDQM publishes a new edition of the Ph. Eur. every three years. The current Chair of the Commission is Professor Torbjörn Arvidsson, who was elected in March 2019 for three years.press release: Outcome of the 163rd Session of the European Pharmacopoeia Commission\\"  The Certification procedure:Policy Documents & Guidelines\\" evaluating the quality of active ingredients and excipients and inspecting manufacturing sites The EDQM runs a quality evaluation programme for active ingredients and excipients used in the manufacture of medicines. The Certification of Suitability& Legal Framework for the procedure for ‘Certification of Suitability to the monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia'\\" to the Monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia procedure was initially set up in 1992 as a pilot programme but went on to become routine for chemical substances in 1994; it was expanded in 2003 to include herbal drugs (active substances obtained from plants).AP-CSP (07) 1 (adopted by the Public Health Committee (Partial Agreement) (CD-P-SP) on 21/02/2007) Certification of suitability to the monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia (revised version)s\\" Granted after an assessment of the documentation submitted by the applicant, a Certificate of Suitability (CEP) provides proof that the methods used by a manufacturer or distributer result in an product whose quality complies with the requirements laid down in the corresponding Ph. Eur. monograph(s). The EDQM also runs an inspection programme for CEP-holders, targeting their manufacturing and/or distribution sites. The Certification procedure is not compulsory: it is a service that is offered to manufacturers who can submit their CEP in the quality section of a new marketing authorisation (MA) application or a variation of an existing MA. It serves to centralise the evaluation of data for the benefit of both regulatory authorities and industry, thus saving time and resources. A further advantage of the Certification procedure is that it provides the Ph. Eur. CommissionEuropean Pharmacopoeia Commission\\" with up-to-date information on the quality of substances on the European market, highlighting where Ph. Eur. texts and quality requirements might require revision and helping to ensure that the pharmacopoeia remains state-of-the-art. CEPs – which are referred to in EU pharmaceutical legislation – are accepted by the Ph. Eur. member states and by a number of other countries and regions, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan and Tunisia. An increasing number of licensing authorities worldwide accept CEPs to support (fully or partially) the data related to the quality of active ingredients used in medicinal products. As previously stated, a CEP is granted after members of the EDQM’s panel of assessors (drawn from national medicines agencies throughout Europe) have reviewed a detailed dossier submitted by the manufacturer. This dossier describes the manufacturing process and the tests performed on the raw materials and on the substance produced, as well as the necessary in-process controls. The manufacturer must demonstrate that the article complies with the quality standards laid down in Ph. Eur. and the EU legislation and that the monograph can be used to control impurities, unwanted chemicals that can be present in a substance for a variety of reasons. The applicant must also agree to comply with the relevant EU Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines (GMP guide) as defined in Part II of the GMP Guide,on good manufacturing practice and good distribution practice: Questions and answers\\" and to accept an on site inspection at any time at the request of the EDQM.  The OMCL Network: quality control of medicines on the market  On 26 May 1994, the European Commission and the Council of Europe decided to launch a new, jointly funded, co-operative venture targeting the quality control of medicines for human and veterinary use on the market, called the European Network of Official Medicines Control Laboratories (OMCLs). Open to both member states and observers of the Ph. Eur. convention,\\"Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia ETS No.: 050, Treaty Office, Council of Europe\\" this network is made up of independent public laboratories that have been appointed by their respective national authorities. Their primary mission is to ensure, through random sample testing, that medicines supplied to patients – wherever they are in Europe – comply with the applicable quality standards and the terms and conditions of their MA. The laboratories that form the network share resources, expertise and workloads: this not only contributes to reducing public health expenditure, a broader coverage of medicines on the market and to the development of future harmonised common standards, but means that laboratories across Europe have access to state-of- the-art technology and selective analytical procedures. Nowadays many laboratories within the network have seen a significant shift from medicines on the market testing to the analysis of falsified and illegal medicines on behalf of other authorities such as customs, police, enforcement/food inspectors and courts. The EDQM is responsible for co-ordinating the network’s technical activities and ensuring the smooth running of its various joint programmes. The OMCL Network performs studies on medicinal products already on the market (market surveillance studies). The EDQM organises inter-laboratory testing activities for OMCLs to improve their analytical performance (proficiency testing scheme [PTS])and Biological PTS \\" studies and promotes common quality management systems in all OMCLs to enable work-sharing and mutual recognition of test results. The EDQM also provides the technical secretariat for the Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR)Release for Human Biologicals: vaccines, blood and plasma derivatives\\" procedures for human and veterinary immunological medicinal products (e.g. vaccines) and human blood-derived medicinal products (e.g. clotting factor, immunoglobulin, albumin. For example, the OCABR procedure guarantees that for the vast majority of the vaccines used in the EU, no batch of vaccine is released to the market in member states without first undergoing an independent quality control by a laboratory of the OMCL Network in addition to the release test conducted by the manufacturer.  Pharmaceutical care and combating falsified medical products  According to the WHOuse of medicines\\"), it is estimated that half of all medicines worldwide are inappropriately prescribed, dispensed or sold, and that half of all patients fail to take their medicines properly. Errors related to medication use, lack of documentation on how medicines are prescribed, used and dispensed, as well as insufficient communication have a considerable impact on national mortality and morbidity rates. Therefore, the safe and appropriate use of medicines, which depends on the right information being available to those that need it, is as important as product quality. In order to face this challenge while taking into account current constraints on public health budgets and social inequality in access to healthcare, the European Committee on Pharmaceuticals and Pharmaceutical Care (CD-P-PH)of the European Committee on Pharmaceuticals and Pharmaceutical Care (CD-P-PH)\\"), which is co-ordinated by the EDQM, oversees the work of experts in three main areas: * The classification of medicines authorised in Europe into prescription and non-prescription medicines: although the responsibility for classifying medicines lies with the individual member state, the CD-P-PH issues classification recommendations. These recommendations may also cover medicines that are not licensed for use in the EU, since the EDQM has a broader membership and CD-P-PH members include representatives of member states that are not part of the EU. The recommendations are updated annually and published on the EDQM’s website. The EDQM also hosts the publicly available Melclass database,Database\\" which presents the classification status of medicines in Ph. Eur. member states. * Setting quality and safety standards in pharmaceutical practices and pharmaceutical care: public authorities and the pharmaceutical industry devote much of their resources to ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines. However, the best treatment outcomes are only achieved when medicines are used safely and appropriately. The CD-P-PH develops scientific indicators to measure the quality of pharmaceutical care in Europe, a concept defined as “the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve a patient’s quality of life”. The indicators developed by the EDQM provide practical information that is of use to policymakers and professional associations on a daily basis, helping to make healthcare systems more responsible and cost-effective. * Preventing and managing risks posed by falsified medical products: falsified medical products pose a growing and real threat to public health in Europe and world-wide. Falsified medicines and medical devices may contain poor quality ingredients, the wrong dosage of an active substance, a different active substance or even a poisonous substance, they may be deliberately mislabelled or have fake packaging or ingredients. To combat this problem, the Council of Europe established the MEDICRIME Convention (CETS No. 211)of Europe Convention on the counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes involving threats to public health\\"), the first international treaty to criminalise the falsification of medical products and similar crimes with a view to protecting public health. The convention entered into force on 1 January 2016.  Activities related to patient and consumer protection = Blood Transfusion  The work of the EDQM in the area of blood transfusion is co-ordinated by the European Committee on Blood Transfusion (CD-P-TS)of reference of the European Committee on Blood Transfusion (CD-P-TS)\\"), which consists of representatives from authorities working in the field of blood transfusion or at national blood establishments (BEs) from member states of the Council of Europe and observers such as the European Commission, WHO, the USFDA and the Council of Europe’s Committee on Bioethics (DH-BIO)). These experts work together on the ethical, legal and organisational aspects of blood transfusion with a view to ensuring quality, increasing availability, avoiding wastage, ensuring optimal use of blood supplies and analysing the possible ethical and organisational impact of new scientific developments. One outcome of this work, the “Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components”to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components\\"), provides recommendations on blood collection, blood components, technical procedures, transfusion practices and quality systems for BEs. Through its Blood Proficiency Testing Scheme and Blood Quality Management ProgrammeProficiency Testing Scheme (B-PTS)\\") the committee helps Council of Europe member states improve their blood transfusion services, ensuring the transfer of knowledge and expertise through training and networking and the monitoring of practices in Europe. They also assess epidemiological risks, in particular those related to the emergence of new infectious agents transmissible by blood transfusion.  Organ, tissue and cell transplantation  The work of the Council of Europe in the area of organ, tissue and cell transplantation began in 1987. The guiding principles for the EDQM’s activities in this area are ensuring human dignity, maintaining and fulfilling human rights and fundamental freedoms, non-commercialisation of substances of human origin and protecting donors and recipients of organs, tissues and cells. This latter principle is fulfilled by improving and promoting strict standards for quality and safety in order to protect not only the donor and recipient, but also the precious donated organ/tissue itself. The European Committee on Organ Transplantation (CD-P- TO)Committee on Organ Transplantation (CD-P-TO)\\") is the steering committee in charge of transplantation activitiesSteering Committee (CD-P-TO) \\"). This committee consists of representatives from member states of the Council of Europe, and observers including the European Commission, WHO, the DH-BIO, Eurotransplant, Scandiatransplant, the European Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT), The Transplantation Society (TTS), the European Association of Tissue and Cells Banks (EATCB), the European Eye Bank Association (EEBA), the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA). It actively promotes the non-commercialisation of donation, the fight against organ/tissue and cell trafficking and the development of ethical, quality and safety standards in the field of organ, tissue and cell transplantation. An important part of the CD-P-TO’s work is the development and publication of two major guides: the “Guide to the quality and safety of organs for transplantation”Tissues and Cells - Technical Guides\\") and the “Guide to the quality and safety of tissues and cells for human application”to the quality and safety of tissues and cells for human application\\"). The EDQM organises a European Day for Organ Donation and Transplantation (EODD)Day for Organ Donation and Transplantation\\") together with a different member state every year, to raise awareness of the importance of organ donation and transplantation in its member states and to encourage public debate and reflection on this life-saving therapy.  Cosmetics and food contact materials  Since 1 January 2009, the EDQM has worked on strengthening consumer health protection in Europe, with a focus on the safe use and quality of cosmetics and materials and articles in contact with foodstuffs. The European Committee on Cosmetics and Consumer Health (CD- P-COS)of Reference of the European Committee for Cosmetics and Consumer Health\\") is tasked with responding to emerging risks for health arising from the use of cosmetics. By promoting the principles laid down in Council of Europe Resolution ResAP(2008)1 on requirements and criteria for the safety of tattoos and permanent make-upResAP(2008)1 on requirements and criteria for the safety of tattoos and permanent make-up (superseding Resolution ResAP(2003)2 on tattoos and permanent make-up)\\"), the committee also works to ensure the safety of these products. Activities on the work programme focus on fostering collaboration between member states and observers. The CD-P-COS) oversees the European Network of Official Cosmetics Control Laboratories (OCCLs)Network of Official Cosmetics Control Laboratories (OCCL)\\"). This network was established in 2010 to maximise the efficiency of cosmetics surveillance by strengthening cross-border collaboration and pooling resources to perform Europe-wide market surveillance studies. Several control laboratories in Asia also take part. In addition to market surveillance studies, network activities include analytical development, PTS studies and the implementation of harmonised quality management systems. Priority is given to testing products that may present a health risk for consumers, either linked to the presence of prohibited or restricted substances (according to EU legislation) or trace metals. The network also publishes test methods after performing inter-laboratory trials to confirm that these methods are fit for purpose. The European Committee for Food Contact Materials and Articles (CD-P-MCA)of Reference of the European Committee for Food Contact Materials and Articles (CD-P-MCA)\\") is tasked with developing and strengthening harmonised measures that supplement EU and national legislation to ensure the safety of packaging, containers, utensils and other materials and articles for food contact. It is supported by two subordinate bodies: the working group on food contact materials made from paper and board and the working group on printed food contact materials. The technical guides published by the CD-P-MCA<)) are used as reference documents by manufacturers and other business operators, safety evaluators and control laboratories.

Concept The story of the album features the following characters: The Narrator's Mother (a wise and benevolent witch-style woman that dedicated her entire life to guide people in their ways to redemption), The Narrator (the younger brother, permanently handicapped since birth, a very intelligent man that constantly deals with his inner doubts), The Narrator's Brother (the older brother, with an impressive skill to be a leader, but he corrupts all the villagers to make them follow him as a sect leader), The Narrator's Daughter (a young girl that inherited the wisdom and skills from her grandmother and was raised by her father to use her powers for good), The Brother's Wife (the wife of the older brother and the secret love for the younger, she discovers the truth about her husband but refuses to leave his side) and The Sect (the villagers, corrupted by the older brother who wanted to lead them to redemption although he could not do that). The first track of the album, \\"Tales from Heaven or Hell\\", talks about the narrator's daughter, who, after her father's death, decides to fulfill his last will: to read his secret diary to \\"discover the truth about her origin\\", and to shed his ashes over a small unknown town. However, she is afraid that her father lied to her about everything. The second track, \\"Die Stadt\\", describes the town as it looks like now, and then it starts talking a little about how the town used to be according to the narrator's memories. \\"Show Me the Way\\" talks about the narrator's mother and her theory about the 3x3 notion, that, according to her, can save everyone from illnesses. Also, it tells how seekers of the truth look for her wisdom. The fourth track, \\"Brothers\\", is the first track about the two brothers' relationship. The song says that, although the younger brother (the narrator) was physically handicapped since he was born, his older brother does not abandon him, even after their mother's premature death. The song describes the older brother as a man that \\"everyone follows and listens to\\" due to his leadership skills. Finally, it talks about an \\"eternal vow\\" that both brothers made in front of their mother's tomb, swearing that they would be together forever, and that they would follow her steps no matter what happened then. The next part of the story includes a non-album track, featured only on the \\"Show Me the Way\\" MCD: \\"Salvation\\". It narrates how the younger brother discovered that all he always feared had already happened: his older brother had become a sect leader, and all the people in the town blindly followed him, because he promised them redemption. He wants to stop his older brother before something terrible happens, and he starts planning how to do that, and to remind him the promise they both made to her mother; this part is told in \\"Seit dem Anbeginn der Zeit\\". The next two tracks, \\"Remember the Promise\\" and \\"Phoenix from the Ashes\\", are involved with the big discussion between the two brothers. The first, \\"Remember the Promise\\", talks about what the narrator told his brother to make him stop before it's too late, and why he could not take anyone safely to salvation; and \\"Phoenix from the Ashes\\" is the answer of the older brother, his frustration and his negative reaction to his younger brother's words. Meanwhile, the older brother's wife discovers the truth about her husband's mistakes and what could happen if he does not stop pretending to save everyone. She wonders how long she'll be able to stand without being hurt, and all her thoughts can be listened in the next track, \\"How Long\\". When she finally has decided to leave her husband, her fears stop her, and chooses to stay with him to try to save him. But it's obviously clear that the older brother somehow influenced her final decision (maybe because they had a little daughter). Innocent Hearts talks about this decision. However, she still doubts about what she chose, and she hopes that her husband remembers how their lives together used to be before the turned into a sect leader, when everything was beauty and pureness. The track \\"These Days Are Gone\\" (the second non-album track, featured on the MCD) narrates her faith on returning to those wonderful times. The next track's story, \\"Forgotten Love\\", takes place one year after that crucial decision. Now, the younger brother has withdrawn himself from his brother and the entire community. He spends his time at his favorite place on the hills, while he thinks about his lost love, and wondering how the situation is on the town. He recalls his lost hopes, dreams and good times; but there's nothing he can do. \\"The Burning\\" is the climax of the story. It tells about what happened when, one day in the afternoon, while spending his time thinking at the hills, the younger brother looked at the town and discovered that the city hall (where the meetings of his brother's sect took place) was on fire. He ran as fast as he could to the city hall to try to save everyone he could, but it was too late: his brother provoked somehow a big fire, and only then the people understood that he was not a redeemer after all, and that nobody could be their redeemer. The only person that the younger brother managed to save from the flames was his brother's little daughter, whom he decided to raise as his own daughter to teach her not to make the same mistakes her father made. Everyone else (including the older brother and his wife) died, and the whole town was reduced to ashes. Now, ten years later, after reading the entire tale on her father's diary, that young girl realized why her father showed her to use her skills only for good. Also, she understood why that dark and ruined town was a special place for her father. 'Ashes to Ashes', she read, interpreting that as some kind of calling the lost souls that died on the town back then were sending to her father and, someday, they would send her, too. However, that would not be the end of the story... and the track \\"A New Decade\\" tells it clearly. And the final track (the third non-album track featured on the MCD), In Einem Verlassenen Zimmer, talks about the place where that young woman discovered all the truth about her origin, and especially what was about to happen after that. The song is taken from a poem of the same name by Georg Trakl. The bonus track \\"Heaven and Hell\\" has little or nothing to do with the concept. It is simply a cover of a Black Sabbath song.

(Lewis) Francis Herreshoff (November 11, 1890 - December 1972), was a boat designer, naval architect, editor and author of books and magazine articles. Early in his career he worked for the Herreshoff Manufacturing and for naval architect Starling Burgess. Biography He was born on November 11, 1890 in Bristol, Rhode Island to Clara Anna DeWolf and Nathanael Greene Herreshoff. After naval service and work for Starling Burgess, in 1926 he became self- employed, designing both racing and cruising sailing yachts, plus many canoes, kayaks and other small craft. He died in December 1972. Herreshoff was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2014. Notable designs Herreshoff's designs included: * A series of graceful clipper-bowed ketches: Ticonderoga 72 ft, Tioga/Bounty 57 ft, Mobjack 45 Ft and Nereia 36 * A shoal- draft leeboarder: Meadowlark * Arguably the original \\"passagemaker\\"; the inspiration for Beebe's book, and an indirect inspiration for Perry's \\"container boat\\": Marco Polo. * His answer to Hanna's ideas about the ideal homebuild: H-28 * The Merlin, sunk on July 7, 1999 by a humpback whale in Whale Bay, Baranof Island, Alaska. *Buzzards Bay 14 Publications His books include The Common Sense of Yacht Design, The Compleat Cruiser, Capt.

It takes a locally integrable function f : Rd → C and returns another function Mf that, at each point x ∈ Rd, gives the maximum average value that f can have on balls centered at that point. More precisely, : Mf(x)=\\\\sup_{r>0} \\\\frac{1}{B(x, r)}\\\\int_{B(x, r)} f(y)\\\\, dy where B(x, r) is the ball of radius r centred at x, and E denotes the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure of E ⊂ Rd. The averages are jointly continuous in x and r, therefore the maximal function Mf, being the supremum over r > 0, is measurable. It is not obvious that Mf is finite almost everywhere. This is a corollary of the Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality. Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality This theorem of G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood states that M is bounded as a sublinear operator from the Lp(Rd) to itself for p > 1. That is, if f ∈ Lp(Rd) then the maximal function Mf is weak L1-bounded and Mf ∈ Lp(Rd). Before stating the theorem more precisely, for simplicity, let {f > t} denote the set {x  f(x) > t}. Now we have: > Theorem (Weak Type Estimate). For d ≥ 1 and f ∈ L1(Rd), there is a constant > Cd > 0 such that for all λ > 0, we have: :\\\\left {Mf > \\\\lambda} \\\\right > < \\\\frac{C_d}{\\\\lambda} \\\\Vert f\\\\Vert_{L^1 (\\\\mathbf{R}^d)}. With the Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality in hand, the following strong- type estimate is an immediate consequence of the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem: > Theorem (Strong Type Estimate). For d ≥ 1, 1 < p ≤ ∞, and f ∈ Lp(Rd), there > is a constant Cp,d > 0 such that : \\\\Vert Mf\\\\Vert_{L^p (\\\\mathbf{R}^d)}\\\\leq > C_{p,d}\\\\Vert f\\\\Vert_{L^p(\\\\mathbf{R}^d)}. In the strong type estimate the best bounds for Cp,d are unknown. However subsequently Elias M. Stein used the Calderón-Zygmund method of rotations to prove the following: > Theorem (Dimension Independence). For 1 < p ≤ ∞ one can pick Cp,d = Cp > independent of d. Proof While there are several proofs of this theorem, a common one is given below: For p = ∞, the inequality is trivial (since the average of a function is no larger than its essential supremum). For 1 < p < ∞, first we shall use the following version of the Vitali covering lemma to prove the weak-type estimate. (See the article for the proof of the lemma.) > Lemma. Let X be a separable metric space and \\\\mathcal{F} a family of open > balls with bounded diameter. Then \\\\mathcal{F} has a countable subfamily > \\\\mathcal{F}' consisting of disjoint balls such that :\\\\bigcup_{B \\\\in > \\\\mathcal{F}} B \\\\subset \\\\bigcup_{B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F'}} 5B where 5B is B with 5 > times radius. If Mf(x) > t, then, by definition, we can find a ball Bx centered at x such that :\\\\int_{B_x} fdy > tB_x. By the lemma, we can find, among such balls, a sequence of disjoint balls Bj such that the union of 5Bj covers {Mf > t}. It follows: :{Mf > t} \\\\le 5^d \\\\sum_j B_j \\\\le {5^d \\\\over t} \\\\int fdy. This completes the proof of the weak-type estimate. We next deduce from this the Lp bounds. Define b by b(x) = f(x) if f(x) > t/2 and 0 otherwise. By the weak-type estimate applied to b, we have: :{Mf > t} \\\\le {2C \\\\over t} \\\\int_{f > \\\\frac{t}{2}} fdx, with C = 5d. Then :\\\\Mf\\\\_p^p = \\\\int \\\\int_0^{Mf(x)} pt^{p-1} dt dx = p \\\\int_0^\\\\infty t^{p-1} { Mf > t } dt By the estimate above we have: :\\\\Mf\\\\_p^p \\\\leq p \\\\int_0^\\\\infty t^{p-1} \\\\left ({2C \\\\over t} \\\\int_{f > \\\\frac{t}{2}} fdx \\\\right ) dt = 2C p \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\int_{f > \\\\frac{t}{2}} t^{p-2} f dx dt = C_p \\\\f\\\\_p^p where the constant Cp depends only on p and d. This completes the proof of the theorem. Note that the constant C=5^d in the proof can be improved to 3^d by using the inner regularity of the Lebesgue measure, and the finite version of the Vitali covering lemma. See the Discussion section below for more about optimizing the constant. Applications Some applications of the Hardy–Littlewood Maximal Inequality include proving the following results: * Lebesgue differentiation theorem * Rademacher differentiation theorem * Fatou's theorem on nontangential convergence. * Fractional integration theorem Here we use a standard trick involving the maximal function to give a quick proof of Lebesgue differentiation theorem. (But remember that in the proof of the maximal theorem, we used the Vitali covering lemma.) Let f ∈ L1(Rn) and :\\\\Omega f (x) = \\\\limsup_{r \\\\to 0} f_r(x) - \\\\liminf_{r \\\\to 0} f_r(x) where :f_r(x) = \\\\frac{1}{B(x, r)} \\\\int_{B(x, r)} f(y) dy. We write f = h + g where h is continuous and has compact support and g ∈ L1(Rn) with norm that can be made arbitrary small. Then :\\\\Omega f \\\\le \\\\Omega g + \\\\Omega h = \\\\Omega g by continuity. Now, Ωg ≤ 2Mg and so, by the theorem, we have: :\\\\left  { \\\\Omega g > \\\\varepsilon } \\\\right  \\\\le \\\\frac{2A}{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\g\\\\_1 Now, we can let \\\\g\\\\_1 \\\\to 0 and conclude Ωf = 0 almost everywhere; that is, \\\\lim_{r \\\\to 0} f_r(x) exists for almost all x. It remains to show the limit actually equals f(x). But this is easy: it is known that \\\\f_r - f\\\\_1 \\\\to 0 (approximation of the identity) and thus there is a subsequence f_{r_k} \\\\to f almost everywhere. By the uniqueness of limit, fr → f almost everywhere then. Discussion It is still unknown what the smallest constants Cp,d and Cd are in the above inequalities. However, a result of Elias Stein about spherical maximal functions can be used to show that, for 1 < p < ∞, we can remove the dependence of Cp,d on the dimension, that is, Cp,d = Cp for some constant Cp > 0 only depending on p. It is unknown whether there is a weak bound that is independent of dimension. There are several common variants of the Hardy- Littlewood maximal operator which replace the averages over centered balls with averages over different families of sets. For instance, one can define the uncentered HL maximal operator (using the notation of Stein-Shakarchi) : f^*(x) = \\\\sup_{x \\\\in B_x} \\\\frac{1}{B_x} \\\\int_{B_x} f(y) dy where the balls Bx are required to merely contain x, rather than be centered at x. There is also the dyadic HL maximal operator :M_\\\\Delta f(x) = \\\\sup_{x \\\\in Q_x} \\\\frac{1}{Q_x} \\\\int_{Q_x} f(y) dy where Qx ranges over all dyadic cubes containing the point x. Both of these operators satisfy the HL maximal inequality. References *John B. Garnett, Bounded Analytic Functions. Springer-Verlag, 2006 *Antonios D.

It was built in 1858 for the couple as a wedding gift by the bride's father, Major Lawson D. Franklin. Robert Armstrong's father, Drury Armstrong, gave them the land. The Armstrongs named the house after Charles Dickens' \\"Bleak House\\" novel of the same name.A Brief History of Confederate Memorial Hall, United Daughters of the Confederacy, accessed October 24, 2008 The bricks in the house were molded on-site using slave labor.East Tennessee's Mountain War Historical Sites, Tennessee Historical Commission The home was used by Confederate Generals James Longstreet and Lafayette McLaws as their headquarters from November 17th to December 4th of 1863 during the Battle of Knoxville. Three Confederate sharpshooters who were stationed in the house's tower were killed by Union cannonballs. Two of the cannonballs are still embedded in the walls, and Civil War-era sketches of the slain soldiers are displayed on the walls of the tower. The home now belongs to local Chapter 89 of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and is commonly called Confederate Memorial Hall.

Some examples are rhodopsin in the photoreceptor cells of the vertebrate retina, phytochrome in plants, and bacteriorhodopsin and bacteriophytochromes in some bacteria. They mediate light responses as varied as visual perception, phototropism and phototaxis, as well as responses to light-dark cycles such as circadian rhythm and other photoperiodisms including control of flowering times in plants and mating seasons in animals.  Structure  Photoreceptor proteins typically consist of a protein moiety and a non-protein photopigment that reacts to light via photoisomerization or photoreduction, thus initiating a change of the receptor protein which triggers a signal transduction cascade. Pigments found in photoreceptors include retinal (retinylidene proteins, for example rhodopsin in animals), flavin (flavoproteins, for example cryptochrome in plants and animals) and bilin (biliproteins, for example phytochrome in plants).  Photoreceptors in animals  (Also see: Photoreceptor cell) *Melanopsin: in vertebrate retina, mediates pupillary reflex, involved in regulation of circadian rhythms *Photopsin: reception of various colors of light in the cone cells of vertebrate retina *Rhodopsin: green-blue light reception in the rod cells of vertebrate retina *Protein Kinase C: mediates photoreceptor deactivation, and retinal degeneration *OPN5: sensitive to UV-light  Photoreceptors in plants  *UVR8: UV-B light reception *Cryptochrome: blue and UV-A light reception *Phototropin: blue and UV-A light perception (to mediate phototropism and chloroplast movement) *Zeitlupe: blue light entrainment of the circadian clock *Phytochrome: red and far-red light reception All the photoreceptors listed above allow plants to sense light with wavelengths range from 280 nm (UV-B) to 750 nm (far-red light). Plants can use light with different wavelengths as their environment cue for the initiation of important developmental transitions. In plant seeds, the photoreceptor phytochrome is responsible for the process termed photomorphogenesis. This occurs when a seed initially situated in an environment of complete darkness is exposed to light. A brief exposure to electromagnetic radiation, particularly that whose wavelength is within the red and far-red lights, results in the activation of the photorecepter phytochrome within the seed. This in turn sends a signal through the signal transduction pathway into the nucleus, and triggers hundreds of genes responsible for growth and development.

The band was formed in 1988 and continues to make music as of today. They have recorded 7 albums and 14 EPs. Their music is a form of pop also known as the Donosti Sound, a 1990s indie pop movement in San Sebastián. Biography The band's career can be divided into two stages. Initially, their music bore many similarities in sound and attitude with groups known as \\"twee pop\\", in particular those of the legendary UK label Sarah Records and of their countrymen Aventuras de Kirlian. They were also influenced by pop music of the late 1960s like Love, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Velvet Underground, Honeybus, Pic Nic and Vainica Doble,History of the band by their record label Siesta (enter site from main page to read in English) with touches of bossa nova and soul. They have also recognized the influence of French chanson (Serge Gainsbourg and Françoise Hardy). Their lyrics in this first stage reflect everyday life situations, as well as the feelings and concerns of average kids of their age (approximately 18) using a melancholy and evocative but natural tone. Their second stage began with the LP Soidemersol (1997).The group's explanations about the songs of Soidemersol Parting from their usual influences while keeping their own personality, they began to use complex orchestral arrangements in their songs. Their lyrics also began to mature, reflecting more complex sentiments and often being much more bitter and less innocent than before. Today, La Buena Vida is one of the most respected and influential indie pop groups in Spain.

He was the son of Cynfyn and rightful heir to the Ergyng throne which, however, was initially usurped by Gwrfoddw around AD 615. Gwrgan probably fled Ergyng when his inheritance was seized by Gwrfoddw Hen. He appears in four charters in the Book of Llandaff during the episcopate of Bishops Euddogwy and Inabwy. Later, Gwrgan features as king in charters in the Book of Llandaff associated with Bishops Oudoceus and Iunapeius. Gwrgan is referred to as King of Damnonia by William of Malmesbury, who reports the terms of a grant of land made by him to the \\"old church\\" at Glastonbury in AD 601 in the time of Abbot Worgret.Edward Huttom, London, 1919, Highways and Byways of Somerset, p.156. Little else is known of this monarch, despite his epithet \\"the Great\\". However, the overlordship of Glywysing and Gwent may be indicated if he is identified with Gwrgan Frych (the Freckled) who features in the Life of Saint Cadog. This powerful lord who ruled further west in Glywysing, granted the Saint half the fishing rights on the Rivers Usk and Neath in return for the great sword of King Rhun Hir of Gwynedd and a fine new horse with all the trappings. Cadog died a few years before Gwrgan's reign, but the association may have been with the Saint's successors at Llancarfan Abbey. Gwrgan ruled until around AD 645 when his sons, Caradog and Morgan, should have inherited the throne of Ergyng. When Gwrgan died, the throne of Ergyng was inherited, not by his sons, but by Athrwys, the son of his daughter, Onbrawst. It appears that his son-in-law, King Meurig of Glywysing and Gwent, managed to seize power in the name of his son, Athrwys.

Reese has been the head coach of the Texas Longhorns men's swimming and diving team that represents the University of Texas in Austin, Texas since 1978, and previously served as the men's head coach for the United States' Olympic Swimming Team in 2004 and 2008, as well as an assistant coach at the 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2012 Summer Olympics.  Early years  Reese was born in Daytona Beach, Florida in 1941. He attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, and swam for the Mainland Buccaneers high school swim team, winning two state high school championships in the 200-yard individual medley swimming event. He then enrolled in the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he swam for coach Buddy Crone and coach Bill Harlan's Florida Gators swimming and diving teams, leading the Gators to three consecutive Southeastern Conference (SEC) team championships (1961, 1962, 1963). As the team's senior co-captain, Reese became the first Florida swimmer to win five SEC individual titles in a single season—the 200-yard breaststroke, the 200-yard and 400-yard individual medleys, the 400-yard freestyle relay and the 400-yard medley relay. Reese graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1963.  Coaching career  Reese c. 1988 After Reese graduated from Florida, he remained in Gainesville as a graduate assistant coach and earned his master's degree from Florida in 1965. Reese then coached and taught at Roswell High School in Roswell, New Mexico for one year (1965–1966), before returning to the University of Florida as an assistant coach for six seasons (1967–1972). Reese became the head coach of the Auburn Tigers swim team at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama in 1972, leading the Tigers for six seasons (1973–1978). The Tigers were a team that had not qualified a single swimmer for the finals or consolation finals of the SEC championship meet during the previous season. After six seasons, Auburn had produced four consecutive top-ten showings at the NCAA championships, and in his final season at Auburn, the Tigers placed second in the SEC and NCAA championships, the highest finish in program history to that time. In 1978, Reese accepted the head coaching position for the Texas Longhorns men's swimming and diving team of the University of Texas in Austin, Texas. Since that time, his Longhorns team have won 14 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) team championships (1981, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1996, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), and he has been named CSCAA Coach of the Year eight times. Starting with his second year at Texas, his teams have won the conference championship every season (40 in a row as of 2019). Reese has coached numerous current and former world record holders. His recent elite swimmers include Ian Crocker, Rick Carey, Brendan Hansen, Neil Walker, Ricky Berens, Josh Davis, Dave Walters, Garrett Weber-Gale, Eric Shanteau, Scott Spann, Aaron Peirsol and Joseph Schooling.

It is most likely a result of glacial movements in the area and the whole formation is believed to have been carried to the present site by a glacier. The stone is over tall and is entirely a work of erosion. Its peculiar shape was further pronounced as the area was a small rock quarry in past centuries. Despite being an environmentally protected site it is often scaled by climbers and outdoor enthusiasts. It can be reached by following a lengthy tourist trail from Lesko or from a road roughly away. Folklore The stone is an important aspect of local culture with a number of legends related to its shape and origin. The most popular of those is related to the 16th century church in Lesko which claims the stone is a remnant of a failed attempt by the devil to destroy Christianity in the area. A variation of this story links the stone to a number of monasteries in the area. Many more legends exist and some of them are told on plaques currently fixed to the stone. Mentions in Culture Because of its location on the main route through the Bieszczady Mountains the Lesko Stone is mentioned several times in literature. The stone's beauty was an inspiration for a poem specifically about it written by Aleksander Fredro and also appears in his other works. It was also written about by Oskar Kolberg, Stanisław Staszic, and Wincenty Pol among others.

The website was created as an entry into Contagious Media Showdown's contest to see which purpose-built website could spark the most viral interest over a three-week period. Haber Rubinoff and Marsh saw the contest and website as a venue to raise awareness and discussion about gender. They were not expected to win, but their work was picked up by Fark, the College Humor blog and other sites, leading to more than 600,000 sites during the contest period and one million hits in the six months between May and November 2005. Surprising both the creators and the contest organizers, many visitors to the website believed the product to be real and attempted to order the panties or learn how to become a distributor. The creators believe the website's success, which was a significant return on a $18 investment, came from the humor and the fact that it was picked up by key bloggers who helped to spread the word. This resulted in the duo winning the $2,500 grand prize. Other websites created by the duo include: Plastic Assets, which advertised a new credit card that offered free breast implants to young applicants; Christians Against Hip Hop, which tried to save white girls from the \\"dangers\\" of hip hop; and Adopt Black Girls, a fake adoption agency for young girls, which raised awareness about the effects of racist policy after Hurricane Katrina.

The Dent du Géant remained unclimbed during the golden age of alpinism, and was a much-coveted peak in the 1870s, repelling many parties who attempted it mostly from the Rochefort ridge. In 1880 the strong team of Albert F. Mummery and Alexander Burgener tried to force a passage via the south-west face but were repelled by a band of slabs, causing Mummery to exclaim, 'Absolutely inaccessible by fair means!'Quoted in Dumler, Helmut and Willi P. Burkhardt, The High Mountains of the Alps, London: Diadem, 1994, p. 179 The mountain has two summits, apart and separated by a small col (an 'extremely awkward notch' according to W. W.

Niskanen first presented the idea in 1968, and later developed it into a book published in 1971.William A. Niskanen, [1971] 1994. Bureaucracy and Public Economics, Elgar. Expanded ed. Description and review links and review excerpts. According to the budget-maximizing model, rational bureaucrats will always and everywhere seek to increase their budgets in order to increase their own power, thereby contributing strongly to state growth and potentially reducing social efficiency. The bureau-shaping model has been developed as a response to the budget-maximizing model. Niskanen's inspiration could also have been Parkinson's law sixteen years earlier (1955). Niskanen's budget maximizing bureaucrat The model contemplates a bureaucrat who heads a public administration department, and who will try to maximize the department's budget, thus increasing its salary and prestige. There is a demand for the department's services on the part of electors and voters, but, contrary to publicly managed firms, which directly offer their products and services to these electors, the department is responsible for producing the services which will then be supplied by the Legislature to the electors. It will therefore be the legislature, or Government, the agent which defines the department's budget, depending on the quantity which it supplies. The more services the department supplies, the higher will its budget be. Therefore, the bureaucrat's objective will be to maximize the quantity of services supplied, subject to a social welfare break-even constraint. This means that the dead weight loss generated by excessive production of services must never be higher than the elector's consumer surplus (otherwise, the Legislature would notice that something was wrong with the department's activity, which would be causing social losses and not gains). In other words, a typical, private- sector utility maximizing model would anticipate that the department would expand services (and budgets) to the point that the marginal cost and marginal benefits are equated. In Niskanen's model, he would predict that average costs and benefits would be equated instead of the marginals.

He was a professor of anthropology at the University of Washington until his retirement in 1996 after which he was emeritus at the University of Washington as well as Mississippi State University. Among Dunnell's contribution to archaeology was the recognition of the role the theory of biological evolution as a means of explaining cultural phenomena.Dunnell, Robert C. 1982 Science, Social Science, Common Sense. Journal of Anthropological Research 38:1–25, In addition, he argued that \\"cultural evolution\\" which has its roots in 19th Century social scientists such as Lewis Henry Morgan and Herbert Spencer is distinct from \\"scientific evolution\\" which Darwinian in character. Cultural evolution is vitalistic and assumes a direction to the nature of change (i.e., progress).Dunnell, Robert C. 1988. The Concept of Progress in Cultural Evolution. In Evolutionary Progress? M.H. Nitecki, ed. Pp. 169-194. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. Darwinian evolution, Dunnell argues, holds that evolution is a two-step process in which variability generation is separate from mechanisms that sort that variability. While advocating \\"scientific evolution\\" as the basis for anthropological theory, Dunnell argued that the use of a strictly biological model was insufficient to explain cultural variability. He argued that a more comprehensive version of evolutionary theory is needed that considered cultural inheritance as an additional means of the transmission of variability between individuals. Overall, Dunnell advocated the use of a Darwinian model.Dunnell, Robert C. 1978 Style and Function: A Fundamental Dichotomy. American Antiquity 43:192-202. Dunnell's approach advocates the evolutionary model to explain (cultural) variation, while exposing the pitfalls of using analogy to explain historical events.Dunnell, Robert C. 1981 Evolutionary Theory and Archaeology.

Étienne-Jules Marey: Albert Londe's 12-lens camera, 1893 Albert Londe (26 November 1858 – 11 September 1917) was an influential French photographer, medical researcher and chronophotographer. He is remembered for his work as a medical photographer at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, funded by the Parisian authorities, as well as being a pioneer in X-ray photography. During his two decades at the Salpêtrière, Albert Londe developed into arguably the most outstanding scientific photographer of his time. In 1878 neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot hired Londe as a medical photographer at the Salpêtrière. In 1882 Londe devised a system to photograph the physical and muscular movements of patients (including individuals experiencing epileptic seizures). This he accomplished by using a camera with nine lenses that were triggered by electromagnetic energy, and with the use of a metronome he was able to sequentially time the release of the shutters, therefore taking photos onto glass plates in quick succession. A few years later Londe developed a camera with twelve lenses for photographing movement. Londe's camera was also used for medical studies of muscle movement in subjects performing actions as diverse as those of a tightrope-walking and blacksmithing. The sequence of twelve pictures could be created for durations from 1/10 of a second to several seconds. Although the apparatus was used primarily for medical research, Londe noted that it was portable, and he used it for other subjects - for example, horses and other animals and ocean waves. General Sobert developed, in conjunction with Londe, a chronophotographic device used to study ballistics. Londe's pictures were used as illustrations in several books, most notably those by Paul Richer, that were widely read by the medical and artistic fraternity. With Étienne-Jules Marey (1830–1904), Londe performed many photographic experiments of movement, and the layout of his laboratory at the Salpêtrière was similar to Marey's renowned Station Physiologique. In 1893 Londe published the first book on medical photography, titled La photographie médicale: Application aux sciences médicales et physiologiques. In 1898 he published Traité pratique de radiographie et de radioscope: technique et applications médicales. Londe also published six journals. Albert Londe's 12-lens camera of 1891 was illustrated in the journal 'La Nature', 1893.

S. W., 1825, hand-coloured aquatint and etching printed in dark blue ink. Australian print in the tradition of British decorative production. Joseph Lycett (c.1774 – 1828) was a portrait and miniature painter, active in Australia. Lycett specialised in topographical views of the major towns of Australia, and some of its more dramatic landscapes. Early life Lycett was born in Staffordshire, England, where he became a botanical artist. By 1810, Lycett was described by others as an engraver and as a drawer; he was also noted as being a painter of portraits and miniatures. Lycett had a de facto wife, Mary Stokes, known as Mary Lycett. Convict years=Newcastle Lycett was convicted of forgery on 10 August 1811, having been prosecuted by the injured party: the Bank of England. He was transported to Australia, sailing aboard the General Hewitt and arriving in Sydney on 7 February 1814. Lycett's first employment in Australia was as an artist for Absalom West and he reported in the October 1814 muster as a limner (painter). West left the colony in December 1814 and Lycett had to find a new position; by May 1815 Lycett was employed in the police office. At this time Sydney was flooded by hundreds of skilfully forged 5 shilling bills drawn on the postmaster. They were traced to Lycett, who was found in possession of a small copper-plate press. Lycett was sent to Newcastle on the Lady Nelson, where he came to the attention of the commandant of the settlement, Captain James Wallis. Lycett drew up the plans for a church which Wallis projected and, when it was built in 1818, he painted the altar piece; he is said to have also produced the three-light window which still survives in the bishop's vestry of Newcastle Cathedral. On the recommendation of the commandant, Captain James Wallis of the 46th Regiment, Lycett was given a conditional pardon. While there he also painted Corroboree at Newcastle, the first known oil painting to depict an Aboriginal corroboree at night. This painting has also been attributed to Wallis. =Collectors' Chests= Collector's chest featuring Lycett's paintings. The chest is believed to have been presented to Lachlan Macquarie by Captain James Wallis, ca. 1818 Captain James Wallis also involved Lycett in the design of two cedar and rosewood timber chests displaying natural history specimens from the Newcastle area. Lycett was responsible for painting eight of the twelve panels on these chests which depict views of Newcastle as well as copies of William Westall's Views of Australian Scenery. It is strongly believed that Wallis presented one of these chests to Governor Lachlan Macquarie as a gift around the year of 1818. The other chest's initial provenance is unknown, but it was purchased by William Dixson in London in 1937 and later bequeathed to the State Library of New South Wales where Macquarie's chest is also held. Sydney Lycett returned to Sydney and was allowed to practice his art, and in 1820 Governor Macquarie sent three of his paintings including a large view of Sydney to Earl Bathurst. It is generally believed that the absolute pardon which Lycett received on 28 November 1821 was a reward for these pictures. Many of his patrons seem to have been drawn from the military and public service elite, and included Commissioner John Thomas Bigge (who described Lycett's \\"habits of intoxication\\" as \\"fixed and incurable\\"), his secretary Thomas Hobbes Scott, and Macquarie's aide-de-camp John Watts. Lycett had possibly married in the colony, for on 21 June 1822 he advertised in The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser that he intended to leave accompanied by his two daughters, Mary Ann and Emma. They sailed together in the Shipley on 8 September 1822. Views in Australia Lycett, J. (1824). Views in Australia, or, New South Wales & Van Diemen's Land delineated : In fifty views with descriptive letter press ... by J. Lycett. London, J. Souter., MRB/ F980.1/ L Although his later publication Views in Australia suggests Lycett also visited Tasmania, there is no evidence of his actually travelling there. He returned to England in September 1822, having been granted an absolute pardon. With publisher John Souter, between July 1824 and June 1825 he issued Views in Australia, or New South Wales and Van Diemens Land in 13 parts published monthly, each with two aquatint views of New South Wales and two of Van Diemen's Land, with descriptive letterpress, and a supplement with maps of both colonies.Issued in 13 parts with plates dated July 1824 - June 1825, and subsequently as one volume. Plates are coloured. By permission the series was dedicated to Bathurst. The parts began to appear in July 1824 at 7s. plain and 10s. 6d. coloured. With its complicated publishing history, the extent of Lycett's involvement in the entire production is unclear, and it does seem that the book was not successful. These views were reissued in a volume in 1825, that was reprinted in 1971. The 50 plates are coloured in some copies and plain in others. Death Lycett died in Birmingham on 9 February 1828 and was buried in St Mary's Churchyard, Birmingham. A pencilled note in a copy of his Views in the State Library of New South Wales, states that, when he was living near Bath, he was again arrested for forgery of some notes on the Stourbridge Bank. On being arrested he cut his throat, and when recovering in hospital he tore open the wound and killed himself. However, this is not confirmed.

She was the lead ship in a class of twelve and was named for the Island of Luzon, the chief island in the northern Philippines and site of the capital city of Manila. She is the second US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction Luzon was laid down 8 April 1943, as liberty ship SS Samuel Bowles, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCE hull 981, by the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., in Baltimore, Maryland; launched 14 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. H. E. Sigman; acquired by the Navy and renamed Luzon 24 May 1943; commissioned 12 October 1943, with Commander Elmer R. Runquist, in command. Service history=World War II After shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, she departed Norfolk, Virginia 28 November, for duty in the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal 6 December, and arrived the Ellice Islands 3 January 1944. Assigned to Service Squadron 4, she operated at Funafuti and provided repair facilities for amphibious, patrol, and landing craft. Following the invasion of the Marshall Islands on 31 January, she steamed for Kwajalein Atoll on 23 February, and arrived there on 4 March. During the next 5 months, she served there as repair ship and tender for harbor craft. As American seapower spearheaded the Allied advance across the Pacific, Luzon steamed to Guam after the conquest of the Marianas. Departing Kwajalein on 2 September, she sailed via Eniwetok and reached Apra, Guam, on 11 September. As a unit of Service Squadron 10, she maintained a busy repair schedule there until 1 March 1945, when she steamed to Saipan for 6 months of duty at that important harbor. Following the surrender of Japan to the Allied Powers, Luzon departed the Marianas on 1 October, for Japanese waters. After touching at Iwo Jima, she reached Wakanoura Wan, Honshū on 8 October. She proceeded to Nagoya, Honshū, 19 December until 22 December, she provided fleet and repair services to ships supporting occupation operations in Japan. She then departed for the United States, and, after touching at Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal, she arrived at Orange, Texas, on 9 February 1946. Assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, she was decommissioned on 24 June 1947. Korean War In response to the outbreak of the Korean War, Luzon was recommissioned on 20 September 1950, Commander Alan B. Sutherland in command. After steaming to Norfolk in early in October, she departed for the West Coast on 15 November. She reached San Diego on 6 December, proceeded to San Francisco on 11 December, and sailed for the Far East on 26 December. She arrived at Sasebo, Kyūshū on 23 January 1951, and during the remainder of the year, she provided valuable repair services for ships of the US 7th Fleet. She departed Japan for the west coast 19 January 1952; after reaching San Francisco on 9 February, she operated out of San Francisco, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and Long Beach during the next 15 months. Departing Long Beach on 2 May 1953, Luzon deployed to the western Pacific and arrived at Sasebo on 2 June. Except for a run to Pusan, South Korea, and back in mid-July, she provided repair facilities at Sasebo until sailing to Yokosuka on 15 January 1954. She departed the Far East for home on 2 February, and arrived at Long Beach on 28 February. She was placed in commission, in reserve on 15 March 1955, while undergoing repair at Mare Island. After returning to San Diego on 29 April, she was placed in service, in reserve. Luzon was recommissioned at San Diego on 3 November, with Commander W. F. Christie in command. After completing training off southern California, she sailed for the Far East on 9 March 1956. She arrived at Sasebo on 9 April, and began duty as station repair ship for Service Squadron 3. During the next 4 years she remained in the western Pacific, supporting peacekeeping operations of the 7th Fleet. Although based at Sasebo, she steamed to Okinawa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and to various Japanese ports while carrying out her assigned tasks. Luzon returned to San Diego on 31 May 1960, then steamed to Mare Island on 3 June, for deactivation. She was decommissioned there on 1 July 1960, and her name was struck from the Naval Register on 1 September 1961. Final disposition Luzon was laid up in the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, California, on 25 August 1960, after being transferred to Maritime Administration (MARAD).

During his clerical years, he married an Ijebu woman who was born into a trading family in Onitsha.

It argues that rational officials will not want to maximize their budgets, but instead to shape their agency so as to maximize their personal utilities from their work. For instance, bureaucrats would prefer to work in small, elite agencies close to political power centres and doing interesting work, rather than to run large-budget agencies with many staff but also many risks and problems. For the same reasons, and to avoid risks, the bureau-shaping model also predicts that senior government bureaucrats will often favour either 'agencification' to other public sector bodies by having policy determination and advice separated from the implementation of the legislated practices of government (as in the UK 'Next Steps' programme, Australian Department - Agency system) or off-loading functions to contractors and privatization. In the health and social work fields, officials will favour 'deinstitutionalization' and 'care in the community'. The model was developed by Patrick Dunleavy from the London School of Economics in Democracy, Bureaucracy and Public Choice (London: Pearson Education, 1991, reissued 2001). It was propounded in response to William Niskanen's harsh criticism of Public Bureaucracies in his Budget Maximising Model. The Niskanen model predicts that in representative democracies, public bureaucracies will not only generate allocative inefficiency (by oversupplying public goods) but also x-inefficiency (by producing public goods inefficiently). It is evident that the Niskanen model is heavily reliant on an American institutional milieu. Patrick Dunleavy, a British political scientist who set out to demolish the public choice arguments on bureaucracy, came instead in the end to develop a public choice model of bureaucratic behaviour which combines elements of Peacock’s insight with the original American model. The Dunleavy (1985, p. 300) model of public bureaucracy is built on six basic assumptions. The first three are consistent with Niskanen’s model: (i) bureau policies are set by bureaucrats interacting with the government; (ii) governments largely depend on information from bureaus about the costs and value of producing within given ranges of output; and (iii) bureaucrats maximise their personal utilities (by satisfying \\"self-regarding, relatively hard-edged preferences\\") when making official decisions. Added to these are two 4 assumptions which greatly weaken the budget-maximising conclusion. These are that a bureau’s aggregate policy behaviour is set by some combination of individual decisions made by its officials, although the actual combination that results may be an outcome desired by no bureau member; and that, within broad limits, officials’ influence on bureau policy is always correlated with rank and those nearest the top of bureaus are the most influential. Dunleavy therefore discards Niskanen’s assumption that a bureau’s behaviour will be wholly in line with the preferences of a single senior bureaucrat. In a bureau, where no individual has complete hegemony, budget maximisation is a collective, not an individual good. Rational utility maximising individuals will thus tend to favour strategies that directly advance their personal interests ahead of strategies that advance the collective good. The interaction of the maximising activities of individuals within a bureau will not necessarily lead to budget maximizing.

The area was originally settled by the Meyer family in the late 19th century. Meyers Mill grew after a train stop was built on a new rail line. In 1951, it was acquired by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission as part of a site for the Savannah River Plant. History=Early history The settlement of the community grew with the construction of the Atlantic Coast Line around 1900 from Denmark, South Carolina, to Robins, South Carolina. Robins was on the railroad from Port Royal to Augusta, Georgia. Robins was also taken for the Savannah River Plant. This line is now part of CSX Transportation. The Meyers Mill community is named after the Meyer family. It was an agricultural community. In the early 1940s, a fire destroyed about half of the community. By the early 1950s, Meyers Mill had a population of about 50, about ten residences, three commercial buildings, one church, one cotton gin, and the railroad station. The people were largely African-Americans. Exodus On November 28, 1950, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company announced that the Savannah River Plant would be built on about 300 sq. mi. of Aiken County, Barnwell County, and Allendale County in South Carolina. The Savannah River Plant was built for the production of plutonium and tritium for the H-bomb. About 6,000 people and 6,000 graves were to be relocated. This include the incorporated communities of Dunbarton and Ellenton and the unincorporated communities of Meyers Mill, Hawthorne, Robbins, and Leigh. A significant fraction of those removed were African- American farmers and sharecroppers. The government purchased or condemned the property. Many of the residents moved themselves, and in some cases, their homes. Geography Dunbarton's location was approximately 33°10'06\\" N and 81°35'48\\" W. It was located north of Meyers Branch at the intersection of the current SRS \\"9\\" and the CSX rail line.

Their poor mother ends up selling all of her belongings except for the clothes on her skin. Finally, impatient and worried, she leaves to search for her husband. After several weeks of waiting for their parents, the three siblings come to terms with the fact that their parents have died. This is when they make their long journey to the other side of Ireland, in search of the long-lost aunts (the only other family members they know of) who they only knew because of their mother's stories.

Luynes is, today, a commune of the Indre-et-Loire département in France.; . The family of Albert, which sprang from Thomas Alberti (died 1455), seigneur de Boussargues, bailli of Viviers and Valence, and viguier of Bagnols Bagnols-sur-Cèze, Gard Provençal and Pont-Saint-Esprit in Languedoc, acquired the estate of Luynes in the 16th century.  History  The grandfather of the first Duke of Luynes was Léon d'Alberti, who changed the family name to Albert and married Jeanne de Ségur of Marseille in 1535. From the marriage he received a dowry of 10,000 livres and the fief of Luynes in today's département Bouches-du-Rhône in Provence. His son Honoré was born five years later. Léon d'Albert died in the Italian Wars. Honoré d'Albert (1540–1592), seigneur de Luynes, was in the service of the three last Valois kings and of Henry IV of France, and became colonel of the French bands, commissary of artillery in Languedoc and governor of Beaucaire. He had three sons: * Charles (1578–1621), a favorite of Louis XIII, became the first duke of Luynes in August 1619. He had recently purchased the Comté de Maillé on the Loire, about 10 miles west of Tours, and the king erected Maillé into the Duchy of Luynes, which included about 50 parishes and extended to the western wall of Tours and around it on three sides. * Honoré (1581–1649), first Duke of Chaulnes, was seigneur de Cadenet and married Charlotte Eugenie d'Ailly, countess of Chaulnes, in 1619, and was created duke of Chaulnes in 1621. He was governor of Picardy and marshal of France (1619), and defended his province successfully in 1625 and 1635. He is also responsible for the French translation of René Descartes's Meditations, from Latin, in 1647. * Léon, seigneur de Brantes, who became duke of Luxembourg-Piney by his marriage in 1620 with Margaret Charlotte of Luxembourg. By her marriage with Claude of Lorraine, duke of Chevreuse, Marie de Rohan, the widow of the first duke of Luynes, acquired in 1655 the duchy of Chevreuse, which she gave in 1663 to Louis Charles d'Albert, her son by her first husband; and from that time the title of duke of Chevreuse and duke of Luynes was borne by the eldest sons of the family of Luynes, which also inherited the title of duke of Chaulnes on the extinction of the descendants of Honoré d'Albert in 1698. The branch of the dukes of Luxemburg-Piney became extinct in 1697. Some other notable family members are: *Louis Auguste d'Albert d'Ailly (1676–1744), duke of Chaulnes, became marshal of France (1741). *Louis Joseph d'Albert de Luynes (1670–1750), 3rd Prince of Grimberghen: married to Magdeleine Marie de Berghes. He was in the service of the Emperor Charles VII, and became field-marshal and ambassador in France. Several members of the family of Albert were distinguished in letters and science. Louis Charles d'Albert (1620–1690), duke of Luynes, son of the constable, was an ascetic writer and friend of the Jansenists; Paul d'Albert de Luynes (1703–1788), Cardinal and archbishop of Sens, an astronomer; Michel Ferdinand d'Albert d'Ailly (1714–1769), duke of Chaulnes, a writer on mathematical instruments, and his son Marie Joseph Louis (1741–1793), a chemist; and Honoré Theodore Paul Joseph (1802–1867), a writer on archaeology.

Often regarded as \\"the father of Paraguayan football\\", Paats' family moved to Asunción, Paraguay in 1894. At that time, William was 18 years old and soon noticed the lack in the formal practice of any sport in Paraguay. After a few years, he became a physical education instructor at the Escuela Normal de Maestros in Asunción. In one of his trips to Buenos Aires, he bought a ball and brought it back to Paraguay; and soon after he started teaching the practice of football to his students. The popularity of football in Paraguay rose immediately. Due to the success and enormous interest of the people, Paats impulsed the foundation of the first Paraguayan football club, and so on 25 July 1902 Club Olimpia was born. Paats was also a founding member of the Liga Paraguaya de Fútbol (Paraguayan Football League) in 1906 and served as President of the mentioned organisation from 1909 to 1910. He also promoted and taught the practice of other sports disciplines such as cricket, tennis, swimming and rowing. His passion for sports and social activities led him to found the social and sports club Sajonia in 1921 and the Touring y Automóvil Club Paraguayo in 1924. He also served as a consul for the Netherlands until 1935. Paats died on 28 August 1946, in Asunción, leaving his legacy as one of the most important sports personalities in Paraguay.

He won the Danish Cup with Randers and the Danish Superliga with AaB. Biography Martin S. Jensen began his career with local amateur club Korup near Odense, before moving to nearby top- flight Superliga club Odense BK (OB) in 1996, where he served as an understudy to Danish international keeper Lars Høgh.http://www.ob.dk/artikel/martin-s- jensen-skifter-til-ob.aspx He moved on to lower-league club Randers Freja, and played almost 100 games for Freja from 1998 to 2000,http://www.randersfc.dk/index.php?afd=1&side;=1188 helping the team win promotion for the second-tier Danish 1st Division. Jensen joined rival Danish 1st Division team Esbjerg fB in the Winter 2000, and eventually surpassed Benny Gall as the starting goalkeeper.Jørn Broch, \\"EfB tager afsked med tre\\", JydskeVestkysten, June 16, 2001. Jensen helped Esbjerg win promotion to the Danish Superliga, and played all 33 games as Esbjerg finished 7th in the 2001–02 Danish Superliga season. In the Winter 2002, Esbjerg brought in new keeper Lars Winde. When Jensen made his dissatisfaction known, he was handed a free transfer,http://www.bold.dk/nyt/index.php?vis=30588 and rejoined with OB in January 2003, signing a two-year contract. At OB, Jensen initially served as the understudy once more, this time to Det Gyldne Bur-winning goalkeeper Karim Zaza. When Zaza was sold in the Summer 2003, Jensen was handed a place in the starting line-up which he kept for 18 games. In the Winter 2003, OB bought a new Det Gyldne Bur-winning keeper in Arek Onyszko, and Jensen was demoted to the bench. In July 2004, Jensen announced his desire to let his OB contract expire at the end of the year 2004, as he had already agreed to join newly promoted team Randers FC, a club merger based on his former team Randers Freja. In August 2004, OB and Randers agreed on a transfer move, allowing Jensen to immediately join Randers.http://www.ob.dk/artikel/martin-s-jensen- skifter-til-randers-fc-med-oejeblikkelig-virkning.aspx At Randers, Jensen quickly established himself as the starting goalkeeper ahead of Christian Kemph. The season did not end well for Jensen, as Randers were relegated to the Danish 1st Division. As a 1st Division team, Randers and Jensen managed to win the 2005–06 Danish Cup, beating Superliga club Esbjerg fB 1-0 in extra time in the final. That same season, Randers won promotion for the Superliga, and Jensen signed a two-year contract extension in June 2006.http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Randers-holder-paa-profil In the following 2006–07 Danish Superliga season, Jensen missed only a single game (through suspension), as Randers finished eighth. When Randers bought Kevin Stuhr Ellegaard as their new starting goalkeeper in the 2007 summer transfer window, Jensen was not allowed to train with the first team, but was instead demoted to the youth team.http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Jensen-maa-ikke-slaas-med-Stuhr- Ellegaard Following a public dispute with Randers due to what Jensen contested as unfair treatment, he was released from all contractual obligations with the club on July 16, 2007.http://www.randersfc.dk/index.php?afd=1&side;=2433 Jensen soon after chose to join AaB Aalborg, signing a half-year contract with the club. He was brought in as a backup keeper, as AaB's newly bought first choice Karim Zaza was still recovering from a shoulder operation. Jensen was AaB's starting goalkeeper in the first seven games of the 2007–08 Danish Superliga season, including a 0-5 defeat to his former team Randers FC, and he also helped AaB beat KAA Gent to advance to the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. When Zaza returned to fitness in September 2007, Jensen found himself as the second choice keeper for the Superliga games, but saw playing time in the Danish Cup tournament instead. In his six months at AaB, Jensen played 12 matches in all competitions for the club, in a season that would ultimately lead to AaB winning the Danish Superliga title in May 2008. By then, Jensen had already moved on. In January 2008, he joined Skive IK in the Danish 1st Division as goalkeeper and assistant manager on a two-year contract.

He remained Lord Privy Seal until 8 July 1323, before being named Lord Chancellor of England on 20 August 1323. Baldock was elected Bishop of Norwich on 23 July 1325, but before consecration resigned the office on 3 September 1325 to avoid a collision between the pope and the King. In October 1326, Baldock was one of the small number of supporters who fled London with King Edward when Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer invaded. He remained with the King and the Despensers, the King's particular favorites, in their flight across England to the Despensers' lands in Wales, and was one of the last handful who attempted to cross to Ireland and failed. He and the King remained fugitives until their hiding place was revealed. Baldock lost his offices and was imprisoned in November 1326. Death Unlike the Despensers, who suffered quick trials and executions, Baldock was a clergyman, and so in February 1327 was sent to London for trial by fellow clergy. He was placed under house arrest at Hereford Palace (the Bishop of Hereford's London residence). A mob broke into the house, severely beat him, and threw him into Newgate Prison, where he was murdered by some of the inmates.

Severely beaten by the crowd, he was kicked and hit with stones as he lay on the street, which continued for more than an hour. Although some local civilians attempted to help, rioters attacked civilians attempting to bring him food and water. He was eventually taken by rioters to his nearby home where he was tortured to death and mutilated beyond recognition. After rioters had left, his body was transferred to Bellevue Hospital.

The Aeroplane: an Historical survey of its Origins and Development (HMSO, London 1960) but the myth frequently reappears in Scottish newspaper articles and most recently in a book published in 2014 with the support of the Dundee Museum of Transport titled The Pioneer Flying Achievements of Preston Watson by Alistair W. Blair and Alistair Smith. Early history He was born in Dundee, Tayside, Scotland on 17 May 1880, the son of Mr Thomas Watson of Balgowan and his wife Jane Preston. His father was partner in Watson & Philip a wholesale food distributor in Dundee.http://bygone.dundeecity.gov.uk/reminiscences/watson- and-philip/index.htmlDundee Post Office Directory 1905 He was a pupil of the High School of Dundee and showed considerable interest in things mechanical from an early age. Young Preston possessed an analytical mind, and quite often, he, according to the Sunday, 27 October 1984 edition of The Courier and Advertiser newspaper; It was in his twenties whilst studying engineering at University College, Dundee that his interest in aeronautics flourished, but, for a keen and impressionable young adult there was little to read on the emerging science of aviation. If aviation was to become the field in which he was going to start a career, he would have to do his own research. His brother James was to later recount in the December 1955 issue of Aeronautics magazine that; According to the late Mr James Manson, who worked as a labourer with Watson's father's food produce business, Messrs Watson and Philip, Preston built small model aeroplanes and dropped them from the bridge at Ninewells. On 25 October 1907 Watson applied for a patent that, \\"...relates to flying machines, the object being to raise and propel a machine through the air without aerostats.\\" Accepted in its entirety nearly a year later, Patent No.23,553 of 1907, titled \\"Watson's Flying Machines\\" comprises eight pages of descriptions of an indigenous rotary-wing means of creating lift and five illustrations to which the description pages are keyed. These show different configurations of aircraft using the same rotary aerofoil devices that resembled the sheathing mechanism of a combine harvester. No evidence survives to suggest Watson began constructing any of the bizarre creations in the patent.Patent No. GB190723553 Flying Machines Accepted in its entirety on 8 October 1908, by that time Watson's ideas on what constituted successful flight, and specifically how lift was achieved had changed dramatically from his patent. In July 1908 Watson published the pamphlet Power Necessary in Flight (John Leng & Co. Ltd. Dundee, 1908), which contained his theories on; \\"...the best curvature of an aerodrome [sic], and, further, the result of a calculation regarding the best proportion of the weight of wings to weight of structure for the attainment of flight with the least horse-power.\\"Watson, Preston A. Power Necessary in Flight (John Leng & Co. Ltd. Dundee, 1908) Influenced by Frederick William Lanchester's paper titled \\"Aerodynamics\\", constituting the first volume of a complete work on aerial flight published in December 1907, Watson's work contains an analytical approach to aerodynamics, far removed from the outlandish theories he expressed in his first patent. Watson's introduction mentions that he had read Lanchester's work, stating that their findings are similar, but that he arrived at his theories independently. His next patent represented the body of his aeronautical work that he spent the rest of his life researching; his rocking wing concept of lateral control. Applied for on 1 January 1909, the complete specification is dated 23 July 1909 and was left with the Patent Office a day later and accepted on 16 December that year. Patent No.47 of 1909 comprises three pages of descriptions and a single page with an illustration of the rocking wing concept as applied to a theoretical aeroplane. From examining the illustration supplied with the patent and surviving photographs of Watson's aeroplanes, it is plainly evident that he had fully intended on constructing an aircraft based on his patent. Exactly when he completed his first aeroplane is not known, but on page 400 in the 2 November 1909 issue of The Aero magazine is the following statement: Although clearly a typographical error with regards to the location of \\"the secluded little village of Forgendenny, Perthshire, near Preston\\" and Watson's name, this article seems to confirm a likely completion time period of his first full size aeroplane based on his rocking wing patent. Rocking wings Although somewhat neglected by aviation historians, Preston Watson's aeronautical experiments are contemporary with those of better known British pioneers, such as Alliott Verdon Roe and Geoffrey de Havilland. In many ways Watson's experiments are of at least equal historic interest today as those of his contemporaries, since his primary focus was developing an alternative means of controlling an aeroplane in flight - his \\"rocking wing\\" method of lateral control. Watson is known to have built three aeroplanes incorporating rocking wings, only two of which successfully became airborne under their own power. It is likely that Watson's second patent, \\"Improvements in Flying Machines\\" dated 1 January 1909 was the first published description of Watson's rocking wing theory of lateral control, the function of which in a practicable sense is described by him as, \\"above [the main] plane...and carried by the frame of the machine is a rocking aeroplane...capable of rocking about a fore and aft central axle...\\" \\"The pivot...is above the fore and aft central axis of the main plane and depending from the rocking plane and at right angles to it is a lever...fixed rigidly to such rocking plane. This lever is fixed in so far that it can tilt the plane...to one side or the other...\\" The actuation of which by the pilot induces the rocking motion of the wing. When in flight the rocking wing functions in the following manner, \\"when the rocking aeroplane...is tilted out of the horizontal...by moving the lever...to one side, the normal pressure of the rocking aeroplane...is inclined out of the vertical and gives rise to a horizontal component pulling its axle...to one side relative to the line of flight.\\" \\"The [aircraft is] thus caused to rotate about the line of flight, that is to say, the [rocking wing] becomes tilted about the line of flight and out of the horizontal. The normal pressure of the [main plane] is thus inclined out of the vertical and gives rise to a horizontal component pulling the [aircraft] to one side of the line of flight.\\" To climb and descend in the aircraft, the vertically mounted lever, \\"...is moved fore and aft, thus causing the front edge of the rudder [tailplane, none of Watson's aeroplanes were fitted with a vertical rudder. The Wrights also initially referred to their horizontal stabilisers as horizontal rudders] to be moved downwards or upwards.\\" Because of the dual actuation of the control lever, \\"...the [rocking wing] and the [tailplane] can be moved so as to cause the machine to move up and down while at the same time moving to the one side or the other, that is to say that by simply moving the hand which actuates the lever in any desired direction and the trim altered.\\" Watson's declaration as a conclusion to the patent is in two points, as follows: # \\"In aeroplanes the use of a rocking plane situated on a higher level than the main plane, for preserving lateral stability and for steering right and left and controlled by a lever which also operates the horizontal rudder as described and illustrated on the drawings annexed.\\" # \\"In aeroplanes the combination of a fixed main plane with an upper rocking plane as described and for the purposes set forthwith.\\" Despite Watson's firm belief in his system of control, the reality behind it, however ingenious, was that it was no more efficient that wing warping or the use of ailerons in its aerodynamic effect on an aeroplane in flight. Prompted by Charles Gibbs-Smith, when analysed by aerodynamic experts at the Royal Aeronautical Society in the late 1950s, it was found that the rocking wing had a significant disadvantage; it had the effect of a single combined aileron and rudder.Newman, Grant. WW1 Aero – The Journal of the Early Aeroplane No.196, May 2007: Preston Watson's Aeroplanes To execute a banked turn from flying straight and level, the rocking wing worked moderately effectively, but when the aeroplane's lateral equilibrium had been compromised, tipping the rocking wing in the opposite direction to the down-going wing to right itself had a tendency to yaw the aircraft in that direction. In effect, the rocking wing did not fully assist in correcting conditions of instability since the pilot had no means with which to induce or correct a yawing motion. Another possible reason behind the rocking wing idea not progressing beyond Watson's experiments was that it could only be applied to relatively light and small aircraft. Had Preston Watson survived, it is possible that with continual experience flying his aeroplanes he would have thought up an ingenious solution to this problem. Although he would have had to forsake, in his mind, the biggest advantage of his system over contemporaries, the simplicity of operation of the rocking wing method (by a single control lever for pitch and roll), by perhaps adding another actuating device to adequately control his aeroplane. Despite this however, the rocking wing means of lateral control as Watson proposed it, although it had no precedent in aviation's fledgling years, its influence and impact on history have proven to be negligible. Aircraft It is known that Preston Watson constructed three powered aeroplanes, of which only two were able to become airborne under their own power. There have also been claims that Watson also built and flew an unpowered \\"Wright Type\\" glider, but there is little substantial evidence to support this; Preston Watson himself never made the claim and reports of a glider only emerged after James Watson admitted that the claim to powered flight before the Wrights in 1903 was false and the machine Preston flew that year was a glider in the December 1955 issue of Aeronautics magazine. While he might have begun constructing a glider at some stage in his life, no evidence can be found that verifies the claim he flew it. First aeroplane Based on Watson's rocking wing patent, it is assumed that his first powered machine was completed around mid 1909 since it is almost exactly like the illustration that accompanies the patent. Built within the workshops of the Tay Motor Boat and Engine Company of Dundee,The British Newspaper Archive: Dundee Courier, Saturday 9 July 1910: \\"Dundee Aviator Will Compete at Lanark Flying Meeting\\". the Watson No.1 had the upper wing being approximately one half the span of the lower wing. The main wings were in two separate sections, between which the pilot sat. He had no instrumentation of any sort. The upper wing was mounted at the apex of an \\"A\\" frame, with the main wing forming the cross bar of the \\"A\\" and with long skis being fitted at its base. There are rumours that Watson acquired his first aircraft's engine from celebrated Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos Dumont. This was a four-cylinder horizontally opposed engine manufactured in small numbers by Dutheil Chalmers & Cie, Paris, France, of unusual layout; the propeller was mounted between two horizontally opposed banks of cylinders. Despite the fitting of the Dutheil Chalmers engine, Preston Watson's No.1 aeroplane remained firmly earthbound, and he placed it in store in a shed on the property of Mr James Bell at Rossie, Forgandenney, about 25 miles west of Dundee. A year later Watson gave the forlorn craft away to a group of local enthusiasts from the Dundee Model Aero Club, founded in November 1909. David Urquhart, the founder of the Dundee Model Aero Club and two friends, David Robertson and William Gibb, recounted in 1961 how the Dutheil Chalmers motor was removed and the aeroplane was converted into a glider in the club house used by the modellers. By June 1911 the glider had been completed and several flights had been made from a rise on the property of a Mr Geo. Ballingall of Newton, Wormit, in Fife, Scotland. Within five months however, the keen members of the Dundee Model Aero Club were constructing a new glider. What they did with the earlier one is not known; there are some in the Dundee area that believe that it still lies undisturbed in a shed somewhere waiting to be rediscovered. Second aeroplane In his second aeroplane, Preston Watson achieved successful powered flight in a design that appeared to vindicate his theories. Initially hoped to have entered the No.2 in the Lanark Airshow, only the second international air meeting held in the UK, his first flights in it were carried out in the first two weeks of August 1910 at Errol, Perthshire,The British Newspaper Archive: Dundee Courier, Monday 15 August 1910: \\"Dundee Aviator Makes Successful Flight. Aeroplane Trials at Errol\\". having missed out on entering the event owing to a fractured propeller during its very first engine run.The British Newspaper Archive: Dundee Courier, Friday 29 July 1910: \\"Dundee Aviator May Not Compete at Lanark. Aeroplane Propeller Breaks While Being Tested\\". As with his first aeroplane, the No.2 was built by the Tay Motor Boat and Engine Company, in July 1910. The earliest photographs unearthed so far of Watson's No.2 machine in flight are dated from 1912,Flight magazine; 15 May 1914 issue although Watson carried out successful flying trials throughout August and September 1910.The British Newspaper Archive: Dundee Courier, Monday 19 September 1910: \\"Dundee Aviator Has Successful Flights on Machine of Own Invention\\". Constructed from bamboo with its flying surfaces covered in canvas like his first aeroplane, Watson's No.2 was structurally similar to its predecessor, which lends credence to the fact that Watson's first rocking wing aircraft did not fly. The two aircraft shared the same dimensions, wing plan and box kite tail surfaces, although the \\"A\\" frame centre section of the No.2 differed slightly from the No.1 in bracing details. Watson's new aeroplane was powered by a 1910 three cylinder 30 hp Humber engine. A number of accounts state that Preston, his younger brother James and Archie Dickie, who had allegedly gone to Paris to secure a Dutheil Chalmers engine from Alberto Santos-Dumont for Watson's previous aeroplane, all flew the machine at Errol at this time. The pictures published in the 15 May 1914 issue of Flight magazine, which captions the images as having been taken in 1912 have been mis-quoted by James as having been taken in 1908, but the No.2 was built in 1910 and its 30 hp Humber engine was not produced until that year. On being given this piece of rather pointed evidence to the contrary by prominent aviation author Charles Gibbs-Smith, James Watson promptly changed his story. As with his first aeroplane, it is safe to assume that Watson's primary concern about the No.2 would have been its powerplant; above all other considerations, he had to equip it with an engine that was able to get it into the air. Quite probably, his choice of engine was driven by cost and availability. As with his first aeroplane, the fate of the Watson No.2 is unknown, although it was probably scrapped with the outbreak of the Great War. Third aeroplane Probably buoyed by the success of achieving powered flight in one of his own aeroplanes, Watson built a third machine, his last, in 1913. His third aeroplane was deliberately designed to supersede his No.2 in capability, since his theories had been proven in flight. Compared to his previous machines, his No.3 was a different beast, although it still incorporated the same layout with a smaller upper wing, and lacked a definite fuselage. It represented a more professional approach to Watson's aeroplane building, being of considerably smarter appearance than his earlier efforts. It was sturdier, the proliferation of bracing wires were testimony to this. Constructed of metal, possibly steel tubing as opposed to bamboo in his earlier aeroplanes, although James Manson claims the tubing was duralumin. Its wings were of conventional design; the bracing struts were fitted with streamlined aerofoil shaped fairings, made from aluminium or wood and covered in fabric, canvas according to Manson, which was sewn into place by himself. Watson's big No.3 was powered by a British Anzani 45 hp six cylinder two-row radial engine. From 1 January to 1 July 1914, L'Union pour la Sécurité en Aéroplane organisation held the first Concours de La Sécurité en Aéroplanes at Buc aerodrome, near Paris, France in which some 56 aircraft were entered with the intention of displaying advances in safety devices for aeroplanes from a design standpoint. Watson's No.3 was the only British participant, but was disqualified. In the 7 July 1915 issue of The Aeroplane, as an obituary to Watson, the following records one reason why the No.3 might have been ruled out of the competition; \\"Last year Mr Watson took the machine to France and entered it into the 'Concours de La Sécurité', or Security Competition. The machine was not a success, partly no doubt, as Mr Watson claimed, because of its being underpowered. Nevertheless, it did at time get off the ground for short distances.\\" One pilot under Watson's service during the Concours competition was a Mr S. Summerfield of Melton Mowbray. Mr Summerfield recalled that the No.3 handled well once he had gotten used to the novel means of control, but the machine was ruled out of the competition, \\"...for no apparent reason...\\", as recorded in the 3 July 1914 issue of Flight. In the book British Aircraft before the Great War (Schiffer, Atglen, PA 2001), the authors offer the following reason for the No.3's disqualification: \\"...the pilot was classified as a novice and excluded.\\" In March 1915, during an interview with a Flight magazine reporter, Watson mentioned in passing that he had fitted floats to the No.3. It is most likely that they were flotation devices that provided buoyancy in the event of the aircraft ditching during over-water flights. Watson said that he intended on carrying out further experiments with the No.3 after the end of the war, since he had applied for a commission with the Royal Naval Air Service. According to James Manson, Watson's mechanic and sometimes pilot of the No.3, it was broken up around the time of the outbreak of war in 1914, but based on the Flight magazine piece above, Watson retained the machine after he had enrolled into service with the RNAS in 1915. It was likely to have been scrapped after his untimely death. Last year of life The grave of Preston Watson, Western Cemetery, Dundee Nowadays, the efforts of the competitors and judges at the Concours are all-but forgotten, but many of the features pioneered at the event were to resurface on modern aircraft. For Preston Watson, the event proved less than successful, but it illustrated his dedication to his work. One positive consequence of his entry was that his theories became known to a wider audience after the article in Flight magazine that year, where he went into detail about his rocking wing method of control. With the declaration of war in August 1914, Watson hoped to volunteer for service with the Royal Flying Corps - he had held a commission as a volunteer with the Royal Forfarshire Yeomanry, but was refused, being described as too old to fly. In a letter to his wife Beatrice, written presumably in the later months of 1914, published in Alistair W. Blair and Alistair Smith's book The Pioneer Flying Achievements of Preston Watson, Preston explains a meeting with Lithuanian born Leo Anatole Jouques, employed by the War Office to manufacture aeroplanes under licence by his firm Jouques Aviation Works at Willesden and apparently well connected, who suggested to him he might be able to assist him with a commission with the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough. According to letters written by Watson and published in the aforementioned book, he showed Jouques photographs and written details of his rocking wing experiments and aeroplanes, who seemed genuinely interested in the design and claimed he would organise for Watson to give a public demonstration of the machine to the War Office. Evidently this did not take place and Watson was also less-than- enthused by an offer by Jouques to manufacture (presumably) the No.3. Jouques returned to Watson claiming that his wife, who had access to Lord Kitchener and was requesting of him that he gain Watson a commission and that modifications to its undercarriage be made at Jouques' expense before Watson demonstrate the machine to the War Office. Nothing came of any of this, again, presumably because of Watson's own reluctance, as he states in one of the letters that he is \\"swithering\\" over the latest offer by Jouques. One of these letters hints at Watson's own displeasure with his aircraft, although exactly what this might be in regards to is unknown. Was he displeased with his machine's performance at the Concours de La Sécurité en Aéroplanes competition, or was it at the lack of progress with and/or recognition of his experiments as a whole? Not satisfied with progress with the gaining of a flying commission through official sources, Watson endeavoured to earn his own flying qualification by paying for instruction with the London and Provincial School at the London Aerodrome, Hendon. By the end of December 1914, he had gone solo, having carried out his training in the L & P Biplane; an indigenous aeroplane built by L & P School instructors resembling a Caudron G.3. On 16 March 1915, Watson was awarded his Royal Aero Club Certificate, No.1,117, the equivalent of achieving a pilot's licence in the L & P Biplane, having achieved it \\"...in excellent style\\" according to an entry in the 24 March 1915 issue of The Aeroplane. At the bottom of page 145 in the 26 February 1915 issue of Flight is a photograph of students and instructors of the London and Provincial School; Watson can be seen wearing a leather flying cap standing next to a sheepish looking Clive Collett, later Capt. Clive Franklin Collett MC, Great War fighter ace from Spring Creek near Blenheim, New Zealand and the first member of the Royal Flying Corps to parachute out of an aeroplane. In late March however, despite already possessing his certificate with the L & P School, Watson enrolled for flying training with the Beatty School at Hendon and commenced what is listed as \\"extra practice\\" in the 31 March 1915 issue of The Aeroplane magazine, flying that school's Beatty-Wright biplane. On 30 June 1915, Flight sub-Lieutenant Preston Watson of the Royal Naval Air Service was flying Caudron G.3 3266 between Eastchurch in Kent and Eastbourne, East Sussex, England when his aeroplane \\"suddenly dived from a great height to the ground\\", and crashed in Dunlye Field, a few miles from the Cross-in-Hand Hotel near Heathfield. Watson was killed in the accident. He was 34 years old. Preston Watson is interred in the Western Cemetery, Dundee.Western Cemetery, Dundee, People of historical interest The grave lies just before the first upper terrace. The white obelisk bears a dove in flight. What actually happened to cause the Caudron to crash has never been fully explained; some hypothesised that the aircraft suffered structural failure, since a wing was found in an adjoining field. Engine failure was also suggested as a possible cause of the crash. Watson's RNAS casualty card offers no clues, merely stating the time and place he was killed. Buried on 5 July 1915 in Dundee's Western Cemetery, he was survived by a widow and two young children. What became of his aeroplanes and his research is not known. Powered-flight- before-the-Wrights claims Preston Watson's achievements, although not spectacular are today regarded with scepticism because of the erroneous claims of powered-flight-before-the-Wrights in the summer of 1903 that originated from his younger brother James. According to Alistair W. Blair and Alistair Smith in The Pioneer Flying Achievements of Preston Watson, James Watson began collating information on the claim in a letter to the Science Museum, London dated 21 October 1949. In the 15 December 1953 issue of the Manchester Guardian newspaper, James had an article published referencing the claim, although it wasn't the first public acknowledgement of it. Following this, James Watson approached the Royal Aeronautical Society via a joint dinner with the Royal Aero Club at the Dorchester Hotel, London, commemorating 50 years since the Wright Brothers' first powered flight on 17 December 1903, with evidence, including photographs and eye-witness accounts that Preston Watson flew a powered aeroplane before the Wright Brothers. A further article appeared in the February 1954 issue of Aeronautics magazine titled \\"The Watson History\\", in which James Watson re-iterated his claim, although the magazine's editor cautiously advised readers that; \\"we would say that we are not convinced that Preston Watson can upset existing priority claims for controlled and sustained flight.\\" Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum and professional aviation researcher Charles Gibbs-Smith vigorously investigated the Watson claim. The presentation of Gibbs-Smith's findings to him eventually forced a change of tack from Watson the Younger. Published in the December 1955 issue of Aeronautics magazine titled \\"A pioneer in Scotland\\", James changed his story from that published in the same magazine previously, stating that \\"Preston's first aeroplane was without an engine\\" and that \\"trial flights were made at Errol in the summer of 1903\\". In a letter to Gibbs-Smith, James also wrote, \\"I make no claim that the 'machine' Preston used at Errol in 1903 was a powered machine.\\" The Wright Type glider This \\"confession\\" gave rise to rumours that Preston had built a \\"Wright Type glider\\" at that time, although no such claim had appeared before. A so-called reliable source was found in a close friend of the Watson family, former head of Kings College Dental Department, dental surgeon John Bell Milne, who claimed to have seen Preston's earliest flying machine, but had not witnessed it in flight. In correspondence with Gibbs-Smith, Bell Milne later described the aircraft as, \\"...definitely a glider, it had skids. It was of normal biplane build, both wings in the same span. It had an elevator out front.\\" In an interview he gave in 1961, Milne remembered that Watson constructed his glider in, \\"...late 1903 or early 1904\\", at the time he and Preston, \\"...were attending physics classes at University College [Dundee].\\" Peculiarly, in a letter to Gibbs-Smith dated 15 August 1957, James Watson discredits Bell Milne's testimony above, advising that because he was not present in 1903, he could not have seen the machine that he and Preston were testing was a rocking-wing aeroplane, criticising the fact that Bell Milne saw a biplane glider that had a front-mounted elevator. Owing to himself claiming that Preston had flown an unpowered aircraft that year in Aeronautics magazine two years earlier and in the later letter to Gibbs-Smith, one wonders whether James was aware of the discrepancies in his own testimonies, as one by one his claims were disproved. What makes the assertion that Preston Watson built a glider, or any aircraft in 1903 questionable is that James Watson publicly contradicts himself on more than one occasion. Only after being pressured by Gibbs-Smith after first making his claims in 1953 did James Watson admit that the aircraft Preston flew in 1903 was a glider. Prior to this admission, there was never any mention of a Watson built glider, neither by James, the eyewitnesses James presented in support of his original claim, nor significantly, by Preston Watson himself. Exactly when Preston Watson carried out his first flights in this aircraft is the crux of the matter in the eyes of James Watson's supporters. For any claimant to powered flight earlier than the Wrights, the date of the Wright's first powered flight (17 December 1903) is when such flights must pre-date. It is therefore convenient for anyone recalling such an event some fifty years after it allegedly took place to quote the year as 1903 or earlier. It is also notable that none of the eye witnesses that James Watson interviewed whilst preparing his case for Watson's powered flights ever mentioned that they saw a glider flying at Errol; all of them saw a powered aeroplane. Only in Bell Milne was there a recollection of a Watson glider and even then, he never saw it being flown. Debated claims At the inquest into Preston's untimely death on 30 June 1915, his father stated that his son, \\"...had taken a great interest in flying for the past seven years\\", suggesting that the year in which he was aware that Preston begun his fascination with flight was 1908, the year in which Wilbur Wright first flew in Europe and news of the Wright Brother's exploits became available to the public at large. Evidently however, he had demonstrated an interest in aviation before 1908, based on the fact that he had published a patent for flying machines a year earlier, but examining these draws the conclusion that his ideas at that time were way off the mark when it came to an understanding of what constituted a successful aircraft. Although Watson applied for a patent for flying machines in late 1907 however, had an aircraft been built that incorporated his ideas, with all the will in the world it never would have left the ground. This is another fact that flies in the face of a Watson built flying machine of any sort in 1903. Why would he produce such naïve work if his prior research into methods of achieving flight had been successful? Another cause for debate is the claim that Preston Watson approached celebrated Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont in 1906 and purchased from him a Dutheil Chalmers engine. In 1955, John Bell Milne made a personal assertion to Charles Gibbs-Smith that the year the motor was purchased was 1906. This could not have been possible, since Dutheil Chalmers & Cie did not construct their first aero-engine until 1907. In a later interview Bell Milne changed the date to a year later, thus bringing into question his earlier statements' validity. Photographs show a Dutheil Chalmers motor fitted to Watson's first rocking wing aircraft, but Gibbs-Smith later presented these to M. Charles Dolfuss, Director of the Musee de L'Air at Le Bourget, Paris who confirmed it as a 1908 or 1909 four cylinder 40 hp Dutheil Chalmers motor. If Watson acquired the Dutheil Chalmers engine from Santos-Dumont, the earliest date the purchase could have taken place was 1908. A further false statement made by James Watson was that Preston had the No. 3 shipped to France and entered into a competition, in which it won a safety award. No evidence of this can be found anywhere. The only competition in France Preston entered any of his aeroplanes in was the Concours de La Sécurité en Aéroplanes, in which his No.3 aeroplane was disqualified. Some sources quote the date in which Watson's No.3 won the safety prize was 1913, but the Concours held between 1 January and 1 July 1914 was the first of its kind. Eyewitnesses As with most claims of powered-flight-before-the- Wrights, the only supporting evidence James Watson produced was that of eyewitnesses. Like other claimants, the eyewitness accounts Watson supplied are inconsistent with one another and were made at least fifty years after the alleged events took place. In this respect the Watson case draws parallels with that of New Zealander Richard Pearse. In a letter dated 19 December 1959 to one G. Bolt Esq., after he had submitted information about Richard Pearse to Charles Gibbs-Smith, the latter advises Bolt to be wary of eyewitness claims. With regards to the Watson case, he states that after the story and photographs were published in 1953: It is worth remembering that in the 15 May 1914 issue of Flight magazine, Preston Watson himself stated that, in his own words, \\"these gentlemen, the Wrights, were the first to fly in a practical way\\", and at no time during his life did he ever contradict that statement. By contrast, James' and others' testimonies to the dubious claims of Preston's powered-flight-before-the-Wrights are riddled with inconsistencies, changes of facts and general errors. Bearing this in mind, it is difficult to refute Preston's own words on the matter. Confirmation from articles in the Dundee Courier in 1910 confirming completion dates of Watson's first and second aeroplanes pour cold water on the suggestion that he built and flew rocking wing aircraft any earlier. Yet the rumours persist, with no small thanks to the likes of the book The Pioneer Flying Achievements of Preston Watson, which is full of inconsistencies and errors and relies primarily on James Watson's discredited testimony. The unearthing of factual accounts of Watson's activities has not prevented a flood of articles and further re-assertions of the discredited stories in newspapers and magazines since James made his assertions over 60 years ago, however. During the 100th anniversary year of the Wrights' first powered flights, reporters took up the story and published \\"their\\" exclusive in the local press, recycling the same James Watson quotes and statements between them. Facts about Preston Watson remain as obscure to the public today as before December 1953, and although James Watson later publicly denied the claims he made about his brother, there are still many who refuse to accept that his tale has been so comprehensively debunked. Family He was married to Beatrice Philip (1882–1971). Their son Ronald Watson (1908–1941) was killed at sea whilst serving as a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve.Grave of Preston Watson and family, Western Cemetery, Dundee See also *Aircraft flight control system *Clive Franklyn Collett *Charles Gibbs-Smith *List of aviation pioneers *Richard Pearse *Alberto Santos Dumont *Wing warping *The Wright Brothers References Category:1880 births Category:1915 deaths Category:People educated at the High School of Dundee Category:Aviation inventors Category:Aviation pioneers Category:Alumni of the University of Dundee Category:People from Dundee Category:Engineers from Dundee Category:Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in England ","title":"Preston Watson"},{"id":"10095073","text":"Site-specific recombination, also known as conservative site-specific recombination, is a type of genetic recombination in which DNA strand exchange takes place between segments possessing at least a certain degree of sequence homology. Enzymes known as site-specific recombinases (SSRs) perform rearrangements of DNA segments by recognizing and binding to short, specific DNA sequences (sites), at which they cleave the DNA backbone, exchange the two DNA helices involved, and rejoin the DNA strands. In some cases the presence of a recombinase enzyme and the recombination sites is sufficient for the reaction to proceed; in other systems a number of accessory proteins and/or accessory sites are required. Many different genome modification strategies, among these recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE), an advanced approach for the targeted introduction of transcription units into predetermined genomic loci, rely on SSRs. Site-specific recombination systems are highly specific, fast, and efficient, even when faced with complex eukaryotic genomes. They are employed naturally in a variety of cellular processes, including bacterial genome replication, differentiation and pathogenesis, and movement of mobile genetic elements.Nash, H. A. (1996). Site-specific recombination: integration, excision, resolution, and inversion of defined DNA segments. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: cellular and molecular biology, 2, pp. 2363–2376. For the same reasons, they present a potential basis for the development of genetic engineering tools. Recombination sites are typically between 30 and 200 nucleotides in length and consist of two motifs with a partial inverted-repeat symmetry, to which the recombinase binds, and which flank a central crossover sequence at which the recombination takes place. The pairs of sites between which the recombination occurs are usually identical, but there are exceptions (e.g. attP and attB of λ integrase). Classification: tyrosine- vs. serine- recombinases Fig. 1. Tyr-Recombinases: Details of the crossover step. Top: Traditional view including strand-exchange followed by branch-migration (proofreading). The mechanism occurs in the framework of a synaptic complex (1) including both DNA sites in parallel orientation. While branch-migration explains the specific homology requirements and the reversibility of the process in a straightforward manner, it cannot be reconciled with the motions recombinase subunits have to undergo in three dimensions. Bottom: Current view. Two simultaneous strand-swaps, each depending on the complementarity of three successive bases at (or close to) the edges of the 8-bp spacer (dashed lines indicate base-pairing). Didactic complications arise from the fact that, in this model, the synaptic complex must accommodate both substrates in an anti-parallel orientation. This synaptic complex (1) arises from the association of two individual recombinase subunits (\\"protomers\\"; gray ovals) with the respective target site. Its formation depends on inter-protomer contacts and DNA bending, which in turn define the subunits (green) with an active role during the first crossover reaction. Both representations illustrate only one half of the respective pathway. These parts are separated by a Holliday junction/isomerization step before the product (3) can be released. (attL and attR). This explains the irreversible nature of this particular recombination pathway, which can only be overcome by auxiliary \\"recombination directionality factors\\" (RDFs). Based on amino acid sequence homologies and mechanistic relatedness, most site-specific recombinases are grouped into one of two families: the tyrosine (Tyr) recombinase family or serine (Ser) recombinase family. The names stem from the conserved nucleophilic amino acid residue present in each class of recombinase which is used to attack the DNA and which becomes covalently linked to it during strand exchange. The earliest identified members of the serine recombinase family were known as resolvases or DNA invertases, while the founding member of the tyrosine recombinases, lambda phage integrase (using attP/B recognition sites), differs from the now well-known enzymes such as Cre (from the P1 phage) and FLP (from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Famous serine recombinases include enzymes such as gamma-delta resolvase (from the Tn1000 transposon), Tn3 resolvase (from the Tn3 transposon), and φC31 integrase (from the φC31 phage). Although the individual members of the two recombinase families can perform reactions with the same practical outcomes, the families are unrelated to each other, having different protein structures and reaction mechanisms. Unlike tyrosine recombinases, serine recombinases are highly modular, as was first hinted by biochemical studies and later shown by crystallographic structures. Knowledge of these protein structures could prove useful when attempting to re-engineer recombinase proteins as tools for genetic manipulation. Mechanism Recombination between two DNA sites begins by the recognition and binding of these sites – one site on each of two separate double-stranded DNA molecules, or at least two distant segments of the same molecule – by the recombinase enzyme. This is followed by synapsis, i.e. bringing the sites together to form the synaptic complex. It is within this synaptic complex that the strand exchange takes place, as the DNA is cleaved and rejoined by controlled transesterification reactions. During strand exchange, each double-stranded DNA molecule is cut at a fixed point within the crossover region of the recognition site, releasing a deoxyribose hydroxyl group, while the recombinase enzyme forms a transient covalent bond to a DNA backbone phosphate. This phosphodiester bond between the hydroxyl group of the nucleophilic serine or tyrosine residue conserves the energy that was expended in cleaving the DNA. Energy stored in this bond is subsequently used for the rejoining of the DNA to the corresponding deoxyribose hydroxyl group on the other DNA molecule. The entire reaction therefore proceeds without the need for external energy-rich cofactors such as ATP. Although the basic chemical reaction is the same for both tyrosine and serine recombinases, there are some differences between them. Tyrosine recombinases, such as Cre or FLP, cleave one DNA strand at a time at points that are staggered by 6–8bp, linking the 3’ end of the strand to the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine nucleophile (Fig. 1). Strand exchange then proceeds via a crossed strand intermediate analogous to the Holliday junction in which only one pair of strands has been exchanged. The mechanism and control of serine recombinases is much less well understood. This group of enzymes was only discovered in the mid-1990s and is still relatively small. The now classical members gamma-delta and Tn3 resolvase, but also new additions like φC31-, Bxb1-, and R4 integrases, cut all four DNA strands simultaneously at points that are staggered by 2 bp (Fig. 2). During cleavage, a protein–DNA bond is formed via a transesterification reaction, in which a phosphodiester bond is replaced by a phosphoserine bond between a 5’ phosphate at the cleavage site and the hydroxyl group of the conserved serine residue (S10 in resolvase). Fig. 3A. Reversible insertion and excision by the Cre-lox system. Fig. 3B. Inversion by the Cre-lox system. It is still not entirely clear how the strand exchange occurs after the DNA has been cleaved. However, it has been shown that the strands are exchanged while covalently linked to the protein, with a resulting net rotation of 180°. The most quoted (but not the only) model accounting for these facts is the \\"subunit rotation model\\" (Fig. 2). Independent of the model, DNA duplexes are situated outside of the protein complex, and large movement of the protein is needed to achieve the strand exchange. In this case the recombination sites are slightly asymmetric, which allows the enzyme to tell apart the left and right ends of the site. When generating products, left ends are always joined to the right ends of their partner sites, and vice versa. This causes different recombination hybrid sites to be reconstituted in the recombination products. Joining of left ends to left or right to right is avoided due to the asymmetric “overlap” sequence between the staggered points of top and bottom strand exchange, which is in stark contrast to the mechanism employed by tyrosine recombinases. The reaction catalysed by Cre-recombinase, for instance, may lead to excision of the DNA segment flanked by the two sites (Fig. 3A), but may also lead to integration or inversion of the orientation of the flanked DNA segment (Fig. 3B). What the outcome of the reaction will be is dictated mainly by the relative locations and orientations of the sites that are to be recombined, but also by the innate specificity of the site-specific system in question. Excisions and inversions occur if the recombination takes place between two sites that are found on the same molecule (intramolecular recombination), and if the sites are in the same (direct repeat) or in an opposite orientation (inverted repeat), respectively. Insertions, on the other hand, take place if the recombination occurs on sites that are situated on two different DNA molecules (intermolecular recombination), provided that at least one of these molecules is circular. Most site-specific systems are highly specialised, catalysing only one of these different types of reaction, and have evolved to ignore the sites that are in the \\"wrong\\" orientation.

She was played by Zoe Henry, making her first appearance on 16 March 2007. K.C. was one of the women Claire Peacock met through her voluntary phone counselling; she had lost her baby. Her character has noted to the police that her nickname is K.C. not Casey, using the first letter in her first name and second name respectively. Storylines On 1 April 2007, Claire left her new friend KC babysitting her son, Freddie, while she went out. When she returned, Freddie and KC had gone so she panicked and called the police, worried that KC had kidnapped him. She was worried as she had met KC through her work on the phone lines of a support group for women that had miscarriages. However, KC explained that she had taken Freddie out for a drive as he wouldn't settle but was upset that Claire had called the police and left just as they arrived. However in June, KC was seen stalking Claire, and was thought to be responsible for the fire at 4 Coronation Street. When her photograph appeared in the Weatherfield Gazette and on the news, she went to the police and was released without charge and then confronted Claire. KC and Claire Peacock resumed their friendship and KC showed an interest in Claire's husband, Ashley, after Claire said she was worried that her marriage was in trouble. On 30 July, KC made her move on Ashley and they were about to sleep together but Claire came home early. Audrey Roberts (a friend of Ashley's late father) was concerned about Ashley and Claire's marriage and saw KC taking Claire's place with Ashley and Josh, while Claire was away (on KC’s advice). Audrey confronted Ashley, who admitted that he was having an affair with KC as Claire didn't seem to realize his needs. Ashley told KC that Audrey knew about their affair and KC confronted Audrey, warning her to stay away but Audrey told her that she was just a fling that Ashley would get over. However, KC stressed that she and Ashley were a proper couple and claimed that they had been having an affair for months. Audrey told KC she'd betrayed Claire as a friend and that the affair was her way to get revenge. KC responded by implying that she, Ashley and Josh would soon be a proper family and neither Audrey or Claire would be able to prevent it. Later, Audrey persuaded Claire to come home and Ashley ended his affair with KC, convinced that Ashley secretly loved her. Claire was shocked to learn that KC had been visiting regularly, helping out with Josh and cooking Ashley dinner and even sleeping there. Claire was suspicious so she and Ashley told KC to leave. Claire asked Ashley if he was sleeping with KC but he denied it. KC confronted Audrey and told her that she pushed Ashley to break Claire's heart and reveal that they were an item. Later, Claire invited KC to lunch and Ashley told her to stop stalking him. KC relished telling Ashley that she's not going anywhere and continued to stalk Ashley for some time. One day she spotted an opportunity to get his attention when he left Freddie with Kirk Sutherland. KC grabbed it, telling Kirk that Ashley had asked her to pick up Freddie and asking Ashley to phone her. She then told Audrey that she and Ashley were a couple and will be getting married. Ashley was horrified to learn that KC had kidnapped Freddie so he phoned her and went to her flat, insisting Kirk keep this from Claire. Audrey, however, told Claire about KC’s behaviour and Kirk told her that KC had taken Freddie so she and Audrey rushed to KC’s flat after calling the police. Ashley was horrified to see Casey's walls covered with photos of him and saw KC on the balcony, holding Freddie. She admitted starting the fire, explaining that she felt Claire was in the way. Ashley, realizing just how ill his \\"mistress\\" was, tried convincing her that her feelings for him weren't real. KC, shocked by Ashley's words, moved closer to the edge of the balcony with Freddie, saying if Ashley didn't love her then she and Freddie might as well be dead. Claire saw this and KC forced Ashley to tell Claire the truth about their affair and had slept together whilst she was at her support group. Claire was silent so KC demanded Ashley propose to her; worried about Freddie, Ashley did so. KC was elated but Claire challenged her. She reminded KC of what she had said about the death of her baby, a boy she named Rhys, and all her hopes for him and how she imagined how her baby would grow up. KC, now irritated, ran toward Claire to make her stop talking and Claire took Freddie. She tried to jump from the balcony but Ashley stopped her just as the police burst in and took an hysterical KC away. In a later episode, the policeman in charge of KC’s case, visited the Peacocks and told Ashley and Claire that KC was mentally unfit to stand trial. She would be sectioned under the Mental Health Act indefinitely as she was a serious danger to other people. Reception The plot in which featured KC threatening Freddie, was speculated as being similar to an episode of Tonight with Trevor McDonald. Tragedy mum Natasha Hogan was interviewed to support this. Zoe Henry revealed that her husband, Jeff Hordley, who plays Cain Dingle in Emmerdale, had given her advice on playing a villainous role. Interviews Zoe provided the Sunday Mirror: Following the characters departure, Henry had a guest part in The Bill. before taking on the full-time role of Rhona Goskirk in rival soap, Emmerdale.

The episode combined the elements of Top Gear, with that of BBC music chart show Top of the Pops, the latter of which was cancelled by the BBC in 2006. In the episode, presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May hosted their own version of the chart show in their studio at Dunsfold, including discussions about music-related news topics, and performed as a band for the final number alongside Justin Hawkins; although it was mentioned, the 'Cool Wall' did not feature in the episode's broadcast. The programme was produced as a replacement for A Question of Comedy, a one-off special edition of sports quiz A Question of Sport that had been recorded some months earlier for Comic Relief but was withdrawn due to Jade Goody being involved as one of its contestants. The decision came after it was felt to be inappropriate to show it following the racism controversy that emerged after her participation on Celebrity Big Brother 5. Performances * Lethal Bizzle - \\"Mr.\\" : The performance was deliberately cut short by Clarkson who literally pulled the plug on him, before labelling it as 'just noise' and referring to him as \\"Jizzy Tissue\\" throughout the rest of the show. * Travis - \\"Closer\\" : The band performed three times during filming to make sure everything was perfect, and was incident-free, with the song the only one to be taken seriously and Clarkson declaring it should be the \\"kind of thing that should be on TOTP\\". * Supergrass and Adrian Edmondson - \\"Richard III\\" : The band were assisted on guitar by comedian Adrian Edmondson, but had to put up with the hosts supplying bizarre \\"special effects\\" to \\"glam\\" up the song; Clarkson administered excessive dry ice artificial fog, May threw live 'Bonnie Tyler doves' (chickens) in front of and on the stage, and Hammond used a wind machine for to finish things. The strong winds from the machine cause Edmondson to be blown off his feet and nearly to fall off the stage. Note: The hosts pointed out that Danny Goffey's father, Chris Goffey, used to present the show. * McFly - \\"Sofa Hyundai Administration (Top Gear Blues)\\" : As part of a challenge set by the hosts, the band were challenged by the hosts to write a song which had to contains the words \\"Sofa\\", \\"Administration\\" and \\"Hyundai\\" but could not include \\"Love\\", \\"Baby\\" and \\"Heart\\", and then perform what they wrote. The song was written during production of the episode, and was performed towards the end of the show, using a basic 12-bar blues pattern. Note: The song produced by the band was included on their single \\"The Heart Never Lies\\", following the broadcast of the special. * Justin Hawkins - \\"Red Light Spells Danger\\" : The hosts performed as the \\"Top Gear band\\" Despite none of the presenters being professional musicians; all three have musical talent - May has a degree in music, and is a pianist and flautist, while Hammond and Clarkson play bass and drums respectively. The band consisted of May on keyboard, Hammond on bass guitar, and Clarkson drums, with additional support from a backing guitarist, a keyboard player and three backing vocalists, with the band accompanying The Darkness front man Justin Hawkins, who had been on Top Gear as a guest and who sung the song to close the episode out. Criticism A number of complaints were made by viewers, directed towards James May's actions during Supergrass' performance in which he threw live birds. Viewers were concerned in their complaints, that the welfare of the birds had not been considered by the show. Reception In an article of The Guardian that covered the reception of Red Nose Day 2007 with viewers, Top Gear of the Pops obtained viewing figures of for 6.1 million its timeslot of 22:00-22:30. The figures made it the most watched show of its timeslot, with it attracting a 28% audience share.

She appears in all of the first four series, as well as the seventh series, and appears in the most episodes (27). Kaya Scodelario was included in Entertainment Weeklys 2009 \\"Summer Must List\\", being named \\"Bad Girl\\" for her portrayal of Effy. She was included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Characterisation Scodelario and Nicholas Hoult, Skins party 2007 Effy is Tony Stonem's runaway sister and one of the few people he truly cares about. She usually goes to social events with her own group of friends, leaving Tony uninvolved in most of her social life, though he helped her on more than one occasion to deceive their parents as to her whereabouts. The official website refers to \\"Tony's little sister and her shadowy ways.\\" Until the first season's eighth episode, \\"\\"Effy\\",\\" she does not speak at all, instead sitting silently in the background of the scenes in which she appears, usually with a cold stare or a wry smile (a trademark of hers). In her first speaking appearance, she describes how she feels toward others: Tony sarcastically comments that she is participating in a sponsored silence, and when asked by Michelle why she never speaks, she simply doesn't answer. On her blog she reveals that her parents had her see a counselor for withholding speech, but that proved ineffective. After Tony's life-threatening accident in the finale of the first series, Effy begins speaking again. After expressing her feelings of misanthropy to Tony, however, her brother snidely remarks to her that she \\"doesn't fool [him]\\", suggesting that she is more vulnerable than her guarded and apparent aloofness may lead others to believe. She also proves to be perceptive and sly, as she almost single-handedly mends both Tony and Michelle's and Sid and Cassie's romantic relationships, a task that seemed essentially hopeless. In the third series Effy became a central character, developing into something of a femme fatale and the rebel of Roundview College. Despite her usual composure, she goes \\"off the rails\\" after her parents' separation and the love triangle between her and her classmates Freddie McClair and James Cook, once close friends before their rivalry over Effy pushed them apart. Of the two, she loves Freddie more, but she is afraid of dealing with real love, so she instead goes after Cook. Her mother, Anthea Stonem, justifies Effy's behavior to JJ Jones by saying that \\"showing her cards scares her to death\\". Effy's state is also exacerbated by Tony's absence, as he had proved to be a stabilizing force in her life, as also shown in a blog entry by Effy posted on the official Skins website. In her eponymous episode in season three, Effy is depicted at her most fragile: she appears completely withdrawn from the world, participates in mindless sex with Cook and takes uncharacteristically little care with her appearance, appearing tired and fatigued. These factors hint at the development of Effy's depression, which will descend into full-blown psychosis in the next series. In the fourth series, she returns to Bristol after being away in Venice for the summer. She and Freddie begin their relationship again deciding that she loves him, thus letting go of Cook for good. She begins to have psychotic episodes and delusional symptoms and Freddie realizes that Effy has developed psychotic depression. She attempts suicide but Freddie, foreseeing this, saves her and she is taken to hospital and later, institutionalized. Anthea tells Freddie that they both need to be there to rebuild Effy, but Freddie tells her that only she will be there for her, seemingly letting go of Effy. Though they reconcile, when she leaves treatment in her centric episode, it is shown she is being abused by her obsessive psychiatrist and his unconventional hypnotic methods for treating her; Dr. Foster attempts to make Effy \\"forget\\" her friends. At the site of Tony's accident, Effy suffers another breakdown and, in traffic, attempts suicide once again. When Freddie confronts Dr. Foster about Effy's treatment, the doctor kills him. In the finale of season four, Effy is once again out of treatment, and even following Freddie's mysterious disappearance is secure in that he loved her. Effy is one of few characters in the series who have broken the fourth wall, looking straight at the camera and commenting or smirking in some episodes; another person to do this (and probably the most obvious) was Rich (Generation 3) in Series 6 episode 10 \\"Everyone (finale)\\", looking straight at the camera, saying the word \\"bye\\", signifying the end of Skins in its entirety, aside from Series 7 being a 6 episode redux. On her official Skins page, Effy claims she is distantly related to the 18th-century French aristocrat Cecile DeLacroix, who was beheaded during the French Revolution. She also says her favorite smell is petrol, and describes a peculiar talent of being able to pick up objects with her toes. Her favorite film is E.T.. Her best friend is odd girl Pandora Moon, who despite their differences, \\"gives the detached and cool Effy a heart\\". Character history Effy was born in 1992 to parents Anthea (Morwenna Banks) and Jim Stonem (Harry Enfield). Series 1 In \\"Tony\\", Effy is seen one morning briefly walking home at the beginning of the episode, apparently from partying the night before. Her brother Tony distracts her father so that she can sneak back into the house, a routine they are both clearly familiar with. In \\"Effy\\", Tony is forced to care about someone other than himself for once when Effy – one of the only people he cares about – disappears during a night of partying with a boy named Spencer (played by Tom Payne). After taking various drugs, Spencer leads Effy to a party, where Josh Stock injects her with stolen clean pharmaceuticals. When Effy overdoses, Josh tells Tony that he will only let him take her to the hospital if Tony has sex with his unconscious sister, which Josh demands in revenge for Tony scheming against his relationship with Michelle. After Tony begs for forgiveness, Josh lets them go, and Tony rushes to the hospital with Effy and Sid Jenkins, where Effy is told that she will be fine. During this episode Effy shows some tendencies similar to an arsonist, setting certain objects alight with her cigarette lighter. In the series finale, we learn that Effy's parents have moved her to the private school in the aftermath of her drug episode. More layers to her character appear as she derides Tony verbally as a wanker for his treatment of ex-girlfriend Michelle, who had come to her previously in an attempt to understand Tony. She witnesses as Tony is hit by a bus, and screams in horror, crying silently as the finale takes place. Series 2 In the second series, we learn that Effy has now begun to speak openly, at least amongst her family and presumably among others as well. She also continues to party, as seen in the first episode of the second series, despite the events of \\"Effy\\" last series where both she and Tony were put through a traumatic experience. In the sixth episode \\"Tony\\", it becomes clear that she is looking after Tony since his accident, where she is seen comforting him from his nightmares by reading him Greek myths. She also speaks to Michelle and Sid, but is fairly unfriendly with both of them. In this series' Effy-centric episode, it is revealed that Effy and Tony's father is on a business trip in France while their mother stays at home each day, depressed and taking Tony's medication. Effy on the other hand has taken on the role of a parental figure somewhat, where she is seen washing and drying her and Tony's clothes (albeit ineptly), and watching after her mother. At school Effy's art teacher appoints Effy to the task of helping new girl Pandora, and explains that she must do well on her GCSE Art coursework or else she'll be expelled. Although Effy clearly objects to the former, she allows Pandora to follow her around, and even takes her home with her. Back at home Tony receives a parcel from Michelle, which is actually the watch he gave her for her birthday, prompting him to become further frustrated with Sid. Sid explains to Effy his problems, in which she agrees that in exchange for doing her GCSE Art coursework, she will sort out Sid's struggling social enterprises; specifically concerning his love for the estranged Cassie Ainsworth. Effy, with Pandora in tow, picks up weed at Cassie's where she inquires about her relationship with Sid, but otherwise doesn't probe the subject. Effy is later seen taking the drugs to a club, where she sells them and is also seen by Tony selling Michelle's watch, prompting him to be angered with her. It is revealed later that Effy didn't sell it, but instead had it repaired and sent back to Michelle with the word \\"forever\\" engraved in it, softening Michelle enough to speak to Tony again. As for Sid, Effy sends an acquaintance of hers called Jake to Cassie's – knowing the chances that they would sleep together – and takes a series of photos through the window. She scatters the photos around Sid's sleeping form, prompting him to finally confront Cassie, where the two subsequently make up. At school, Effy doesn't use Sid's artwork he created for her (she lets Pandora use it), but explains to her teacher that her GCSE Art coursework is conceptual, in which she used an array of emotions – referring to her recent experiences helping others mend their relationships. At the end of the episode, Effy's father arrives home to a clean house, and his wife in an elegant state, all presumably done by Effy. In the finale of the second series, \\"Final Goodbyes\\", Effy is seen in the final shot before the credits, smirking at the camera and smiling while lying under Tony's duvet cover, foreshadowing her presence as the lead character in the third series. Series 3 In the first episode of the series, Effy catches the eye of best friends Freddie, Cook and JJ on her first day at Roundview College. When Freddie attempts to engage in conversation with Effy, flirtatiously suggesting possibly more than a friendship, she warns him that his best friends Cook and JJ want the same, which will likely complicate things. However, after his insistence, she then proposes a challenge by giving him a list of all the things they're not supposed to do in school — such as sniffing glue, smoking weed, arson, porn, and sex in school — and says whoever completes the list first will get an opportunity to \\"get to know\\" her. By the end of the day Cook is the only one to have completed Effy's challenge, with the exceptions of sex and drugs in school. Effy excuses herself from class, prompting Cook to follow, where they light up a spliff and the two have sex in the school nurse's office. In the following episode, \\"Cook\\", Effy gets to know her new classmates better while celebrating Cook's birthday, and in the third episode \\"Thomas\\", her suspicion that her mother is having an affair is confirmed when she catches her post-coitus with her father's boss. In the following episode \\"Pandora\\", her father leaves her and her mother, so Effy copes by getting trashed at Pandora's girls-only pajama party, despite Pandora's earlier rules that drinking, drugs, and boys would not be tolerated. When Effy returns the next morning, presumably to apologise or comfort Pandora for her actions, she discovers that Pandora and Cook slept together. Though Effy immediately confronts her, Pandora uses the opportunity to stand up for herself and tells Effy she does not put enough effort into their friendship (she has, thus far, demonstrated herself to be somewhat selfish), for which Effy does not argue. In \\"Freddie\\", Effy rebuffs Freddie's suggestion that they'd \\"be good together\\" by claiming that she would merely break his heart. Later, Freddie expresses his feelings to her in greater depth where the two share a passionate kiss, however Effy returns to Cook. In \\"Naomi\\", although there is apparent tension between Effy and Freddie, she and Pandora seem to be on better terms with one another. In \\"JJ\\", JJ, Freddie and Cook's mutual friend, who has been encouraged by Emily, angrily confronts Effy for her part in destroying the once-strong friendship he, Freddie and Cook shared. Effy, seeing the impact she had had, is apologetic and, although she cannot guarantee that she will stop, she expresses sentiment that she would like to become his friend after he admits that he loves her too, and is somewhat hurt when he refuses. Naomi later points out that Effy is in love with Freddie, although Effy feebly denies it. In her central episode it is apparent that Effy has \\"gone off the rails\\" as stated by her in the previous episode. Though she is prepared to break up with Cook — which she does without informing him — and confront Freddie with her feelings, she is discouraged by Freddie's new relationship with Katie. When the group goes camping in an area of the woods known as Gobblers End, the uninvited Cook shows up and bitterly reveals secrets, including that he and Pandora have apparently been sleeping together behind Effy's back. Under the influence of shrooms, Effy flees from the clearing where they are camping and into the woods where she is attacked by a jealous and insecure Katie, who pins her down and spits on her before attempting to choke her, prompting Effy to pick up a rock and strike Katie in self-defense. Afterward, Effy is comforted when she and Freddie have sex for the first time, however the next morning when Katie is learned to be missing, Effy becomes extremely anxious. Eventually, Katie is found after a phone call Effy makes and is taken to the hospital, where Freddie and others learn what happened and turn against Effy for abandoning Katie in the woods and for causing her to need nine stitches in her head. Effy blacks out, only to awake in a car driven by Cook, who doesn't know where they are or where they are going, only that the two of them are going together. A full moon appears in Effy's central episodes, both in season 3 and 4; this is a connection to Effy's dark state of mind and her depressive disorder. It is learned in the finale that Cook has been bringing Effy to \\"one small, shitty town after another\\" for weeks, and Effy is becoming gradually more dissatisfied with this seemingly aimless wandering. Cook, however, tells her that this is the town where his father lives. While Cook is content to end their journey here, Effy grows worried for Cook when she sees how his father manipulates him, prompting her to call Freddie for help — and telling him that she loves him shortly before hanging up. When Freddie and JJ arrive, they decide that the fate of the boys' relationships with Effy should be decided by the small town's race. JJ, who wins the race, takes charge and demands that they solve their problems once and for all, forcing both boys to admit that they each love Effy and telling her that she must choose between them. Although Effy doesn't say anything, her \\"look says it all\\" when her gaze lingers over Freddie, prompting Cook to leave in a fury. When Freddie and Effy are alone, they make up and have sex. The following morning Effy, Freddie, Cook, and JJ begin their journey home. Series 4 Over the summer, Effy goes with her mother to Italy, breaking up with Freddie due to the guilt she feels from the pain she caused Katie and Cook and does not contact anyone. In \\"Thomas\\", Effy does not come to the first day of school and the others assume she is still in Italy. It is revealed at the end of the first episode that she is actually back in England, and that she is with Pandora at her house comforting her after Thomas shows up, who tried to get back with her after having cheated on her. In \\"Emily\\", Effy returns to college, sits next to Freddie and reveals that it's him she was thinking about all summer. She then hugs Cook while Freddie watches. Later at a party, Effy is dancing with Freddie and kisses him. Cook sees this and lashes out at fellow party-goer Shankey and headbutts JJ without realizing who he has hurt. Effy and Freddie see him fighting and leave. In the following episode \\"Cook\\", Effy and Freddie kiss again and are overseen by Cook, who has become expelled and eventually arrested when admitting to selling drugs that led to a suicide. Effy comes to see Cook in prison and tells him she loves Freddie. She admits that love is a \\"headfuck\\", but that she is enjoying it nevertheless, which Cook seems to understand. In Freddie's episode, Effy's mother has gone on an extended vacation, leaving Effy all alone. Thus Freddie and Effy stay there, doing drugs, heavy partying and having sex. Eventually, Effy begins acting erratically, cutting out pictures of death and pasting them to her mother's bedroom wall while mentioning \\"creatures\\" coming for her. She decides to throw a \\"goodbye party\\", thus freaking much of the gang out. Freddie knocks on Effy's door three times and shakes the doorknob before she finally lets him in. When Freddie enters, he sees her hiding under the bed, visibly shaken. She tells him that he is the only one she can trust. After Freddie clears the party out, Cook remains. However, when seeing him, Effy begins to freak out, yelling at him to leave and at Freddie to make him. Freddie starts to think that Effy is developing psychosis as well as manic episodes; something his mother also dealt with. He asks his grandfather for advice and attempts to help her. When he takes Effy to a calm field, she says that the creatures are coming for her and that she used to be stronger (thus able to fight them off) but being with Freddie had made her susceptible and \\"weak\\" to them. She sees a group of people walking toward them and freaks out, believing them to be the monsters she spoke to Freddie about. Freddie scares them off. At her insistence, Freddie drives Effy home where he sees her mother talking to a police officer. Not wanting to give up on Effy yet, Freddie turns around and begins to take Effy somewhere else. On the way, they run into the Judgment Day parade. The number of people in demonic looking costumes begins to freak Effy out. She blames Freddie and runs away. Freddie tries to follow with the help of Cook, but loses sight of her. Katie, who is dancing on a float, sees a distraught Effy and rescues her, and calls Freddie over to take care of her. Freddie and Katie take her to visit his grandfather. While Freddie talks to his grandfather, Katie and Effy wait in the hall. Shortly, Katie enters the room, anxious because Effy won't come out of the bathroom. Freddie, distraught once he realizes Effy's been left alone, runs the bathroom she went to. Kicking the door open, he sees Effy lying on the floor unconscious with her wrists slashed. She is taken to hospital to be treated. In the hospital, Effy tells Freddie to go away. Later, Freddie talks to Effy's mother Anthea. She says that Effy needs both of them now. Freddie replies that she is going to have to take care of Effy alone, and runs off. He then goes back to Effy's home, rips all of her \\"death\\" pictures off the wall, and burns them in a bonfire outside. Cook shows up and tells Freddie not to give up on Effy. Since Effy's suicide attempt, she has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital, under the supervision and counselling of her psychiatrist John T. Foster. As she is permitted to leave, albeit with conditions from John, she decides to visit Freddie, in which she confirms she only has love for him, and \\"that is all\\". However, at a celebration party where all the other characters are celebrating their A levels, Effy suddenly states that she is finished and is saying goodbye to everyone - including Freddie. Over the course of the episode Effy's condition deteriorates to the point where she completely forgets who she is, and who her friends are, transforming her into a whole new person. Cook notices this and after a brief chasing scene Effy demands to be taken back to Freddie. As Cook does so he notices a duffel bag; hinting towards Freddie's near escape, the two talk and Cook leaves implying he is finished with chasing Effy. Effy is once again institutionalised, although refusing to go back under the supervision of John as it is apparent he has been using hypnotic methods to cause her to forget everything about her past and life. After a brief scuffle with Freddie, John exits hastily, and Effy states that Freddie deserves better than her. Freddie dismisses her comment and she falls asleep holding Freddie's hand and telling him she loves him over and over. The next morning John invites Freddie to his home where Freddie once again demands that John leave Effy alone. When Freddie tries to leave, the door is locked and John, brandishing a baseball bat, reveals that he wants Effy for himself, explaining \\"she really does love you, you know.\\" Freddie is heard trying to reason with John, who begins to beat him mercilessly. After a few more yells and blood splatting onto the window the counsellor continues beating the now silent Freddie. In the finale episode of series 4 we see Effy in hospital and recovering well once more. She is concerned over Freddie's sudden departure and believes that her condition scared him off. After she's seen in hospital with Pandora and Katie, Cook finds her, now out of hospital, in Freddie's shed. She shares her concerns and her feeling of rejection with him. He gives her Freddie's notebook in which Freddie declares his love for her on every page. The episode ends with her being comforted in the knowledge of Freddie's feelings for her and celebrating his birthday with all the gang in his shed. Series 7 In the two-part episode, \\"Fire\\", set three years after the ending of Series 4, Effy, now 21, is living in London with Naomi, with whom she now has a close relationship, and working a dead-end job as a receptionist in a high-profile hedge fund. In the years since her last appearance, she has become more mature, principled and assertive. Effy eventually becomes a stock trader with some help of her friend, Dominic (Craig Roberts), who claims to be in love with her. After achieving success through illicit information provided to her by Dominic, she pursues a relationship with Jake (Kayvan Novak), her wealthy boss, and begins to live the high life. Unfortunately, this is short-lived when the Financial Services Authority receives a tip-off, and evidence, that her success was the result of insider trading, and Jake places the blame squarely with her (although he had actually encouraged her to do it). To make matters worse, her personal life is shattered when Naomi is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Effy finds herself having to deal with both the possibility of going to prison and the pain of losing Naomi. Eventually, after managing to get Emily back to London to ensure that Naomi's last days will be spent with her beloved girlfriend at her side, she agrees, after some sympathy from Victoria, Jake's ex-girlfriend and the FSA agent investigating Effy, to sign a confession that will name Jake and reduce her own prison sentence. Effy's story ends with Effy being placed into a police car to be taken into custody, her trademark wry smile crossing her face.

The upper church and its medieval vaulted crypt is located at the lower end of Broad Street and is built into the old city's medieval walls. Design and construction Printed line engraving from 1816 showing the south view of the old city gate of Bristol, UK, with the Church of St John the Baptist, Bristol tower above it, and Nave built into the city walls. The engraving shows historic buildings around the church which are no longer standing, and eight figures walking through the gate in 19th century costume. On the right of the picture can be seen the building abutting the church which held the St John's Conduit on the east side of the building on Broad Street. The conduit today is on the west side within the old city walls on Quay Street. The church was built in the 14th century (and heavily modified in the 19th century) with the tower and steeple over St John's Gate, the last remaining city gateway. The church is very narrow as it is built into and alongside the city walls. Consequently, it is also known as St John's on the Wall. The rood stair entrance high up on the wall shows where the earlier great rood screen would have stood. Similar rood stair entrances can be seen at St Peter's, St Philip and Jacob, St Stephen's and Temple.M Q Smith, The Medieval Churches of Bristol, The University of Bristol (Bristol Branch of the Historical Association), 1970. Beneath the church is a vaulted crypt, which was dedicated to the Holy Cross. A conduit has supplied water from Brandon Hill since 1374, and the course of the pipe is marked in places by small plaques set into the pavements. Monuments and artwork Among the monuments in the church are those of Walter Frampton (died 1357), thrice Mayor of Bristol and a great benefactor of the church, and a brass commemorating Thomas Rowley (died c. 1478), whose name was used by the 18th-century teenage poet Thomas Chatterton as a pseudonym under which to write his forgeries of medieval poetry. On the south side of the gate, there are statues of the legendary founders of Bristol, Brennus and Belinus, facing up Broad Street; it is possible that they are actually older than the fabric of the gate. The interiors of the two arches either side of the main gateway are now covered in commissioned graffiti murals. The burial ground of St John's survives; it is visible from John Street and the entrance gate is in Tailors Court which is accessed from Broad Street. The burial ground is closed to the public. Archives Parish records for St John the Baptist church, Bristol are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. P.St JB) (online catalogue) including baptism and marriage registers and a burial register. The archive also includes records of the incumbent, churchwardens, overseer of the Poor, parochial church council, charities, schools and vestry plus deeds, plans and photographs. Current usage St. John on the Wall is cared for by The Churches Conservation Trust, the national heritage charity. It is open daily for free tours and interactive visitor displays telling the story of medieval Bristol. St John on the Wall hosts a small programme of free family events, gigs, exhibitions and concerts. It's recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building.

Lyon was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario who was elected in 1875 to represent the riding of Halton. In 1879, he became the de facto governor of the District of Rainy River, holding executive, judicial and magisterial power over the new settlements situated west of Ontario.  Background  Lyon was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1825 and the fourth child of John Lyon (c.1791–1876) and Catherine, née McFarlane (1788–1853). His family immigrated to Upper Canada in 1832 and settled in the Esquesing Township of Halton County, Ontario. In 1853, he married Mary MacEachern, a fellow Scottish émigré from the Scotch Block.  Business career  Lyon operated a number of businesses in Milton, including an extensive general store selling dry goods, groceries and hardware, and oversaw the erection of a new gristmill with Edward Martin (father of Joseph) in 1856, replacing its fire-damaged predecessor.Pope, p. 79 He and his younger brother Robert Adam were also partnered in a number of ventures, including a store they ran together for seventeen years under the firm name, W. D. and R. A. Lyon's. In 1866, William and Robert moved to Manitoulin Island where they erected a sawmill, set up a mercantile and lumbering business and established a settlement in Michael's Bay. William returned to Milton in 1868, to continue his work as a merchant in the town.  Political career  Lyon's family became closely involved in local politics when they arrived in Canada. His father, John, was associated with the Reform movement in Upper Canada, and vocally opposed to the Family Compact and Established Church. William's political career began as a councillor of the Trafalgar Township and continued as a member of the Milton town council. He was elected Mayor of Milton in 1862, serving for four years. He and his brother, Robert, both pursued work in public affairs alongside their business careers.  Member of Provincial Parliament  In 1871, the Liberal Party dropped the local MPP William Barber as their candidate in the upcoming election, due to his support for Premier J. Sandfield Macdonald's self-described \\"Patent Combination\\" government.Pope, p. 88 In his stead, the party selected Lyon and the radical 'Clear Grits' platform he championed. Despite the withdrawal of Liberal support, Barber ran as an independent and successfully fended off Lyon's challenge, largely thanks to the significant Conservative support he had acquired.Pope, p. 83 Although he was unsuccessful in ousting Barber in 1871, Lyon remained active in Ontarian politics as a councillor, reeve and postmaster. In 1873, he was elected Warden of Halton County. Four years after initially deselecting Barber, the Liberal Party readopted him at the 1875 election, thus preventing Lyon from contesting the riding of Halton on behalf of the party. However, in June 1875, Barber's re-election to a third term in office was deemed void in a subsequent election trial that had been brought about by petition. With Barber's unseating, the Liberal Party convened to determine a new candidate in the consequential by-election; on October 4, they chose Lyon. He went on to be elected Member of the 3rd Parliament of Ontario in the following month, defeating the Conservative candidate Col. William Clay by 1363 votes to 1196. During his time as a parliamentarian, Lyon sat on both the Standing Committee on Standing Orders and Railways, and was also considered a close political ally of Liberal Party leader Oliver Mowat. His confident performances in and outside the Provincial Parliament led John Henry Pope to write in 1877: > He has always taken a decided stand on the Reform side of politics, is a > ready speaker, has an extensive knowledge of public affairs, and is gifted > with a large share of common sense. = Electoral history  Stipendiary Magistrate  In 1879, the Parliament of Ontario passed an Act asserting its jurisdiction over territory that had been awarded through arbitration between Canada and Ontario, and passed complementary legislation relating to the administration of justice in the area, which established executive positions to oversee the governance of the new settler communities and their aborigine neighbors: to the north, the Stipendiary Magistrate of the District of Nipissing, and to the west, the Stipendiary Magistrate of the District of Thunder Bay West (which later became the Rainy River District). In the following month, acting on the advice of his Premier, the Lieutenant Governor appointed Lyon to Thunder Bay West, requiring him to resign his parliamentary seat and not contest the upcoming election. In May, former federal MP Edward Borron was appointed to Nipissing. These appointments were by no means without political motivation, as Premier Oliver Mowat wished to assert the authority of the provincial Ontarian Government against the federal Dominion Government; he had chosen two Liberal allies to protect the province’s interests, keep the peace and oversee the enforcement of Ontarian law. Lyon moved west to take up residence in Alberton on the Rainy River. In December 1879 he was instructed by the provincial government to continue further north to Rat Portage, on the other side of the Lake of the Woods. He arrived on January 7, 1880, and settled in the town with his youngest daughter, Annie Elizabeth, while the rest of his family remained in Milton. He chose to make the town his base of operations, soon establishing a courthouse upon purchasing a lot from the Hudson's Bay Company, and making improvements to local infrastructure. His duties required that he regularly tour the district to keep informed of growing settlements and the issues they faced, and then report his findings back to the Ontarian Parliament. In his judicial capacity, Lyon frequently dealt with cases concerning the aboriginal population and worked closely with the tribal chiefs in the area. Such was the mutual respect, between himself and the chiefs, that Lyon was able to attend a tribal meeting to face down the young warriors who had encouraged killing the white settlers and joining the North-West Rebellion. = Ontario-Manitoba dispute = The power struggle between federal and provincial government had worsened since Lyon's arrival in the district, as Premier Oliver Mowat faced opposition from Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and his Conservative ministry. Macdonald's government did not pass coordinating legislation to confirm Ontario's 1879 boundary with the District of Keewatin, but arranged for the passage of an Act expanding Manitoba's border eastwards, thus creating a territorial dispute with Ontario. In the interim, a temporary Act was also passed which allowed both Ontario and Manitoba to exercise their powers over the administration of justice within the territory in dispute. The subsequent provincial conflict threw the administration of the Rainy River District into disarray, with Rat Portage at the centre of a crisis in which Ontarian and Manitoban officials sought to take control whilst the Dominion continued to lay claim to its own authority. At the height of this dispute, Lyon's position had become completely undermined by there existing three separate police forces and three sets of magistrates in the town, all claiming jurisdiction. The chaos facing Lyon was made all too clear on a day in May 1881, when federal agents stormed his courthouse and imprisoned his bailiff. After two years of political uncertainty and dispute in the town, the Manitoban Attorney-General James A. Miller (also MLA for Rat Portage in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba) agreed with Oliver Mowat that the issue should be brought before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In 1884, the committee chose to award the disputed territory to Ontario; however, the Dominion Government delayed the implementation of their recommendations, choosing instead to appropriate the land, timber and mines from Ontario. Lyon wrote in 1886 that the people he governed \\"are no longer disposed to submit quietly to the wanton and wilful injustice inflicted upon them\\". His words reflected the existing tensions and the present threat of civil war in the region, pitting Ontario against the Dominion. A resolution to the matter was finally achieved with the passage of the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act by the Imperial Parliament in 1889, establishing Ontario’s present western border and enabling Lyon to reassert his authority as Stipendiary Magistrate.  Death  In the autumn of 1893, after fourteen years working in Rat Portage, Lyon returned to Milton as his health was declining. He stayed in the house of his son-in-law John Wallace, Jr., where he died on October 18. Three days later, prominent political figures from across the county attended the funeral service as his body was buried in Evergreen Cemetery.

The first church on the site was established in the 8th century. In the 10th century a Benedictine priory was founded. Construction of the present building began in the early 13th century and it has been rebuilt several times since. It has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building. From the late 12th century to the middle of the 16th century it was the collegiate church for Westbury College; of the latter, little more than the college gatehouse remains. The church contains the tomb of John Carpenter, Bishop of Worcester, who had planned to make it a joint cathedral for the Worcester diocese.  History = Early years  The date the first church was founded has traditionally been put at 716-17; the historical record does show two foundations at this date, but these were actually at Yate and Bredon. Nevertheless, a church did exist by the end of the 8th century, as King Offa founded a minster on the site between 793 and 796. The minster became a Benedictine priory around 963-64. It was the first reformation of a minster by Bishop Oswald of Worcester, in his introduction of the Rule of Saint Benedict into the diocese. He brought the English monk Germanus from Fleury Abbey as the new Prior. However Oswald soon decided to move the community to Ramsey, after he acquired land in 966 for the foundation of Ramsey Abbey. The priory buildings eventually fell into disrepair. Around 1093 Bishop Wulfstan reacquired the dilapidated priory and rebuilt it as a monastery under the control of the Worcester diocese.  Collegiate church  Holy Trinity Church in 1882 Over the next century, there were successive evictions as monks and secular priests alternated in possession of the monastery; this was finally resolved in favour of the secular priests when the church become collegiate around 1194. The canons of Westbury College were each supported by revenues from one of the areas around Westbury on Trym, including Aust, Henbury and Lawrence Weston. The great reformist John Wycliffe was a canon from 1362 until his death in 1384, although in 1367 he was accused of neglecting his duties as prebendary of Aust due to his long absence. The prominent Bristol merchant William Canynge was dean of the college from 1469 until his death in 1474. In 1544, with the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the church became a parish church within the new Bristol diocese, and the residential buildings of Westbury College passed into the hands of Sir Ralph Sadler.  Architecture  The present building all dates to after 1194. The nave and aisles are early 13th century, in the Early English style. The remainder of the church is in the Perpendicular style. The nave clerestory, chancel, choir and north chapel are the result of extensive rebuilding by Bishop Carpenter in the middle of the 15th century. The chancel has a polygonal apse, which is rare for the late Gothic period. The church tower, although also from this period, was restored in the middle of the 19th century. The reredos, which depicts the Last Supper, is also 19th century.  Memorials  Although Bishop Carpenter's plan to make the church a joint cathedral with Worcester did not come to fruition, it was he who rededicated the church to the Holy Trinity. On his death in 1476 he was buried in the crypt underneath the altar. The stone cadaver from his cadaver tomb is in the chancel, with a Purbeck marble canopy donated in 1853 by Oriel College, Oxford, where he had been Provost. Churchyard The churchyard contains war graves of a soldier and officer of the Gloucestershire Regiment and a Royal Flying Corps officer of World War I.

Sanders is known for his work on another ABC show, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. The show was cancelled by ABC and was repackaged as Bingo America on GSN, first hosted by Patrick Duffy, and in October 2008 by Richard Karn. The creator of this program, Andrew Glassman, also created the reality television game Average Joe. The game is an interactive experience for both the studio audience and viewers at home. On NBN, members of the studio audience attempted to win a game of bingo while competing with a solo studio contestant. For Bingo America, it is played as a straight general knowledge quiz format with two players and a home viewer bingo game within. Home viewers play along with pre- printed game cards that are available from the network website just before each episode airs, and are also eligible to win prizes. The show was expected to return for a five-episode run during the week of December 17, 2007,Movie & TV News @ IMDb.com - Studio Briefing - 9 July 2007ABC Clears Card for Bingo Night - 7/9/2007 3:16:00 AM - Broadcasting & Cable but on November 13, 2007, ABC decided to replace it instead with its new game show, Duel. In 2008, the show was cancelled and was afterward shopped to other networks. Eventually GSN acquired the rights and the game was repackaged into a five-day-a-week 30-minute version with modifications listed below. Gameplay=National Bingo Night Each hour-long episode of NBN was divided into three games - Red, White, and Blue. Only cards with the correct designation were eligible to win prizes. Unlike the audience members, studio contestants did not actually have a bingo card. Instead, they participated in stunt games. During these games, they took guesses on what the next ball to be drawn from an oversized bingo drum will be. Generally, this took the form of odd or even, red or black numbers (originally red or black decals on the balls), or whether the next number is higher or lower than the previous one. On at least two occasions, the stunt was to draw balls that contained a certain number, such as five 5's (\\"High Five\\"; drawing G-55 would count for two 5's) or four 9's (\\"Baseball\\") If the contestant successfully completes the stunt before anyone in the studio audience gets a bingo, the contestant wins one of various prizes. If not, then an audience member wins $5,000 (or a prize the studio contestant failed to win on at least one occasion). In the event that the in-studio contestant completes their game and an audience member gets a bingo, only the audience member wins. All games were winner-take-all. Non-winning contestants received nothing. Bingo America The format was later retooled as Bingo America and aired new episodes on GSN from March 31, 2008 to January 2, 2009. In the new format, two contestants competed on each show for a top prize of $100,000. The new version also included an at-home element in which viewers had the chance to win prizes.

Moysés worked in many fields: from literary creation to painting, from film making to holography. He was driven by singular curiosity and diligence and typified as a \\"Renaissance Man\\" joining science with art throughout his accomplishments. Baumstein began his artistic career as a painter influenced by the Spanish painter Joan Ponç, with whom he founded the group “L´Espai” in São Paulo in 1960. He later became interested in photography, cinema and theatre and at the beginning of the seventies began to write experimental fiction and produce animation cinema in Super8 and 16mm. In 1981 founded Videcom, a video production house in São Paulo directed for corporate and cultural productions. It was not until 1982 that he began to work in holography, using artisanal methods. He completed and perfected his technique in 1983 after a holography workshop with the German artist Dieter Jung (artist). In the same year he had his first holographic exhibition at the Museu da Imagem e do Som (MIS) in São Paulo. In 1984 he developed a specific holographic technique for chromatic control and began the regular production of technically very elaborate works. At that time in his holographic studio he began the production of commercial holograms as well as artistic works. In some of his projects in this field he worked in collaboration with other Brazilian artists and poets interested in holography (Augusto de Campos, Décio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and José Wagner Garcia). The results of such collaboration were shown at the “Triluz” exhibition (1986) in the Museu da Imagem e do Som, and at the “Idehologia” exhibition (1987) in the Museu de Arte Contemporânea, São Paulo, amongst others. With José Wagner Garcia he created the prototype of a holographic cinema projector a \\"Holographic Kinetoscope\\". A year after his death a retrospective of his cinema and video works was held at the 9th International “Videobrasil” Festival - 1992 in São Paulo. Holographic poems by Augusto de Campos and produced by Baumstein were purchased by the \\"Centre Régional des Lettres de Basse-Normandie\\" in France and in 2007, the holographic poem REVER was exhibited at the exhibition \\"Concrete Poetry - O Projeto Verbivocovisual\\" in Tomie Ohtake Institute (São Paulo) and at the Palácio das Artes (Belo Horizonte). Videcom kept the activities of his holographic laboratory until 2007 when all the equipment was donated to the Optical Lab from the University of Campinas Physics Institute under the responsibility of Jose Lunazzi. Between September and November 2010 his holograms were presented at the exhibition \\"TEKHNE\\" (Tekhne page in English/Portuguese and Spanish) at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP) in São Paulo, which introduced the discussion of the importance of the convergence between art and technology.

He was in charge of the Overseas Food Corporation during the disastrous Tanganyika groundnut scheme in the late 1940s; later he became a Labour Party Member of Parliament where he pioneered attempts to outlaw racial discrimination. Newspaper business Plummer was born in Demerara, British Guiana, where his father was working. He was educated at Tottenham Grammar School in North London, and first worked on the managerial staff of the Daily Herald from 1919. In 1922 he became general manager for the New Leader, a paper edited by H. N. Brailsford as the party journal of the Independent Labour Party. Plummer shared the left-wing sentiments of the ILP. In 1923 Plummer married Beatrice Lapsker. They had no children. Plummer was selected as Labour Party candidate for Birmingham Edgbaston in the mid-1920s but gave up the candidacy in May 1927.The Times, 4 May 1927.

In 1943 he was general manager of the company.See list of attendees at the requiem mass for the Earl of Kenmare in The Times of 29 September 1943. Plummer prospered at the Daily Express group despite disagreeing on politics with the proprietor Lord Beaverbrook because of his own skill as an administrator and Beaverbrook's known liking for talent-spotting among left-wingers. Overseas Food Corporation Plummer left the Daily Express when he was named by John Strachey as chairman-designate of the Overseas Food Corporation at the end of 1947. However the appointment was not confirmed until February 1948. The Corporation was created to take charge of the Tanganyika groundnut scheme, a massive project to cultivate peanuts on 325 million acres (1,320,000 km²) of scrubland in Tanganyika Territory. The scheme was well advanced by the time Plummer moved in, but he was an enthusiastic supporter. In January 1949 he went out to take personal charge of the scheme.\\"Mr. Plummer flying to East Africa\\", The Times, 19 January 1949.

Plummer and Wakefield had a lengthy exchange of public statements, in which Wakefield accused Plummer of suppressing his suggestions.\\"Groundnut Plan Statements\\", The Times, 21 November 1949.

His appointment was called into question by Alan Lennox-Boyd because Strachey had been an old colleague of his in the Independent Labour Party.\\"Inquiry into Groundnuts Refused\\", The Times, 22 November 1949.

Better known to mediaeval and Tudor historians as the Gaunt's Chapel, it has also been known within Bristol since 1722 as the Lord Mayor's Chapel. It is one of only two churches in England privately owned and used for worship by a city corporation. The other is St Lawrence Jewry, London. It stands opposite St Augustine's Abbey (after 1542 Bristol Cathedral), founded by a member of the Berkeley family of nearby Berkeley Castle, from which it was originally separated by the Abbey's burial ground, now called College Green. It was built as the chapel to the adjacent Gaunt's Hospital, now demolished, founded in 1220. Except for the west front, the church has been enclosed by later adjacent buildings, although the tower is still visible. The church contains some fine late gothic features and a collection of continental stained glass. It is designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building.

Legend in Lombardic capitals: S(IGILLUM) CO(MMUN)E DOM(US) S(AN)C(T)I MARCI(I) DE BILLESWYK JUXTA BRISTOLL(IAM) (\\"The common seal of the House of St Mark of Billeswyk-by-Bristol\\"). The upper 2/3 consists of 2 gothic niches, the right hand one containing the figure of St Mark seated at a desk writing his gospel. In the niche opposite is a lion, the evangelist's emblem, sejant rampant. In the lower 1/3 within a simple lancet shaped niche is the kneeling figure of the donor with hands together in prayer, looking above right towards the saint in supplication. There are 3 heater-shaped escutcheons, the former heraldic designs on which have been worn away In 1220 Maurice de Gaunt (d.1230), a grandson of Robert Fitzharding (d.1170), first feudal baron of Berkeley, Gloucestershire, founded a hospital, that is to say a mediaeval charitable residential institution, next to his grandfather's foundation of St Augustine's Abbey, to provide relief for the sick and poor. It was to be called the \\"Hospital of St Mark of Billeswyke-by-Bristol\\" and was housed in the Abbey's almonry. On Maurice’s death in 1230, his nephew Robert de Gournay added to its endowment, made it independent of the Abbey and placed it under the control of Maurice's brother Henry de Gaunt. It became known informally as St Mark's Hospital or Gaunt's Hospital. The church for the use of the inmates of the hospital was built around 1230, and is the only part of the buildings extant today. Maurice de Gaunt also founded Blackfriars in about 1227-9 (the cloisters now known as Quakers Friars).M Q Smith, The Medieval Churches of Bristol, University of Bristol (Bristol Branch of the Historical Association, 1970, p. 14. Notable burials The church contains several chest tombs. Two of these, in the south aisle chapel, are of knights which may be the church's founders, Maurice de Gaunt and Robert de Gournay. There are more for other members of the Berkeley family, to which the founders were related. The chest tomb with effigy of Miles Salley(d.1516), Bishop of Llandaff from 1500, is in the chancel, to the south side of the altar.

Anne's brother Sir Walter Denys(died 1571) was awarded the receivership of St Augustine's Abbey. Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School From 1590 to 1767 a school known as Queen Elizabeth's Hospital utilised the former hospital building next to the church and used the church as its chapel. Huguenot use Following the arrival of many Huguenots who fled from France to Bristol in the 17th century, Bristol City Corporation allowed them to use the chapel, from 1687 to 1722. Lord Mayor's chapel In 1722 it became the official church of the Mayor and Corporation of Bristol. Architecture The nave was built around 1230, and the south aisle around 1270-80\\\\. These parts are in the early decorated gothic style, while the rest of the church is of the later perpendicular style. The tower, constructed over the east end, was completed in 1487. The chancel, south aisle chapel and reredos are the result of rebuilding by Miles Salley(d.1516), Bishop of Llandaff, in about 1500. The nave's roof and another side chapel are early 16th century. The west front, with its geometric 12-petalled rose window, was a 15th-century design but was rebuilt in about 1830. In 1889 John Loughborough Pearson created a new west entrance, in the gothic style. Poyntz chapel Another fine addition, to the east end of the south aisle, beyond the tower, is the \\"Chapel of Jesus\\" or \\"Poyntz Chapel\\", built c.1523 as a chantry chapel by Sir Robert Poyntz (d.1520) of Iron Acton, Gloucestershire, a noted supporter of King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. It should be distinguished from the Poyntz Chapel in Iron Acton Church, the family's chapel as lords of the manor. It is fan-vaulted, and has two niches of unknown use on the North wall.M Q Smith, The Medieval Churches of Bristol, University of Bristol (Bristol Branch of the Historical Association), 1970, p. 23 The floor is covered with coloured Spanish tiles, probably from Seville and contemporaneous with the building.Lord Mayor's Chapel, Spanish tile details. Stained glass In the early 19th century, Bristol Corporation took advantage of the sales of the collections of Sir Paul Baghott at Lypiatt Park and William Thomas Beckford at Fonthill Abbey to acquire an assortment of fine Continental stained glass for the church. From France there is a 15th-century depiction of two saints in the East window. There is more French glass in the nave, consisting of 16th-century mannerist work with grisaille, from Ecouen, and some 16th-century Bible scenes. From Steinfeld Abbey in Germany there are some 16th-century saints in the Poyntz chapel. In the south aisle chapel are 24 German and Flemish roundels, of the 16th or 17th centuries. The depiction of Thomas Becket in the south aisle, by Benjamin West in 1799, is also from Fonthill Abbey. Fittings The church contains some fine baroque wrought iron by the Bristol blacksmith William Edney. These consist of a sword rest of 1702 and the screen and gate for the south aisle chapel, which date to 1726. These were all moved from Temple Church after it was bombed in the Bristol Blitz during World War II. Archives Archives for the Lord Mayor's Chapel are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. LMC) (online catalogue) including administration, finance, building alterations, music, and service registers. Current usage The church is open regularly for visitors and worship. It was recently used to exhibit a unique artwork involving caged birds singing along with a live pianist.A Concert for the Birds See also * Churches in Bristol * Grade I listed buildings in Bristol Bibliography *Barker, W.R., St Mark's or The Mayor's Chapel, Bristol (Formerly Called the Church of the Gaunts), Bristol, 1892 *Cartulary of St Mark's Hospital, Bristol.

Herring; findagrave.com Retrieved November 3, 2015 was an American aviation pioneer, who sometimes is claimed by Michigan promoters to be the first true aviator of a motorized heavier-than-air aircraft.America's First Airplane Flight :: The Southwest Michigan Directory. Swmidirectory.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-19. Biography Herring was born in Covington, Georgia, to William F. Herring, a wealthy cotton broker, and his wife Cloe Perry Conyers. He studied in both Switzerland and Germany, before his family settled in New York in 1884. In 1885-6, as a student at the Stevens Institute of Technology, Herring was already building models of flying machines. By 1893, he had built a full sized glider – which he crashed when trying to leave the ground. He began studying glider expert Otto Lilienthal's work. In 1894, Herring built a Type 11-monoplane glider based on Otto Lilienthal‘s 1893 German patent. Herring was then hired by Octave Chanute to build and test aircraft models from plans drawn up by either Herring and Chanute. Later in 1895, Samuel Pierpont Langley hired Herring to assist in his experiments. Herring was rehired by Chanute in January 1896, but continued experimenting on his own. In December 1896, he applied for a patent of a man-supporting, heavier-than-air \\"flying machine\\" that was motor powered and controllable, but the patent application was rejected.Chanute Bibliography. Spicerweb.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-19. On October 10, 1898, Herring telegraphed Chanute to come and watch him fly a powered aeroplane of his own design, based on the Chanute-type biplane structure, using a compressed air engine at Silver Beach Amusement Park in St. Joseph, Michigan. He could not get airborne. Herring was reported to have made a longer flight on October 22, witnessed by two locals. In 1909 Herring joined Glenn Curtiss to create the Herring-Curtiss Company. The next year, he left Curtiss and joined Starling Burgess in Marblehead, Massachusetts to design and build aeroplanes. He left Burgess after a year, following disagreements with another Burgess partner, Greely S. Curtis. Herring brought suit against Glenn Curtiss, claiming he had been cheated out of his property and ideas, but we have to remember that the patent Herring claimed to have did not exist. Herring did some aviation design work for the United States Army during World War I, he later was partially paralyzed by a series of strokes. He died in 1926 at the age of 59, survived by his wife, the former Lillian Mellen. Ironically, four years later Herring won his suit against Curtiss with a sizeable financial award. Claims as first to fly Aviation historian Phil Scott in The Shoulders of Giants: A History of Human Flight to 1919 (1995, ) wrote that he does not consider Herring a candidate for the first flight claim. Scott says Herring's glider was difficult to steer and his two-cylinder, three-horsepower compressed air engine could operate for only 30 seconds at a time. Scott considers Herring as having simply expanded the traditional hang-gliding by adding an engine. Herring's defenders point out that hang-glider fliers today steer their aircraft by shifting their body, as Herring did. This method was superseded by the Wright Brothers system of dynamic three axis control used by most aircraft flying today.

It has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building. History Black and white engraving of St Stephen's Church, Bristol, UK, published c.1838. The view is from the south east of the church, showing the body of the church on the right of the image and the distinctive tall, thin tower in the centre. In front of the church can be seen two horses and carts. From 1240 to 1892 the Bristol Harbour was on the opposite side of the church when it was filled in. It was built, on the site of an 11th-century church, in the 14th century and rebuilt around 1470. The tower and east window were paid for by John Shipward, four times Mayor of Bristol, who died in 1473, the tower being built by the mason Benedict (or Benet) Crosse. The site was on the banks of the River Frome, which was diverted at around this time to create Bristol Harbour. The clerestory was repaired after a storm in 1703. The aisle and east windows were restored in 1873. The tower measures approximately 18 ft by 20 ft at its base, and rises to a total height of 152 ft. It originally contained six bells but these have been replaced over the years and the number increased to twelve. The tower is typical of Somerset churches, but with the addition of a \\"Gloucestershire crown\\" of arcaded battlements, pinnacles and open-work arcading. The 15th-century brass eagle lectern and the iron sword rest by William Edney of about 1710 were moved to St Stephen's from St Nicholas church, which was damaged in the Bristol Blitz. In 1885, a young man named Ramsay MacDonald took up a position as an assistant to Mordaunt Crofton, a Bristol clergyman who was attempting to establish a Boys' and Young Men's Guild at St Stephen's Church. It was in Bristol that Ramsay MacDonald joined his first Radical organisation, before moving to London in early 1886. Later, MacDonald became the first Labour Party Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

Arnaq and Kalicho, who were amongst the first North Americans to visit Britain (having been seized by Martin Frobisher), were buried at this church as \\"heathens\\" in 1577. A significant tomb is that of Martin Pring, who died at the age of 46 in 1627. He was a navigator, explorer and merchant and discovered what is now called Cape Cod Bay. The monument is draped with painted mermaids and mermen and verses to his exploits. Sir Walter Tyddesley, who died in 1385, and Sir George Snigge also have ornate tombs in the church. Also commemorated, but this time in a wall-mounted plaque, is Robert Kitchin, who died in 1594, a donor of one of the famous bronze \\"nails\\" (merchants' counting tables) found outside The Exchange in Bristol.

In late August and September of 1999, Russia mounted a massive air campaign over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan the previous month. Russian Air Force commander Anatoly Kornukov suggested there were similarities between the attacks on Chechnya and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.Asia Times: Russia employs NATO's 'barbarous' tactics Campaign On August 26, 1999 Russia acknowledged bombing raids in Chechnya.CNN - Russia acknowledges bombing raids in Chechnya - August 26, 1999 Russian aircraft attacked several targets in Serzhen-Yurt, Benoy and along the Vedeno gorge. To help rally political support for the operation, the FSB released a videotape of Chechen militants committing atrocities against Russian soldiers. \\"We should hit, hit and once again hit them until Mr. Maskhadov says that there's nobody left except civilians. Then we should get in and see that for ourselves,\\" said a member of the Duma's defense committee.CNN - Anti-Russian atrocities spur support for Chechen airstrikes - September 28, 1999 On September 23, 1999, the first in a series of missile attacks on the Chechen capital Grozny was launched. The first target was the Sheikh Mansur (Severny) Grozny Airport, situated 2 kilometres from the city centre. In the north-east, burning fuel depots and the Grozny oil refinery and enveloping the capital in a cloud of smoke. During the next two days of Russian air attacks on the city at least 31 people were killed and more than 60 injured. On September 27, 1999, at least 42 people were killed and more than 200 injured in the bombing raids on Grozny. Effects Until September 25, 1999 Russian warplanes had carried out at least 1,700 sorties since the bombing runs began. Russian command claimed that a total of 150 military bases have been destroyed, along with 30 bridges, 80 vehicles and six radio transmitters, while 250 kilometers of mountain roads were mined. In early October the Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said some 60-70 percent of the bridges in Chechnya have been destroyed. The air strikes quickly crippled Chechnya's stationary and mobile telephone system and hit the Chechen television station. The electricity supply was also cut; in addition to its other consequences, the loss of electricity further crippled the Chechen administration's ability to compete in the information war.Second Chechnya War The attacks were reported to have killed hundreds of civilians and forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes. The neighbouring region of Ingushetia was reported to have appealed for United Nations aid to deal with tens of thousands of refugees.RTÉ News: Russia launches more air strikes against Chechnya On October 2, 1999 Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations admitted that 78,000 people have fled the air strikes in Chechnya; most of them were heading for Ingushetia, where they are arriving at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day.

Ottawa, Ontario Canada 1897–11 Printing plant in the South Bronx ABCorp is an American corporation providing contract manufacturing and related services to the Authentication, Payment and Secure Access sectors. Its history dates back to 1795 as a secure engraver and printer, and assisting the newly formed First Bank of the United States to design and produce more counterfeit resistant currency. ABCorp's customers span the Commercial, Financial, and Government & Not-for-Profit sectors, across 100+ countries. The company has facilities in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. American Bank Note Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of ABCorp. Origins Robert Scot, the first official engraver of the young U.S. Mint, began the company that would eventually grow into the nation's premier high security engraving and printing firm, the American Bank Note Company. Founded in 1795 as Murray, Draper, Fairman & Company (after Scot's three partners), the company prospered as the young United States population expanded and financial institutions blossomed. Its products included superior quality stock and bond certificates, paper currency for the nation's thousands of state-chartered banks, postage stamps (from 1879 to 1894Two security printers absorbed into the ABN in 1879 produced U. S. Postage stamps between 1861 and that year: the National Bank Note Company (1861-73) and the Continental Banknote Company (1873-79), and a wide variety of other engraved and printed items. After 1857 On April 29, 1858, following the Panic of 1857, seven of the nation's most prominent security printers merged to form the American Bank Note Company. The new company made New York City its headquarters. Less than two years later, the remaining handful of independent bank note printers merged to form the National Bank Note Company that we know of today. To be close to the stock exchanges, brokerage firms, and banks in lower Manhattan, the American Bank Note Company established its New York City headquarters in the Merchants Exchange Building at 55 Wall Street. The company moved its office and plant to 142 Broadway (at the corner of Liberty Street) in 1867, to another new facility at 78–86 Trinity Place in 1882, and again to 70 Broad Street in 1908. The first federally issued paper currency was circulated by the US Treasury Department following the outbreak of the Civil War. Congress passed authorizing legislation for $60 million worth of these \\"Demand Notes\\" on July 17 and August 5, 1861. Under contract with the government, the novel paper money, called \\"greenbacks\\" by the public, was produced by the American Bank Note Co. and the National Bank Note Co. A total of 7.25 million notes were produced in denominations of $5, $10, and $20. In an interesting historical sidelight, American and National were also producing paper money for the Confederacy at the same time. 100 pesos Banco Italiano del Uruguay (1887) American Bank Note Company, Share certificate (1944) Following the initial production of U.S. currency by the government's Bureau of Engraving and Printing in 1862, ABNCo sought a new source of demand for its services. They found it in foreign lands. The company would eventually go on to supply security paper and bank notes to 115 foreign countries. In 1877, pursuant to a law enacted by Congress, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing became the sole producer of all United States currency. The security printing industry, finding a good deal of its work had evaporated, accordingly underwent a second major consolidation in 1879, as American absorbed the National Bank Note and Continental Bank Note companies. At the time of the merger, Continental held the contract to produce U. S. Postage stamps, and this production continued under the American aegis. In 1887, ABNCo won the second four-year contract to engrave and print Postal notes for the U.S. post office. (New York's Homer Lee Bank Note Company produced these notes during the first contract period.) American assigned Thomas F. Morris, its Chief Designer, the task of re- designing this early money order. The paper for this contract (as for all Postal Notes and a massive number of official U.S. high security documents) was produced by Crane and Co. of Dalton, Massachusetts. In 1891 the American Bank Note Company began producing a new form of money for a longtime customer: the American Express \\"Travelers Cheque.\\" In its first year, American Express sold $9,120 worth of its new invention. During 2000, sales of American Express Traveler's Cheques totaled $24.6 billion. In 1894, ABNCo completed the final contract for the private printing of American stamps. Perhaps their most popular stamps were the Columbian Issue, one cent to $5 issues commemorating the voyages of Christopher Columbus and the 1892–93 Columbian Exposition (for which they had also printed the admission tickets) in Chicago. On July 1, 1894, American delivered its entire stamp-producing operation to the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C., where U.S. stamps were still printed up into the 1990s. Twentieth Century In 1933, the company printed the second series of Bank Melli Iran banknotes. In 1943 the U.S. Post Office launched a series of thirteen stamps honoring the countries that had been overrun by the axis during World War II. Each stamp featured a full-color reproduction of one of the occupied nations. While the Bureau of Engraving and Printing had previously issued bi-colored stamps, it did not have equipment for printing the necessary multi-colored flag images; and so, contracted with the American Banknote Company to produce the stamps. Issued between June 1943 and November 1944, the Overrun Countries series reproduced the flags of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Austria, Denmark, and Korea,The Overrun Countries Series - Junior Philatelists.

It was built in 1839 by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and has been designated by Historic England as a Grade I listed building. The contract was originally awarded to William Ranger, who fell behind with the build and had his construction plant seized so the Great Western Railway company could finish construction. Ranger started legal proceedings against the company, but they were eventually quashed by Lord Cranworth. The bridge carries the Great Western Main Line over the River Avon into Bristol Temple Meads station, approximately west (downstream) of Netham Weir. Construction The Great Western Railway company engaged Isambard Kingdom Brunel to build a bridge on the eastern approach to Bristol Temple Meads. Brunel designed a masonry bridge with a wide central arch and a smaller arch on either side; all three arches are in a gothic style. The entire structure is made of squared stone with semi-octagonal buttresses and was completed in 1839. Subsequently a truss girder bridge was added on either side of the Avon Bridge to widen it, obscuring the structure. The structure became Grade I Listed on 8 June 1990. The contract for building the bridge went to William Ranger in March 1836, with work beginning that April. The stone for the bridge was intended to be taken from the cutting of the nearby No. 1 Tunnel. Ranger fell behind schedule, and by 1838, when shareholders had intended the line to be open, Great Western Railway declared his work unsatisfactory. Under the terms of their contract with him they seized his plant to complete the works themselves. Ranger valued his plant at £70,000 (), and started legal proceeding against the Great Western Railway, stating he had been deceived about the nature of the stone he was cutting into, believing it was sandstone and discovering it was Pennant stone. He also complained that Brunel was a shareholder of the Great Western Railway company, a fact Ranger was not aware of when he took the contract. The case was eventually settled by the Lord Cranworth, who stated that Ranger could not reject terms of the contract.

In 1945, she was converted to an internal combustion engine repair ship and redesignated ARG-20. Decommissioned in 1946, she was scrapped in 1970. Construction The ship was laid down under Maritime Commission (MC) Contract 3 June 1940 by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Kearny, New Jersey, MC hull 70, yard hull 175, and launched as Fred Morris on 2 November 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Fred Allain Morris. Fred Morris, official number 240200, was the fourth in a series of five identical ships (Joseph Lykes, Zoella Lykes, Reuben Tipton (Torpedoed/lost 1942), Fred Morris, and John Lykes) built for Lykes Brothers Steamship Company of New Orleans and delivered to the company on 27 December 1940 after successful trials for the MC and Lykes. The ship was intended for service between the U.S. Gulf ports and ports in United Kingdom and Mediterranean. To meet requirements for river and canal navigation modifications were made for visibility on the bridge and masts were telescopic to meet Manchester ship canal height requirements. The ship was designed to accommodate a crew of eighteen deck department, sixteen engine department and nine in the steward's department for a total of forty-three crew with two owner's staterooms approximating liner cabins suitable for passengers. Characteristics as built were length overall, length between perpendiculars, beam (molded), loaded draft, , , with a displacement of 12,875 tons. Propulsion was a De Laval steam turbine driving a bronze, variable-pitch, three-bladed propeller in diameter. Two 250 kW De Laval steam turbine generators provided electrical power. The launch can be seen in stock footage used in the opening scenes of the 1964 film The Incredible Mr. Limpet. Navy acquisition The Fred Morris was acquired by the Navy on 1 March 1941 and commissioned as USS Otus (AS–20) on 19 March 1941 with Commander Joel Newsom in command. The lone ship in her class, she was named for Otus, a mythological son of Iphimedia (wife of Aloeus) and Poseidon. Submarine tender (1941-1945) Assigned to the Asiatic Fleet as a submarine tender, she was anchored in Mariveles Bay, Philippine Islands, on 7 December 1941. On 10 December 1941 she was slightly damaged during the Japanese air raid on the Cavite Navy Yard, when several bombs landed near her starboard side. Not wanting to risk one of the few tenders in his command, Admiral Hart, Commander Asiatic Fleet ordered Otus to leave the Philippines. Departing 10 December she arrived at Port Darwin, Australia on 28 December. Remaining at Port Darwin through January 1942 Otus steamed to Java and Trincomalee, Ceylon, during February and the first part of March. She returned to Australia on 10 March, where she tended submarines at Fremantle until departing for the United States on 25 July. Arriving Mare Island Naval Shipyard 24 August, Otus underwent an extensive overhaul until 23 January 1943. After a brief stop at Pearl Harbor she returned to Australia 22 February where she remained, steaming from port to port as the demand for her services dictated, until 1 September. From September 1943 until December 1944 Otus served at four different sites in New Guinea furnishing tender services for escort vessels, minecraft, and amphibious craft as well as submarines. Departing Hollandia Bay 25 December, Otus arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, Philippines on 6 January 1945 and commenced providing routine upkeep and emergency repairs to the ships of the Southwest Pacific Area. Repair ship (1945-1946) On 25 June 1945 her classification was changed to ARG–20 (Repair Ship, Internal Combustion Engines). On 1 December 1945 Otus left San Pedro Bay en route to Portland, Oregon. Arriving 2 January 1946, she was assigned the duty of deactivating vessels. She carried out this work at both Portland and Astoria until 29 June 1946, when she steamed to Seattle to commence inactivation overhaul. Decommissioning and fate Otus decommissioned 20 August 1946 and was sold the following day. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 25 September 1946. In 1970 she was at Olympia, Washington with the National Defense Reserve Fleet. The ship was finally sold for scrap, 2 November 1970, to Zidell Explorations Inc. of Portland, OR. Otus received one battle star for service in World War II.

The nationalists have combined this campaign with the Battle of Siping as part of the battle, but this was rather misleading since the strategies for both sides were totally different from the strategies in this campaign and unrelated to each other, furthermore, the commanders for both sides in this campaign were completely different from the Battle of Siping. More importantly, the nationalists in the Battle of Siping was in name only, because they were former nationalists (mostly warlords ostensively under nationalist reign) turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after World War II, and the local bandits recruited by the nationalist administrators to fight off communists, since Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist regime simply did not have the resource to rapidly deploy his forces into the region. In fact, in the Battle of Siping, Chiang's own force did not even participated in the fights. This campaign was characterized by the fact that the supreme commanders of both sides had overestimated their strength and set unrealistic goals that could doom their troops in the field, but in both cases, the brilliant frontline commanders on both sides had successfully averted the potential catastrophes by convincing their respective supreme commanders to change their original decisions. Prelude After the defeat of Jinjiatun Campaign, the nationalists resumed their offensive with vengeance. In a short period of just two days, the nationalists were able to regroup and re-supply completely, and continued their push toward Siping. Chiang Kai-shek was determined to take Changchun after taking Siping, and Mao Zedong was equally determined to hold Siping to the end and prevent the nationalists from taking both Siping and Changchun. Both sides realized the upcoming campaign would be a difficult one and both sides placed one of their best field commanders in charge: Du Yuming for the nationalists and Lin Biao for the communists. Order of battle Attackers: nationalist order of battle: *New 1st Army *New 6th Army *71st Army *93rd Army *Army-sized 207th Division of the Youth Army Defenders: communist order of battle: * Wan Yi (万毅) Column *Southern Manchurian 3rd Column *Western Manchurian 3rd Division *Northern Manchurian 7th Division *Shandong 1st Division *Shandong 2nd Division *Shandong 3rd Division *3rd Division of the New Fourth Army *8th Brigade of the New Fourth Army *359th Brigade First stage Under Mao Zedong's strategy, the communists were determined to hold Siping to the end. In order to fortify the city, everyone was mobilized to build bunkers inside the city, while food, ammunition and other supplies were stacked. Lin Biao and Mao Zedong had personally inspected communist fortifications at important defensive positions such as Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, 塔子山) and Three Lines of Groves (San Dao Lin Zi, 三道林子) with Peng Zhen in preparation for a prolonged campaign. Lin Biao also held a conference at Pear Tree (Li Shu, 梨树) county to plan the strategy of the defense: To better coordinate the defense of Siping, the communist formed an urban defense command inside the city headed by the Ma Renxing (马仁兴), the commander of the communist 1st Brigade, while the general headquarters retreated to the suburb at Pear Tree (Li Shu, 梨树) county. In order to boost the morale of defenders, a newspaper titled \\"Self Defense Newspaper\\" was created with Chen Yi (陈沂), the deputy director of the political directorate of the communist general headquarters as the chief editor. The communist decided to deploy only two regiments in the city to check the nationalist attacks while the bulk of their force would be deployed in the rear, in the region between Siping and Pear Tree (Li Shu, 梨树) county and the region between Siping and the Eight Sided City (Ba Mian Cheng, 八面城). Once the attacking nationalists were checked by the defensive force of the city in fortification, the communists would then concentrate their force to strike the weakest nationalist 71st Army. On April 17, 1946, nationalist frontline commander Zheng Dongguo (郑洞国) and his deputy Liang Huasheng (梁华盛) moved their headquarters to Twin Temples (Shuang Miao Zi, 双庙子) and ordered an immediate attack on the city. On April 18, the railways reaching the city was successfully severed. Two regiments of the 30th Division of the nationalist 71st Army under the command of Chen Mingren (陈明仁) attacked the enemy positions from the south from Haifeng Village (Haifeng Tun, 海丰屯), Pobozi (泊脖子), and Duck Lake Pao (Ya Hu Pao, 鸭湖泡) regions, but were beaten back three times consecutively. After the initial setback, Zheng Dongguo (郑洞国) held a military conference on April 19. The nationalist army and divisional commanders attending the conference concluded that the frontal attack on the strongly defended enemy positions was impossible, and attacks from flanks or other weak points must be selected instead in order to achieve a successful breakthrough. The railway junctions that provided the link between the 3rd Battalion of the communist 1st Regiment and the communist 56th Regiment appeared to be a good point for the breakthrough. After the conference, under heavy artillery cover, the 30th Division of the nationalist New 1st Army launched its offensive on the junction of the two communist units, and the nationalists had successfully taken the enemy position as expected. The loss of the position at the railway junction signaled that the defensive force inside the city must be strengthened and Lin Biao immediately did so, and informed the defenders in the city. The arrival of the reinforcements greatly boosted the morale of the defenders and the advance guard of the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division launched a counterassault on the nationalists with the help of other communist units, and successfully took back the positions at railway junction previously lost on the same afternoon, while inflicting heavy casualties on the nationalists in the process, and the heavy casualties stopped the offensive of the nationalist 30th Division completely. After the struggle for Siping had begun, both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in their distant headquarters were concerned about the development and both frequently inquired the progress on the battlefield. Chiang was determined to take Changchun and thus Siping must be taken first to open the path for Changchun, while Mao felt that Siping must be held at all cost and on April 22, Mao telegraphed Lin Biao to order him to hold on and wait for the campaign to turn for the better. From April 18, through April 26, 3 divisions from the nationalist New 1st Army and the 71st Army took turns to assault the enemy positions, but were all beaten back by the enemy in favorable terrain. By the evening of April 26, 1946, heavy casualties forced the offensive of the nationalist 71st Army to a complete stop, while that of the nationalist New 1st Army was reduced to skirmishes. After failing to make significant progress, the nationalists resorted to artillery to shell the enemy, but this resulted in a disastrous failure. The terrain favored the defenders in that there were relatively few artillery positions outside the city for shelling the city, and defenders were well aware these positions. The nationalists enjoyed numerical superiorities in artillery so these positions were jammed with nationalist batteries. The enemy defending the city, on the other hand, had fewer artilleries and thus was forced to move around whenever and wherever they were needed, and such frequent and rapid movement to the next new position where artillery support was needed helped the enemy artilleries from being shelled by the nationalist counter-artillery fire. In contrast, nationalist artillery was the first to fire for most of the time, but after firing, they were not able to move around due to limited positions available and the high concentration of batteries deployed in the few available positions. As a result, the nationalist batteries became victims of enemy counter-artillery fire and suffered great loss. When nationalists were forced to withdraw their batteries from the few available artillery positions to avoid losses, the enemy was out of range. As a result, the attacking nationalists lost the artillery duel. Mao was happy that the nationalist attack was beaten back again, and on April 27, 1946, telegraphed Lin Biao to praise him and his troop, and asked Lin Biao to deploy one or two more regiments to develop Siping into Madrid in the East. Second stage To better defend the city, Lin Biao redeployed his forces: the 21st Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the communist Western Manchurian 3rd Division, the 67th Regiment and the 2nd Regiment of the Artillery Brigade of the Northern Manchurian 7th Division entered the city to boost the defense, the 55th Regiment and the 58th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the communist Wan Yi (万毅) Column was deployed in southern suburb, the Shandong 1st Division and 2nd Division were deployed in the northwestern suburb, the 7th Brigade and the 10th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division were deployed in the eastern suburb, and 359th Brigade stationed at Gongzhuling as reserve. The 7th Brigade and the 8th Brigade of the communist Southern Manchurian 3rd Column had also successfully severed the nationalist supply line between Changtu and Kaiyuan, Liaoning, thus slowed down the nationalist push on the city. To distract nationalist forces elsewhere and preventing them from reinforcing their comrades-in-arms attacking Siping, other communist units launched separate attacks on the nationalist positions, and by April 18, all of the final nationalist strongholds in Changchun region fell into the enemy hands, and on April 25, Qiqihar fell into the enemy hands, and finally on April 28, all of the final nationalist strongholds in the Harbin region fell into the enemy hands. However, such success only strengthened Chiang Kai-shek's resolve to take Changchun after Siping. After the initial success of repelling the nationalist attack, the communist high command became overconfident and daydreamed that within ten days, the communist defenders of Siping would leave the city and annihilate the elite nationalist New 1st Army. On April 28, 1946, the communist high command telegraphed the entire communist force defending the city by praising them for their success in defending Siping and hoped that they would continue their effort for the final victory, turning Siping into another Madrid. Lin Biao was well aware that the communist force at the time was not capable of fighting with the New 1st Army face to face, and telegraphed back on April 29, claiming that it was impossible to annihilate the New 1st Army at Siping, though this elite nationalist force would definitely be annihilated in Northeast China, it was not the time when defending Siping. However, the unscathed large communist force in other areas was quite capable of badly mauling the exhausted New 1st Army after the fierce battles at Siping in an ambush at the favorable terrain and under the cover of darkness and bad weather, and such ambush was planned later on the presumed nationalist attack on Changchun. Du Yuming, the brilliant nationalist commander would not provide the enemy with such opportunity they wanted and thus would consequently foil the enemy's hope by successfully convincing Chiang Kai-shek instead of immediately continuing to take Changchun after taking Siping as originally planned, the exhausted nationalists would stop at Siping regroup and re-supply, hence avoiding any possible ambush or counterattacks by the enemy. Confident that the nationalists would be able to completely annihilate the communist enemy and would be able to first take Northeast China and then the entire China afterward, on April 30, 1946, Chiang Kai-shek turned down George Marshall's peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties in China, and both the nationalists and the communists realized that any gains in the following peace negotiations would come from the victories in the battlefield. On April 1, Mao Zedong telegrammed Lin Biao, giving the latter the following orders: First, Lin Biao would have the overall control of the communist political and military power in Northeast China and if help was needed, Gao Gang would be sent. Second, the nationalists had turned down the George Marshall's peace proposal that was agreed by the communists and neutral political parties and insisted on taking Changchun, so Siping and Benxi must be held to the end so that the enemy (nationalists) would exhaust its supplies and ammunitions to the point that it would take at least six months to resupply, and thus providing time for us (communists) to strengthen ourselves (communists) at Changchun and Harbin for better positions in the peace negotiation followed. Third, concentrating our (communist) force to achieve victory. After setbacks outside Siping, the nationalists believed that the situation in Northeast China depended on the successful capture of the city, and after Siping was taken from the enemy, the overall situation for the nationalist in Northeast China would immediately be improved significantly, and thus the city must be taken at all costs. The elite nationalist New 6th Army under the command of Liao Yaoxiang (廖耀湘) was first airlifted by the United States Army Air Forces to Northeast China, and made its move to Siping from Kaiyuan, Liaoning, Xifeng County, Liaoning, and the Town of Yehe Nara (Ye He Zhen, 叶赫镇). With the arrival of new reinforcements, the nationalists planned to concentrate their forces to take Siping and then take the city of Eternal Auspiciousness (Yong Ji, 永吉) and Changchun. In preparation, the 14th Division and the 22nd Division of the nationalist New 6th Army was deployed to Kaiyuan, Liaoning from Liaoyang and Benxi, the nationalist 93rd Army was also deployed to Northeast China from Beijing. In addition, the nationalist air force concentrated all of its available aircraft in the region to support the offensive on the ground. Third stage On May 15, Du Yuming gave the order to launch a general assault on Siping and declared to his men that the city must be taken this time. The nationalist assault came in three fronts: the 88th Division and the New 6th Army of the nationalist right front would attack the enemy's left flank, targeting cities including Gongzhuling, Meihekou, Changchun and Qitamu (其塔木). The New 1st Army on the nationalist central front would directly attack city and then would take Shuangcheng and Dehui after taking Siping, and continue its push to the regions north of the Songhua River. Two divisions of the 71st Army on the nationalist left front would attack the enemy's right flank, targeting Zheng Family's Village (Zheng Jia Tun, 郑家屯) and Shuangcheng. On May 15, 1946, with ten times numerical superiority and additional technical superiority, the nationalist 50th Division at the left flank of the nationalist central front launched its fierce attacks under air cover and air support on the peak # 258 held by the enemy, located to the east of Siping and south of Hafu (哈福). After severe casualties, the enemy was forced to give up peak # 258. On May 17, Du Yuming ordered the nationalist 195th Division in reserve into action and soon took Hafu (哈福), and surrounded the most critical point of defense of the city, the highest point in the east, a hill called Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, 塔子山) located 10 km to the southeast of the city. Excited about the progress, Du reported to Chiang Kai-shek that Siping would be taken soon. Chiang, on the other hands, was not so sure and worried that the nationalist offensive would once more suffer a setback, sent the nationalist Deputy Chief of the General Staff Bai Chongxi to Northeast China to investigate. The night Bai reached Shenyang, Bai told Du Yuming that Chiang had felt the battle to capture Siping took too long, and he could not wait any longer. As long as Siping was captured, the nationalists would be in a better position on the peace negotiation table than the communists and taking Changchun would be after taking Siping. Both sides were well aware of the importance of the hill and the nationalists launched multiple assaults on the hill, and all were beaten back by the communist 19th Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the Western Manchurian 3rd Division defending the hill. The nationalists then concentrated all available firepower to bombard the enemy position with an area around a hundred square metres at the hilltop at a rate of more than 30 rounds per minute, and under the cover of intense artillery shelling, the nationalist New 6th Army under its commander Liao Yaoxiang (廖耀湘) attacked the hill from three sides in the east, the south, and the west. After beating back the nationalist attacks for six times, it was obvious reinforcements were needed. The communist 10th Brigade was ordered to reinforce Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, 塔子山) but they were delayed when crossing the Liao River, and this was the most important reason that caused the eventual abandonment of city. It was obvious that it would be only a matter of time before the communist stronghold at Pagoda Mountain (Ta Zi Shan, 塔子山) would be taken by the attacking nationalists, and with neither the technical nor the numerical superiority, Lin Biao believed it was much more important to preserve the communist strength for the future and he radioed Mao Zedong on May 18, to report the situation and intention to abandon the city. After sending the message, Lin Biao ordered a general withdraw without waiting for the Mao's reply, and by midnight, the general withdrawal in was completed in an orderly fashion and in total secrecy. Next morning, the nationalists entered and secured the city, and only after that did Mao's reply came on May 19, in which Mao finally changed his mind and agreed with Lin Biao. Had Lin Biao waited, his entire force in the city would be annihilated. Outcome The brilliance of the frontline commanders from both sides was obvious towards the end and after the campaign. Chiang Kai-shek was overjoyed with the taking of Siping and ordered the nationalists to immediately continue their attack and to take Changchun without a break, so that the enemy would not have the chance to regroup. Du Yuming, the nationalist frontline commander was well aware that his exhausted force must rest and regroup for sometime before launching anymore attacks on the enemy. Furthermore, Du and his fellow officers were also keenly aware that the majority of the enemy force in the rural regions was unscathed and was waiting to ambush them out in the open if the exhausted nationalists had ventured into the terrain hostile to the mechanized force. Du and his officers were determined not to give the enemy the opportunity they had been waiting for, and in a rare example among Chiang's most trusted subordinates, Du Yuming refused to carry out Chiang's order and successfully convinced Chiang to stop the planned offensive to allow the nationalists to consolidate their gains in Northeast China, and thus foiled the enemy's hope of possible ambush. Equally brilliant, the communist commander Lin Biao dared to ignore Mao Zedong's order and withdrew from the city on his own, thus successfully avoided total annihilation of his defending force by the numerically and technically superior adversary. However, Lin Biao was more fortunate than his counterpart in that he did not have to convince Mao for his decision and actions because Mao had realized his error and concurred with what Lin Biao's had done. However, neither Chiang's original plan of continuing to take Changchun nor Mao's original plan of holding Siping had materialized and thus the campaign ended in a stalemate.

It was released in 1966 as a double LP on the Musicor Records label, and was available exclusively through the Columbia Record Club. Background Although Country Heart contained several hits Jones had scored with Musicor, it is not actually a greatest hits collection. It includes a rerecording of Jones's first number one country hit \\"White Lightnin'\\" as well as a remake of his hit duet \\"We Must Have Been Out Of Our Minds\\" with Melba Montgomery from 1963. Curiously, the album also features an instrumental version of \\"The Race Is On\\", which had gone to number three for Jones in 1964 when he was still with United Artists. Country Heart also showcases the songwriting talents of Jones friend Earl \\"Peanut\\" Montgomery, whom the country star had begun to rely on more heavily for new material. \\"From Here To The Door\\" was written by Don Chapel, who was married to Tammy Wynette at the time. \\"Walk Through This World with Me\\" would become a number one hit for Jones in 1967, his first chart topper in five years. According to Bob Allen's book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Jones was less than enthusiastic about the \\"musically middle-of-the-road love ballad that was almost inspirational in its unabashedly optimistic and romantic sentiments - a far cry from 'The Window Up Above,'\\" and it was only at his producer H.W. \\"Pappy\\" Daily's insistence that he recorded the song at all. \\"Four-O-Thirty Three\\" and \\"Things Have Gone To Pieces\\" had also been top ten hits for Jones.

It flows from Lac Saint-Luson through Lac Bienville west to Hudson Bay. While lower section of the river (after Lac Bienville) has very powerful current, with many waterfalls (up to or in height) and rapids, upper section consists of series of lakes interconnected by steep rapids and ledges. Great Whale River has also the branch originating from Caniapiscau Reservoir. For canoeists, this is the easiest access (bridge on Trans-Taiga Road at Lac Montausier ). Both the northern village of Kuujjuarapik, whose inhabitants are mostly Inuit, and the Cree village of Whapmagoostui are situated at the mouth of the river, near the site of the former RCAF Station Great Whale River. The villages were formerly known collectively as \\"Great Whale River\\" and \\"Poste-de-la-Baleine.\\" The portion between Lake Bienville and the mouth of the Coats River has also been called Abchigamich River, but this name was dropped in 1946 by the Commission de géographie du Québec. Also, the name has often been wrongly translated into French as Rivière de la Grande Baleine (not until 1962 did the Commission de géographie du Québec officially adopt the current Grande rivière de la Baleine). History A preliminary camp on the Great Whale River of the Révillon Frères company, 1922 The Great Whale River was a place favored by the Cree and Inuit for hunting beluga long before the arrival of Europeans. Even though both were nomadic, the mouth of the river was often an encampment site and served as unofficial border. The name of the river was recorded in 1744 in the logbooks of Hudson's Bay Company employees Thomas Mitchell and John Longland, while exploring the bay's coast. The entry for July 25 made the first mention of the \\"Great White Whail River\\". It may have come from the Cree Whapmagoostui, meaning River of the Whale, and referring to the hunting of white whale or beluga there. In the early 1970s, the state-owned power utility Hydro-Québec planned to construct three hydroelectric power stations on the Great Whale River as a part of the James Bay Project.James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, ch. 8.1.3, pp. 114-115. Although detailed planning for the project was only begun in 1986, opposition from Crees, Inuit, environmental organizations like Greenpeace and the Friends of the Earth and other activists led the Premier of Quebec, Jacques Parizeau, to announce in November 1994, that the project was suspended indefinitely. However, the project may still be revived in the future.

The T-JTA is a revision by Robert M. Taylor and Lucile P. Morrison of the Johnson Temperament Analysis (JTA) developed by Dr. Roswell H. Johnson in 1941. The T-JTA was designed to measure personality variables or attitudes and behavioral tendencies that are claimed by the test's authors to influence personal, social, marital, parental, family, scholastic, and vocational adjustment. The Taylor-Johnson Temperament Analysis and its acronym are registered trademarks of its publisher, Psychological Publications, Inc.  Historical Development  The Taylor-Johnson Temperament Analysis (T-JTA) is a complete revision of the Johnson Temperament Analysis (JTA). The JTA was developed by Roswell H. Johnson, Ph.D., who served as a director at the American Institute of Family Relations in Los Angeles from 1935 until his retirement in 1960. The JTA was published in 1941, and in addition to its general use as a personality test, it was used extensively in premarital and marital counseling. During the early years of its development, the JTA was administered at the American Institute of Family Relations to men and women who sought counseling for personal or interpersonal problems, or who volunteered to take part in Dr. Johnson's continuing research. It was estimated by Donald P. Wilson, Ph.D., Director of Research at the Institute, that following the test's publication, from 1941 to 1962, at least 70,000 different individuals took the test at that counseling center alone. At the request of Dr. Johnson, his associates at the Institute, Robert M. Taylor, Director of Counseling, and Lucile P. Morrison, staff counselor, undertook a revision in 1963. In 1966 the Taylor-Johnson Temperament Analysis (T-JTA) was first published.  About the T-JTA  The Taylor-Johnson Temperament Analysis measures 9 personality traits and their polar opposites. * Nervous ↔ Composed * Depressive ↔ Lighthearted * Active-Social ↔ Quiet * Expressive-Responsive ↔ Inhibited * Sympathetic ↔ Indifferent * Subjective ↔ Objective * Dominant ↔ Submissive * Hostile ↔ Tolerant * Self-Disciplined ↔ Impulsive The test consists of 180 questions equally divided among the nine bipolar traits measured by the test.

The attack The first reports from the region suspected the use of Scud missiles (SS-1).60 dead as Russian missiles hit Grozny, The Independent, October 22, 1999 The hypersonic missiles, ten in number according to Chechen officials (other sources reported less), fell without warning, as the Chechen air defense systems have been destroyed in the earlier Russian air strikes. The explosions occurred at around 18:15 hours in several areas of the capital, mostly in the downtown area including the crowded, central outdoor marketplace. Two of the missiles exploded outside the city's only functioning maternity hospital, which was located near Aslan Maskhadov's presidential palace building (the palace itself was not damaged in the attack), and near the city's main post office.Russian rockets hit Grozny market, The Guardian, October 22, 1999 Another missile hit the mosque in the village of Kalinina, a suburb of Grozny.Russians at odds over market attack, BBC News, October 22, 1999 According to official Chechen sources, about 30–35 people died at the hospital; a correspondent for the AFP counted 27 bodies, most of them women and newborn babies.World: Europe: Rockets blast Grozny, BBC News, October 21, 1999 Most of the casualties from the post office strike seemed to have been people waiting for public transport outside the building, as several buses were at the stop at the moment of the explosion. In the Kalinina mosque, some 41 people who had gathered for evening prayer were said to have been killed.Open Letter to the United Nations from the Secretary General of Amnesty International, Amnesty International, November 2, 1999 Most of the casualties occurred at the central market, which was filled with hundreds of shoppers at the time of the attack. The victims were not limited to Chechens, but included also many ethnic Russians and others. A rain of large ball-shaped shrapnel from the cluster munition airbursts showered the market, nearby streets, and open-air cafés, with each blast affecting a large area. According to an investigation by Human Rights Watch, the first explosion hit a building about northeast of the bazaar at the corner of the city's main Prospekt Svobody and Mira streets, and adjacent to a city bus caught in traffic. However, most of the marketplace deaths came from the second and third explosions, which occurred within 100 yards of each other in the central bazaar area, \\"near the flowers and confectionery stalls.\\" According to the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky, the worst hit area was the so-called kolkhoz sector of the market, located near the building of the Chechen military headquarters. Reuters reporter Maria Eismont counted at least 90 bodies on the scene, while the local AFP correspondent said he witnessed 17 corpses recovered from the market. Some time afterwards, another missile fell about 200 meters from the bazaar, claiming the life of Supian Ependiyev, the first journalist to be killed while covering the Second Chechen War.Correspondent killed in Grozny rocket attack, Committee to Protect Journalists, November 5, 1999 Aftermath Many of the blasts' victims were brought to the central Grozny hospital, where doctors operated without electricity. Some of the hundreds of injured, about 100 of them in a critical state, were immediately evacuated across the border to the neighboring republic of Ingushetia that same night. Others were taken across one or two days later, and ambulances faced lengthy delays at roadblocks when the Russian troops attempted to seal the border. The attacks unleashed widespread panic in Grozny and a new wave of thousands of refugees headed for Ingushetia.Blasts in Chechen Capital Unleash New Wave of Refugees, The New York Times, October 23, 1999 More than 177,000 refugees had already fled the fighting. Russia closed the border; one of the refugee convoys from Grozny was bombed after being turned back. The city's streets were reported to be largely empty after the attack, as those residents who had not yet fled were too scared to venture outside.World: Europe: Russia tightens noose around Grozny, BBC News, October 23, 1999 Two weeks later, Chechen separatist officials gave an updated death toll of more than 280 people.Chechens Believe Russia’s Aim Is to Obliterate Nation, Los Angeles Times, November 07, 1999 There were further reports of tactical missiles being used on Grozny as the Russian Ground Forces were besieging and shelling the city.World: Europe: Russia pounds Grozny, BBC News, November 7, 1999 For example, in an attack on October 27–28, the homes of field commanders Shamil Basayev and Arbi Barayev and of the former acting president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev were destroyed, as were numerous civilian buildings (at least five multi-flat houses, one five-storied apartment building and many smaller houses) and a busy taxi parking.War Crimes and Human Rights Violations in Chechnya , Oleg Orlov of Memorial, May 26, 2000 Basayev himself said that he had created a special unit of suicide fighters to carry out \\"acts of sabotage\\" in retaliation for the market attack.RFE/RL NEWSLINE Vol. 3, No. 211, Part I, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 29 October 1999 Basayev and the formation, named Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs, took responsibility for a series of suicide bombing and mass hostage taking incidents over the next five years, culminating in the disastrous Beslan school hostage crisis in September 2004 that claimed more than 300 victims. Responsibility for the attack and the question of its legality The attack was met with an official denial on the part of the Russian authorities, who insisted that no civilians died in the blasts and provided a number of widely varying and conflicting alternative explanations.Putin contradicts Russian army spokesman on Chechen explosions; Many dead, wounded in Grozny blasts , CNN, October 22, 1999 Despite an early admission by Aleksandr Veklich, a Russian military spokesman in the region, that the market (Russian officials typically characterised the marketplace as \\"an ammunition market\\" and \\"terrorist headquarters\\") was destroyed in a \\"special operation in which no artillery or aircraft were involved\\", Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin claimed that the explosions were the results of a \\"clash between gangs\\" and denied information that the Russian forces were involved in any way in the events in Grozny.Russia denies deadly attack on Grozny, CBS, November 10, 2000 In this version, Putin was joined by the army general Vladislav Putilin, who was quoted as saying that \\"the military forces have nothing to do with that affair\\". Another official, the chief of the Center of Public Relations of the FSB, Aleksandr Zdanovitch, alleged a self- explosion of the ammunition stored there \\"because the terrorists thought there would be no air or artillery strikes at the place of large concentrations of people\\". In another conflicting version, provided by the First Deputy Chief of the Russian General Staff of the Armed Forces, General Valery Manilov spoke about \\"a rapid special operation, independent of the regular armed forces\\" that \\"resulted in a conflict between two large bandit groups which had been enemies for a long time\\". This confrontation supposedly led to an accidental explosion of \\"one large ammunition depot\\" during the alleged fighting in that area. Later, some Russian officials actually suggested \\"a terrorist act prepared by the terrorists themselves\\" and the press office of the Russian Defense Ministry even called anyone who blamed Russia for the massacre \\"a liar\\", accusing the reporters at the scene of \\"misleading international public opinion\\". According to a report by the Russian human rights organization Memorial who had analyzed the television footage of the aftermath, an explosion of \\"one or several compact powerful explosive mechanisms\\" at ground level in this case is out of the question, as all the vertical elements in the rows of stalls remained standing, while the horizontal ones (tents and overhead covers) were destroyed and broken. In addition, those who were not protected by overhead cover received multiple fragmentation wounds, and the foreground showed the characteristic traces of cassette (cluster) ammunition of so-called \\"ball bombs\\" (munitions used in the Tochka missile warheads and intended for destruction of non-protected live forces in large areas). Finally, apparent fragments of \\"enormous\\" ground-to-ground missiles and cluster sub-munition canisters were found at the scene (as reported by Babitsky). There were also reports in the Russian media on the use of cassette tactical missiles against \\"terrorists\\" in Chechnya earlier that month, which were corroborated by the refugees. \\"The mosque and the maternity home, about which the Russian officials have chosen to keep silent, are undoubtedly civil objects, the attack of which is explicitly prohibited,\\" Memorial added.THE MISSILE BOMBING OF GROZNY, OCTOBER 21 1999 , Memorial, 26 October 1999 According to Human Rights Watch, the possibility of arms merchants or military installations in the bazaar did not justify \\"the tremendous amount of force\\" used against the market in a strike which may have been illegal. In its report titled Evidence of War Crimes in Chechnya, the watchdog concluded: \\"Although there is some evidence that there may have been legitimate military targets located near or within the Grozny bazaar, the size and extent of the blasts, combined with the large number of noncombatants in the immediate vicinity, strongly suggests that the Russian attack was grossly disproportionate. If Chechen commander Shamil Basayev did indeed situate his headquarters within the Grozny market, that too would be a serious abuse of international law. Although Chechen fighters are not parties to the Geneva Conventions, as individuals within the territory of a state party [Russia], they are bound to respect the basic precept of civilian immunity. Human Rights Watch calls upon Chechen commanders to immediately redeploy their troops, headquarters, and weapons storage facilities out of populated areas.\\"Evidence of War Crimes in Chechnya, Human Rights Watch, November 3, 1999 According to the HALO Trust, \\"Grozny market ... is a great sprawling area of wooden stalls laid out each morning and packed away in the evenings. It is the equivalent of all your department stores rolled into one. Thus you can buy fresh bread, a TV set, a wedding dress, a bag of nails, and an AK-47 in one open area the size of a couple of sports fields. Each section is clearly marked and the area where weapons are sold is very small and set right against the edge. The center of destruction was some 150 m away from the area set aside for selling weapons. It was right over the clothes and food section. With the use of such munitions in such an area it was impossible not to have foreseen massive collateral damage. A study by the Foreign Military Studies Office evaluated: \\"In a surprising and threatening move, the federal forces relied heavily on fuel-air explosives and tactical missiles (SCUD and SCARAB). (...) Such strikes were designed for maximum psychological pressure—to demonstrate the hopelessness of further resistance against a foe that could strike with impunity and that was invulnerable to countermeasures.\\"Grozny 2000: Urban Combat Lessons Learned , Foreign Military Studies Office, July–August 2000 Major General Vladimir Shamanov, Russia's commander in Chechnya, said the decision to attack was made at the highest level (\\"the very top\\" and \\"the highest chief\\"), meaning at least knowledge by Vladimir Putin and President Yeltsin. The same opinion was voiced by the president of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev.CHECHNYA: FOR THE MOTHERLAND Reported grave breaches of international humanitarian law , Amnesty International, December 1, 1999 According to Aushev, a retired Red Army general and a veteran of the Soviet–Afghan War, in all probability the missiles had been fired from the base of the 58th Army near the village of Tarskoye in North Ossetia. World reaction The President of the European Parliament, Lord Russell-Johnston, expressed shock at the death toll and accused the Russian government of human rights violations and lawbreaking. The President of the European Union, Paavo Lipponen of Finland, said the group was \\"deeply worried about the deteriorating situation\\" in Chechnya. Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder condemned the \\"massacre on the Grozny marketplace,\\" and German politicians urged sanctions against Russia.Chechnya: Two Russian warplanes shot down, The Associated Press, October 24, 1999 European leaders also demanded Putin put forward a plan to end the war in Chechnya. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a statement in which he expressed his \\"strong hope that special care is taken to avoid innocent civilian casualties in the current conflict and that the provisions of humanitarian law in armed conflict are respected.\\"Russia under pressure over Chechnya, BBC News, October 22, 1999 The White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that there were \\"conflicting reports and statements\\" about the blasts, but \\"what's clear is that there's a tragic situation there with terrible loss of life.\\" U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the incident \\"deplorable and ominous\\" and said that the Russians should have learnt in their previous war in Chechnya that \\"this kind of violence is not a solution\\". Amnesty International declared that \\"even assuming that these weapons [being sold at several stalls in one corner of the market] were indeed the target of the attack, the use by Russian forces of high explosive weapons in a market place crowded with civilians suggests that this attack may have been indiscriminate within the meaning of Article 51 of Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions, to which the Russian Federation is a party, and therefore a grave breach of this Protocol.\\" Regarding this and other incidents of civilian casualties in Chechnya, the organization called on Russia to: > comply with the provisions of international humanitarian law prohibiting > indiscriminate attacks and direct attacks on civilians and civilian objects, > and should therefore immediately desist from carrying out any such attacks > in the context of its military offensive in Chechnya [and] take sufficient > precautions to protect civilians. In addition to selecting and vetting > targets for their genuine military significance, it should give civilians > effective advance warning of its attacks - \\"unless circumstances do not > permit\\" - in compliance with international humanitarian law. Other rules > require specific precautions to be taken when launching attacks, including > desisting from an attack if it becomes apparent that the objective is not a > military one, or the attack risks being disproportionate to the military > objective. (...) The Russian authorities should hold comprehensive and > impartial investigations into alleged abuses of international humanitarian > law such as direct attacks on civilians and civilian objects, including > hospitals and medical vehicles, which have been reported to have occurred in > the course of their military offensive in Chechnya. The government should > bring all military and government officials responsible for such violations > to justice. The Russian government should grant immediately safe access to > Chechnya to a team of international investigators to conduct independent > investigation into allegations of violations of international humanitarian > law, to establish the truth and to identify those responsible. The Committee to Protect Journalists protested the death of Supian Ependiyev in an open letter to President Yeltsin, while Human Rights Watch said the assault \\"may have been a serious violation of the laws of war\\" and urged the Russian authorities to vigorously investigate the incident and publish their findings.

It is also known as Arno's Castle. History It was built in 1745—55 as a folly in the form of a castle which incorporated office spaces and recreation rooms, but may have originally been a stable block and laundry for the lord of the manor. The building was probably designed by either William Halfpenny or James Bridges, for the prominent local factory owner William Reeve of Mount Pleasant (now the Arno’s Court Hotel), from which it is separated by a major road junction. Reeve smelted brass and copper, and the Black Castle was built from blocks created from the waste slag. Description The Castle is built from pre-cast black copper-slag blocks from Reeve's foundry at Crew's Hole. Designed in Gothic Revival style, the building is symmetrical in plan with crenellated circular towers at each corner that link two-storey blocks to form a square courtyard. The front and back blocks have larger crenellated entrance towers with moulded archways through. Above the front arch is a blank panel with ogee head and a two-centre arch on the second storey with perpendicular tracery. The ranges to each side of the entrance have two windows with Y-tracery below a white string course and white carved inset panels. At the top of the ranges are light-coloured battlements with sunken panels. The front corner towers have external entrances with two-centred archways and above them are prominent white flushwork panels, some of which are in the shape of crosses while others mimic arrow slits. A coach house extends from the right- hand corner tower at right angles to the main structure. It has a central two- centre archway front and back with similar small windows on both sides. Above the string course are round flushwork panels and the crenellated parapet is raised above the entrance. Much of the freestone carving and dressings supposedly came from the city's demolished medieval gateways and St Werburghs Church, rebuilt by James Bridges in 1758—61. The building has been designated by Historic England as a Grade I-listed building. Arno's Court Triumphal Arch used to stand in front of the building, but was moved in 1912 to approximately 100 metres away.

Based on a biography by Myra Lewis and Murray M. Silver Jr., the screenplay is written by McBride and Jack Baran. The film is produced by Adam Fields, with executive producers credited as Michael Grais, Mark Victor, and Art Levinson. The early career of Jerry Lee Lewis, from his rise to rock and roll stardom to his controversial marriage to his 13-year-old cousin that led to his downfall, is depicted in the film. Until the scandal of the marriage depreciated his image, many had thought Lewis would supplant Elvis Presley as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" in the 1950s. Plot Jerry Lee Lewis (Quaid) plays piano (as opposed to a guitar like most other rock artists) during rock and roll's early years from 1956 to 1958. Jerry Lee is a man with many different sides: a skilled performer with little discipline, and an alcoholic. As Jerry Lee rises to the top of the charts with such hits as \\"Crazy Arms\\", \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On\\", and \\"Great Balls of Fire\\", he falls in love with Myra Gale Brown (Winona Ryder), the 13-year-old daughter of his first cousin (and bass player) J. W. Brown (John Doe), and eventually marries her (eloping to Mississippi), much to the anger and chagrin of her parents. A subplot deals with Jerry Lee's relationship with another cousin, (now-televangelist) Jimmy Swaggart (Alec Baldwin), who, during this period, was a struggling Pentecostal preacher. Jimmy's career kept him in constant conflict with his cousin's wild rock and roll career and brings out some uncomfortable exchanges between the two. The now-financially successful Jerry Lee buys a new car and gives it to his cousin, and when Jimmy praises the Lord for the gift, Jerry Lee replies, \\"Don't thank Jesus, thank Jerry Lee Lewis!\\" While Jerry Lee is touring in England in 1958, a British reporter discovers he is married to his teenage cousin. Jerry Lee is then condemned as a child molester and a pervert by the public. Jerry Lee is booed and ridiculed off stage at his opening concert; and as a result, his British tour is cancelled and he is deported from England. Confident that his career will remain a success, Jerry Lee is undaunted; however, the scandal follows him back to the States. Jerry Lee then begins drinking heavily when record sales and concert attendances are significantly down. He becomes furious when requested to print a public apology in Billboard and becomes increasingly abusive toward Myra. It was during one of these abusive episodes that Myra informs Jerry Lee that she is pregnant, and he collapses into Myra's arms, crying hysterically. In a last-ditch effort to improve his life, Jerry Lee, with Myra in tow, attends one of Swaggart's church services. During the altar call, Jimmy offers Jerry Lee one more chance to become saved and get right with God; but Jerry Lee again refuses, declaring, \\"If I'm going to hell, I'm going there playing the piano!\\" The caption preceding the closing credits reads, \\"Jerry Lee Lewis is playing his heart out somewhere in America tonight.\\" Cast * Dennis Quaid as Jerry Lee Lewis * Winona Ryder as Myra Gale Brown * John Doe as J.

Despite this, co-writer Silver was upset by the lack of accuracy in the film, claiming it was \\"phoney\\". Director Jim McBride admitted that it was never his intention to tie his film to the facts, and stated, \\"This movie does not represent itself in any way to be a historical documentary. We use the book as a jumping-off point.\\" Lewis has openly stated that he hates the film and the book it was based on. He did, however, praise Quaid's portrayal of him in the film, saying \\"he really pulled it off\\". Quaid even learned to play \\"Lewis-style\\" piano for the role. This was the final film of character actor Trey Wilson. He died at age forty from a cerebral hemorrhage in January 1989, prior to the film's release. Filming locations The film was shot on location in Marion, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, and West Memphis, Arkansas. Reception=Critical response Roger Ebert, film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, did not like the film because of its screenplay, and wrote, \\"This is a simpleminded rock 'n' roll history in which the pleasures are many and the troubles are few. Lewis, played by Dennis Quaid as a grinning simpleton with a crazy streak and a manic piano style, climbs the same career ladder as many of the stars of musical biographies, but he does it with lightning speed.\\" Ebert also said that Quaid did a nice job of reproducing Lewis' stage persona.Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun- Times, film review, June 30, 1989. Critic Caryn James wrote that the film portrays the fun side of rock and roll, and wrote, \\"Jim McBride's film is a compressed, cleaned-up version of the Jerry Lee Lewis story, but it re-creates the soul-shaking, brain-rattling fun of rock-and-roll. It also captures, perhaps for the first time on film, something of the sexual aura of rock-and- roll at its birth.\\" Yet, she added that anyone looking for a true sense of music history will be let down by the film.James, Caryn. The New York Times, film review, \\"'Goodness Gracious!' Jerry Lee Lewis,\\" June 30, 1989. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 63% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 24 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \\"Great Balls of Fire romanticizes the more disturbing elements of Jerry Lee Lewis' controversial life story, but Dennis Quaid's crackerjack performance and a soundtrack stuffed with classic songs gives this flawed biopic some smolder\\".Great Balls of Fire! at Rotten Tomatoes.

Ragghianti, a single mother and political appointee, was hounded for refusal to cooperate with the culture of corruption with which she found herself confronted. Two of Blanton's aides faced prosecution for their roles in the scandal. The film was based on the book Marie: A True Story by Peter Maas.

Pre-European history Chief Leschi of the Nisqually. Olympia is situated at the extreme southern tip of Puget Sound on Budd Inlet. The site of Olympia was home to Lushootseed-speaking peoples for thousands of years. The abundant shellfish in the tideflats and the many salmon-spawning streams entering Puget Sound at this point made it a productive food-gathering area. Many tribes shared access to these resources, including Squaxin, Nisqually, Puyallup, Chehalis, Suquamish, and Duwamish. According to early settlers' accounts, natives called the present site of Olympia \\"Cheet Woot\\" or \\"Schictwoot\\", meaning \\"the colplace of the bear.\\" European contact The first recorded visit by Europeans was in 1792 when Peter Puget and a crew from the British Vancouver Expedition charted the site. In 1833, the Hudson's Bay Company established Fort Nisqually, a trading post at Sequalitchew Creek near present-day DuPont, Washington. As the fur trade declined, the HBC diversified, forming a subsidiary called Pugets Sound Agricultural Company and converted former trade posts including Fort Nisqually into working farms. The U.S. Exploring Expedition under Lt. Charles Wilkes explored the Puget Sound region in 1841. They camped near Fort Nisqually while they charted the area and named Budd Inlet after expedition member Thomas A. Budd. Settlement The first known European to reside at the future site of Olympia was Thomas K Otchin, an English Hudson Bay Company employee who took up a claim in 1841 but abandoned it by 1842.\\"Portrait and Biographical Record of Portland and Vicinity, Oregon\\" Chicago: Chapman Publishing Co., 1903., 578. American settlers came to the area in the 1840s, drawn by the water-power potential of Tumwater Falls and established nearby \\"New Market,\\" now known as Tumwater, the first American settlement on Puget Sound. The site was the northern end of the \\"Cowlitz Portage,\\" the overland trail between the Cowlitz River and Puget Sound. In a time when water travel was the easiest form of transportation, Olympia's location on the north end of the main route through the area made it a crossroads for regional trade. In 1846 Edmund Sylvester and Levi Lathrop Smith jointly claimed the land that now comprises downtown Olympia. Smith built his cabin and enclosed two acres for a garden and livestock near the current intersection of Capitol Way and Olympia Avenue. In 1848 Smith was elected to the Oregon Provisional Legislature. In the same year, while canoeing to Tumwater, he had a seizure and died by drowning. His untimely death in 1848 left his partner and friend, Sylvester the sole owner of the land on which he platted the future townsite.Knox, Esther R. A Diary of the Olympia School District, 1852-1976. Olympia, WA, 1979 Early names for the settlement included \\"Smithfield\\" and \\"Smithter\\" in honor of Levi Smith. In 1853 the town settled on the name Olympia, at the suggestion of local resident Isaac N. Ebey, due to its view of the Olympic Mountains to the northwest. At the request of the Hudson's Bay Company, French Catholic missionaries established Mission St. Joseph of Newmarket and school in the 1848 at Priest Point near the future townsite for the conversion of natives to Catholicism. Olympia, with the Capitol Lake, Percival Landing, and Olympic Mountains in the distance. 1850–1890 A view from Percival Landing looking towards the Washington State Capitol. In 1851, the U.S. Congress established the Customs District of Puget Sound and Olympia became the official customs port of entry requiring all ships to call at Olympia first. In 1854, the customs house moved to Port Townsend at the entrance to Puget Sound to better monitor shipping activity. In 1852, Olympia became the county seat of the newly organized Thurston County which at the time was still part of Oregon Territory. In about 1853, Ezra Meeker says that Olympia contained about 100 inhabitants; it had 3 stores, a hotel, a livery stable, a saloon, and a weekly newspaper called The Columbian, which was in its 30th publish.Meeker, Ezra, and Lowman & Hanford Stationery & Printing Co.

By the early 1850s American settlers began agitating to separate the area north of the Columbia River from Oregon Territory. The agitation resulted in Congress creating Washington Territory. Isaac I. Stevens served as its first governor. Upon his arrival in 1853, Stevens designated Olympia capital of the new territory. The first territorial legislature convened early in 1854 at the Parker and Colter store on Main Street (now Capital Way) between State Street and Olympia Ave. Olympia's Daniel Bigelow represented Thurston County in the first three legislatures. His family home still stands, now known as Bigelow House Museum, Olympia's oldest surviving home. The city grew steadily until 1873, when the Northern Pacific Railroad building a line toward Puget Sound unexpectedly bypassed Olympia, choosing Tacoma as its west coast terminus. Alarmed by the loss of the railroad, Olympia residents set to work building their own rail connection to the main line at Tenino. Citizens formed a private corporation to raise money and build a connection. One of the early contributors was black businesswoman, Rebecca G. Howard, whose contribution of 80 acres of land was used by the committee to encourage like contributions. The corporation used both volunteer labor and contract Chinese workers to complete a narrow gauge line by 1878. The little railroad served as Olympia's only railroad connection until the Northern Pacific built a spur to Olympia in 1891. After Washington achieved statehood in 1889, Olympia continued as the state's capital city. Construction of the current Washington State Capitol began in 1912, with the prominent Legislative Building, one of the largest in the nation, completed in 1928. The building's dome is the fourth largest free-standing masonry dome in the world. Aside from its role as the seat of state government, Olympia was a fairly typical Pacific Northwest town. Early on, extraction industries such as logging and oystering were the basis of much of the economy. By the twentieth century, sawmilling, fruit canning, and other industrial concerns comprised its economic base. Olympia also served as a shipping port for materials produced from the surrounding countryside, including sandstone, coal, and agricultural products. 1890–1950 The Olympia Brewery sitting on Capitol Lake in Tumwater. Olympia is often associated with the Olympia Brewing Company, which from 1896–2003 brewed Olympia Beer, even though the brewery was actually located in Tumwater. The Olympia Brewing Company began producing beer in 1896 at a site along the Deschutes River and continued until Prohibition. After Prohibition ended, a new brewery was erected just upstream from the original site. This brewery was eventually purchased by SABMiller and closed on July 1, 2003. Scandinavian immigrants founded two cooperative plywood mills after World War I. During World War I and World War II, there were also increased influxes of workers attracted by wartime industries including shipbuilding. Periodic earthquakes affect the Olympia area. The 1949 earthquake damaged many historic downtown buildings beyond repair, and they were demolished. Others were retrofit with new facades to replace the damaged Nineteenth century wood and glass storefronts. Subsequently, much of Olympia's downtown reflects mid-twentieth-century architectural trends. Olympia also suffered significant damage from the 1965 Puget Sound and 2001 Nisqually earthquakes. It was the closest major city to the epicenter of the 2001 event. 1960–present Since the 1960s Olympia has lost much of its earlier waterfront industry, including lumber and plywood mills, shipbuilding, power pole manufacture and other concerns. While the shipping port and log staging area remains, Olympia's waterfront area has gentrified since the 1980s. In 1967, the state legislature approved the creation of The Evergreen State College near Olympia, mostly due to the efforts of progressive Republican Governor Daniel J. Evans. Evans later served as president of the college, leaving Evergreen in 1983 when he was appointed to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by Senator Henry M. \\"Scoop\\" Jackson's death. Because of the college's presence, Olympia has become a hub for artists and musicians (many of whom have been influential in punk, post-punk, anti-folk, lo-fi and other music trends (see Olympia music scene)). In 2003 Outside Magazine named Olympia one of the best college towns in the nation for its vibrant downtown and access to outdoor activities. Olympia is a regional center for social justice and environmental activism. Olympia was the hometown of activist Rachel Corrie.

The building was located on the then Dumskaya Ploschad (now Maidan Nezalezhnosti) of the Khreschatyk street and stood in the centre of it. On 22 July 1874 the Kyiv mayor (and titular Prince of San-Donato) Pavel Demidov organized festivities to commemorate installation of the new Kyiv City Duma building on project of the Russian architect Aleksandr ShileCity Duma. Kyiv City Encyclopedia. that since 1834 was located in the former building of the liquidated Kyiv Magistrate (Nazar Sukhota Building, today the Podilskyi District Building of Children Artistry). For the project were allocated 180,000 rubles. The building was finished in 1878 and on 22 January 1878 the building housed its first session of the city duma. In this manner the city administrative center was moved out of the Kyiv Podil for the first time since 1490s closer to Pechersk. The house was built with brick and originally had only two floor levels. A statue of archangel Michael, the patron of Kyiv, stood on the spire atop the building created by the Kyivan sculptor Yeva Kulikovska (a wife of Kyivan architect Valerian Kulykovskyi). After the building was built the city square at its location was named after it. In 1900 another Russian architect Aleksandr Krivosheyev added another floor level and it became a three story building. After the Russian Revolution when the Soviets took power, the archangel was replaced with a five pointed star. Also in 1919, instead of the city Duma, the building was occupied by the regional executive committee and the regional committee of Communist Party. During World War II, the building caught fire and was partially damaged by the 1941 Khreschatyk explosions that was staged by the withdrawing Soviet NKVD troops. The withdrawing Soviet troops also destroyed the city infrastructure and the building was completely burnt down along with many other buildings of Khreschatyk. It was never rebuilt after the war and its remnants were removed. Image:Kiev Duma building postcard.jpgAn early 20th century postcard with a picture of the Duma building and surroundings.

She worked mostly in musical theatre, however she has had occasional television roles. Hayakawa was also a voice actress, who worked primarily on the Spanish American dub of films and series from the United States. Early life Hayakawa was born in Fukuoka to Alfonso Javier Hayakawa, who is of Japanese descent and a native of Torreón, Coahuila, and Lourdes Elsa Salas, from the city of Chihuahua, making her of Japanese and Mexican descent. Her parents resided in Fukuoka while her father studied Industrial Engineering there. They returned to Mexico when Hiromi was only two years old, and at the time, her mother was pregnant with her second child, Kaori.

Two weeks after her expulsion, Hayakawa was given the opportunity to return to La Academia and become a finalist. Hayakawa and two other ex-students (Ricardo Hernández Quiñones and Dulce Lopez Rodriguez) were given a song which they had to perform in the next concert. The public would then vote on who they wanted to return to the finale instead of voting on who was going to be expelled. In the end Dulce Lopez Rodriguez won and went to the finale where she won 2nd place. One of the judges, Lolita Cortez, was very disappointed in the results.

It flows in a south-easterly direction and is the main feeder for the Catcleugh Reservoir which was impounded in 1901 and completed in 1905. It flows south east through Redesdale alongside the A68 road before meeting with the Otter Burn in Otterburn and heading south, before turning west at East and West Woodburn. It then heads south through Redesmouth before emptying into the River North Tyne. The name of the river derives from the Old English Rēade, meaning the red one. The river lends its name to Redesmouth, the point where the mouth is. Catchment and hydrometry The river measures from source to Redesmouth and drains an area of . In the upper reaches, the catchment is mostly upland and is partly in the Kielder Forest Park. In the lower reaches, the landscape changes slightly to grassland and upland heath with underlying boulder clay, alluvium and peat. Wildlife The Rede is known for its salmon, trout and otter, which are commonly seen within its waters. The river is notable for being one of the few places in England to have a freshwater pearl mussel population, which in 2006, was estimated at 50,000 mussels across the Rede and the North Tyne. Several projects have been undertaken to help the mussel population including limiting sediment flow in the river and the introduction of freshwater trout into the river. Previously, water that was piped from Catcleugh Reservoir to Whittle Dene Reservoir (at Harlow Hill), was cleaned annual of its harmless sediment, but the waste water was pumped into the Rede. A remedial programme costing £500,000 was implemented in 2019 to stop this from happening. The use of trout, of which 11,000 were released in 2011, is to help with the pearl mussel's life cycle. The fish were bred at the Kielder hatchery and had microscopic pearl mussel larvae attached to their gills. The programme is hopeful for repopulating parts of the river with new mussels.

She was born into a noted political family and entered politics as part of the regionalist Democratic Front of Francophones (, FDF) in 1972. She held the presidency of the FDF from 1977 to 1982 and later advocated conciliation between Francophone centrist political parties. This brought the FDF into an electoral coalition ahead of the 1999 election and paved the way for its absorption into the Reformist Movement (, MR) in 2002. Spaak held various political offices in Belgium and the European Communities until retiring from politics in 2009. Early life Spaak was born in the Brussels suburb of Etterbeek in Belgium on 27 June 1928 into a noted political dynasty. Her father was Paul-Henri Spaak, a Socialist politician and statesman who served several terms as prime minister and who played a notable role in the early years of the European Economic Community (EEC) as well as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). She was also the granddaughter of Marie Janson, the first female member of the Belgian Senate, and the grand-niece of Paul-Émile Janson, a liberal politician who would also serve as prime minister. Paul Janson, an influential liberal politician, was her great-grandfather. Spaak studied at the Free University of Brussels and graduated with a doctorate in philosophy and letters. She was the long-time partner of Étienne Davignon, who had been her father's .  Political career  Spaak entered politics after her father's death in 1972 within the regionalist Democratic Front of Francophones (, FDF) which purported to represent the interests of French-speakers in Brussels amid the political struggles between linguistic groups. She was elected to the Chamber of Representatives in the 1974 elections and became president of the FDF in 1977, becoming the first woman in Belgian history to lead a political party. She retained the FDF leadership until 1982 and presided over the much of the party's greatest electoral success in the 1970s, when regionalist sentiment in Brussels was at its height. She presided over the Council of the French Community from 1988 to 1992. An advocate of European integration, she was voted into the European Parliament in its first direct elections from 1979 to 1984 and again from 1994 to 1999. She was granted the honorary title of Minister of State in 1983. As the FDF's electoral fortunes declined in the 1980s, Spaak played a leading role alongside Jean Gol in arguing for conciliation between the FDF and the Liberal Reformist Party (, PRL). This led to an electoral alliance in 1995 between the FDF and the PRL, which was later joined by the Citizens' Movement for Change (, MCC). The FDF- PRL-MCC stood a joint list in the 1999 election, which paved the way for the formation of the Reformist Movement (, MR) in 2002. Spaak was a candidate for the MR in the 2007 elections at the bottom of the list and was not elected. However, she was elected to the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region in 2009 but resigned after less than a year. The coalition collapsed in 2011 amid a dispute on the linguistic status of the region dubbed Brussels-Halle- Vilvoorde, and the FDF seceded, rebranding as DéFI in 2016.  Death  Spaak died at her home in Brussels, Belgium, on 28 August 2020, aged 92. Sophie Wilmès, the incumbent prime minister and MR member, described Spaak on Twitter as a \\"grande dame\\". L'Echo said in its obituary that Spaak had \\"epitomised a certain idea of feminism, of francophone struggle, and European engagement\\" during her political career but noted that she had never held a ministerial portfolio.

TBNF goes beyond BNF and extended BNF (EBNF) grammar notation because it not only defines the syntax of a language, but also defines the structure of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to be created in memory and the output intermediate code to be generated. Thus TBNF defines the complete translation process from input source code to intermediate code. Specification of the output intermediate code is optional, in which case you will still get automatic AST creation and have the ability to define its structure in the grammar.

It is one of four major fashion weeks in the world, collectively known as the \\"Big 4\\", along with those in Paris, London, and Milan. The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) created the modern notion of a centralized “New York Fashion Week” in 1993, although cities like London were already using their city’s name in conjunction with the words fashion week in the 1980s. NYFW is based on a much older series of events called \\"Press Week\\", founded in 1943. It has consisted of numerous branded events, such as Olympus Fashion Week New York and MADE Fashion Week, and many independent fashion productions around town. Producers of New York Fashion Week include IMG, The SOCIETY Fashion Week, FTL Moda in conjunction with Fashion Week Online, Style 360, Art Hearts Fashion, Style Fashion Week, and ASC Fashion week among others. A centralized calendar of citywide events (including those affiliated with WME/IMG) is kept by the CFDA, and was acquired from calendar founder Ruth Finley. The economic impact of New York Fashion Week is estimated at $887 million. Origin  The first New York Fashion Week was created in 1943 by Eleanor Lambert, press director of the American fashion industry’s first promotional organization, the New York Dress Institute. The event, the world's first organized fashion week, was called \\"Press Week\\", and was created to attract attention away from French fashion during World War II, when fashion industry insiders were unable to travel to Paris to see French fashion shows. It was also meant to showcase American designers for fashion journalists, who had neglected U.S. fashion innovations. Press Week was a success, and fashion magazines like Vogue, which were normally filled with French designs, increasingly featured American fashion. By the mid-1950s, the event was known as \\"Press Week of New York\\". Spring 1951 (held February 1951) was the 16th Annual Press Week of New York.  Consolidation as \\"7th on Sixth\\" In 1993, the CFDA, led by president Stan Herman and executive director Fern Mallis, consolidated the citywide events known as \\"New York Fashion Week\\" by staging them in a cluster of white tents in Bryant Park. The event was branded with the trademark \\"7th on Sixth.\\" 21st century In 2001, \\"7th on Sixth\\" was sold to IMG. The exhibition was cancelled in September 2001 due to September 11 attacks. In 2004, the camera company Olympus became a sponsor of IMG's events, which were then renamed \\"Olympus Fashion Week.\\" In 2007, Mercedes-Benz became title sponsor of the IMG-produced events, adding New York to its roster of international \\"Mercedes-Benz fashion weeks,\\" and dubbing it \\"MB Fashion Week New York.\\" In 2010, IMG/Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week New York left the Bryant Park tents, relocating to the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. In September 2011, New York designers began live-streaming runway shows, following London, who began in February 2010. Streams were originally offered on YouTube, and later on other sites. In 2013, IMG and its New York Fashion Week events were sold to William Morris Endeavor (WME) and Silver Lake Partners for $2.3 billion. In 2014, the CFDA acquired FashionCalendar.com from Ruth Finley, who had managed it (originally in paper, then digital format) for more than 60 years.http://fashionista.com/2014/07/cfda-acquires-fashion- calendar In January 2015, Mercedes-Benz announced its departure as title sponsor from WME/IMG's events. Producer Kanye West announced he would gladly take over sponsorship of the event. In March 2015, WME/IMG announced that it had acquired MADE Fashion Week, which takes place during WME/IMG's events. In 2015, IMG's events were moved from Lincoln Center to Spring Studios. Current location Following the loss of Bryant Park and later Lincoln Center as hosting site for New York Fashion Week, the event is no longer held in one central location. Locations have included a waterfront carnival, converted railway terminals and a former post office.https://www.amny.com/lifestyle/fashion-week/new-york-fashion-week-when- where-what-to-wear-1.10833995 Other notable events Outside entrance, Spring 2009 New York Fashion Week  2014  In February 2014, Dr. Danielle Sheypuk became the first wheelchair-using model to appear in a show for New York Fashion Week; she modeled for designer Carrie Hammer. In September 2014, Karen Crespo became the first quadruple-amputee to walk at New York Fashion Week, also for Carrie Hammer. On December 12, 2014, a New York state court approved a settlement in a lawsuit by community activists over whether allowing the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week tents in Damrosch Park was a violation of the public trust doctrine. In accordance with the settlement, the City of New York, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts agreed not to renew their contract with IMG. As a result, the February 2015 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week was the last one staged in Damrosch Park. In 2014, New York State passed legislation designating models under the age of 18 as child performers, restricting the hours they can perform and requiring additional documentation.  2015  The fall/winter 2015 shows took place from February 12–19. In that week, actress Jamie Brewer became the first woman with Down syndrome to walk the red carpet at New York Fashion Week, which she did for designer Carrie Hammer. The spring/summer 2016 shows took place from September 10–17, 2015 at two new locations, Skylight at Moynihan Station in Midtown and Skylight Clarkson Square in SoHo. The economic impact of these shows was estimated to be $900 million and attendance was approximately 125,000 people. In December 2015, the CFDA announced that it had hired the Boston Consulting Group to study revising the format of New York Fashion Week to adapt to changes brought about by social media. One option being explored is to bifurcate the event, with private showroom appointments of next season's designs for buyers and public fashion shows displaying in- season merchandise for consumers.http://fashionista.com/2016/03/cfda-bcg- fashion-week-survey The first New York Fashion Week dedicated menswear shows, called \\"New York Fashion Week: Men's,\\" were produced by the CFDA in 2015.  2016  Fall/winter 2016 events took place February 11–18, 2016 at a variety of locations around New York City, including Skylight Moynihan, Skylight Clarkson, Chelsea Piers, MADE Studios, and showrooms around town. The season ended with a number of designers either experimenting with, or planning to adopt, a \\"see now, buy now model,\\" with items available from the runway immediately after (or even during) the show, rather than six months later. The charge was led by brands such as Burberry, although experiments in the format can be traced back to earlier shows by designers such as Diane von Furstenberg. Spring/summer 2017 events will be held September 8–15, 2016. (Fashion weeks are traditionally named for the season the clothes will appear at retail, six months after the events, although the trend may be changing due to fundamental shifts in the retail cycle.) The advent of \\"see now, buy now\\" shopping is expected to further transform fashion week, as collections become \\"in season\\" and select items are offered from the runway in real time.  2018  Fall/winter took place February 5–8, 2018, and spring/summer 2019 took place September 6–14, 2018. In February, major venues were Spring Studios, among others.  2019  Fall/winter 2019 took place on February 6–13, 2019. This NYFW was notable for several reasons. Nine of the ten most booked models for NYFW were models of color. In this season's NYFW, 45.8% of the models booked were people of color, a 1 percentage point increase from the previous season's show. The model with the most bookings was Mayowa Nicholas (Nigeria) with 13 shows, including Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren, and Anna Sui. This season was historic because for the first time, a transgender designer showed at NYFW. Pierre Davis, a transgender woman of color and founder of NO SESSO, debuted an agender collection. The label, which is run by Davis and her partner Arin Hayes, creates \\"a world of fashion and art inclusive of LGBTQ and ethnic identities.\\" 2020 The New York Fashion Week fall/winter 2020 took place on February 6- 13, 2020. Vogue listed the top 10 collections of New York Fashion Week Fall 2020 as follows: Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Rodarte, Gabriela Hearst, Proenza Schouler, Tory Burch, Tom Ford, Marina Moscone, Collina Strada and Christopher John Rogers. This edition was graced by Miss Earth 2019 Nellys Pimentel, who walked at the Sergio Hudson’s show, is the first-ever Puerto Rican and Caribbean woman to win Miss Earth, one of the Big Four international beauty pageants that promotes environmental awareness and conservation. thumb Attendance Admission to shows at New York Fashion Week is typically in the form of accreditation, with specific events by invitation only. No \\"official\\" New York Fashion Week In spite of CFDA's claim to run the \\"official\\" New York Fashion Week calendar,https://cfda.com/fashion- calendar/official-schedules and as further purported by publications such as Women's Wear Daily,http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/the-tentative- official-nyfw-calendar-is-here-10953303/ it has been pointed out in publications such as The Fashion Law that CFDA has \\"little, in any, legal rights in the NYFW name\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20160405222304/http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the- cfda-has-little-if-any-rights-in-the-nyfw-name Therefore, trademark rights remain unclear, at best. Trademark litigation In 2013 Fashion Week Inc., founded by business executive Trisha Paravas, registered the trademarks “New York Fashion Week,” “NYFW”, and “NYFW The Runway Shows” to use in conjunction with the production of its consumer-based fashion shows after realizing the current slate of New York Fashion Shows were invitation-only and designed for industry professionals and media. Trisha Paravas launched bi-yearly shows in December 2013 and initially called them \\"New York Fashion Shows.\\" After her first few shows drew increasing interest, she decided to rebrand it. At the time, Paravas claimed there was no trademark filed for \\"New York Fashion Week,\\" and filed for “New York Fashion Week” trademark, along with the abbreviation \\"NYFW.\\" The Council of Fashion Designers of America, Inc. (CFDA) lacked registrations for the “New York Fashion Week” trademarks, and tried to cancel Fashion Week Inc's registrations. Nonetheless, the CFDA was unsuccessful in its effort to have Fashion Week, Inc.’s “New York Fashion Week” trademark cancelled. On June 28, 2016 Fashion Week Inc. and its CEO Trisha Paravas filed a lawsuit for $10 million against CFDA and WME-IMG for trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, false designation of origin, dilution, and unfair competition. On August 12, 2016, the court denied Paravas and Fashion Week Inc.'s motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Koeltl held that although Fashion Week, Inc. does have rights in the New York Fashion Week trademark, those rights are “limited” to “online entertainment ticket agency sales.” On the other hand, the court held that the CFDA and WME IMG enjoy rights in the mark for the “broad ambit of organizing and producing fashion shows.” See also *Fashion week *List of fashion events ReferencesExternal links * Category:Fashion events in the United States Category:Annual events in New York City Category:Culture of New York City Category:Semiannual events Category:Recurring events established in 1943 Category:1943 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"New York Fashion Week"},{"id":"10095949","text":"The Former Bank of England () is a historic building at 13/14 Broad Street in Bristol, England.

Its earliest parts date back to around 1170. It was the gatehouse for St Augustine's Abbey, which was the precursor of Bristol Cathedral. The gatehouse stands to the cathedral's west, and to its own west it is abutted by the Bristol Central Library building. The library's architectural design incorporated many of the gatehouse's features. The sculptural decorations on the archways of the gatehouse contain early examples of the use of pointed arches in England. The gatehouse has been designated by Historic England as a grade I listed building. History St Augustine's Abbey was founded in 1140. The earliest parts of the gatehouse were built by around 1170, as the main entrance of the monastic precinct, giving access to its courtyard. The gatehouse was one of a number of the abbey's monastic buildings which survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, after which in 1542 the abbey became Bristol Cathedral. A deanery was later built adjoining the west side of the gatehouse. The deanery was demolished and its place abutting the gatehouse was taken by the new Bristol Central Library building in 1906. Architecture The building consists of two late Norman archways, a carriage gateway and a smaller postern gate for pedestrians, surmounted by a late Perpendicular gatehouse, with an adjoining tower. The unweathered appearance of the archways led to a public debate between 19th century commentators as to whether the archways had been rebuilt since the 12th century, but the prevailing view, as argued in the 19th century by George Edmund Street, is that they are probably the original ones. Both the north and south arches of the carriage gateway are densely decorated with carved mouldings. Inside is a ribbed vault and walls with carved interlaced arcading. The arcading contains pointed arches, which arise from the intersections of interlaced round arches, just as in the cathedral's chapter house. The similarities in the arcading, and in the two buildings' decorative patterns using a variety of motifs like chevron and nailhead, support the dating of the archways to about the same time as the chapter house, in the 12th century. The southern side of the carriage gateway is the most elaborate, with the archway having four courses of moulding. The postern gate has carved mouldings around the northern arch but is unvaulted and otherwise plain. The gatehouse and tower were additions by abbot John Newland around 1500. The gatehouse is embellished with two-storey oriels with mullion and transom windows, two-storey statuary niches and panelled parapets. These structures were restored by John Loughborough Pearson in 1888, who succeeded in retaining many of the features of their original design. He restored the oriels, which at some point had been replaced by sash windows. The single-storey eastern extension is also 19th century. Influence Charles Holden's design in 1906 for the adjoining Central Bristol Library building echoed many features of the gatehouse. The library has tall oriels with mullions and transoms, a round entrance arch and other decorations in the Tudor revival style. The shape of the gatehouse itself is imitated by the two tower-like projections at either end of the library's front. alt=Oriel windows with statues Charles Pibworth, the Bristolian sculptor who created the relief figures on the north front of the library, also carved the statues of four abbots on the south side of the gatehouse, placed there in 1914.

The National Routeing Guide is a document, the definitive resource on the validity (and invalidity) of rail tickets for the purpose of rail travel in England, Wales, and Scotland (that is, the United Kingdom except Northern Ireland). As stated by the Rail Regulator, \\"[it] sets out passengers' rights to use the network flexibly\\". It is a book produced by the Rail Delivery Group, which should always be carried by any rail ticket inspector. It is also always on hand to staff at manned stations. It is one of a number of technical railway manuals which exist as part of the operating of the rail network of Great Britain, many of which are now in the public domain. Customers generally encounter the document in specific circumstances, when they wish to prove (or check) the validity of their ticket on a route which might at first not appear obvious. Since most rail travellers make 'simple' journeys, many will never encounter it. However, when making more complex journeys, it is important to stay \\"on route\\". The guide defines what this means. Individual tickets may restrict holders to a subset of the acceptable routes, usually by requiring them to travel through a particular station. Format *The published guide is available online in PDF format, in 6 distinct sections (termed A-F), and includes an introduction and worked examples. This is identical to the version carried by rail workers, since it is derived from the Rail Delivery Group website. *A public paper copy of the guide is made available in the Office of Rail & Road library, which is open to the public by appointment. The Office of Rail & Road website also contains copies of the original 1996 Routeing Guide and the amended 1997 Routeing Guide. *In theory, paper copies are also available for public purchase, which in 2002 cost £12.50, the same price as one volume of the multi-part \\"National Fares Manual\\", which provides details of all fares on the network in 7 volumes. Enthusiasts using the routeing guide to identify good value travel often use the two together. However, paper copies are currently difficult to obtain and it is unknown if publication has ceased, although since the document is covered under the Freedom of Information Act a paper copy may be requested from the Department for Transport. Issues of value to the traveller \\"Ticketing arrangements on the UK's railways are notoriously arcane, but you can use the rules to get cheaper fares.\\" The routeing guide makes possible some of the recently publicised ticketing anomalies in the UK rail network such as saving money by purchasing tickets for long journeys as several discrete journeys instead, for example. As such it is a powerful tool in the arsenal of the knowing consumer, given the current complexity of ticket choice on the UK rail network. It is also important for travellers who contemplate a different route when faced with disruption; under these circumstances staff may stamp or sign a ticket as valid via a different route. When it was introduced, its primary aim was to \\"provide passengers with certainty about what travel their ticket buys them \\", after many years of ambiguity over 'reasonable' journeys, therefore passengers are now quite within their rights to use it as a point of reference, since it has been written and approved by the transport companies.  The On-Route principle  The primary concern of those travelling is staying on a route acceptable for the ticket they have purchased. The customer is always on-route if they can answer yes to at least one of the below, according to section A of the guide: * Is the train an advertised direct train from origin to destination? * Is the customer on the shortest (by distance) route between origin and destination? (according to the mile distances listed in the National Rail Timetable, in theory, though not always in practice.) The full routeing guide is consulted only upon answering 'No' to both questions. This can occur when the customer wishes or needs to change trains several times, either with a view to travelling on a particular line (for example to connect with a faster train), or because of a desire to break a journey at a given station not directly on the 'expected' route. = Doubling back = Passing through the same station twice is almost always forbidden, except where a rule or 'easement' allows it. = Easements = These easements are exceptions to the acceptable routes which are otherwise explicitly defined, and are listed in Section E of the Guide for easy reference. They are simple to understand one-line rules, and exist to ensure that in most circumstances the simplest journey is acceptable. For example, the \\"no doubling back\\" rule normally requires travellers changing from one line to another to change at the junction station. However, such stations are often small and poorly served, so local easements often exist to allow travel to the nearest major station. In many cases this enables the traveller to remain on 'fast' services. \\"Easement 700221: Customers travelling from, to or via Truro to St Ives ... may double back between St Erth and Penzance. This easement applies in both directions.\\" Others are matters of convenience: \\"Easement 020003: Passengers for Aviemore and Carrbridge are permitted to alight from the sleeper at Inverness and double back to their destination in the morning.\\" Some easements are negative, forbidding a route that might otherwise be acceptable. The relevant section of the Guide which is currently available at the Rail Delivery Group website details more than five hundred different easements. Disabled access Train Operating Companies may make special arrangements for disabled passengers, who have further exemptions on an individual case basis. This allows for different routes in certain situations, such as where normal practice is to walk between two nearby stations on different lines to catch a connecting train, which wheelchair users might find difficult. There are however no clear stated rules for defining what is \\"reasonable\\" for disabled people--this is presumably a matter of discretion. Some journeys must involve walks of up to 10 minutes in some cases between stations to make a connection (e.g. Farnborough (Main) to Farnborough North, Ash Vale to North Camp) Permitted Routes Three types of routes are acceptable: direct trains, shortest route, or mapped routes. The first two are simple and outlined above. Almost the whole of the routeing guide is taken up with specifying the third for the entire country. Principle *The UK rail network has stations which are deemed routeing points. These are principal stations, or junctions, shown in green on the adjacent map. Groups of nearby stations are sometimes treated as a single routeing point (e.g. \\"Portsmouth Stations\\"). *All other stations are associated with one or more routeing points. When a station has more than one routeing point available, fares from each routeing point to the other station are compared, and only those where the fare is equal to or cheaper than the overall journey are deemed appropriate. Journeys The rules can be summarised thus: *Where both stations have a common routeing point, only the shortest route between them is valid. *Otherwise, for every pair of routeing points the guide lists at least one map (or series of maps) that may be used to get from one point to the other. These maps in turn define which lines are valid between routeing points. Any route on these maps is valid so long as it does not involve doubling back (passing through the same station twice), unless there is a specific easement allowing doubling back, or the doubling back is done within a station group for the purposes of interchange. *Some ticket types have specific route restrictions, e.g. 'not London', or prescriptions e.g. 'Reading'. The guide allows many journeys which one might not expect. Travelling from Cardiff to Cambridge via Swansea, Shrewsbury, and Birmingham is acceptable, for instance, rather than simply via London. Generally there are a large number of permitted routes which are rarely used because they are inconvenient, but which are nevertheless legitimate. Some travellers have reported being charged extra for 'special' routes, however.

Informal education encompasses student interests within a curriculum in a regular classroom, but is not limited to that setting. It works through conversation, and the exploration and enlargement of experience. Sometimes there is a clear objective link to some broader plan, but not always. The goal is to provide learners with the tools he or she needs to eventually reach more complex material. It can refer to various forms of alternative education, such as unschooling or homeschooling, autodidacticism (self-teaching), and youth work. Informal education consists of an accidental and purposeful ways of collaborating on new information. It can be discussion based and focuses on bridging the gaps between traditional classroom settings and life outside of the classroom.  Role  People interpret information differently, and therefore a structured curriculum may not allow all learners to understand the information. Informal education is less controlled than the average classroom setting, which is why informal education can be so powerful. Informal education can help individuals learn to react to and control different situations and settings. In addition, it combines social entities that are important for learning. Informal education may be viewed as the learning that comes as a part of being involved in youth and community organizations. This type of education is a spontaneous process, which helps people to learn information in a new way. It helps to cultivate communities, associations and relationships that make for a positive learning environment.  Characteristics  Some characteristics of informal education are: # Informal education looks to create or deepen situations where people can learn, explore and enlarge experiences, and make changes. # Provides an environment where everyone can learn together and can scaffold off of one another. # Understanding that the activity can be based on any form of learning, the teaching does not have to be deliberate, more so implied. We give students the tools to do complex materials over time, rather than teaching the complex material and then giving the tools. # Focuses on the social aspects of learning, and how important collaborative learning is. # The tools students are given are tangible for the processes in which they will be applied. #Bridges the gap between school and life. # Allows students a choice in learning, and how to approach the material. # Make learning accessible in every day life and in the future. # Informal education is driven by conversation and interacting with others.  Benefits  # Responsiveness when interacting with the environment. # Possibility to act freely in unknown situations. # Possibility for an individual to learn without any obligations or restrictions. # Allows for free choice and changes in interests. # Ability to create ones own # bridges gap between theory and practical  Values  # Work for the well being of all. # Respect the unique value and dignity of each human being. # Dialogue. # Equality and justice. # Democracy and the active involvement of people in the issues that affect their life. (Jeff and Smith 2005:95-6) 6 Informal education focuses on values. There is no curriculum or guiding plan for a lot of work.  In indigenous African communities  Informal education has been the practice of indigenous communities in Africa as long as people have lived there. The tradition of African education has long been closely intertwined with the daily life of the African people with the idea that children \\"learnt what they lived\\". The philosophy of traditional African education suggests that one’s education cannot be separated from the everyday life and the “curriculum” is thus considered “a way of life” with the ultimate goal being to create a \\"complete individual, [and] a lifelong learner\\". The knowledge and practices that are important to the community are generally passed down through the sharing of memories and participation in cultural activities. Their education system serves as “the information base for the community, which facilitates communication and decision-making”. Similar to other indigenous communities such as the Chillihuani in Peru, African education is created with goals in mind but is not limited to typical classroom settings; students continually participate in various learning activities as they grow in the community. The culture within traditional African communities contain methods of learning. Through song and dance children learn more about their language as well as how to read and write. Oral traditions are used to teach children about history and morals as well as other forms of culture and practical skills for survival. In northern Tanzania and southern Kenya, the children of the Maasai pastoralists learn skills such as \\"where to find water and green shrubs that can be fed to young calves\\" in case of drought. Children are encouraged to show respect to their elders and through this, children learn how to show respect through their actions and words. A child can even learn the circumstances of their birth through their names. Onipede, a Yoruba name in Nigeria, suggests that the child was born soon after the death of a family member. Through their traditional science, children learn how to contribute to health and food production. everything that is a part of their life is used as a means to learn about themselves, their communities, and their culture.  Advantages  If a person masters a skill by becoming deeply engaged in solving a problem, then giving students real world issues or opportunities to solve problems in their own lives and communities would significantly motivate and help them to master new concepts. Teaching students new scientific concepts by using cultural tools could eliminate the time spent trying to figure out whether concepts are useful or not. This may motivate learners and help them to master what we teach from the start. If we applied English and grammar lessons to effectively communicate with others in the community, students would be more inclined to effectively master these concepts since they would be using them for individual or group purposes. Finally, formal schooling, unlike an informal school setting, discourages students from learning and problem solving on their own.

It was originally a Sicelian city, and was called Inessa or Inessum., Thuc., Strabo; , Steph. Byz. v. ; Diodorus has the corrupt form . History After the death of Hieron I and the expulsion of the colonists whom he had established at Catana (modern Catania), the latter withdrew to Inessa, a place of great natural strength, which they occupied, and transferred to it the name of Aetna, previously given by Hieron to his new colony at Catana. In consequence of this they continued to regard Hieron as their oekist or founder.Diod. xi. 76; Strabo vi. p. 268. The new name, however, appears not to have been universally adopted, and we find Thucydides at a later period still employing the old appellation of Inessa. It seems to have fallen into the power of the Syracusans, and was occupied by them with a strong garrison; and in 426 BC, during the Sicilian Expedition, we find the Athenians under Laches in vain attempting to wrest it from their hands.Thuc. iii. 103. During the great Athenian expedition, Inessa, as well as the neighbouring city of Hybla, continued steadfast in the alliance of Syracuse, on which account their lands were ravaged by the Athenians.Id. vi. 96. At a subsequent period the strength of its position as a fortress, rendered it a place of importance in the civil dissensions of Sicily, and it became the refuge of the Syracusan knights who had opposed the elevation of Dionysius the Elder. But in 403 BC, that despot made himself master of Aetna, where he soon after established a body of Campanian mercenaries, who had previously been settled at Catana. These continued faithful to Dionysius, notwithstanding the general defection of his allies, during the Carthaginian invasion in 396 BC, and retained possession of the city until 339 BC, when it was taken by Timoleon, and its Campanian occupants put to the sword.Diod. xiii. 113, xiv. 7, 8, 9, 14, 58, 61, xvi. 67, 82. We find no mention of it from this time until the days of Cicero, who repeatedly speaks of it as a municipal town of considerable importance; its territory being one of the most fertile in corn of all Sicily. Its citizens suffered severely from the exactions of Verres and his agents.Cicero In Verrem iii. 2. 3, 44, 45, iv. 51. The Aetnenses are also mentioned by Pliny among the populi stipendiarii of Sicily; and the name of the city is found both in Ptolemy and the Itineraries, but its subsequent history and the period of its destruction are unknown. Location Some doubt exists as to the site of Aetna. Strabo writesvi. p. 273. that it was near Centuripe, and was the place from whence travellers usually ascended the mountain. But in another passageid. p. 268. he expressly says that it was only 80 stadia from Catana. The Antonine Itineraryp. 93. places it at 12 M. P. from Catana, and the same distance from Centuripi; its position between these two cities is further confirmed by Thucydides.vi. 96. But notwithstanding these unusually precise data, its exact situation cannot be fixed with certainty. Sicilian antiquaries generally place it at Santa Maria di Licodia, which agrees well with the strong position of the city, but is certainly too distant from Catana. On the other hand, San Nicolo dell'Arena, a convent just above Nicolosi, which is regarded by Cluverius as the site, is too high up the mountain to have ever been on the high road from Catana to Centuripi. Mannert, however, speaks of ruins at a place called Castro, about 4 km northeast from Paternò, on a hill projecting from the foot of the mountain, which he regards as the site of Aetna, and which would certainly agree well with the requisite conditions.Cluverius Sicil. p. 123; Amic. Lex. Topogr. Sic. vol. iii. p. 50; Mannert, Ital. vol. ii. p. 293. This latter position is the consensus of most modern scholars.See, e.g, . Coinage There exist coins of Aetna in considerable numbers, but principally of copper; they bear the name of the people at full, ΑΙΤΝΑΙΩΝ.

It allows the cells to sense light direction and intensity and respond to it, prompting the organism to either swim towards the light (positive phototaxis), or away from it (negative phototaxis). A related response (\\"photoshock\\" or photophobic response) occurs when cells are briefly exposed to high light intensity, causing the cell to stop, briefly swim backwards, then change swimming direction. Eyespot-mediated light perception helps the cells in finding an environment with optimal light conditions for photosynthesis. Eyespots are the simplest and most common \\"eyes\\" found in nature, composed of photoreceptors and areas of bright orange- red pigment granules. Signals relayed from the eyespot photoreceptors result in alteration of the beating pattern of the flagella, generating a phototactic response. Microscopic structure Under the light microscope, eyespots appear as dark, orange-reddish spots or stigmata. They get their color from carotenoid pigments contained in bodies called pigment granules. The photoreceptors are found in the plasma membrane overlaying the pigmented bodies. The eyespot apparatus of Euglena comprises the paraflagellar body connecting the eyespot to the flagellum. In electron microscopy, the eyespot apparatus appears as a highly ordered lamellar structure formed by membranous rods in a helical arrangement. In Chlamydomonas, the eyespot is part of the chloroplast and takes on the appearance of a membranous sandwich structure. It is assembled from chloroplast membranes (outer, inner, and thylakoid membranes) and carotenoid-filled granules overlaid by plasma membrane. The stacks of granules act as a quarter-wave plate, reflecting incoming photons back to the overlying photoreceptors, while shielding the photoreceptors from light coming from other directions. It disassembles during cell division and reforms in the daughter cells in an asymmetric fashion in relation to the cytoskeleton. This asymmetric positioning of the eyespot in the cell is essential for proper phototaxis. Eyespot proteins The most critical eyespot proteins are the photoreceptor proteins that sense light. The photoreceptors found in unicellular organisms fall into two main groups: flavoproteins and retinylidene proteins (rhodopsins). Flavoproteins are characterized by containing flavin molecules as chromophores, whereas retinylidene proteins contain retinal. The photoreceptor protein in Euglena is likely a flavoprotein. In contrast, Chlamydomonas phototaxis is mediated by archaeal-type rhodopsins. Besides photoreceptor proteins, eyespots contain a large number of structural, metabolic and signaling proteins. The eyespot proteome of Chlamydomonas cells consists of roughly 200 different proteins. Photoreception and signal transduction The Euglena photoreceptor was identified as a blue-light-activated adenylyl cyclase. Excitation of this receptor protein results in the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a second messenger. Chemical signal transduction ultimately triggers changes in flagellar beat patterns and cell movement. The archaeal-type rhodopsins of Chlamydomonas contain an all-trans retinylidene chromatophore which undergoes photoisomerization to a 13-cis isomer. This activates a photoreceptor channel, leading to a change in membrane potential and cellular calcium ion concentration. Photoelectric signal transduction ultimately triggers changes in flagellar strokes and thus cell movement.

The operation was aimed against the Rur River, as a staging point for a subsequent thrust over the river to the Rhine into Germany. It was conducted by the First and Ninth U.S. Armies. The offensive commenced on 16 November 1944 with one of the heaviest Allied tactical bombings of the war. However, the Allied advance was unexpectedly slow, against heavy German resistance, especially in the Hürtgen Forest through which the main thrust of the offensive was carried out. By mid- December, the Allies finally reached the Rur and tried to capture its important dams, when the Germans launched their own offensive, dubbed Wacht am Rhein. The ensuing Battle of the Bulge led to the immediate cessation of Allied offensive efforts into Germany until February 1945. Background In June 1944, the Allies conducted the invasion in Northern France and opened a new front. After the Allied breakout from Normandy, the German Wehrmacht was involved in a string of disastrous battles in July and August, most notably the Falaise pocket. Following those events, the German defense in northern and western France disintegrated, leading to a hasty retreat of the German forces. The rapid Allied advance together with the ongoing march of the Red Army in the east let the Allied High command believe that the Wehrmacht was about to collapse and total victory could be achieved by Christmas 1944. The Allies, therefore, launched a high-risk plan for a direct thrust through the Netherlands into Germany, called Operation Market Garden. This overly ambitious plan failed, as the Wehrmacht was able to reorganize itself and consolidate its strength. By mid-September, the Allied advance abruptly ended, as the Allies suffered from a logistics crisis, outrunning their supply lines. This gave the Germans further time to prepare for the upcoming Allied offensives. The Germans now could man the fortifications of the Westwall (Siegfried Line), although its old bunkers were more symbolic than a real obstacle for the Allies.Zaloga (2007), pp. 9–12 First thrust into the Hürtgen Forest In the north in Belgium, the Allies were still involved in the Battle of the Scheldt, while in the south in France the Lorraine Campaign was still ongoing. In the center, the Battle of Aachen was fought from 2–21 October at the German border. The heavy German resistance upset Allied plans for a fast resumption of the rapid advance. As preparation for Operation Queen, a preliminary offensive into the Hürtgen Forest had to be carried out, to secure the flanks against a possible German counterattack out of the forest. The goal was to clear a pathway to the important road junction at Düren, to gain a respectable starting position for Queen. The 9th Infantry Division was already engaged in the forest since September, so only moderate German resistance was expected. On 2 November, three days before the anticipated start of Operation Queen, the offensive against the town of Schmidt was launched by the 28th Division against the German 275th Division. The town was captured, but the Germans reacted swiftly by reallocating forces of the 89th Infantry Division and mobile reserves from the 116th Panzer Division, which drove the Allies out of the town, transforming the battle into a bloody stalemate.Zaloga (2007), 48–61 Planning Bradley, Gerow, Eisenhower and Collins The Allied High Command planned a large offensive in the area of the Ninth U.S. Army together with the First U.S. Army and parts of the British 2nd Army against the Rur River, intending to establish bridgeheads at Linnich, Jülich and Düren. The First Army – already stationed near the Hürtgen Forest – had to carry out the main effort through the Hürtgen Forest toward the Rur River. The Ninth Army had to advance north of the forest through the Rur plains. The British XXX Corps – together with units from the U.S. XIII Corps – had to reduce the Geilenkirchen salient in the north in a different operation named Operation Clipper. The long term target after the Rur was crossed was to reach the Rhine and establish bridgeheads at Krefeld and Düsseldorf to secure further advances inside Germany after the winter. A great number of American and British strategic bombers were to conduct a series of tactical assaults in the area to cut supply lines and destroy enemy infrastructure, and also to attack the enemy defenders inside their positions. The entire operation was codenamed Queen. The 8th U.S. Air Force was to bomb the fortifications around Eschweiler and Aldenhoven, while the medium bombers of the 9th Air Force were assigned to the second line of defense around Jülich and Langerwehe. At the same time, the RAF Bomber Command was to hit the traffic centres of Jülich and Düren hard; the smaller towns of Heinsberg, Erkelenz and Hückelhoven were designated as secondary targets.MacDonald (1993), pp. 390–392, 397–406, 546–547 Rundstedt (middle) and Model (left) planning the Ardennes Offensive Initially, the starting date of the offensive was set for 5 November, later 10 November, but because of bad weather it was delayed until 16 November. The ground offensive was to begin immediately after the air raids, allowing the defenders no time to reestablish fortifications, supply routes and communications.MacDonald (1993), pp. 406–407Zaloga (2007), p. 61 German planning was entirely different. Running out of strategic options, the Wehrmacht planned an all-out counteroffensive in the West, codenamed Wacht am Rhein. The first draft of the plan was already completed in secret in October 1944 and was aimed against the Ardennes, mirroring the successful campaign in 1940 against France. The plan required for the best divisions of the Wehrmacht to be held back from the autumn fighting, to gain time to build them up for the planned offensive. For the successful execution of the plan, the holding of the Rur River line was deemed as absolutely important, to prevent the Allies from a flanking attack. The German plan for the November–December Campaign was, therefore, to hold the Rur River line with a minimum of available forces until the Ardennes Offensive could be launched.Zaloga (2007), pp. 28–30 The Germans also had a card up their sleeve. With control over the dams on the Rur, they could release the water from them and flood the Rur valley and everything else downstream of it as far as the Meuse and into the Netherlands. That would cause large scale destruction and destroy Allied bridges over the Rur, isolating all troops east of the river. The Allies did not fully recognize the strategic importance of the dams for some time, and only days before the end of the offensive they made their first specific moves towards them.MacDonald (1993), pp. 323–328 Opposing forces The Allied forces participating in the operation were the U.S. First and Ninth Armies, assigned to Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group. The First Army's units for the operation consisted of the V and VII Corps, that latter assigned for the main thrust through the Hürtgen Forest, with V Corps protecting its southern flank. For the upcoming offensive, both armies were heavily reinforced. Total strength of the First Army rose from about 250,000 in September to about 320,000 before the offensive, although only about 120,000 troops would participate in the main operation. The First Army's tank strength was about 700 tanks. In October the Allies suffered from major supply shortcomings, but by early November those had been mostly resolved. The Ninth Army was somewhat smaller, consisting mainly of the XIX Corps and some independent divisions, with the XIII Corps in reorganization. As support for the ground operations, the Allies planned their largest tactical bombing of the war, employing more than 4,500 planes.MacDonald (1993), pp. 397–404, 593–594 After the chain of disasters in the summer of 1944, the Allies expected the Wehrmacht to be unable to recover, but this was not the case. Although manpower losses were enormous, the Wehrmacht sought to compensate for this with transferring of men from the Reserve Army, the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine into frontline troops for rebuilding their forces. Regarding industrial production the situation was even better. Despite the increasing Allied bombing campaign and the loss of territories and factories, Germany reached its peak of wartime production in the autumn of 1944, after the reforms of Albert Speer and the increased use of forced labour. For the preparing of the Ardennes Offensive, the 5th Panzer Army was pulled out of the front and replaced by the 15th Army, although for deception purposes its name was changed to conceal this fact. The Allies, therefore, faced two armies: the 15th Army in the Hürtgen Forest; and the 7th Army in the north in the Rur plains. Although nominally an equal force to the Allies on paper, the Germans were heavily outnumbered. In some sectors, the ratio of attacker to defender was about 5 to 1. The reason for this was the acute manpower shortage that the Germans were experiencing. Most of the German units were seriously understrength, with some divisions consisting of only a few thousand men. However, heavy entrenchment and the availability of considerable tank and artillery support went some way to compensate for those problems. The German troops were commanded by OB West Generalfeldmarshall Gerd von Rundstedt and commander of Army Group B Generalfeldmarshall Walther Model, with the latter considered a skilled defense specialist.MacDonald (1993), pp. 392–397, 409–411Zaloga (2007), pp. 16–18 Offensive=Preliminary air raids On 16 November 1944 between 11:13 and 12:48, the Allied bombers conducted the preliminary bombings of Operation Queen. 1,204 heavy bombers of the U.S. 8th Air Force hit Eschweiler, Weisweiler and Langerwehe with 4,120 bombs, while 339 fighter bombers of the U.S. 9th Air Force attacked Hamich, Hürtgen and Gey with of bombs. At the same time, 467 Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers attacked Düren and Jülich; 180 British bombers hit Heinsberg.MacDonald (1993), pp. 411–412 The result of the bombing was mixed. The German towns being hit suffered from severe destruction. German communications after the bombing were heavily impaired, and there was a considerable effect on morale, especially of units consisting of more younger and inexperienced troops. However, the direct damage dealt to the German frontline troops was low, and casualties were few. Allied air commanders admitted that the bombing did not measure up to expectations. About 12 aircraft were shot down during the initial bombing by meager anti-aircraft fire.MacDonald (1993), pp. 413–414 First Army's advance through the Hürtgen ForestVII Corps November fighting= The offensive from November until 9 December Together with the bombing raids, heavy artillery bombardments preceded the main thrust of J. Lawton Collins' VII Corps. Opposed to his units were the shattered forces of LXXXI Corps, commanded by Friedrich Köchling. The LXXXI Corps consisted of three divisions: the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, the 246th Infantry Division and the 12th Volksgrenadier Division. Another unit, the 47th Volksgrenadier Division, was in the process of being transferred to the front. It was mostly made up of 18– and 19-year-old Luftwaffe personnel. All the German divisions were seriously understrength, but mobile artillery and tank reserves were available.MacDonald (1993), pp. 409–411 The attack of VII Corps commenced with a two-pronged attack with 1st Infantry Division on the right and the 104th Infantry Division on the left. In its initial attack 1st Division was only able to make ground slowly against the 47th VGD around Hamich. Casualties were heavy, especially after reinforced counterattacks by still-present mobile reserves from the 116th Panzer Division. After four days of fighting Hamich was taken, but 1st Division had only advanced about , with casualties already numbering more than 1,000 men.Zaloga (2007), p. 64 Meanwhile, Collins ordered the American 3rd Armored Division to divide its constituent combat commands. CCA was assigned to assist the 104th Division, while CCB would act independently to take four villages (Werth, Koettenich, Scherpenseel, and Hastenrath) in the northwestern fringes of the Hürtgen Forest, defended by the 12th VGD. This small corridor between the 1st and the 104th Division was one of the few places suitable for an armored thrust. Although CCB was able to accomplish its task in three days, the heavy mud had hindered its movement and tank casualties were heavy; CCB lost 49 out of 69 tanks.MacDonald (1993), pp. 421–424 1st Division's advance continued to be slow. The German defenders were in a favorable heightened position, from which they could overlook the approach routes of the Allied forces. The German tactic was to fight mainly in the thick woods, where American artillery and aerial support was ineffective and a state of bloody trench warfare emerged. The Americans had to take hill after hill in heavy fighting, while casualties were mounting. Numerous German counterattacks slowed the advance down even more, often taking back ground which had just been captured in a bloody fight. In an act of desperation, Collins moved in virtually all of his available artillery to blast a way for the 1st Division on 21 November. With the Allied advance already flagging in the first phase of the offensive, CCA of the 3rd Armored Division was assigned to the northern part of the 1st Division's left flank. The armored attack was able to capture the castle at Frenzerburg (near Inden). This fight lasted until 28 November. Meanwhile, GFM Rundstedt decided to inject some reinforcements into the battle, but only if two divisions were simultaneously pulled out from the front for the Ardennes Offensive preparations. Therefore, the 3rd Parachute Division was transferred to the front, while the bled out 12th and 47th VGD were withdrawn. The logistical difficulties and the inexperience of the new opponent aided 1st Division and it was finally able to push out of the forest, taking Langerwehe, Jüngersdorf and Merode by 28 November. Nevertheless, the dire situation did not change, and a violent counterattack by 3rd Parachute Division at Merode led to the destruction of two companies. At the beginning of December, 1st Division was worn out and had already suffered about 6,000 casualties.MacDonald (1993), pp. 492–488;476–477; 481Zaloga (2007), p. 65 German artillery in the Hürtgen Forest The advance of the 104th Division went somewhat better. The unit secured the left flank of VII Corps between the First and the Ninth US Army. The target of the unit was the industrial triangle at Eschweiler-Weisweiler and the Eschweiler woods at Stolberg. This part of the front was dominated by the Donnersberg, near the identically named village. The division faced the German 12th VGD as well as the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division. Heavy fighting ensued at the Donnerberg, but by 19 November the important hill was in American hands. After that, the division renewed its drive and headed for Stolberg and Eschweiler simultaneously. Stolberg was taken on the same day, but German resistance at Eschweiler was heavy, so the Americans attempted to encircle the town. This worked, and the German command decided to withdraw from the town, abandoning it to the 104th Division. The division then advanced alongside the western bank of the Inde River. Heavy fighting ensued, and the 12th VGD fought to its near destruction, until it was replaced by the incoming 3rd Parachute Division. By 26 November Weisweiler was taken after the Germans chose to retreat from the town. Inden fell on 30 November, bringing the industrial triangle into American hands. The 104th Division now held the western bank of the Inde and was ready to cross the river to push to the Rur.MacDonald (1993), pp. 506–510; 424–428 The crossing of the river at Lamersdorf commenced on 2 December. It was initially successful and in a swift advance the real objective, Lucherberg, was taken. The division was still conducting mop-up operations when the Germans mounted a counterattack against the town, assisted by heavy tanks. Intense fighting raged on for hours; on 5 December the town was finally secured, and Collins ordered a pause due to the slow advance of the other divisions of the corps.MacDonald (1993), pp. 510–515 Aside from the double thrust conducted by the 1st and 104th Division, the American command had determined that another attack route should be taken towards Düren. This task was passed to the 4th Infantry Division, which was positioned at VII Corps southern wing to take a route between Hürtgen and Schevenhütte, also capturing the villages of Kleinhau and Grosshau. Here the division would take over positions of the depleted 28th Infantry Division, which had been badly mauled during the preliminary fighting of Operation Queen at Schmidt. This position was still held by the weakened but experienced German 275th Infantry Division. The thinned out German lines could not offer as much resistance as in early November, but the difficult terrain, as well as the mines, caused heavy casualties to the Americans. After five days of fighting, the division had only advanced about , but had already suffered 1,500 casualties. At the same time, the German command again made changes to the order of battle. The 116th Panzer Division, which had helped to mount several counterattacks during the early fighting, was withdrawn on 21 November from the area to be refitted for the upcoming Ardennes Offensive. The same was for the understrength 275th Division. As compensation, the inexperienced 344th Volksgrenadier Division was released and rushed to the front, while the 353rd Volksgrenadier Division was placed behind it as a reserve force.Zaloga (2007), pp. 67–69MacDonald (1993), pp. 428–429 =V Corps joins the offensive= Army engineers repairing a muddy road in the Hürtgen Forest The initial planning did not see a deployment of General Gerow's V Corps until VII Corps had achieved a major breakthrough. V Corps then would have to make a close drive together with VII Corps towards Bonn. However, after the first days the American senior command realized that VII Corps would need extra assistance to achieve a breakthrough. Therefore, V Corps was ordered to join the fighting. The Corps was situated south of VII Corps. Gerow's first action was to relieve the 28th Division with the 8th Infantry Division, to assist the drive of the already fighting 4th Division. The division was assisted by a CCR from the 5th Armored Division. The corps took over Hürtgen and Kleinhau as objectives from the 4th Division and started its attack on 21 November.MacDonald (1993), p. 440 The advance of the 8th Division was steady but very slow. 4th Division reached Grosshau on 25 November, but could not capture it due to heavy resistance and coordination problems with the supporting armored units. At the same time, the tanks of CCR tried a direct assault on Hürtgen, which ended in complete failure against German anti-tank positions. In a renewed attack conducted by infantry only, Hürtgen was taken on 28 November. The 4th and 8th divisions simultaneously attacked Grosshau and Kleinhau on 29 November, and both towns were captured the same day. This success spurred the American efforts. The 8th Division together with the CCR continued its advance for the next days eastwards towards the Brandenberg-Bergstein ridge. Brandenberg was taken on 2 December. The same day a rare massive Luftwaffe raid occurred with about 60 planes, but did only minor damage. On 5 December Bergstein fell. Facing the Allied advance, the Germans mounted a massive counterattack into the town. During the night and over the next day heavy fighting ensued until the German forces were repulsed, and Castle Hill, an important hill beyond Bergstein overseeing the town, was taken. V Corps was now in striking distance of the Rur and reached the river a day later.MacDonald (1993), pp. 444–448; 463Zaloga (2007), pp. 69–76 In the meantime, 4th Division also had made some progress. After the capture of Grosshau, the division was aided by the armored forces of the CCR. The division now headed for Gey, which was reached on 30 November, but heavily defended. Two days later the Germans mounted a counterattack out from Gey, which caused heavy casualties. The attack was only stopped by intense artillery fire. Since the beginning of the offensive, 4th Division had already lost about 6,000 men and was now unable to conduct further offensive operations. Subsequently, Collins decided to halt its offensive operations and pulled the division out to replace it with the 83rd Infantry Division on 3 December.MacDonald (1993), pp. 473–474 At the beginning of December, First Army had fought its way through most of the Hürtgen Forest. Although V Corps had reached the Rur at the very southern wing, VII Corps was still short of its objective of reaching the Rur. Casualties for this campaign were tremendous. The fighting for the Hürtgen Forest, which lasted already since September, had cost the Americans about 32,000 men.Zaloga (2007), p. 76 Ninth Army's advance through the Rur plains Parallel to First Army's advance through the Hürtgen Forest, Ninth Army had to advance through the Rur plains. This terrain was fundamentally different from the dense forest, consisting of flat farmland with small villages. Planning for this area for both sides was different, as the Germans expected the Allied main thrust through this area, while it was actually through the Hürtgen Forest. One of the reasons for this decision was the dangerous Geilenkirchen-Salient at Ninth Army's northern flank, which would have threatened the American advance. This salient was reduced and rendered harmless in Operation Clipper, by a combined US-British attack until 22 November. The 84th Division of XIII Corps of the Ninth Army played a major role in this operation.Zaloga (2007), pp. 76–77 Ninth Army's drive was conducted mainly by XIX Corps under General Gillem and was opposed by Köchling's LXXXI Corps as well as the reserve forces of the XLVII Panzer Corps. The plan called for a swift advance to Jülich with its 3 divisions. The 2nd Armored Division had to advance in a narrow line towards Linnich and from there towards the Rur. In the center 29th Infantry Division had to take the direct path towards Jülich and in the south the 30th Infantry Division had to take Würselen and then continue to the Rur.MacDonald (1993), pp. 516–518 As in the First Army's sector, Operation Queen began with a massive aerial bombardment against German towns and positions on 16 November. After the air strike was over, the American offensive was launched. 30th Division started a frontal attack against its first objective – Würselen. After four days of slow advance, the town was taken. The German resistance from the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division was hampered due to the large area it had to cover. In the center, 29th Division also commenced with its attack. The plan called to advance in between the towns to deal with the fortified strong points after they were encircled. This plan, however, was flawed and 29th Division soon was pinned down making no further progress. With assistance from the 2nd Armored Division, on 18 November its drive was renewed against the opposing German 246th VGD, taking Setterich, Bettendorf and the surroundings of Siersdorf. The understrength 246th VGD was heavily reduced, and by 21 November the Americans were just ahead of the Rur. Captured Tiger II with improvised Allied markings Meanwhile, in the north 2nd Armored Division also had commenced its attack on Gereonsweiler and Linnich. The advance was very steady, and already on the next day the towns Puffendorf and Immendorf were taken. This alarmed the German command and Rundstedt authorized the release of the 9th Panzer Division for a heavy armored counterattack against the two towns. Attached to this unit was the 506th Heavy Panzer Battalion with about 36 King Tiger tanks. At Immendorf the Germans were able to break into the town, but were repelled in close quarter fighting at dawn. The main fighting, however, was at Puffendorf. Since 2nd Armored Division also wanted to continue its advance towards Gereonsweiler, the division was caught in the open when about 30 German tanks approached it. In the ensuing battle, the Americans were pushed back into Puffendorf with heavy losses. Fighting then continued around the towns. German losses for this day were 11 tanks, while the 2nd Armored Division lost about 57 tanks in the fighting. However, the stalemate did not last long, as the Americans were able to push slowly forward through combined heavy artillery and aerial support. On 20/21 November, heavy fighting occurred in and around Gereonsweiler, until the Germans retreated and the town was finally in American hands.Zaloga (2007), pp. 82–83Mayo (1968), p. 324 As of 22 November, all 3 divisions of XIX Corps were in striking range of the Rur. At this point, the German command decided to release another division, the 340th Volksgrenadier Division, to the front, as the threat to Jülich came apparent. The 340th Division moved in to take over positions of the badly mauled 246th VGD. Due to this reinforcement, the advance of the 29th and 30th Infantry Division stalled after they were ejected from Bourheim. The last German defense ring before Jülich was now between Bourheim, Koslar and Kirchberg (Jülich). The same happened to the 2nd Armored Division which was repelled from Merzenhausen. During the next days, fighting at the defense line was very intense, mostly leading to the exchange of heavy artillery barrages. Bourheim was taken on 23 November but remained under constant shelling from German forces. Two days later American troops entered Koslar. A subsequent German counterattack managed to break into Bourheim and Koslar, but was soon afterwards repelled. On 26 November a general offensive was started to finally push to the Rur. Koslar, Kirchberg and Merzenburg were taken on 27 November. By 28 November, XIX Corps had reached the Rur on a broad front with only two German bridgeheads on the western side of the river remaining, which were not taken until 9 December.MacDonald (1993), pp. 558–565 North of XIX Corps, Geilenkirchen had been captured during Operation Clipper, but the Allied advance had stalled at Wurm some kilometers short of the Rur, rendering the Allied advance in this sector a stalemate. Ninth Army's casualties for Operation Queen were 1,133 killed, 6,864 wounded, and 2,059 missing.MacDonald (1993), p. 577 VII Corps pushes to the Rur While Ninth Army's advance was successful, at the beginning of December VII Corps had just left the Hürtgen Forest, was still short of the Rur and had taken heavy casualties. For the upcoming conclusion of the offensive, 1st Infantry Division was replaced by 9th Infantry Division and 4th Infantry Division by the 83rd Infantry Division. After a deliberate break for reorganisation, the attack was resumed on 10 December towards the Rur and the key city of Düren. German manpower at this point was very low with the defense relying mostly on artillery support. In the north 104th and 9th Division, assisted by the 3rd Armored Division, didn't face much resistance. The 3rd Parachute Division and especially the worn out 246th VGD were not able to offer serious resistance. After four days 104th Division was at the Rur. The same was for the 9th Division. During the fighting, 3rd Parachute Division was replaced by the hastily assembled 47th Volksgrenadier Division.Zaloga (2007), pp. 86–88 In the south 83rd Division faced larger problems. It had to advance through the towns of Strass and Gey, the latter had just been the location of a heavy battle which practically had rendered 4th Division unable for further offensive operations. Nevertheless, the fresh 83rd Division assisted by the 5th Armored Division was able to take most of Strass and reach Gey the same day against the worn out 353rd VGD. However, the muddy road and mines prevented the Americans from bringing their tanks into both towns to support the infantry. As a result, after some determined German counterattacks on Schafberg, the American units in Strass were effectively cut off and had to be supplied by aircraft, while the Germans started several attacks on the town. Schafberg was retaken on 12 December and tanks reached Gey and Strass, easing the situations. Casualties nevertheless had been heavy, with about 1,000 men for the division in just 3 days.MacDonald (1993), pp. 587–591 In the north of Gey the division's advance fared better and the division took the towns Gürzenich and Birgel. On 14 December a renewed drive conducted by tanks was launched. After meeting initial heavy resistance east of Strass, the advance at other parts of the frontline forced the Germans to retreat. By 16 December VII Corps finally had reached the Rur, with only a few small bridgeheads west of the river remaining. Casualties for this campaign were tremendous, as VII Corps had about 27,000 casualties in one month.Zaloga (2007), pp. 88–89 The Rur dams During the Allied approach towards the Rur, the issue of the Rur dams took on a new urgency. The dams were a strategically important target, as they would allow the Germans to flood the Rur valley and everything else downstream of it as far as the Meuse and into the Netherlands. This would delay the Allied offensive effort into Germany, possibly causing major casualties as well as trapping Allied units east of the flooding. It took a long time until the Allied high command recognized its importance and until the first specific actions were implemented towards them. The first approach was made by the RAF which was tasked to breach them, with bombing starting in early December. In continuous attack waves, hundreds of aircraft were thrown against the dams, but the damage was only negligible. On 13 December V Corps, already at the Rur, was tasked to start an offensive to seize the dams from various directions including the Ardennes sector. The offensive took the Germans by surprise, but as the Allies ran directly into the Germans being near ready for the Ardennes Offensive, resistance soon stiffened. On 16 December the Germans launched their final all-out offensive on their western front, Wacht am Rhein, which led to an immediate end of all Allied offensive efforts in this sector.Zaloga (2007), pp. 89–90MacDonald (1993), pp. 597–602 Aftermath Operation Queen was not able to meet its sophisticated goals. At the beginning of the offensive, Allied planners envisioned for the offensive to be just a staging point for a deep penetration over the Rur into Germany to the Rhine. After one month of heavy fighting the Americans had barely made it to the Rur. No bridgehead over the river had been made, the Germans still held some portions west of the river and the important Rur dams were still in German hands, threatening any further offensive operations. Even without knowing the upcoming German offensive, Allied planners estimated the earliest date for a large thrust into Germany for mid-January.MacDonald (1993), pp. 594–595 The Wehrmacht was successfully able to delay the American advance towards the Rur. The Rur River line, whose holding was deemed necessary for the successful implementation of the Ardennes Offensive, was held. The preparation of the final Ardennes Offensive was mostly successful with Germany being able to build up enough troops in secrecy for a sufficient blow. On 16 December the Allies were taken by complete surprise and the Germans were quickly able to achieve a breakthrough. Later (14 until 26 January 1945), the Roer triangle was cleared during Operation Blackcock and only in February 1945 were the Allies finally able to cross the Rur, by then the road to the Rhine was clear. However, the Ardennes offensive also showed the lack of any long-term strategic perspective for Germany. The superiority of the Allies in numbers of men and equipment could not be overcome by Germany. The successful holding of the Rur River line would only lead to a lengthened war, causing additional destruction and loss of life.Zaloga (2007), pp. 91–92 Notes * VII Corps: 2,448 killed, 15,908 battle casualties, 8,550 non-battle casualties V Corps: 2,800 battle casualties, 1,200 non-battle casualties Ninth Army: 1,133 killed, 6,864 wounded, and 2,059 missing Casualties of the Rur dams offensive (13–16 December) and casualties in the Hürtgen Forest preceding 16 November not included See also *17th Armored Engineer Battalion *82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion *List of World War II military operations ReferencesBibliography  Category:Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine O Category:Battles of World War II involving the United States Category:Conflicts in 1944 Category:Military operations of World War II involving Germany Category:November 1944 events Category:December 1944 events Category:1944 in Germany ","title":"Operation Queen"},{"id":"10096267","text":"Novaci () is a municipality in the southern part of North Macedonia.

Christian tradition states that he was a shepherd boy who saw a vision during an eclipse in 1177 which led him to build a bridge over the Rhône River at Avignon. He was told that angels would watch over his flocks in his absence. He built the bridge single-handedly; ecclesiastical and civil authorities refused to help him. Bénézet, it is said, lifted a huge stone into place, and announced it would be the start of the foundation. This would become the Pont Saint-Bénézet. According to the legend, there were shouts of \\"Miracle! Miracle!\\" when Bénézet had laid the first stone. Eighteen miracles occurred in total: the blind had their vision restored, the deaf could hear again, cripples could walk; and hunchbacks had their backs straightened. Bénézet thus won support for his project from wealthy sponsors who, it is claimed, formed themselves into the Bridge-Building Brotherhood to fund its construction. Veneration After his death, Bénézet was interred on the bridge itself, in a small chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas, patron saint of mariners, standing on one of the bridge's surviving piers on the Avignon side. His relics were enshrined there until 1669, when a flood washed away part of the bridge. His coffin, recovered, was opened and the body of Bénézet was found to be incorrupt.

Early life and education Bewley was born Beulah Rosemary Knox on 2 September 1929 in a Protestant family in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, the daughter of Ina Knox (née Charles), who came from a wealthy family, and John Knox, who worked for the Ulster Bank. Aged 14 she became a boarder at Dublin's Alexandra College. Aged five, Bewley decided that she wanted to become a doctor, and went on to qualify as a doctor at Trinity College Dublin in 1953. Bewley worked in paediatrics and preventative medicine for fifteen years, before undertaking a Master of Science degree in social medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, where she was the only woman in the class. Career She served on the Royal Society of Medicine's section on Epidemiology and Public Health. In her career she worked at several institutions in London including the Academic Department of Community Medicine at King's College Hospital Medical School, the Department of Community Medicine, St Thomas’s Hospital Medical School, London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 1982 she served on the Faculty of Public Health Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of the United Kingdom. Her medical school, Trinity College, celebrated its tercentenary in 2011, and Bewley served on the tercentenary board from 2007–2012. She died on 20 January 2018 at the age of 88. Awards and honours Bewley was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2000 New Year Honours for services to public health, and in recognition of her leading role in promoting equal opportunities for women. She was conferred with an Honorary LLD by Trinity College Dublin in 2002. Selected works=Autobiography * (autobiography) Publications on smoking * Bewley BR, Bland JM, Harris R.

History Designers Édouard Joly and Jean Délémontez based the design on two of their earlier projects; they combined the wing of the projected D.10 with a lengthened and widened version of the D.9 fuselage. The first example flew on 4 April 1950. Of conventional tailwheel configuration, the D11 featured a fixed, spatted undercarriage, and accommodated pilot and passenger side-by- side. The wing panels outboard of the landing gear struts had a marked dihedral. Various powerplants were installed, typically Salmson 9, Continental O-170 or Continental O-200. The aircraft uses all-wood construction with a single piece box-spar.

Many of his works show the influence of Nicolae Grigorescu; an influence that was common among painters of his generation. Biography His father was a government clerk employed by the prefecture of Suceava. He lost his mother at an early age and was raised by his grandmother.Review of Pictură sau destin by Macarie @ LiterNautica. From 1907 to 1912, he attended the \\"Alexandru Donici Gymnasium\\" in his hometown, where he displayed an aptitude for drawing.Biographical notes, In Memoriam @ Apostolul. After graduating, he entered the Școala de Belle Arte in Iași, where he studied with and Gheorghe Popovici. In 1915, he received an award from the Academia Română for his portrait of the French artist Lecomte de Nöuy, who was then living in Romania. During World War I, he was mobilized but, at the last moment, was sent to the rear, where he joined several other artists who were documenting the war. Although he escaped being wounded, the harsh conditions there led to a case of pneumonia that left him in poor health. In an effort to improve his artistic perspectives, and with the support of members of the Academia, he went to Italy to attend a free painting course being taught at the Institute of Fine Arts in Rome. He was there from 1920 to 1922. Four years later, he travelled throughout Slovenia, Hungary and France. For many years, he was enamored of Lia Sadoveanu, the daughter of novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, but could never propose marriage because of his precarious financial situation. In 1928, he died of tuberculosis, aged only thirty-two. A major retrospective of his work was held in 2006 at the art museum in Bacău. In 2012, his tomb was looted and destroyed.

The best-known defender of the argument from consciousness is J. P. Moreland. Philosophical summary of the argument The argument may be stated in inductive or deductive formBoth these are following J. P Moreland \\"The Argument from Consciousness\\" in The Rationality of Theism ed Paul Copan and Paul Moser, London:Routeledge (2003) and J. P Moreland \\"Consciousness and The Existence of God\\" An alternate, closely related, version of the argument uses Platonism as its premise in a deductive argument. http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm#11 Inductive form Richard Swinburnesee Richard Swinburne The Existence of God Oxford:Clarendon (1979) Ch 9; The Evolution of the Soul 183-9 etc. put forward an inductive form of the argument in his book The Existence of God. He uses the argument from personal identity for mind-body dualism to show that we have a non-physical mental element to our minds. He suggests that the most probable way in which the non-physical and the physical are linked in causal- interaction is by design- which implies a designer. Swinburne suggests that this designer is God. He says that whilst this argument, owing to its inductive form, is inconclusive, it does provide strong evidence for a God. Deductive form # Mental states are genuine nonphysical mental entities that exist. # Specific mental and physical event types are regularly correlated. # There is an explanation for these correlations. # Personal explanation is different from natural scientific explanation. # The explanation for these correlations is either a personal or natural scientific explanation. # The explanation is not a natural scientific one. # Therefore, the explanation is a personal one. # If the explanation is personal, then it is theistic. # Therefore, the explanation is theistic.Quoted from The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology, The Argument from Consciousness, by J.P. Moreland, p. 296 Theists such as Robert AdamsSee Robert Adams \\"Flavors, Colors and God\\" reprinted in Contemporary Perspectives on Religious Epistemology OUP (1992) pp225-40 have advanced a slightly different version of Swinburne's argument which focuses on mental/physical correlations and not merely the existence of mental states. These are similar to Swinburne's argument but take a deductive form rather than an inductive one. William Lane Craig put the argument from consciousness as follows:https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence- nature-of-god/does-god-exist1/ #If God did not exist, intentional states of consciousness would not exist. #But intentional states of consciousness do exist. #Therefore, God exists. Peter Kreeft has put forward a deductive form of the argument from consciousnesshttp://www.peterkreeft.com/topics- more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm#10 based upon the intelligibility of the universe despite the limitations of our minds. He phrases it deductively as follows: #\\"We experience the universe as intelligible. This intelligibility means that the universe is graspable by intelligence.\\" #\\"Either this intelligible universe and the finite minds so well suited to grasp it are the products of intelligence, or both intelligibility and intelligence are the products of blind chance.\\" #\\"Not blind chance.\\" #\\"Therefore this intelligible universe and the finite minds so well suited to grasp it are the products of intelligence.\\" He compares his argument to C. S. Lewis' argument from reason. Platonic form The Christian philosopher Augustine of Hippo formed a formulation of the argument from consciousness, sometimes termed the Argument from truth which is closely aligned to consciousness, whilst using neither inductive nor deductive methodology. The argument was influenced by Platonism. #Our limited minds can discover eternal truths about being. #Truth properly resides in a mind. #But the human mind is not eternal. #Therefore there must exist an eternal mind in which these truths reside. The Catholic philosopher Peter Kreeft, whilst he feels that it could be an effective argument, feels that we have too little knowledge of the workings of consciousness for this to be truly convincing as of yet. http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics- more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm#11 Another Catholic philosopher, Edward Feser has promoted the Augustinian argument, including it in his book Five Proofs of the Existence of God. http://www.religioustolerance.org/case-for- god33.htm He concludes that Augustine's argument is valid, having given many different reasons why Platonism, its primary premise, is true. His inclusion of the argument led to an extremely critical review of his book on the existence of God to be published https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/13752 by Richard Carrier. His criticism is that Feser misunderstands the argument and confuses potentiality and actuality. Feser responded to Carrier's criticisms,http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2018/02/carrier-on-five-proofs.html saying, \\"Pop atheist writer Richard Carrier grandly claims to have “debunked!” (exclamation point in the original) Five Proofs of the Existence of God. It’s a bizarrely incompetent performance. To say that Carrier attacks straw men would be an insult to straw men, which usually bear at least a crude resemblance to the argument under consideration.\\" He deals with Carrier's objections, concluding the article by writing \\"It is hard to believe that Carrier actually read Five Proofs through, but I certainly did not bother to read the rest of his critique, judging that if what he has to say about the Aristotelian proof is this awful, it would be a waste of time and energy to proceed any further. If any reader has bothered to read it and found some gold among the dross, feel free to call our attention to it in the combox below.\\" Carrier himself responded https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/13830 to Feser's critique of his critique, by writing, \\"I had a good laugh when Feser fans claimed he “destroyed” my critique this week, and at first thought, “Oh gosh, did I get something wrong I need to correct?” And then I read his reply. Face, meet palm. Holy cow. His response is wildly inept. I’ll lay it out for you here.\\" Feser replied by writing, \\"Carrier’s self-confidence is so absurdly out of proportion to his actual competence that he does not realize that the only deathblows he delivers are of the self-inflicted kind. In particular, in no fewer than three places in his response, Carrier has inadvertently revealed himself to be either an extremely reckless liar or guilty of malpractice that would make any actual scholar (as opposed to the online hobbyist Carrier is) a professional laughingstock.\\" He pointed out in his article three places in which Carrier contradicts himself, and states that to reply any further to Carrier would be to give him more credit than he deserves. http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2018/03/carrier-carries-on.html#more Criticism The first premise, assertion that non-physical mental states exist, implies a dualist view of mind. Therefore, one line of attack is to argue the case for physicalism about the human mind.Melnyk, Andrew (2007). \\"A Case for Physicalism about the Human Mind\\" Moreland takes the arguments for the first premise and refers to classic defenses of dualism. However, the first premise is rejected by many philosophers of mind. Frank Jackson, known for the knowledge argument in support of dualism about the mind, comments on the debate between physicalist and dualist conceptions of mind: If one is willing to accept the first premise that reductive forms of physicalism are false, then the argument takes off. Thus, one could think of Moreland as making an argument that tries to move a person from \\"rejecting physicalism\\" to \\"accepting theism\\". The crucial step in this move is the fifth premise, which asserts that naturalism can not account for non-physical mental states. A critique of this premise is offered by Andrew Melnyk: However Moreland charges that such attempts to accommodate consciousness within an atheistic worldview are ad hoc and contrived and fail to take into account many features of conscious experience.Moreland,J.P. (2007). \\"Argument from consciousness\\" Moreland spends much of the book defending this premise against philosophers, such as Michael Martin, who accept pluralist naturalism. He also critiques contemporary philosophers of mind such as John Searle, Timothy O' Connor, Colin McGinn, David Skriba, Philip Clayton and Jaegwon Kim, who attempt to account for consciousness. Finally, one can also question premise eight: why does a personal explanation have to lead to monotheistic (as opposed to deistic or polytheistic) accounts of intention?Steven J. Conifer (2001). \\"The Argument from Consciousness Refuted\\". However, Moreland maintains that questioning these minor premises is of little consolation to the naturalist as they essentially constitute intramural theist debates, and that for most westerners theism is the only viable candidate to accommodate personal explanations. Similarly Occam's razor can be applied so only one personal agent is required.

USS Missouri fires her 16-inch guns The s were the most heavily armed gunships the United States Navy has ever put to sea due to the continual development of their onboard weaponry. The first Iowa-class ship was laid down in June 1940; in their World War II configuration, each of the Iowa-class battleships had a main battery of guns that could hit targets nearly 20 statute miles (32 km) away with a variety of artillery shells designed for anti-ship or bombardment work. The secondary battery of guns could hit targets nearly 9 statute miles (14 km) away with solid projectiles or proximity fuzed shells, and were effective in an anti-aircraft role as well. Each of the four battleships carried a wide array of 20 mm and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns for defense against enemy aircraft. When reactivated and modernized in the 1980s each battleship retained the original battery of nine guns, but the secondary battery on each battleship was reduced from ten twin-gun mounts and twenty guns to six twin- gun mounts with 12 guns to allow for the installation of two platforms for the Tomahawk missiles. Each battleship also received four Harpoon missile magazines, Phalanx anti-aircraft/anti-missile systems, and electronic warfare suites. Main battery=Turrets fires a full broadside of nine 16 inch (406 mm)/50-caliber and six 5-inch (127 mm)/38-caliber guns during a target exercise. There are concussion effects on the water surface, and the 16-inch (406 mm) gun barrels are in varying degrees of recoil. The primary armament of an Iowa-class battleship consisted of nine breech-loading 16 inch (406 mm)/50-caliber Mark 7 naval guns,Originally the armament was to be nine 16\\"/50 (406 mm) Mark 2 Naval Guns intended for the canceled s; however, a miscommunication between the design bureaus resulted in the Iowa class being equipped with the Mark 7 Naval Guns instead.

The guns were 66 feet (20 m) long (50 times their bore, or 50 calibers, from breechface to muzzle). About 43 feet (13 m) protruded from the gun house. Each gun weighed about 239,000 pounds (108 000 kg) without the breech, or 267,900 pounds with the breech.For comparison, the Space Shuttle, when fully loaded, weighs about 240,000 pounds, so each battleship gun is roughly the weight of a space shuttle.

They fired armor- piercing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , or high-capacity projectiles at , up to . Each gun rested within an armored turret, but only the top of the turret protruded above the main deck. The turret extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret. Each turret required a crew of 77–94 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to capsize the turrets would fall out.Underwater photos of show empty barbettes, vacated as the ship sank. John Asmussen. \\"Bismarck – The Wreck –'Part 5 – Aft & Rudder Area\\". Accessed 2007-03-25 Each turret cost US$1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves. Although frequently referred to as \\"triple gun\\" turrets, they were, in fact, classified as \\"three gun\\" turrets, due to the ability to elevate and fire each gun in the turret independently. This is as opposed to true \\"triple gun\\" turrets, in which all three guns must be operated as one. The ship could fire any combination of its guns, including a broadside of all nine. The guns could be elevated from −5° to +45°, moving at up to 12° per second. The turrets could be rotated about 300° at a rate of about four degrees per second and can even be fired back beyond the beam, which is sometimes called \\"over the shoulder.\\" The guns were never fired horizontally forward (in the 1980s refit, a satellite up-link antenna was mounted at the bow). To distinguish between the rounds fired from different battleships the Iowa class used dye bags which allowed artillery observers to determine which rounds had been fired by which ship. Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin were assigned the colors orange, blue, red and green, respectively. Within each turret, a red stripe on the interior wall, inches from the railing, marked the boundary of the barrel's recoil, warning the crew to keep back. Cut away of a gun turret When brought into service during World War II the guns had a barrel life of roughly 290 rounds, limited in large part by the nitrated cellulose (NC) propellant. After World War II the Navy switched to smokeless powder diphenylamine (SPD), a cooler-burning propellant, which increased the barrel life from 290 to about 350 rounds. This was increased further by the introduction of a titanium dioxide and wax compound known as \\"Swedish Additive\\" on for her tour in Vietnam, and later used on all four Iowas when they were reactivated in the 1980s. These measures were further augmented by the addition of polyurethane jackets, which were placed over the powder bags to reduce gaseous erosion during the firing of the guns. These measures greatly prolonged barrel life, and ultimately resulted in a shift from measuring barrel life in equivalent service rounds (ESR) to measuring barrel life in fatigue equivalent rounds (FER). After the guns were fired, each barrel had to be cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class battleship could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning them required a full day or more to ensure that the barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the barrels, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the barrels. USS Iowas Fire Control Tower under construction in 1942 Fire control The early main battery fire control consisted of the Fire Control Tower, two Mark 38 Gun Fire Control Systems (GFCS), and fire control equipment located in two of the three turrets. As modernized in the 1980s, each turret carried a DR-810 radar that measured the muzzle velocity of each gun, which made it easier to predict the velocity of succeeding shots. Together with the Mark 160 FCS and better propellant consistency, the improvements created the most accurate battleship- caliber guns ever made. =Mark 38 gun fire control system= The major components of the Mk 38 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS) were the Director, Plotting Room, and interconnecting data transmission equipment. Two systems, forward and aft, were each complete and independent, though they could be cross-connected. Their plotting rooms were isolated to protect against battle damage propagating from one to the other. Director Mark 38 Director The forward Mk 38 Director (pictured) was situated on top of the fire control tower. The director was equipped with Mark 45 Rangefinder optical sights (the long thin boxes protruding from each side), and a Mark 13 Fire Control Radar antenna (the rectangular shaped box on top). The purpose of the Director was to track the target's present bearing and range. This could be done electronically with the radar (the preferred method), or optically by the men inside using the sights and Rangefinder. The present position of the target was called the Line-Of-Sight (LOS), and it was continuously sent down to the Mk 8 Rangekeeper in the plotting room by Synchro transmitters. When not using the radar's display to determine Spots, the director was the optical spotting station. Plotting room USS Missouris Main Plot, c1950 The forward main battery plotting room was located below the waterline and inside the armored belt. It housed the forward system's Mark 8 Rangekeeper, Mark 41 Stable Vertical, Mk13 FC Radar controls and displays, Parallax Correctors, Fire Control Switchboard, battle telephone switchboard, battery status indicators, assistant Gunnery Officers, and Fire Control Technicians (FTs). Mark 8 Rangekeeper The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an electromechanical analog computer whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), to hit a future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between \\"OWN SHIP\\" and \\"TARGET\\". It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position at the end of the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered. Mark 41 Stable Vertical The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a vertical seeking gyroscope. Its function was to establish and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly. The Mk 13 FC Radar supplied present target range, and it showed the fall of shot around the target so the Gunnery Officer could correct the system's aim with range and deflection spots put into the Rangekeeper. It could also automatically track the target by controlling the director's bearing power drive. Because of radar, Fire Control systems are able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy during the day, night, or inclement weather. This was demonstrated in November 1942 when the battleship engaged the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser Kirishima at a range of at night. The engagement left Kirishima in flames, and she was ultimately scuttled by her crew. This capability gave the United States Navy a major advantage in World War II, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy and were at a significant disadvantage. See also The Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944) during the WWII Leyte Gulf landings. Fire Control Switchboard The Parallax Correctors were needed because the turrets were located hundreds of feet from the director. There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and Target Range. They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point. The Fire Control Switchboard configured the battery. With it, the Gunnery Officer could mix and match the three turrets to the two GFCSs. He could have the turrets all controlled by the forward system, all controlled by the aft system, or split the battery to shoot at two targets. The assistant Gunnery Officers and Fire Control Technicians operated the equipment, talked to the turrets and ship's command by sound-powered telephone, and watched the Rangekeeper's dials and system status indicators for problems. If a problem arose, they could correct the problem, or reconfigure the system to mitigate its effect. =Turret fire control systems= Turrets 2 and 3 had optical rangefinders and ballistics computers. (The rangefinders are the boxes on the turret's rear corners). If in a surface action the GFCSs were damaged, the Turret Officer could turn the Auto-Local rotary switch to Local and continue the action using the turret's fire control equipment. Ammunition 16-inch naval gunfire shells The large caliber guns were designed to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti- structure work and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. A third type of ammunition for delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently. The Mk. 8 APC (Armor- Piercing, Capped) shell weighed 2,700 lb (1225 kg) and was designed to penetrate the hardened steel armor carried by foreign battleships. At 20,000 yards (18 km) the Mk. 8 could penetrate 20 inches (500 mm) of steel armor plate.William H. Garzke and Robert O. Dulin, Jr. Battleships: United States Battleships 1935–1992 At the same range, the Mk. 8 could penetrate 21 feet (6.4 m) of reinforced concrete. For unarmored targets and shore bombardment, the 1,900 lb (862 kg) Mk. 13 HC (High-Capacity – referring to the large bursting charge) shell was available. The Mk. 13 shell would create a crater 50 feet (15 m) wide and 20 feet (6 m) deep upon impact and detonation, and could defoliate trees 400 yards (360 m) from the point of impact. Mk. 13 High Capacity shells that were made by manufacturers other than the Naval Gun Factory received the designation Mk. 14 HC, but were otherwise identical. The final type of ammunition developed for the Iowa class were \\"Katie\\" shells. These shells were born from the concept of nuclear deterrence that had begun to shape the United States armed forces as the Cold War began. To compete with the Air Force and the Army, which had developed nuclear bombs and nuclear shells for use on the battlefield, the US Navy began a top-secret program to develop Mk. 23 nuclear naval shells with an estimated yield of 15 to 20 kilotons. These shells were designed to be launched from the best seaborne artillery platform available, which at the time were the four ships of the Iowa class. The shells entered development around 1953, and were reportedly ready by 1956; it is not known whether they were ever deployed on the Iowa- class battleships because the US Navy does not confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships. In 1991 the US unilaterally withdrew its nuclear artillery shells from service, and Russia responded in kind in 1992. The US removed around 1,300 nuclear shells from Europe and reportedly dismantled its last shells by 2003. File:USS Iowa (BB-61) projectile hoisted to spanning tray.jpgLoading shell, 1986.

Secondary battery The secondary battery was a dual-purpose weapon system, meaning that it was designed to defend the ship from either surface or aerial threats. The original secondary battery consisted of 10 Mark 28, Mod 2 twin gun mounts, and four Mark 37 Gun Fire Control Systems. At first, this battery's effectiveness against aircraft diminished as planes became faster, but this changed toward the end of World War II through a combination of an upgrade to the Mk37 System and the development of the VT (Variable Time) proximity fuze. In preparation for the reactivations in the 1960s and 1980s, the battery was updated to the latest gun and fire control system modifications. In the 1968 upgrade to USS New Jersey for service off Vietnam, three Mark 56 Gun Fire Control Systems were installed, two on either side just forward of the aft stack, and one between the aft mast and the aft Mk 38 Director tower. This increased New Jersey's anti-aircraft capability, because the Mk 56 system could track and shoot at faster planes. In the 1980s modernization, the Mk 56 GFCSs and four mounts were removed to make room for missiles, leaving the Secondary battery with four Mk 37 GFCSs and six twin mounts on all the Iowa class. By the time of the Gulf War the secondary battery was largely relegated to shore bombardment and littoral defense. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun mounts. Mark 28, Mod 2 mounts A 5-inch (127 mm) gun mount emblazoned with the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor of the United States Marine Corps aboard the battleship 5-inch gun aboard the Iowa-class battleship Each Mk 28 Mod 2 Mount carried two Mark 12, 5in/38cal gun assemblies, electric-hydraulic drives for bearing and elevation, optical sights, automatic fuze setter, automatic sight setter, and an upper handling room. Each armored twin mount weighed . The mount had a crew of 13, not including the ammunition movers in the upper handling room and magazines, drawn from the sailors and Marines serving aboard the ship. =Mark 12 gun assembly= Mk 12 Gun Assembly (right gun) 5in/38cal semi-fixed ammunition. Anti-aircraft Common (AAC) Projectile with Full Service Charge. The Mk 12 Gun Assembly (pictured) was a semi-automatic, power rammed, vertical sliding-wedge breech block type gun. The Gun Assembly shown in the picture is the mount's right gun. The left gun is the mirror image of the right gun. Since this gun assembly fired semi-fixed ammunition, (pictured) each round was delivered to the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric- hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. At the load command, the powder man would slip a primer protector off the end of the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's rammer tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, and place it in the rammer tray in front of the powder case. Then, as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever. This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot treadle. When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position, and the rammer would drive back to the rear of the rammer tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded. =Electric-hydraulic drives= The electric-hydraulic drives powered the mount's motion. The three modes of drive operation were automatic, local, and manual. In automatic, the drives would follow the bearing and elevation orders of the fire control system. In local, the drives would follow the motion of the trainer's and pointer's hand wheels. (This is similar to power steering on a car.) Manual was direct gear linkage from the hand wheels to move the mount with no power assist. =Sights= The periscopic sights (the boxes on the side of the mount) allowed the trainer and pointer to see the target from inside the armored enclosure. Each sight had movable prisms that allowed its line of sight to be moved relative to the barrel's bore axis. These prisms could be controlled by the fire control system when the mount was in Automatic, or by the mount's sight setter operator when the mount was in Local. Local control was not the preferred combat method, but it could be used if the fire control systems were damaged. The mount captain was trained in aiming and correcting the fall of shot. =Upper handling room= The upper handling room was just below the visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support the weight of the mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In the center of the room there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines. Mark 37 gun fire control system Mk 37 Director The Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS) was the primary Fire Control System for the Secondary Battery. There were four Mk37 GFCSs on board; one forward above the navigation bridge, two amidships on either side of the forward stack, and one aft between the aft Mk38 Director and Turret three. The major components of the Mk 37 GFCS were the Mk 37 Director, and the equipment in the plotting room. =Mark 37 director= The function of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna on the left is for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target. =Plotting room= The secondary battery plotting rooms were down below the waterline and inside the armor belt. They contained four complete sets of fire control equipment needed to aim and shoot at four targets. Each set included a Mark 1A computer, a Mark 6 Stable Element, fire-control radar controls and displays, Parallax correctors, a switchboard, and crew to operate it all. Mark 1A Computer The Mark 1A Fire Control Computer (pictured) was an electro-mechanical analog ballistic computer. Its function was to automatically aim the guns so that a fired projectile would collide with the target. This was the same function as the main battery's Mk 8 Rangekeeper above except that some of the targets the Mark 1A had to deal with also moved in elevation – and much faster. For a surface target, the Secondary Battery's Fire Control problem is the same as the Main Battery's with the same type inputs and outputs. The major difference between the two computers was their ballistics calculations. The amount of gun elevation needed to project a 5-inch (127 mm) shell is different than the elevation needed to project a 16-inch shell the same distance. The ballistics calculations in these mechanical analog computers were performed by mechanisms like differential gears, levers, and small rods riding on the surface of three-dimensional cams. These mechanical adders, multipliers, and table lookup devices were handmade at the factory, and were buried deep in the workings of the computer. It was not possible to change a computer's ballistics at sea until the advent of fast digital computers. The anti-aircraft fire control problem was more complicated because it had the additional requirement of tracking the target in elevation and making target predictions in three dimensions. The outputs of the Mk 1A were the same (gun bearing and elevation), except fuze time was added. The fuze time was needed because the ideal of directly hitting the fast moving aircraft with the projectile was impractical. With fuze time set into the shell, it was hoped that it would explode near enough to the target to destroy it with the shock wave and shrapnel. Towards the end of World War II, the invention of the VT proximity fuze eliminated the need to use the fuze time calculation and its possible error. This greatly increased the odds of destroying an air target. Mark 6 Stable Element The function of the Mk 6 Stable Element (pictured) in this fire control system was the same as the function of the Mk 41 Stable Vertical in the main battery system above. It was a vertical seeking gyroscope that supplied the system with a stable up direction on a rolling and pitching ship. In surface mode, it replaced the director's elevation signal. It also had the surface mode firing keys. The fire-control radar used on the Mk 37 GFCS has evolved. In the 1930s, the Mk 37 Director did not have a radar antenna. Then in September 1941,Naval Weapons of WW2, Campbell, p111. the rectangular Mk 4 fire-control radar antenna was mounted on top. Soon aircraft flew faster, and in to increase speed and accuracy the Mk 4 was replaced by a combination of the Mk 12 (rectangular antenna) and Mk 22 (parabolic antenna) radars. (pictured) Finally, the circular SPG 25 antenna was mounted on top as seen in the USS Wisconsin photo at the top of this article. (Look at the Mk 37 Director just above the bridge.) Anti-aircraft batteries An Oerlikon 20 mm anti-aircraft gun aboard the battleship . Since they were designed to escort the US fleet of fast attack aircraft carriers, the Iowa-class battleships were all intended to carry a fearsome array of anti-aircraft guns to protect US aircraft carriers from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. This array included up to 20 quad 40 mm mounts and 49 single 20 mm mounts. In the 1968 USS New Jersey re-activation for service off Vietnam, the 20 mm and 40 mm batteries were removed. In the 1980s re-activation, all the ships with 20 mm and 40 mm batteries had them removed, and four Phalanx CIWS mounts were added to all. Oerlikon 20 mm anti-aircraft guns The Oerlikon 20 mm anti-aircraft gun was one of the most heavily produced anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War; the US alone manufactured a total of 124,735 of these guns. When activated in 1941 these guns replaced the 0.50\\"/90 (12.7 mm) M2 Browning MG on a one-for-one basis. The Oerlikon 20 mm AA gun remained the primary anti- aircraft weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the 40 mm Bofors AA gun in 1943. These guns were air-cooled and used a gas blowback recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II the barrel of the 20 mm Oerlikon gun did not recoil, the breechblock never locked against the breech and actually moved forward when the gun fired. This weapon lacked a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil was checked by the explosion of the next round of ammunition. Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns on a MK 12 quadruple mount fire from the deck of in World War II. Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon, with the high point being 48.3% for the second half of 1942. In 1943 the revolutionary Mark 14 Gun Sight was introduced which made these guns even more effective; however, the 20 mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II. They were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier 40 mm Bofors AA guns. Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns Mark 51 Director with Mark 14 (40 mm) Gun Sight Arguably the best light anti-aircraft weapon of World War II, the Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun was used on almost every major warship in the US and UK fleet during World War II from about 1943 to 1945. Although a descendant of German and Swedish designs, the Bofors mounts used by the US Navy during World War II had been heavily \\"Americanized\\" to bring the guns up to the standards placed on them by the US Navy. This resulted in a guns system set to English standards (now known as the Standard System) with interchangeable ammunition, which simplified the logistics situation for World War II. When coupled with electric-hydraulic drives for greater speed and the Mark 51 Director (pictured) for improved accuracy, the Bofors 40 mm gun became a fearsome adversary, accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945. When the Iowa-class battleships were launched in 1943 and 1944 they carried twenty quad Bofors 40 mm gun mounts, which they used for defense against enemy aircraft. These heavy guns were also employed in the protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific Theater of World War II. These guns remained on the battleships Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin from the time they were commissioned until they were reactivated for service in the 1980s.USS New Jersey had her 40 mm guns removed in 1968 when she was called into action for the Vietnam War. Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships – New Jersey Retrieved 30 March 2007 As each battleship arrived for modernization during the early and mid-1980s the Bofors mounts that remained aboard were removed due in large part to the ineffectiveness of such manually aimed weapons against modern day jet fighters and enemy missiles. The replacement for the Bofors guns was the US Navy's Phalanx Close-in weapon system (CIWS). Phalanx CIWS A Phalanx CIWS mount aboard the amphibious assault ship . During their modernization in the 1980s, each Iowa-class battleship was equipped with four of the US Navy's Phalanx CIWS mounts, two of which sat just behind the bridge and two which were forward and outboard of the after ship's funnel. , , and were equipped with the Block 0 version of the Phalanx, while received the first operational Block 1 version in 1988. Developed as the final line of defense (terminal defense or point defense) against anti-ship missiles, the Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS, pronounced \\"sea-whiz\\") is the anti-aircraft/anti-missile gun currently in use in the US Navy. Due to their distinctive shape, they have been nicknamed \\"R2D2s\\", in reference to the droid R2-D2 from the Star Wars universe. Designed in the early 1970s by General Dynamics, and currently produced by Raytheon, the Phalanx CIWS mount utilizes a 20 mm M61 Vulcan Gatling-style cannon to destroy enemy missiles and aircraft that manage to escape surface-to-air missiles fired from friendly ships. The Phalanx guns work by using a search radar and a tracking radar to follow targets that approach within 1 to of the vessel. When a target is within this range the CIWS mount moves to track the target while simultaneously evaluating the target against several preset criteria to determine the next course of action. Depending on whether the target criteria are met, the Phalanx mount automatically engages the incoming target if it is judged to be hostile in nature, or the system recommends that the Phalanx operator engage the target. Phalanx CIWS mounts were used by Missouri and Wisconsin during the 1991 Gulf War; Wisconsin alone fired 5,200 20 mm Phalanx CIWS rounds. Missouri also received Phalanx fire during a \\"friendly fire\\" incident in which the guided missile frigate mistook chaff fired by Missouri for a legitimate target and shot at Missouri. Rounds from this attack struck the ship in the bulkhead above the famed \\"surrender deck\\" and bounced off the armor, one round penetrated the forward funnel and passed completely through it, and another round penetrated a bulkhead and embedded in an interior passageway of the ship. Missiles During the modernization in the 1980s, three new weapons were added to the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.Statement by Admiral Rowden in the Department of Defense Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1982. . Tomahawk land attack missile An Armored Box Launcher equipped on the battleship . The BGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) was first introduced in the 1970s, and entered service with the United States in 1983. Designed as a long-range, all- weather, subsonic cruise missile, the Tomahawk was capable of reaching targets at a much greater range than the guns on the Iowa-class ships. When added to the battleships in the 1980s the Tomahawk became the longest-ranged weapon carried by the battleships.The maximum range for the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile is , the maximum range for the Harpoon was , (Iowa Class: Missile Battery. battleship.org, Retrieved on 2007-03-25) and the maximum range for the guns was .(USS Missouri (BB-63) FAQ. factplace.com, Retrieved on 2007-03-25) Owing to the original 1938 design of the battleships, the Tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to the Iowa class unless the battleships were physically rebuilt in such a way as to accommodate the missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch the Tomahawks. This realization prompted the removal of the anti-aircraft guns previously installed on the Iowas and the removal of four of each of the battleships' ten 5\\"/38 DP mounts. The mid and aft end of the battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile magazines. This resulted in the construction of two separate platforms, one located between the first and second funnel and one located behind the second funnel, to which MK-143 Armored Box Launcher (ABL) canisters could be attached. Each Armored Box Launcher carried four missiles, and each of the battleships was outfitted with eight canisters, enabling the Iowa-class to carry and fire a total of 32 Tomahawk missiles. The type of Tomahawk carried by the battleships varied, as there were three basic configurations for the Tomahawk: the Anti-Ship Missile (TASM), the Land-Attack Missile-Conventional (TLAM-C), and the Land-Attack Missile-Nuclear (TLAM-N). Each version was similar in appearance and used the same airframe body and launcher. The conventional Tomahawk missile could carry a explosive warhead or submunitions which used the missile body to reach their destination. The nuclear variant carried a 200 kt W80 nuclear warhead. The TLAM could be equipped with an inertial and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) radar guidance package to find and destroy its target. The TERCOM radar used a stored map reference to compare with the actual terrain to determine the missile's position. If necessary, a course correction was then made to place the missile on course to the target. Terminal guidance in the target area was provided by the optical Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system, which compared a stored image of target with the actual target image. The firing weight of the Tomahawk was plus a booster. It had a cruising speed of 0.5 Mach and an attack speed of 0.75 Mach. The anti-ship version of the Tomahawk had an operating range of and a maximum range of , while the conventional land attack missile version had a maximum range of and TLAM-N had maximum range of . During the 1991 Gulf War, USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin used ABL launchers to fire Tomahawk missiles at Iraqi targets during Operation Desert Storm. Wisconsin served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and fired a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. Harpoon anti-ship missile Two Harpoon Missile Launchers and a Phalanx CIWS on the USS New Jersey For protection against enemy ships, the Iowa class was outfitted with the Harpoon Weapons System. The system consisted of four Mk 141 \\"shock-hardened\\" quad cell launchers designed to carry and fire the McDonnell Douglas RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile. Each Harpoon was placed in one of four Mk 141 launchers located alongside the aft stack; eight per side, in two pods of four. The weight of the Harpoon at firing was , which included a booster weighing about . The cruising speed was 0.87 Mach and the maximum range was in Range and Bearing Launch mode and in Bearing Only Launch mode. When an Iowa-class battleship fired a Harpoon missile, a booster propelled the missile away from the ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System. The battleships carried and used the RGM/UGM-84 variants of the Harpoon missile, which was designed to be fired by surface ships. The version used a solid-fueled rocket booster in an A/B44G-2 or -3 booster section, which was discarded after burn-out. The maximum range was around . After launch, the missile was guided towards the target location as determined by the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely- known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM). An alternative launch mode was called Bearing-Only Launch (BOL). In this mode, the missile was launched in the general direction of the target, and its radar activated from the beginning to scan for the target in a +/- 45° sector in front of the flight path. Once a target was located and the seeker locked the xGM-84A missile climbed rapidly to about 1800 m before diving on the target in what was known as a \\"pop-up maneuver\\". The 221 kg (488 lb) WDU-18/B penetrating blast-fragmentation warhead (in the WAU-3(V) /B warhead section) was triggered by a time-delayed impact fuze. When no target was acquired after radar activation, the Harpoon would self- destruct.

Ryan vs. Dorkman Ryan vs. Dorkman was produced as an entry in a lightsaber choreography competition hosted by TheForce.net, a prominent Star Wars fan site noted for its fan film- making community. According to the official TFN entry for the film, the backstory involves Ryan and Michael, or \\"Ryan_W\\" and \\"DorkmanScott\\" as they are known on TheForce.net's forums, meeting after their friendly online rivalry over who is the better saber artist escalates too far. The fight to the death will determine once and for all who is the most skilled with a saber. In mid-2006, the short became a viral video after being posted on such websites as eBaumsworld, CollegeHumor, and the front page of YouTube as a \\"Featured Video.\\" The YouTube video, which passed one million views by January 30 had over five million views as of March 2010. There were also versions uploaded to Google Video and other sites. In early 2008 Wieber and Scott re- mastered \\"RvD\\" and made it available for download on the official site. The re-mastering involved removing the \\"greenish-yellow wash,\\" re-doing some effects, fixing rotoscoping errors, reversing the effects from the de- interlacing (which gave diagonal lines a \\"jagged\\" look), re-framing certain cuts and upgrading the audio track from a loud mono track to a softer stereo track. A more detailed explanation of the remastering process was also posted on the site. Both Ryan and 'Dorkman' were featured in the music video for Weezer's 2008 song \\"Pork and Beans\\" which included many other internet video stars.  Ryan vs. Dorkman 2  Wieber and Scott announced in May 2006 that they would be producing a sequel. Ryan vs. Dorkman 2 (RvD2) was shot in Atlanta, Georgia in August 2006, and featured several technical improvements over the original RvD, such as the fact that it was shot in 24p high- definition, as opposed to the original's 30p standard definition. The lightsaber blades also interact with the environment in the form of sparks, burns and other effects which were not present in the original. These were made in collaboration with Bob Forward. The film's score was recorded with a 57 piece orchestra at Capitol Studios in Hollywood. To accomplish this goal, film composers Gordy Haab and Kyle Newmaster donated their time and talents to the project. The film's creators solicited donations from fans in order to pay the musicians. M.B Gordy (lead percussionist from Battlestar Galactica) provided the percussion. The film premiered February 24, 2007 at the Wilshire Fine Arts Theatre in Los Angeles, with a screening at the New York Comic Con the following day. The film was released on the internet on March 1, 2007, with a soundtrack DC release later that summer. Within one year, it acquired over 2 million YouTube views and underwent a re-release in full HD. The film was entered into the 2008 Star Wars Fan Movie Challenge, where it won Best Visual Effects. In August 2010, Time magazine listed it as one of the Top 10 Star Wars fanfilms. Ryan vs. Dorkman 3 In a behind-the-scenes video from Wieber and Scott, they commented on possible plans to do a Ryan vs. Dorkman 3 sometime in the future. No official timetable has been set, but Wieber and Scott claim that they will do it when they obtain more ideas on how they want the third battle to shape up. They have further stated that while they could make a third lightsaber battle now, it would basically be considered a \\"clone\\" of RvD2 with no real advancement in special effects and filmmaking. In October, 2014, Michael Scott was injured by a car accident, and as of December is still hospitalized, though making progress. This leaves the fate of Ryan vs. Dorkman 3 unknown. Michael Scott has recovered from his injuries, but may never rehabilitate to his previous physical or mental condition. ReferencesExternal links  Interview with Ryan and Dorkman on Geekza.

He is known for his novel Darconville's Cat (1981), which was selected by Anthony Burgess for his Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English since 1939 – A Personal Choice in 1984, and by Larry McCaffery for 20th Century’s Greatest Hits. He was awarded the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction in 1991 and the Clifton Fadiman Medal for Fiction in 2002 by the Mercantile Library in New York City. He is the brother of novelist Paul Theroux and writer Peter Theroux, and uncle of documentarian Louis Theroux, novelist Marcel Theroux, and actor Justin Theroux. Life and career=Early life Theroux was born in Medford, Massachusetts, the first son of Catholic parents; his mother, Anne (born Dittami), was Italian American, and his father, Albert Eugene Theroux, was French Canadian. His mother was a grammar school teacher and his father was a salesman for the American Leather Oak company. Theroux graduated from Medford High School; he attended Boys State in Amherst, Massachusetts, was class president in 1956, and was a starting member of the Medford High School basketball team. He entered the Trappist Monastery at St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts in 1958, and then the Franciscan Seminary at Callicoon, New York in 1960. He earned his BA at St. Francis College in 1964. He earned an MA in English literature in 1965, and his PhD in English literature, 1968 at the University of Virginia, where he won the Schubert Playwrighting Fellowship in 1967. He belonged to both the Raven Society and the Society of the Purple Shadows. He spent a year on a Fulbright Grant in London, England in 1969. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1974. He taught at the University of Virginia in 1968, and at Harvard University as Brigg-Copeland Lecturer from 1973 to 1979. He was writer-in-residence at Phillips Academy in Andover from 1979 to 1982. He taught at MIT from 1982 to 1987, and at Yale University from 1987 to 1991. He has also lived in England, Estonia, and France. Literary work His first novel, Three Wogs, was written during a stay in London and was briefly considered by the actor, Roy Dotrice for performance by BBC television. His second novel, Darconville’s Cat, was nominated for the National Book Award. He published the fable, Master Snickup’s Cloak, which was illustrated by Brian Froud, in 1979. That followed two other fables, The Schinocephalic Waif and The Wragby Cars, with illustrations by Stan Washburn in 1975. In 1987 he published An Adultery. His longest, most satirical novel, Laura Warholic was published in 2007. His non- fiction books on color, The Primary Colors (1994) and The Secondary Colors (1996), were briefly on the best-seller list in Los Angeles. As a writer, he is known for his encyclopedic, highly allusive style and learned wit. Critic Colin Marshall wrote, “Defending of his prose, Theroux once likened it to 'a Victorian attic.' He delivers more inner life than outer, more desire for vengeance than for anything else, and more sheer stuff per page—stuff you don't expect—than in any other novels.” Literary broadcaster Michael Silverblatt once questioned Theroux’s 'perverse appreciation' at how inaccessible his books are thought to be. > “Perhaps he sees his finely-wrought works of language and their lack of > purchase on the culture as an apocalyptic indictment of that culture, of the > intellectually (and especially verbally) careless society that could corrupt > them. Were I him, I feel as if I’d want revenge: against lazy readers, > against unengaged critics, against risk-averse publishers. But maybe, given > what they’re all missing out on, he’s already taking it.” Alex Kurtagić wrote on his blog in 2009, > “At my wedding, my cousin Pierre remarked upon the fact that when in my > teens I used to enjoy reading dictionaries and collecting rare, antique, and > obscure words (a criterion that defines my collecting in other areas as > well). Several such dictionaries consisted purely of such words, and one of > them helpfully illustrated their usage with quotes by modern authors.

Plagiarism controversy In 1995, The New York Times reported that one of its readers had noted the similarity of six passages in Theroux's 1994 survey of The Primary Colors with a 1954 book Song of the Sky by Guy Murchie. Theroux attributed the matter to \\"stupidity and bad note taking,\\" noting that he had read hundreds of books for The Primary Colors. Theroux's editor said that future editions would credit Murchie's work, or remove the passages.The New York Times, 3 March 1995, A Reader Finds That a Current Book Reads Suspiciously Like an Old OneSan Francisco Chronicle, 4 March 1995, Author of \`Colors' Accused of Plagiarism A few months later, Theroux published a lengthy defense in the San Diego Reader.

Novo Selo is also the name of the village where the municipal seat is found. Novo Selo means \\"New Village\\" in Macedonian. Novo Selo Municipality is part of the Southeastern statistical region. Demographics According to the last national census from 2002, this municipality has 11,567 inhabitants.2002 census results in English and Macedonian (PDF) Ethnic groups in the municipality include: *Macedonians = 11,509 (99.5%) *others = 58 (0.5%) Inhabited places *Novo Selo (seat) *Badilen *Bajkovo *Barbarevo *Borisovo *Draževo *Kolešino *Mokrievo *Mokrino *Novo Konjarevo *Samoilovo *Smolari *Staro Konjarevo *Stinik *Sušica *Zubovo History The fertile soil, mild temperate climate and abundance of water and forest have offered favourable conditions for food and settlement of people since the ancient times. According to the historic evidence, it is believed that ever since the 5th century B.C. this region was inhabited by the Tracian (Peon) Tribes, and from their name, the region itself was called Paeonia. During these centuries, at the south of Peonia, the ancient Macedonian country was founded and started the expansion to the north. This country flourished during the reign of Philip and Alexander the Great. In the period from the 5th to 7th centuries, the region was inhabited by the Macedonian Slavs from the Strumjani Tribe. They were frequently attacked by other aggressor tribes, and as a result of the continuous attacks, Novo Selo was often forced to change its location. The first name of the settlement that can be found is “Volčji Dol,” after which the name “Selište” followed. It was named Yeniköy during Ottoman rule. Towards the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, during the period when the Ottoman Empire began to weaken, there was another movement to the location where Yeniköy (\\"New Village\\" for Turkish) is situated today. During the reign of the Ottoman Empire, Manus Georgiev Turnovski and Ivan Iliev Ajdinski were famous leaders from Novo Selo. On 6 April 1941, at the time of the Second World War, Novo Selo was conquered by the German Army. According to the agreement of alliance that Germany had with Bulgaria, Novo Selo was under the occupation of the Bulgarian Army. The Macedonian people, including the people who lived in the settlements surrounding Novo Selo, unsatisfied with the occupation by the Fascist counties, initiated war activities against them. During the February Expedition, the partisan troops, led by Mihajlo Apostoloski, crossed the Ograzden Mountain, collided with the German Army in the “Kitka” locality, and succeeded in breaking through the enclosure. Then they proceeded through the village of Novo Konjarevo and the Belasica Mountain. On 10 September 1944 the Bulgarian Army left Novo Selo. Tourist attractions Koleshino Waterfall Koleshino Waterfall The Koleshino Waterfall can be found at an elevation of , on the Baba River in the heart of the Belasica Mountain, surrounded by maple trees and stone cliffs. The water of this waterfall falls from the height of . Smolare Waterfall Smolare Waterfall The Smolare Waterfall is found above the village of Smolare, at an elevation of , located deep in the Belasica Mountain where the Lomnica River springs from among the hundred-year- old beech wood trees. The water falls from the height of , the tallest in the country. A pedestrian path was constructed in May 2003 to make the waterfall accessible to visitors. It is long, and has 300 stairs built from local stone, one small wooden bridge and one gazebo with a span of . Along the whole length of the path there is a wooden fence built from the local materials. Mokrino Springs Mokrino Springs is found at the foot of the Belasica Mountain at an elevation of in the immediate vicinity of the village of Mokrino. Clear mountain water springs from the roots of the hundred-year-old trees at a capacity of sixty litres a second. Crveno Pole or Red Field The archeological site, “Crveno Pole” or “Red Field” is located 15 km north of the Municipal center of Novo Selo, north of the village Barbarevo. It is high in the Ograzden Mountain at an elevation of . On a plateau in the center of Red Field, there is a dispersed settlement. On the field of a few hectares there are found a few objects revealing the life and local economy of the ancient residents. The Belogasica River divides the settlement into two parts, the northern part named Janina Cheshma, (“Jane’s Tap”) and the southern part named Papri. Janina Cheshma is located in the western part of the settlement with a rectangular shape oriented north-south and measuring . The tap was used from the 1st to 3rd centuries. Papri has two archeological objects. The first object is located on the southern part of the settlement. It is the remains of a foundation from a building that was constructed on a rock shelf. The foundation was made with stone and earth. The outdoor site surrounding the foundation has the remains of additional walls. The second object was built from stone and mud walls, using the construction technique “opus incertum.” Both objects were built on the rock and they follow the curve of the rock to the south. They are anchored in the rock, and therefore they are very stable. Southeast of the settlement is the location of Gradishte. On the top of a hill, that has steep and inaccessible cliffs, lies the remains of a “castrum,” a defensive fort to provide protection to the citizens in case of danger. Remains of the foundation reveal the massive fortification of the structure. A necropolis is positioned on the first hill from the southeast. It is known by the local citizens as “Goosharova Chookarka”, which means “Lizard Hill”. Stone crowns mark the graves on the surface of the earth. Burial in this necropolis started in 100 A.D. and lasted until the end of the 300 A.D. Fifty meters west of the Lizard Hill necropolis, there is the remains of another necropolis with different burial rituals, named Spasov’s Hill. The graves here were dug in the rock and the same rock was used to entomb the sites with a stone plate. This place was used as a necropolis starting in the 4th century. Jane Sandanski House of Culture The Municipality of Novo Selo hosts a cultural institution called the Jane Sandanski House of Culture. The House of Culture has operated for twenty years and provides the community with cultural activities, along with presentations, in the areas of painting, drama, theatre and music, literature, and education. Festivals=St. George's Day Meetings The St. George's Day Meetings have a tradition lasting several years, and they take place every year on May 5, one day before the great Christian festival St. George's Day, when most of the settlements from the Municipality of Novo Selo have village family feasts. There is also a parade of national costumes and folk-dancing group competition on this day. After the parade, the folk- dancing groups, having their own repertoire, perform in front of an audience. Ensembles from the all over North Macedonia attend these Meetings, and in the past few years, they have become international since groups from the neighboring countries attend place as well. The Meetings are under the patronage of the Mayor of the Municipality of Novo Selo and are organised by the Jane Sandanski House of Culture from Novo Selo. Ilinden's Meetings On the day of the Macedonian holiday Ilinden (August 2), the centuries-old tradition of the Ilinden Meetings take place every year. These Meetings are organised in the village of Mokrino, situated in the heart of the Belasica Mountain under the hundred-year-old maple trees at the site of the Mokrino Springs. On the day of the Meetings, the people, who once lived in Mokrino, come back home in order to be there for the event. On the same day, the Council of the Village makes a sacrifice as a tribute to the Prophet St. Ilija, and the inhabitants believe that by making this sacrifice, the Prophet will protect them from evil during the whole year. Gathering on St. Petka's Day On the day of the Christian festival St. Petka’s Day (October 27) in the eponymous monastery in the village of Bajkovo, there is a nationwide gathering. On this day, the monastery organises lunch for all the visitors as a tribute to St. Petka. There are people from the whole country at this gathering who come to pay tribute to the Saint. Meeting Under the Maple Trees On June 6, as a tribute to the writer Vidoe Podgorec, the traditional meeting under the maple trees is organized in his birthplace, Koleshino. A number of writers from the whole country come to the Meeting, when excerpts from the works of the author are read. The Meeting is organized by the Grigor Prlicev Primary School from Koleshino.

He joined the Irish Republican Army in the 1950s, and was a founder member and a leader of the Provisional Irish Republican Army in the early 1970s. Personal life John Kelly was born in Belfast, County Antrim, in 1936. Later in life he moved to Maghera, County Londonderry, where he lived until his death in 2007. He and his wife had a daughter. He was a dedicated member of local Gaelic Athletic Association club Watty Graham's Glen and a keen supporter of Gaelic games and the Irish language. IRA member Kelly joined the IRA in the early 1950s when he was 18 and took part in the Border Campaign of 1956–62, but was arrested in December 1956 and was imprisoned until 1963. He was a member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1967–69 which led on to sectarian riots in Belfast. A leader of the newly formed Provisional IRA in 1969, he was involved in the formation of \\"citizens' defence groups\\" to protect nationalist areas of Belfast from loyalist rioters who were largely unhampered by the police. Prison record He was jailed on three occasions for IRA related activity spending a total of fifteen years in prison in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. His first term was for his activity in the 1956 IRA border campaign, He also served a six-month term in 1973 in the Republic of Ireland for being a member of the IRA.Tributes to Provisional IRA founder and former MLA The News Letter Accessed 11 September 2007 Commenting later on the Troubles, he said: \\"Yes, it was a terrible period. But you can't turn the clock back. The Irish government did not create the Provisional IRA. What happened was as inevitable as the changing seasons.\\"Irish Times, 7 September 2007, p. 10 Arms Trial The citizens' defence groups sought help from the government in Dublin in 1969, then led by Jack Lynch. Several ministers responded and arranged a fund of £100,000 but the planned arms shipment failed. Kelly later said: \\"These discussions were all about guns. The whole thing was government-sponsored, government-backed and government-related.\\" The planning included travel to Britain, Europe, and on to the US where he met the founders of Noraid. Kelly was one of the co-defendants in the subsequent Dublin \\"Arms Trial\\" with ministers Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, accused of conspiring to import arms illegally into the Republic of Ireland. The trial eventually collapsed from a lack of evidence, as the relevant government files were kept secret, but the Irish government sacked several ministers as a result. Councillor and MLA 1997–2003 Kelly went into electoral politics, serving on Magherafelt District Council from 1997. He was elected in the 1998 election to the Northern Ireland Assembly as a Sinn Féin member for Mid Ulster.NI Assembly Biography of John Kelly Kelly was deselected before the 2003 election, and criticised the decision by the Sinn Féin leadership to support policing reforms. In January 2006 he co-wrote a letter with Brendan Hughes which cast doubt on the claims that dissident republicans had threatened Sinn Féin leaders and claimed that the real threats were being made by the Sinn Féin leadership against those who sought a debate on policing. He left Sinn Féin which he considered too controlled from the centre, opposing the leadership: \\"deceit and the philosophy of creative ambiguity\\", and retired from politics. Kelly died from cancer on 6 September 2007 after a long illness. Many tributes have been paid to him including a minute's silence before the Derry Senior Football Championship quarter final between An Lúb and Dungiven on 8 September 2007, at the home of his local club, Watty Graham Park, Glen.

It is located from Lalpet and from Chennai, India. It is one of the water reservoirs from where water is supplied to Chennai city. The lake has a capacity to store about 1,465 mcft of water. Though the level in the Veeranam lake has dipped to 323 million cubic feet (mcft), the same amount of 180 mld (million litres a day) was being drawn for city supply. History Veeranam Lake was built in the Tenth Century during the time of Greater Cholas, from 907–955 AD and is a long dam in northern Tamil Nadu. It was created by Rajaditya Chola. He named it after his father Parantaka I Chola, who had the title \\"Veeranarayanan\\". Veeranarayanapuram modified into Veeranam over time. Veeranam lake gets water from Kollidam via Vadavaru River. The lake remains dry for the major part of the year. Water released from the Mettur dam through Kollidam and Lower Anicut would also bring in sufficient inflow into the Veeranam Lake. The lake received sufficient inflow in April enabling supply to the city for three months. With heavy rain in Western Ghats, the lake almost got its storage capacity as it received inflow from the Cauvery tributaries Bhavani and Amaravathi.http://wikimapia.org/488090/Veeraanam-Lake  The Veeranam Project  The Veeranam project, to supply water to Chennai, was conceived in 1967 by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, C. N. Annadurai, and executed under his successor, M. Karunanidhi. The project's completion in 2004 by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, J.Jayalalitha. It was impossible to use any water from the lake since it had run dry, and the face-saving proposal adopted by the authorities was to dig 45 deep borewells around the area and pump the resulting water to Chennai via the pipeline. The length of the lake is 14 km and this is the largest lake in Tamil Nadu. The credit goes to ancient people who have done this job with ordinary hand made tools.  In literature  The opening chapter of the book Ponniyin Selvan is set on the banks of the Veera Narayana Lake. Kalki gives an elaborate description of the features of the lake and the way multiple rivers flow into the lake. Kalki added Chola princess Kundavi used to come for refreshment at the banks of Veeranam lake during spring season. He also makes a reference to the fact, that Ramanujacharya decided on the number of 64 Peetas - 74 simhasanathipathigal based on the number of 74 openings in the lake.

He was captain of the submarine I-58, which sank the American heavy cruiser in 1945 after its delivery of parts and enriched uranium for the first atomic weapon used in wartime, Little Boy, prior to the attack on Hiroshima. Born in Kyoto and educated at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, Hashimoto volunteered for service in submarines and was aboard submarine I-24 during the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Hashimoto commanded coastal patrol and training submarines off Japan for much of the war, and in 1944 took command of I-58, a submarine which was equipped to carry kaiten manned torpedoes. After a number of unsuccessful operations, under the command of Hashimoto I-58 sank Indianapolis on 30 July with two Type 95 torpedoes while on a midnight patrol. He lost his entire family in the Little Boy atomic bombing of Hiroshima days after the sinking of Indianapolis.http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2016/07/uss_indianapolis_survivor_youv.html Hashimoto's submarine then returned to Japan, one of the few Japanese submarines to survive the war. Hashimoto was called to testify on behalf of the prosecution at the court-martial of Charles B. McVay III, the commanding officer of Indianapolis, a move which was controversial at the time. He was later part of an effort to exonerate McVay, which was eventually successful. Hashimoto later became a Shinto priest. He died in 2000. Early life Mochitsura Hashimoto was born in 1909 in Kyoto, Japan the eighth of nine children and fifth son of a kannushi (Shinto priest). He attended Kyoto Third High School, a prestigious school, where he performed well. In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. The family did not have a naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's government subsidy and felt entering his son into the military would help to provide for them. One of Hashimoto's older brothers subsequently attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army. Hashimoto graduated from high school in 1927 and was accepted into the Naval Academy. Leaving home for the first time, Hashimoto then attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima for four years, studying Japanese history, engineering, and naval tactics, as well as judo and other military athletics. He graduated and commissioned in 1931. In 1937, Hashimoto married Nobuko Miki, the daughter of a successful Osaka businessman. The couple had three sons; Mochihiro, born in 1940, Nobutake, born in 1942, and Tomoyuki, born in 1944;and Sonoe, a daughter born in 1947.  Military career  In 1934, Hashimoto volunteered for the submarine service, and in 1937, he served aboard destroyers and submarine chasers off the shores of the Republic of China. On 15 November, as a sub-lieutenant, Hashimoto was assigned to the crew of the gunboat Hozu, and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 December.Naval appointment dated 15 November 1937, supplement to publication No. 91.

On 18 November, I-24 and her group sailed from Kure with a midget submarine attached to her afterdeck. Steaming eastward, she surfaced off Waikiki on 6 December. The sub was a part of a large group of submarines which would support the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Hashimoto witnessed the final ritual of Kazuo Sakamaki and Kyoji Inagaki, who would man the midget submarine, which cast off at 05:30. I-24 remained at a rendezvous point to wait for the midget sub, which never came. On 9 December, I-24 steamed for Kure. Upon the submarine's return to Kure, Hashimoto was detached and assigned to the advanced course at Submarine School on 1 February 1942, to prepare him for command of a submarine.Naval appointment dated 2 February 1942, Publication (limited access) No. 805, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072084200 (jp) Graduating from this course on 30 June, Hashimoto was given command of submarine Ro-31, a coastal defense vessel. For the remainder of 1942, Hashimoto operated his ship in home waters off Yokosuka training crews and trying new equipment and doing research for the development of Japanese submarine doctrine. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 November.Naval appointment dated 1 November 1942, Publication (limited access) No. 974, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072087700 (jp) In 1943, he was given command of submarine I-158 for coastal defense, and later in the year was given command of submarine Ro-44 for the same duties.  Commanding I-58  In May 1944, Lieutenant Commander Hashimoto was given command of submarine I-58 which was still under construction in Sasebo. Hashimoto oversaw much of the construction of I-58. The submarine was later overhauled mid-construction to carry Kaiten manned torpedoes, which was considered a great honor by Hashimoto's crew. I-58 was commissioned on 13 September 1944 and Hashimoto commanded her during her shakedown cruises, commanding his men on repeated drills without shore leave. He completed training on the submarine in December 1944. The ship traversed Shimonoseki Strait into the Inland Sea and to Kure for supplies. She then moved to Hirao where she loaded six kaitens. in 1944 On 29 December, she left on her first war patrol, steaming for the Mariana Islands. She arrived off the coast of Guam at 03:00 on 11 January 1945 and Hashimoto ordered four kaitens launched. The kaitens tentatively claimed a tanker sunk, though it was unable to verify if the ship had actually been struck. The strike had been unsuccessful. She then sped back to Kure and arrived there on 20 January. She remained in port there until March, likely due to supply shortages. On 1 March, she was ordered to Iwo Jima to support the battle taking place there. Once there, I-58 was ordered to launch all of its kaitens without their pilots and immediately return home. She was ordered out again on 2 April sailing to support Japanese forces at the Battle of Okinawa. While there, she was attacked by aircraft 50 times. She never surfaced for more than a few hours. She limped to Kure on 29 April 1945, the only Japanese submarine to withdraw from the operation. She remained in port because of continued mining conducted by U.S. Army Air Forces, and departed on 16 July on another war patrol. At the time, she was one of only four large submarines left in the Japanese Navy, and her mission was to harass Allied lines of communications. Passing through the Inland Sea around minefields, I-58 headed for the east coast of The Philippines intending to attack ships there. Passing east of Okinawa and spotting no ships, she cruised south arriving at the Guam-Leyte shipping lane on 27 July. She spotted a tanker escorted by a destroyer and Hashimoto ordered her to launch two kaitens at 14:31 and 14:43. She heard explosions at 15:21 and 15:31 but her crew was unable to determine if the kaitens had struck their targets. Hashimoto reported a tanker assumed sunk.  Sinking of Indianapolis On 29 July, Lt. Cmdr. Hashimoto ordered the submarine to make for an area where he believed shipping lanes between Guam, Leyte, Peleliu and Okinawa intersected. At 23:35 that evening, Hashimoto spotted the heavy cruiser at cruising for his position at medium speed. Believing the ship to be an \\"Idaho-class\\" battleship, he ordered I-58 to dive and once Indianapolis closed to he ordered six regular torpedoes fired at 00:02 on 30 July. Spotting three explosions strike the Indianapolis, Hashimoto ordered the submarine on a deep dive fearing detection. After an hour at a deep dive to reload, she surfaced and did not spot Indianapolis. After searching unsuccessfully for flotsam or any sign of the ship, he ordered the I-58 to retire at 02:30. He transmitted a short wave radio message to the 6th Fleet headquarters in Kure at about 03:00 noting the destruction of the ship. He later wrote of the incident: Hashimoto ordered I-58 northward looking for additional ships to attack. She picked up reports of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in intercepted radio transmissions on 7 August but Hashimoto continued to hunt for Allied ships south of Bungo Strait. On 9 August she launched two kaitens against a convoy, and Hashimoto claimed a destroyer probably sunk. On 12 August he launched his remaining kaitens and claimed a merchant ship probably sunk. I-58 surfaced in Bungo Strait on 15 August, where Hashimoto learned of the Gyokuon-hōsō signaling the Japanese surrender and end of the war. She traveled up the Inland Sea and arrived at Hirao where Hashimoto emotionally informed his crew of the end of the war. After the war, it was confirmed Indianapolis was the only ship I-58 had sunk. It was the last Japanese naval success of World War II. When Hashimoto came home from the war, he learned that his entire family had been killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 7 August.  McVay court-martial  in 1945 Three days after Japan's formal surrender in Tokyo Bay, Hashimoto was promoted to his final rank of commander.Naval appointment dated 11 September 1945, Publication No. 1908, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072108400 (jp) On 20 November, he was given command of the destroyer Yukikaze, among the few Imperial Navy ships to survive the war, and assigned to repatriation duties, returning troops to Japan from overseas.Naval appointment dated 29 November 1945, Publication No. 1994, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072147800 (jp) Before Hashimoto could begin his new duties, however, he was summoned by the United States military to be a witness for the prosecution in the court-martial against Indianapolis commander Captain Charles B. McVay III, who was on trial on charges of negligence leading to the ship's sinking. On 9 December 1945 he was transported from Tokyo to Oakland, California aboard an aircraft of the Naval Air Transport Service. Hashimoto was assured he would be treated as a naval officer instead of a prisoner of war or war criminal, but he remained under guard during his time in the United States and was not allowed to leave his hotel, as his appearance had been front-page news that day in the New York Times and in other newspapers. The next day he arrived in Washington, D.C. where hearings were taking place. For the duration of his time in the United States, he spoke through translator Francis Earl Eastlake from the Office of Naval Intelligence. Hashimoto spoke first with judge advocate Captain Thomas J. Ryan for four hours on 11 December. He spoke the next day with Captain John P. Cady, McVay's chief defense counsel, for several hours, as both officers sought to determine his credibility and competence to take the stand in the trial. He told them the visibility was good on the night of the attack and he had been able to easily spot the Indianapolis. Hashimoto testified in the court on 13 December in a crowded courtroom. It was the first time that an officer of a nation at war with the United States had testified against an officer of the U.S. Navy in a court martial. At the behest of Cady, Hashimoto took both a Japanese civil oath and a U.S. Navy oath and so he could be charged for perjury in both nations if he lied. Hashimoto's 50 minutes of testimony focused on whether or not Indianapolis was \\"zigzagging\\" and he noted the ship did not deviate from its course. However, he also noted that its position made such evasive maneuvers incapable of diminishing his ability to attack the ship. Still, his testimony is considered integral in McVay's eventual conviction that he had been negligent. Charles Butler McVay III was exonerated in 2001. Following his appearance at the trial, Hashimoto remained in U.S. custody under guard until early 1946, when he was returned to Japan aboard . With the Nuremberg Trials underway and Japanese war crimes during the war coming to light, the announcement of Hashimoto's appearance in testimony against an American officer caused considerable controversy in the American news media. Though Hashimoto was himself known to be innocent of any war crimes and was generally treated well by his guards, he spoke little English and was subject to derision in the press. Among the public responses, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean sent an angry telegram to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal to complain, and U.S. Representative Robert L. Doughton publicly stated, \\"It is the most contemptible thing I ever heard of to summon a Jap officer to testify against one of our own officers. I made my living practicing law before Navy courts and boards for 25 years, and this reaches an all-time low in courts, board or congressional investigation.\\" Columnist Robert Ruark accused the Navy of using Hashimoto to \\"hype up\\" the court martial. Even after his departure his testimony remained controversial, and the Chicago Sun criticized his trip, which it estimated to have cost $1,820 (). Postwar career After his return to Japan, Hashimoto worked as a demobilization officer with the naval section of the Ministry of Demobilization, responsible for demobilizing veterans and dismantling what remained of the Japanese Navy. He completed his final assignment in June 1946, when he became a civilian merchant shipping captain, and opted to retire from the military.Ministry of Demobilization appointment dated 11 June 1946, Publication No. 155, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072159300 (jp) When his ship accidentally collided with and sank a freighter, he was forced to resign.Washington Post 1991/09/29 Afterward, he became a Shinto priest at a shrine in Kyoto. He was later interviewed by author Dan Kurzman for his 1990 book Fatal Voyage, in which Kurzman stated, \\"Commander Hashimoto was amazed by the Americans. While penned up in his dormitory during the trial, he was treated more like an honored guest than an enemy officer who had caused the deaths of so many American boys.\\" Hashimoto later authored a book Sunk: The Story of the Japanese Submarine Fleet, 1941–1945 in which he detailed Japanese submarine operations in the war, including an account of the sinking of Indianapolis. In December 1990, Hashimoto met with some of the survivors of the Indianapolis at Pearl Harbor, where he stated through a translator: \\"I came here to pray with you for your shipmates whose deaths I caused,\\" to which survivor Giles McCoy simply responded: \\"I forgive you.\\" In 1999, he assisted the surviving crew of the Indianapolis in attempting to exonerate McVay of blame for the ship's sinking, writing a letter to the Senate Armed Services Committee in which he stated, just as he had more than five decades earlier, that even if the Indianapolis had been zigzagging, there would have been no difference: \\"I would have been able to launch a successful torpedo attack against his ship whether it had been zigzagging or not.\\" Regarding McVay's conviction, Hashimoto wrote: Hashimoto died at the age of 91 on 25 October 2000, five days before a resolution to posthumously exonerate Captain McVay was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton.

Everiss led Albion to the League Title in the 1919-20 season, and to the FA Cup in 1931. Everiss joined Albion's office staff in 1896. He was appointed secretary-manager in 1902, a post he would hold until 1948. His 46 years in the job technically make him English football's longest-serving manager of all time, although much of his combined role was administrative, and the job of picking the team was left to the directors. Indeed, Albion did not create the full-time post of 'manager' until Everiss left his position. He was made a director upon his retirement in 1948 but died three years later in 1951 at the age of 68. Everiss' son Alan joined the Albion staff in 1933. He was associated with the club for 66 years, serving as clerk, assistant-secretary, secretary, director and life member.

Ports were announced for the Sega CD, Sega 32X, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, and in Japan only for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, but only the Japan-only PlayStation version was released. Gameplay The player assumes the role of Dr. Angelo, sent in to virtual reality to defeat Jobe, who was born with an intellectual disability but increased his brain capacity by 400% using virtual reality, then eventually left his physical body and entered VR permanently. The various gameplay elements are based on the virtual reality segments seen in the original film. For instance, one of the levels has the player flying through tunnels while avoiding multiple objects, much like one of the games in the film. If the player misses any part of any challenge, he reaches a game over. Cyberwar consists of three discs but also includes a CD with the soundtrack featured in the game.

Unfortunately, the old man dies, leaving Mariana at the mercy of his cruel wife Irma, and her lover, Diego. Irma married Don Leonardo for mere economic interest, never loved him, and she was the one who fomented his vice for alcohol, so that he would leave the administration of his properties, and thus be able to manage his fortune. He always made him believe that they were bankrupt, when in truth they were enormously rich. With the death of her husband, and believing herself the owner of everything, Irma expels Mariana from the hacienda, without caring about her fate.

Shortly after her arrival, Mariana is helped by a priest, the well-known Father Adrián. He speaks with a great friend of his, the millionaire Don Alberto Salvatierra to take her to live at home, and get a job as a servant. Don Alberto, knowing of the early arrival of his son, the arrogant and handsome Luis Alberto, comes up with a brilliant idea. Her plan is that Mariana does not work as an employee in her home, but rather as \\"one of her family\\"; which implies that he feels like eating with his family at the same table, and that he says and does what he wants without any restriction. With all this he believes that he can make his son Luis Alberto change his attitude of laziness and irresponsibility, and become the productive, hardworking and successful man he has always wanted to have as a son.

It was produced by Thames Television in 1978 and starred Tom Bell as Frank (\\"Frankie\\") Ross. It was hugely popular at the time of its release with an average audience of 10 million viewers. The series ran 1 season (6 episodes), with Bell declining to make a sequel.  Plot summary  Frank Ross (actor Tom Bell) returns from an eight-year prison sentence for a robbery that was thwarted because somebody 'grassed' the gang. Nobody knows who put the finger on him, but Ross is determined to find out and seeks revenge on those who betrayed him. Whilst inside, his wife has gone into a home and his son is going off the rails. Little by little, Ross pieces together the trail that leads to a dramatic conclusion.  Cast  The gang included John Junkin, Frank Mills, Oscar James and Peter Blake. Other notable actors included Norman Rodway (as Inspector Bryce - the man who put Ross away), Brian Croucher (Frank's only real friend Chris), Andrew Paul as his son Paul Ross with Linda Robson as Paul's girlfriend Mo, Brian Cox (as gangland rival McGrath), Derrick O'Connor and Bryan Marshall (two of McGrath's heavies).  Cultural impact  In the weeks prior to its broadcast on Monday evenings, brief clips of the programme were shown to arouse viewer interest in which a character provided only the cryptic information that 'Frank Ross is OUT'. Also, around the time of the series, a lot of graffiti saying, \\"Frank Ross is innocent\\" appeared around London, an apparent parody of the \\"George Davis is innocent\\" campaign slogans still visible on walls at the time. When a rail strike disrupted many people's plans to make it home in time for the final episode, \\"who grassed Frank Ross?\\" could be seen scrawled across blackboards at Euston station.

The most popular sports in Wales are rugby union and association football. Like the other countries of the United Kingdom, Wales enjoys independent representation in major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup and in the Rugby World Cup, but competes as part of the England cricket team and as Great Britain in some other competitions, including the Olympics. The Millennium Stadium is the largest stadium in Wales. Located in Cardiff, it is the home of the Wales national rugby union team with a capacity of 74,505. It was the temporary location for English football and rugby league finals during the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium. The Cardiff City Stadium is currently the home of the Wales national football team. Sport Wales is responsible for sport in Wales. In 2008/09, Cardiff had the highest percentage (61%) of residents who regularly participated in sport and active recreation out of all 22 local authorities in Wales, whereas Rhondda Cynon Taf had the lowest (24%).Welsh Assembly Government  Local Area Summary Statistics p44 Native Celtic sports The native games that developed in Wales share a Celtic heritage with coeval sports in Cornwall, Scotland and Ireland. A number of sports are recorded, including variations of 'village football', 'bat and ball' and 'hand ball' games. The most prominent native sports to survive into modern Welsh history are Cnapan, Bando and Pêl-Llaw. Cnapan Cnapan (sometimes spelt Knapan or Knappan) is an ancient form of medieval football, vaguely resembling rugby football; played in Wales until 1995, it may have been a forerunner to modern rugby union. The game originated in the western counties of Wales, especially Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire. According to George Owen of Henllys, in his Description of Pembrokeshire (1603), cnapan had been \\"extremely popular in Pembrokeshire since greate antiquitie [sic]\\". Despite the game's discontinuation, the legacy of the game can be seen in some places where it was previously played – an example being the \\"Cnapan Hotel\\" in Newport, Pembrokeshire. Bando Bando is a team sport – related to hockey, hurling, shinty, and bandy – which was first recorded in Wales in the eighteenth century. The game is played on a large level field between teams of up to thirty players each of them equipped with a bando: a curve-ended stick resembling that used in field hockey. Although no formal rules are known, the objective of the game was to strike a ball between two marks which served as goals at either end of the pitch. Popular in Glamorgan in the nineteenth century, the sport all but vanished by the end of the century. Now a minority sport, the game is still played in parts of Wales where it has become an Easter tradition. Pêl-Llaw Welsh handball, more commonly known as Pêl- Llaw, is related to Irish handball, Fives, Basque pelota and later American handball and has been continually attested since the Middle Ages. The sports popularity offered ordinary people opportunities through prize-money, bookkeeping and even player professionalism. Pêl-law has been described as \\"Wales’ first national sport\\". Sports in Wales=Rugby union The Encyclopedia of Wales states that the sport of rugby union is \\"seen by many as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness\\".Davies (2008) p. 782 The professional era has seen major and controversial changes to the traditional structure of club rugby in Wales. Wales now shares a single top-flight rugby structure with Scotland, Ireland, South Africa, and Italy: the Pro14 league. Wales is represented by four regional teams that also take part in the European Rugby Champions Cup and the European Rugby Challenge Cup. The Welsh national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and the Rugby World Cup. The country's sevens national team won the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens, and is one of the 15 \\"core teams\\" in the annual World Rugby Sevens Series. Football The body for football in Wales is the Football Association of Wales. It runs the national teams, the recreational game and the main cup competitions. Dragon Park, the Wales National Football Development Centre, is located in Newport. Football developed in the late 19th century, and currently claims the most participation of any sport in Wales. The most successful teams are Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County, Wrexham and The New Saints. Cardiff City were the most successful in the 20th century, having won the FA Cup in 1927 and spent 15 seasons in the top-flight English First Division. Swansea City have also played in the top flight, playing two consecutive seasons in the early 1980s, and were the first Welsh team to win promotion to the English Premier League in 2011. Newport County have played in the second tier of the English football league system and reached the quarter-finals of the 1981 European Cup Winners' Cup. Wrexham, one of the oldest surviving football teams in Britain, have won the Welsh Cup 23 times and reached the quarter-finals of the 1976 European Cup Winners' Cup. The New Saints have topped the Welsh Premier League a record thirteen times – including the past eight seasons. The Welsh football league system has been headed since 1992 by the Cymru Premier. The second tier below the Cymru Premier is split between the Cymru North and the Cymru South. Below this is numerous regional leagues. The main Cup competitions in Wales are the Welsh Cup and the Welsh League Cup. However, for historical reasons, five Welsh clubs (Swansea City, Cardiff City, Newport County, Wrexham and Merthyr Town) play in the English football league system. Athletics Wales has produced a number of athletes who have made a mark on the world stage, including the 110m hurdler Colin Jackson who is a former world record holder and the winner of numerous Olympic, World and European medals. Marathoner Steve Jones set the world record for the marathon in Chicago in 1984 with a time of 2:08:05. He also won a bronze medal at the Commonwealth games in the 10,000m in 1986. The Isle of Anglesey is a member island of the International Island Games Association and compete as Ynys Môn. In the 2015 Island Games, held on Jersey, the Isle of Anglesey came 13th in the medal table with five gold and three bronze medals, won in sailing and athletics. Basketball Basketball has a long affiliation in Wales with Basketball Wales, the National Governing Body of the sport, becoming members of FIBA in 1952. The federation runs two main leagues, split into Southern and Northern leagues, while the country is represented at international level by the Wales national basketball team. In 1978, Wales co-hosted the inaugural Commonwealth Basketball Championships (Senior Men only) with Scotland and England. Coached by Andy Henderson and Paul Kinninmont, with Ralph Wills as Team Manager, the team played its pool matches at The National Sports Centre, Sophia Gardens. On completion of the first round, the team travelled to Coventry to complete the tournament. In 2012 Basketball Wales was part of the Great Britain men's team that played at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but after no Welsh players were selected for the team they decided to leave the Great Britain team to allow their players greater international exposure. Boxing Wales has a strong connection with the sport of boxing, particularly in the South Wales Valleys, with fighters such as Tommy Farr, Freddie Welsh, Jimmy Wilde, Dai Dower and Johnny Owen all competing at the highest level. Joe Calzaghe, born to a Welsh mother and Italian father and raised in Newbridge, retired in 2009 as an unbeaten world champion. Other former world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli, Gavin Rees, Howard Winstone, Jim Driscoll, Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan. Welsh baseball Welsh baseball () or British baseball, is a bat-and-ball game played in south Wales and formerly in parts of England. It is closely related to the game of rounders, and emerged as a distinct sport when governing bodies in Wales and England agreed to change the name of the game from \\"rounders\\" when the rules were codified in 1892.Davies (2008), p. 53 The sport was at its peak in Wales in the 1930s and 1950s, and is most popular in the cities of Cardiff and Newport. As a traditional bat-and-ball game, its roots go back much further, and literary references to baseball and rounders date back many centuries, the earliest mentions \\"base ball\\" being played in Britain in 1744. Having once been able to attract crowds of 20,000, Welsh Baseball is now an exclusively amateur sport. The international fixture between England and Wales was cancelled in 2015 following the sport's rapid decline in England. Cricket In cricket, England and Wales field a single representative team in international competition which is administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). There is a separate Wales cricket team that occasionally participates in limited-overs domestic competition. A Wales team also plays in the English Minor Counties competition. Cricket is one of the most popular summer sports within Wales.Goal Programme – The Football Association of Wales, Ltd – 2003 FIFA Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. Cycling Cycling has been a popular sport in Wales since the Victorian period. Two of the first stars of British racing both came from Aberaman, Jimmy Michael and Arthur Linton. The Wales National Velodrome is located in Newport and Wales has continued to produce a number of successful international cyclists throughout the modern era including Olympic champions Nicole Cooke and Geraint Thomas. On the 29th of July, 2018 Thomas went on to become the first Welshman to win the Tour de France.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/44998961 Cooke had previously won the women's equivalent, the Grande Boucle Féminine Internationale, in 2006 and 2007. Darts Darts is a popular amateur sport in Wales, widely associated with public houses and working men's clubs. The sport first gained widespread popularity in the 1920s, and 1930s, being a relatively cheap hobby that could be enjoyed with friends socially. During this period pub cup competitions and league teams began to form in the country.Davies (2008), p. 195 During the 1970s, and 1980s, a period in Britain when darts was an extremely popular television sport, Wales provided popular professional players such as Ceri Morgan, Leighton Rees and Alan Evans. Rees won the World Darts Championship in 1978, a feat repeated by Richie Burnett in 1995 and Mark Webster in 2008. Since 1988 Wales hosts its own Open championship. Golf Although a sport most associated with Scotland, golf has a tradition in Wales stretching back to the late 19th century. The first recognised golf courses were constructed in Wales in the 1880s, though a short course was built in Pontnewydd in Cwmbran in 1875.Davies (2008) p. 325 Most of these early courses were built on coastal common land, including Tenby (1880), Borth and Ynyslas (1885). As tourism developed in Wales, the golf clubs helped attract visitors, which was further advertised by the newly constructed passenger rail links. The first amateur golf championship was held at Aberdovey in 1895, and nine years later the first professional championship was at Radyr in Cardiff.Davies (2008) p. 326 In Wales, golf was open to both men and women from its earliest beginnings, with the Welsh Ladies' Golf Union founded in 1904. Despite the openness of the sport to both sexes, it was still considered elitist by many in Wales, and essentially an English pastime. As living standards improved during the 20th century, golf began to lose its elitist label, and was embraced by all sections of society. Dai Rees was one of the first successful Welsh golfers, captaining a winning British and Irish Ryder Cup team in 1957. Wales has won the golfing World Cup on two occasions, with the pairing of David Llewellyn and Ian Woosnam lifting the trophy in Hawaii in 1987, and again in 2005, with Stephen Dodd and Bradley Dredge winning in Portugal. Woosnam then followed countryman Rees' achievement when he led Europe to victory against the USA in the 2006 Ryder Cup. Seven Welshmen have appeared at the European Ryder Cup team: Rees, Woosnam, Bert Hodson, Brian Huggett, Dave Thomas, Phillip Price and Jamie Donaldson. Meanwhile, Becky Brewerton has played at the Solheim Cup. The Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, South Wales was the venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup; the first time the event was held in Wales. Europe beat the USA by 14.5 points to 13.5 in one of the most dramatic finishes to the tournament in recent years. The event also made history by becoming the first Ryder Cup to stretch over four days, following heavy rain throughout the weekend. Horseracing Organised horse racing in Wales originated with the gentry and aristocracy, but by 1833 there were internationally recognised flat races at many locations around the country, including Cowbridge, Brecon and Wrexham.Davies (2008) p. 376 Steeplechasing began at Bangor-Is-Coed in the 1850s, and is still a racecourse to this day. The 20th century saw the Welsh working class embrace the sport, mainly due to the spread of off-course betting. 1926 saw the opening of Chepstow Racecourse which presently holds the Welsh National. Today only three racecourses survive in Wales, Chepstow, Bangor-Is-Coed and Ffos Las which was opened in 2009. Wales has produced several jockeys of note, including Jack Anthony who won the Grand National on three occasions (1911, 1915 and 1920), Hywel Davies who won it in 1985 and Carl Llewellyn who won the race most recently in 1992 and again in 1998. Another notable Welsh jockey was Dick Francis, who was British jump racing Champion Jockey in the 1953–54 season and was famous for riding Devon Loch when the horse slipped close to the winning post when leading 1956 Grand National. In retirement Francis became a best-selling author of crime novels set in the racing world. A popular, if unusual, form of horseracing in Wales is harness racing, known in Wales as 'trotting'. The oldest trotting meet in Wales is the Llangadog which has been held every Easter Monday since 1884.Davies (2008) p. 377 In 1990, 'Tir Prince' an American-style raceway was opened in Towyn which now holds 13 races a year, many of which are shown on Welsh language television channel S4C on its programme Rasus. Lacrosse The sport of lacrosse in Great Britain gained popularity when Queen Victoria championed the sport as suitable for girls in public schools.Davies (2008) p. 441 The sport was embraced in Wales, and an international women's team was representing the country by the 1920s. In the 1930s the Welsh Lacrosse Association was formed, but an attempt to form a men's national team in the 1940s failed to establish. A men's team was successfully founded in 1991, and in the first European Lacrosse Championships the team finished third, their best result. The women's team has been far more successful, and have never been out of the top three in the women's European Lacrosse Championships, winning the competition 1999, 2004 and 2008. They are the current European champions. Motor sports The rugged terrain of the country also gives plenty of opportunities for rally driving and Wales currently hosts the Wales Rally GB, the finale of the World Rally Championship. Wales has had some notability in the World Rally Championship, producing two championship winning Co-Drivers, those being Nicky Grist, who helped Juha Kankkunen to win the 1993 title, as well as winning 17 rallies with Colin McRae, and Phil Mills who helped Petter Solberg win the 2003 title. More recently Elfyn Evans became a full-time WRC driver in 2014, having won the Junior British Rally Championship in 2010 and the WRC Academy Cup in 2012. He scored two podium finishes in the 2015 season, including a best result of second at the Tour de Corse. Two Welsh drivers have competed in the Formula One championship: the first was Alan Rees at the 1967 British Grand Prix, who finished in ninth position, four laps behind the winner, Jim Clark. Rees was subsequently involved in the management side of motorsport for many years, co-founding March Engineering and the Arrows team as well as working for Shadow Racing Cars. Tom Pryce was the more notable of the two drivers, as he finished on the podium twice and, at the 1975 British Grand Prix, qualified in pole position. Pryce's career was cut short at the 1977 South African Grand Prix after he collided with volunteer marshal, Jansen Van Vuuren, killing both instantly. Freddie Williams was world speedway champion in 1950 and 1953, and the British Grand Prix – the United Kingdom's round of the world championship – is held each year at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. For many years Newport Wasps ran a team in the British speedway leagues as did Carmarthen. Wales has also produced several champions in autograss, a form of motor racing on grass or dirt tracks. Rugby league Early attempts made to bring rugby league to Wales in the 20th century, was the formation of the short-lived Welsh League in 1908 which was followed by the second Welsh League which ran from 1949 until 1955. There are currently two professional rugby league clubs in Wales, the North Wales Crusaders (previously known as Celtic Crusaders and Crusaders RL) based in Wrexham who played in the Super League from 2009–11, and Maesteg based South Wales Scorpions. They both compete in Championship 1, the third tier of British Rugby League. The Rugby League Conference Welsh Premier is the top division for rugby league clubs in Wales and the division below is the Rugby League Conference Welsh Championship The national side, nicknamed the Dragons, has often been one of the strongest sides in international rugby league and has also provided a number of players for the Great Britain team. They compete in the European Nations Cup and the World Cup. The national side competed in the 2011 Four Nations, finishing last in the table. The Wales Rugby League achieved governing body status in 2005. Snooker Although little is known of the development of snooker (or billiards) in Wales, in the 20th century it became a popular pastime in working men's clubs. One of the first Welsh stars of the sport was amateur Horace Coles, who was runner up to Allan Prior in the 1927 World Billiard Championships.The 1927 World Amateur Championship Peter Ainsworth Coles reached the final again in 1935, this time victorious over McGhie of Scotland to take the World title.Past Champions International Billiards and Snooker Federation Players of note after the Second World War included Roy Oriel of Mountain Ash and Clive Everton, who is now most recognised as a snooker commentator and journalist. The popularisation of colour television in the 1970s, brought the game of snooker to a new demographic of viewers. The decade was dominated by Ray Reardon from Tredegar, who won six World Snooker Championship titles, and when the first world rankings were introduced in 1976, Reardon became the first world number one snooker player. Some of Reardon's contemporaries included Gary Owen from Tumble and Cliff Wilson also from Tredegar. Wales has continued to produce world class snooker players since Reardon's time, including Terry Griffiths, Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens. Amateur participation in the sport is very high. Other sports Surfers at Llangennith, Gower, South Wales. Photo: RIPNROCK The Cardiff Devils play in the Elite Ice Hockey League, the highest level of ice hockey competition in the United Kingdom. Australian rules football is a growing sport with several clubs starting up in the mid-2000s. Wales has a national team the Wales Australian rules football team, they are the holders of the Dragon Cup after beating England 179–93 on aggregate on 18 and 25 October 2008. Wales also competes as part of the Great Britain Australian rules football team in the Australian Football International Cup, which is essentially a World Cup for all countries apart from Australia which is the only place where the sport is played professionally. The Tiger Bay Brawlers are a roller derby league based in Cardiff, Wales. Founded in April 2010, the league has a two publicly bouting A and B teams, as well as two Intraleague teams, the Merchants of Menace and the Bruise Birds (not yet debuted publicly). The league plays using the Women's Flat Track Derby Association rules set. The South Wales Warriors are a British American Football team based in Llanharan, Mid Glamorgan, Wales. The team was formed in 2001 after the Tiger Bay Warriors had disbanded due to the departure of head coach Rob Mota, along with key staff and players, by the remaining players and staff, using equipment, resources and shirts from the folded Tiger Bay Warriors for economical purposes. Gliding and Paragliding are popular in Wales, South Wales Gliding Club, Black Mountains G.C, North Wales Gliding Club, Denbigh Gliding. Wales is also popular for surfing. Olympic sports Wales has produced many notable Olympic and Paralympic athletes for the Great Britain team. Wales' Paralympic athletes were exceptionally successful throughout the 2000s, winning 27 medals in the 2004 Summer Paralympics (12 gold, six silver, nine bronze) and achieving 14 medals at 2008 Summer Paralympics (ten gold, three silvers, one bronze). Two of the most successful Welsh Paralympians to represent Great Britain were Tanni Grey-Thompson, winner of 11 gold medals over four Paralympics and swimmer Dave Roberts who took 11 gold medals over three Paralympics. Other Olympians of note include, Beijing 2008 Olympic Gold medalist and international champion cyclist Nicole Cooke (Road Race), who also won the 2006 and 2007 Grande Boucle – the women's Tour de France, and Geraint Thomas who won Gold(Team Pursuit) at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. He has also rode the Tour de France in 2007, 2010, 2011, 2013,2014 and 2015. Another cyclist Simon Richardson – double gold medallist at the 2008 Summer Paralympics (1 km and 3 km time trial). Swimmer David Davies was a Silver Medalist (10 km marathon) and Athens 2004 Olympic Bronze Medalist (1500 m freestyle). Cardiff provided training facilities for some visiting teams of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The Millennium Stadium also hosted games in both the men's and women's football events.

On account of the ill-feeling she had towards Donnán and his community, she persuaded a number of bandits to kill him. When these bandits arrived in Eigg, they found them chanting their psalms in the oratory and they could not kill them there. Donnán however said to his community: 'Let us go into the refectory so that these men may be able to kill us there where we do our living according to the demands of the body; since as long as we remain where we have done our all to please God, we cannot die, but where we have served the body, we may pay the price of the body.'

Steph. Byz., Ptol.: Agathyrna, Silius Italicus xiv. 259, Livy; Agathyrnum, Pliny the Elder. was an ancient city on the north coast of Sicily between Tyndaris and Calacte. It was supposed to have derived its name from Agathyrnus (),Diodorus Siculus, Library, § 5.8.1 a son of Aeolus, who is said to have founded the city.Diodorus Siculus v. 8. But though it may be inferred from this story that it was an ancient city, and probably of Spartan origin (as a colony of the very near town of Demenna), we find no mention of it in history until after Sicily became a Roman province. During the Second Punic War it became the headquarters of a band of robbers and freebooters, who extended their ravages over the neighboring country, but were reduced by the consul Laevinus in 210 BCE, who transported 4000 of them to Rhegium.Livy xxvi. 40, xxvii. 12 It very probably was deprived on this occasion of the municipal rights conceded to most of the Sicilian towns, which may account for our finding no notice of it in Cicero, though it is mentioned by Strabo among the few cities still subsisting on the north coast of Sicily, as well as afterwards by Pliny, Ptolemy and the Itineraries.Strabo, vi. p. 266Pliny, iii. 8Ptolemy, iii. 4. § 2Antonine Itinerary p. 92Tabula Peutingeriana Location Scholars favor the placement of Agathyrna near Capo d'OrlandoSee . or Sant'Agata di Militello. However, in the past Agathyrna's situation had been much disputed, on account of the great discrepancy between the ancient authorities just cited. Strabo places it 30 Roman miles from Tyndaris, and the same distance from Alaesa. The Itinerary gives 28 M. P. from Tyndaris and 20 from Calacte: while the Tabula (of which the numbers seem to be more trustworthy for this part of Sicily than those of the Itinerary) gives 29 from Tyndaris, and only 12 from Calacte. If this last measurement be supposed correct it would exactly coincide with the distance from Caronia (Calacte) to a place near the seacoast called Acquedolci below San Fratello and about 3 km west of Sant'Agata di Militello, where Fazello describes ruins of considerable magnitude as extant in his day: but which he, in common with Cluverius, regarded as the remains of Aluntium. The latter city may, however, be placed with much more probability at San Marco d'Alunzio: and the ruins near San Fratello could thus be those of Agathyrna, there being no other city of any magnitude that we know of in this part of Sicily.These ruins are now identified as ancient Apollonia, a relatively minor city. Two objections, however, remained: 1. that the distance from this site to Tyndaris is greater than that given by any of the authorities, being certainly not less than 36 miles: 2. that both Pliny and Ptolemy, from the order of their enumeration, appear to place Agathyrna between Aluntium and Tyndaris, and therefore if the former city be correctly fixed at San Marco d'Alunzio, Agathyrna must be looked for to the east of that town. Fazello accordingly placed it near Capo d'Orlando, but admits that there were scarcely any vestiges visible there, and modern scholars continue to accept the identification.Tommaso Fazello ix. 4, p. 384, 5. p. 391; Cluver.

Biography Earlando was born into a poor family and left a promising school career at age seventeen to support his mother and two brothers. He began work as a machine clerk but within a year was elevated to acting supervisor.Boss, Joe D.. Early B. Immortal. Black Solidarity, 1980–1987. Neil began performing live on Soul Imperial Hi-Fi alongside his young apprentice, Wild Apache (aka Super Cat) (b. William Maragh). Earlando supposedly earned his stage name as a result of his reputation for arriving to shows early, thus gaining the name Early Bird, then finally Early B. Early B was soon approached, while on vacation with Stuart Brown (owner of African Star Sound), by a larger sound system, King Majesty. King Majesty was the only set to play all over the parish of St. Thomas. In the evenings he dragged the young Supercat out of his yard in Kingston to the countryside where they performed on King Majesty for almost a year. The owner of King Majesty was a manager in the sugar cane industry and unfortunately was unable to run the sound system during harvest time. Frustration boiled over for \\"Cat\\" and Early B who both had ambitions to make it \\"big time\\". Their first chance came with Killamanjaro. Killamanjaro began as a humble sound system in the cool hills above Kingston with a resident mike-man known by the stagename of \\"Oh Lord\\". In 1980–81, the principal reason for the rise of Killamanjaro was because Early B and Supercat had become its crowd-pulling regulars. Soon every hopeful deejay wanted to \\"hold the mike\\" on the Killamanjaro sound alongside Early B, who had by now acquired a new nickname – The Doctor. He had endless queues of patients as \\"Jaro\\" came of age and established itself as one of the top sets, ranking amongst the legends of the sound world such as Gemini, Black Scorpio, Lee's Unlimited, Volcano and the mighty King Sturgav. Indeed, such was the demand that Killamanjaro set a record, that still holds today, by performing on fifty-two consecutive nights in Kingston. Over the next two years, Early B was in constant demand as a recording artist scoring hits such as Gaterman Get Fraid, Wheel Wheely (also called One Wheely Wheely), Sunday Dish, and Learn Fe Drive. His next step towards the top was a move to the United States where he continued to be a dancehall favourite. Early B's deejay career brought him to other sound systems as well, including the African Star sound system in Toronto, CanadaReggaepedia Wiki and Crystal Blue Flames Sound in New York City. Early performed throughout the US and England (as well as Jamaica) until he was shot to death inside the Windsor Cricket Club, Dorchester, Massachusetts, on 11 September 1994. While rumours have circulated as to the reasoning behind the murder, his killers have never been found. Early B recorded several albums during the mid-80s, which remain well-circulated in the digital age today. Several tribute compilation albums have recently been released on CD, such as Immortal and A Memorial Tributed Reggae Hits.

Tyndale's Bible is credited with being the first English translation to work directly from Hebrew and Greek texts. Furthermore, it was the first English biblical translation that was mass-produced as a result of new advances in the art of printing. The term Tyndale's Bible is not strictly correct, because Tyndale never published a complete Bible. That task was completed by Miles Coverdale, who supplemented Tyndale's translations with his own to produce the first complete printed Bible in English in 1535. Before his execution, Tyndale had translated the New Testament, the Pentateuch, and the historical books of the Old Testament. Of the Old Testament books, the Pentateuch, Jonah, and a revised version of Genesis were published during Tyndale's lifetime. His other Old Testament works were first used in the creation of the Matthew Bible and also greatly influenced subsequent English translations of the Bible. History The chain of events that led to the creation of Tyndale's New Testament possibly began in 1522, when Tyndale acquired a copy of the German New Testament. Tyndale began a translation into English using a Greek text compiled by Erasmus from several manuscripts older than the Latin Vulgate of Jerome, the only translation authorized by the Roman Catholic Church.British Library online catalog of sacred books. Tyndale made his purpose known to Bishop of London Cuthbert Tunstall but was refused permission to produce this \\"heretical\\" text. Thwarted in England, Tyndale moved to the continent. A partial edition was put into print in 1525 in Cologne. But before the work could be completed, Tyndale was betrayed to the authorities and forced to flee to Worms, where the first complete edition of his New Testament was published in 1526. Two revised versions were later published in 1534 and 1536, both personally revised by Tyndale. After his death in 1536, Tyndale's works were revised and reprinted numerous times and are reflected in more modern versions of the Bible, including, perhaps most famously, the King James Version. Tyndale's translation of the Pentateuch was published at Antwerp by Merten de Keyser in 1530. His English version of the Book of Jonah was published the following year. This was followed by his revised version of the Book of Genesis in 1534. Tyndale translated additional Old Testament books including Joshua, Judges, First and Second Samuel, First and Second Kings and First and Second Chronicles, but they were not published and have not survived in their original forms. When Tyndale was martyred, these works came to be in the possession of one of his associates, John Rogers. These translations were influential in the creation of the Matthew Bible which was published in 1537. Tyndale used numerous sources when carrying out his translations of both the New and Old Testaments. When translating the New Testament, he referred to the third edition (1522) of Erasmus's Greek New Testament, often referred to as the Received Text. Tyndale also used Erasmus's Latin New Testament, as well as Luther's German version and the Vulgate. Scholars believe that Tyndale stayed away from using Wycliffe's Bible as a source because he did not want his English to reflect that which was used prior to the Renaissance. The sources Tyndale used for his translation of the Pentateuch however are not known for sure. Scholars believe that Tyndale used either the Hebrew Pentateuch or the Polyglot Bible and may have referred to the Septuagint. It is suspected that his other Old Testament works were translated directly from a copy of the Hebrew Bible. He also made use of Greek and Hebrew grammars. Reaction of the Catholic Church and execution The Tyndale Bible on display at the Bodleian Library, Oxford Tyndale's translations were condemned in England, where his work was banned and copies burned. Catholic officials, prominently Thomas More, charged that he had purposely mistranslated the ancient texts in order to promote anti-clericalism and heretical views. In particular they cited the terms \\"church\\", \\"priest\\", \\"do penance\\" and \\"charity\\", which became in the Tyndale translation \\"congregation\\", \\"senior\\" (changed to \\"elder\\" in the revised edition of 1534), \\"repent\\" and \\"love\\", challenging key doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Betrayed to church officials in 1536, he was defrocked in an elaborate public ceremony and turned over to the civil authorities to be strangled to death and burned at the stake. His last words are said to have been, \\"Lord! Open the King of England's eyes.\\" Challenges to Catholic doctrine Tyndale's translation of the Bible had notes critical of the Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic Church had long proclaimed that the only true Church was the Catholic Church. The word church in Catholic teaching can only be used of the Catholic Church, and there was no other organized religion in England at that time. Some radical reformers preached that the true church was the \\"invisible\\" church, that the church is wherever true Christians meet together to preach the word of God. To these reformers, the Catholic Church was unnecessary, and its very existence proved that it was in fact not the \\"true\\" Church. When Tyndale determined that the Greek word (') was more accurately translated congregation, he was thereby undermining the entire structure of the Catholic Church. Many of the reform movements believed in the authority of scripture alone. To them it dictated how a \\"true\\" church should be organized and administered. By changing the translation from church to congregation Tyndale was providing ammunition for the beliefs of the reformers. Their belief that the church was not a visible systematized institution but a body defined by believers, however organized, who held a specifically Protestant understanding of the Gospel and salvation was now to be found directly in Tyndale's translation of Scripture. Tyndale's use of the word congregation conflicted with the Catholic Church's doctrine that the lay members and the clergy were two separate classes within the Church, and the Catholic teaching of the Sacrament of Ordination. If the true church is defined as a congregation, the common believers, then the Catholic Church's claim that the clergy were of a consecrated order different than the average Christian and that they had different functions within the Church no longer held sway. Tyndale's translation of the Greek word (') to mean elder instead of priest also challenged the doctrines of the Catholic Church. In particular, it undermined the Catholic Mass and its nature as a sacrifice. The role of the priest in the Catholic Church was to offer the sacrifice of Christ's body and blood in the ritual of the Mass, to bless, to conduct other religious ceremonies, to read and explain the scripture to the people, and to administer the other sacraments. In these ways they are different from the common believers. In many reform movements a group of elders would lead the church and take the place of the Catholic priests. These elders were not a separate class from the common believers; in fact, they were usually selected from amongst them. Many reformers believed in the idea of the priesthood of all believers, which meant that every Christian was in fact a priest and had, for example, the right to read and interpret scripture. Tyndale's translation challenged the claim of scriptural basis for Catholic clerical authority. Catholic doctrine was also challenged by Tyndale's translation of the Greek () as repent instead of do penance. This translation conflicted with the Catholic Sacrament of Confession. Tyndale's translation of scripture backed up the views of reformers like Luther who had taken issue with the Catholic practice of sacramental penance. Tyndale believed that it was through faith alone that a person was saved. Christ had, by the giving of the Holy Spirit, given the power to forgive sins to his disciples in John 20:20-23. Tyndale's position on Christian salvation differed from the views of the Catholic Church, which followed the belief that salvation was granted to those who lived according to Catholic doctrine and thus participated in the Church's seven Sacraments. Tyndale's translation challenged the belief that a person had to do penance for his or her sins to be forgiven by God. According to Tyndale's New Testament translation and other Protestant reformers, a believer could repent with a sincere heart, and God would forgive. Tyndale's translation of the Bible challenged the Catholic Church in many other ways. For example, Tyndale's translation of the Bible into a vernacular language made it available to the common English-speaking person. Tyndale wanted everyone to have access to scripture and gave the common people the ability to read it for themselves but with a decidedly Protestant orientation in the choice of words used and in its annotations, which were suffused with Tyndale's Protestant beliefs. The greatest challenge that Tyndale's Bible caused the Catholic Church is best summed up by Tyndale, when he gave one of his primary reasons for translating the Bible: to \\"cause a boy that driveth the plough to know more scripture than the clergy of the day\\", many of whom were poorly educated. By this, Tyndale sought to undermine the Catholic Church's grip on both the access to and interpretation of scripture. To Tyndale, a Roman Catholic priesthood was not needed as an intermediary between a person and God. Legacy Tyndale's Bible laid the foundations for many of the English Bibles which followed his. His work made up a significant portion of the Great Bible which was the first authorized version of the English Bible. The Tyndale Bible also played a key role in spreading Reformation ideas to England which had been reluctant to embrace the movement. By including many of Martin Luther's commentaries in his works, Tyndale also allowed the people of England direct access to the words and ideas of Luther, whose works had been banned in England. Perhaps the Tyndale Bible's greatest impact is that it heavily influenced and contributed to the creation of the King James Version, which is one of the most popular and widely used Bibles in the world today. It has been suggested that around 90% of the King James Version (or at least of the parts translated by Tyndale) is from Tyndale's works, with as much as one third of the text being word for word Tyndale. Many of the popular phrases and Bible verses that people quote today are in the language of Tyndale. An example of this is Matthew 5:9, \\"Blessed are the peacemakers.\\" The importance of the Tyndale Bible in shaping and influencing the English language has been mentioned. According to one writer, Tyndale is \\"the man who more than Shakespeare even or Bunyan has moulded and enriched our language.\\" Tyndale used ester for paskha () in his New Testament, where Wycliffe had used pask. When Tyndale embarked on his Old Testament translation, he realised that the anachronism of ester could not be sustained; and so coined the neologism, passover; which later Bible versions adopted, and substituted for ester in the New Testament as well. Its remnant is seen as Easter once in the King James Version in Acts 12:4 and twice in the Bishops' Bible, John 11:55 as well as Acts 12:4.

His full synagogal name was Moses Eliezer Lipmann ben Kalonymus -- in German, \\"Kallmann,\\" whence the family name \\"Calmer\\" is said to have been derived. From \\"Lipmann\\" undoubtedly came \\"Liefmann.\\" Calmer first moved to The Hague, and later left Holland for France, where he made a fortune in commerce and became official purveyor to King Louis XV. In 1769 he obtained French letters of naturalization. He exerted considerable influence in public affairs and became administrator of the \\"German\\" Jews in Paris. On April 27, 1774, Pierre Briet, lord of Benapré, as front man for Calmer, bought from the creditors of the duke of Chaulnes the lordship of the barony of Picquigny and the function of vidame of Amiens in the Somme for 1,500,000 francs. A little later it was declared that the purchase was made in the name of Liefmann Calmer, full citizen of The Hague and naturalized Frenchman. Because he was not a nobleman, he cannot use the title of baron of Picquigny but only the title of lord of the barony of Picquigny. Only the king of France can created a baron, the fact to buy a barony does not transform the owner into a baron. He thus vidame of Amiens, and the first French Jewish man with ecclesiastic feudal functions. The titles included feudal privileges, among which was the appointment of priests. This led to the fierce opposition of the Catholic Church to the sale. He was first a merchant, so he sold quickly those lordship with profits. Calmer had three sons, two of whom were guillotined during the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution. The third died without issue in 1824.

Early years Van Dyke grew up in Buckner, Missouri, and attended Fort Osage High School in Independence, Missouri. He played college football at the University of Missouri, where he was a two way starter, playing on both the offensive and defensive lines under head coach Dan Devine. As a first-team All-Big Eight Conference defensive tackle in 1965, Van Dyke played on Tigers teams that went a combined 21–8–2 from 1963 to 1965. The 1965 Missouri squad, on which he served as a captain, finished the year ranked sixth nationally, with a win over the Florida in the 1966 Sugar Bowl. Van Dyke was selected to play in the Hula Bowl in 1966, and was inducted into the University of Missouri's Intercollegiate Hall of Fame in 2001. Professional career Van Dyke was selected in the 12th round of the 1966 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles and in the 15th round of the 1966 AFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. He signed with the Eagles and played there his rookie year. The following season he was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers where he played right guard for the next seven seasons. His first year with the Steelers the team had won only one game. In 1972 Pittsburgh finished the season with an 11–3 record and won the AFC Central title. In week 8 of the 1972 Steelers season Van Dyke was named A.P. Offensive player of the week after a 40–17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. That same year the Steelers made their first playoff appearance since the 1947 season and won their first franchise playoff game beating the Oakland Raiders 13–7. During that game, one of the most memorable plays in both Van Dyke's career and NFL history occurred. Trailing 7–6 with 22 seconds left in the game, Franco Harris scored the winning touchdown on the final play of the game. This play, of course, is known as the Immaculate Reception. In 1974, Van Dyke was traded to the Green Bay Packers, where he was reunited with his former college coach Dan Devine. While in Green Bay, he switched to left guard and retired from football after the 1976 season. In 2008, Van Dyke was named to the Pittsburgh Steelers Legends team.

Yves Nat (29 December 1890 – 31 August 1956) was a French pianist and composer. Biography Yves Nat was born in Béziers and showed an early aptitude for both piano and composition. By the age of seven he was allowed to improvise each Sunday at the organ of Béziers' cathedral during mass. At the age of ten he conducted his own Fantasie for orchestra. Both Gabriel Fauré and Camille Saint-Saëns encouraged him to pursue his studies at the Conservatoire de Paris in the master class of the pianist Louis Diémer, receiving the class first prize in 1907. He dedicated himself to chamber music, undertook concert tours with the violinist Jacques Thibaud and George Enescu and appeared frequently in a duo with Eugène Ysaÿe. In 1911 he made the first of a number of tours of the United States. He was mobilised in the course of the First World War, around which time he produced the first of his published compositions, the Six Préludes pour Piano and the Six chansons à Païney. In the years which followed, Nat toured and performed extensivelyJean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, Neva Editions, 2015, \\"Solo nec plus ultra\\", p. 52.. However, he retired from concert life in 1937 to devote himself to teaching in the Paris Conservatoire and composing. He emerged from this retirement in 1953 to play a small number of highly successful concerts. The last of these, on 4 February 1954 was the première of his own Piano Concerto, with the Orchestre National de la Radio-diffusion Française under the conductorship of Pierre Dervaux, at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris. His most notable pupils include Fabienne Jacquinot, Jacqueline Eymar, Reine Gianoli, Santos Ojeda, Jean Martin, Jörg Demus, Frederic Gevers,Frédéric Gevers on Bach Cantatas website Geneviève Joy, Lucette Descaves, Jean-Bernard Pommier, Pierre Sancan and Jean-Marie Beaudet. Repertoire and reputation His repertoire particularly covered the works of Schubert, Schumann and Brahms. Between 1951 and 1955, he recorded all 32 of the Beethoven piano sonatas. For a French pianist of his age, this recorded repertoire was unusual. Most French pianists who developed artistically in the years during and after the First World War tended to champion French composers and to avoid the staple German repertoire. No recordings survive of Nat's extensive French repertoire. Nat's strong technique and rich sonority suited the larger-scale Beethoven sonatas admirably. However, he was far from a bravura pianist - indeed, although his concerto has some formidable technical difficulties, it avoids the classic virtuoso approach, and instead tries to be what Nat himself described in a radio interview as a concerto for piano within the orchestra. He summed up his approach as Tout pour la musique; rien pour le piano, which might be translated as \\"Everything for the music, nothing for the piano\\". His compositions reveal a composer who has a talent for framing simple melodic lines in imaginative harmonies, best illustrated by the slow movement of his piano concerto. His orchestral style is reminiscent of the style of Ravel, with a notable fondness for percussion instruments. Beside the concerto and solo piano works, he composed chamber music and an oratorio.

The film stars Michael Crawford and Oliver Reed as brothers who hatch a plot to steal the Crown Jewels. Very much of its time – \\"Swinging London\\" – the film makes great use of London locations. Included was a short sequence of Jezebel, a 1916 Dennis N-Type fire engine that is still owned and run by the Royal College of Science Union at Imperial College London. Plot Michael Tremayne is booted out of Sandhurst. He and his brother David want to do something \\"big\\". They decide to do a crime as a \\"grand gesture\\". The brothers take Inge, David's new inamorata, on a tour of London, including the Tower of London. At a dinner party they learn that you cannot be charged with theft unless you intend to permanently deprive the owner of their property. David proposes stealing the crown jewels and sending letters out beforehand, showing they aren't intending to permanently deprive. Michael is somewhat jealous of David, as David is considered the ‘good’ son and him the ‘bad’ son. They write and deliver the letters. They plant a bomb at the Albert Memorial and observe the police procedure. Next they put a bomb at the lion cage at the London zoo. Then they blow up a ladies lavatory. David gets a laser. They put a bomb at the stock exchange and David goes to the army base, and using a tape recorder records the procedures. Finally the day comes. Michael goes to the jewel room in the Tower and hides a bomb there. David and Michael go to the base and tie up the duty officer. They take the place of the bomb disposal expert and his assistant. They ride with the army to the Tower. The pair go into the bomb room and knock out the rather silly Colonel who went in with them and who commands the army base. David and Michael have had the alarms turned off, due to the danger of \\"vibration\\", and use the laser to cut into the cabinets and steal the Crown Jewels. The pair set off a small bomb and a smoke bomb. They stagger out pretending to be hurt, then escape from the ambulance taking them to hospital along with the jewels. A worldwide search is undertaken for the robbers. David and Michael enjoy the media frenzy. One week after the robbery on 23 June 1967, the letters are opened and delivered to the police. When they go to get the jewels from their hiding place they are not there. The police arrive to arrest David. Michael says he doesn't know anything about the robbery. Michael never delivered his letter. David is identified as the bomb expert, but the witnesses can't identify Michael. The police investigate, but can't break down Michael's alibi of being at a party. Michael is released. David is indicted and bail is refused. The police set up a plan to make Michael think his alibi is breaking down, but Michael evades police surveillance. We then see him digging up the jewels from where he buried them at Stonehenge. Michael calls on a telephone he knows is tapped to say he's returning the jewels at Trafalgar Square at 4 a.m. The police set up a cordon, but Michael uses their concentration on the square to put the jewels in the scales of justice on top of the Old Bailey. We close with both brothers imprisoned in the Tower, plotting their escape.

The user of such a strategy decides before playing how much money they want to win, and writes down a list of positive numbers that sum to the predetermined amount. With each bet, the player stakes an amount equal to the sum of the first and last numbers on the list. If only one number remains, that number is the amount of the stake. If the bet is successful, the two amounts are removed from the list. If the bet is unsuccessful, the amount lost is appended to the end of the list. This process continues until either the list is completely crossed out, at which point the desired amount of money has been won, or until the player runs out of money to wager. Description of the gameplay The theory behind this Labouchère system is that, because the player is crossing two numbers off of the list (win) for every number added (loss) the player can complete the list, (crossing out all numbers) thereby winning the desired amount even though the player does not need to win as much as expected for this to occur. It should be mentioned that the Labouchère System is meant to be applied to even money Roulette propositions such as Even/Odd, Red/Black or 1–18/19–36. When any of these bets are made in the game of Roulette, a spin resulting in a \\"0\\" or \\"00\\" results in a loss, so even though the payout is even money, the odds are clearly not 50/50. The Labouchère System attempts to offset these odds. If a player were to play any one of the above propositions, there are eighteen individual results which result in a win for that player and (for an American Roulette wheel) twenty individual results that result in a loss for that player. The player has an 18/38 chance of success betting any of the above propositions, which is around 47.37%. Theoretically, because the player is cancelling out two numbers on the list for every win and adding only one number for every loss, the player needs to have his proposition come at least 33.34% to eventually complete the list. For example, if the list starts with seven numbers and the player wins five times and loses three (62.5% winning percentage) the list is completed and the player wins the desired amount, if the list starts with seven numbers and the player wins 43,600 times and loses 87,193 times (33.34% winning percentage) the list completes and the player wins. A formula to understand this is as follows: Where x = Number of wins y = Number of losses z = Numbers originally on the list When (y + z) / 2 ≤ x The result is the list being completed. Assuming a player bets nothing but black (red/black proposition) and black can be expected to hit 47.37% of the time, but the system only requires that it hit 33.34% of the time, it can be said that black only need hit approximately 70.38% of the time (33.34/47.37) it can generally be expected to in order for the system to prevail. An obvious downfall to the system is bankroll, because the more losses sustained by the player, the greater the amount being bet on each turn (as well as the greater the amount lost overall) is. Consider the following list: 10 10 20 20 20 10 10 If a player were to bet black and lose four times in a row, the amounts bet would be: $20, $30, $40, and $50. By taking these four consecutive losses, the player has already lost $140 and is betting $60 more on the next bet. Consecutive losses, or an inordinate number of losses to wins can also cause table limits to come into play. Occasionally, a player following this system will come to a point where he can no longer make the next bet as demanded by the system due to table limits. One work-around for this problem is simply to move to a higher limit table, or a player can take the next number that should be bet, divide it by two and simply add it to the list twice. The problem with the latter option is that every time a player commits such a play, it will infinitesimally increase the percentage of spins a player must win to complete the system. The reason this is so is because the player is adding two numbers (which both will be crossed out in the event of wins) where only one loss was sustained. To prove this, if a player were to play the Labouchère system the same way with the exception being that the player always added half of the wager lost to the bottom of the list twice for every wager lost where: x = Number of wins y = Number of losses z = Numbers originally on the list When: y + (z / 2) ≤ x The result is the list being completed. The player would actually have to win in excess of 50% of the time (the actual percentage of wins necessary, given and , being dependent on ) in order to complete the list, or more than the player could actually be expected to win. Algorithm The algorithm for the Labouchère system can be considered a Las Vegas algorithm since the amount of money a player desires to win will always be a predetermined amount. However, there is no guarantee that the player will reach the desired goal before the bankroll is lost. This is referred to as risk of ruin. For instance, consider the recursive implementation of a round of Labouchère betting in Python. def gamble(sequence, balance): Labouchère betting. # Won if len(sequence) < 1: return balance # If the sequence is of length 1, the bet is the number in the sequence. # Otherwise, it is the first number added to the last number. if len(sequence)  1: bet = sequence[0] else: bet = sequence[0] + sequence[-1] # Lost the entire round if bet > balance: return balance won = flip_coin() if won: # Won return gamble(sequence[1:-1], balance + bet) else: # Lost bet return gamble(sequence + [bet], balance - bet) The recursion of the algorithm terminates when the sequence is empty or when the player possesses insufficient funds to continue betting. When the function is called, the size of the bet made is equal to the sum of the first and last numbers of the sequence. If the length of the sequence is one, then the bet is equal to the sole member of the sequence. If the bet is won, then the first and last members are spliced from the sequence and the next round begins. However, if the bet results in a loss, then an integer equal the size of the lost bet is appended to the sequence and the next round begins. As determined by the parameters for termination of recursion, the only cases in which the algorithm will terminate are those in which the player has either won an amount equal to the summation of the original sequence or has lost all of their available capital. Reverse Labouchère The Labouchère system can also be played as a positive progression betting system; this is known as playing the reverse Labouchère. In this version after a win, instead of deleting numbers from the line, the player adds the previous bet amount to the end of the line. You continue building up your Labouchère line until you hit the table maximum. After a loss, the player deletes the outside numbers and continues working on the shorter line. The player starts their line again if they run out of numbers to bet. The Reverse Labouchère system is often used because where the Labouchère list represents how much the player wants to win, a reverse Labouchère line represents the most that the player will lose during the betting cycle. It is with this that a player with a bankroll of can create their own line, or lines, representative of the maximum amount that they can sustain in losses. Additionally, a player does not necessarily have to continue the system until the table limit is met or exceeded, but could instead pick a single bet that the player does not wish to exceed and make that bet their own personal limit. Unlike the Labouchère system which (when adhered to strictly) requires a winning percentage of at least 33.34% to complete, the winning percentage needed to complete a Reverse Labouchère line is going to be dependent on both the table limit (or the maximum single bet a player is willing to make) as well as the numbers on the initial line in relation to the table limit. For example, if a table had a limit of $500 and a player composed a Reverse Labouchère line as follows: 50, 50, 50, 50, 50 Nine consecutive wins (100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500) would cause the next bet in the system to exceed the table limit, and thus the line would be completed with a player profit of $2,700. In contrast, if a player composed a Reverse Labouchère line such as: 25, 25, 25, 25, 25 Nineteen consecutive wins (50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, 475, 500) would cause the next bet in the system to exceed the table limit, thus the line would be completed with a player profit of $5,225. The length of the line in the Reverse Labouchère system is also important as it relates to the percentage of wins necessary to complete the system. For example, if a line of: 50, 50, 50, 50, 50 suffers three consecutive losses as soon as the system begins, then the line is completed and a new line must be started, or the player may choose to quit. In contrast, if a line of: 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50 suffers three consecutive losses, then there are still six numbers remaining on the list. In the line immediately above, it would take an opening streak of six consecutive losses for the line to be completed. All other things remaining the same, the longer a player's line, the more the player is risking losing. However, the longer the player's line, the better winning percentage the casino need have in order to break the player's line. Advocates of this system point out that when a player uses the Labouchère System, where a streak in the casino's favor, or many mini-streaks in the casino's favor, will cause the player to sustain a huge loss, a single streak, or a few streaks in the player's favor using the Reverse Labouchère system will cause the player to have a huge gain. A formula that can be used to determine how this system could fail is as follows: Where: x = Number of wins y = Number of losses z = Numbers on original list When: x + z ≤ y * 2 The system has failed, and all numbers on the line are crossed completely out. Given an infinite line, the Labouchère System when played by the player requires a winning percentage of at least 33.34% to complete. In contrast, for the Reverse Labouchère to fail requires only that the player lose 33.34% of the time. Once again, the winning percentage necessary for the system completing to success depends upon a number of variables.

It is next to the former Great Central Main Line in the borough of Rushcliffe. History The School began in September 2002 and has been using the old Wilford Meadows building until the arrival of its completed 'new build' in late 2008. The first 6th- form students began their A-Levels in September 2007. In 2000 a project group was established to plan a programme of consultation, including a range of feasibility studies. There was very strong support from parents for the development of another Church school and this proposal was also supported nationally through the recommendations made in the Dearing Report for new Church Aided Schools to be established. In 2001 a temporary Governing body was convened to set up the School. The Nottingham Emmanuel School was so named because it reflects faith in God. The Governors realised that a specifically Christian spiritual ethos in which other faith traditions were hosted within an Anglican framework was crucial to the overall purpose. This is reflected in the School's Admission Policy. The School celebrated its official opening in 2002 with 180 students and is now full in Years 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. In September 2006 the school welcomed their fifth year of intake and this meant students for the first time were entered for public examinations at Key Stage 4. The school has a planned full size of 1150 students, including the Sixth Form in 2008/9. The school converted to academy status on 1 June 2013. Previous schools The true origins of the school, in a convoluted and chequered history, start with the Mundella Grammar School, on Colygate Road in the Meadows, which opened in 1899. The school's name came from Anthony John Mundella, a Liberal MP for Sheffield, and Sheffield Brightside. During the war, from September 1939-March 1940, the school was evacuated to Stamford, Lincolnshire. This became a comprehensive in the 1970s, keeping its former name. These school building s were demolished in 1985. The school transferred to the Roland Green Comprehensive School, which became the Wilford Meadows School. Due to its low results, this school was closed, and has now re-opened as the Nottingham Emmanuel School. Academic performance The school gets average results for Nottingham, but well under the England average, at GCSE. Nottingham LEA gets the lowest results in the East Midlands. The uniform is a white shirt, black blazer with the new 'NES' logo, and a purple tie which has two stripes to representative of the students' houses. Pastoral care=Form tutors Each Tutor Group of mixed ability students is attached to a Year Group and a House. The Tutor Group of approximately 30 students has its own Form Tutor who is supported by two Assistant Tutors from Year 10. The Form Tutor is responsible for supporting the students in their care in all aspects of their school life – academic, social and personal. They will be closely monitoring their academic progress in the National Curriculum through teacher assessment data and their rewards and behaviour record through the online school’s information management system. Advice and guidance can be given over any matter which might affect the individual’s work and personal development. The Form Tutor is the first point of contact for parents and students over any matter relating to school life and normally stays with their tutor group from Year 7 – 11 to ensure continuity of pastoral care and support throughout their school career. Achievement and pastoral managers All of the Tutor Groups and Form Tutors are managed by the Achievement and Pastoral Manager. This person is responsible for co-ordinating the work of the Year group and monitoring overall academic progress. They co-ordinate intervention programmes and ensure that the whole year group work together effectively and maintain high standards of behaviour. The Achievement and Pastoral Manager is available to support parents and tutors in more serious matters of concern relating to any aspect of school life or when initial attempts to resolve issues with the tutor or subject teacher have not been successful. Heads of house The Nottingham Emmanuel School has a house system the houses are represented by colours: Red, Blue, Yellow and Green. This changed in Sept 2017 to King Jnr (green), Romero (red), Pullinger (Yellow) and Booth (Blue) following a vote by students and staff of the respective houses. Special educational needs The SENCo is responsible for the leadership and management of Special Educational Needs provision across the School. Specialist support for students is identified in collaboration with staff and parents and where appropriate, outlined in a student tracking document which details the SEN profile of the student and tracks academic progress against agreed targets. This enables students and staff to work collectively on specific targets that can be monitored on a regular basis. Senior leadership * Mr. D. Hobbs: Principal * Mrs. J. Green: Vice Principal * Mr. A.

She was thought to also be involved in criminal activities. Sue weighed 350 lbs and a contemporary journalist likened her to a big black turtle standing on its hind legs, from which she gained her turtle nickname. Dive Bar Sue's dive bar and brothel was the first in New York to offer 24 hour brothel services. Although thievery among many of the city's taverns and saloons was rampant, Sue was considered to be honest, although the women who worked for her were not on occasions. On one occasion she is reputed to have wandered the streets at 1 am to try and get change for a customer who had given her a $100 note. Failing to obtain the change, she delivered the money and customer to a policeman, fearing that the customer was so intoxicated he might lose the money or get robbed. New York Draft Riots During the New York Draft Riots in 1863, Sue's dive was attacked by women from the Five Points. The women working there fled, but Sue, too large to run, was attacked and \\"frightfully beaten\\" by a group of Irishwomen. Other sources claim she was one of five black women lynched and hung from lampposts. The bar was looted and its liquor was confiscated and distributed amongst the rioters before the building was destroyed.

After high school, Veris went on to Stanford University where he had an outstanding performance which culminated in his induction into the Stanford University Athletics Hall of Fame. Veris was on the Stanford football team during the 1982 game against Cal where Cal won the game on a final play known as The Play. He was taken in the second round of the 1985 NFL draft by the New England Patriots. During his rookie season, he recorded 14 sacks—including four in the playoffs—and started in Super Bowl XX, where his team lost to the Chicago Bears. He finished his career in 1992 with the San Francisco 49ers and later was named to the Patriots' All-1980s team.

He is the frontman of the band Scritti Politti. Early life Gartside was born in Cardiff, Wales, to a \\"Cup-a-soup salesman dad and a hairdresser/secretary/whatever mum\\". His childhood was not always happy, with the family (which included a sister) having to move every 12 months or so because of his father's job. He ended up \\"living all over [Wales], from Bridgend to Newport to Ystrad Mynach\\". His father died while he was a child, after which his widowed mother married her boss, a solicitor from Newport named Gordon Gartside, from whom he adopted his new surname. Gartside recalls, \\"The 'Green' bit came about because I didn’t like the fact there were two other Pauls in my class and I wanted something different. So I just chose something random after listening to a Captain Beefheart album where all the musicians were named odd things like Zoot Horn Rollo. I thought having a made- up name was well cool\\". Gartside attended Croesyceiliog Grammar School in Cwmbran (now known as Croesyceiliog School). At 14 he formed a branch of the Young Communist League. He later completed a foundation course in art at Newport Art College (now known as the Faculty of Creative Industries at the University of South Wales) and formed a band called Heads of the Valleys. In the mid-1970s, Gartside moved to England to study fine art at Leeds Polytechnic. Career While at art school in Leeds in 1977, Gartside formed the post-punk band Scritti Politti with schoolmate and friend Nial Jinks and art school friend Tom Morley. After Gartside and Morley had left Leeds Polytechnic, they moved to London, later securing a recording deal with Rough Trade Records who released the first Scritti Politti album Songs to Remember in 1982. However, subsequent Scritti Politti albums featured Gartside with different personnel, with Gartside being the only constant member of the group. Scritti Politti in 2006 As Scritti Politti, Gartside and New York keyboardist David Gamson and American drummer Fred Maher released the album Cupid & Psyche '85 in June 1985. The album included hits \\"Wood Beez (Pray Like Aretha Franklin)\\" (to the video for which Michael Clark (dancer) lent his contemporary dance); \\"Absolute\\" (the video being based on Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream); \\"The Word Girl\\"; \\"Perfect Way\\"; and \\"Hypnotize\\". Released on Virgin Records it reached number 5 in the UK and was certified Gold by the BPI for 100,000 copies sold. It was produced by Scritti Politti and Turkish-born Arif Mardin who coincidentally also produced Aretha Franklin, one of Gartside's musical influences. In 1988 Scritti Politti's album Provision was a UK Top 10 success, though it only produced one UK Top 20 hit single, \\"Oh Patti\\". After releasing a couple of non-album singles in 1991, as well as a collaboration with B.E.F., Gartside became disillusioned with the music industry and retired to south Wales for more than seven years. Gartside suffered a complete mental breakdown: > We’d been doing months of chat show-type things all around the world and I’d > really started hating myself deeply, and everybody around me, for talking so > much b*******. Unless you’re some sort of weird egomaniac it's not healthy > to spend that amount of time talking about yourself, and I’d become totally > burned out and insane. So to go straight from that into making our next > record was a mistake ... I just remember hailing a cab one day and coming to > in bed surrounded by doctors. In the early and mid 1990s, Gartside lived alone in a secluded cottage in Usk, Monmouthshire, spending his time listening to hip hop, playing darts and drinking beer at his local pub. He returned to music-making in the late 1990s, releasing a new album, Anomie & Bonhomie, in 1999 (which included various rap and hip hop influences). In 2006, another new album was released by Gartside, the stripped-down White Bread, Black Beer by Scritti Politti, which returned to the more experimental era of the band's history. He also returned to touring, including his first ever tour of the United States with his band Scritti Politti.Scritti Politti's First Ever U.S. Tour Dates by B.V. Staff, BrooklynVegan.com, 27 September 2006. In 2012, Gartside, who has suffered from recurring stage fright that prevented Scritti Politti from touring for many years, performed several songs by Sandy Denny as part of a tribute called The Lady in several UK cities. In 2015, Gartside was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from Goldsmiths, University of London. He has been a regular stand- in presenter on BBC 6 Music. Gartside has also worked with Miles Davis, Chaka Khan, Eurythmics, Elvis Costello, Shabba Ranks, Mos Def, Meshell Ndegeocello, Kylie Minogue, Robyn Hitchcock, Manic Street Preachers, Tracey Thorn, and Robert Wyatt (on Songs To Remember).

Her mother, an inspector of girl's schools, died in 1854, and the family's genteel poverty forced Isabelle to seek employment. She found this in Poland, working as a governess with a Polish noble family. It was at this time that she became an autodidact, teaching herself Ancient Greek, Latin, and philosophy. She returned to Brussels in 1861, and continued her education by following public courses organised by the city government. Her ideas on education had already been formed, and in 1862 she launched the journal L'Education de la Femme (Women's Education) which championed the cause of schooling for girls. In 1864, with the financial assistance of the city council, she launched the first systematic courses of secondary female education (Cours d'Éducation pour jeunes filles). Exceptionally for Belgium of the time, this venture was entirely independent of the Roman Catholic Church, and provided the very first organised secular education for women in Belgium. The Catholic press opposed her work, but the school was a success. Among the teachers were Marie Popelin, Henriette Dachsbeck, and Anna-Augustine Amoré, mother of Marie Janson. Mayor of Brussels Charles Buls was a staunch supporter and assisted in the creation of an advanced, pre-university section in 1891. Gatti retired from educational work in 1899 and entered politics as an activist for the Belgian Labour Party. Her support for universal adult suffrage did not meet with the support of the party's leadership, who expected women to vote for the Catholic Party.  Legacy  In polls held by Belgian TV stations in 2005 to find the greatest Belgians, she was voted 55th in the De Grootste Belg, the Dutch-language series, and 88th in the Le plus grand Belge, the French-language programme. She is buried in Uccle where the street where she lived bears her name.  References  * Gubin, E., & Piette, V., \\"GATTI de GAMOND Isabelle, Laure (1839–1905)\\" in E. Gubin, C. Jacques, V.

His mother was a French governess, Madelina Elizabeth du Bouchet.  Career  Despite his father taking great pains to educate him, and also using his influence to obtain various diplomatic appointments for what he hoped would be a high-flying career, Stanhope was treated with disdain by many, because of his illegitimacy. He was a Member of Parliament for Liskeard and St Germans. The government in 1764 wishing to get possession of his seat, asked him to vacate it, and after some negotiation he agreed, on receiving payment of £1,000, which was half the amount he (or his father) had paid for it. He was also successively Resident at Hamburg (1752–59), Envoy Extraordinary to the Diet of Ratisbon, (1763), and finally on 3 April 1764 was appointed to the Court of Dresden, Saxony.  Family  Stanhope had met his wife Eugenia Peters in Rome in the spring of 1750, while on the Grand Tour. He was just 18, and she 20. Believed (incorrectly) by many to be the illegitimate daughter of an Irish gentleman by the name of Domville, Eugenia was described by one observer as \\"plain almost to ugliness\\" although possessing \\"the most careful education and all the choicest accomplishments of her sex\\". Their two sons, Charles and Philip, were born in London in 1761 and 1763 respectively, and it was not until 25 September 1767 that he and Eugenia were married in Dresden. Stanhope went to great lengths to keep the relationship a secret from his father, to the extent of engaging a separate habitation for his wife and children. He had never lived up to the expectations of his father, unable (by temperament or choice) to acquire the graces that Lord Chesterfield tried so hard to impart. He did not rise as expected in the Diplomatic services, preferring instead an unpretentious domestic life. Often in ill health, he died of dropsy in St Gervais, France on 16 November 1768, aged just 36, and is buried at Vaucluse. It was generally believed that only after the death of his beloved son did Lord Chesterfield learn of the existence of Philip's wife and children. He received them kindly and took upon himself the cost of education and maintenance of his grandsons, becoming very attached to them. When Lord Chesterfield died in 1773, his will caused much gossip: while providing for the two grandsons – £100 annuity each, plus £10,000 – he left Eugenia Stanhope nothing. Faced with the problem of supporting herself, she sold Chesterfield's letters to a publisher (J. Dodsley) for fifteen hundred guineas. Chesterfield had never intended them for publication and the result was a storm of controversy due to their perceived \\"immorality\\", which ensured several reprints, and their steady sale for at least the next one hundred years. Eugenia died at her home in Limpsfield, Surrey in 1783, having acquired property and a comfortable fortune. Eugenia also wrote The deportment of a married life: laid down in a series of letters, which was published in 1798. In a codicil to her will she directed her sons \\"to live in strict unity and friendship with one another, not to dissipate their fortunes and to beware of all human beings.\\" Philip and Eugenia's sons were educated in the law. The elder son Philip married Elizabeth Daniel, had two daughters and died aged 38 in 1801. The survivor of his two daughters, Eugenia Keir, née Stanhope, died at Madeira in 1823, with no surviving issue. The younger son Charles died in 1845, aged 83 without issue, bequeathing most of his estate, which included Lord Chesterfield's bequests to both himself and his late brother, and his mother's properties, to the sons of Elizabeth Daniel's brother Edward Daniel, Barrister at Law.

In his book PiHKAL, the dosage range is listed as 25–200 mg and the duration as 18–24 hours. 3C-BZ Entry in PiHKAL According to anecdotal reports from the substance's entry in PiHKAL, 3C-BZ's effects can vary significantly, ranging from intensified emotions and strange dreams, to effects similar to those of LSD or TMA. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 3C-BZ.  Synthesis  3C-BZ was originally synthesized by Alexander Shulgin starting from 5-methoxyeugenol (4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol) through a reaction with benzyl chloride to form the benzyloxy derivative of 5-methoxyeugenol. The obtained benzyl derivative was reacted with tetranitromethane to form 1-[4-(Benzyloxy)-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl]-2-nitro-1-propene, from which 3C-BZ is obtained by reduction of the nitropropene with lithium aluminum hydride. Another possible synthetic route would be the reaction of benzyl chloride with syringaldehyde to form 3,5-dimethoxy-4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde followed by condensation with nitroethane to form 1-[4-(Benzyloxy)-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl]-2-nitro-1-propene. The obtained nitropropene can be reduced using lithium aluminum hydride, Red-Al, or an aluminum-mercury amalgam.

The book was published on February 13, 2007 by William Morrow. Synopsis Aging rock star Judas Coyne spends his retirement collecting morbid memorabilia, including a witch's confession, a real snuff film and, after being sent an email directly about the item online, a dead man's funeral suit. Jude is informed by Jessica Price, the dead man's daughter, that the old man's spirit is attached to the suit, such that Jude is effectively buying himself a ghost. Jude cannot pass up this creepy opportunity. The suit arrives in a heart- shaped box. Various odd occurrences cause Jude to realize that the ghost is deadly and is out to kill him and those around him. His assistant, Danny Wooten, kills himself, but not before contacting the woman who sent the suit. Jude finds out that the ghost was the stepfather of a groupie, Florida, whom Jude lived with for a few months and who had later committed suicide. The ghost holds Jude responsible for Florida's death and wants revenge. Jude flees his house with his current girlfriend, Georgia, with the ghost in hot pursuit. The ghost's intent is to separate Jude from his two dogs, Angus and Bon, who, as familiars, can protect their owners from the dead. Jude and Georgia take the dogs with them while fleeing south. The dogs save them several times, but the ghost eventually kills them. Jude and Georgia discover that Florida had been hypnotized and molested by her stepfather, Craddock McDermott. When Florida threatened to turn in Craddock and her elder sister Jessica to the police, they killed her and staged her death as a suicide. Later, a dying Craddock hexed the suit and arranged for Jessica to sell it to Jude. After a series of gory battles between Jude and Craddock, Georgia finds a way to contact Florida beyond the grave for help fighting her stepfather's ghost. In the end, Craddock is vanquished, freeing Jude and Georgia from his curse, and Jessica is sent to jail. After surviving the horrendous ordeal, Jude and Georgia eventually marry.

Some of these are notable for supporting symmetric multiprocessing some time before Sun themselves produced multiprocessor systems. Even when Sun produced multiprocessor systems, SunOS uses an asymmetric multiprocessing model rather than OS/MP's symmetric multiprocessing model; Sun would not adopt symmetric multiprocessing until the release of Solaris 2.0 in 1992. Due to the cost of engineering and producing new systems to compete with Sun's increasingly competitive hardware offerings and the loss of symmetric multiprocessing as a distinguishing feature, in 1994, Solbourne left the computer hardware business, with Grumman Systems Support Corporation taking over support for Solbourne customers until 2000. In 1994, Walt Pounds assumed the role of CEO of Solbourne, and the Solbourne headquarters were moved to Boulder, Colorado. From that point until July 2008, Solbourne focused on providing consulting services and solutions based on Oracle Applications and associated technologies.

This volume contains selections from two consecutive shows in California — July 24, 1987, at Oakland Stadium, and July 26, 1987 at Anaheim Stadium. These concerts were recorded during the \\"Dylan & the Dead\\" tour. On this brief tour, the Grateful Dead played two sets followed by a performance by Bob Dylan, with the Dead providing his accompaniment (some of those performances are documented on the album Dylan & the Dead). All four Dead sets from these two dates are included in the release, but the sets with Dylan are not. Also not included are the \\"Touch of Grey\\" encores the Dead played both nights with Dylan on guitar (followed by an additional Dylan song). Additionally, the CD version includes \\"Friend of the Devil\\", \\"Me & My Uncle\\", and \\"Big River\\", which do not appear on the DVD. View from the Vault IV was the first \\"View from the Vault\\" that was not also released on VHS videotape.

It was the final title in the \\"View from the Vault\\" series, and was followed eight months later by The Closing of Winterland DVD/CD set. Content View From The Vault is the fourth installment in the View from the Vault series. It is also the longest one, with four discs. The concerts were part of the Apart and Together Tour, commonly known as the Dylan & The Dead tour. There would be three sets to each show.

It occurs throughout the eastern deciduous forest habitat type, at altitudes of up to 1,500 m (5000 feet) above sea level.Flora of North America: Sassafras albidumU.S. Forest Service: Sassafras albidum (pdf file)Hope College, Michigan: Sassafras albidum It formerly also occurred in southern Wisconsin, but is extirpated there as a native tree. Description Sassafras albidum is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to tall, with a canopy up to wide, with a trunk up to in diameter, and a crown with many slender sympodial branches.Although some sources give 30 or 35 meters as the maximum height, as of 1982 the US champion is only 76 feet (23 meters) tall The bark on trunk of mature trees is thick, dark red-brown, and deeply furrowed. The shoots are bright yellow green at first with mucilaginous bark, turning reddish brown, and in two or three years begin to show shallow fissures. The leaves are alternate, green to yellow-green, ovate or obovate, 10–16 cm (4-6.4 inches) long and 5–10 cm (2-4 inches) broad with a short, slender, slightly grooved petiole. They come in three different shapes, all of which can be on the same branch; three-lobed leaves, unlobed elliptical leaves, and two-lobed leaves; rarely, there can be more than three lobes. In fall, they turn to shades of yellow, tinged with red. The flowers are produced in loose, drooping, few-flowered racemes up to long in early spring shortly before the leaves appear; they are yellow to greenish-yellow, with five or six tepals. It is usually dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate trees; male flowers have nine stamens, female flowers with six staminodes (aborted stamens) and a 2–3 mm style on a superior ovary. Pollination is by insects. The fruit is a dark blue-black drupe long containing a single seed, borne on a red fleshy club-shaped pedicel long; it is ripe in late summer, with the seeds dispersed by birds. The cotyledons are thick and fleshy. All parts of the plant are aromatic and spicy. The roots are thick and fleshy, and frequently produce root sprouts which can develop into new trees.Flora of North America: SassafrasKeeler, H. L. (1900). Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York.Nees von Esenbeck, Christian Gottfried Daniel. 1836. Systema Laurinarum 490. Ecology It prefers rich, well-drained sandy loam with a pH of 6-7, but will grow in any loose, moist soil. Seedlings will tolerate shade, but saplings and older trees demand full sunlight for good growth; in forests it typically regenerates in gaps created by windblow. Growth is rapid, particularly with root sprouts, which can reach 1.2 m (4 feet) in the first year and 4.5 m (15 feet) in 4 years. Root sprouts often result in dense thickets, and a single tree, if allowed to spread unrestrained, will soon be surrounded by a sizable clonal colony, as its stoloniferous roots extend in every direction and send up multitudes of shoots. In terms of its role in the community, S. albidum is a host plant for the caterpillar of the promethea silkmoth, Callosamia promethea. Laurel wilt Laurel wilt is a highly destructive disease initiated when the invasive flying redbay ambrosia beetle (Xyleborus glabratus) introduces its highly virulent fungal symbiont (Raffaelea lauricola) into the sapwood of Lauraceae host shrubs or trees. Sassafras's volatile terpenoids may attract X. glabratus. Sassafras is susceptible to laurel wilt and capable of supporting broods of X. glabratus. Underground transmission of the pathogen through roots and stolons of Sassafras without evidence of X. glabratus attack is suggested. Studies examining the insect's cold tolerance showed that X. glabratus may be able to move to colder northern areas where sassafras would be the main host. The exotic Asian insect is spreading the epidemic from the Everglades through the Carolinas in perhaps less than 15 years by the end of 2014. (search-- resistan)  Humans and Sassafras albidum Parc Oberthür, Rennes All parts of the Sassafras albidum plant have been used for human purposes, including stems, leaves, bark, wood, roots, fruit, and flowers. Sassafras albidum, while native to North America, is significant to the economic, medical, and cultural history of both Europe and North America. In North America, it has particular culinary significance, being featured in distinct national foods such as traditional root beer, filé powder, and Louisiana Creole cuisine. Sassafras albidum was an important plant to many Native Americans of the southeastern United States and was used for many purposes, including culinary and medicinal purposes, before the European colonization of North America. Its significance for Native Americans is also magnified, as the European quest for sassafras as a commodity for export brought Europeans into closer contact with Native Americans during the early years of European settlement in the 16th and 17th centuries, in Florida, Virginia, and parts of the Northeast.  Sassafras albidum and indigenous peoples of the United States  Sassafras with all 3 lobe variations seen. Sassafras albidum was a well-used plant by Native Americans in what is now the southeastern United States prior to the European colonization. The Choctaw word for sassafras is \\"Kvfi.\\" It was known as \\"Winauk\\" in Delaware and Virginia and is called \\"Pauane\\" by the Timuca. Some Native American tribes used the leaves of sassafras to treat wounds by rubbing the leaves directly into a wound, and used different parts of the plant for many medicinal purposes such as treating acne, urinary disorders, and sicknesses that increased body temperature, such as high fevers. They also used the bark as a dye, and as a flavoring. Sassafras wood was also used by Native Americans in the southeastern United States as a fire-starter because of the flammability of its natural oils. In cooking, sassafras was used by some Native Americans to flavor bear fat, and to cure meats. Sassafras is still used today to cure meats. Use of filé powder by the Choctaw in the Southern United States in cooking is linked to the development of gumbo, a signature dish of Louisiana Creole cuisine.  Culinary use by Europeans in North America, and legislation  Also see root beer and filé powder. Sassafras albidum is used primarily in the United States as the key ingredient in home brewed root beer and as a thickener and flavouring in traditional Louisiana Creole gumbo. Filé powder, also called gumbo filé, for its use in making gumbo, is a spicy herb made from the dried and ground leaves of the sassafras tree. It was traditionally used by Native Americans in the Southern United States, and was adopted into Louisiana Creole cuisine. Use of Filé powder by the Choctaw in the Southern United States in cooking is linked to the development of gumbo, the signature dish of Louisiana Creole cuisine that features ground sassafras leaves. Sassafras roots are used to make traditional root beer, although they were banned for commercially mass-produced foods and drugs by the FDA in 1960. Laboratory animals that were given oral doses of sassafras tea or sassafras oil that contained large doses of safrole developed permanent liver damage or various types of cancer. In humans, liver damage can take years to develop and it may not have obvious signs. Along with commercially available Sarsaparilla, sassafras remains an ingredient in use among hobby or microbrew enthusiasts. While sassafras is no longer used in commercially produced root beer and is sometimes substituted with artificial flavors, natural extracts with the safrole distilled and removed are available.http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.580 Most commercial root beers have replaced the sassafras extract with methyl salicylate, the ester found in wintergreen and black birch (Betula lenta) bark. Sassafras tea was also banned in the United States in 1977, but the ban was lifted with the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994. Sassafras twig and terminal bud  Safrole oil, aromatic uses, MDMA  See Safrole. S. albidum is a host plant for the spicebush swallowtail. Safrole can be obtained fairly easily from the root bark of Sassafras albidum via steam distillation. It has been used as a natural insect or pest deterrent. Godfrey's Cordial, as well as other tonics given to children that consisted of opiates, used sassafras to disguise other strong smells and odours associated with the tonics. It was also used as an additional flavouring to mask the strong odours of homemade liquor in the United States. Commercial \\"sassafras oil,\\" which contains safrole, is generally a byproduct of camphor production in Asia or comes from related trees in Brazil. Safrole is a precursor for the manufacture of the drug MDMA, as well as the drug MDA (3-4 methylenedioxyamphetamine) and as such, its transport is monitored internationally. Safrole is a List I precursor chemical according to the DEA. Chemical structure of safrole, a constituent of sassafras essential oil The wood is dull orange brown, hard, and durable in contact with the soil; it was used in the past for posts and rails, small boats and ox-yokes, though scarcity and small size limits current use. Some is still used for making furniture.Missouriplants: Sassafras albidum  History of commercial use of the Sassafras albidum plant  Europeans were first introduced to sassafras, along with other plants such as cranberries, tobacco, and North American ginseng, when they arrived in North America. The aromatic smell of sassafras was described by early European settlers arriving in North America. According to one legend, Christopher Columbus found North America because he could smell the scent of sassafras. As early as the 1560s, French visitors to North America discovered the medicinal qualities of sassafras, which was also exploited by the Spanish who arrived in Florida. English settlers at Roanoke reported surviving on boiled sassafras leaves and dog meat during times of starvation. Upon the arrival of the English on the Eastern coast of North America, sassafras trees were reported as plentiful. Sassafras was sold in England and in continental Europe, where it was sold as a dark beverage called \\"saloop\\" that had medicinal qualities and used as a medicinal cure for a variety of ailments. The discovery of sassafras occurred at the same time as a severe syphilis outbreak in Europe, when little about this terrible disease was understood, and sassafras was touted as a cure. Sir Francis Drake was one of the earliest to bring sassafras to England in 1586, and Sir Walter Raleigh was the first to export sassafras as a commodity in 1602. Sassafras became a major export commodity to England and other areas of Europe, as a medicinal root used to treat ague (fevers) and sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea, and as wood prized for its beauty and durability.Tiffany Leptuck, \\"Medical Attributes of 'Sassafras albidum' - Sassafras\\"], Kenneth M. Klemow, Ph.D., Wilkes-Barre University, 2003 Exploration for sassafras was the catalyst for the 1603 commercial expedition from Bristol of Captain Martin Pring to the coasts of present-day Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. During a brief period in the early 17th century, sassafras was the second-largest export from the British colonies in North America behind tobacco.Martin Pring, \\"The Voyage of Martin Pring, 1603\\", Summary of his life and expeditions at American Journeys website, 2012, Wisconsin Historical Society Since the bark was the most commercially valued part of the sassafras plant due to large concentrations of the aromatic safrole oil, commercially valuable sassafras could only be gathered from each tree once. This meant that as significant amounts of sassafras bark were gathered, supplies quickly diminished and sassafras become more difficult to find. For example, while one of the earliest shipments of sassafras in 1602 weighed as much as a ton, by 1626, English colonists failed to meet their 30-pound quota. The gathering of sassafras bark brought European settlers and Native Americans into contact sometimes dangerous to both groups. Sassafras was such a desired commodity in England, that its importation was included in the Charter of the Colony of Virginia in 1610. Through modern times the sassafras plant, both wild and cultivated, has been harvested for the extraction of safrole, which is used in a variety of commercial products as well as in the manufacture of illegal drugs like MDMA; yet, sassafras plants in China and Brazil are more commonly used for these purposes than North American Sassafras albidum.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Agaña. It is located on the site where the island's first Catholic church was constructed in 1669, under the guidance of Padre San Vitores. The present building looms above the palm trees and is a familiar landmark in downtown Hagåtña. The basilica enshrines the image of Santa Marian Kamalen, Patroness of Guam. History The precursor of the present day Basilica was a chapel, or , constructed of rough logs and nipa thatch built within the perimeter of the Plaza de España. The Church was the focal site around which the administrative buildings were built. Built under the direction of Padre Diego Luís de San Vitores, with the assistance of the Chamorros of Hagåtña, it was dedicated on February 2, 1669.Carano, P., Sanchez, P. C. (1964). A Complete History of Guam. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Co. p. 68. Queen Maria Ana donated 300 pesos and Chief Quipuha of Hagåtña contributed the land. In 1670 a more permanent structure was erected. Built of coral stones with the technique of mamposteria, this structural foundation expanded to become the Cathedral. Within this structure were walls, ceilings and floors constructed of ifil wood. A fresco on the rear wall depicted the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The original Cathedral was destroyed by bombardment during the retaking of Guam. According to historian Benigno Palomo, in 1669, one of the main missions of the Spanish soldiers and missionaries was to exalt \\"the Catholic faith\\" and that \\"the people living in islands and land of this sort, you will and ought to bring to the Christian religion\\", from the Bill of Partition issued by Pope Alexander VI. Other churches were built at Funa near Umatac, at Tepungan by Asan, at Ritidian, at Tarrague, at Dededo and at Orote. Initially, many of these churches were destroyed by the Chamorros in their effort to regain their independence. Others were destroyed by natural causes. Over the years, the Chamorros gradually accepted the faith of the Spanish as their own. Before the war, there were nine churches and 22 chapels throughout Guam. These chapels were little sanctuaries between villages where one could privately pray during the long journey to and from home. All were destroyed during World War II except San Dionisio at Umatac, San Jose at Inarajan and San Francisco at Yona. The Cathedral-Basilica's existing structure has reached its golden age of 50 years after being constructed and dedicated on . The Cathedral- Basilica serves as local landmark and is home to a community of parishioners who regularly attend Sunday Masses, sacred liturgies and annual events. It is also a place where Guam's visitors embrace the island's rich Catholic history and identity. The National Museum of the Dulce Nombre de Maria is located above the Chapel of St. Therese of Lisieux. The museum features changing displays of inspirational art created by local artists.

The station first signed on the air in 2007 as an alternative rock station branded as Fuel 90.3 with its original call letters CFUL-FM, before adopting its current format in 2009. CKMP's studios are located on Centre Street in Eau Claire, while its transmitter is located on Old Banff Coach Road. History=Fuel (2007-2009) On August 2, 2006, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application by Newcap Broadcasting for a new adult album alternative radio station to serve the city of Calgary. The station soft launched for testing on March 17, 2007 under the brand name Fuel 90.3, with the callsign CFUL-FM. Program director Murray Brookshaw explained that the main goal of Fuel was to \\"respect the music of the past but [..] uncover the new as well\\", promising a balance between classic rock hits and modern material. Among the station's initial on-air personalities were two alumni from CFGQ-FM, including morning co-host Frazier (who worked a similar position at CFGQ when it was the top 40-formatted Power 107), and midday host Laurie Healey (who worked for the station when it was the adult contemporary-formatted The Peak 107.3). In 2009, the CRTC approved a request by Newcap to increase the power of CFUL's signal to an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts. Amp Radio (2009-present) On June 20, 2009, at 6PM, after playing \\"Know Your Enemy\\" by Green Day, CFUL flipped to Top 40/CHR as 90.3 Amp Radio; the new format launched with a marathon of 10,000 songs played commercial-free, with the first being \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" by Rihanna.http://formatchange.com/fuel-90-3-cful-calgary-becomes-amp-radio-ckmp/ Afterwards, the station changed its call sign to CKMP-FM. Previous Amp Radio 90.3 logo Following the switch to Amp, the station began attracting controversy for a number of unconventional on-air promotions. In June 2011, CKMP held a contest known as Breast Summer Ever—in which the station would give away a breast implant, valued at $10,000. Entrants submitted a photo of themselves and explained why they wanted the implant; a shortlist of 10 entries were chosen by judges, and the winner was decided by an online poll. The contest was met with mixed reaction; the station's program manager Kris Mazurak stated that the contest had received a positive reaction, given that \\"somebody out there that wants that prize\\", while a critic believed that the promotion could have a positive response if the prize were to go to someone in legitimate need of a breast implant, such as a woman suffering from breast cancer. However, the station also received criticism for the promotion, particularly from those who felt that it was sexist and promoted the objectification of women (even though the station did not specifically restrict the contest to females), and the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council received two complaints about the contest upon its introduction. After receiving 76% of 30,000 votes, the implant was awarded to a trans woman who had been affected by the provincial government's decision to drop funding for gender reassignment operations as part of budget cuts. In March 2013, CKMP's morning show held a stunt contest entitled Bank It or Burn It, in which listeners were asked to vote via social media on whether $5,000 in cash would be saved, or burned in an incinerator. If a majority of listeners voted to save the money, those who voted in favor would be entered into a contest with the money as a prize. Ultimately, 54% of viewers voted in favour of burning the money, which was presented in a video set to Ellie Goulding's song \\"Burn\\". Reaction to the stunt was negative; local charities complained that the money could have been donated instead of burned (and in turn, encouraged listeners to donate themselves), a listener started a petition demanding that CKMP be taken off the air, and others questioned the legality of the stunt—however, Canadian law only bans the burning of coins, and not paper currency. Morning show host Katie Summers defended the stunt, stating that \\"Part of me is glad we burned the money. A week ago, all of the same people and all of the same charities in this city were just as in need. Only now, after an awfully tragic social experiment, are they the forefront of everyone's mind. Maybe this sparked a conversation we needed to have.\\" In turn, the station announced it would perform a second round of Bank It or Burn It, but with $10,000 instead. This time, listeners voted to save the money; additionally, the station announced that it would donate $10,000 to the Children's Wish Foundation in the name of the contest's winner.  2014 \\"QuickHitz\\" re-launch  On July 22, 2014, CKMP's program director Paul Kaye left the station to pursue a position at newly acquired sister station CKZZ-FM in Vancouver. At the same time, the station dropped on-air talent and began counting down to an impending \\"update\\" on August 1 at 9:00 a.m. local time. AMP Radio Calgary Updates At that time, CKMP re-launched as simply 90.3 Amp; while staying as a top 40 station, CKMP adopted a new syndicated format known as \\"QuickHitz\\", in which the station played edited versions of songs that had been cut to one- and-a-half to two minutes in length, primarily by removing additional choruses and shortening intros. The station promoted that under the new format, it could play approximately 24 songs per hour with only 9 minutes of commercials—doubling the amount of total music played per-hour. Developed by the Vancouver-based firm Sparknet Communications, CKMP was the first Canadian station to adopt the QuickHitz format full-time—it was first introduced by a station in the United States in September 2013. CKMP also introduced hourly \\"First Play\\" tracks, which present new songs popular in other countries and among social media users. Steve Jones, Newcap Radio's vice president of programming, explained that the format was designed to suit modern listening habits; research concluded that the convention of three to four-and-a-half minute radio edits (a concept which dates back to the 1950s and the need to fit singles on 45 rpm records) was dated, as listeners would use their portable music players to skip through and only listen to portions of songs—developing a short attention span to music. He also noted that with the ability to hear at least six to eight songs in a fifteen-minute span, listeners would feel a better \\"sense of momentum and energy\\" with the new format. Newcap chose to pilot the format in Calgary, noting the tight market for CHR stations, and because Calgary was a \\"progressive, young forward- thinking city\\"; the company did not rule out implementing the format on its other stations. The new format was met with mixed reception; musician Jann Arden made numerous remarks attacking CKMP on Twitter (despite her music not being played by the station because it does not fit its format), contending that the edited songs were unethical and disrespectful to the artists work. She called for a boycott of CKMP due to the changes, and among other remarks, jokingly announced that the NHL had shortened its games to be only one period long, and asked her followers to recommend her \\"half a good book\\" to read. In response to the boycott, Newcap pulled Jann Arden's music from all of its stations. Jones stated that the response to the format was \\"generally quite favourable\\", with many listeners praising the increased amount of music, but noted that Arden was the only artist to have complained about it yet. After only three weeks with the format, CKMP dropped QuickHitz on August 19, 2014, and reverted to a standard top 40 format. Jones admitted that while the format \\"was greeted with a lot of curiosity\\", Newcap had received a number of legal threats about the format, particularly from Canadian artists. He explained that \\"in order to successfully do this we were going to face a lengthy and divisive and expensive legal process that we weren't willing to do right now, especially when some of those would come from the very content providers we work with—they are partners in our success.\\" In regards to Arden's complaints, Jones stated that \\"we have tremendous amount of respect for the artists that we play and the artists we don't play, and the music they make\\", but admitted that he foresaw the possibility of complaints. As of December 2014 numbers, Numeris ranked CKMP-FM as the 11th highest-rated station in the Calgary market per PPM data, with a 4.5 share. These numbers trailed behind its CHR competitors CIBK-FM (6.4 share) and CHFM-FM (7.2 share).

Zarlenga argues that this would mean money would be issued by government interest free and spent into circulation to promote the general welfare, and that substantial expenditures on infrastructure, including human infrastructure (education and health care) would become the predominant method of putting new money into circulation.W. Krehm, Review of Zarlenga's Lost Science of Money, Economic Reform Australia, Vol 3 No 18, July–August 2005 Research results are published in Zarlenga's book, The Lost Science of Money. The book asserts that money did not emerge from barter between individuals, but rather through trade between tribes and as part of religious worship and sacrifice. Though this is not the mainstream view, there are other scholars of money, such as Keith Hart,Money in an Unequal World, Keith Hart who agree that money developed in this way. The reason this distinction is believed to be important is because, according to Zarlenga, it is the definition of money which determines how the public will allow the money supply to be controlled. If money is a commodity to be traded, then all that matters is that the money is 100% backed by some commodity, like gold or silver for example. If money is credit, then it makes sense that bankers control it, as they do in the United States today. But if money is an artifact of law, whose value is derived from law (payment of taxes and legal tender laws) then Zarlenga argues it would only be proper for the government to issue, and control the money supply.Stephen Zarlenga, The Lost Science Of Money, Ch. 24: \\"Proposals For U.S. Monetary Reform\\" According to Zarlenga, it is this last definition that is supported by the history and nature of money. Government-controlled money is also postulated to be more stable than credit money or commodity money. Coins have been claimed to represent an advance over weighing out precious metals with a fixed amount of precious metal being stamped so they need not be weighed and could be exchanged more conveniently than lumps of metal which needed to be weighed.The History of Money, Jack Weatherford Conferences The 13th Annual AMI Monetary Reform Conference was held at the University Center, in Chicago, September 2017.

Punta Arenas was designed to house the supervisors and administrative staff of the International Petroleum Company (IPC), which was later to become BP Oil. There is a resemblance between Punta Arenas and the area of Coral Gables, Florida, which is coincidentally where the headquarters of the IPC used to be in the 1940s. The neighborhood was organized around the letters of the alphabet. Each block of ten houses was assigned a letter, and each house was given a number. Therefore, a given house would be B-10, or W-5. As years went by, and as need for more houses grew, letter combinations like CH and Z were added. Once an employee of the company (originally Americans) was appointed supervisor, he and his family were relocated and entitled to one of these houses on a loan basis. Some blocks of houses were specifically designed for unmarried persons, featuring individual rooms with shared bathrooms. When Punta Arenas came into existence, it featured all the facilities that a resident American family would need: 110-volt A/C, a constant gas supply, an exclusive two–pool club for residents, a beach, one private residence for the company manager and another one for official guests overlooking the beach, and an elementary and middle school which initially followed the American school system. Sidewalks were nonexistent, although unnecessary due to the 25 km/h speed limit that ruled. All houses were equally attractive and comfortable: red bricks, flat roofs, ample space, roomy areas and manicured lawns. As time went by, and as the Peruvian government took over the oil refinery after a coup, electric power gradually moved to Peruvian standards (220 volts), and the school started to follow the Peruvian school system, offering secondary education. Still, the campsite was definitely the most convenient and safest place to grow a family. During the 1970s, Punta Arenas kept a certain reminiscence of its initial years: A few Americans remained in Talara and, thus, lived in the area. Certain American customs like Thanksgiving and Halloween were kept until all the American citizens left or retired from the oil company (renamed as Petroperú). In the 1980s, virtually no Americans lived in Talara or in Punta Arenas. The economic crisis of the time, mostly caused by Alan García's first disastrous government period, turned Punta Arenas into a source of envy to low-income families who lived in the outskirts of Talara and who saw Punta Arenas and its inhabitants as beneficiaries of a series of privileges that no others could have access to. As an example: During the floods of 1983 (caused by \\"El Niño\\"), while the population of the city struggled to find food at excessive prices, Petroperú took great care of its supervisors and its families by making sure that food supplies (including fresh meat and poultry) were shipped over by specially-chartered airplane flights. Other privileges that supervisors and families enjoyed were transportation, free education, school materials, water, electricity and gas, something that was clearly a catch for anyone who accepted to relocate in a now-isolated area of the country. Towards the end of the 20th century, Punta Arenas became slowly uninhabited due to the fall of Petroperú and its management problems caused by Alberto Fujimori's treatment of the company's funds as a source of petty cash for the country. The so-called \\"luxury\\" in the area did not seem to match the crisis in the rest of Peru. As an attempt to keep Punta Arenas alive, the houses were offered for sale or rent to private third parties, which did not prove successful. In recent years, many of the houses have been vandalized and demolished, partly because of the lack of use and maintenance. Only the houses that surround the club and the school remain. Peruvian psychoanalyst Jorge Bruce has written Arena de Punta Arenas (1981), a short stories book, about Punta Arenas during the management of IPC at the beginning of the 1960s.

The smock is typically a simple, sturdily quilted, collarless, sleeveless gown with adjustable openings at the shoulders and down the front that are closed with nylon hook-and-loop or similar fasteners. The thickness of the garment makes it impossible to roll or fold the garment so it can be used as a noose. It is not a restraint and provides modesty and warmth while not impeding the mobility of the wearer. The suit covers all private areas as the wearer is to be naked under the suit for their own protection. These items are formally known as Safety Smocks and were designed and developed by Lonna Speer in 1989 while she was a nurse working in the Santa Cruz, California, county jail. Safety Smocks are now standard issue throughout jails and prisons in the United States. The same material is used for the anti-suicide blanket. Prior to use of the Safety Smock many jails and prisons stripped inmates naked and held them in a stripped down padded cell with no furniture or protrusions of any kind. Some facilities opted to use paper gowns to provide modesty. The American Correctional Association (ACA) has established use of appropriate Safety Smocks and Safety Blankets as one of the Standards used to judge jails and prisons for accreditation. Demand for Safety Smocks to meet this ACA Standard led to multiple clothing makers creating similar garments of varying strength and of various materials. In addition to the Safety Smock, Lonna Speer developed the Safety Blanket and the Safe Sleeping Bag, all made from the quilted heavy nylon material, as well as The Dozer, a Suicide Cell mattress, the Safety Pillow, and Safety Slippers.

The organization was founded on September 10, 1982 with Vice-admiral Hoàng Cơ Minh elected as chairman, which operated underground for two decades. On September 19, 2004, then-chairman Nguyễn Kim introduced Viet Tan as a public organization. Viet Tan's activities are rooted in the promotion of non-violent political change in Vietnam. The organization is outlawed in Vietnam and the government of Vietnam considers it \\"a terrorist force\\". The U.S. government, most notably former U.S. Ambassador Michael Michalak, rejected this view, while United Nations describes Viet Tan as \\"a peaceful organization advocating for democratic reform\\". Objectives The Viet Tan aims to establish democracy and reform Vietnam through peaceful means, focusing on empowering the Vietnamese people, supporting the development of civil society, and promoting pluralism in Vietnam. Specifically, Viet Tan seeks to roll back existing restrictions against basic rights by promoting a de facto free media, supporting grassroots movements, training and capacity building and engaging in international advocacy. Viet Tan sees the strength and resources of the Vietnamese people as the impetus for achieving political change and restoring civil rights. Non-violent struggle Viet Tan embraces the non-violent struggle approach to reform. The organization believes that change has to come from within Vietnam and come from the bottom up. Human Rights Watch have repeatedly stated that the organization \\"has worked for peaceful political reform, democracy, and human rights in Vietnam\\". The organization has outlined the following steps to democratizing Vietnam: *Improving Social Welfare & Restoring Civil Rights *Promoting Pluralism *Building Collective Strength *Expanding the Knowledge Base *Investing in the Future Generation *Lobbying International Support *Strengthening the Overseas Vietnamese Community *Building the Foundation to Reform Vietnam *Protecting National Interests and Territorial Integrity *Restoring Truth to Recent History Outside of Vietnam, Viet Tan frequently meets with members of the United States Congress, the Parliament of Australia, Parliament of Canada, and members of the European Union and given key testimonies on issues of human rights, Internet Freedom, and political repression. Viet Tan also advises organizations on using trade to leverage human rights. In a radio interview with Australia Radio station 2SER, Viet Tan representative Phong Nguyen states that \\"our mission is to promote human rights, democracy and to end social injustice by peaceful nonviolent means based civic participation\\", though he recognizes that the Vietnamese government regards them as a terrorist organization, despite a lack of evidence. In a statement released in 2013 following the conviction of Vietnamese dissidents accused of being members of Viet Tan, the organization states that it \\"believes that gaining an understanding of nonviolent civil resistance, digital security and leadership skills are both empowering and the right of every free individual.\\" The United Nations have also noted that \\"Viet Tan is a peaceful organization advocating for democratic reform.\\" The Vietnamese government has also publicly acknowledged that it finds Viet Tan members handing out pamphlets on non-violent peace protests. Membership Viet Tan has members and supporters throughout Vietnam and around the world, its network inside Vietnam comprises intellectuals, university students, and workers. While membership is by-invitation-only, Viet Tan does send out mass emails to people in Vietnam to recruit potential members. Viet Tan held its 6th Party Congress in September 2006. Members were elected the Central Committee headed by Đỗ Hoàng Điềm as chairman and Ly Thai Hung as general secretary. History=Beginnings: 1982–2004 On September 10, 1982, the National United Front for the Liberation of Vietnam (NUFRONLIV) was founded by various groups in Vietnam, with Hoang Co Minh elected as president. Two years later, this group was then later reorganized into Viet Tan, when it became a worldwide underground movement. While the former had the primary aim to topple the communist regime through a popular uprising, the latter aims at renovating Vietnam through political and peaceful means. During the period of 1982 to 1987 Hoang Co Minh also served as the organization's chair, until he was ambushed by Vietnamese soldiers while leading a group of members into Vietnam. In the period that followed, Viet Tan remained an underground organization with undisclosed projects and campaigns. Going public in 2004 Viet Tan chairman Đỗ Hoàng Điềm (2nd from right) meets with U.S. President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney on May 29, 2007 urging the president to increase pressure on Vietnam to respect human rights On September 19, 2004, in a highly publicized event in Berlin, Germany, the organization stepped out as a public organization, announcing the dissolution of the NUFRONLIV, and a recommitment to establish democracy in Vietnam through peaceful means. In September 2006, Viet Tan sent members to testify before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in Washington, D.C.. On May 29, 2007, chairman Đỗ Hoàng Điềm was invited by US president George W. Bush together with three other Vietnamese-American activists to the White House on a meeting about Vietnam's increasingly harsh treatment of anti-government activists and an upcoming visit by Vietnam's president Nguyen Minh Triet to the United States. During the 45-minute meeting, Đỗ Hoàng Điềm urged the president to increase pressure on Vietnam to respect human rights and asked for the United States to support openly democratic forces to bring change to Hanoi. During Nguyen Minh Triet's visit to the US, Đỗ Hoàng Điềm also met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shortly before her meeting with the Vietnamese president to stress the importance of raising the issue of Vietnam's poor human rights record. 2009 testimony before Parliament of Australia On March 19, 2009 Viet Tan members (including Đỗ Hoàng Điềm) also testified before the Parliament of Australia Human Rights Sub-Committee on Vietnam's recent development on worker's rights abuses, religious freedom and arbitrary arrests. This was also followed up in November 2009, when Viet Tan organized a democracy dinner with Australian politicians Alistair Coe and George Lemon who both received honorary member status for Viet Tan given their support and work for the non-violent struggle for democracy in Vietnam 2010 public appearances in Hanoi Viet Tan organizes civic action in Hanoi on October 9, 2010 On March 14, 2010 Viet Tan members gathered in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi, Vietnam to assert Vietnam's maritime claims to the Paracel and Spratly Island. They distributed T-shirts and hats with slogans that were prohibited by the Vietnamese government. A similar protest against China's actions over disputed maritime territories occurred on October 8, 2010 with approximately 70 members of Viet Tan in attendance in Hanoi, Vietnam. The members said it was their responsibility as citizens to speak out, and passed out T-shirts and hats calling for the government to defend its right to sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea. Arrests=2007 arrests On November 17, 2007, three Viet Tan members, US citizens Nguyen Quoc Quan, a mathematics researcher, and Truong Van Ba, a Hawaiian restaurant owner, and Frenchwoman Nguyen Thi Thanh Van, a contributor to Viet Tan's Radio Chan Troi Moi radio show, were arrested in Ho Chi Minh City. At the time, they were leading a \\"democracy seminar\\" and preparing pro-democracy pamphlets, when 20 security officers raided the house. In addition, Thai citizen Somsak Khunmi and two Vietnamese nationals, Nguyen The Vu, a trader, and his brother Nguyen Trong Khiem were also arrested. Three days later, on November 20, 2007, Vietnamese security police arrested Nguyen Viet Trung, a Vietnamese citizen, in Phan Thiết. Born 1979, Nguyen Viet Trung is a businessman and younger brother of Nguyen The Vu. The arrests were not officially confirmed by the Vietnamese government until November 22, 2007. During the press briefing, officials declined to state which laws the detained individuals have broken, nor released any information about Nguyen Quoc Quan, whose whereabouts remained unknown for a week. In response to the arrest, Viet Tan launched a worldwide awareness campaign under the name of Free Them Now, that included a petition to request the US, French and Thai government for assistance in demanding an immediate release of the individuals. Coinciding with the International Human Rights Day on December 10, rallies were organized in Paris, Sydney and Washington, D.C.. On November 24, 2007, Vietnamese security police released university student Nguyen Trong Khiem after detaining him for a week without cause. On December 12, 2007, after weeks of protests and appeals by U.S. lawmakers and international pro-democracy movements, Vietnam released American citizen Truong Van Ba shortly after the U.S. ambassador Michael Michalak demanded to see evidence of terrorism or other charges to justify their detention.Vietnam Frees 3 U.S. Citizens, CBS 2007-12-13 Nguyen Quoc Quan remained detained in Vietnam, with the U.S. Consulate allowed to visit him once per month. However, family visits were not allowed. His wife was granted a visa to visit him in January 2008, though the Vietnamese consulate revoked the visa one week prior her scheduled trip. Democracy activist visits with US Congressman Mike Honda in 2008, after his release from prison in Vietnam On March 12, 2008, chairman of Viet Tan, Đỗ Hoàng Điềm, appeared before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs along with Nguyen Quoc Quan's wife to appeal to lawmakers to confront the issue. During a behind-closed- doors trial in Vietnam on May 13, 2008, Nguyen Quoc Quan was sentenced to 6 months in prison, but since he had already served that time, was released on May 17, 2008 and deported back to the United States. Nguyen The Vu was released immediately, and Somsak Kunmi will serve another three months before he will be released. Other than the sentences, the presiding judge would not release any further detail of the trial. 2008 arrests Following the 2007 arrests, three additional Viet Tan members, Nguyen Thi Xuan Trang, a medical doctor from Switzerland, Mai Huu Bao, an electrical engineer from the United States and past Executive Board Member of the Union of Vietnamese Student Associations of Southern California as well as Nguyen Tan Anh, a manager of a health-care non-profit from Australia, attempted a visit of Nguyen Quoc Quan in Ho Chi Minh City. On April 4, 2008, the three Viet Tan members visited the Ministry of Public Security detention center in Ho Chi Minh City, but were detained by security police. The three were released two days later and expelled from Vietnam. 2010 arrests In July and August 2010, a new series of arrests by the Vietnamese government was made. The arrests included Pham Minh Hoang, a 55-year-old French-educated lecturer in applied mathematics at the Ho Chi Minh City Institute of Technology, Duong Kim Khai (a pastor in the Mennonite Church), Tran Thi Thuy (a merchant) and Nguyen Thanh Tam (a farmer). Hoang's wife believed her husband was arrested because he supported the protests against controversial Chinese-run bauxite mines in Vietnam's Central Highlands. Hoang remains in police custody since August 13, 2010. Reporters Without Borders and the Committee of Concerned Scientists condemned the government's consistent use of conspiracy theories to arrest dissidents. Following a peaceful demonstration of Viet Tan party members in Hanoi to affirming Vietnamese sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Island, Mrs. Hong Vo, a 53-year-old social worker from Melbourne, Australia was arrested in the evening of October 10, 2010. The arrest occurred at the airport, as Mrs. Vo was boarding a plan to return to Australia. Her son was on a phone call with her, when the phone call ended abruptly. After the Australian consulate in Vietnam intervened in the case, Hong Vo was released from prison on October 21, 2010 and immediately expelled from the country without the possibility for her to ever return. 2011 arrests Following the peaceful demonstration with Vietnamese farmers who protest the government's confiscation of their land, Viet Tan members Jennifer Truong, Nguyen Ly Trong and Nguyen Quang Khanh were arrested in Ho Chi Minh City on March 16, 2011. While the arrest was confirmed by the Vietnamese police, no further information was provided. In May 2011, three Viet Tan members along with four other land activists were tried during a one-day, closed trial and sentenced to prison for two to seven years. The activists, including Tran Thi Thuy and Duong Kim Khai were lobbying for land rights in Bến Tre and offered legal advice to farmers whose land has been confiscated by the government. During the trial, the defendants were denied access to a lawyer, and members of the US Congress, led by Representative Ed Royce, wrote a letter asking for their release. 2012 arrests On April 17, 2012, Nguyen Quoc Quan was arrested again at Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City. Government officials did not confirm his arrest until five days later. He is detained on charges of terrorism and for planning to \\"instigate a demonstration\\" during the anniversary of the Fall of Saigon. He is being detained for at least four months. According to his wife, he was planning to visit his younger sister and \\"talk about democracy and the rule of law\\". The U.S. consulate in Vietnam has confirmed that he has been arrested, but no formal charges have been filed and has not been granted a lawyer. Six members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and urged the State Department to call for Dr. Quan's immediate release on grounds that the Vietnamese government is \\"abusing its vague national security provisions as the pretext to arrest and detain individuals who peacefully advocate for religious and political freedom.\\" Following intense US pressure, he was then deported on January 30, 2013 after spending nine months in prison. 2013 convictions 14 activists, many associated with the Roman Catholic Redemptionist movement, arrested in 2011 after attending Viet Tan training in Thailand, were convicted of subversion after a two-day trial in Vinh, in Nghệ An Province, and sentenced in January 2013 for periods ranging from 3 to 13 years. Defendants included Dang Xuan Dieu, Dang Ngoc Minh, Ho Duc Hoa, Ho Van Oanh, Paulus Lê Sơn, Nguyen Dang Minh Man, Nguyen Dang Vinh Phuc, Nguyen Dinh Cuong, Nguyen Van Duyet, Nguyen Van Oai, Nguyen Xuan Oanh, Nong Hung Anh, Thai Van Dung, and Tran Minh Nhat. During this time, Viet Tan chairman Đỗ Hoàng Điềm went on public media including Saigon Broadcasting Television Network as well as Al Jazeera to speak out against this \\"blatant crackdown.\\" Campaigns Viet Tan recruitment and infobooth centre in Canada. Internet Freedom Campaign In response to Vietnam's appeal to Internet companies Microsoft, Google and Yahoo to work with the Vietnamese government to restrict blogging about dissident material and hand over information that could lead to arrests, Viet Tan launched the \\"Internet Freedom Campaign\\". Under this campaign, Viet Tan released a report stating that the Vietnamese ministry has expressed the wish that foreign Internet companies \\"comply with provisions in the new decree, including providing personal information on bloggers to government authorities upon request.\\" Through this lobbying campaign, 16 members of the US Congress have already co-signed a joint letter to the CEOs of each company to express their concerns about \\"the worsening Internet restrictions in Vietnam.\\". In October 2010, the organization also started the No Firewall portal, that provided documentation on digital security and how to circumvent the Vietnamese government firewall. In April 2012, the organization obtained a decree entitled Decree on the Management, Provision, Use of Internet Services and Information Content Online that was drafted by the Vietnamese government that would ask internet companies to censor blogs, release blogger information and possibly house data centers in Vietnam for the purpose of censorship and regulation of social media. Viet Tan published an editorial describing the draft policy and called for US companies to resist it. Reporters Without Borders later confirmed that the decree exists and that it was meant to be enacted in June 2012. Save Tây Nguyên campaign In 2009, Viet Tan has been very vocal about the planned bauxite mining in the central area of Tây Nguyên. Under an agreement between the Chinese government and the Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng, Chinese companies were allowed access to the central highlands of Tây Nguyên for bauxite mining. Environmental concerns about bauxite mining sparked widespread international opposition among scientists, intellectuals and former soldiers. Prominent Vietnamese lawyer Le Cong Dinh was very vocal about the bauxite mining, and as a result was arrested on June 13, 2009 by the Vietnamese police force. Free Thuy-Nhan-Nghien campaign In response to the imprisonment of human rights and democracy activists Tran Khai Thanh Thuy, Le Thi Cong Nhan and Pham Thanh Nghien, Viet Tan launched the Free Thuy-Nhan-Nghien campaign in March 2010. The campaign included a call to spread awareness on social media outlets. One Million Against 79 campaign With many Vietnamese pro-democracy activists being arrested under article 79 of the Vietnamese penal code that bans \\"carrying out activities aimed at overthrowing the people's administration.\\" Viet Tan has started the One Million Against 79 campaign that solicits videos from individuals voicing their opposition against article 79. Reporters Without Borders also noted the government's systematic use of conspiracy theories and article 79 to arrest dissidents. Programs=New Horizon Radio Since 1992, Viet Tan has operated a daily radio broadcast to Vietnam under the name \\"New Horizon Radio\\" (Radio Chân Trời Mới). The program airs every night from 8:30pm to 9:00pm on AM 1503. Despite efforts to jam the broadcast by the government, it can be heard in most areas of the country. The episodes are also available online as a podcast. Friends of Viet Tan Viet Tan started a social networking outreach program through the Friends of Viet Tan community that allows like-minded activists to follow news and activities about Vietnam and Viet Tan and also participate in the discussion. The program was first launched as a Facebook application that allowed other users to suggest their own newsworthy articles and references to a main feed that was replicated to many other websites. The application also syndicated Radio Chân Trời Mới as a podcast, and in 2009 also introduced a vodcast. Digital activism seminars On November 14–15, 2009, Viet Tan organized a seminar on \\"Digital Activism: A Tool for Change in Vietnam\\" held at Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C. Incidentally, in the same week, the Vietnamese government decided to block Facebook through its internet firewall. In response, seminar attendees produced viral videos and documentation on how to circumvent Vietnam's firewall to access Facebook as well as a viral video called Facebook Back that uses modified lyrics of Justin Timberlake's Sexyback The same seminar was repeated February 27–28, 2010 at Chapman University in Orange, California, which was co-sponsored by the Asian Pacific Law Student Association and the Vietnamese American Law Student Association. The seminar also took place at Harvard University from October 16–17, 2010. On March 9, 2010, Viet Tan Spokesman Duy Hoang presented on \\"Digital Activism in Vietnam\\" at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights, Tolerance and Democracy and was one of the panelist to discuss 'Next Generation: Young Rights Defenders and the Blogosphere'.

Gary (DE-326) was an . The ship was named for Seaman 2nd Class Thomas Jones Gary. The ship was renamed Thomas J. Gary on 1 January 1945 to free the name for planned light cruiser . Gary (DE-326) was laid down on 15 June 1943 at Orange, Texas by the Consolidated Steel Corporation; launched on 21 August 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Wille Mae Gary, mother of Seaman 2nd Class Gary and commissioned on 27 November 1943, Lieutenant Commander William H. Harrison, USNR, in command. US Navy service history Following shakedown exercises out of Bermuda and post-shakedown overhaul at Charleston, Gary reported to the Commander Caribbean Sea Frontier at Guantanamo Bay for temporary duty on 5 February 1944. She was detached from that command on 9 March and set her course for the Straits of Gibraltar, escorting the first of many transatlantic convoys. Until May 1945, Thomas J. Gary operated as an escort vessel in the Atlantic, safely screening eleven convoys from the East Coast to ports in the Mediterranean and the United Kingdom and back to the United States. Here is a list of the ETO convoys: Casablanca Algiers (twice) Tunisia Naples Taranto, Italy Southampton (twice) Plymouth Portsmouth Liverpool While on the east coast between patrols, Gary trained off the coast of Maine and out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and conducted antisubmarine warfare exercises out of New London. During June 1944, she was assigned to the Navy Fleet Sound School. In December 1944, she detached from the homebound convoy she was escorting from British ports to aid which had collided with a merchantman. On the 9th, she took on board more than 100 Coast Guardsmen from the badly damaged patrol escort vessel and then screened her as she was towed to Bermuda. Pacific Duty While the ship was moored at Boston on 1 January 1945, her name was expanded to Thomas J. Gary. She completed her last Atlantic convoy upon her arrival at New York on 7 May and spent the remainder of the month preparing for service in the Pacific. Following refresher training in the Caribbean, she departed waters of the coast of Haiti on 22 June; steamed - via the Panama Canal - to the west coast; and departed San Diego on 12 July with the convoy bound for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 20 July to begin repairs and training. On 1 August, she departed Oahu with Escort Division 57 and steamed for Saipan. After a brief stop at Eniwetok, she was rerouted to Guam and arrived at Apra Harbor on the 13th. The same day, she again got underway; this time with Carrier Division 27. As the force steamed toward the Philippines, word of Japan's surrender reached the ship. Following her arrival at San Pedro Bay on 17 August, Thomas J. Gary remained in port until the 29th when she departed Leyte to screen the aircraft carriers of Task Group (TG) 77.1 during their passage to Korea. Voyage to Japan Bob Redmon says \\"Toward the end of the war we were part of a task force that was probably larger than the one on D-Day. This task force was commanded by Admiral Kincaid and we were underway for the first invasion of the Japanese mainland. Now get this, we were running escort for the battleship on which Seaman Gary lost his life at Pearl Harbor. Still gives me goose bumps. We knew something was up. We had left Okinawa for the invasion. Since we were only about 300 miles from the Japanese coast we had no idea why it was taking so long. Of course when we started dropping the big bombs we understood. I still would have liked for the big boys who were sunk at Pearl to have had a chance to lob those 16 inchers ashore and say \\"hey, Japs, look who's here.\\" especially the California.\\" (NOTE: USS California has 14 inch main guns, not 16 inchers. 16s were on the Colorado, North Carolina, South Dakota and Iowa Class battleships) En route, the task group was diverted to Formosa. With Commander Escort Division 57 embarked, Thomas J. Gary was designated to liberate Allied prisoners of war (POW) who had been held on that island. On 3 September, she embarked 19 marines from charged with arranging the details of the evacuation of the POW's. Her division commander was also responsible for making the preliminary arrangements for the occupation of Formosa. Before dawn of 5 September off the coast of Formosa, Thomas J. Gary and were detached from the escort carrier task group. The destroyer escorts were without navigational guides to indicate the location of mines in water surrounding the island. Despite the signing of the peace some days before, resistance from die-hard Japanese was a distinct possibility. At 0718, as the two ships approached the waters most apt to be mined, every precaution was taken to minimize damage and casualties, should the ships strike a mine. The American sailors maintained a state of readiness to repel possible attack, as Thomas J. Gary, with her sister ship 500 yards astern, threaded her way at nine knots through the unknown and dangerous waters. Four Combat Air Patrol planes provided cover, and two anti-mine sweep planes from the carriers relayed word of the sightings of possible mines as the destroyer escorts picked their way through the hazardous approaches to Kiirun, making frequent changes of course to avoid sonar contacts which exhibited a suspicious similarity to those made by mines. One mile north of Kiirun Island, she rendezvoused with a small Japanese tug which led the way into Kiirun Harbor, where a Japanese harbor pilot pointed out the dock to be used. The ships maintained a condition of modified general quarters and stationed armed guards on shore. A detail headed by Thomas J. Garys communications officer took over the local Japanese radio station to insure reliable communications between the task group and Japanese authorities in Kiirun for the duration of the evacuation operation. Finally, at 1630, a train arrived bearing Allied prisoners of war who were quickly transferred to the waiting destroyer escorts. At 1800, provided now with a Japanese pilot and Japanese charts of the minefields in the vicinity of Kiirun, Thomas J. Gary got underway. Her commanding officer later dryly reported: \\"Our outbound route did not coincide with the one used inbound since we discovered that our inbound track crossed several minefields.\\" That night, she rendezvoused with the carriers and transferred the newly freed POW's to the larger ships. On 6 September, Thomas J. Gary, joined by other destroyer escorts, returned to Kiirun to transport additional POW's. After transferring most other passengers to Block Island, she got underway for Manila; and, on 9 September, she arrived at Manila to discharge the last 50 of her POW's. Duties in the Far East and Europe Later in the month, Thomas J. Gary steamed on to the Ryukyu Islands with the escort carrier group: and she operated out of Okinawa into October, conducting exercises in the East China Sea. On 19 October, while at sea with the escort carrier group, she struck a submerged log, which caused considerable damage to her starboard propeller. Slowed to , she was forced to leave the formation and put in at Saipan on 23 November for repairs. She next operated in the Philippines into the new year with calls at Hong Kong and Okinawa. The destroyer escort departed Singapore on 8 April 1946 and set her course via the Suez Canal for the Mediterranean where she spent much of May visiting European ports. On 29 May, Thomas J. Gary arrived at Charleston to commence dry-docking and preservation procedures. On 25 September, tug Nancy Moran towed the destroyer escort from Charleston and headed for Green Cove Springs, Florida. She was decommissioned there on 7 March 1947 and placed in reserve. DER-326 On 24 July 1956, Thomas J. Gary was delivered to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for conversion to radar picket escort ship; and, on 1 November 1956, she was designated DER-326. She was re-commissioned on 2 August 1957 and spent the remainder of the year in training exercises out of Newport, Rhode Island, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On 30 December, she departed Newport and began duties on the Atlantic Barrier, a part of the North American Defense Command. Operating out of Newport, she completed 12 radar picket assignments in the 18 months, breaking the routine duty with a visit to Belgium and the United Kingdom in August 1958. In July 1959, Thomas J. Gary entered Boston Navy Yard for an overhaul. She remained there until 30 October when she got underway for refresher training in waters off the coast of Cuba. On 20 December, she resumed her former duties in the Atlantic alternating North Atlantic Barrier and Contiguous Radar Coverage System assignments. Early in 1961, she varied radar picket duties with participation in Operation \\"Springboard\\"; and, in May, she steamed off Bermuda participating in Operation \\"Lantbex\\". In August, she completed a DEW Line assignment in the northeast Atlantic with a visit to Scotland and finished out the year in overhaul at Boston. Thomas J. Gary next set her course of Guantanamo Bay for refresher training; then, on 10 July 1962, she steamed from Newport for now familiar North Atlantic picket deployment. Between picket assignments, she put in at Greenock and at Wilhelmshaven for well-earned recreation for all hands. Shortly after her return to Newport on 22 October, she was called upon to conduct patrols in support of the Cuban Quarantine. Relieved of her patrol station off Key West on 29 November, she returned to Newport for availability and a welcome holiday in homeport. She filled the opening months of 1963 with radar picket duty out of Key West as Southern Tip Picket, and two tours as Sonar School Ship at Key West. In April, a period of tender availability was cut short for Thomas J. Gary when she was called upon to take part in the unproductive search for the submarine lost off the Atlantic coast. She resumed Southern Tip Picket duties in July, and she returned to Newport late in August. On 24 September, she arrived at Boston for the overhaul and trials, which occupied the remainder of the year. She opened 1964 with operations in the Caribbean including refresher training and participation in Operation \\"Springboard\\". She spent March undergoing availability at Newport and, during April and May, patrolled on picket station off Florida, with time out in May for a good will visit to Fall River, Massachusetts, on Armed Forces Day. She continued picket duties for the rest of the year breaking her routine with gunnery exercises off the Virginia Capes and a visit to the Naval Academy in October. Trip to New Zealand, and Return to the Mediterranean After participating in the annual exercise Operation \\"Springboard\\" again in 1965, she resumed picket duties and, on 30 June, phased out the Southern Tip Picket Station where she had spent so much of her post-World War II career. On 13 September, she departed Newport for a nine-month deployment in the Pacific which took her through the Panama Canal later that month and included support for Operation \\"Deep Freeze,\\" a scientific expedition to the Antarctic. In March 1966, she departed New Zealand and steamed, via the Suez Canal, to the Mediterranean. Her ports of call in there and in the eastern Atlantic included Barcelona, Bremen, Copenhagen, and Edinburgh. She returned to Newport on 21 May 1966. Thomas J. Gary again got underway from Newport on 24 August and set her course, via the Panama Canal and Pago Pago to Dunedin, New Zealand, her replenishment port during her participation in Operation \\"\\"Deep Freeze\\". Manning her station midway between McMurdo Sound and New Zealand, Thomas J. Gary acted as logistics headquarters for Operation \\"Deepfreeze\\" and stood ready to provide search and rescue for downed fliers. She remained in southern waters through the end of 1966. In March, she called at Perth, Australia; then she set her course on 23 March for the Suez Canal. She called at European ports and returned to Newport on 24 May. On 1 July, her home port was officially changed to Key West. After her arrival there on 9 July, she helped to test experimental equipment during Operation \\"Combat Keel\\" late in the year. On 12 December, she returned to Key West for a period of upkeep. In 1968, she operated out of Key West; conducted refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay; and, in August, participated in support operation for the practice firing of Polaris missiles by nuclear submarine . Later in the year, she conducted special operations in the Bahamas and acted as school ship for the Fleet Sonar School at Key West. She continued operations in the Caribbean Sea and off Florida into 1969. During that period her duties included patrolling off of Cuba's south coast, as an intelligence gathering ship, monitoring the Russian presence there. In July, she began a special four-month deployment during which she conducted intelligence support activities for antisubmarine forces in the Atlantic and earned a Navy Unit Commendation. She visited the Canary Islands and Malta before returning to Key West late in October. After participating in Operation \\"Springboard\\" off Puerto Rico early in 1970, she got underway on 1 April and steamed across the Atlantic for operations which took her to Spain, Denmark, Germany, and the British Isles. On this deployment, she helped to develop new techniques and tactics in antisubmarine warfare in such an exemplary manner that she was awarded another Navy Unit Commendation. She returned to Key West on 7 September and operated out of that port into 1972 providing surveillance in support of the Atlantic Fleet. Departing Key West on 14 January 1972, she visited Wilhelmshaven; then returned via Senegal to the United States. Back in Key West in March, she resumed local operations out of that port which she continued well into 1973. Transfer to Tunisia In September 1973, she began preparations for transfer to the Tunisian government. That month, 33 members of a Tunisian turnover team came on board for training. On 12 October, she got underway from Charleston and crossed the Atlantic, stopping briefly at Ponta Delgada and Palma de Mallorca before arriving at Bizerte on 21 October. The next day, Thomas J. Gary was decommissioned in ceremonies at the Quai d'Honneur, Bizerte; and moments later, the ship was commissioned by the Tunisian Navy as the President Bourgiba. Her name was struck from the Navy list that same day. She suffered a major fire on 16 April 1992 and is no longer operational.

As a student company, its purpose was to provide performance opportunities for students of the school. Over several years, both the school and the company grew in reputation and stature in its metamorphosis as Carolina Ballet Theatre, a pre- professional regional company under Ms. Vorus and her successor as Artistic Director, Mary LeGere. Performances of the company began to attract favorable notice from area dance critics. In the fall of 1993, Raleigh lawyer Ward Purrington suggested to Ms. Vorus and the Raleigh Dance Theatre board that the company aspire to professional status. Market research suggested a professional dance presence in the Triangle region was not only needed but desired as well.

It was developed by Japanese organizational theorist Kenichi Ohmae. The 3Cs model points out that a strategist should focus on three key factors for success. In the construction of a business strategy, three main elements must be taken into account: # The Company # The Customers # The Competitors Only by integrating these three, a sustained competitive advantage can exist. Ohmae refers to these key factors as the three Cs or strategic triangle. Customers have wants and needs. The company recognises these and offers a basic product. To cater to their expectations and also to differentiate from competitors, companies try to offer differentiated products. Similarly, competitors attempt to offer differentiated products to generate profits and growth. There is also a new 3 Cs model emerging which centers on sustainability. This model is: #Capability #Consistency #Cultivation The idea behind the new 3 Cs model revolves around the concept of shared value to the company, the environment, and the community. The Customer Clients are the base of any strategy according to Ohmae. Therefore, the primary goal is supposed to be the interest of the customer and not those of the shareholders for example. In the long run, a company that is genuinely interested in its customers will be interesting for its investors and take care of their interests automatically. Segmentation is helping to understand the customer. Segmenting by objectives The differentiation is done in terms of the different ways that various customers use a product. Customer thinking is not one of the prime functions for consideration. Segmenting by customer coverage This segmentation normally emerges from a trade-off study of marketing costs versus market coverage. There appears always to be a point of diminishing returns in the cost versus coverage relationship. The corporation’s task is to optimize its range of market coverage, geographically and/ or channel wise. Segmenting the market once more In fierce competition, competitors are likely to be dissecting the market in similar ways. Over an extended period of time, the effectiveness of a given initial strategic segmentation will tend to decline. In such situations it is useful to pick a small group of customers and reexamine what it is that they are really looking for. A market segment change occurs where the market forces are altering the distribution of the user-mix over time by influencing demography, distribution channels, customer size, etc. This kind of change means that the allocation of corporate resources must be shifted and/ or the absolute level of resources committed in the business must be changed. The Competitors Competitor based strategies can be constructed by looking at possible sources of differentiation in functions such as: purchasing, design, engineering, sales and servicing. The following aspects show ways in order to achieve this differentiation: Making it big in the industryHito-Kane-Mono A favorite phrase of Japanese business planners is hito-kane-mono, standing for people, money and things. They believe that streamlined corporate management is achieved when these three critical resources are in balance without surplus or waste. For example: Cash over and beyond what competent people can intelligently expend is wasted. Of the three critical resources, funds should be allocated last. The corporation should firstly allocate management talent, based on the available mono (things): plant, machinery, technology, process know-how and functional strength. Once these hito (people) have developed creative and imaginative ideas to capture the business’s upward potential, the kane (money) should be given to the specific ideas and programs generated by the individual managers.  The Corporation (The industry)=Selectivity and sequencing The corporation does not have to excel in every function to win. If it can gain a decisive edge in one key function, it will eventually be able to improve its other functions which are now average. Make or buy In case of rapidly rising wage costs, it becomes a critical decision for a company to subcontract a major share of its assembly operations. If its competitors are unable to shift production so rapidly to subcontractors and vendors, the resulting difference in cost structure and/ or in the company's ability to cope with demand fluctuations may have significant strategic implications. In essence, the company should seek to stay ahead of competition by either outsourcing some of its activities that are quite costly but do not have direct value addition or it should apply backward integration techniques for its core business areas.

Lean Construction is concerned with the alignment and holistic pursuit of concurrent and continuous improvements in all dimensions of the built and natural environment: design, construction, activation, maintenance, salvaging, and recycling (Abdelhamid 2007, Abdelhamid et al. 2008). This approach tries to manage and improve construction processes with minimum cost and maximum value by considering customer needs (Koskela et al. 2002), while it helps to achieve and maintain sustainability objectives in all three dimensions of planet, people and profit across the entire construction supply chain (Solaimani & Sedighi, 2019Solaimani, S., & Sedighi, M. (2019). Toward a holistic view on Lean sustainable construction: a literature review. Journal of Cleaner Production, DOI: 10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119213). Historical development Lauri Koskela, in 1992, challenged the construction management community to consider the inadequacies of the time-cost-quality tradeoff paradigm.Koskela-TR72 Another paradigm-breaking anomaly was that observed by Ballard (1994), Ballard and Howell (1994a and 1994b), and Howell (1998). Analysis of project plan failures indicated that \\"normally only about 50% of the tasks on weekly work plans are completed by the end of the plan week\\" and that constructors could mitigate most of the problems through \\"active management of variability, starting with the structuring of the project (temporary production system) and continuing through its operation and improvement\\" (Ballard and Howell 2003). Evidence from research and observations indicated that the conceptual models of Construction Management and the tools it utilizes (work breakdown structure, critical path method, and earned value management) fail to deliver projects 'on-time, at budget, and at desired quality' (Abdelhamid 2004). With recurring negative experiences on projects, evidenced by endemic quality problems and rising litigation, it became evident that the governing principles of construction management needed revisiting. One comment published by the CMAA, in its Sixth Annual Survey of Owners (2006), pointed to concern about work methods and the cost of waste: > \\"While the cost of steel and cement are making headlines, the less > publicized failures in the management of construction projects can be > disastrous. Listen carefully to the message in this comment. We are not > talking about just materials, methods, equipment, or contract documents. We > are talking about how we work to deliver successful capital projects and how > we manage the costs of inefficiency.\\" A new paradigm Koskela (2000) argued that the mismatch between the conceptual models and observed reality underscored the lack of robustness in the existing constructs and signaled the need for a theory of production in construction. Koskela then used the ideal production system embodied in the Toyota Production System to develop a more overarching production management paradigm for project-based production systems where production is conceptualized in three complementary ways, namely, as a Transformation (T), as a Flow (F), and as Value generation (V). : Transformation is the production of inputs into outputs. : Flow can be defined as \\"Movement that is smooth and uninterrupted, as in the 'flow of work from one crew to the next' or the flow of value at the Pull of the customer.\\" : Value is \\"What the Customer is actually paying for the project to produce and install.\\" Koskela and Howell (2002) also presented a review of existing management theory – specifically as related to the planning, execution, and control paradigms – in project-based production systems. Both conceptualizations provide a solid intellectual foundation of lean construction as evident from both research and practice (Abdelhamid 2004). Recognizing that construction sites reflect prototypical behavior of complex and chaotic systems, especially in the flow of both material and information on and off site, Bertelsen (2003a and 2003b) suggested that construction should be modeled using chaos and complex systems theory. Bertelsen (2003b) specifically argued that construction could and should be understood in three complementary ways: * As a project-based production process * As an industry that provides autonomous agents * As a social system What is Lean Construction? The term lean construction was coined by the International Group for Lean Construction in its first meeting in 1993 (Gleeson et al. 2007). Greg Howell and Glenn Ballard (founders of the Lean Construction Institute in 1997) both maintain that Construction in Lean Construction refers to the entire industry and not the phase during which construction takes place. Thus, Lean Construction is for owners, architects, designers, engineers, constructors, suppliers & end users. In any case, the term Lean Construction has escaped canonical definition. There has been a number of reasons for that. The body of knowledge has been in a state of development since 1990. Nonetheless, a definition is needed to be able to operationalize the concepts and principles contained in the philosophy. It is insightful to study the change of definition over time as that represents the evolution and advancement in the state of knowledge about Lean Construction. The reference to Lean Construction as a proper noun is not an attempt to falsely distinguish it from other areas that focus on construction project management. It is a proper noun because it refers to a very specific set of concepts, principles, and practices that are distinct from conventional design and construction management practices . A number of groups have proposed definitions: The International Group for Lean Construction; The Lean Construction Institute; The Associated General Contractors of America; Construction Management Association of America, and others. Researchers have also put forward definitions as foundation for their work and to invite others to add, modify and critique. A sampling is provided here. Lean Construction is a “way to design production systems to minimize waste of materials, time, and effort in order to generate the maximum possible amount of value,\\" (Koskela et al. 2002). Designing a production system to achieve the stated ends is only possible through the collaboration of all project participants (Owner, A/E, contractors, Facility Managers, End-user) at early stages of the project. This goes beyond the contractual arrangement of design/build or constructability reviews where contractors, and sometime facility managers, merely react to designs instead of informing and influencing the design (Abdelhamid et al. 2008). Lean Construction recognizes that desired ends affect the means to achieve these ends, and that available means will affect realized ends (Lichtig 2004). Essentially, Lean Construction aims to embody the benefits of the Master Builder concept (Abdelhamid et al. 2008). \\"One can think of lean construction in a way similar to mesoeconomics. Lean construction draws upon the principles of project-level management and upon the principles that govern production-level management. Lean construction recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and production management.\\" (Abdelhamid 2007) Lean construction supplements traditional construction management approaches with (Abdelhamid 2007): (1) two critical and necessary dimensions for successful capital project delivery by requiring the deliberate consideration of material and information flow and value generation in a production system; and (2) different project and production management (planning-execution-control) paradigms. While lean construction is identical to lean production in spirit, it is different in how it was conceived as well as how it is practiced. There is a view that \\"adaptation\\" of Lean Manufacturing/Production forms the basis of Lean Construction. The view of Lauri Koskela, Greg Howell, and Glenn Ballard is very different, with the origin of lean construction arising mainly from the need for a production theory in construction and anomalies that were observed in the reliability of weekly production planning. Getting work to flow reliably and predictably on a construction site requires the impeccable alignment of the entire supply chain responsible for constructed facilities such that value is maximized and waste is minimized. With such a broad scope, it is fair to say that tools found in Lean Manufacturing and Lean Production, as practiced by Toyota and others, have been adapted to be used in the fulfillment of Lean construction principles. TQM, SPC, six-sigma, have all found their way into lean construction. Similarly, tools and methods found in other areas, such as in social science and business, are used where they are applicable. The tools and methods in construction management, such as CPM and work breakdown structure, etc., are also utilized in lean construction implementations. The three unique tools and methods that were specifically conceived for lean construction are the Last Planner System, Target Value Design, and the Lean Project Delivery System. If the tool, method, and/or technique will assist in fulfilling the aims of lean construction, it is considered a part of the toolkit available for use. A sampling of these tools includes: BIM (Lean Design), A3, process design (Lean Design), offsite fabrication and JIT (Lean Supply), value chain mapping (Lean Assembly), visual site (Lean Assembly); 5S (Lean Assembly), daily crew huddles (Lean Assembly). The priority for all construction work is to: # Keep work flowing so that the crews are always productive installing product # Reduce inventory of material and tools and # Reduce costs While lean construction’s main tool for making design and construction processes more predictable is the Last Planner System (see below) and derivatives of it, other lean tools already proven in manufacturing have been adapted to the construction industry with equal success. These include: 5S, Kanban, Kaizen events, quick setup/changeover, Poka Yoke, visual control and 5 Whys (Mastroianni and Abdelhamid 2003, Salem et al. 2005). Early involvement of contractors and suppliers The early involvement of contractors and suppliers is seen as a key differentiator for construction so called 'best practice'. While there are Trade Marked business processes (see below), academics have also addressed related concepts such as 'early contractor involvement' (ECI). Integrated Project Delivery Primary IPD team members include the owner, architect, key technical consultants, general contractor and key subcontractors. Using IPD, project participants can overcome key organizational and contractual problems. The IPD approach to contracting aligns project objectives with the interests of key participants. IPD relies on participant selection, transparency and continuing dialog. Construction consumers might consider rethinking their contracting strategies to share more fully in the benefits. The IPD approach creates an organization with the ability to apply Lean Project Delivery (LPD) principles and practices. (Matthews and Howell 2005) Commercial arrangements that support IPD and Lean Project Delivery There are at least five principal forms of contract that support lean construction * In America, IFoA uses explicit lean construction principles. Sutter Health in Sacramento developed 'Integrated Form of Agreement for Lean Project Delivery' for use on healthcare projects in and around California. * ConsensusDocs300 is a derivative of IFoA. ConsensusDocs offers contracts on Tri-Party Agreement for Integrated Project Delivery, Building Information Modeling (BIM) Addendum, and Green Building Addendum projects. * \\"AIA Document C191™–2009 is a standard form multi-party agreement through which the owner, architect, contractor [etc] execute a single agreement for the design, construction and commissioning of a project.\\" The American Institute of Architects (AIA) provides a list of Integrated Project Delivery system distributors. * In the UK, PPC2000 is publicized by the Association of Consultant Architects. * In Australia, the Lean Construction Institute has collaborated with the Alliancing Association of Australasia (AAA) around the topics of alliancing agreements and collaborative contracts. Other papers explain Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) and IFoA. PPC2000, IFoA and 'alliancing agreements' were among the topics discussed at the 'Lean in the Public Sector' (LIPS) conference held in 2009.'Lean in the Public Sector' (LIPS) Proceedings Integrated Lean Project Delivery (ILPD) Integrated Lean Project Delivery (ILPD) is a process trademarked by The Boldt Group. It was created and is practiced by The Boldt Group's subsidiary, The Boldt Company. The process aims to eliminate waste across the construction value chain, through evaluation of initial planning and design, and examination of construction processes to predict where and when waste will occur, which is then eliminated through the use of lean tools in the IPD process. An ILPD contract is a multi-party agreement that specifies the use of lean practices as conceived in the Lean Project Delivery System. This distinction is needed because Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is now only referring to the multi-party agreement regardless of what practices are used, the so-called IPD-lite or IPD-ish. Practical applications of lean construction In the UK, a major R&D; project, Building Down Barriers, was launched in 1997 to adapt the Toyota Production System for use in the construction sector. The resulting supply chain management toolset was tested and refined on two pilot projects and the comprehensive and detailed process- based toolset was published in 2000 as the 'Building Down Barriers Handbook of Supply Chain Management-The Essentials'. The project demonstrated very clearly that lean thinking would only deliver major performance improvements if the construction sector learned from the extensive experience of other business sectors. Lean thinking must become the way that all the firms in the design and construction supply chain co-operate with each other at a strategic level that over-arches individual projects. In the aerospace sector, these long-term supply-side relationships are called a 'Virtual Company', in other business sectors they are called an 'Extended Lean Enterprise'. The UK 'Building Down Barriers Handbook of Supply Chain Management-The Essentials' states that: 'The commercial core of supply chain management is setting up long-term relationships based on improving the value of what the supply chain delivers, improving quality and reducing underlying costs through taking out waste and inefficiency. This is the opposite of 'business as usual' in the construction sector, where people do things on project after project in the same old inefficient ways, forcing each other to give up profits and overhead recovery in order to deliver at what seems the market price. What results is a fight over who keeps any of the meagre margins that result from each project, or attempts to recoup 'negative margins' through 'claims', The last thing that receives time or energy in this desperate, project-by-project gladiatorial battle for survival is consideration of how to reduce underlying costs or improve quality'. Last Planner System The Last Planner System, as developed by the Lean Construction Institute, is: > The collaborative, commitment-based planning system that integrates should- > can-will-did planning (pull planning, make-ready, look-ahead planning) with > constraint analysis, weekly work planning based upon reliable promises, and > learning based upon analysis of PPC (plan percent complete) and reasons for > variance.Glossary Lean Construction Institute Users such as owners, clients or construction companies, can use LPS to achieve better performance in design and construction through increased schedule/programme predictability (i.e. work is completed as and when promised). LPS is a system of inter-related elements, and full benefits come when all are implemented together. It is based on simple paper forms, so it can be administered using Post-it notes, paper, pencil, eraser and photocopier. A spreadsheet can help. LPS begins with collaborative scheduling/programming engaging the main project suppliers from the start. Risk analysis ensures that float is built in where it will best protect programme integrity and predictability. Where appropriate the process can be used for programme compression too. In this way, one constructor took 6 weeks out of an 18-week programme for the construction of a 40 bed hotel. Benefits to the client are enormous. Image:Intense discussion during a programme compression workshop.jpg Figure 1: intense discussion during a programme compression workshop Before work starts, team leaders make tasks ready so that when work should be done, it can be. Why put work into production if a pre-requisite is missing? This MakeReady process continues throughout the project. Image:Part of MakeReady form.jpg Figure 2: part of a MakeReady form for documenting the process of making tasks ready (this one for use in design) There is a weekly work planning (WWP) meeting involving all the last planners – design team leaders and/or trade supervisors on site. It is in everyone’s interest to explore inter- dependencies between tasks and prevent colleagues from over-committing. Image:Part of a Weekly Work Plan form.png Figure 3: part of a Weekly Work Plan form used by trade foremen on site or design team leaders to prepare for the WWP meeting. This weekly work planning processes is built around promises. The agreed programme defines when tasks should be done and acts as a request to the supplier to do that task. The last planners (that is the trade foremen on site or design team leaders in a design process) only promise once they have clarified the conditions of satisfaction and are clear that the task can be done. Image:The promise cycle.jpg Figure 4: the promise cycle (after Fernando Flores) Once the task is complete the last planner responsible declares completion so that site management or the next trade can assure themselves that it is complete to an appropriate standard. A key measure of the success of the Last Planner system is PPC. This measures the Percentage of Promises Completed on time. As PPC increases. project productivity and profitability increase, with step changes at around 70% and 85%. This score is measured site-wide and displayed around the site. Weekly measures are used by the project and by individual suppliers as the basis for learning how to improve the predictability of the work programme and hence the PPC scores. A key part of the continual improvement process is a study of the reasons why tasks promised in the WWP are delivered late. The following chart shows typical reasons: Image:Example of a reasons Pareto chart.jpg Figure 5: example of a reasons Pareto chart Recording the reasons in a Pareto chart like the one above makes it easy to see where attention is most likely to yield the most results. Using tools like 5 Why analysis and cause-effect diagrams will help the team understand how they can improve the clarity of information and ensure that there are sufficient operatives. Last Planner benefits don’t stop at project predictability, profit and productivity; it contributes to positive changes in other industry KPIs. Danish research shows almost half the accidents and up to 70% less sickness absence on LPS managed sites. LCI retains a registered Trademark on the term and Copyright in the idea and materials to prevent people who misunderstand or misrepresent the system from using it in trade. Consulting companies or individuals wishing to use the Last Planner System in trade (commercial offering of service) must first be approved by LCI. Consultants are expected to make financial and other contributions to LCI in recognition of the work and effort LCI put into developing Last Planner. Last Planner System development continues under the direction of Lean Construction Institute Directors Professor Glenn Ballard and Greg Howell with support from users around the world. For more information about the development process see Ballard (1994, 2000) and Ballard and Howell (2004) for example. For a detailed description and list of the benefits of LPS, see Mossman: Last Planner®: 5 + 1 crucial & collaborative conversations for predictable design & construction deliveryMossman-Last-Planner.pdf and for additional references see the Designing Buildings wiki.http://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/The_Last_Planner_System Differences between LC and project management approaches There are many differences between the Lean Construction (LC) approach and the Project Management Institute (PMI) approach to construction. These include: *Managing the interaction between activities and combined effects of dependence and variation, is a first concern in lean construction because their interactions highly affects the time and cost of projects (Howell, 1999); in comparison, these interactions are not considered in PMI. *In lean construction, optimization efforts focus on making work flow reliable (Ballard, LPDS, 2000); in contrast PMI focuses on improving productivity of each activity which can make errors and reducing quality and result in rework. *The project is structured and managed as a value generating process (value is defined as satisfying customer requirements); while PMI considers less cost as value. *In the lean approach, downstream stakeholders are involved in front end planning and design through cross functional teams (Ballard, LPDS, 2000). PMI doesn’t consider this issue. *In lean construction, project control has the job of execution (Ballard, PhD thesis, 2000); whereas, control in PMI method relies on variance detection after-the-fact. *In the lean approach, pull techniques govern the flow of information and materials, from upstream to downstream; with PMI, push techniques govern the release of information and materials. *Capacity and inventory are adjusted to absorb variation (Mura). Feedback loops, included at every level, help ensure minimal inventories and rapid system response; in comparison, PMI doesn’t consider adjustments. *Lean construction tries to mitigate variation in every aspect (product quality, rate of work) and manage the remaining variation, while PMI doesn’t consider variation mitigation and management. *Lean approach tries to make continuous improvements in the process, workflows and product; whereas PMI approach doesn’t pay that much attention to continuous improvement. *In lean construction, decision making is distributed in design production control systems; by comparison, in PMI decision making is centered to one manager some times. *Lean construction tries to increase transparency between the stakeholders, managers and labourers, in order to know the impact of their work on the whole project; on the other hand, PMI doesn’t consider transparency in its methods. *In lean construction a buffer of sound assignments is maintained for each crew or production unit; in contrast, PMI method doesn’t consider a backlog for crews. *Lean construction is developing new forms of commercial contracts to give incentives to suppliers for reliable work flow and optimization at the deliverable-to-the-client level; while PMI doesn’t have such policy. *Lean construction production system design resists the tendency toward local suboptimization, however, PMI persists on optimizing each activity. *The PMI-driven approach only considers managing a project at the macro-level. This is necessary but not sufficient for the success of projects. Lean Construction encompasses Project and Production Management, and formally recognizes that any successful project undertaking will inevitably involve the interaction between project and production management.

Former anchors included D. H. Holmes Macy's (the first Macy's in Louisiana) And Mervyn's . The mall opened in 1983 and was owned by the Simon Property Group, who acquired it through their merger with Mills Corporation in 2007. It is now managed by Pacific Management Group. The mall serves people throughout Kenner and surrounding areas. History The mall was built and opened in 1985. The original owners were Cadillac Fairview. The Mills bought it in 2003 and planned to add new retail including two new anchors (Target and Bass Pro Shops), as well as a new movie theater, but the plan fell through as the Mills faced financial difficulties. Dillard's acquired the former D. H. Holmes in 1985, and opened a men's store in the mall after Godchaux's closed as an anchor in 1989. The mall closed in August 2005 after sustaining damage from Hurricane Katrina, reopening by October 2005. Macy's closed its store in the Esplanade,Macy's revises plans to reopen at Esplanade in N.O.  New Orleans CityBusiness  Find Articles at BNET.com but re-opened in October 2008.New Orleans CityBusiness - The Business Newspaper of Metropolitan New Orleans Mervyn's closed at the mall in 2006 and sat vacant until 2010.

Their ranges and stand-alone ovens were known for their patented insulation methods, which enabled them to cook on retained heat with the fuel turned off.  History  The Chambers Fireless Gas Range was a gas cook stove created by John E. Chambers in 1910, Two years after inventing his fireless cooker, John Chambers organized the Chambers Company in 1912. Chambers' patented method of manufactureU.S. Patent # 1,469,890 - 10/9/1923 used thick rock wool insulation to insulate the oven on all sides. This made it possible for the heat inside the oven to build up over a short period of time. The gas was then turned off, causing a series of internal dampers to close, which effectively isolated the oven compartment from the outside air. The food would continue to cook on retained heat, thus conserving fuel and reducing food shrinkage. This method of cooking, Chambers literature often claimed, also increased the food value of the cooked items. Chambers Fireless Model from 1920sThe Chambers Corporation manufactured successive versions of this design in Shelbyville, Indiana, from 1912 through January, 1955. Chambers Corporation was sold by the Chambers family in 1950 to the Flato brothers, who were the Chambers distributors in Houston, Texas. The Rangaire company purchased Chambers in 1964, and operated it out of the Oxford, Mississippi, plant built by the Flato brothers in 1963 until 1983, when they sold it to the KitchenAid Division of the Hobart Corporation. Pp. 56. During Rangaire's ownership of the Chambers Corporation, manufacture of the famous insulated range continued into the 1970s. In 1986, KitchenAid was sold to Whirlpool.\\"KitchenAid.\\" International Directory of Company Histories. The Gale Group, Inc, 2006. Answers.com 25 Apr. 2007. http://www.answers.com/topic/kitchenaid-4396712 By the early 1990s, Chambers-branded appliances were no longer being manufactured. In 2007, the Thor Corporation of Los Angeles resurrected the Chambers brand name.Chambers brand introduced The earliest Chambers ranges were small, but all were constructed of heavy gauge steel and porcelain enamel. All models were thickly insulated, which enabled their owners to use them like an ordinary range or cook using retained heat. To help owners of their products learn the proper use of the retained heat cooking feature of their ranges, Chambers developed a large home economics department in their Shelbyville, Indiana, factory. There, recipes and cooking times using the insulated properties of their products were carefully tested and perfected. These tests resulted in charts which indicated the amount of time - and at what temperature - the gas was to be burned in the oven and the ThermodomeU.S. Patent #1,469,890, 10/9/1923 (which was succeeded by the Thermowell), before it was to be turned off completely while the food continued to cook on retained heat.Chambers Corp.: \\"Time, Temperature, and Retained Heat Chart\\", various models, originally printed in 1939. By 1927, Chambers published a cookbook for the homemaker to not only help her learn how to care for and operate the appliance, but also to assist her in menu planning, proper table setting, etc. This publication was called The Idle Hour Cookbook. The Idle Hour Cookbook was replaced in the late 1960s by Rangaire with an actual operation manual.Chambers Corp., div. of Rangaire Corp: \\"Chambers Owners Guide\\", 1965, 1970. Chambers promoted the ranges using traveling cooking shows. John Chambers' daughter Alma Chambers, traveled coast-to-coast for over twenty years conducting large cooking shows to promote the Chambers Range. Vintage Chambers stove Improvements over the original design were continuously developed over the years, but all were constructed around the concept of a heavily insulated oven, as originally designed by John Chambers. The most updated version of these was the C-series,U.S. Patent #2,614,620 - Improved top burner for C series ranges. 10/21/1952U.S. Patents #2,672,137; #2,755,791 - Back flue for Models C41/61 and C90, respectively. 3/16/1954 and 4/24/1956, respectively.U.S. Patent #2,763,259 - Removable base trim. 9/18/1956 which was produced from 1949–1963, succeeding the B-series (1939–1949). Chambers also built large, industrial-sized units, called the Imperial line, for use in hotels, restaurants, dormitory kitchens, tea rooms, road houses, large homes, etc.Chambers Corp.: \\"Cook With The Gas Turned Off\\", pages 14-15, 1936. All residential Chambers ranges beginning with what is now referred to as the A-series (circa 1934) had a top-mounted griddle/broiler.U.S. Patent #2,011,848 Some models came with a recessed ThermoWell (descendant of the earlier ThermoDome) for cooking soups, stews, etc., using special aluminum kettles designed and built for Chambers by the Wearever Corporation. In 2015, the Chambers brand was purchased by J.A.K. North America Inc. in Canada, and licensed by J.A.K. North America Inc. in the U.S. They have revived Chambers' retro appliance lineup and updated it with modern technology for energy efficiency and performance.  Features  While not all models had all the following features, most of the more commonly sold Chambers ranges included: *Automatic Oven Safety Systems - to shut off the oven gas should the pilot light go out. *Basket-style oven racks. *Built-in Lamps. *Child-protective locking thumb-latches on all gas valves.U.S. Patent #2,134,029 - 10/25/1938 *Chrome-Plated cooktop, which Chambers called \\"Duracrome\\". *Full porcelain finishes - guaranteed by the factory for 25 years. *Heat from Range vented out through the backsplash, enabling it to be set flush to the wall *Mechanical Timer, which Chambers called a \\"Minute Minder\\".Chambers Corp.: \\"Cook With The Gas Turned Off\\", pages 2, 4, 6, 10 - 1936. *Multi-fuel design - able to operate on natural gas, propane, butane. *Patented \\"daisy\\" burners - efficient and uniform in their distribution of heat.U.S. Patents #1,959,657; #2,180,862; #2,614,620; #2,162,374 *Some of the first built-in ovens and cooktops (early 1950s) made in America. *Teardrop design gas handles. *The use of \\"ThermalEye\\" (1950s) - developed by Robertshaw and marketed by Chambers as \\"The Burner With A Brain\\", this device made it possible to set the desired cooking temperature of a pot that had been placed on the special burner on the top of the range, and the heat would be regulated automatically.Robertshaw-Fulton Controls Company, Youngwood, Pennsylvania: \\"Thermal Eye Top Burner Control Instructions and Cooking Suggestions\\", 1954, 1960. *Thermobaker insert for the Thermowell - enabled baking of small items and meals in the Thermowell.Chambers Corp.: \\"Here's The New ThermoOven\\", 1950; \\"Accessories For Your Chambers Range\\", page 3, 1952. *Top Burner Pilot - could be used as a warming burner. *Utility (Service) Cabinet - designed for access to the inner mechanisms and gas pipes of the range, and for storage of pots, pans, and Thermowell kettles.

Demand for refurbished Chambers stoves remains high - some of the Imperial models have been restored and sold for prices up to US$17,000, though selling prices of unrestored residential models is far less. Increased interest in the Chambers Range may be due to its exposure on the televised cooking show of Rachael Ray. Websites for fans of vintage Chambers products have been developed in order to provide general information about them to those on the internet. Links to service technicians, sources for parts, as well as operational literature may also be found there. Also helpful are the pictorial documentaries on the restoration of Chambers ranges by their owners. In addition to websites such as these, at least two active Internet Forums exist for those interested in older Chambers products. There, people can find recipes, repair tips, cooking techniques, and restoration advice.

Plot introduction  Marty Bowman was an L.A. lifeguard who thought he might like to play detective. At a posh house party in the central California mountains he got his chance to play— for keeps.  Plot summary  Kate Weston is worried about her friend Sandy Engle. Since her marriage to George Engle, the vivacious Sandy has practically become a recluse. Kate's suspicion that something is wrong leads her to hire what she thinks is a detective to pose as her boyfriend during a weekend house party at the Engle's estate high in the central California mountains. Instead of a detective, though—because of a manpower shortage at the Gregory Agency—Kate gets a stand-in: Marty Bowman, an L.A. lifeguard with vague ambitions of following in his brother's private-eye footsteps. The guests at the party seem to have little in common until George Engle turns up dead at the bottom of his swimming pool with Marty Bowman's lucky silver dollar clenched in his fist. The murder investigation by slow- moving local sheriff Frank Toland finds the thread that connects most of the guests: they were being blackmailed by George. Marty becomes the prime suspect in the murder and to save his own neck has to stay one step ahead of Toland. As he subtly conducts an independent investigation under Toland's nose, Marty discovers that in addition to blackmailing his house party guests—and many others—George has conned his wife into believing she has tuberculosis. Slipping past the guard of sheriff Toland's rookie assistant, Marty and Sandy pay an after-hours visit to a clinic in the valley, where Marty, with the help of an X-ray technician, proves to Sandy that her ill health is an illusion. After bar-hopping with a jubilant Sandy for the rest of the evening, Marty resists her drunken advances (and beds Kate instead). The next morning, however, Marty finds that Sandy too has been murdered. Unbeknownst to the sheriff, Sandy had retained possession of some of the evidence her husband had used to blackmail their guests, a fact that led George's murderer to kill once more. The murderer, sensing that Marty is closing in on the truth, sets for him the same underwater death trap used on George. Fortunately, Marty's familiarity with swimming pool hydraulics enables him to anticipate the trap, foil it, and turn the tables on the killer. A struggle ensues, followed by the climactic denouement.

It is an affiliate through the Smithsonian Affiliations program. The museum is a part of the Division of State History Museums, Office of Archives and History, an agency of the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources.  History  Frederick Augustus Olds, known as the \\"father\\" of the North Carolina Museum of History, began collecting items from across North Carolina in the late 19th century. He eventually traversed all 100 counties, at least once, and acquired not only pieces of the past but also the stories associated with them—starting a philosophy that exists to this day at the museum: using stories to relate the past of North Carolina. On December 5, 1902, Olds merged his large private collection with the collection owned and displayed in a room of the State Museum (which has evolved into the modern-day North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences). The assortment of historical artifacts became known as the \\"Hall of History\\" and was opened to the public. The hall's 37 cases contained items as various as a studded shoe buckle owned by James Iredell to the death mask of Confederate General Robert Hoke. (To honor Olds, a metal statue has been erected on the steps of the current Museum of History building to greet visitors; he is joined by a statue of craftsman Thomas Day and a representative Sauratown woman.) The North Carolina Historical Commission took over the Hall of History in 1914 and moved the collection to the Ruffin Building on the southwest corner of Union Square (where the North Carolina State Capitol sits); however, the hall quickly outgrew that space. The hall was then moved, in 1939, to the Education Building, across from the northwest corner of Union Square, where an area was specifically designed to accommodate both artifacts and exhibits. On July 1, 1965, with continued growth of the collection, need for expanded exhibit space, and an increase in staff, the Hall of History was renamed the North Carolina Museum of History and was identified to become a part of the new Archives and History/State Library Building. That move took place in 1968. On June 16, 1988, the State of North Carolina broke ground at 5 East Edenton Street to begin construction of a new, dedicated building for the museum. Located in part of the block between the State Capitol and the Legislative Building, the museum's permanent home was completed in 1994 for more than $29 million.\\"History on the Mall in Raleigh.\\" Cambridge Seven Associates. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Sept. 2013. The new building features a research library, classrooms, a 315-seat auditorium, a design shop, conservation labs, artifact storage space, offices, the Museum Shop, and of exhibit space on four floors.  Tar Heel Junior Historian Association  One of the North Carolina Museum of History's best known outreach programs is the Tar Heel Junior Historian Association (THJHA). THJHA inspires and empowers North Carolina students to discover local and state history—in an active, hands-on way. The association also encourages junior historians to share what they learn, often through projects that are planned and completed by students. Many projects are entered into contests and shared during the THJHA Annual Convention in Raleigh. Award- winning projects often become a part of the association's gallery, History in Every Direction. Authorized by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1953, THJHA is a network of free clubs across the state, with members in grades 4–12 and at least one adult adviser. Clubs may be sponsored by public, private, or home schools, or by other organizations such as museums and historical societies, 4-H and FFA groups, or scouting programs. Clubs can be any size, from one student and one adviser to hundreds of students and several advisers. THJHA staff at the museum provide support and resources that include a semiannual student magazine Tar Heel Junior Historian.  North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame  North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame Gallery The North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame is housed in a permanent exhibit gallery on the third floor of the North Carolina Museum of History. The hall of fame was originally established in February 1963, with support from the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, \\"celebrates excellence and extraordinary achievement in athletics [and] commemorates and memorializes exceptional accomplishments in or connected with the world of sports who have brought recognition and esteem to themselves and to the State of North Carolina.\\" The hall inducted its first class of five members in December of that year and, as of 2010, numbered 274 members. Since the beginning, inductees, who are elected annually, have donated mementos of their sports careers to the hall of fame. In 1969 officials at the Charlotte Coliseum agreed to display these objects in the corridor of the building, hoping to eventually expand the building to include a room dedicated to the hall. The expansion never occurred, however, and in 1981 the objects were moved to the North Carolina Museum of History, where a dedicated gallery was a part of the new museum's plans. Mementos on display in the gallery include Richard Petty's race car, Dale Earnhardt's fire suit, North Carolina State University basketball coach Jim Valvano's warm-up suit, Arnold Palmer's Ryder Cup golf bag, Meadowlark Lemon's Harlem Globetrotters basketball uniform, North Carolina State University coach Kay Yow's Olympic team basketball, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill football star Charlie \\"Choo Choo\\" Justice's jersey.

It is a DAX corporation and is one of the largest building materials companies in the world. On 1 July 2016, HeidelbergCement AG completed the acquisition of a 45% shareholding in Italcementi. That acquisition made HeidelbergCement the number one producer of construction aggregates, the number 2 in cement and number 3 in ready mixed concrete worldwide. The enlarged group has activities in around 60 countries with 57,000 employees working at 3,000 production sites. HeidelbergCement operates 139 cement plants with an annual cement capacity of 176 million tonnes, more than 1,500 ready-mixed concrete production sites, and over 600 aggregates quarries. History HeidelbergCement incl. Italcementi The company was founded on 5 June 1874 by Johann Philipp Schifferdecker, at Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It was making 80,000 tonnes per annum of Portland cement in 1896. It acquired numerous other small companies from 1914 onwards, and by 1936, it was making one million tonnes per annum. Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, the cement industry profited massively from state-run construction and armaments projects, leading to a generally positive view of the policies of the Reich government among workers and management of the company. The company's general director Otto Heuer had joined the NSDAP on May 1 in 1933 and was a member of the Freundeskreis Reichsführer SS. During the Second World War, the cement industry was classified as essential to the war effort and initially experienced only minor restrictions in production. As the war progressed, prisoners of war and forced labourers were used in numerous plants; according to the company, the number of people affected is estimated at 1,000. Activities abroad began with the acquisition of part of Vicat Cement, France. Shipments reached 8.3 million tonnes in 1972. In 1977, a massive program of purchases in North America began with the acquisition of Lehigh Cement. In 1990, expansion in eastern Europe began. In 1993, it acquired part of SA Cimenteries CBR of Belgium, which already had a major multinational operation. Since then it has continued to expand, with complete buy out of CBR, and purchases in eastern Europe and Asia. A major step was the acquisition of Scancem in 1999, with operations in Northern Europe as well as Africa. Indocement in Indonesia was included in 2001. In May 2007, the British company Hanson was acquired, a transaction worth £7.85 billion (US$15.8 billion), which gave the company a stronger market position in the United Kingdom and the United States, and turned HeidelbergCement into the world's leading producer of aggregates. HeidelbergCement plant in Schelklingen, Germany HeidelbergCement has (2010) 29 cement and grinding plants in Western and Northern Europe, 19 in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, 16 cement plants in North America, and 14 in Africa and the Mediterranean Basin. The company sold Maxit Group and its 35% share in Vicat Cement to help finance its acquisition of Hanson plc in August 2007. In most of the group’s European countries, HeidelbergCement is the market leader in the cement business. Adolf Merckle was a big investor in HeidelbergCement.Adolf Merckle on Forbes.com A capital increase in HeidelbergCement in September 2009, combined with a selling of shares from the Merckle family, opened up for other international owners and higher trading volumes on the stock exchanges.

Kunda Nordic Tsement in Estonia is one of the subsidiaries of HeidelbergCement On 1 July 2016, HeidelbergCement AG completed the acquisition of a 45% shareholding in Italcementi S.p.A. With the acquisition, HeidelbergCement becomes the number 1 producer of aggregates, the number 2 in cement and number 3 in ready mixed concrete worldwide. The company agreed to sell its assets in the United States for $660 million to Cementos Argos to fulfil anti trust requirements for the takeover. HeidelbergCement has entered new important markets, such as France and Italy in Europe, Egypt and Morocco in North Africa and Thailand in southeast Asia. In the Canada, India and Kazakhstan, the takeover will further strengthen the existing market presence of HeidelbergCement.

The objective is the exploitation of the Kendeng mountains against the resistance of the people living there. In addition to the destruction of the complex ecological system, the construction also has created the marginalization of partially indigenous living inhabitants of the region to follow. In this region, the indigenous known as Sedulur Kendeng are protesting against the planned mining operation of PT Semen Indonesia, a state owned enterprise. In March 2017, 50 protestors poured concrete over their feet in front of the Presidential Palace in Jakarta. This is the second time this has occurred in eleven months. In addition to the protest against the factory building and its ecological consequences as \\"misconceived \`development\` at the expense of indigenous and peasants\\", the activists also appealed politically at HeidelbergCement that a multinational \\"company should not invest in environmental destruction and human rights violations, in any country in the world.\\" In September 2020, representatives of the local communities submitted a complaint to the German government.https://www.inclusivedevelopment.net/wp- content/uploads/2020/09/Complaint-to-German-NCP-Regarding- HeidelbergCement_9Sept2020_Redacted-for-pub.pdf It alleges HeidelbergCement’s plans in the Kendeng mountains to threaten their livelihoods, water resources and the local ecosystem as well as sites sacred to local Indigenous Samin communities.

As a redshirt freshman, his first reception was a 20-yard touchdown against the University of Maryland. He appeared in 11 games, tallying 9 receptions for 128 yards and 3 touchdowns. As a sophomore, he played in the first 9 games (2 starts), before suffering a broken clavicle against Wake Forest University and missing 2 games. He led the team with 32 receptions for 580 yards and 6 touchdowns. As a junior in 1994, he played in 11 games (4 starts), registering 33 receptions for 560 yards (17 yards avg.) and 3 touchdowns. His best game came against North Carolina State University, where he had 6 receptions for 153 yards, including a 52-yard touchdown. As a senior, he missed 4 games with a hamstring injury, but still led the team with 34 receptions for 517 yards (15.2 yards avg.) and 3 touchdowns. At the time, he finished his college career with 108 receptions (fourth in school history) for 1,785 yards (fourth in school history) and 15 touchdowns. He also holds the school record for the longest streak of games with at least one reception (31). Professional career=Denver Broncos Jeffers was selected by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round (159th overall) of the 1996 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he was used mostly on special teams, appearing in the first three games, before being declared inactive for the next 12 and playing again in the season finale against the San Diego Chargers. The next year, he was the team's fourth wide receiver, appearing in 10 games and being declared inactive in 6. He played primarily on special teams, as part of a team that won Super Bowl XXXII. On August 30, 1998, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for past considerations. Dallas Cowboys In 1998, Jeffers spent the first half of the season learning the Dallas Cowboys offense and playing mainly on the scout team. He appeared in 8 games, finishing with 18 receptions for 330 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also led the team with 7 receptions for 92 yards, in the first-round playoff loss against the Arizona Cardinals. He was declared a restricted free agent at the end of the season and although he was seen as a player on the rise, the Cowboys gambled and tendered him a qualifying offer at his original draft round. The Carolina Panthers signed him to a one-year offer sheet for a $1.2 million base salary, that the Cowboys did not to match. The team received a fifth round pick as compensation, that was eventually used to trade up to select Ebenezer Ekuban. Carolina Panthers Jeffers new contract made him the highest paid wide receiver on the Carolina Panthers roster, but he still had to work his way into the starting lineup. He played in 15 games (10 starts) and had a breakout season, registering 63 receptions for 1,082 yards (17.2 yards avg.) and 12 touchdowns. He finished strong, recording 5 straight 100-yard receiving games (two short of the NFL record). He also set several franchise records: * 17.2 yards per reception average. * 6 consecutive games with a touchdown reception. * 12 touchdown receptions in a season (tied the team record). * 88-yard reception against the Pittsburgh Steelers (second longest in team history) * Teamed with Muhsin Muhammad (1,253 yards) to become the first tandem in Panthers history to each register 1,000 receiving yards in the same season. On August 10, 2000, he was lost for the year after tearing his right anterior cruciate ligament, while playing in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Besides repairing the ligament, he had additional procedures performed in both knees and although he was able to rehabilitate his right knee, the left one deteriorated until needing microfracture surgery. Jeffers returned in 2001 to play 9 games in a reserve role, but was not able to regain his previous form. He was released on August 23, 2002. Personal life His sister is Allison Jeffers Dooley, who is married to Derek Dooley, former head coach at The University of Tennessee. He also has four kids.

History This station originally broadcast from the antenna on the side of the Tower Building in downtown Little Rock as KMMK, also known as \\"K-Rose\\", a classical/easy listening format. In 1973, Bernie Mann/Mann Media, purchased the station,changed the calls to KEZQ and moved the tower out west to Shinall Mountain, and eventually increased the ERP/tower height to cover the entire metro. The station aired the Bonneville \\"Beautiful Music\\" format, and did well. Mann Media sold the station to Multimedia in 1976 along with the other station he owned, KALO-AM 1250 to Ron Curtis, who had purchased Dan Garner's KLAZ, 98.5 FM. Multimedia changed the 94.1 FM call letter and format shortly after closing to KLPQ (KQ-94) and launched a rock format. The market was in an uproar for quite some time, while the beautiful music format was aired in mid-days and evenings on Ted Snider's KARN 920 AM. In 1978, Ed Muniz from New Orleans purchased 100.3 FM in Jacksonville and purchased the \\"intellectual property\\" from Gary Fries/GM of KLPQ-FM, and launched FM-100/KEZQ. KLPQ survived until late 1983 when Philip Jonsson from Dallas purchased the station, and launched KHLT \\"K-Lite\\". In 1994, adult contemporary KHLT made the change to \\"The Point\\", a 70s-based classic hits format, which was an early hybrid of Classic Top-40 and classic rock. The station was assigned the call sign KKPT by the Federal Communications Commission on June 17, 1994.

In Sweden he is equally known for creating the Atterberg grainsize scale, which remains the one in use. Atterberg received his Ph.D. in chemistry from Uppsala University in 1872 and then stayed there as a lecturer in analytical chemistry until 1877, during which time he traveled across Sweden and abroad to study the latest developments in organic chemistry. He then went on to become the principal of the Chemical Station and Seed Control Institute at Kalmar, publishing numerous papers on agricultural research dealing with the classification of varieties of oats and corn between 1891 and 1900. It was towards the age of fifty-four that Atterberg, while continuing his work on chemistry, began to focus his efforts on the classification and plasticity of soils, for which he is most remembered. Atterberg was apparently the first to suggest the limit <0.002 mm as a classification for clay particles. He found that plasticity to be a particular characteristic of clay and as a result of his investigations arrived at the consistency limits which bear his name today. He also conducted studies aiming to identify the specific minerals that give a clayey soil its plastic nature. Atterberg's work on soil classification gained formal recognition from the International Society of Soil Science in a Berlin Conference in 1913. Two year later a U.S. Bureau of Standards report stated that Atterberg's method was \\"as simple a one as could be devised, and...it is well that we should become familiar with it.\\" The U.S. Bureau of Chemistry and Soils adopted it in 1937. The importance of Atterberg's work has never been fully realized in his own field of agricultural science, nor in other subjects concerned with clays, such as ceramics. Its introduction to the field of geotechnical engineering was due to Karl Terzaghi, who came to realise its importance at a relatively early stage of his research. Terzaghi's assistant, Arthur Casagrande, standardized the tests in his paper in 1932 and the procedures have been followed worldwide ever since. He was the uncle of the composer Kurt Atterberg.

He is described by Laderchi as masterless, and of irregular life, always in trouble... disquieted, and untameable. Like Dossi, the figures are generally smaller than life, and often placed in fantastic locales such as ‘’wild boars in the sea, and dolphins in the forests\\".

He engraved twenty-four plates characterized by a peculiar manner of treatment, consisting of the employment of bold parallel strokes without any cross-hatching. Among the more important of them may be mentioned : David, whole-length, with the head of Goliath. David, half-length, with the same. Samson and Delilah. The Beheading of St. John. St. Roch kneeling.

Certain cadets are also selected to take part in Junior Leadership, a group of student leaders selected by teachers in each Kershaw County high school. History Colonel James F. Risher, President of Carlisle Military School and Camden Military Academy Camden Military Academy traces back its tradition from three institutions: Carlisle Military School (1892–1977), Camden Academy (1950–1957), and the present-day Camden Military Academy. The current campus was also formerly occupied by the Southern Aviation School (1940–1944). Carlisle Military School was founded in 1892 in the city of Bamberg, South Carolina as the Carlisle Fitting School of Wofford College. In 1932, Colonel James F. Risher took over the school and continued to run it as an all-male military boarding school. In 1958, his son Colonel William Risher became Headmaster at Carlisle. The school operated until 1977, closing not too long after James F. Risher's death in 1973. Cadets conduct a parade in 2018. The Southern Aviation School was founded in 1940 by Woodward Field (Camden airport) to train pilots during World War II. The academy built many classrooms and barracks to house American and British pilots. Over 6,000 pilots graduated from the academy. After the academy closed in 1944, German prisoners of war were briefly kept in the barracks. The campus and airfield were then left nearly abandoned with many warplanes left behind until 1950. Some buildings built for the Southern Aviation School have been refurbished and are still in use today. Camden Academy was founded in 1950 by the citizens of Camden as an all-male military boarding school built on the former campus of the Southern Aviation School. The school lasted until 1957. In 1958, Colonel James F. Risher, the president of Carlisle Military School, purchased Camden Academy in 1958, and the name was changed to Camden Military Academy. His son Lanning P. Risher was the school's first headmaster and served in the position for 36 years, while his other son William Risher was put in charge of Carlisle. In 1974, Lanning Risher led Camden Military Academy through a reorganization as a non-profit, tax-exempt institution.

An updated re-release was made available on Steam and GOG.com in 2014. The re-release includes support for OS X and Linux.Official English website of Steam re-releaseAnnouncement of the GOG release Plot and setting At the beginning of a new game the player is provided with text introduction to the major events of the game world genesis. According to the introduction, a faction of advanced humans, termed as Spirits, at some point in time gains a technology of creating the Passages between different worlds, the source of technology being Spirits' transcendental contacts. With this knowledge humans undertake rushed construction of the Passages and the new worlds colonization. These events are portrayed in the later Perimeter game, which is the prequel to Vangers. The game of Vangers starts with the Bios of Eleepods producing the player-Vanger. Gameplay-wise, player sees oneself as an automobile-like existence (although protected with regenerating shields, able to be outfitted with weapons and capable of making jumps) in the world- exploration mode. When entering the cities, the player reads the narrations of Bios representatives, is allowed to use the trading facilities, and can ask patterned questions of \\"what or who is\\", about the notions encountered to the point in game. Advancing the plot requires gaining the favor of Bioses, which means for player character to successfully participate in their rituals, to transport goods, to compete with and destroy other, computer-controlled Vangers. Screenshot of Vangers' gameplay Technology Worlds in Vangers were designed by means of Surmap A.R.T., K-D Lab's proprietary terrain editor, and the accompanying voxel-polygonal technology. Minor worlds are modeled to occupy torus surfaces, while three major inhabited worlds form the side surfaces of long cylinders (or rather tori with a single strong barrier set poloidally). Objects of the world are destructible, e.g. vehicle wheels and other impacts leave traces on the ground. Scripted conditional processes are set to affect the terrain. There is a player-controlled option to either keep all changes to the terrain on the hard disk or discard the changes each time the game starts. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Sorry, folks, being weird doesn't always work. still, if you like the story and don't mind reading a lot of text, there is a fun game here.\\" Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World praised the game for its dark, detailed combat simulation with \\"ten strange and wonderful worlds filled with alien creatures and constructs\\". The game was \\"aggressively\\" priced at US$29.95. However, he found the controls confusing and the futuristic vocabulary contrived. In addition, the README file contained solutions to all of the puzzles in the game.

He was selected by the Mets in the 11th round of the Major League Baseball Draft and the 17-year-old signed on June 1, . Roberts pitched mostly out of the bullpen in 1995, but was a starting pitcher in , posting a 9-1 record and 2.10 earned run average. With the Single-A Capital City Bombers, Roberts again pitched well and played in the South Atlantic League All-star game. After an 11-3 record, 2.36 ERA and 8.47 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, Roberts was named the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher. In , Roberts' numbers declined with the St. Lucie Mets and he had elbow surgery in November. He returned from surgery with mediocre numbers in for both the Double-A Binghamton Mets and Triple-A Norfolk Tides. In 2000, Roberts' pitching improved for Norfolk and he was selected to the All-Star Futures Game. On July 27, 2000, with the Mets holding a slight lead in the National League wild card race, Roberts made his major league debut with a terrible start against the Montreal Expos, getting knocked out in the second inning. After what turned out to be the only start of his major league career, Roberts was sent back to the minors until September. When he returned, the Mets were comfortably in the wild card lead and Roberts was in the bullpen for three appearances, highlighted by a four- inning one-hit performance on the last day of the season. Roberts did not pitch in the postseason. When started, Roberts was back in Norfolk and back to pitching mostly in relief, despite having spent most of his minor league career as a starter. The Mets brought him back up for a very good relief appearance in June and Roberts spent all of August and September in the majors. Highlight year interrupted was the highlight of Roberts' career. He made the majors out of spring training and did not give up a single run until his eighth game. He ended April with a 0.69 ERA including his most dominant game on April 15 when he struck out five of the seven batters he faced over two innings pitched. In early June, his ERA dipped to a league-low 0.59, but after surrendering 3 earned runs in one inning on June 8, he was placed on the disabled list with a rotator cuff problem. He returned a few weeks later, but was back on the disabled list with tendinitis after only five games. Roberts was out of action for two months until mid-September. Shortly after, Newsday published a story that seven Mets players, including Roberts, had used marijuana during the season and included a 1998 photograph of Roberts smoking marijuana. Roberts alleged that a former girlfriend made the photograph public after unsuccessfully trying to extort money from him. In 2003, the Queens district attorney decided not to press charges on the woman. Continuing problems with his rotator cuff caused Roberts to start the season on the disabled list. In May, he was moved to the 60-day disabled list and he did not pitch until August. After the season, the Mets cleared Roberts for surgery, but he declined. During spring training of 2004, Roberts was a leading candidate to be the fifth starter, but he began the season in the bullpen after a poor last start. In April 2004, Roberts had an ERA of 17.36 in four relief appearances before returning to the disabled list. In mid-May, Roberts was within minutes of having shoulder surgery when the Mets designated him for assignment cancelling the procedure. The team relented later in the month and Roberts had surgery ending his season. Roberts was granted free agency after the season, but re-signed to a minor league contract with the Mets. Roberts did not make the team after spring training and was released on April 14. On April 22, Roberts and eight other players were suspended for violating baseball's minor league steroids policy. Among the players suspended, Roberts was the only one with major league experience. He was suspended for 15 days which was standard for a first offense at the time. On May 26, 2005, Roberts was signed by the New York Yankees, but he was released on August 22 without pitching in the majors.

Historical marker outside Camp Alvernia with a tribute to Vince Lombardi. Camp Alvernia is a non-profit recreational summer camp in Centerport, New York on the North Shore of Long Island. The camp is located on the east shore of Centerport Harbor, on the Little Neck peninsula. It was founded in 1888 by the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn, who still run the facility now, over 120 years later.Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn Alvernia was the first, and is now the oldest Catholic camp in continuous operation in the United States. Camp Alvernia is currently a day camp that serves 800-900 children ages 3 to 14 from all religious backgrounds, and also continues to serve as a retreat for the Franciscan Brothers.1888: First Catholic Summer Camp Opens by Cynthia Blair, from Newsday's It Happened on Long Island series The Camp offers boating and sailing activities, land and field activities, and swimming in four pools. Scholarships are also awarded each year to families in serious financial need. Originally built as a summer retreat for Franciscan brothers, the facility later became a residential camp for immigrant children living in New York City, who slept in tents until cabins were built in the 1930-40s.Camp Alvernia, The Good Old Days It was originally named \\"Mount Alvernia\\" after the mountain in Italy where Francis of Assisi is said to have received stigmata. Funding for the camp was raised by redeeming Kirkman Soap wrappers, each having a value of two cents.The Founding of Camp Alvernia: 1888 Camp Alvernia was founded as a residential camp for boys. It was a co-ed sleep away and day camp as early as the 1980s (possibly earlier). Boys and girls, ages 5–18, could go for either 3 or 6 week periods of time. (Later changed to 2, 4, 6, or 8 week sessions) Girls traditionally stayed in the dorms attached to the main building, brother residences, and \\"dining hall\\"; there was one room for younger girls, one room for older girls. Boys stayed in traditional cabins with names such as Nest, Den, Bayview, Shady Rest, Stagecoach, and Seaside according to age. There would be a weekly campfire for all sleep away residents. Weekends had a more relaxed feel and a lot more freedom in activities. At the time of its 100th anniversary, it was still run as a simultaneous residential and day camp. Residential students would be awoken by a reveille over the campus wide loudspeaker, meet for breakfast, and then break into their day camp groups, as the day campers would be bused in from local Long Island towns in vans. Keeping with the camp's theme and location, the day camp named its various age groups after tribes of the Iroquois nation. The youngest campers were called the Oneidas, followed by the Mohawk, Huron, Cayuga and the Seneca. The same names are used to this day, although the age groups they refer to have changed. Cayugas are boys and girls who completed pre-k and kindergarten prior to the start of camp, Oneidas are 1st and 2nd graders, Mohawks are 3rd and 4th graders, Hurons are 5th and 6th graders, and Senecas are 7th-9th graders. Historically children were also further separated within their group designation as girls groups and boys groups; throughout the day there would be friendly competition within the designation. within each particular age group, campers would be assigned to a particular number within their group for instance there was Seneca Girls 1, Seneca Girls 2, Seneca Girls 3 a very detailed member of the administration team would assign a daily camp schedule for the day. The activities could include camper choice, soccer, tennis, boating, arts & crafts, dance, swimming, dodge ball, basketball, ping- pong, and for the little ones, many learned to swim for the first time at Camp Alvernia in addition to participation in age appropriate aforementioned sports and age specific games like parachute, red rover, red-light green-light. In 2016, the camp began accepting three year olds in a new age group called the Pequots. Camp activities included traditional arts and crafts and swimming, but also had full sized basketball courts, tennis courts, beach volleyball, soccer, softball, and playing fields. Its specialty was boating, especially windsurfing. Campers would have boating, led by the famous Brother Louie, as he gave an all important safety talk followed by Q&A; under the big shady tree on the sandy hill in front of the boat house. He would tell stories and educate all campers on the importance of their PFD - personal flotation device. This was a square orange life jacket. During the boating period, Brother Louie would name one of his boating specialty counselors skilled in sailing who would stand up, assign the counselor a vessel, and all that were interested in going with that counselor would raise their hands. Brother Louie would select the campers that would go with that counselor and they would take off down the beach on their way. Lastly Brother Louie would assign the age group counselors typically to canoe with the campers not selected for sailing. There were many options for campers. They could canoe, kayak (post 2000), windsurf, sail (sunfish boats) or go on the few larger sailboats 16–20 foot boats for a ride. Before 2000, there would also be \\"field trips\\" excursions to the Commack roller skating rink, Vanderbilt Museum in Centerport, the local arcade (on rainy days), and nearby beaches (Robert Moses for the older campers and Centerport for the younger campers). Another important nostalgic element of camp was the garage where campers could visit the canteen, purchasing candy soda and other little favorites from pocket change their parents might give them throughout the week. Before 2000, and the loss of records in the 1990s, it's important to note that the Franciscan brothers were a collaborate but competitive athletic group of mentors. Camp Alvernia had a competitive softball team that traveled several times a summer to play against other camps. By 1990 the all boy softball team recognized female talent and opened participation up to a few female players (Tonya Cavallaro was their first female pitcher). Overall the leaders of the camp, both Franciscan brothers and Carol family did a great job engaging both female and male campers with athletic and non athletic activities, encouraging participation, and recognizing all campers accomplishments. They recognized participation in all activities during the day with an elaborate points system accompanied by an elaborate (manual) record keeping system (that was probably lost in the damage that was done as it was before the days of the internet and cloud). Points were awarded for any effort and participation called \\"participation points\\". Counselors were charged with record keeping each day handing in the point sheets. Campers could earn additional points if their particular group won at an assigned activity such as soccer over another group. For instance Senaca Girls Group 1 VS. Senaca Girls Group 2. period 3. There was even methodology set out to give points for ties. This point system bonded the individual groups even further as they learned to play fairly, work together, build character, and win and loose graciously. Campers could also earn individual additional points if they placed in the camp marathon, or placed in track and field races among all campers of their particular age and gender. All campers would earn participation points for participating. At Friday award ceremonies, 1st - 4th place ribbons were given out for track and field events, camper of the week in each group would be awarded a button and certificate. These points were cumulative over the course of the summer and impressively, year after year. There were milestones awards for points over cumulative years. The highest recognition of points would be 16,000 A's which would earn the camper a plaque, recognition at the awards ceremony. Along the way, there were chevrons for milestones. This was arguably a great system because even the most nonathletic camper over time would earn these acknowledgements. This community spirit of cheering on others' various accomplishments was reinforced by the unique clapping system every Alverian clap equaled two claps with a pause. One of the brothers, or camp director would typically MC'ed weekly awards in the 1980s and 1990s. They would ask all to hold their applause until the end and then depending on the age group and accomplishment they would give those campers a respective number of Alvernians. So they could ask for two and a half Alvernians which would be clap-clap, pause, clap-clap, pause, clap. This would sound impressive coming from several hundred campers in a dome, garage, or even on a hillside depending on where the awards ceremony was held that week. Upon the conclusion of the summer there was excitement and anticipation building up to a full afternoon of awards to conclude the summer. There were awards for every area of camp activity specialty for boys and girls in every respective group from Mohawk all the way to Senaca in the form of a bronze, silver, and gold metal including an overall best female and best male trophy in that category named after a Franciscan Brother. The award recipient was decided upon by the counselors in those respective age groups based on performance throughout the summer. There were categories like boating, arts & crafts, soccer, softball, tennis, swimming, and track & field. The annual awards ceremony for decades ended with camper/athlete of the year, typically awarded to a Senaca the oldest group, someone who was enrolled in the last session of the camp, and typically was there all summer. These were not necessarily requirements but obvious attributes of the winner. These campers were nominated and voted on by all the counselors. There was great anticipation of who would win the prestigious title every year and typically the individuals that were the 12 runner ups and winners were campers of high drive and athleticism. In the summer of 2000, Camp Alvernia developed a course called \\"Leadership Skills in Community Youth Recreation.\\" The course was based in part on the camp's annual pre-camp orientation program, and participating camp counselors earn college credit. The Love of Learning Montessori method school moved to the grounds of Camp Alvernia in September 2004.We Have a New Home Love of Learning Montessori In the 1990s, many of the camp's records were thrown out, having suffered water damage. In 2010, the camp began a concerted effort to reconnect with former campers and counselors. In 2012, the camp built two new pools to provide additional space for recreational and instructional swim programs. The camp also conducts a greatly expanded boating program, with paddle boats, canoes, kayaks, stand up paddleboards (SUPs), and sailboats. The camp also offers a sailing certification program through US Sailing.
