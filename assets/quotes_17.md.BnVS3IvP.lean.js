Curriculum  It offers a four-year political officer training course for enlisted soldiers who have served for at least three years and for non-commissioned officers. Graduates of this course become political officers with the rank of sowi (junior lieutenant) with the best graduates attaining the rank of chungwi (lieutenant). There are also supplementary courses for political officers. Political officers with a rank higher than a company instructor can take a three-year duty supplementary course, while officers set for promotion can take a six-month short-term supplementary course.

Born in the Russian Empire, he was sent before World War II to the United States by his father, Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman, to improve the level of Jewish education there. He established yeshivas in the United States and Israel. He was described as \\"a pioneer educator\\". Early life and family Elazar Simcha Wasserman was born in the Russian Empire, the eldest of the three sons born to Elchonon Wasserman and his wife Michla. He was a nephew of Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzensky. He married Feiga Rachel, the daughter of Rabbi Meir Abowitz, Rav of Novordok, and his wife Chana. Except for him, all of his birth family died during World War II. He and his wife, who outlived him, had no children. Career Although most of his career was in the United States, Wasserman established his first rabbinical seminary in Strasbourg in 1933. During the 1940s Wasserman strengthened Detroit's Yeshiva Beth Yehudah and served as dean. It had been founded in 1914 as a Talmud Torah and renamed as a yeshiva in 1925. Yeshiva Ohr Elchonon Two of the schools founded by Wasserman were named Yeshiva Ohr Elchonon, one in the United States, the other in Israel. The school in Los Angeles included elementary, secondary, college, and post-graduate classes, with some students \\"from as far as Arizona and Colorado\\". Ten of the initial students at the college and post-graduate school were sent from Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, handpicked by Rabbi Gedalia Schorr. This was well before the school attained 300 students. Outreach Among the keywords describing Wasserman's methodology are patience and simplicity: \\"Whatever is within my ability to fulfill I do, and whatever I can’t accomplish I don’t worry about.\\" In 1970 he wrote an article for The Jewish Observer titled \\"Memorandum To: Concerned individuals From: Rabbi Simcha Wasserman Re: Reaching out\\" in which he encourages more outreach \\"to the entire Jewish community,\\" adding that \\"Unless the public is Torah educated, the Yeshiva contributor will soon be supplanted by the philanthropist whose list of priorities does not even include Yeshivos.\\" He was not a fan of \\"new and improved\\" when it came to Judaism: \\"... the plastic potato. It looked like a potato, smelled like a potato, even tasted like a potato .. the only significant difference .. was that when you planted a plastic potato, it didn’t grow, it couldn’t reproduce, it was sterile.\\" Works While in Israel he facilitated the reprinting of his father's works; some of his own writings were printed in a booklet, Simchat Elazar.

Julia was also slated to provide an installation and performance for the 2020 Contemporary Arts Museum Houston Gala and Art Auction.  The Oracle of Vector Gallery  Since 2015, Sinelnikova has performed as The Oracle of Vector Gallery. Run by visual artist and gallerist, JJ Brine, Julia started out at Vector Gallery’s Chinatown, New York City space before it moved to Los Angeles.  Rootkit  Taking over Superchief’s 7,000 square foot Brooklyn warehouse in 2018, Sinelnikova created an installation titled “Rootkit.” Inspired by cyberpunk novel, Snow Crash, the installation incorporated projectors, TVs, hand-cut mylar, binary code, among other materials to represent the invisible world of cyber warfare. Alongside the installation, Sinelnikova acted out a scene from the book.  Organ Farm at Industry City  Presented by Wallplay in 2017, Sinelnikova’s solo installation “Organ Farm,” showcased her hand-cut holographic works at Industry City in Brooklyn. For this show, Sinelnikova released a video featuring her SAMJNA sculpture with projections, light, and music.  Banff Centre Residency  Sinelnikova took part in a three-week residency for the Banff Centre in Alberta, Canada in 2016.

During the residency, Sinelnikova focused on an installation, titled “SENTINEL – Temple of Self Awareness,” which showed in 2015 at The Museum of Human Achievement in Austin, Texas.  Chasm  Sinelnikova produced a party and exhibition in Bushwick, Brooklyn in 2016 titled “Chasm.” The event featured Sinelnikova’s LED sculptures, alongside performers and a DJ. In addition to showcasing her work, Chasm brought attention to the lack of affordable spaces for artists in expensive cities like New York.  Ghost  In 2016, Sinelnikova modelled for New York-based photographer, filmmaker, and multimedia artist Laura Weyl. Created in the abandoned Port Authority Grain Terminal in Red Hook, Brooklyn, Weyl photographed Sinelnikova for a series titled, “Ghost.”  Powered  Featured alongside Ben Copperwheat, and other New York artists, Julia Sinelnikova presented her “Fairy Organs,” during an exhibition titled “Powered” in 2015.

It was part of the pagus of Hainaut, in Lower Lotharingia, within the Holy Roman Empire. In the 10th century he is often mentioned together with the margrave of the next imperial fort to the north, at Ename, who was also count of Mons, Count Godefrey \\"the captive\\".Lays p.124 He was possibly the same person as his contemporary Arnulf the count of Cambrai. 10th century As listed out by Ulrich Nonn (p. 130), many of the sources which list Arnulf and Godefrey as counts in Hainaut are clerical narrative sources rather than dated charters. The Gesta of the Bishops of Cambrai for example lists the two counts as coming next in a sequence of counts in Hainaut, after the two brothers Werner and Reynold, who in turn replaced Count Richer. While several such sources describe Count Godefrey very clearly as the Count in Mons, only one, the Translatio s. Sulpicii, describes this Arnulf specifically as a count of Valenciennes. Only one record seems to describe Arnulf as a margrave rather than count, and this is a military listing made in 982, where Gottefredus et Arnulfus marchiones are listed among many different imperial leaders who were responsible to bring a certain number of armoured knights, for the imperial campaign being planned in Italy. Arnulf also appears clearly named in charters of Saint Peter's Abbey in Ghent, which also names his wife and son in several cases. This shows that he had possessions on both sides of the Flemish march, in both the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire. In 998 one such charter shows that he held Mater, very close to the frontier fort of Ename, seat of the march held by Godefrid the captive.Fayen p.98, Van Lokeren p.69. 11th century A count named Arnulf, and generally equated to Arnulf of Valenciennes, who had rights in Cambrai, had them given by emperor Otto III to the bishop of Cambrai in 1001, and then in 1007, without naming any count, his successor Henry II granted the county of Cambrai to the bishop.MGH Diplomata of Otto III, p.832; Diplomata of Henry II, p.168. Arnulf out-lived Godefried the Captive who died in 1002, and at some point before he died, a count named Reginar was in control of Mons, either Reginar IV or V. This was recorded in an account of the miracle of St Ghislain.de Waha, p.78 Late in life, in the years before he died, the Vita Balderici written in Liège reports that Arnulf's fort at Valenciennes had come under pressure from the County of Flanders. In 1006 Baldwin IV of Flanders took control of Valenciennes. Falling ill, his kinsman Bishop Balderic travelled to visit him and he counseled him to leave his \\"castrum\\", possibly Valenciennes itself, or possibly Visé, to the bishopric. Balderic returned to Liège and the Vita says he was trying to gather a military force when Arnulf died. This has been determined by modern historians to have been in 2011. Matching dates, different by one day, can be found in necrologies in Liège and Cambrai.See Marchandisse and Koch & De Meyer. Arnulf's widow Lietgarde, struggling to maintain herself under pressure from Flanders, attempted to travel to Liège, but was taken captive by Count Lambert I of Louvain. The Vita reports that Lambert, who had attacked and defeated Balderic II in the Battle of Hoegaarden in 1013, took the opportunity to force Lietgarde to cede rights in Hanret to him, which he then ceded to Balderic II. These rights in Hanret became part of the possessions of the new Cathedral of St James which Bishop Balderic founded in Liège.See Lays and Stiennon Family His mother was named as a Countess Bertha, in documents concerning grants she made in favour of Sint-Truiden Abbey just before she died in 967.Diplomata Belgica 1613; Hemptinne et al. nr. 95, pp.155-157; = Piot ed. Vol.1, p.72. Not only was her son and heir a Count Arnulf, but Dhondt and Vanderkindere pointed to a shared connection to the , near Lille about 45 km west of Valenciennes and in the kingdom of France.Dhondt (1943) 47-75; Vanderkindere, (1902) Vol.1, 294 and Vol.2, 84. The version of the grant recorded in the chronicle of Sint-Truiden itself, showed that she had rights in the area of Sint-Truiden itself, in Melveren and Brustem.Gestorum Abbatem Trudonensium Continuatio Tertia, 3.12-3.14, years 964-972, Koepke ed. (MGH), p.379; = de Borman ed. p.131; = Lavigne trans. p.221. He and his wife and son appear in a 994 Ghent St Peter charter granting Carvin in Caribant to the Abbey, and he made another grant in 983 for the soul of his late brother Rodger, of Corulis in Caribant.994: Fayen ed. p.95 charter 101, Van Lokeren p.63 charter 78; and 983: Fayen ed. p.91 charter 93, Van Lokeren ed. p.53 charter 58. It has been pointed out by historian Bas Aarts that the witnesses in the grant of Bertha also match partially with another grant by a Bertha with a son Arnulf, to Nivelles Abbey, of 5 manses with meadow and forest on the upper Dyle river. In that charter two younger brothers of Arnulf are named: Herman and Geveard.Aarts, (1988) p.51 note 365; Aarts (1994) p.72 note 66. Primary source: Dillo and Van Synghel charter 890. His father is not named in medieval records, but it has been proposed on the basis of him being count of Cambrai, and his name, that his father must be the Arnulf who was named as a son of Count Isaac of Cambrai in 941.Ghent, Abbey of St Peter, Liber traditionum: ‘Signum Isaac comitis. Signum Arnulifi filii ejus’. In Van Lokeren ed., nr.18, 24-26; = Fayen ed., nr.65, 67-72. It has also been proposed by Vanderkindere that there was a count of Valenciennes before him named Count Amulric who is mentioned in two records from about 953 to 973. In the earliest record from the 950s he was described as a count from Hainaut, and it was mentioned that he had married a daughter of Isaac, Count of Cambrai, but the marriage had been annulled by the bishop due to them being too closely related.Vanderkindere (1902) Vol.2 pp.71-72 He was a close relative of Bishop Balderic II of Liège, who was in the family of the Counts of Loon. This relationship was noted in two later Liège documents, the Vita (life story) of Balderic himself, and a falsified charter, supposedly made 1015.1015 charter: Diplomata Belgica 3310. Vanderkindere believed this must have been a connection through his mother Bertha's side.Vanderkindere, (1902) Vol.2 pp.80-83; citing the use of the term cognatio in Vita Balderici, Ch.21, p.732. His wife, who survived him, was named Lietgard or Luitgard. It has been proposed that she had a connection to family of the counts of Namur, both because of her son's name, Adalbert, and because after the death of Arnulf she was involved in transactions which led to the acquisition of Hanret, which is in the direction of Namur, by Lambert I, Count of Louvain.Vanderkindere (1902) Vol.2 p.85. Arnulf and Lietgard had a son named Adalbert (Albert), who predeceased both of them. The obituaries kept by the Saint-Lambert in Liège commemorate the deaths of both Count Arnulf (23 October) and Count Adalbert (30 March) for their grant of Visé to them, showing that Arnulf had an important patrimony very close to Liège itself.Marchandisse p.44 (‘III kalendas apriles [30 March]: commemoratio Adalberti comitis qui dedit nobis Viosaz’); p.145 (‘kalendas novembres [23 October]: commemoratio Arnulphi comitis qui dedit nobis Viusaz’).

Design  The ARM Cortex-A78 is the successor to the ARM Cortex-A77. It can be paired with the ARM Cortex-X1 and/or ARM Cortex-A55 CPUs in a DynamIQ configuration to deliver both performance and efficiency. The processor also claims as much as 50% energy savings over its predecessor. The Cortex-A78 is a 4-wide decode out-of-order superscalar design with a 1.5K macro-OP (MOPs) cache. It can fetch 4 instructions and 6 Mops per cycle. And rename and dispatch 6 Mops, and 13 µops per cycle. The out-of-order window size is 160 entries. And the backend is 13 execution ports with a pipeline depth of 13 stages and the execution latencies consists of 10 stages. The processor is built on a standard Cortex-A roadmap and offers a 2.1 GHz (5 nm) chipset which makes it better than its predecessor in the following ways: * 7% better performance * 4% lower power consumption * 5% smaller, meaning 15% more area serving for a quad-core cluster, extra GPU, NPU There is also extended scalability with extra support from Dynamic Shared Unit for DynamIQ on the chipset. A smaller 32 KB L1 cache from the 64 KB L1 cache configuration is optional. To offset this smaller L1 memory, the branch predictor is better at covering irregular search patterns and is capable of following two taken branches per cycle, which results in fewer L1 cache misses and helps hide pipeline bubbles to keep the core well supplied. The pipeline is one cycle longer compared to the A77, which ensures that the A78 hits a clock frequency target of around 3 GHz. The A78 is a 6 instruction per cycle design. ARM also introduced a second integer multiple unit in the execution unit and an additional load Address Generation Unit (AGU) to increase both the data load and bandwidth by 50%. Other optimizations of the chipset include fused instructions and efficiency improvements to instruction schedulers, register renaming structures, and the reorder buffer. L2 cache is variable up to 512 KB and has double the bandwidth to maximize the performance, while the shared L3 cache is variable up to 4 MB, double that of previous generations. A Dynamic Shared Unit (DSU) also allows for an 8 MB configuration with the ARM Cortex-X1.

It is part of the Pavilion Gardens complex of buildings in the town's central Conservation Area. It has a main 360-seat theatre, and since 2017 it has been the home of Buxton Cinema.  Background  The Pavilion Arts Centre is Buxton's second theatre, located behind the Buxton Opera House which is the town's principal theatre venue with 900 seats. The two theatres share a programme of events staged by the same organisation. In 2010 the Paxton Suite was redeveloped and opened as the Pavilion Arts Centre with a smaller Studio Theatre as well as the main theatre. The centre is one of the main venues for the annual Buxton Festival and for the town's Fringe Festival. It is the oldest surviving theatre in Buxton. The earliest theatre in Buxton was in a thatched house on Spring Gardens, which staged performances from c.1784 to c.1829 at the foot of Hardwick Street (replaced by Milligan's Drapery and Milliner's shop and where the Argos store is now). From 1830 to 1854 the theatre moved to the end of the Broad Walk, in the old hall stables opposite the Old Hall Hotel at the foot of Hall Bank. In 1833 the world-famous violinist Niccolo Paganini performed there. After this theatre was demolished in 1854, performances were held variously at the Assembly Room, the Courthouse and the Independent Chapel. In 1889 the Entertainment Stage was opened by actor John Toole. It was also known as the New Theatre. When the Buxton Opera House theatre was opened in 1903, the New Theatre was modified to show silent movies and changed its name to the Hippodrome. In 1932 it reverted to a performance theatre and became The Playhouse. An annual festival ran from 1937 to 1942, in conjunction with Lilian Baylis's theatre company from London's Old Vic Theatre, with plays at the Opera House and a summer school at The Playhouse theatre. The Playhouse had its own resident reperatory company, which included Sir Nigel Hawthorne. In 1979 it was renamed again as The Paxton Suite. The Pavilion Arts Centre is a Grade-II listed building. It was designed for the Buxton Gardens Company by local architect William Radford Bryden and was built of millstone grit stone by James Salt. The large shaped gables feature theatrical masks of comedy and tragedy. Bryden also designed the nearby Old Clubhouse (originally the Union Club), Solomon's Temple and the remodelling of the Thermal Baths in the 1880s. When Buxton Cinema opened in 2017, it marked the end of three decades for the town without a cinema and a return to the original cinema venue in the town. Buxton's first cinema was The Hippodrome in 1903. The Picture House was then built in 1916 on Spring Gardens (on the site of the demolished Victoria Arcade and Swedish Gymnasium). Buxton Opera House opened in 1903 and it was converted to a cinema in 1927 which closed in 1976. In 1937 The Picture House was remodelled as the art deco Spa Cinema, running until its closure in the 1960s. It was then used as a bingo hall but reopened as a cinema in 1976 after the Opera House cinema had closed. It was closed in 1986 and demolished in 1987. The Job Centre building and a supermarket now stand on the site.

Owen was the fourth tropical low, first tropical cyclone, and first severe tropical cyclone of the 2018–19 Australian region cyclone season. Owen formed on November 29 from an area of low pressure situated over the Solomon Islands. Owen slowly strengthened, but then degenerated into a remnant low on December 9, as it made landfall in Queensland for the first time, before entering the Gulf of Carpentaria. It regenerated on 12 December. Cyclone Owen rapidly intensified into a Category 3, and circled around the Gulf of Carpentaria. Then, it struck Queensland. After re-entering the Coral Sea, which had colder waters than the Gulf of Carpentaria, Owen weakened relatively quickly, and turned extratropical on December 17. Owen was beneficial to some parts of Australia during its duration. The rainfall dropped on deserts helped farmers grow crops and helped put out a bushfire. As a tropical low, Owen produced some minor impacts in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The final advisory was issued on December 17, when Owen was situated between Townsville and Cairns. However, Cyclone Owen's extratropical remnants persisted until December 20. The erratic path of Owen is thought to come from a high-pressure area that tracked near the storm. Owen also brought to Australia the highest rainfall ever recorded in the month of December, with rainfall in Halifax, Queensland reaching 661 mm (26 in). Meteorological history During 29 November, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that Tropical Low 04U had developed in the Solomon Sea about to the northwest of Honiara in the Solomon Islands. The system was located within an environment that was favourable for further development, with low to moderate vertical windshear and high sea surface temperatures of . Over the next couple of days, the system moved southwards over the Solomon Sea and gradually developed further, as atmospheric convection consolidated close to the centre. The moderately favourable conditions caused Tropical Low 04U to further develop and gain more thunderstorms within it. These conditions contributed to 04U's convection, and at about 12:00 UTC on 2 December, 04U strengthened and was named Owen. However, Owen soon encountered relatively unfavourable conditions, and struggled to maintain deep convection. The increasing wind shear and other factors caused Owen to weaken slightly early on 3 December. Soon after that, though, Owen gained a burst of convection, and strengthened again. By noon on 3 December, Owen was struggling to remain a tropical cyclone and could not intensify further. As the day progressed, Owen became increasingly disorganized, and continued to weaken. By 4 December, Owen was continuing to lose convection and diminish. However, in the east, there were more favourable conditions, so Owen moved slightly to the east. However, to the east, Owen encountered even more unfavorable conditions, and weakened into a tropical low. Over the next six days, Owen moved towards Queensland as a tropical low. At around 18:00 UTC on 9 December (04:00 AEST, 10 December), Owen's remnant tropical low made landfall on the Cape York Peninsula near Port Douglas in Queensland. Over the next day, the system moved eastwards and emerged into the Gulf of Carpentaria, at about 14:00 UTC on 10 December (00:00 AEST, 11 December). Through 11 December, 04U's intensity remained roughly the same as it continued to move westward. By 12 December, 04U was still slowly moving west and not changing intensity. Early on 12 December, though, conditions started to become more favourable, and 04U's convection increased. Then, at about 12:00 UTC on 12 December, 04U strengthened into a Category 1 tropical cyclone. Owen rapidly intensified overnight into a low-end Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, making its outer bands hit areas of Queensland and Northern Territory. Owen made landfall in Northern Territory at about 00:00 UTC on 13 December as a Category 3. Early on 13 December, Owen developed an eye for the first time. Over the next few hours, Owen intensified even more, until it reached its peak intensity of 150 km/h (90 mph) at 12:00 UTC. Late on 13 December, Owen approached Queensland, still a Category 3. By 14 December, convection was excellent, and Owen continued to stay a Category 3. Early in the morning on 14 December, Owen's eye began to turn ragged while continuing to move eastward. Owen then began to weaken into a borderline Category 3, due to decreasing sea surface temperatures. At around 20:30 UTC on 14 December, the BoM reported that Owen had made landfall as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, on an uninhabited stretch of coast to the northwest of Port McArthur. Over the next few hours, the system lingered over the coast, before it turned back east and virtually retraced its steps across the Gulf of Carpentaria. At around 17:00 UTC on 14 December, Owen made landfall as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, on the mouth of the Gilbert River about to the southwest of Kowanyama in Queensland. While over Queensland, for the last time, Owen lost convection and rapidly weakened into a tropical low. Then, as Owen entered the Coral Sea, Owen became subtropical and moved east-southeast. The system was last noted by the BoM during December 20, while it was located about to the northeast of Townsville in Queensland. Effects=Papua New Guinea Cyclone Owen caused significant damage in Papua New Guinea. High daily rainfall totals on December 1 relieved a period of dry weather lasting for months. Solomon Islands As a tropical low, Owen caused minimal damage in the Solomon Islands from 29 November to 2 December. Actual damage was limited to beach erosion and falling trees. Australia Within Australia, Owen impacted parts of northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, as well as various islands located within the Gulf of Carpentaria. =Queensland= Cyclone Owen, as an ex-tropical low, making landfall in Queensland on December 10. Cyclone Owen made several landfalls in Queensland throughout its duration. Heavy rainfall, flash floods, and storm surge killed one person and caused $25 million worth of damage. Extremely heavy winds devastated Cape York in northern Australia. Owen's landfalls brought effects hundreds of kilometres inland. Near dissipation, Owen went out to sea as a subtropical low, and caused some minor damage in the eastern part of Queensland. The extratropical remnants of Owen caused some more minimal damage, before dissipating entirely. When Owen made landfall in the Northern Territory on December 10, there were also minor effects in Queensland. Throughout its duration, Cyclone Owen dumped very heavy and intense rain on Queensland. On 17 December, when the rapidly dissipating Subtropical Low Owen approached Queensland a third time, it caused rain to fall at a rate of over 97 mm (3.8 in) per hour. Inland Queensland got about 40 mm (1.6 in) per hour. Cyclone Owen brought to Queensland the highest rainfall in December ever recorded in the region, with rainfall in Halifax, Queensland reaching 661 mm (26 in). Catastrophic rainfall occurred as Category 3 severe tropical cyclone Owen made landfall in Queensland. Owen's second and most severe landfall left 2,400 residents powerless. Queensland recorded several hailstorms from Owen. Many people thought that Owen would drop catastrophic rain levels; however, Owen did not drop as much rain to such a large area, due to its relatively small size. However, in the small areas where Owen did hit, rainfall was catastrophic, and while it did put out several bushfires, Owen also caused many landslides in Queensland, which caused terrible damage. Most of the rest of the damage resulted from flash floods, which drowned one person. =Northern Territory= As a post- tropical low, Cyclone Owen made its first destructive landfall in the Northern Territory. Rainfall amounted to about 20 mm (0.79 in) in total. Many of Owen's landfalls in Queensland also affected Northern Territory. Port Roper, Port McArthur, and Groote Eylandt got hit by floods, heavy rainfall, and high winds repeatedly at various intensities. Cyclone Owen, as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, made landfall just west of the Queensland/Northern Territory border, and caused some moderate damage. Soon, however, Cyclone Owen went to Queensland, and warnings in Northern Territory were lifted.

Succeeding his father in business, Mitchell was Director of Stephen Mitchell & Son for approximately 38 years, and was a significant figure in 19th-century tobacco manufacturing, then one of the largest industries in the West of Scotland.  Early life  Stephen Mitchell was born on 19 September 1789Scotland, Select Births and Baptisms, 1564-1950; Old Parish Registers 668/40 467 Linlithgow in Ecclesmachan, Linlithgowshire (now West Lothian), into a long-established family of tobacco and snuff merchants and burghers. Records of the family of Stephen Mitchell go back to the early 16th century; the Mitchells were tenants of Waulkmilton, Muiravonside, Linlithgowshire from 1568 to about 1723.Commissariot Record of Stirling, Register of Testaments, 1607-1800 Mitchell was baptised at Linlithgow on 13 March 1790, the eldest of the ten children of Stephen Mitchell (1768–1821) of Ecclesmachan,Scotland, Select Births and Baptisms, 1564-1950 and Agnes Neilson (1767–1840) of Glasgow.  Education  Mitchell attended Linlithgow Grammar School (built in the 1620s and later destroyed by fire), which stood to the south of St. Michael’s Parish Church in the Kirkgate area of the town. He was regarded as being a good student, who passed through a better than ordinary course of general culture for the time, including Classics and French. In 1805, he began a four-year apprenticeship with Messrs. James Anderson & Co., merchants, of Leith and London. In 1809, Stephen Mitchell entered the family tobacco- manufacturing business, Stephen Mitchell & Son, which was set up in 1723 by his great-grandfather, also named Stephen Mitchell. This family business originally comprised a shop in town at 150Mary Stuart Mitchell or Aspin (1879-1873) and Rosemary Kennedy Aspin (1917-2009). \\"Mitchell Family History\\" MS, held in Special Collections department, The Mitchell Library, Glasgow. High Street, Linlithgow, in the Vennel area, on the corner leading to the Loch (at one time the site of Linlithgow Library) \\\\- and a snuff-mill in the countryside at Waulkmilton. The business benefitted from its convenient situation between the tobacco supplies of Glasgow and the market facilities of Edinburgh and grew until the period of the American Revolution and its resulting negative impact on European tobacco prices. This economic downturn had convinced Stephen Mitchell’s father to leave Scotland and seek employment in the tobacco trade of the United States of America; setting off in August 1784 and eventually returning around the summer of 1787, he observed and worked for operators establishing industrialised tobacco manufacture in the Petersburg and Richmond areas of Virginia.  Personal life  Stephen Mitchell had no children and never married, and family history records suggest that the reason he remained a bachelor was because of a disappointment in love: both he and his brother Nelson (also known as Neilson) Mitchell (1801-1889) had courted the same woman (thought to be Isabella Cameron - also known as Mary or May), but she finally decided to marry Nelson/Neilson in 1834.Scotland, Select Marriages, 1561-1910  Public life  On 8 November 1817, Mitchell carried on a family tradition by being admitted a Burgess and Guild Brother of Linlithgow. He was also admitted to the Fraternity of Dyers, the only surviving Trade Guild of the Royal Burgh, which continues to take part in the annual Riding of the Marches. In the early years of the business, Mitchell had to do a considerable amount of travelling, mainly on horseback, and he was a keen rider. His thrift is demonstrated a letter to his mother, in which he wrote: “I live as frugally and cheaply as circumstances will allow.” alt= Following the death of his father in July 1821, Stephen Mitchell took over the running of the business (the fourth of that name to do so), in partnership with his brother, Nelson (aka Neilson) Mitchell. In 1825, a change in import legislation and customs rules restricted the import of tobacco to a few designated chief ports with bonded warehouses. The port of Blackness on the Firth of Forth, historically the port of Linlithgow, was excluded from this change, and so Mitchell transferred the business of Stephen Mitchell & Son, wholesale tobacconist, to Glasgow, establishing new premises at 106 Candleriggs. Despite competition from other tobacco manufacturing firms already established in the city, the business prospered and, by 1832, had prestigious premises at 49/51 (later 36) St. Andrew's Square, Glasgow. Mitchell initially set up home at 40 Charlotte Street in Glasgow but, subsequently, lived at 63 Abbotsford PlaceGlasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland, Electoral Registers, 1857-1962 (entries for 1857 and 1858) and, later, 144 West Campbell Street.Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland, Electoral Registers, 1857-1962 (entries for 1859 and 1863) In his will,Wills and Testaments Reference SC15/41/15 Dumfries Sheriff Court Mitchell is also described as having been resident at 13 St. Enoch Square. alt= Mitchell remained as Director of the business until 1859, when he retired to the popular spa town of Moffat, Dumfriesshire, residing at Floral Cottage in Well Road.1871 Scotland Census; Parish: Moffat; ED: 4; Page: 37; Line: 17; Roll: CSSCT1871_185  Death  Stephen Mitchell died at Moffat on 21 April 1874, the cause given as a fractured skull following a fall.Statutory Registers Deaths 842/22Statutory Registers Corrected Entries 842/00 001 36 (RCE) A local newspaper reported what had happened: > It appears that Mr. Mitchell had gone out after nine o’clock, and had been > seen in the forenoon near Archbank, as if going to the mineral well.

Legacy  Mitchell’s will indicated that, while he made his money from tobacco, he had invested his wealth almost exclusively in railways, mainly in Great Britain but also in North America. Having no direct descendants to whom he could leave his fortune, he made provision for legacies and annuities to extended family members, friends and employees as well as for a church - £500 to the Unitarian Congregation, St. Vincent Street, Glasgow - and for other charitable organisations such as Glasgow Royal Infirmary, charitable organisations such as Glasgow Asylum for the Blind, Glasgow Society for the Deaf and Dumb, and Glasgow Old Man’s Friendly Society. Although he is thought not to have taken part in public affairs during his lifetime, Stephen Mitchell’s will also ensured provision of the residue of his estate, amounting to £66,998 10s. 6d., in a trust deed for the establishment and maintenance of a large Public Library \\"with all the modern accessories connected therewith.\\" Rather than insisting that the library bore his name, he stated that his bequest should be the nucleus of the fund and allowed for “contributions from others”. This public bequest was to be offered first to Glasgow but, if the City did not accept the conditions within six months, it was to be offered to Edinburgh. Glasgow Corporation was notified of the bequest on 6 May 1874, and it was formally accepted on 16 July of that year. Before adopting the Public Libraries (Scotland) Act of 1854, Glasgow had utilised rate-levying powers in local Acts to raise the required funding for continuing the maintenance of libraries. According to Mitchell’s stipulation, a constitution for the running of the library was later drawn up embodying the principal provisions of the trust deed, namely that the library was to be known as The Mitchell Library; that the amount of the bequest was to be allowed to remain at interest until it amounted to £70,000, or if thought necessary a larger sum, before a commencement was made; that in the selection of books to form the library, no books should be excluded on the ground that they contravene present opinions on politics or religion; that the library should be freely open to the public under suitable regulations; that contributions of money or of books might be accepted; and that collections of books might be kept together and known by the donor's or other distinctive name. A Library Committee, appointed by Glasgow Town Council, and under the convenership of ex-Bailie James Salmon (architect, born 1805), proceeded with the organization of the library. In 1876, as a first step towards the implementation of Mitchell’s wishes, the Town Clerk, Dr. James David Marwick (1826-1908), drew up a report on the subject, which stated that “the committee see no reason why, under proper management, the Mitchell Library may not become…second only, as a public library, to that of the British Museum.” It points out that “care must specially be taken that no opportunities are lost of enriching the library, from time to time, with the rarer and more costly works which are only to be found in great libraries”. The report emphasises the classless nature of the library as “the command of such appliances of knowledge as the Mitchell Library will offer to every person in Glasgow, is a boon which cannot be regarded as in any sense limited to a class.” A final quotation stresses that “adequate provision should be made at the first for indefinite future expansion. The situation of such a building should be central and the building itself worthy of Glasgow.” Mitchell library The Mitchell Library was formally opened on 1 November 1877, by the Hon. James Bain, Lord Provost and on Monday 5 November its doors were opened to the public. By 1977, it laid claim to being the largest public reference library in Europe. It is thought that Mitchell’s bequest may have been prompted by his wide reading and his interest in self-improvement. He is said to have encouraged and assisted the boys and girls in his employment to attend evening classes at Glasgow’s recently- founded Andersonian Institution. He also spent much of his time in the backroom of the bookseller’s shop which housed the Moffat Subscription Library where “in congenial companionship he talked in appreciative insight of books”. This library had been established in the year of Mitchell’s birth by James Clarke (1761-1825), the Rector of Moffat Grammar School, at the suggestion of his friend and fellow Dumfriesshire resident, Robert Burns, who also donated a number of books. Mitchell is also said to have delighted in Burns’ association with the library. Another suggested influence on Mitchell’s bequest is the minister who had baptised him, The Rev. Robert Henry (1718-1790). Henry was also a historian who had wished to bequeath his books to the Town Council of Linlithgow for the establishment of a public library there, but this is said not to have materialised because of the poor wording of his will.  Stephen Mitchell & Son  After Stephen Mitchell’s death, his brother Nelson (aka Neilson) Mitchell took over the business; being succeeded, in turn, by Nelson's son, also named Stephen Mitchell (1847-1920) of Boquhan, Stirlingshire. The Imperial Tobacco Company (Great Britain and Ireland) Ltd. was created in December 1901 through the amalgamation of 13 British tobacco and cigarette manufacturing companies which were being threatened by competition from the American Tobacco Company: initially W. D. & H. O. Wills of Bristol merged with Stephen Mitchell & Son and, subsequently, other smaller companies joined in the amalgamation. However, Stephen Mitchell & Son continued to trade under its own name and retained responsibility for its own manufacturing and selling until well into the 20th century.

A copy of this silhouette, was lent by Mrs. Tod of Moffat \\\\- née Dorothea Thomson (1831-1894), the widow of Stephen's nephew, James Thomas (1827-1865) - was lent to sculptor John Mossman (1817-1890) for the purpose of creating a portrait bust in clay; apart from that, Mossman had only a single photograph of Stephen Mitchell, shown with a book on a table beside him, from which to work. Commissioned posthumously by the City Council, Mossman's finished marble commemorative bust was completed in 1881, and is on display at the entrance to the Mitchell Library at 201 North Street. A contemporary account describes how it was received: > Those who knew Mr, Mitchell are of opinion that notwithstanding the want of > any but very slight materials, Mr. Mossman has succeeded in producing a bust > which is excellent as a likeness, as it is acknowledged by all who have seen > it to be admirable as a work of art.

She also became famous for her role in resisting the French invasion of the city of Tomar in the Santarém District of Portugal during the Napoleonic Wars. Biography Angela Tamagnini was born in Milan, Italy on 26 October 1770. She moved to Portugal in 1783 together with her uncle, Inácio Francisco Tamagnini, who became the doctor of Queen Maria I. In 1795, she married António Florêncio de Abreu e Andrade, son of a rich tobacco and soap trader. Her husband died in 1806.She had one son, João. Her great-grandson was Fernando Tamagnini de Abreu e Silva, the commander of the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps, which fought with the Allies during World War I. During the Peninsular War, in June 1808, the year after the French invasion of Portugal under General Junot, the Portuguese in the northwest of the country rebelled. French troops led by General Margaron were sent to quell the uprising in Tomar. It was clear that the defence of Tomar would be hopeless and Tamagnini, who knew how to speak French, was asked to act as an intermediary between the city and the French in order to negotiate a peaceful surrender, thereby avoiding potential plundering and other atrocities. She succeeded in avoiding destruction of the city, reducing the reparations expected by the French, and saving the lives of three Portuguese friars who were to be executed. Together with Maria Isabel Wittenhall van Zeller (1749–1819), who was active in the Porto area of Portugal, Tamagnini was a female pioneer in the use of vaccinations against smallpox. Previously the disease had been treated by inoculation, also known as variolation, which involved the deliberate introduction of material from smallpox pustules into the skin. This induced immunity to smallpox but generally also produced a mild form of the infection. Towards the end of the 18th century, the work of Edward Jenner and others showed that cowpox delivered by vaccination to humans could protect against smallpox. Tamagnini ordered everything necessary for the vaccine’s preparation and application from the United Kingdom, and provided it to the Vaccine Institute established in Coimbra by the Royal Academy of Sciences. She, herself, carried out vaccinations in Tomar at her own expense. Tamagnini was appointed a Correspondent of the Vaccine Institute in 1812 but, unlike Wittenhall van Zeller, was not awarded a Gold Medal by the Institute because she failed to provide the necessary data. Death and legacy Tamagnini died in Tomar on 2 July 1827. In Tomar, she is honoured by having one of the city’s major roads named after her.

The seminary was founded in 1951 by Archbishop Ivan Buchko and opened in 1952 in Lure (France). In 1956 it was moved to Castel Gandolfo. The educational management and administration were entrusted to the Ukrainian Salesians. The official name of the Seminary in Lure and in Castel Gandolfo was the \\"Ukrainian Institute of St. John Bosco\\", but more often used is the \\"Ukrainian Minor Seminary of St. John Bosco\\".  History  Ivan Buchko obtained the consent of the General Curia of the Salesian Fathers for the Ukrainian Salesians to take care of the minor seminary. The General Curia agreed and concluded the first agreement, which was signed on November 24, 1951 by Ivan Buchko and Fr. Renato Jijotti, Rector Major of the Salesians. The General Curia appointed two French Salesians to the newly established Seminary: Fr. Laurent D'Heygere, as rector (1951-1953), and his brother, Joseph Kares, as housekeeper, and two Ukrainian Salesians: Fr. Andrés Sapelak as a head teacher, and Fr. Hryhoriy Harasymovych as a clergyman and confessor. In 1956 it was moved to Castel Gandolfo near Rome, and in 1959 the Vatican built a house for the seminary in Rome on the str. Boccea 480. Pope John XXIII awarded the seminary the title of Pontifical (Papal) in 1963. The average number of students was about 50-100, who came from different Western European countries, Yugoslavia and America. The largest number of students (112) studied in 1968-1969. In 1996 the seminary left the premises on the street. Boccea in Rome and moved to a new building in the Salesian community on the street. Prenestino. Later it was ceased to exist in 1999. The Minor Seminary lasted for 48 years: from 1951 to 1999, it educated more than 2,500 Ukrainians from 15 countries in the diaspora and from Ukraine. More that 60 graduates became priests.

Life  Born in Oleśnica Mała, Thiel was born as the son of the trained miller and grain merchant August Thiel and his second wife Regina Thiel, née Gebel. His mother's two brothers, Carl and Ignatz Gebel, worked as principal teachers and choir directors in Ziębice and Parchwitz. Thiel received his first musical instruction from the cantor Scholz of his home parish. He was baptized catholic and grew up in Lower Silesia in simple circumstances. Nevertheless, he was able - just like his brother Reinhold, who was five years younger - to complete training as a primary school teacher. In 1876 he came to the Präparandenschule and afterwards to the in Oppeln. As a junior teacher Thiel taught at a village school in Koszęcin, where he had his own grand piano, and a little later in Zabrze(Mikultschütz). Verein für Regensburger Bistumsgeschichte: Beiträge zur Geschichte des Bistums Regensburg, vol. 2, Verlag des Vereins für Regensburger Bistumsgeschichte (1990), page 672 f. At that time Thiel also played viola. After four and a half years as a teacher and a study leave granted to him in Berlin, he gave up the profession in 1888 and devoted himself to church music.  Musical education  From 1887 to 1892 Thiel studied with Woldemar Bargiel at the Royal Music Institute of Berlin and worked and taught there as organist and choirmaster, initially in the emerging community of . From 1888 to 1891 he was instructed by Heinrich Bellermann in historical musicology and counterpoint. In 1890 Thiel founded the Kirchliche Singschule, a choir consisting of members - mainly teachers - of all Catholic parishes in Berlin. After his studies he was appointed \\"etatmäßiger Hilfslehrer\\" for Gregorian chant at the institute in 1891. Among other things, he devoted himself intensively to the Gregorian chant, because in his opinion, of all music genre, this was best suited to the liturgy. In 1892 he started as a church musician in the parish church St. Sebastian, Berlin in Gesundbrunnen, where he already found a church choir.\\"Carl Thiel\\" in Algemene Muziek-Encyclopedie, Antwerp, Zuid-Nederlandse Uitgeverij (1963) In 1898, the Kirchliche Singschule was renamed to Verein für klassische Kirchenmusik, which consisted of the St. Sebastian choir.

Teaching Activities  After two years of collaboration with his teacher and the director of the Royal Institute of Church Music, Hermann Kretzschmar, Thiel was appointed his representative in 1909. Together with Hermann Kretzschmar he founded the Madrigal Choir of the Academy and appeared several times as its conductor. He had to give up his activity as a church musician in St. Sebastian on 30 June 1910 due to the workload resulting from his teaching activities. He was appointed Professor of Music and, after Hermann Kretzschmar's illness, became Director of the now renamed State Academy for Church Music and School Music from 1922.Institut für Kirchenmusik / Akademie für Kirchen- und Schulmusik 1822-1933, Universität der Künste Berlin, retrieved on 15 June 2020 In the 1920s, Thiel was one of the most important music educators in German musical life.

He held this position voluntarily and held it until the end of his life in 1939. By organizing a commemoration ceremony for Max Reger and a celebration of German culture with Richard Wagner's Parsifal, Anton Bruckner's Te Deum and works by Max Reger, he and his student Theobald Schrems in 1933 strongly supported newer music.

When the system absorbs energy, there is a transition to a higher energy level (excitation), when the system loses energy, there is a transition to a lower energy level. The concept was introduced by Niels Bohr. A quantum jump is a phenomenon that is peculiar to quantum systems and distinguishes them from classical systems, where any transitions are performed gradually. In quantum mechanics, such jumps are associated with the non-unitary evolution of a quantum-mechanical system during measurement. A quantum jump can be accompanied by the emission or absorption of photons; energy transfer during a quantum jump can also occur by non-radiative resonant energy transfer or in collisions with other particles. In modern physics, the concept of a quantum jump is rarely used, as a rule scientists speak of transitions between quantum states or energy levels.  Atomic electron transition  Atomic electron transitions cause the emission or absorption of photons. Their statistics are Poissonian, and the time between jumps is exponentially distributed. The damping time constant (which ranges from nanoseconds to a few seconds) relates to the natural, pressure, and field broadening of spectral lines. The larger the energy separation of the states between which the electron jumps, the shorter the wavelength of the photon emitted.

Tourists are advised to \\"keep expectations low in terms of a clean shopping environment as it can be a little messy in there\\" because \\"most sections of the market are devoted to large-scale, wholesale purchases\\". Retail vendors are located on \\"the first floor of a three-floor building located at the center\\" of the marketplace. \\"The main areas of the JSM include six operating areas, including a seafood operating area, a frozen product operating area, an aquatic products trading hall, a dry goods seasoning operating area, a shell and crab operating area, and a car aquatic products trading area, and a supporting service area. There are about 800 booths.\\" History The JSM banned individual visitors from entering the market since the beginning of the Chinese Spring Festival 2020. \\"At present, the business hours of the merchants are from 4 am to 3 pm, and all are cleared at 3 am. Before the epidemic, the Beijing-Shenzhen Seafood Market had been open 24 hours,\\" said one representative of the market. Clients \\"are called online to pick up the goods\\". During week 20 of 2020, the JSM was shut down due to a new outbreak of COVID-19.

The village has a population of about 80 people. The inhabitants are of the subgroup Mawayana or the Frog people. There are a little over 100 Mawayana Tiriyó in the world. The village is located inside the disputed Tigri Area. History Kasuela is the oldest village of Western Trio Group and is located on an island in the middle of the New River. Camp Jaguar known in Suriname as Camp Tigri is located about four kilometres north of the village. The first settlers were Tiriyó from Kwamalasamutu in Suriname. In 1997, a Wai-wai family from Akotopono joined the village. Overview In 2011, a school was opened in the village. In 2020, the village received access to health care. As of 2018, Kasuela was not connected to the telephone network or internet. The inhabitants are allowed to vote in both the Surinamese elections, as well as the Guyanese elections, however the village did not participate in the 2018 village council elections, because they preferred to choose their leaders in the traditional way. Kasuela can be accessed via the river or by the airstrip located at Camp Jaguar. Language The Mawayana subgroup originally spoke the Mawayana language which has already been replaced by the Tiriyó language. The last two speakers are in Kwamalasamutu as of 2015. The transition to Tiriyó was voluntary and a result of banding together in larger villages. The school has already stated that it will teach the children in the English language.

He is currently Professor of Media, Music and Culture at the University of Leeds. His research focusses on the media and cultural industries, critical approaches to media in the digital age, and the sociology of music. Biography Hesmondhalgh is Professor of Media, Music and Culture at the University of Leeds. His interests include the cultural and creative industries, cultural policy, the politics of musical experience, and how ‘cultural platforms’ are transforming media. He joined the University of Leeds in 2007, having previously worked at The Open University for eight years. He obtained a PhD from Goldsmiths University of London in 1996 for his dissertation on British independent record companies, where he was supervised by Georgina Born. His books include The Cultural Industries, first published in 2002, described by Herbert et al. in their Media Industry Studies as “a formative text for many who began their research careers at the start of the century” and as “extensively updated to keep pace with the new issues developing in an era of social and internet-distributed media”.Herbert, Lotz and Punathambekar, Media Industry Studies (Cambridge: Polity, 2020, p. 4). Oakley and O’Connor describe the same book as “the most comprehensive overview of the literature and issues in the field” of cultural and creative industries.Kate Oakley and Justin O’Connor, The Routledge Companion to the Cultural Industries (London: Routledge, 2015) p. 12. He is acknowledged as a key figure in developing the “cultural industries” approach to media, which emphasises the complex and contradictory nature of cultural production under capitalism.E.g. Aphra Kerr, Global Games (London: Routledge, 2016) p. 4, Anamik Saha, Race and the Cultural Industries (Cambridge: Polity, 2018), p. 25. He is frequently named as one of the leading analysts of cultural labour, partly based on his book Creative Labour, co-written with Sarah Baker.E.g. Mark Banks, Creative Justice: Cultural Industries, Work and Inequality (Oxford: Rowman and Littlefield, 2017, pp. 5, 151) He is also well-known for his work on the sociology of music, especially his book Why Music Matters (2013), which provides a “nuanced case for msuic’s value in contributing to intimate and collective ‘human flourishing’”.David Wilkinson, Post-Punk, Politics and Pleasure in Britain (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), p. 3.

G. Raynaud’s Bibliographie des altfranzösische Liedes, neu bearbeitet und ergänzt. Leiden: Brill, 1955, p.21. As all six of these songs are preserved in the Berne Chansonnier (Bern, Burgerbibliothek, MS 389), which was copied in Metz, and all but one of the songs are only copied there and in other Metz-copied sources, the poet-composer can probably be associated with the musical life of medieval Metz. As the name is likely a nickname or sobriquet (meaning ‘turned backward’ or ‘turned the wrong way’) the individual cannot be traced. Only one song, the more widely copied Or seroit mercis de saison (RS 1894) survives with a melody in the Chansonnier du Roi and the Chansonnier de Noailles, which transmit slightly different versions of the melody.RS numbers refer to the catalogue published in Spanke, Hans. G. Raynaud’s Bibliographie des altfranzösische Liedes, neu bearbeitet und ergänzt. Leiden: Brill, 1955.  Works  The surviving songs include one jeu-parti and one pastourelle. As the Berne songbook was designed for melodies that were never entered, the Oxford chansonnier TrouvI was not designed for musical notation at all, and no melodies were enter for either of the songs in the Saint-Germain-des-Prés chansonnier, TrouvU, the only song for which a melody can be recovered Or seroit mercis de saison (RS 1894) which has been edited by Tischler.Tischler, Hans. Trouvère Lyrics with Melodies: Complete Comparative Edition. Corpus Mensurabilis Musicae. 15 vols Neuhausen: American Institute of Musicology and Hänssler-Verlag, 1997. The jeu-parti is with one ‘Gautier’ for whom several identifications have been proposed including Gautier de Dargies, Gautier de Formeseles, Gautier de Pontis, and Gautier de Bregi.See Arthur Långfors, Recueil Générale des Jeux-Partis Français. Société des anciens texts français. 2 vols. Paris: Champion, 1926, II:195, no.CLI. It appears to be copied incompletely (three stanzas only) between stanzas 3 and 4 of another song (see below). The dilemma posed is whether Gautier would be less pained by catching his beloved lady in a compromising situation with another knight or by seeing his wife give a single kiss to someone that she shouldn’t. Among the songs is the Abecelarius RS 279, which tends to confirm the Lotharingian provenance of the author since the opening word ‘An’ is the dialect spelling of ‘En’ but is needed to start with ‘A’ to make the ABC sequence work (that said, the final stanza spells ‘E!’ as ‘He!’).

Sandhu was commissioned into the Indian Army Armoured Corps in 1953, and participated in the Battle of Asal Uttar during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, and was mentioned in dispatches. He transferred to the Dogra Regiment in 1970, and it was for his performance as commanding officer of the 10th Battalion, Dogra Regiment during an assault on a fortified Pakistan Army position that he was awarded the MVC. He retired as a brigadier and was active in veterans' and gallantry award recipients' matters until his death of colorectal cancer in 2018. Early life and family Narinder Singh Sandhu was born on 1 September 1932 at Narli, Amritsar, in the British province of Punjab, the son of Shri Hari Singh. His grandfather, Thakur Singh, was a major in the British Indian Army in World War I during which he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry; he was subsequently made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. He attended Khalsa College, Amritsar. His wife's name was Harinder, and they had two children: a son, Sandeep; and a daughter, Mandeep; both were born in 1965. Mandeep married Lieutenant General Alok Singh Kler. Sandhu's uncle and younger brother also served with distinction in the Indian Army. Career Sandhu was commissioned into the Indian Army Armoured Corps on 13 December 1953. He served with the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and the 65th Armoured Regiment. He served in the Khemkaran sector during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, during which he participated in the Battle of Asal Uttar on 8–10 September 1965, and his unit was responsible for destroying several Pakistani M47 Patton tanks for which he was mentioned in dispatches. He transferred to the Dogra Regiment in 1970. At the time of the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, he held the rank of lieutenant colonel, commanding the 10th Battalion, Dogra Regiment. As part of Operation Cactus-Lilly, his battalion was tasked to capture an enemy position in the Western Sector, which was located at the eastern end of a bridge over the Ravi River at Dera Baba Nanak. Control of the bridge was considered strategically important because it enabled the Pakistan Army to launch an offensive into India, potentially threatening Pathankot, Beas City and Amritsar. The Pakistan Army had extensively fortified the position with a network of bunkers that were connected by tunnels, and contained machine guns and anti-tank weapons, and it was strongly held. At 17:30 on 5 December 1971, Sandhu led about 420 men of his battalion in the assault, initially mounted on 21 tanks. The tanks became bogged in the marshes along the Ravi River, so they dismounted and made the remaining to the bridge on foot. Surprising the defenders with a charge from , the Indian troops shouted the battle cry \\"Durga Mata Ki Jai\\", invoking the Hindu goddess of war, Durga. Sandhu led the assault with \\"grim determination\\", and without regard for his own safety, and the assault resulted in fierce fighting during which Sandhu fought from bunker to bunker, and was wounded in the leg. Once the position was captured, he then reorganised his troops despite his wound. During the assault the 10th Battalion suffered five killed and ten wounded; 22 Pakistani defenders were killed and 14 were captured. A large quantity of weapons and ammunition was also captured by the Indians. For his actions during this operation, Sandhu was commended by the Indian government for his gallantry, leadership and devotion to duty. He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, the second-highest award for gallantry available to members of the Indian Armed Forces. The award was promulgated on Independence Day in 1972. Sandhu later served as the Deputy Director General of the Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh National Cadet Corps Directorate. He retired from the army as a brigadier, and after retirement was active in veterans' and gallantry award recipients' matters. He died of colon cancer on 30 March 2018, aged 85 in Chandigarh. A contingent from the 3rd Cavalry and Dogra Regiments formed a ceremonial guard at his funeral, which was also attended by several senior military officers.

The annihilation was planned by forced baptism, expulsion and execution by burning. The name derives from a Jewish chronicle called \\"Wiener Gesera\\" and is also used for the events described therein. In Vienna under Duke Albrecht V, the persecution of the Jews in the autumn of 1420 grew to a bloody climax in 1421. In the beginning were many imprisonments, with starvations and tortures leading to executions. Children were deprived and deceived into eating unclean foods, those that were defiant were \\"sold into slavery\\" or baptized against their will.Salo W. Baron, Social and Religious History of the Jews, Volume 10: On the Empire's Periphery, Columbia University Press, 1965, page 420, The poor Jews were driven out, while the wealthy were imprisoned.Viktor Böhm, Jordanhaus - Judenplatz 2 - 1010 Wien Verein für Geschichte und Sozialkunde, accessed 22 May 2007. The few Jews still living in freedom took refuge in the Or-Sarua Synagoge at Judenplatz, in what would become a three-day siege, through hunger and thirst, leading to a collective suicide.Camillo Schaefer, Kammerknechte des Herzogs: Die Judengemeinde im mittelalterlichen Wien - Ein historischer Streifzug Wiener Zeitung, 1 May 1998. A contemporary chronicle exists, entitled the \\"Wiener Geserah\\", translated from German and Hebrew as the \\"Viennese Decree\\". It reported that the Rabbi Jonah set the Synagogue on fire for the Jews at Or- Sarua to die as martyrs. This was a form of Kiddush Hashem in order to escape religious persecution and compulsory baptism.Gerhard Langer, Der Wiener Judenplatz , University of Salzburg: Center for Jewish Culture and History, transcription of a lecture given in 1998 in Vienna. At the command of Duke Albrecht V, the approximately two hundred remaining survivors of the Jewish community were accused of crimes such as dealing arms to the Hussites and host desecration, and on 12 March 1421 were led to the pyre at the so-called goose pasture (Gänseweide) in Erdberg and burned alive. The Duke decided at that time that no more Jews would be allowed in Austria henceforth. The properties that were left behind were confiscated, the houses were sold or given away, and the stones of the synagogue were taken for the building of the old Viennese university. However, Jewish settlement in Vienna would not cease as the Duke intended, and a second major ghetto would emerge in Vienna's Leopoldstadt district in the seventeenth century.Dagmar C. G.

She spend most of her life in Denmark. Family Princess Augusta was born in Copenhagen as the youngest child of Prince William of Hesse, a son of Prince Frederick of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Caroline of Nassau-Usingen and Princess Charlotte of Denmark, a daughter of Hereditary Prince Frederick of Denmark and Norway (1753–1805) and Duchess Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1758–1794). She was thus a niece of king Christian VIII of Denmark. Her sister was Louise of Hesse- Kassel, later Queen of Denmark and mother to King Frederick VIII of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of The United Kingdom, King George I of Greece and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia. Her other siblings included her oldest sister Princess Marie Luise Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel and her only brother Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel (1820-1884), Head of the House of Hesse- Kassel after the death of the last elector of Hesse-Kassel, Frederick William, Elector of Hesse, who died without any legitimate issue. Augustas father, Prince William, who was a minor prince of Hesse-Cassel, had moved to Denmark prior to his marriage to Princess Charlotte and Augusta and her siblings grew up in the Danish royal court and the family became one of the leading families in Danish society.http://img.kb.dk/iti/30/pdf/iti_30_0517.pdf The family became even more important when it became clear that the main line of the Danish royal house faced extinction. Augusta and her siblings were among the closest relatives of King Christian VIII and thus they had a strong claim to the throne. Due to various circumstances it was Augusta's brother-in-law, Christian IX of Denmark, who in the end became king when the main line died out in 1863. Marriage Princess Augusta married the Danish politician and Danish-Swedish nobleman, Carl Frederik Blixen Finecke, baron Blixen-Finecke in 1854. He held the family seat at Näsbyholm Castle in Sweden and Dallund manor in Funen and served as Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1859–1860. The marriage produced two sons. The marriage was regarded with great distress in Augustas family because Carl was married with two children when they fell in love and he divorced his wife to marry Augusta. He was furthermore of much lower rank than Augusta and later his political views were far from the views of her family. He also became a close ally of Countess Louise of Danner, the morganatic spouse of King Frederick VII of Denmark, who was disliked by the other members of the Danish royal family. Augusta and Carl had a very happy marriage despite the obstacles and they were known for their hospitality and lavish lifestyle. As a tribute to Augusta, Carl took the motto \\"Per Angusta ad Augusta,\\" which is latin for \\"through difficulties to honors.\\" Prinsessen og Baronen - Et Kærlighedsdrama (In Danish).

She lived privately at the villa, but she was often visited by the royal family, including emperor Alexander III of Russia, when they stayed at Fredensborg Palace.

Early life  Alf Mattison was born in Hunslet in 1868. He was one of 8 children, his father was a locomotive engineer and his mother worked in the textile trade. At 11 he started work in a wool mill, in his early teens he joined his father at Hunslet Engine Company as an apprentice engineer. His father died in 1890.  Politics  Mattison was exposed to politics from an early age. At 9 he attended a demonstration on Hunslet Moor against the Middleton Railway infringing on common land and in 1881 he was injured by falling through railings when hearing Gladstone speak at Leeds Coloured Cloth Hall. During his time at the Hunslet Engine Company he was involved in a 7 month lockout. He became politically active in his late teens, first joining the Social Democratic Federation in 1884. In 1886 he heard Tom Maguire speaking at Vicars Croft, later befriending Maguire and inspiring Mattison to split from the SDF and joining the newly formed Socialist League. In 1890 he played an active role organising the Leeds Gasworkers strike against Leeds Liberal controlled council, marking a conflict with the Liberals over dominance in both the council and Trades Council. Two years later he helped to found a Leeds branch of the Independent Labour Party, and was a delegate at the party’s inaugural national conference at Bradford in 1893. He remained a member of the party until his death, even after its disaffiliation from the Labour Party in 1932, but became less active in later life. He was also active in the Fabian Society and Labour Church. His involvement in the ILP led to friendships with many notable Socialists of the time including Edward Carpenter, Philip Snowden, Ramsay MacDonald, Isabella Ford, John Lister and Charles Oates.  Local History  Mattison was also a notable local historian, writing regular contributions to the Yorkshire Post and Leeds Weekly Citizen and known as a particular expert on Leeds Labour history and the history of theatre in Leeds. In 1897 he started giving history talks in Hunslet and by 1905 was giving 35 lectures throughout the year. He held office on the Thoresby Society Council from 1908 until his death, during which time he was involved in a campaign for a commemorative plaque to caricaturist Phil May. In 1908 he published “The Romance of Old Leeds” with Walter Deakin. The book contained photos of historical Leeds buildings by Mattison. He kept his own notebooks and clippings, as well as collecting material on Socialist history, including leaflets and literature. In 1929 his collection was bought by Lord Brotherton to be housed at the University of Leeds Library for study. His notebooks were donated to Leeds Public Libraries after his death.  Personal life  Mattison worked at the Hunslet Engine Company until 1906 when he became a clerk at Leeds City Tramways Department. He met Florence “Florrie” Foulds through the Labour Church and they married in 1902. He died on 9 September 1944 when he was knocked down by a tram on Chapeltown Road.

He also became president of the glass bottle makers' union of Fresnes and Escautpont, and in 1900, he represented it at the congress of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). In 1902, various glassworkers' unions affiliated to the CGT founded the Glassworkers' Federation, and Delzant was elected as its first general secretary. He also became editor of its newspaper, La Voix des Verriers, using the position in particular to campaign against harsh conditions for child workers. Delzant was conscripted in 1914, and served in the French Army, describing the conflict as inevitable, and professing no opinion on it beyond that, a position which was strongly criticised by other anarchists. After a short period, he was permitted to transfer to work making steel, but he remained under military discipline until 1918. After World War I, Delzant relaunched the Glassworkers' Federation, with the assistance of Louis Monnier. He became part of the majority in the CGT, not joining its revolutionary split, the United General Confederation of Labour.

Situated on park-like grounds, the old cemetery is one of Germany’s oldest cemeteries that have been abandoned and preserved as a whole. Located close to the Ludwigskirche, it is often mistaken to be part of the neighboring district Herdern. Providing tombs to an estimate of 1200 people, half of them are worthy of preservation. The booster club takes care of maintenance.Im Kampf gegen Verfall und Rost, Hans Sigmund, Badische Zeitung, 7. April 2010 The old cemetery falls under preservation order of cultural and natural monument. Moreover, it can be seen as evidence for death cult, town history and stylistic area of the 17th and 18th century. Serving not only as a place for individual and artistic tombstones of middle class people. Furthermore, the old cemetery grants an insight into the consciousness of faith during the baroque period until the time of neo-classicism.  History  Built in the year of 1683, its original purpose was to replace the destroyed cemetery close to the former St. Nicholas church in the district Vauban. However, since 1515, the cemetery has served as a replacement for the cemetery around Freiburg Minster. Maximilian I, who was a holy Roman emperor, advised the cemetery around Freiburg Minster to be closed out of fear of an epidemic. Nevertheless, it was possible for people to buy burial places next to Freiburg Minster until 1784. Paying a small contribution, under the name “zum Besten des Münsterbaus”, meaning to support the construction, was necessary to obtain a grave. (PDF; 131 kB), Nicole Kemper, Chilli, Freiburger Stadtgeschichten Teil 30, Dezember Januar 2007/2008 Because of fortifications, the cemetery is located outside of the entrenched city. The cemetery was consecrated in 1683. Until 1872, citizens of Freiburg were buried there. The last burial took place on All Saints Day in 1872. After that, burials have taken place in the current main cemetery and in urban cemeteries. In 1711, the old cemetery was expanded for the first time and fourteen years later the St.-Michael’s-ChapelSie ist nicht zu verwechseln mit der alten Michaelskapelle, welche ungefähr an der Stelle des heutigen Siegesdenkmals stand (Hans-Georg Wehrens: Freiburg i. Br.

(the cemetery chapel of the old cemetery Freiburg) was consecrated as the chapel of the cemetery. In 1745, the fortress walls were grinded by French troops. The big cemetery cross is made out of colored sandstone. It was originally placed on the church square of the minster and was transposed to the St.-Michael’s-Chapel in January 1786.Freiburg und seine Bauten, Badischer Architecten- und Ingenieur Verein, Freiburg 1898, 407–414 und Chronikblätter der Stadt Freiburg, Beilage zum Adressbuch (1897), S. 19. This cross has a visual particularity: Instead of the “old Adam’s” skull, which can be found at the foot of many crosses, there’s a skull with an empty eye socket and sparse hair. It has a nail inserted from the left cheekbone to the mouth. There’s a toad made out of stone that is looking out of the skull’s jaw cavity. The skull’s history goes back to an alleged murder which is said to have happened in Freiburg. It tells the story of an old blacksmith who lived near the northward city exit, approximately at the current victory monument. His young wife and the forge journeyman she loved, killed the master smith by hitting a nail in his head. They hid the murder weapon under the hair of the victim. Soon after, they married each other unobstructedly. Due to lack of space, the dead body was disinterred a few years later. A gravedigger found the nail in the skull of which he became aware of through a toad. He reported his finding to the city council resulting in the two murderers being convicted. In 1828 and later in 1859, the cemetery was expanded again. In 1944, the cemetery was damaged heavily because of the bombardments during World War II. So did the Freiburg Danse Macabre, which is located in the front hall of the St.-Michaels-Chapel. On October 28, 1955, it was declared as an extensive natural monument with the protected area number 83110000019.Alter Friedhof, rips On December 26, 1999, Orcan Lothar logged a plane tree which now grows horizontally.

Recorded over two nights at the Austin Opry House in Austin, Texas in January 1979, it was produced by the band's frontman Ray Benson with Chuck Flood, and released on June 11, 1979 as the group's final album on Capitol Nashville. Neither the album nor its sole single, \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\", registered on the US Billboard record charts – the band's first album since 1974 not to do so. Following the release of Collision Course in 1978, several members left Asleep at the Wheel. Served Live is thus the band's first album not to feature founding member LeRoy Preston and original pianist Floyd Domino. It was also the first since their debut not to feature bassist Tony Garnier, and also marked the departures of fiddler Bill Mabry and drummer Chris York. New members on the record were Johnny Nicholas, Spencer Starnes, Daniel J. Menudo and Fran Christina. Background Asleep at the Wheel's first live album was recorded on January 19 and 20, 1979 at the Austin Opry House in Austin, Texas. The recording was facilitated by Manchaca, Texas-based remote recording company Reelsound, with Chuck Flood producing and Hugh Davies engineering. The album was the band's first not to feature founding member LeRoy Preston and original pianist Floyd Domino, both of whom had left the previous year alongside bassist Tony Garnier, fiddler Bill Mabry and drummer Chris York. In the place of the departed members were guitarist Johnny Nicholas, bassist Spencer Starnes, pianist Daniel J. Menudo and drummer Fran Christina. Served Live was released by Capitol Records on June 11, 1979. The album did not register on the official US Billboard charts, although it did reach number 10 on the Record World Country Albums chart, number 57 on the Cash Box Top Country Albums chart, and number 166 on the Cash Box Top Albums chart. The performance of \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\", originally recorded for the band's second album Asleep at the Wheel, was released as the album's only single in June 1979. Reception Contemporary reviews of Served Live were generally positive. Cash Box magazine described the record as \\"another solid package of big band material that could make even the staunchest non-dancer get up and do some toe-tapping and finger-snapping,\\" and as \\"a live album full of energy and spice and lots of sassy horns\\". Similarly, a short review published in Record World magazine noted that \\"The group is well-known for its rousing live performances, and much of that energy is captured here, from the laid-back jazzy treatment ... to the good time honky-tonk mood\\" praising the collection as \\"a nice balance of sound quality and the live presence\\". People magazine claimed that \\"There's a gutsy, loose Friday-Saturday night feel to the album\\", praising the band for \\"demonstrat[ing] a gratifying recognition of their musical heritage\\". Retrospective reviews for Served Live were less positive. Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, his lowest for any of the band's releases to date, writing that \\"Side one is playable, although \\"God Bless the Child\\" was born under a bad sign, and the hot live performances don't suit the living room as well as the more delicate studio versions available on three out of five songs.

False zakomar, which is not repeating the inner shapes of the vault, is called the kokoshnik. Kokoshniks were only made as exterior decorative elements. They were placed on the walls, vaults, as well as the shrinking tiers at the base of the tents and reels of chapters in Church buildings. History In the XII-XVII centuries, zakomars were a typical detail in the ancient Russian Orthodox temple architecture. Quite often, a combination of zakomars and kokoshniks was used in the construction of many temples. The roof in the zakomar covering was arranged directly on the vaults. Depending on the number of vaults, the facade of the Church had the same amount of zakomars. By the XVII century, a significant number of Russian temples had the zakomar covering. But sophisticated curvilinear rooftop was not very practical—the snow and rain accumulated on it, causing leaks. By the end of the XVII century, the Baroque era came to the Russian architecture, making the zakomars and zakomar coverings a thing of the past. In the XVIII-XIX centuries, zakomar coverings were replaced with four-pitched roofs in many temples. Because of the spread of the retrospective trends in the Russian Empire’s architecture, zakomars reappeared in the Church buildings. At the end of the XX century, the revival of the zakomar covering has occurred. It was due to the appearance of construction technology, which created rain and snow resistant zakomar coverings. Therefore, the new Uspensky Cathedral in Yaroslavl has the zakomar covering.

He attended Nigerian Law School and was subsequently called to the Nigerian Bar as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Ajana's legal career started at the Kwara State Ministry of Justice where he served as State Counsel (1982-1984). In 1984, he established his own private firm, Nasiru Ajana & Co in Okene until 1989 when he was appointed a Judge of Kwara State High Court. He was transferred to Kogi State after its creation in 1991. Prior to his appointment as Chief Judge of Kogi State, Ajana had served in different capacities. In 1994, Ajana served on the Kabba disturbance tribunal in Kogi State as Chairman. Ajana was Chairman, Election petition tribunal in Adamawa State for the 1998 general elections; Member, Governing board of Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (1999-2006); Chairman, Panel on Muritala Mohammed International Airport Fire Incidence (2000); Chairman, Election petition Tribunal in Akwa – Ibom State (2007) and Chairman; Election Tribunal Petition (2) in Rivers State (2008). In early 2018, the executive and legislative arm of government in Kogi State commenced a move to remove Ajana from office for an alleged gross misconduct. The State House of Assembly had passed a resolution recommending that the governor remove Ajana from office. Ajana however approached a High Court in Koton Karfe, for an interpretation of the constitution on whether the State House of Assembly and the governor could sack the Chief Judge of the state from office. The court ruled that the Legislature acting jointly with the Executive or unilaterally lacks the powers to remove the Chief Judge of the state without recourse to National Judicial Council (NJC). The Judge in his ruling further stated that \\"It was an audacious and arbitrary display of naked power, an act that is contrary to all constitutional and democratic tenets.\\" Death Ajanah died of COVID-19 at a COVID isolation centre, in Gwagwalada on 28 June 2020.

Early life and education Born in 1922, Tate learned the value of education early on from his mother, not just as a means of personal growth, but as a way to combat oppression. He quoted her as saying \\"If you become a man of thought and learning, may you never fail with your right hand to tear down what your left hand has built up through years of thought and study if you see it not to be founded on that which is [true].\\" Tate would go on to attend Fort Valley State University, graduating at the age of 20, with a degree in Education. Later, he would become the first African-American to earn a PhD from the University of Kentucky. Career Tate's career started soon after he received his undergraduate degree, as principal of two schools in Georgia, the first in Union Point, the second in Greensboro. He was the first African-American to run for mayor of Atlanta, GA, though unsuccessfully. He served as the chief executive of the Georgia Teachers and Education Association, soon after it became integrated. Then he became the first executive director of the Georgia Association of Educators, and a leader in the teacher’s union. Much of his work involved uniting the efforts of both black and white teachers toward providing equal resources to all children in the state. In 1974, Tate was elected to serve in the Georgia State Senate, district 38, a position he held for 16 years. His focus in the legislature, as it had been his whole career, was to promote educational equity and protect voting rights. Legacy Something of an unsung hero in the story of U.S. Civil Rights, much of what Tate accomplished has been documented by education scholar Vanessa Siddle Walker, in whom Tate confided toward the end of his life. He is also the father of two children retired college professor Veloisa Tate and Georgia State Senator Horacena Tate, who currently holds his former seat, representing the 38th District in Fulton County, Georgia. He has one grandchild, Merisa T. Marsh who followed in his footsteps as an educator and serves as a principal in New Orleans and one grandchild Kennedy Marsh.

He was the founder of Kemna Bau.  Biography = Early life  Julius Kemna was born the only son of Johann Abraham Kemna and Carolina Wilhelmina (Wilhelmine) van Hees on December 8, 1837 in Barmen. The family of Johann Abraham Kemna, a wine wholesaler from Barmen and Royal Prussian purveyor to the court (1810–1878), can be traced back to the 15th century, where they lived in the Kemna manor. Kemna's mother, Carolina Wilhelmina van Hees (1814-1880), was the niece of the well known Barmer school founder Susanna Sophia Antoinetta van Hees and granddaughter of the first pharmacist in Barmen Johann Hermann von Hees .We may conclude from this information, that Kemna associated with people of highest social standing from childhood and was therefore able to establish beneficial contacts for himself and his future company accordingly. It is also probable, that Kemna felt encouraged to step out of the shadow of his illustrious parents and prove himself due to this. Julius Kemna moved from Barmen to Silesia at a young age and initially worked in agriculture. In 1867, Kemna founded a workshop for \\"the construction of agricultural machinery\\". Kemna married Philippine Lübbert (1847-1921), who grew up in Zweibrodt palace and was the daughter of merchant August Friedrich Lübbert and sister of Eduard Lübbert (well-known classical philologist and archaeologist), in Wroclaw 1870. Philippine Kemna bore 3 sons, one of them Erich Kemna.  The company's ascent  After the end of the 1870/1871 war, Kemna believed the time had come to bring steam plows to German agriculture in large numbers, achieving his desire by acquiring English steam plow etchers and making them known to landowners through contract plowing. This Practical experience led Kemna's company to free himself more and more from English producers and become a self-sufficient entity. One of the first steps in this process was to make the plows for the locomotives sourced from abroad (which means that Kemna adapted its plows to these locomotives and thus also became successful on the international stage). In 1882, Kemna started producing road construction machines and other steam engines. In the course of the next years, in which the production of steam road rollers made rapid progress, the construction of chopping machines for high-power drives was initiated, which became one of the primary production sectors within Kemna.  Death and legacy  Julius Kemna died in the year of 1898 and bequeathed 30 marks to his employees for each year of service; enough money for many to build a house. Kemna recognized that the steam engine was revolutionary for industry as well as for agriculture and road construction. His many years of experience with English steam plow systems supported his company's upswing. He is considered a \\"pioneer in agriculture and machine construction.\\" Following Julius Kemnas death, the company developed into a large-scale industrial enterprise at the turn of the century. Due to capacity expansions, about 900 workers were employed on a 52,000 m2 industrial site in 1905. At the beginning of the 20th century, Julius Kemna's company became \\"the leading steam plough company on the European continent and invaded the monopoly position of English companies on the world market\\". In 1923, Kemna's company became the first company in Germany to launch a road roller with a crude oil engine (Deutz diesel engine).

Prehistoric Egypt  * Underground mining – Khater-4 site which is 33,000 years old is the oldest evidence of underground mining in the history of the world. * Preserving food by smoking existed during the Mesolithic period (20,000 BC.) in Egypt. * Swimming – The oldest known swimming scenes are found in the Cave of swimmers. * Warfare – The earliest evidence of violence and tribal wars is Site 117.Keeley, Lawrence H: War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage. p. 37. Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago,Diamond, Jared, Guns, Germs and Steel Warfare between Predynastic city states and the wars of the unification of Egypt started as early as 3800 BC. * Early planting appeared in Egypt as early as Qadan culture (13,000 B.C. – 10,000 B.C.).Darvill, T: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology, Copyright 2002, 2003 by Oxford University Press.

Ancient Egypt = Government and Economy  * Monarchy - In Predynastic Egypt each nome had its own monarch. Upon, the unification of Egypt King Narmer became the world's first undisputed monarch. Narmer Palette depicting king Narmer defeating the king of the north and in front of him the nomarchs with holding the standard of each nome. * Government – Upon the Unification of Egypt, King Narmer began forming the governmental system of his realm, which would stay nearly the same throughout the dynastic history. * Taxation – Taxation in Egypt started during the reign of king Iry-Hor and perhaps as early as Scorpion I. * Peace treaty – The Earliest recorded peace treaty in the history of the world that survived to modern days was signed between the pharaoh Ramesses II and the Hittite king Muwatalli II after the Battle of Kadesh (1274B.C.). * Women's rights - In ancient Egypt, women enjoyed the same rights under the law as a man, however rightful entitlements depended upon social class. Landed property descended in the female line from mother to daughter, and women were entitled to administer their own property. Women in ancient Egypt could buy, sell, be a partner in legal contracts, be executor in wills and witness to legal documents, bring court action, and adopt children. Tablet of one of the earliest recorded treaties in history, Treaty of Kadesh, at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum * Law – Ancient Egyptian law, dating as far back as 3000 BC, was based on the concept of Ma'at and characterised by tradition, rhetorical speech, social equality and impartiality.VerSteeg, Law in ancient Egypt * Flag or Emblem – As early as the Predynastic times, each nome had its own standard.Flag  heraldry.

Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, ; page 117 * Religious war and Rebellion – Khasekhemwy managed to reunite Upper and Lower Egypt after a civil war between the followers of the gods Horus and Set.P.E. Newberry, * Community banking models - Community banking is a non-traditional form of money-lending. Unlike banks or other classic lending institutions, the funds that community banks lend to borrowers are gathered by the local community itself. This tends to mean that the individuals in a neighborhood or group have more control over who is receiving the capital and how that capital is being spent. This practice has existed in some form for centuries; in ancient Egypt, for example, when grain was often used as currency, local granaries would store and distribute the community's food supply. Since that time, a variety of community banking models have evolved. * Police – In ancient Egypt evidence of law enforcement exists as far back as the Old Kingdom period. There are records of an office known as \\"Judge Commandant of the Police\\" dating to the fourth dynasty. During the fifth dynasty at the end of the Old Kingdom period, officers armed with wooden sticks were tasked with guarding public places such as markets, temples, and parks, and apprehending criminals. They are known to have made use of trained monkeys, baboons, and dogs in guard duties and catching criminals. After the Old Kingdom collapsed, ushering in the First Intermediate Period, it is thought that the same model applied. During this period, Bedouins were hired to guard the borders and protect trade caravans. During the Middle Kingdom period, a professional police force was created with a specific focus on enforcing the law, as opposed to the previous informal arrangement of using warriors as police. The police force was further reformed during the New Kingdom period. * Mail and Postal Systems – The practice of communication by written documents carried by an intermediary from one person or place to another almost certainly dates back nearly to the invention of writing. However, the development of formal postal systems occurred much later. The first documented use of an organized courier service for the dissemination of written documents is in Egypt, where Pharaohs used couriers for the dissemination of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BCE). The earliest surviving piece of mail is also Egyptian, dating to 255 BCE.Universal Postal Union. \\"History\\". Accessed 2 October 2013. * Schools and Organized Education – Organized education began in Ancient Egypt as early as 3000 BC. Kids would join school at the age of 7. Girls, however didn't go to schools usually. Instead, they used to learn in their homes like modern-day Homeschooling.  Warfare  * Standing Army – Continuous warfare led to the establishment of a Standing Army dating back to at least the Middle Kingdom. * Military organization - As early as the Old Kingdom (c.2686-2160 BC) Egypt used specific military units, with military hierarchy appearing in the Middle Kingdom (c.2055–1650 BC).Darnell, John Colemen; Menassa, Colleen.

String of beads; 3300–3100 BC; carnelian, garnet, quartz and glazed steatite; length: 20.5 cm; by Naqada III culture Metropolitan Museum of Art. * Soapstone or Steatite was used in Egypt as early as Naqada III period. * Turquoise – Turquoise was mined in Egypt Since at least the First Dynasty (3000 BCE), and possibly before then, turquoise was used by the Egyptians and was mined by them in the Sinai Peninsula. This region was known as the Country of Turquoise by the native Monitu. * Wattle and daub – Wattle and daub was used in Egypt as early as the Merimde culture. * Lime mortar - Lime mortar was invented by Ancient Egyptians before the Old Kingdom and was used in the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza. * Egyptian Alabaster - Alabaster (Egyptian alabaster) was discovered and used abundantly in ancient times. * Amethyst a form of Quartz was first used by the Ancient Egyptians.Augosto Castellani (famous Italian 19th century jeweler) (1871), Gems, Notes and Extracts, p. 34, London, Bell and Daldy, . * Malachite – Ancient Egyptians mined malachite at Maadi as early as the Old Kingdom.Shaw, I. (2000). The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 57–59. * Electrum – Electrum was used as early as the third millennium BC in Old Kingdom of Egypt, sometimes as an exterior coating to the pyramidions atop ancient Egyptian pyramids and obelisks. It was also used in the making of ancient drinking vessels. * Other Than that, The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use gold (4000 BC.)Sutherland, C.H.V, Gold (London, Thames & Hudson, 1959) p 27 ff. and Lead (3800 BC.) abundantly.  Medicine  Discoveries = * Intracranial Pulsations * Meninges * Cerebrospinal fluid * Paralysis * Urinary incontinence - The management of urinary incontinence with pads is mentioned in the earliest medical book known, the Ebers Papyrus (1500 BC). * Anatomy - In 1600 BCE, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, an Ancient Egyptian medical text, described the heart, its vessels, liver, spleen, kidneys, hypothalamus, uterus and bladder, and showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart. The Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE) features a \\"treatise on the heart\\", with vessels carrying all the body's fluids to or from every member of the body. * Circulatory system - The earliest known writings on the circulatory system are found in the Ebers Papyrus (16th century BCE), an ancient Egyptian medical papyrus containing over 700 prescriptions and remedies, both physical and spiritual. In the papyrus, it acknowledges the connection of the heart to the arteries. The Egyptians thought air came in through the mouth and into the lungs and heart. From the heart, the air travelled to every member through the arteries. Although this concept of the circulatory system is only partially correct, it represents one of the earliest accounts of scientific thought. * Cataract - Cataract was known in Ancient Egypt from at least the Fifth Dynasty. * Cancer - The earliest written record regarding cancer is from circa 1600 BC in the Egyptian Edwin Smith Papyrus and describes breast cancer. * Diabetes - Diabetes was one of the first diseases described, with an Egyptian manuscript from 1500 BCE mentioning \\"too great emptying of the urine.\\" The Ebers papyrus includes a recommendation for a drink to take in such cases. The first described cases are believed to have been type 1 diabetes. * Dracunculiasis or Guinea-worm disease and its treatment - The Ebers Papyrus says that the cure to the Guinea-Worm disease is to wrap the emerging end of the worm around a stick and slowly pull it out. 3,500 years later, this remains the standard treatment. * Dementia - Mentioned in the Ebers papyrus. * Depression - Mentioned in the Ebers papyrus. * Hysteria - The oldest record of hysteria dates back to 1900 B.C. when Egyptians recorded behavioral abnormalities in adult women on medical papyrus. The Egyptians attributed the behavioral disturbances to a wandering uterus—thus later dubbing the condition hysteria. To treat hysteria Egyptian doctors prescribed various medications. For example, doctors put strong smelling substances on the patients’ vulvas to encourage the uterus to return to its proper position. Another tactic was to smell or swallow unsavory herbs to encourage the uterus to flee back to the lower part of the female’s stomach. * Hematuria - One of the main symptoms of Bilharzia was known and treated by the Ancient Egyptians. * Baldness - The Ebers papyrus contain several remedies to cure hair loss. * Colorectal surgery - The Chester Beatty Medical Papyrus, is one of the extant medical papyri, from ancient Egypt. It is dedicated to magical incantations against headaches and remedies for anorectal ailments, From the title (text not accessed). and is dated around 1200 BC. = Inventions = Prosthetic toe from ancient Egypt * Pharmacopoeia - Pharmacopoeia is a book that contains a group of remedies and identifications of the compounds used in medicines. The text which can be called a Pharmacopoeia is the Edwin Smith Papyrus. * Poultice * Splint Inscription detailing ancient Egyptian medical instruments, including bone saws, suction cups, knives and scalpels, retractors, scales, lances, chisels and dental tools. * Bandage - The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use adhesive bandages and were also the first to treat wounds with Honey. * Prosthesis - Prosthetics appeared circa 3,000 BC. with the earliest evidence of prosthetics appearing in ancient Egypt and Iran. The earliest recorded mention of eye prosthetics is from the Egyptian story of the Eye of Horus dates circa 3000 BC, which involves the left eye of Horus being plucked out and then restored by Thoth. The Egyptians were also early pioneers of foot prosthetics, as shown by the wooden toe found on a body from the New Kingdom circa 1000 BC. * Cauterization - Cauterization has been used to stop heavy bleeding since antiquity. The process was described in the Edwin Smith Papyrus * Surgical instruments - The oldest metal (Bronze or copper) surgical tools in the world were discovered in the tomb of Qar. * Scalpel * Bone cutter * Suction cups * Retractor * Syringe * Forceps * Sponge Phials * Clamps - Used to stop blood flow. * Toothpaste and Toothbrush - Since 5000 BC, the Egyptians made a tooth powder, which consisted of powdered ashes of ox hooves, myrrh, powdered and burnt eggshells, and pumice. * Breath mint = Innovations = * Gynaecology - The Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus, dated to about 1800 BC, deals with women's health gynaecological diseases, fertility, pregnancy, contraception, etc. Treatments are non surgical, comprising applying medicines to the affected body part or swallowing them. The womb is at times seen as the source of complaints manifesting themselves in other body parts.Laurinda S. Dixon. Perilous Chastity: Women and Illness in Pre-Enlightenment Art and Medicine, Cornell University Press 1995, pp.15f. * Pregnancy test - The ancient Egyptians watered bags of wheat and barley with the urine of a possibly pregnant woman. Germination indicated pregnancy. The type of grain that sprouted was taken as an indicator of the fetus's sex. * Birth control - The Egyptian Ebers Papyrus from 1550 BC and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850 BC have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control: the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm. * Rhinoplasty - Treatments for the plastic repair of a broken nose are first mentioned in the Edwin Smith Papyrus, a transcription of text dated to the Old Kingdom from 3000 to 2500 BCE. * Surgical suture - The earliest reports of surgical suture date to 3000 BC in ancient Egypt, and the oldest known suture is in a mummy from 1100 BC. * Ophthalmology - In the Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt dating to 1550 BC, a section is devoted to eye diseases.  Mathematics  Algebra = * Numeral system - Written evidence of the use of mathematics dates back to at least 3200 BC with the ivory labels found in Tomb U-j at Abydos. These labels appear to have been used as tags for grave goods and some are inscribed with numbers. Further evidence of the use of the base 10 number system can be found on the Narmer Macehead which depicts offerings of 400,000 oxen, 1,422,000 goats and 120,000 prisoners. * Base-10 numeral system Arithmetic values thought to have been represented by parts of the Eye of Horus * Binary - The method used for ancient Egyptian multiplication is also closely related to binary numbers. In this method, multiplying one number by a second is performed by a sequence of steps in which a value (initially the first of the two numbers) is either doubled or has the first number added back into it; the order in which these steps are to be performed is given by the binary representation of the second number. This method can be seen in use, for instance, in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, which dates to around 1650 BC.. * Fraction and Arithmetics with fractions - The earliest fractions were reciprocals of integers: ancient symbols representing one part of two, one part of three, one part of four, and so on. The Egyptians used Egyptian fractions . About 4000 years ago, Egyptians divided with fractions using slightly different methods. They used least common multiples with unit fractions. Their methods gave the same answer as modern methods. See for examples and an explanation. * Dyadic rational - The Egyptians also had a different notation for dyadic fractions in the Akhmim Wooden Tablet and several Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problems. * X (Unknown) * Quadratic equation - The ancient Egyptians were the first civilization to develop and solve second-degree (quadratic) equations. This information is found in the Berlin Papyrus fragment. Additionally, the Egyptians solve first-degree algebraic equations found in Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. * Pefsu problem (modern day: Arithmetic mean) * Multiplication * Division * Exponentiation (Power of two) - The ancient Egyptians had laid out tables of a great number of powers of two, rather than recalculating them each time. The decomposition of a number thus consists of finding the powers of two which make it up. The Egyptians knew empirically that a given power of two would only appear once in a number. * Regula falsi - The simple false position technique is found in papyri from ancient Egyptian mathematics.Jean-Luc Chabert, ed., A History of Algorithms: From the Pebble to the Microchip (Berlin: Springer, 1999), pp. 86-91. * Square root - The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is a copy from 1650 BC of an earlier Berlin Papyrus and other textspossibly the Kahun Papyrusthat shows how the Egyptians extracted square roots by an inverse proportion method.Anglin, W.S. (1994). Mathematics: A Concise History and Philosophy. New York: Springer-Verlag. * 0 - By 1770 BC, the Egyptians had a symbol for zero in accounting texts. The symbol nfr, meaning beautiful, was also used to indicate the base level in drawings of tombs and pyramids and distances were measured relative to the base line as being above or below this line. * Plus and minus signs - The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for addition resembled a pair of legs walking in the direction in which the text was written (Egyptian could be written either from right to left or left to right), with the reverse sign indicating subtraction: { align=\\"center\\" D54 or D55 } * Pi - Based on the measurements of the Great Pyramid of Giza , some Egyptologists have claimed that the ancient Egyptians used an approximation of as from as early as the Old Kingdom.Petrie, W.M.F. Wisdom of the Egyptians (1940)Verner, Miroslav. The Pyramids: The Mystery, Culture, and Science of Egypt's Great Monuments. Grove Press. 2001 (1997). The Rhind Papyrus, dated around 1650 BC but copied from a document dated to 1850 BC, has a formula for the area of a circle that treats as 3.16. * The Golden number * arithmetic progression - Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problem number 40. * Conversion of units - Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problem number 42. * Seked (Modern day Slope) - Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problem number 56. * Trigonometry and Trigonometric functions - Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problem number 56.

Princeton University Press. p. 20. . * Red auxiliary number = Areas and Volumes = * Area of Triangle - Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problem number 51. * Area of Circle * Area of Trapezoid - Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problem number 52. * Surface area of Sphere - The Tenth problem of the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus asks for a calculation of the surface area of a hemisphere (Struve, Gillings) or possibly the area of a semi-cylinder (Peet). Below we assume that the problem refers to the area of a hemisphere.Williams, Scott W. Egyptian Mathematical Papyri * Volume of Cylinder - Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problem number 41. * Volume of Prism - Rhind Mathematical Papyrus problem number 46. * Volume of Pyramid * Volume of Frustum - The 14th problem of the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus calculates the volume of a frustum. Problem 14 states that a pyramid has been truncated in such a way that the top area is a square of length 2 units, the bottom a square of length 4 units, and the height 6 units, as shown. The volume is found to be 56 cubic units, which is correct.Clagett, Marshall. 1999. Ancient Egyptian Science: A Source Book. Volume 3: Ancient Egyptian Mathematics. Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society 232. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society. = Measurement = * System of measurement and Metrology- Ancient Egypt was one of the first civilization to have system of measurement. The Ancient Egyptian measuring system contained measuring units for: * Length – Egyptian units of length are attested from the Early Dynastic Period. Although it dates to the 5th dynasty, the Palermo stone recorded the level of the Nile River during the reign of the Early Dynastic pharaoh Djer, when the height of the Nile was recorded as 6 cubits and 1 palm (about ). A 3rd-dynasty diagram shows how to construct an elliptical vault using simple measures along an arc. The ostracon depicting this diagram was found near the Step Pyramid of Saqqara. A curve is divided into five sections and the height of the curve is given in cubits, palms, and digits in each of the sections. Cubit rod from the Turin Museum. * Area - Records of land area also date to the Early Dynastic Period. The Palermo stone records grants of land expressed in terms of kha and setat. Mathematical papyri also include units of land area in their problems. For example, several problems in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus give the area of rectangular plots of land in terms of setat and the ratio of the sides and then require the scribe to solve for their exact lengths. * Volume * Weight – Weighs were known since the Old Kingdom and perhaps as early as the Early Dynastic Period. Weights were measured in terms of deben. This unit would have been equivalent to 13.6 grams in the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom. During the New Kingdom however it was equivalent to 91 grams. For smaller amounts the qedet ( of a deben) and the shematy ( of a deben) were used.  Science  * Geology - The earliest detailed map known in the world from the Turin Papyrus dating to Ramesside Period about 1160 BCE, shows the route to the gold mines in the Wadi Hammamat, Eastern Desert. * Topography - Besides being a Geological map of surprisingly modern aspect, the Turin Papyrus is also a topographic map (the earliest known) because it accurately shows the local distribution of different rock types (with black and pink hills), the lithologically diverse wadi gravels (with brown, green and white dots), and it contains information on quarrying and mining. The draughtsman clearly and carefully distributed distinctive features in accordance with the reality of a particular area, adding clarity by the use of legends and contrasting colors. In this respect, the Turin Papyrus may be regarded as the earliest known Geographic Information System.Harrell, James A. \\"Turin Papyrus Map from Ancient Egypt\\", Research on the Archaeological Geology of Ancient Egypt, Accessed Feb 24, 2018, http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/Egypt/Turin%20Papyrus/Harrell_Papyrus_Map_text.htm.McMahon, David M., \\"The Turin Papyrus Map The Oldest Known Map with Geological Significance\\", Earth Sciences History 11 no. 1 (1992): 9–12. *Carmeni, U., \\"La Mappa delle Miniere del Museo Egizio di Torino.

They rose consecutively on the horizon throughout each earth rotation. The rising of each decan marked the beginning of a new decanal \\"hour\\" (Greek hōra) of the night for the ancient Egyptians, and they were used as a sidereal star clock beginning by at least the 9th or 10th Dynasty (c. 2100 BCE). * The discovery of Algol - An Ancient Egyptian Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days composed some 3,200 years ago is claimed to be the oldest historical document of the discovery of Algol. * Sothic cycle * Calendar * Star clock * solstice and Equinox  Tools and machines  * Core drill – The earliest core drills were those used by the ancient Egyptians, invented in 3000 BC. * Dock - The earliest known docks were those discovered in Wadi al-Jarf, an ancient Egyptian harbor, of Pharaoh Khufu, dating from c.2500 BC located on the Red Sea coast. Archaeologists also discovered anchors and storage jars near the site. * Herodotus Machine – The Herodotus Machine was a machine described by Herodotus, a Greek historian. Herodotus claims this invention enabled the Ancient Egyptians to construct the pyramids. The contraption supposedly allowed workers to lift heavy building materials. Herodotus is believed to have encountered the device while traveling through Egypt. With limited reference and no true schematics, this machine has stimulated many historians' theories of how the Ancient Egyptians were able to create pyramids. * Lever – Levers (as machines used in lifting heavy weights) were invented in Ancient Egypt. In ancient Egypt technology, workmen used the lever to move and uplift obelisks weighing more than 100 tons. This is evident from the recesses in the large blocks and the handling bosses which could not be used for any purpose other than for levers. * Loom - Looms were used in ancient Egypt as early as 4400 BC, a foot pedal was used for the earliest horizontal frame loom. Papyrus (P. BM EA 10591 recto column IX, beginning of lines 13–17) * Papyrus Paper – Papyrus paper was first manufactured in Egypt as far back as the fourth millennium BCE.Houston, Keith, The Book: A Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of our Time, W.

The earliest archaeological evidence of papyrus was excavated in 2012 and 2013 at Wadi al-Jarf, an ancient Egyptian harbor located on the Red Sea coast. These documents, the Diary of Merer, date from c. 2560–2550 BCE (end of the reign of Khufu). The papyrus rolls describe the last years of building the Great Pyramid of Giza. * Ink – Ink was used in Ancient Egypt for writing and drawing on papyrus from at least the 26th century BC. * Pulley – The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Ancient Egypt in the Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BCE) vizier Khay copied onto a limestone ostracon, in Egyptian Hieratic * Rope stretcher - a rope stretcher (or harpedonaptai) was a surveyor who measured real property demarcations and foundations using knotted cords, stretched so the rope did not sag.

World's oldest sundial, from Egypt's Valley of the Kings (c. 1500 BC) * Sundials - The earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are shadow clocks (1500 BC or BCE) from ancient Egyptian astronomy. * Water clock – The oldest water clock of which there is physical evidence dates to c. 1417–1379 BC, during the reign of Amenhotep III where it was used in the Temple of Amen-Re at Karnak., pp. 59–61 The oldest documentation of the water clock is the tomb inscription of the 16th century BC Egyptian court official Amenemhet, which identifies him as its inventor. * Wig - In Egyptian society men and women commonly had clean shaven or close cropped hair and often wore wigs. The ancient Egyptians created the wig to shield shaved, hairless heads from the sun. They also wore the wigs on top of their hair using beeswax and resin to keep the wigs in place. Wealthy Egyptians would wear elaborate wigs and scented cones of animal fat on top of their wigs. * Ramps and Inclined planes – The Egyptian pyramids were constructed using inclined planes, False door of Nykara, c. 2408 BC, painted limestone, 168 x 111.5 × 6 cm, Cleveland Museum of Art * Parchment - Writing on prepared animal skins had a long history, however. David Diringer noted that \\"the first mention of Egyptian documents written on leather goes back to the Fourth Dynasty (c. 2550–2450 BC), but the earliest of such documents extant are: a fragmentary roll of leather of the Sixth Dynasty (c. 24th century BC), unrolled by Dr. H. Ibscher, and preserved in the Cairo Museum; a roll of the Twelfth Dynasty (c. 1990–1777 BC) now in Berlin; the mathematical text now in the British Museum (MS. 10250); and a document of the reign of Ramses II (early thirteenth century BC).\\"David Diringer, The Book before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental, Dover Publications, New York 1982, p. 172. * Doors and Door Locks – The earliest in records are those represented in the paintings of some Egyptian tombs, in which they are shown as single or double doors, each in a single piece of wood. Doors were once believed to be the literal doorway to the afterlife, and some doors leading to important places included designs of the afterlife. * Combs * Bellows – Bellows were used as early as the New Kingdom. * Air conditioning – The basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water. The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. * Hand fan – Hand fans had been used in Egypt as early as 4,000 years ago. Hand fans have been ound in King Tut's tomb. Deshret, the Red Crown of Lower Egypt * Pens and Reed pens - Ancient Egyptians had developed writing on papyrus scrolls when scribes used thin reed brushes or reed pens from the Juncus maritimus or sea rush.Egyptian reed pen Retrieved March 16, 2007. In his book A History of Writing, Steven Roger Fischer suggests that on the basis of finds at Saqqara, the reed pen might well have been used for writing on parchment as long ago as the First Dynasty or about 3000 BC. * Spoon - Preserved examples of various forms of spoons used by the ancient Egyptians include those composed of ivory, flint, slate and wood; many of them carved with religious symbols.\\"Spoon.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, 1911.

The first records of a water screw, or screw pump, date back to Ancient Egypt before the 3rd century BC. The Egyptian screw, used to lift water from the Nile, was composed of tubes wound round a cylinder; as the entire unit rotates, water is lifted within the spiral tube to the higher elevation. A later screw pump design from Egypt had a spiral groove cut on the outside of a solid wooden cylinder and then the cylinder was covered by boards or sheets of metal closely covering the surfaces between the grooves. * Screw pump - The screw pump is the oldest positive displacement pump. The first records of a water screw, or screw pump, dates back to Ancient Egypt before the 3rd century BC. The Egyptian screw, used to lift water from the Nile, was composed of tubes wound round a cylinder; as the entire unit rotates, water is lifted within the spiral tube to the higher elevation. A later screw pump design from Egypt had a spiral groove cut on the outside of a solid wooden cylinder and then the cylinder was covered by boards or sheets of metal closely covering the surfaces between the grooves. = Furniture = Furniture became common first in Ancient Egypt during the Naqada culture. During that period a wide variety of furniture pieces were invented and used. * Tables - Some very early tables were made and used by the Ancient Egyptianshttps://study.com/academy/lesson/ancient-egyptian-furniture-history- design.html around 2500 BC, using wood and alabaster. They were often little more than stone platforms used to keep objects off the floor, though a few examples of wooden tables have been found in tombs. Food and drinks were usually put on large plates deposed on a pedestal for eating. The Egyptians made use of various small tables and elevated playing boards. * Chairs - Chairs were in existence since at least the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt (c. 3100 BC). They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today's chairs – chair seats were sometimes only high. * Bed - The Egyptians had high bedsteads which were ascended by steps, with bolsters or pillows, and curtains to hang around. The elite of Egyptian society such as its pharaohs and queens even had beds made of wood, sometimes gilded. Often there was a head-rest as well, semi-cylindrical and made of stone, wood, or metal.  Arts and Architecture  Architecture = * Mastaba – Was a predecessor to the Egyptian pyramid. Kings of the Early Dynastic Period were buried there. Columns with Hathoric capitals * Column – In ancient Egyptian architecture as early as 2600 BC, the architect Imhotep made use of stone columns whose surface was carved to reflect the organic form of bundled reeds, like papyrus, lotus and palm. In later Egyptian architecture faceted cylinders were also common. Their form is thought to derive from archaic reed-built shrines. Carved from stone, the columns were highly decorated with carved and painted hieroglyphs, texts, ritual imagery and natural motifs. Egyptian columns are famously present in the Great Hypostyle Hall of Karnak (circa 1224 BC), where 134 columns are lined up in sixteen rows, with some columns reaching heights of 24 metres. Pylon of the Temple of Luxor with the remaining obelisk (of two) in front (the second is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris). * Hypostyle Architecture * Capital – The two earliest Egyptian capitals of importance are those based on the lotus and papyrus plants. * Pylon – Pylons were often decorated with scenes emphasizing a king's authority since it was the public face of a cult building. Toby Wilkinson, The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson, 2005. p.195 On the first pylon of the temple of Isis at Philae, the pharaoh is shown slaying his enemies while Isis, Horus and Hathor look on. Other examples of pylons can be seen in Karnak, Luxor, and Edfu. * Obelisk – The earliest temple obelisk still in its original position is the red granite Obelisk of Senusret I of the XIIth Dynasty at Al-Matariyyah in modern Heliopolis. Illustrations of various examples of ancient Egyptian cornices, all of them having cavettos * Gardens – Gardens appeared in Egypt during the Old Kingdom. There were many types of gardens in Ancient Egypt such as: pleasure gardens, Palace gardens, Temple gardens and Funerary gardens.Descroches-Noblecourt, L’Art Egyptien, pg. 113 * Cavetto – Ancient Egyptian architecture made special use of large cavetto mouldings as a cornice, with only a short fillet (plain vertical face) above, and a torus moulding (convex semi-circle) below. This cavetto cornice is sometimes also known as an \\"Egyptian cornice\\", \\"hollow and roll\\" or \\"gorge cornice\\", and has been suggested to be a reminiscence in stone architecture of the primitive use of bound bunches of reeds as supports for buildings, the weight of the roof bending their tops out.Brier, Bob, Hobbs, A. Hoyt, Daily Life of the Ancient Egyptians, p. 200, 2008, Greenwood Publishing Group, , 9780313353062, google books = Crafts = Ancient Egyptian servant statuettes * Wood carving and Wooden statues – The extreme dryness of the climate of Egypt accounts for the existence of a number of woodcarvings from this remote period. Some wood panels from the tomb of Hosul Egypt, at Sakkarah are of the III. dynasty. The carving consists of Egyptian hieroglyphs and figures in low relief, and the style is extremely delicate and fine. A stool shown on one of the panels has the legs shaped like the fore and hind limbs of an animal, a form common in Egypt for thousands of years. * Hollow Glass Production and Glassware – Egypt and Mesopotamia were the first civilizations to produce glass works(3,500 BC.). After 1,500 BC. Egyptian craftsmen started to make hollow glass pots. * Egyptian faience * Cosmetic palette painting on papyrus * Watercolor paper – Painting on Papyrus was invented in Ancient Egypt long before the invention of Paper. hieroglyphs: ankh, basket, Eye of Horus, Sun Disk-(Gard.

Beginning in about 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians began to produce their own blue pigment known as Egyptian blue by grinding silica, lime, copper, and alkalai, and heating it to . This is considered the first synthetic pigment.Chase, W.T. 1971, \\"Egyptian blue as a pigment and ceramic material.\\" In: R. Brill (ed.) Science and Archaeology. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. Egyptian blue was used to paint wood, papyrus and canvas, and was used to colour a glaze to make faience beads, inlays, and pots. It was particularly used in funeral statuary and figurines and in tomb paintings. * Pectoral – The pectorals of ancient Egypt were a form of jewelry, often represented as a brooch. These were mostly worn by richer people and the pharaoh. = Music and Dance = Nefertari, wife of Ramesses II, holding a sistrum * Ceremonial dance * Pair Dancing – In pair dancing, two people of the same gender would perform together. This form of dancing was established by the 6th dynasty. * Group Dancing – There were two types of Egyptian group dances. One was performed in individual movements that confirmed a theme or idea or was carried out spontaneously as in prehistoric times. Dancers competed with one another, often in groups, substituting movement that were later established in funeral dances rites. tomb of Tutankhamun (1326–1336 BC) * Tambourines * Sistrum – The sistrum was a sacred instrument in ancient Egypt. Perhaps originating in the worship of Bastet, it was used in dances and religious ceremonies, particularly in the worship of the goddess Hathor, with the U-shape of the sistrum's handle and frame seen as resembling the face and horns of the cow goddess. * Cymbals * Double reed – Double reeds are used in making instruments in Ancient Egypt as early as 3300 BC. * Trumpet – The earliest trumpets date back to 1500 BC and earlier. The bronze and silver trumpets from Tutankhamun's grave in Egypt. * ClarinetOrigin of the clarinet, the-clarinets.net * Melisma - According to Demetrius of Falorene (3rd century A.D), The Egyptian priests used to praise the gods by singing 7 vowels successively producing sweet sounds. This is the first mention of the melisma which is used in many of the Coptic hymns today. * Syllabtic music style - The Syllabtic music style had been used for 2000 years in the coptic church \\"Tasbe7a\\". = Literature = * Written records – The Ancient Egyptian sentence found in the tomb of Seth-Peribsen is the world's oldest known sentence A raised-relief depiction of Amenemhat I accompanied by deities; the death of Amenemhat I is reported by his son Senusret I in the Story of Sinuhe. * Short story and Story telling – Story- telling started in Ancient Egypt around 200 BC. Among the oldest known stories the Story of Sinuhe and the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor. * Epistle – The ancient Egyptians wrote epistles, most often for pedagogical reasons. Egyptologist Edward Wente (1990) speculates that the Fifth-dynasty Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi—in his many letters sent to his viziers—was a pioneer in the epistolary genre. * Sebayt and Wisdom literature - The Maxims of Ptahhotep are among the oldest pieces of Wisdom literature. It was compiled during the 24th century BC.  Sports  skittles. The archeologist conjectured as to the particular arrangement of the items found. * Bowling – The earliest known forms of bowling date back to ancient Egypt, with wall drawings depicting bowling being found in a royal Egyptian tomb dated to 5200 B.C. Statement by Bowling Museum curator Bruce Pluckhahn. and miniature pins and balls in an Egyptian child's grave about 5200 B.C. Remnants of bowling balls were found among artifacts in ancient Egypt going back to the Egyptian protodynastic period in 3200 BC. What is thought to be a child's game involving porphyry (stone) balls, a miniature trilithon, and nine breccia-veined alabaster vase- shaped figures—thought to resemble the more modern game of skittles—was found in Naqada, Egypt in 1895. Cornell University Library. (archeologist's drawing) * Hockey – Drawings on tombs at Beni Hassan in Menia Governorate show players holding bats made of long palm-tree branches, with a bent end similar to that of the hockey bat. The hockey ball was made of compressed papyrus fibers covered with two pieces of leather in the shape of a semicircle. * Handball – Drawings of this sport are found on the Saqqara tombs, five thousand years old. The ball was made of leather and stuffed with plant fibers or hay, or made of papyrus plants in order to be light and more durable. It was seldom used for more than one match. * Gymnastics – Ancient Egyptians were the first to play Gymnastics. They even developed three types of Gymnastics which are: Rhythmic Gymnastics, Gymnastics: Consecutive Vault and floor gymnastics. * Boxing – The earliest evidence of boxing dates back to Egypt around 3000 BC. Detail from an ebony label of the First Dynasty pharaoh Den, depicting him running around the ritual boundary markers as part of the Sed festival * Weightlifting – Weightlifting was first recorded in ancient Egypt. One method of weightlifting was lifting a heavy sack of sand with one hand and keep it high in a vertical position. The player had to hold that sack of sand for some time and stay in the same position. This rule is still applied in the modern weightlifting. * High jump * Tug of War – This sport was practiced in the country side. * Tug of Hoop * Equilibrium (sport) Engravings at the Abusir necropolis showing scenes of archery, wrestling, and stick fighting * Running – Although running was very common in prehistoric times, running races began in Ancient Egypt during the Heb-sed festival as early as 3000 BC. * Fencing – The first historical evidence from archaeology of a fencing contest was found on the wall of a temple within Egypt built at a time dated to approximately 1190 B.C.Maxwell R. Garret, Emmanuil G. Kaidanov, Gil A. Pezza – – Foil, Saber, and Épée Fencing: Skills, Safety, Operations, and Responsibilities Penn State Press 1994 (revised, annotated), 227 pages, [Retrieved 2015-07-12] * Tahtib – The oldest traces of tahtib were found on engravings from the archaeological site of Abusir, an extensive necropolis of the Old Kingdom period, located in the south-western suburbs of Cairo. On some of the reliefs of the Pyramid of Sahure (V dynasty, c. 2500 BC);T. El Awady, ibid, VI.6.2, p. 208-210 ; D. Farout, Tahtib l’art de l’accomplissement et du bâton, ةgypte Afrique & Orient n° 60 (janvier 2011), p. 67-69. the images and explanatory captions are particularly precise and accurate in their depiction of what seems to be military training using sticks. Tahtib, with archery and wrestling, was then among the three disciplines of warfare taught to soldiers.  Cuisine  * Frying – Frying is believed to have first appeared in the Ancient Egyptian kitchen, during the Old Kingdom, around 2500 BCE.Tannahill, Reay. (1995). Food in History. Three Rivers Press. p. 75 * Banquet – Depictions of banquets can be found in paintings from both the Old Kingdom and New Kingdom. They usually started sometime in the afternoon. Men and women were separated unless they were married. Seating varied according to social status, with those of the highest status sitting on chairs, those slightly lower sat on stools and those lowest in rank sat on the raw floor. Before the food was served, basins were provided along with aromatics and cones of scented fat were lit to spread pleasant smells or to repel insects, depending on the type.Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt; banquets * Lettuce – Lettuce was first cultivated in ancient Egypt for the production of oil from its seeds. This plant was probably selectively bred by the Egyptians into a plant grown for its edible leaves,Katz and Weaver, pp. 375–376. with evidence of its cultivation appearing as early as 2680 BC. Lettuce was considered a sacred plant of the reproduction god Min, and it was carried during his festivals and placed near his images. The plant was thought to help the god \\"perform the sexual act untiringly.\\" Its use in religious ceremonies resulted in the creation of many images in tombs and wall paintings. The cultivated variety appears to have been about tall and resembled a large version of the modern romaine lettuce. These upright lettuces were developed by the Egyptians and passed to the Greeks, who in turn shared them with the Romans. * Radish Fruits of Balanites aegyptiaca from Saqqara. Mastaba of Perneb, 5th dynasty of Egypt. MET. * Balantines – Balanites has been cultivated in Egypt for more than 4000 years, and stones placed in tombs as votive offerings have been found as far back as the Twelfth Dynasty. * Foie gras and force-feeding – The technique of gavage dates as far back as 2500 BC, when the ancient Egyptians began keeping birds for food and deliberately fattened the birds through force-feeding. Today, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though it is produced and consumed worldwide, particularly in other European nations, the United States, and China. * Hardtack and Biscuits – versions using various grains date back to Ancient Rome, and as far back as Ancient Egypt. * Smy – thickened milk documented as existent in ancient Egypt. * Egyptian cheese - Archaeological evidence for making cheese in Egypt goes back about 5,000 years. In 2018, archeologists from Cairo University and the University of Catania reported the discovery of the oldest known cheese from Egypt. Discovered in the Saqqara necropolis, it is around 3200 years old. Earlier, remains identified as cheese were found in the funeral meal in an Egyptian tomb dating around 2900 BC.Walter Bryan Emery: A Funerary Repast in an Egyptian Tomb of the Archaic Period. Nederlands instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, Leiden 1962 Visual evidence of Egyptian cheesemaking was found in Egyptian tomb murals in approximately 2000 BC.History of Cheese. accessed 2007/06/10 * Yeast, Dough and Leavened bread – The earliest definite records of yeast come from Ancient Egypt.\\"The History of Bread Yeast\\". BBC. Retrieved December 24, 2006. * Desserts and Pies – During the Egyptian Neolithic period or New Stone Age period, the use of stone tools shaped by polishing or grinding, the domestication of plants and animals, the establishment of permanent villages, and the practice of crafts such as pottery and weaving became common. Early pies were in the form of flat, round or freeform crusty cakes called galettes consisting of a crust of ground oats, wheat, rye, or barley containing honey inside. These galettes developed into a form of early sweet pastry or desserts, evidence of which can be found on the tomb walls of the Pharaoh Ramesses II, who ruled from 1304 to 1237 BC, located in the Valley of the Kings. * Boiled eggs – In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, dating to approximately 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs, presumably those of the pelican, as offerings. In ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods and meals often started with an egg course. * Marshmallows - The first marshmallows were produced in Egypt around 2000 B.c. and were made by mixing Mallow sap, honey, grains and baked into cakes. Marshmallows were only served to the Gods of Ancient Egypt and pharaohs, as a candy or a dessert.  Clothing and Cosmetics  * Glove * Crown - Royal headdress was used in Egypt since the Predyanstic times. The king of Lower Egypt wore the Deshret crown while the king of Upper Egypt wore Hedjet. The Deshret and the Hedjet were found in Egyptian inscriptions as early as 3500 BC.Toby Wilkinson, Early Dynastic Egypt, (Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, 1999), 194-195. * Shirt - The world's oldest preserved garment, discovered by Flinders Petrie, is a \\"highly sophisticated\\" linen shirt from a First Dynasty Egyptian tomb at Tarkan, dated to c. 3000 BC: \\"the shoulders and sleeves have been finely pleated to give form-fitting trimness while allowing the wearer room to move. The small fringe formed during weaving along one edge of the cloth has been placed by the designer to decorate the neck opening and side seam.\\"Barber, Elizabeth Wayland (1994). Women's Work. The first 20,000 Years, p.135.Norton & Company, New York. * Hat - One of the first pictorial depictions of a hat appears in a tomb painting from Thebes, Egypt, which shows a man wearing a conical straw hat, dated to around 3200 BC. Hats were commonly worn in ancient Egypt. Many upper-class Egyptians shaved their heads, then covered it in a headdress intended to help them keep cool. * Umbrella - he earliest known parasols in Ancient Egyptian art date back to the Fifth Dynasty, around 2450 BC.White Muscarella, Oscar (1999): \\"Parasols in the Ancient Near East\\", \\"Source: Notes in the History of Art\\", Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 1-7 (1) The parasol is found in various shapes. In some instances it is depicted as a flabellum, a fan of palm-leaves or coloured feathers fixed on a long handle, resembling those now carried behind the Pope in processions. * Hairpin - Hairpins made of metal, ivory, bronze, carved wood, etc. were used in ancient Egypt for securing decorated hairstyles. Such hairpins suggest, as graves show, that many were luxury objects among the Egyptians and later the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans. * Shaving and Hygiene * Cosmetics * Kohl Schneider, Günther et al (2005). \\"Skin Cosmetics\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim * Liniment - made from Castor oil. * Henna and Hair dye - Ancient Egyptian, Ahmose-Henuttamehu (17th Dynasty, 1574 BCE): was probably a daughter of Seqenenre Tao and Ahmose Inhapy. Smith reports that the mummy of Henuttamehu's own hair had been dyed a bright red at the sides, probably with henna.G. Elliott Smith, The Royal Mummies, Duckworth Publishing; (September, 2000) * Perfume * High-heeled shoe - Paintings circa 3,500 BC. show images of men and women wearing high-heeled shoes. High-heeled shoes was also used by butchers to make them move easily over the dead animals.  Others  Hieroglyphs on stela in Louvre, circa 1321 BC * Egyptian hieroglyphs – Hieroglyphic symbol systems developed in the second half of the 4th millennium BC, such as the clay labels of a Predynastic ruler called \\"Scorpion I\\" (Naqada IIIA period, c. 33rd century BC) recovered at Abydos (modern Umm el-Qa'ab) in 1998 or the Narmer Palette (c. 31st century BC). * Hieratic – Hieratic developed as a cursive form of hieroglyphic script in the Naqada III period, roughly 3200–3000 BCE.Friedhelm Hoffmann (2012), Hieratic And Demotic Literature, OUP. * Demotic – Early Demotic (often referred to by the German term ') developed in Lower Egypt during the later part of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, particularly found on steles from the Serapeum at Saqqara. A specimen of Proto-Sinaitic script, one of the earliest (if not the very first) phonemic scripts * Alphabet – The history of the alphabet started in ancient Egypt. Egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals, to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names. In the Middle Bronze Age, an apparently \\"alphabetic\\" system known as the Proto- Sinaitic script appears in Egyptian turquoise mines in the Sinai peninsula dated to circa the 15th century BC, apparently left by Canaanite workers. In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at Wadi el-Hol dated to circa 1800 BC and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 BC, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time. Based on letter appearances and names, it is believed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs. This script had no characters representing vowels, although originally it probably was a syllabary, but unneeded symbols were discarded. * Rubric - red ink was used by Ancient Egyptians to emphasize an important text. Senet gaming board inscribed for Amenhotep III with separate sliding drawer, c. 1390–1353 BC * Mehen – Evidence of the game of Mehen is found from the Predynastic period dating from approximately 3000 BC and continues until the end of the Old Kingdom, around 2300 BC. * Senet - Senet, found in Predynastic and First Dynasty burials of Egypt, c. 3500 BC and 3100 BC respectively, is the oldest board game known to have existed. Senet was pictured in a fresco found in Merknera's tomb (3300–2700 BC). * Dice – The Egyptian game of senet was played with flat two- sided throwsticks which indicated the number of squares a player could move, and thus functioned as a form of dice. Senet was played before 3000 BC and up to the 2nd century AD. * Surveying - Surveying has occurred since humans built the first large structures. In ancient Egypt, a rope stretcher would use simple geometry to re-establish boundaries after the annual floods of the Nile River. The almost perfect squareness and north–south orientation of the Great Pyramid of Giza, built c. 2700 BC, affirm the Egyptians' command of surveying. * Histiography and King lists – The pharaohs of Egypt used to glorify their ancestors. The Den seal impressions is the oldest King list in the world dating to 3000 BC.Günter Dreyer: Ein Siegel der frühzeitlichen Königsnekropole von Abydos, in: MDAIK 43 (1986). 33–43 The Palermo Stone is one of seven surviving fragments of a stele known as the Royal Annals of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. The stele contained a list of the kings of Egypt from the First Dynasty (~3150–2890 BCE) through to the early part of the Fifth Dynasty (approx 2392–2283 BCE) and noted significant events in each year of their reigns. It was probably made during the Fifth Dynasty.Dodson, Aidan (2004) The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, p.62. Thames & Hudson, . These inscriptions are considered as the oldest History studies. * Logbooks – The Diary of Merer (Papyrus Jarf A and B) is the name for papyrus logbooks written over 4,500 years ago that record the daily activities of stone transportation from the Tura limestone quarry to and from Giza during the 4th Dynasty. They are the oldest known papyri with text. The text was found in 2013 by a French mission under the direction of archaeologists Pierre Tallet of Paris-Sorbonne University and Gregory Marouard in a cave in Wadi al-Jarf on the Red Sea coast. * Eye liner * Tobacco pipe * Pest control - As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents.Taylor, D., The Complete Contented Cat: Your Ultimate Guide to Feline Fulfilment, David & Charles, 2011, p.9. Archived from the OriginalBeadle, M., Cat, Simon and Schuster, 1979, pp. 93–96. Mongooses were introduced into homes to control rodents and snakes, probably by the ancient Egyptians.Sherman, D.M., Tending Animals in the Global Village: A Guide to International Veterinary Medicine, John Wiley & Sons, 2007, p. 45. * Thumb signal - The Egyptian Thumb up signified hope and victory while the Thumb down signified illness or defeat. * Wedding ring - It is commonly believed that the first examples of wedding rings were found in ancient Egypt. Relics dating to 6,000 years ago, including papyrus scrolls, are evidence of the exchange of braided rings of hemp or reeds between spouses. Ancient Egypt considered the circle to be a symbol of eternity, and the ring served to signify the perpetual love of the spouses. This was also the origin of the custom of wearing the wedding ring on the ring finger of the left hand, because the ancient Egyptians believed that this finger enclosed a special vein that was connected directly to the heart, denominated in Latin the \\"Vena amoris\\". * Birthday Celebration - The birthday of a pharoah was considered a national holiday. * Magic Wand * Evil eye concept * Amulets  Disputed  Designs on some of the labels or token from Abydos, carbon-dated to circa 3400–3200 BC and among the earliest form of writing in Egypt. They are virtually similar to contemporary clay tags from Uruk, Mesopotamia. * Invention of Writing - Disputed with Sumer. Writing was invented in the Middle East, however there's no consensus among scholars where exactly it was invented. Formerly, Scholars used to consider Cuneiform script as the oldest known writing system dating back to (3,400 – 3,100 BC.). It was even thought that the idea of writing travelled from Mesopotamia to Egypt. This changed however with the discovery of Tomb U-j. Archaeologists found clay labels inscribed with fully developed Hieroglyphs dating back to 3,400 – 3,200 BC. This discovery started a debate over whether writing began in Egypt or Mesopotamia. Today, the general consensus among scholars is that both civilizations developed writing system independently and during the same period.\\"...The Mesopotamians invented writing around 3200 bc without any precedent to guide them, as did the Egyptians, independently as far as we know, at approximately the same time\\" The Oxford History of Historical Writing. Vol. 1. To AD 600, page 5 Modern discoveries even revealed possibly undeciphered scripts such as the Vinca symbols in the Balkans (5,000 BC.)Haarmann, Harald: \\"Geschichte der Schrift\\", C.H. Beck, 2002, , p. 20 or the Jiahu symbols in china (6,000 BC.). * Carbon - Disputed with Sumer. By 2,500 BC, Carbon was used in both Ancient Egypt and Sumer. *Circumnavigation of Africa - A tale told by Herodotus that Pharaoh Necho II commissioned a naval expedition to circumnavigate Africa. However, the origin of this story is questioned by modern scholars.For instance, the Egyptologist Alan Lloyd wrote \\"Given the context of Egyptian thought, economic life, and military interests, it is impossible for one to imagine what stimulus could have motivated Necho in such a scheme and if we cannot provide a reason which is sound within Egyptian terms of reference, then we have good reason to doubt the historicity of the entire episode.\\" * Dockyard - Egypt's oldest harbour is Wadi al-Jarf, which is contemporary with Lothal in the Indus Valley Civilization. * Proto-Currency - Long before the first currency (which was invented in the Kingdom of Lydia), The Egyptians used a system of Proto- currency based on metal weighs. The Deben was often used.T. G. H. James, Pharaoh's People: Scenes from Life in Imperial Egypt, Tauris Parke Paperbacks 2007, , p.245 * Banks and Central banks – Since there was no coins at the time of Ancient Egypt, Banks during that time were similar to grain warehouses. Some scholars suggest that the Egyptian grain-banking system became so well- developed that it was comparable to major modern banks, both in terms of its number of branches and employees, and in terms of the total volume of transactions. During the rule of the Greek Ptolemies, the granaries were transformed into a network of banks centered in Alexandria, where the main accounts from all of the Egyptian regional grain-banks were recorded. This became the site of one of the earliest known government central banks, and may have reached its peak with the assistance of Greek bankers. * Lute, Harp and Lyre – The origin of these instruments are not known but they were used in Sumer and Ancient Egypt as early as the 4th millennium BC. * Pentatonic scale - Although some evidence suggests that it has been used in prehistoric times, It's highly possible that the pentatonic scale was invented in Ancient Egypt during the Old kingdom of Egypt circa 2600 b.c. * Frozen desserts – The origins of frozen desserts are unknown. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs show a snow-filled vessel next to fruit juice. * Plough * Candle – Ancient Egyptians developed torches that were similar to candles. However, the invention of the candle is given to the Romans. * Ben oil * Tattoo - In 2018, the oldest figurative tattoos in the world were discovered on two mummies from Egypt which are dated between 3351 and 3017 BCE. * Precession of equinox - The credit of this discovery is given to the greek Hipparchus. However, claims have been made that precession was known in Ancient Egypt during the dynastic era, prior to the time of Hipparchus (Ptolemaic period). However, these claims remain controversial. Some buildings in the Karnak temple complex, for instance, allegedly were oriented toward the point on the horizon where certain stars rose or set at key times of the year.

A History of Mathematics: An Introduction, p. 184. Addison Wesley, : \\"But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become \\"Hellenized,\\" to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.\\"  * Heron's formula - Hero described a method for iteratively computing the square root of a number.Today, however, his name is most closely associated with Heron's formula for finding the area of a triangle from its side lengths. * He also devised a method for calculating cube roots in the 1st century AD. He also designed a shortest path algorithm, Given two points A and B on one side of a line, find C a point on the straight line, that minimizes AC+BC. * Vending machine - The first vending machine was also one of his constructions; when a coin was introduced via a slot on the top of the machine, a set amount of holy water was dispensed. This was included in his list of inventions in his book Mechanics and Optics. When the coin was deposited, it fell upon a pan attached to a lever. The lever opened up a valve which let some water flow out. The pan continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a counter-weight would snap the lever back up and turn off the valve., pp. 66–67 * Force pump - The force pump was widely used in the Roman world, and one application was in a fire-engine. * Heron's fountain - A standalone fountain that operates under self-contained hydro-static energy; now called Heron's fountain. * In optics, Hero formulated the principle of the shortest path of light: If a ray of light propagates from point A to point B within the same medium, the path-length followed is the shortest possible. It was nearly 1000 years later that Alhacen expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and the principle was later stated in this form by Pierre de Fermat in 1662; the most modern form is that the optical path is stationary. * A wind-wheel operating an organ, marking the first instance in history of wind powering a machine.A.G. Drachmann, \\"Heron's Windmill\\", Centaurus, 7 (1961), pp. 145–151Dietrich Lohrmann, \\"Von der östlichen zur westlichen Windmühle\\", Archiv für Kulturgeschichte, Vol. 77, Issue 1 (1995), pp. 1–30 (10f.) * Hero also invented many mechanisms for the Greek theater, including an entirely mechanical play almost ten minutes in length, powered by a binary-like system of ropes, knots, and simple machines operated by a rotating cylindrical cogwheel. The sound of thunder was produced by the mechanically-timed dropping of metal balls onto a hidden drum. * A programmable cart that was powered by a falling weight. The \\"program\\" consisted of strings wrapped around the drive axle.* * Automatic door - In the 1st century AD, mathematician Heron of Alexandria in Roman Egypt invented the first known automatic door. He described two different automatic door applications. The first application used heat from a fire lit by the city's temple priest. After a few hours atmospheric pressure built up in a brass vessel causing it to pump water into adjacent containers. These containers acted as weights that, through a series of ropes and pulleys, would open the temple's doors at about the time people were to arrive for prayer. Heron used a similar application to open the gates to the city.  Pappus of Alexandria  * Pappus's hexagon theorem * Pappus's centroid theorem  Ptolemy  * Ptolemy's world map - It included 8,000 locations from Shetland islands to the Ethiopian plateau and from the Canary islands to China. Significant contributions of Ptolemy's map is the first use of longitudinal and latitudinal lines as well as specifying terrestrial locations by celestial observations. The Geography was translated from Greek into Arabic in the 9th century and played a role in the work of al- Khwārizmī before lapsing into obscurity. The idea of a global coordinate system revolutionized European geographical thought, however, and inspired more mathematical treatment of cartography. * Ptolemy was the first to measure the angles of incidence and refraction but failed to understand the relation between them (Snell's Law). * Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale  Others  The earliest known surviving pair of socks, created by naalbinding. Dating from 300–500, these were excavated from Oxyrhynchus on the Nile in Egypt. The split toes were designed for use with sandals. On display in the Victoria and Albert museum, reference 2085&A-1900.; * Saqiyah - Paddle-driven water-lifting wheels had appeared in ancient Egypt by the 4th century BCE. According to John Peter Oleson, both the compartmented wheel and the hydraulic noria appeared in Egypt by the 4th century BCE, with the sakia being invented there a century later. This is supported by archeological finds at Faiyum, where the oldest archeological evidence of a water wheel has been found, in the form of a sakia dating back to the 3rd century BCE. A papyrus dating to the 2nd century BCE also found in Faiyum mentions a water wheel used for irrigation, a 2nd-century BC fresco found at Alexandria depicts a compartmented sakia, and the writings of Callixenus of Rhodes mention the use of a sakia in the Ptolemaic Kingdom during the reign of Ptolemy IV Philopator in the late 3rd century BCE. * Sock * 15 centuries before Braille, wood-carving techniques were in use in the Catechical school of Alexandria by blind scholars to read and write.  Religion  * Catechesis - The oldest Catechical school in the world is the catechical school of Alexandria. * Theology - Origen an Egyptian scholar of Alexandria is considered to be the father of Theology. * Monasticism - Another major contribution made by the Copts in Egypt to Christianity was the creation and organization of monasticism. Worldwide Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the Egyptian example. The most prominent figures of the monastic movement were Anthony the Great, Paul of Thebes, Macarius the Great, Shenouda the Archimandrite and Pachomius the Cenobite. By the end of the 5th century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian desert. Since then pilgrims have visited the Egyptian Desert Fathers to emulate their spiritual, disciplined lives. Saint Basil the Great Archbishop of Caesarea Mazaca, and the founder and organiser of the monastic movement in Asia Minor, visited Egypt around 357 AD and his monastic rules are followed by the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Saint Jerome, who translated the Bible into Latin, came to Egypt while en route to Jerusalem around 400 AD and left details of his experiences in his letters. Saint Benedict founded the Benedictine Order in the 6th century on the model of Saint Pachomius, although in a stricter form. Coptic Christians practice male circumcision as a rite of passage.  Islamic Egypt  * Fountain pen - According to Qadi al-Nu'man al-Tamimi (d. 974) in his Kitab al-Majalis wa 'l-musayarat, the Fatimid caliph Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah in Arab Egypt demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir, allowing it to be held upside-down without leaking. * Packaging and labeling - The earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035, when a Persian traveler visiting markets in Cairo, Arab Egypt, noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold. * Sugar refinery - Date back to the 12th century in Arab Egypt. * Torpedo - Torpedo-like weapons were first proposed many centuries before they were successfully developed.

Using a rapid ultrafast laser technique (consisting of ultrashort laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales – short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions. Zewail became known as the \\"father of femtochemistry\\". * Speed-ball - Speed- Ball is a racquet sport invented in Egypt in 1961 by Mohamed Lotfy (grandfather of Taimour Lotfy) for the training of beginner tennis players. Today it is a sport in its own right, enjoying popularity not only in Egypt but in other countries. Several of these countries make up the International Federation of Speed-Ball (FISB). * Mansourasaurus - Hesham Sallam, a paleontologist at Mansoura University, together with a team of students discovered a sauropod skeleton in the Dakhla Oasis in Egypt's Western Desert. In 2016, it was reported that over thirty dinosaur specimens had been excavated, among them titanosaurian sauropods.Iman El-Dawoudi, Patrick M O'Connor, Mahmoud Kora and Joseph J W Sertich, 2016, \\"NEW DINOSAUR REMAINS FROM THE CAMPANIAN QUSEIR FORMATION, WESTERN DESERT, EGYPT\\", SVP October 2016, Program and Abstracts, p 129  Inventions by MOSFET and Mohamed M. Atalla  Mohamed M. Atalla. The invention of the MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor), by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, enabled the practical use of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) transistors as memory cell storage elements, a function previously served by magnetic cores. MOS memory was developed by John Schmidt at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1964. The MOSFET forms the basis of modern electronics, and is the basic element in most modern electronic equipment. It is the most common transistor in electronics, and the most widely used semiconductor device in the world. It has been described as the \\"workhorse of the electronics industry\\" and \\"the base technology\\" of the late 20th to early 21st centuries. MOSFET scaling and miniaturization (see List of semiconductor scale examples) have been the primary factors behind the rapid exponential growth of electronic semiconductor technology since the 1960s, as the rapid miniaturization of MOSFETs has been largely responsible for the increasing transistor density, increasing performance and decreasing power consumption of integrated circuit chips and electronic devices since the 1960s. * Aluminum gate and Metal gate - A metal gate, in the context of a lateral metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) stack, is just that—the gate material is made from a metal. The first MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Egyptian engineer Mohamed Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and demonstrated in 1960. They used silicon as channel material and a non-self-aligned aluminium (Al) gate. * Atalla Box - He invented the first hardware security module (HSM), dubbed the \\"Atalla Box\\", a security system which encrypted PIN and ATM messages, and protected offline devices with an un-guessable PIN- generating key. He commercially released the \\"Atalla Box\\" in 1973. The success of the \\"Atalla Box\\" led to the wide adoption of PIN-based hardware security modules. Its PIN verification process was similar to the later IBM 3624. By 1998 an estimated 70% of all ATM transactions in the United States were routed through specialized Atalla hardware modules, and by 2003 the Atalla Box secured 80% of all ATM machines in the world,\\"Martin M. (John) Atalla\\". Purdue University. 2003. Retrieved 2 October 2013. increasing to 85% as of 2006. Atalla's HSM products protect 250million card transactions every day as of 2013, and still secure the majority of the world's ATM transactions as of 2014. * Atalla Key Block or Block cipher - The root of all cryptographic block formats used within the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards lies with the Atalla Key Block (AKB), which was a key innovation of the Atalla Box, the first hardware security module (HSM). It was developed in 1972 by Mohamed M. Atalla, founder of Atalla Corporation (now Utimaco Atalla), and released in 1973. The AKB was a key block, which is required to securely interchange symmetric keys or PINs with other actors of the banking industry. This secure interchange is performed using the AKB format. * Charge trap flash - The original MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and demonstrated in 1960. Kahng went on to invent the floating-gate MOSFET with Simon Min Sze at Bell Labs, and they proposed its use as a floating-gate (FG) memory cell, in 1967. This was the first form of non-volatile memory based on the injection and storage of charges in a floating-gate MOSFET, which later became the basis for EPROM (erasable PROM), EEPROM (electrically erasable PROM) and flash memory technologies. * Depletion and enhancement modes - The first MOSFET (metal- oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) demonstrated by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1960 was an enhancement mode silicon semiconductor device. In 1963, both depletion and enhancement mode MOSFETs were described by Steve R. Hofstein and Fred P. Heiman at RCA Laboratories. * Display driver - The use of integrated circuit technology to drive a display driver chip dates back to the late 1960s. Its development was led by Howard C. Borden, Gerald P. Pighini, and Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla, at HP Associates and HP Labs, who had engaged in research and development (R&D;) on practical LEDs between 1962 and 1968. * FET amplifier and Thermal oxidation - The basic principle of the field-effect transistor (FET) amplifier was first proposed by Austro-Hungarian physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925.Lilienfeld, Julius Edgar (1926-10-08) \\"Method and apparatus for controlling electric currents\\" However, his early FET concept was not a practical design. The FET concept was later also theorized by Oskar Heil in the 1930s and William Shockley in the 1940s, but there was no working practical FET built at the time. A breakthrough came with the work of Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla in the late 1950s. He developed the method of surface passivation, which later became critical to the semiconductor industry as it made possible the mass-production of silicon semiconductor technology, such as integrated circuit (IC) chips. For the surface passivation process, he developed the method of thermal oxidation, which was a breakthrough in silicon semiconductor technology. The surface passivation method was presented by Atalla in 1957. * Gate dielectric - The earliest gate dielectric used in a field-effect transistor was silicon dioxide (SiO2). The silicon and silicondioxide surface passivation process was developed by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla at Bell Labs during the late 1950s, and then used in the first MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors). Silicon dioxide remains the standard gate dielectric in MOSFET technology. * Gate oxide (With multiple varieties: 20 µm process, 10 nm process, 130 nm process) - The first MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field- effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Egyptian engineer Mohamed Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. In 1960, Atalla and Kahng fabricated the first MOSFET with a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm, along with a gate length of 20µm. In 1987, Bijan Davari led an IBM research team that demonstrated the first MOSFET with a 10 nm gate oxide thickness, using tungsten-gate technology. * Internet security - In 1972, Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla filed for a remote PIN verification system, which utilized encryption techniques to assure telephone link security while entering personal ID information, which would be transmitted as encrypted data over telecommunications networks to a remote location for verification. This was a precursor to Internet security and e-commerce. At the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks (NAMSB) conference in January 1976, Atalla Corporation (founded by Mohamed Atalla) and Bunker Ramo Corporation (founded by George Bunker and Simon Ramo) introduced the earliest products designed for dealing with online security. Atalla announced an upgrade to its Identikey hardware security module, called the Interchange Identikey. It added the capabilities of processing online transactions and dealing with network security. * LED lamp and LED display - The first low- powered LEDs were developed in the early 1960s, and only produced light in the low, red frequencies of the spectrum. In 1968, the first commercial LED lamps were introduced: Hewlett-Packard's LED display, which was developed under Howard C. Borden, Gerald P. Pighini, and Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla, and Monsanto Company's LED indicator lamp. However, early LED lamps were inefficient and could only display deep red colors, making them unsuitable for general lighting and restricting their usage to numeric displays and indicator lights. * Microprocessor - The microprocessor has origins in the development of the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor), which was first demonstrated by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng of Bell Labs in 1960. * MOS integrated circuit - The MOSFET is the most widely used type of transistor and the most critical device component in integrated circuit (IC) chips. The monolithic integrated circuit chip was enabled by the surface passivation process, which electrically stabilized silicon surfaces via thermal oxidation, making it possible to fabricate monolithic integrated circuit chips using silicon. The surface passivation process was developed by Mohamed M. Atalla at Bell Labs in 1957. This was the basis for the planar process, developed by Jean Hoerni at Fairchild Semiconductor in early 1959, which was critical to the invention of the monolithic integrated circuit chip by Robert Noyce later in 1959. The same year, Atalla used his surface passivation process to invent the MOSFET with Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs. This was followed by the development of clean rooms to reduce contamination to levels never before thought necessary, and coincided with the development of photolithography which, along with surface passivation and the planar process, allowed circuits to be made in few steps. * MOSFET - In 1955 Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derrick accidentally covered the surface of silicon wafer with a layer of silicon dioxide. They showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer, while allowing for others, thus what they discovered was passivation of semiconductor surface using thermal oxidation. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior stuff, including Jean Hoerni. Mohamed M. Atalla at the time was dealing with the problem of surface states. He picked up Frosch's work on oxidation, attempting to passivate the surface of silicon through the formation of oxide layer over it. He thought that growing a very thin high quality thermally grown on top of a clean silicon wafer would neutralize surface states enough to make a practical working transistor. He wrote his findings in his BTL memos in 1957, before presenting his work at an Electrochemical Society meeting in 1958. The next year John L. Moll described a MOS diode and coined the name \\"MOS\\" in the conference paper on the MOS diode. J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer, who studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, managed to fabricate the first high quality Si/ stack. * MOS capacitor and Field effect (semiconductor) - The MOS capacitor structure is the heart of the MOSFET. Consider a MOS capacitor where the silicon base is of p-type. If a positive voltage is applied at the gate, holes which are at the surface of the p-type substrate will be repelled by the electric field generated by the voltage applied. At first, the holes will simply be repelled and what will remain on the surface will be immobile (negative) atoms of the acceptor type, which creates a depletion region on the surface. Remember that a hole is created by an acceptor atom, e.g. Boron, which has one less electron than Silicon. One might ask how can holes be repelled if they are actually non-entities? The answer is that what really happens is not that a hole is repelled, but electrons are attracted by the positive field, and fill these holes, creating a depletion region where no charge carriers exist because the electron is now fixed onto the atom and immobile. * Nanotechnology, Nanocircuitry Nanoelectronics and Molecular scale electronics - In 1960, Egyptian engineer Mohamed Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs fabricated the first MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) with a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm, along with a gate length of 20µm. In 1962, Atalla and Kahng fabricated a nanolayer-base metal–semiconductor junction (M–S junction) transistor that used gold (Au) thin films with a thickness of 10 nm. * NMOS logic and PMOS logic - The MOSFET was invented by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and demonstrated in 1960. They fabricated both PMOS and NMOS devices with a 20µm process. However, the NMOS devices were impractical, and only the PMOS type were practical devices. * p–n junction isolation - Before the invention of the integrated circuit, discrete diodes and transistors exhibited relatively high reverse-bias junction leakages and low breakdown voltage, caused by the large density of traps at the surface of single crystal silicon. The solution to this problem was the surface passivation process developed by Egyptian engineer Mohamed Atalla at Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). He discovered that when a thin layer of silicon dioxide was grown on the surface of silicon where a p–n junction intercepts the surface, the leakage current of the junction was reduced by a factor from 10 to 100. This showed that the oxide reduces and stabilizes many of the interface and oxide traps. Oxide-passivation of silicon surfaces allowed diodes and transistors to be fabricated with significantly improved device characteristics, while the leakage path along the surface of the silicon was also effectively shut off. This became one of the fundamental isolation capabilities necessary for planar technology and integrated circuits. According to Fairchild Semiconductor engineer Chih-Tang Sah, Atalla's surface passivation method was critical to the development of the silicon integrated circuit. * Planar process - Surface passivation, the process by which a semiconductor surface is rendered inert, and does not change semiconductor properties as a result of interaction with air or other materials in contact with the surface or edge of the crystal, was first developed by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla at BTL in the late 1950s. * PIN - Mohamed M. Atalla invented the first PIN-based hardware security module (HSM), dubbed the \\"Atalla Box\\", a security system which encrypted PIN and ATM messages, and protected offline devices with an un-guessable PIN-generating key. In 1972, Atalla filed for his PIN verification system, which included an encoded card reader and described a system that utilized encryption techniques to assure telephone link security while entering personal ID information that was transmitted to a remote location for verification. * Secure cryptoprocessor and hardware security module - The hardware security module (HSM), a type of secure cryptoprocessor, was invented by Egyptian-American engineer Mohamed M. Atalla, in 1972. * Semiconductor device fabrication - The first metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) were fabricated by Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs between 1959 and 1960. There were originally two types of MOSFET technology, PMOS (p-type MOS) and NMOS (n-type MOS). Both types were developed by Atalla and Kahng when they originally invented the MOSFET, fabricating both PMOS and NMOS devices at 20µm and 10µm scales. * Silicon wafer - In the 1950s, Mohamed Atalla investigated the surface properties of silicon semiconductors at Bell Labs, where he adopted a new method of semiconductor device fabrication, coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide, so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below, overcoming the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer. This is known as surface passivation, a method that later became critical to the semiconductor industry as it made possible the mass-production of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). The surface passivation method was presented by Atalla in 1957, and was later the basis for the metal- oxide-semiconductor (MOS) process invented by Atalla and Dawon Kahng in 1959. * Telephone banking - In 1972, Egyptian engineer Mohamed M. Atalla, the founder of Atalla Corporation, filed for a remote personal verification system which utilized encryption techniques to assure telephone link security while entering personal ID information, which would be transmitted as encrypted data over telecommunications networks to a remote location for verification. This was a precursor to telephone banking. The patent mentioned the system's application for the use of a credit card over a telephone call. * His invention of the MOSFET was initially overlooked at Bell, which led to him resigning from Bell and joining Hewlett-Packard (HP), founding its Semiconductor Lab in 1962 and then HP Labs in 1966, before leaving to join Fairchild Semiconductor, founding its Microwave & Optoelectronics division in 1969. His work at HP and Fairchild included research on Schottky diode, gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP), indium arsenide (InAs) and light-emitting diode (LED) technologies. * Mohamed M. Atalla was also the co-founder of Bell Labs, HP, Fairchild Semiconductor and Atalla Corporation.

The case reaffirmed the principle of \\"misunderstanding or ignorance of an established and relevant fact\\" and further developed the doctrine of error of fact; in that a decision could be quashed on the basis of it having taken into account a factual mistake. The case also dealt with the issue of undue delay and guiding principles were laid out. Facts On 25 May 1991, a woman known only as ′A′, was seriously sexually assaulted by two men during a burglary at her home. In November, some six months later, she sought compensation through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. A′s application to the CICB was refused verbally on 31 August 1993, and subsequently in writing by the end of 1993. Five days after the burglary, ′A′ had been examined by a police doctor who had confirm that the findings of the examination were consistent with the allegation of buggery. ′A′ was told that she did not need to ask for police statements as they would be produced by the police. When A′s claim was heard by the CICB, the report by the police doctor was not included, which led to the Board taking the view that the police witnesses believed that no medical evidence was available to support her claim. Undue delay When ′A′ made the application for judicial review, she was considerably out of time as the application had not been made within the 3 month period from the date the grounds arose. The question of leave had been dealt with by the High Court even though A′s application fell outside the time period provided for in Order 53, rule 4, of the Rules of the Supreme Court. The order was granted on 14 February 1995 by Carnwath J. and was described as ″unambiguous″ by Lord Slynn of Hadley, who went on to say that the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to reconsider the question of an extension of time. Effect of the two provisions Lord Slynn cited two provisions as being relevant to the issue of delay: Order 53, rule 4, of the Rules of the Supreme Court (pertaining to good reason for an extension of time) and Section 31 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (which deals with hardship, prejudice, detriment, and the justification for a refusal of leave). A six–point list was set out in order to help elucidate on the effect of the two provisions: *When an application for Judicial review is made on an ex parte basis, leave can be refused, deferred to the substantive hearing, or granted. *If good reason can be shown for extending the period, the court has the power to grant leave. On an ex parte application, it is expected that the demonstration of good reason would be from the position of the applicant. *If leave is granted, an application to set it aside may be made, although the Court of Appeal have stressed that this should not be encouraged. *Unless set aside, there is no application for leave to apply for judicial review at the substantive hearing since leave will have already been given. The question of leave will not be re–opened at the substantive hearing on the basis that there is no ground for extending time under Order 53, rule 4(1). *Unless the court sets aside the initial grant without a separate application having been made for that to be done, there is no power to refuse to grant leave at the substantive hearing on the basis of hardship or prejudice or detriment to good administration, as the court would have already granted leave. In effect, it would be too late to refuse leave. The court does, however, have jurisdiction under section 31(6) to refuse to grant relief. *The questions that fall under the two provisions (good reason for an extension of time) and (hardship, prejudice, detriment, justifying a refusal of leave) may be determined if the application is adjourned to the substantive hearing. The House of Lords overruled the Court of Appeal′s reconsideration because the issue of whether it had been demonstrated that there was good reason for an extension of the time period had already been concluded at the point of A′s application for review and no good reason had been shown for extending the period within the meaning of Order 53, r. 4(1). Judgment The Law Lords unanimously allowed the appeal, accepting that there was jurisdiction to quash the Board′s decision on the ground of taking into account a mistaken fact leading to a breach of the rules of natural justice, which in turn amounted to ″unfairness″. The Lords preferred to base their decision to quash on the ground of unfairness and left the question of review as to error of fact—an area of law in a state of flux—to be considered at a later time. Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in his closing comments said that the decision would be remitted to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.

Trump, a niece of Donald Trump. It was published on July 14, 2020, by Simon & Schuster. The book provides an insider view of the Trump family dynamics, reveals details about financial dealings, including the author's work as the anonymous source who revealed the suspected tax fraud to The New York Times. The Trump family launched a lawsuit in an attempt to stop its publication but was unsuccessful in delaying the release of the book. Background The book's author, Mary L. Trump, a clinical psychologist, is a daughter of Fred Trump Jr., and a granddaughter of Fred Trump Sr. She has taught graduate students in the subjects of trauma, psychopathology, and developmental psychology. Mary has written a dissertation on stalking victims, conducted research on schizophrenia, and written parts of the prominent medical manual Diagnosis: Schizophrenia. Her father died in 1981 at the age of 42 from a heart attack due to alcoholism. Following the death of Fred Sr. in 1999, Mary and her brother, Fred III, contested Fred Sr.'s will in probate court, claiming that Fred Sr. was suffering from dementia, and the will was \\"procured by fraud and undue influence\\" by Fred Sr.'s other children, Donald, Maryanne, and Robert. A week later, Donald, Maryanne, and Robert terminated health insurance coverage for Fred III's son, William, an 18-month old with epileptic spasms. In an interview with the New York Daily News, Mary said that her \\"aunt and uncles should be ashamed of themselves. I'm sure they are not.\\" The suit was settled, with William's health insurance reinstated. Donald in 2016 explained his actions: \\"I was angry because they sued.\\" After her uncle's presidential campaign, Mary Trump came into contact with The New York Times, and provided boxes of tax documents from the Trump family as an anonymous source. The documents were used for a 2018 article that detailed financial fraud by Trump that won the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for David Barstow, Susanne Craig, and Russ Buettner. Barstow pursued Mary Trump with an offer to ghostwrite a book for her. He introduced her to Andrew Wylie, his agent, who offered her a multi-million dollar advance for her participation. Craig and Buettner were angry when they found out about this, and the editors of the Times forbade Barstow from writing the book, as they felt that his involvement would breach the Times ethical guidelines. Mary Trump ended up working with Jay Mandel of WME, and sold her book's publishing rights to Simon & Schuster in an auction. Synopsis The book takes the form of a chronological biography; while Donald Trump is the stated focal point, significant attention is devoted to other individuals in the Trump family as a way to shed light on their mutual dynamics and financial dealings. Drawing on her skills as a clinical psychologist, the author attempts to provide the inner familial workings as a background from which to analyze Donald, but has avoided outright diagnosis. In Part One: The Cruelty is the Point, the author describes the character of Fred Trump Sr., the patriarch of the family, and attempts to elucidate how his treatment of his children has had a lasting impact on them. Based on recollections from family members, Mary diagnoses Fred Sr. as a high-functioning sociopath who sought to use those around him for his benefit. Donald, while observing his brother Fred Jr. being criticized over perceived shortfalls, would adopt his nature to avoid displays of sadness, weakness or kindness. Mary states Fred's influence ensured that Donald would have limited access to his range of emotions. Their mother, Mary, is described as physically and mentally challenged during the children's formative years as a result of osteoporosis. Later in life, she would reveal to Mary that she was relieved when Donald was sent to military school, as he had become belligerent and disobedient towards her. In Part Two: The Wrong Side of the Tracks, the author chronicles the early career of Donald Trump. She observes that, since Fred Sr. never reached the fame he considers deserving of his business acumen, he was happy to allow his son Donald to play the public face while he took care of the actual work by leaning heavily on political and other connections. Meanwhile, Fred Jr. sees that after being unfairly blamed for the collapse of large housing projects, he is sidelined by his brother Donald and thus chose to leave the family business to pursue a career as a commercial pilot. The family's constant denigration of his chosen profession contributed to his struggles with alcoholism and other issues, leading to both his aviation career and marriage failing. He eventually died due to a heart attack in a hospital away from family, while his parents waited at home and his brother Donald was at a movie theater. In Part Three: Smoke and Mirrors, the author details how, as the influence of Fred Sr. waned, Donald Trump struggles to operate his business without the knowledge and connections his father provides. Mary describes Donald as an inept businessman who was able to keep up appearances only due to his associates' unwillingness to tear down the facade, as they see his notoriety as an asset. At one point Donald has to negotiate with his creditors for a monthly allowance of $450,000. Mary also focuses on how the family turned on her after Fred Sr.'s death, including cutting off her and her brother's health insurance, resulting in precarious conditions for her brother's child. Mary decides to settle by allowing the rest of the family to buy out her partnership of a family corporation at what she now understands to be a significant undervaluation. She eventually learned the true value of her family's wealth by acting as an anonymous source in the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times investigation. In Part Four: The Worst Investment Ever Made, the author provides her view of the period when Donald Trump mounted a successful campaign for the US presidency. Mary again draws on her training as a psychologist to claim that her grandfather Fred Sr. initiated a direct line to more power actors, all enabling Donald's worst instincts to serve their respective needs. She states that, due to Trump's psychological capacity being forcefully stopped from fully developing at a young age, he remains extremely susceptible to manipulation by more capable local and foreign actors.  Allegations  The book reportedly covers how Mary provided The New York Times with confidential tax documents from the Trump family, resulting in the Times alleging that Donald engaged in fraud, as well as reporting that Donald transferred approximately $413 million from his father's real estate businesses to aid his own struggling businesses during the 1990s. The book also accuses Donald of paying a friend, named Joe Shapiro, to take the SAT for him. Mary says in the book that Donald and Fred Sr. neglected her father and contributed to his death from alcoholism, and that Donald later disparaged and disregarded Fred Sr. upon the onset of Alzheimer's disease in Fred Sr.  Release of tape recordings  On August 22, 2020, Mary released tape recordings of her conversations with Maryanne Trump Barry, Donald's sister and a former federal judge appointed to judicial offices by President Ronald Reagan and by President Bill Clinton. Barry's statements in the recordings substantiate many of the claims made in Mary's book. Mary's reason for recording the conversations was to collect evidence that the settlement of her inheritance from Donald's father was based on a severely understated total worth. In the recordings, Barry expresses horror at Donald's immigration policy of separating children from their parents, disparages his religious supporters for their lack of compassion, and laments his cruelty and phoniness. The recordings reveal that Barry was the source of Mary's claim that Donald paid a friend to take the college entrance exam for him. Release Simon & Schuster initially set a release date of August 11, 2020, and gave the exclusive report about it to The Daily Beast, which published an article about the book on June 15. Two days later, the book reached No. 5 on Amazon's bestseller list. The response to the article led them to move the publication date up to July 28. On July 6, Simon & Schuster announced that they had moved the publication date to July 14 as a result of \\"high demand and extraordinary interest\\", which had led it to surpass The Room Where It Happened as the No. 1 bestseller on Amazon. On July 17, 2020, Simon & Schuster announced that the book had sold more than 950,000 copies in pre-orders by its publication date, a new record for the publisher. In its first week, Too Much and Never Enough sold 1.35 million copies. Donald Trump, according to The Daily Beast, discussed the possibility of taking legal action against Mary. Donald told Axios that Mary had previously signed a \\"very powerful\\" non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that \\"covers everything\\", therefore according to Donald, she was \\"not allowed to write a book\\". Robert Trump filed suit on June 23, attempting to secure a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to block publication, citing Mary's NDA. In a hearing on June 25, Judge Peter J. Kelly of the Queens County Surrogate Court in New York City dismissed the case over lack of jurisdiction. Robert took his case to a general trial court, the New York Supreme Court in Dutchess County, where on June 30, Justice Hal B. Greenwald ordered a temporary stay of the release of the book, while setting a hearing for July 10 to decide whether the book should be permanently blocked from publication. A New York appellate justice, Alan D. Scheinkman, on July 1, reversed the lower court’s decision, finding that Simon & Schuster was not a party to the NDA, was not subject to prior restraint and pre-publication injunction considering the First Amendment, ruling that Simon & Schuster could proceed to publish the book pending a hearing on July 10, leaving Mary enjoined from book sale activities, and leaving open the question of whether Mary had violated the NDA. On July 2, 2020, Mary filed a sworn affidavit alleging she was not bound by the NDA clause in the settlement agreement for numerous reasons, including that the asset \\"valuations...in...the Settlement Agreement...were fraudulent.\\" On July 13, Greenwald issued a ruling affirming Simon & Schuster's right to continue to publish the book, and finding Mary, under her contract with Simon & Schuster, could not halt publication, that it would have been “moot” to order her to stop publication of a book that \\"has been published and distributed in great quantities\\" already. The justice also suggested the case was additionally weak because it was brought by Robert, while the book focused largely on his brother Donald, the president. Robert could have still attempted to seek monetary damages from Mary, but as of the ruling date it was uncertain if he intended to do so. Robert died one month later, on August 15.  Reception  The book received generally positive reviews. Critics praise the author for drawing on both her clinical psychologist background and knowledge of familial history to produce a standout work in the Trump tell-all genre. Jennifer Szalai of The New York Times praises the author's courage and determination, describing the book as \\"written from pain and is designed to hurt,\\" the latter part of the characterization Mary later rejects. The Los Angeles Times contrasts the book with other work on Trump's presidency, stating the empathetic manner with which the author approached the subject makes for a unique take. The Atlantic agrees with the author's observation that Donald Trump has allowed for similarly toxic family dynamics to be brought to the national stage. David Aaronovitch of The Times notes the book is in large part a biography of Fred Trump Sr., and notes that by shaping Donald definitively, the old patriarch's presence in some way looms largely over modern political history. Chris Taylor of Mashable is more critical, observing that the author makes sweeping claims while sometimes contradicting herself.

On August 24, 2019, an Aurora citizen reported to police that McClain was wearing a ski mask and looked \\"sketchy\\", although the caller also indicated that he did not believe anyone was in danger, and that he believed McClain was unarmed. The three police officers who were involved in the incident, Nathan Woodyard, Jason Rosenblatt and Randy Roedema, said that their body cameras were knocked off during a struggle with McClain. McClain was forcibly held to the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back, after which an officer applied a chokehold and paramedics administered ketamine to McClain to sedate him. While being transported to the hospital McClain went into cardiac arrest. Three days after arriving at the hospital he was declared brain dead, and he was removed from life support on August 30. McClain's autopsy was inconclusive. On June 24, 2020, after a social media outcry and Aurora lawmakers' requests for a new, third-party investigation into McClain's death, Colorado Governor Jared Polis announced his administration would reexamine the case.  Background  At the time of his death, Elijah McClain had been a massage therapist for about four years. He shared an apartment with his cousin close to the site where he was taken into police custody and consequently died. He had never been arrested or charged with a crime. Friends and family described him as a \\"spiritual seeker, pacifist, oddball, vegetarian, athlete, and peacemaker who was exceedingly gentle\\". McClain's mother Sheneen moved her family of six from Denver to Aurora to avoid gang violence, thinking it would be safer in Aurora. She said that Elijah was home schooled and she could see at an early age that he was \\"intellectually gifted, but fiercely independent\\". While still a teenager, he taught himself to play violin and guitar. During lunch breaks, he brought his instruments to animal shelters and played for the abandoned animals, believing that music put them at ease. Friends said that his gentleness with animals extended to humans as well. One of his clients recalled him as \\"the sweetest, purest person I have ever met. He was definitely a light in a whole lot of darkness\\". An acquaintance said, \\"I don't even think he would set a mouse trap if there was a rodent problem.\\"  Death  On the evening of August 24, 2019, an Aurora citizen called 9-1-1 after seeing McClain walking down the street wearing a ski mask and flailing his arms. Friends of McClain interviewed after the incident speculated that this arm-flailing was most likely just dancing, as he is believed to have been listening to music at the time of the call. The 9-1-1 caller affirmed during the call that he did not believe McClain was armed and that he did not believe that anyone, including McClain, was in immediate danger. According to the police report, McClain resisted when confronted by the responding police officers, and Officers Woodyard and Rosenblatt heard Officer Roedema shout \\"he is going for your gun\\". An attorney representing McClain's family said the officers involved slammed McClain into a wall immediately after apprehending him. Roedema said that McClain \\"reached for and grabbed the grip of Rosenblatt's gun that was holstered\\". There was no visual body-camera footage of McClain's alleged reach for the gun, which the officers explained by stating that all of their cameras had fallen off. However, the cameras continued to record audio, and one officer can be heard to say he did not remember feeling McClain go for his gun. The three police officers held McClain on the ground for 15 minutes. McClain was clearly in distress while restrained, sobbing and repeatedly saying \\"I can't breathe\\". He vomited several times, for which he apologized, saying: \\"I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to do that, I can't breathe correctly.\\" While McClain's arms were handcuffed behind his back, Woodyard applied a carotid control hold, which intentionally cuts off blood flow to the brain by compressing the carotid arteries in the neck, rendering McClain briefly unconscious. One officer threatened he would have his police dog bite McClain as he lay handcuffed and pinned to the ground. After McClain was restrained more officers arrived and audio of the conversation records them saying that McClain was \\"acting crazy\\", that he was \\"definitely on something\\", and that he had attacked them with \\"incredible, crazy strength\\" when they tried to restrain him. They also said that at one point three officers were on top of him. Paramedics injected him with 500 mg of ketamine as a sedative allowable in Colorado for a condition called excited delirium. McClain suffered a cardiac arrest while being taken to the hospital. He was pronounced brain dead on August 27 and died three days later, on August 30, 2019. The body cameras became unattached from the police officer's uniforms during the encounter, but the audio can still be heard. During the recording, when one of the body cameras was still attached to an officer, another officer can be heard telling him to move his camera. The attorney representing McClain's family accused the officers of purposely taking off their body cameras to support a false allegation that McClain reached for a gun, though this claim was never supported by any evidence during the subsequent investigation. According to a police report, the coroner could not determine the exact cause of death and therefore listed McClain's death as undetermined. Despite this, the same coroner stated that it may have been an accident resulting from an idiosyncratic drug reaction, could have been homicide if the officers' use of the carotid hold contributed to his death, or that his death also might have been caused by an asthma attack.  Last Words  According to body cam audio, these were McClain's last words as he was restrained by police officers: > I can't breathe. I have my ID right here. My name is Elijah McClain. That's > my house. I was just going home. I'm an introvert. I'm just different. > That's all. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do > any fighting. Why are you attacking me? I don't even kill flies! I don't eat > meat! But I don't judge people, I don't judge people who do eat meat. > Forgive me. All I was trying to do was become better. I will do it. I will > do anything. Sacrifice my identity, I'll do it. You all are phenomenal. You > are beautiful and I love you. Try to forgive me. I'm a mood Gemini. I'm > sorry. I'm so sorry. Ow, that really hurt! You are all very strong. Teamwork > makes the dream work. Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to do that. I just > can't breathe correctly.  Investigation = 2019  On August 28, 2019, all three Aurora Police officers involved at the scene were put on paid administrative leave. Adams County District Attorney Dave Young later determined that none of the three officers—Nathan Woodyard, Jason Rosenblatt and Randy Roedema—committed any criminal acts, and no charges were filed against them. The police body camera footage and audio of the initial 9-1-1 call were released publicly by the Aurora Police Department on November 22, 2019.  2020  In February 2020, Aurora City Manager Jim Twombly announced that he would begin a Critical Incident Review on the case to investigate how police and fire departments reacted during the incident. He also announced an audit on the body cameras of the Aurora Police Department to further investigate how well Aurora police officers comply with body camera policies. At that time he said that a review of the incident found that the force applied during the encounter was consistent with training as determined by the Force Review Board. =Petitions and investigation requests= On June 6, an online petition which called for a reopening of the investigation into the death of McClain and a request that the officers involved be removed from duty had been signed by more than 820,000 people. Members of the Aurora City Council's safety committee also requested an independent, third-party investigation into the death. County District Attorney Dave Young said he was aware of the petition and commented, \\"I don't open up investigations based on petitions.\\" On June 10, three members of the city public safety policy committee sent City Manager Jim Twombly a letter asking for a new \\"neutral, third-party\\" look at McClain's death. Twombly responded saying that the city had already initiated an independent review of his death under the direction of Eric Daigle, a former Connecticut state police officer and attorney who now consults on the use of force and related policies. Council members replied saying they were not satisfied with the city's choice of a former police officer: \\"[We] don't consider Eric Daigle to be independent and neutral due to his long career in law enforcement. We need a truly independent review.\\" On June 26, a spokesperson for the city of Aurora announced that all three officers involved in the incident had been reassigned to working in non-enforcement capacity in an attempt to protect their safety. Woodyard and Rosenblatt were moved on June 13, while Roedema was moved on June 20. By June 25, more than three million people had signed the petition demanding an independent investigation into McClain's death and on that date Governor Jared Polis appointed a special prosecutor to investigate McClain's death. He also signed an executive order directing the Attorney General, Phil Weiser, to investigate and possibly prosecute the officers involved. Polis said in a statement, \\"Elijah McClain should be alive today, and we owe it to his family to take this step and elevate the pursuit of justice in his name to a statewide concern.\\" Mari Newman, the family's attorney, commented, \\"Finally a responsible adult has stepped in and thank goodness that the governor has shown some leadership.\\" =Police Department response= On June 29, the interim police chief announced that multiple officers had been placed on administrative leave and were under investigation after photos of them surfaced that had been taken near the site where McClain died. The photos, taken in October 2019, show police officers posing inappropriately and reenacting the carotid restraint used on McClain before his death. In July, three officers were fired from the department in relation to the photos, while one officer resigned. At a news conference acting police chief Vanessa Wilson said, \\"While the allegations of this internal affairs case are not criminal, they are a crime against humanity and decency. To even think about doing such a thing is beyond comprehension and it is reprehensible.\\" In response to a question from the floor, she addressed aspects of future officer training, and noted: \\"I shouldn't have to teach this. There is no training that should [have to] teach human decency.\\" Commentary In Colorado EMS providers are allowed to use ketamine to treat a syndrome known as excited delirium. When the EMS arrived on the scene of the encounter McClain was already cuffed and restrained on the ground. One of the officers can be heard telling the EMS that McClain was \\"acting crazy\\", that he was \\"definitely on something\\", and that he had attacked them with \\"incredible, crazy strength\\" when they tried to restrain him. Estimating that McClain weighed 220 pounds (100 kg), the medic gave him an injection of 500 mg of ketamine. According to information provided to NBC by Aurora Fire Rescue, the standard dose of ketamine is 5 milligrams per each kilogram of a person's weight. The coroner's report states that McClain was tall and weighed . That would mean that he should have received about 320 milligrams. The attorney for McClain's family, Mari Newman, says that medics had no right or reason to inject Elijah with ketamine and has asked for an investigation. Neuroscientist Carl Hart, chair of Columbia University's psychology department, commented, \\"Why anyone would be giving ketamine in that circumstance is beyond me.\\" Carl Takei, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who focuses on police practices, said \\"ascribing a person's actions to excited delirium can create a shield for officers who use excessive force\\". Protests and memorials A very small protest was held in November 2019 in response to the District Attorney's decision not to file charges. McClain's mother Sheneen was scheduled to take part but was in too much grief to appear and speak. A second event for McClain was held on June 6, 2020, after the death of George Floyd led to the formation of a nationwide protest movement in the United States. One of the event organizers remarked that the McClain family must have felt that the death of their loved one had been in vain when they saw the streets of Denver filled with protesters showing support for George Floyd while their loved one seemed to have been all but forgotten. One speaker said, \\"Today, I see all of your faces. And although it happened because of George Floyd, if we're not dealing with the atrocities, with the murders, with the brutality inside of Aurora, we have no business shouting another person's name.\\" In June 2020, a memorial mural was painted in honor of McClain in Denver, Colorado, alongside murals of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. June 27 protest On June 27, 2020, thousands of people gathered for a day of protests, speaker presentations, and an evening violin concert at Aurora City Center Park. Before the protest began, Aurora police issued a statement in support of a peaceful protest but warned of \\"outsiders\\" whose goal, they said, is to be destructive. Government buildings were boarded up, and police sat atop City Hall and the library observing the protest. No arrests were reported during the day, although both directions of Interstate 225 highway were shut down around 3 p.m. by thousands of marching protesters. In the evening people, including families with children, began to gather in City Center Park and musicians formed a circle and began to play a violin concert in honor of McClain, who was known to be an accomplished player. At that time the police announced that the protest was now an \\"illegal gathering\\", and ordered people to leave the park or they would use pepper spray to disperse them. Shortly thereafter the police, dressed in riot gear, moved into the crowd. Several attendees reported smoke and gas canisters were used. A police statement later reported that \\"pepper spray was used after a small group of people gathered rocks [and] sticks, knocked over a fence, & ignored orders to move back\\". Various videos showed attendees seated on the public lawn without any such actions. Five attendees of the protest have sued the Aurora Police Department and its interim chief, accusing them of unconstitutional treatment. Their lawsuit also demands that the Aurora Police Department stop using chemical agents, stop shooting projectiles indiscriminately into crowds, only allow crowd dispersal when there is an urgent danger to other people, and require all police to have their body cameras on at all times.

In December 2010, Pérez Tello was nominated by her party as Kuczynski's second running-mate in the coalition, alongside the non-partisan former Vice President, Máximo San Román, as first running mate. The coalition ran a strong campaign, but failed to qualify for the run-off, placing third behind Keiko Fujimori and Ollanta Humala.

Early life  Edna Jackson was born in Salina, Kansas and raised in Sheridan, Wyoming, the daughter of William Edward Jackson. She graduated from the Colorado College of Osteopathy in 1905. She was a charter member of the Sheridan chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star.  Career  Carver had an osteopathic practice in Denver, and invested in land there. She also practiced in New York City for six years. In 1913, she spoke at the International Congress of Farm Women in Tulsa, on the subject \\"Keeping the Right Mental Attitude\\", telling her audience, \\"It is a great thing to earn a living, but it is a greater thing to live a life.\\" She was the physician and head chaperone on a film company's publicity train trip in 1915, called the \\"American Beauty Special\\"; it ran from Chicago to Los Angeles, filled with beauty contest winners hoping for a screen test in Hollywood.\\"An American Beauty Special\\" Santa Fe Magazine (June 1915): 68. Carver became the owner of Steamboat Hot Springs in 1918. She rebuilt the lodgings and bathing facilities, and opened it as a health spa in 1919. She drilled deep wells to access additional springs, and welcomed athletes and racehorses for rehabilitation. In the 1940s, after several fires damaged buildings on the campus of the facility, she worked with architect Paul Revere Williams on a plan for the expansion and modernization of the resort, but that vision was never realized. Away from Steamboat Springs, Carver was a frequent speaker and leader at the Unity Center church in Reno. She also took an active interest in education, and served as president of the Reno school board in the 1930s. In 1933 she attended a national social science convention in Detroit. In 1934 she spoke about polio at a parent-teacher meeting in Sparks. In 1936, she helped to treat injured fellow passengers when their train encountered an avalanche.  Personal life  Edna Jackson married English-born Edward Towne; they had a son, Dural Edward Towne (1899-1960). She lived for many years with Blanch Foltz, who died in 1953. Edna Carver died in 1954, in Steamboat Springs, and left the springs property to her son. Her daughter-in-law Dorothy A. Towne, a nurse, ran the spa from 1962 until 1986, when she donated it to a local church.

Life Androzzi was born in 1523 in Montecchio (since renamed Treia), in the province of Macerata. He bore the title doctor of both laws, probably having graduated from the University of Camerino, and became vicar general to Berardo Bongiovanni, Bishop of Camerino, and was appointed to a canonry in the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto.Alberto Merola, \\"Androzi, Fulvio\\", Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 3 (1961). In December 1555 he joined the Society of Jesus, founded just 15 years previously, and returned to Marche as an itinerant missionary. From late 1557 he was rector of the Jesuit college in Florence, and from 1561 of the college in Ferrara. He was professed of the fourth vow in Ferrara on 14 September 1562. He was active helping victims of the plague in 1570–1571, and began the extension of the college buildings (completed in 1580). He died in Ferrara on 27 August 1575. Writings After Androzzi's death, his manuscript writings were prepared for publication by Francesco Adorno, rector of the Jesuit college in Padua, and were printed in Milan at the press of Pacifico Pontio in 1579, under the title Opere spirituali del R.

This technique provides information from an electrochemical and spectroscopic point of view. In this way, it enables a better perception about the chemical system of interest. On one hand, molecular information related to the electronic levels of the molecules is obtained from the evolution of the spectra. On the other hand, kinetic and thermodynamic information of the processes is obtained from the electrochemical signal. UV-Vis absorption SEC allows qualitative analysis, through the characterization of the different present compounds, and quantitative analysis, by determining the concentration of the analytes of interest. Furthermore, it helps to determine different electrochemical parameters such as absorptivity coefficients, standard potentials, diffusion coefficients, electronic transfer rate constants, etc. Throughout history, reversible processes have been studied with colored reagents or electrolysis products. Nowadays, it is possible to study all kinds of electrochemical processes in the entire UV-Vis spectral range, even in the near infrared (NIR).  Configuration  In UV-Vis absorption SEC, depending on the configuration of the light beam respect to the electrode/solution interface, two types of optical arrangements can be distinguished: normal and parallel configuration.  Normal configuration  In normal configuration, the light beam samples perpendicularly the electrode surface. Normal configuration provides optical information related to the changes that take place in the solution adjacent to the electrode and on the electrode surface. The optical path length coincides with the diffusion layer thickness, which is usually in the order of micrometers. This arrangement is the most suitable when the compound of interest is deposited or adsorbed on the working electrode, because it provides information about all processes occurring on the electrode surface. UV-Vis absorption SEC in normal arrangement can be performed using both transmission and reflection phenomena. * Normal transmission In normal transmission, the light beam passes through a optically transparent working electrode, collecting information about the phenomena that take place on the surface of the electrode and on the solution adjacent to it. Electrodes in this configuration must be composed of materials that have great electrical conductivity and adequate optical transparency in the spectral region of interest. The external reflection mode was proposed to improve the sensitivity and to use non-transparent electrodes. Normal transmission scheme * Normal reflection In normal reflection, the light beam travels in a perpendicular direction to the working electrode surface on which the reflection occurs. The reflected beam is collected to be analyzed in the spectrometer. It is also possible to work with other incidence and collection angles. This configuration is an alternative when the working electrode is non-transparent. In this configuration, the optical path-length in solution is on the order of twice the diffusion layer thickness. It should be noticed that growth of films on the electrode surface could cause optical interference phenomena. As it is based on reflection phenomenon, in many cases reflectance is used as unit of measurement instead of absorbance. Normal reflection scheme  Parallel or long optical path-length configuration  The parallel configuration or long optical path-length arrangement only provides information about the spectral changes that occur in the solution adjacent to the working electrode surface, improving the sensitivity to soluble compounds because the length of the optical pathway can be as longer as the length of the electrode. The light beam travels parallel to the working electrode surface, sampling the first micrometers of the solution adjacent to the working electrode surface, and collecting the information on the spectrometer. Parallel configuration scheme Usually, aligning light beams has been a difficult task. However, simple alternatives have been developed to perform measurements in parallel configuration. There are several advantages in this configuration respect to the normal one: better sensitivity, lower detection limits; optically transparent electrodes are not required; and the spectral changes are related only to the diffusion layer.  Instrumentation  The experimental set-up used to carry out UV-Vis absorption SEC measurements depends on the chosen configuration and the characteristics of the analyte. The experimental set-up is composed of a light source, a spectrometer, a potentiostat/galvanostat, a SEC cell, a three-electrode system, optical elements to conduct the light beam, and a computer for data collection and analysis. Currently, there are commercial devices that integrate all these elements in a single instrument, simplifying significantly the SEC experiments. * Light source: provides the electromagnetic radiation that interacts with the sample while the electrochemical process is taking place. A specific source is required for the UV-Vis spectral region, being the most common the deuterium/halogen lamp. * Spectrometer: instrument that allows measuring the properties of the light in a certain region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It uses a monochromator to separate the different spectral wavelengths of interest emitted by the light source. A diode-array detector can be used to obtain time-resolved spectra. For UV-Vis spectroelectrochemistry, spectrometer must be specific for UV-Vis spectral region. * Potentiostat/Galvanostat: electronic device that allows controlling the working electrode potential regarding to the reference electrode or controlling the current that passes respect to the auxiliary electrode. * Three electrode system: consists of a working electrode, a reference electrode and an auxiliary electrode. This system can be simplified by using screen- printed electrodes that include the three electrodes on a single holder. * Spectroelectrochemical cell: device in which the solution and the system of three electrodes is located, avoiding possible interference in the optical path. It is the link between the electrochemistry and the UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. * Devices to conduct the radiation beam: lenses, mirrors and/or optical fibers. The last ones conduct electromagnetic radiation over great distances with hardly any losses. In addition, they simplify the optical configurations because they allow working with a small amount of solution. Optical fibers make easier to conduct and collect light near the electrode. * Analysis and data collection devices: a computer collects the signals provided by the spectrometer and potentiostat that, using a suitable software, treats, analyzes and interprets the signals.  Applications  UV-Vis absorption SEC is a recent technique that is continuously evolving. However, many advantages have been observed over other techniques. The most outstanding advantages are: * It generates a large amount of information about the systems. * Generally, solvents are not a problem when carrying out these kinds of measurements. * The wavelength selection generates specificity in the measurement of each species. * Currently, there are commercial devices that allow carrying out a large number of experiments with high reproducibility. * The kinetics of the reactions can be studied. * It is used to determine a large number of electrochemical and optical parameters. * Trilinear signals are obtained. * Small amounts of sample can be analyzed. * Faradaic current can be separated from non-faradaic current in an electrode process. * It is more specific than electrochemistry. * Quantitative information can be obtained. UV-Vis absorption SEC has been used mainly in different research fields such as: * Sensor development. * Reaction mechanisms. * Diffusion and adsorption processes. * Characterization of compounds. * Study of biological interest substances. * Study of optical and electrical materials properties. * Study of liquid/liquid interfaces. * Study and synthesis of nanomaterials. * Evaluation of reaction parameters in which electron transfer occurs.

Santos, Ressa and Rappler (R-MNL-19-01141-CR), also known as the Maria Ressa cyberlibel case, is a high-profile criminal case in the Philippines, lodged against Maria Ressa, co-owner and CEO of Rappler, Inc. Accused of cyberlibel, Ressa was found guilty by Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 46 judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa on June 15, 2020. She is the second person in the Philippines to be found criminally liable for the offense. The case centered on an article published on Rappler by Reynaldo Santos, Jr. which accused the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines of accepting favors from Filipino-Chinese businessman Wilfredo Keng. Santos, Ressa, and others were charged with cyberlibel retrospectively; the article had been published four months before the law came into force. Following her conviction, Ressa announced her intention to appeal to the Court of Appeals and, if necessary, the Supreme Court. Rappler Inc., as a corporation, was not found liable; Santos, however, as author, was. Ressa, in her capacity of Rappler's chief executive officer, was also found liable. By the time Santos was charged, he was no longer working as a journalist. The court ruled that Ressa \\"did not offer a scintilla of proof that they verified the imputations of various crimes in the disputed article... [Rappler] just simply published them as news in their online publication in reckless disregard of whether they are false or not.\\" The judgement also argued that Ressa had deliberately called herself an executive editor, rather than editor- in-chief, in an attempt to avoid liability. The ruling was criticised by human rights groups, with the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights describing the case as part of a \\"pattern of intimidation\\" against the Philippine press.  Background  Maria Ressa was one of those found guilty of cyberlibel as a result of People v. Santos, et al. The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (R.A. 10175) was signed into law by President Benigno Aquino III on September 12, 2012, and it went into force on October 3. Among the actions criminalized by this law is \\"cyberlibel\\". Six days after the law commenced, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order to stop its implementation. The Supreme Court lifted this restraining order on February 18, 2014, and upheld most of the sections of the law including the cyberlibel component. Rappler is a Filipino news website that was founded in 2012. It is online-only, but has an editorial process and its news articles are written by journalists.As in other publications, op-eds may be written by anyone the editors feel has a noteworthy opinion. Since Rappler's founding, its CEO and executive editor has been Maria Ressa, who was featured as one of Time's 2018 Peoples of the Year.Ressa was one of a group honored in 2018; despite the name, it is not a singular honor. On May 29, 2012, Rappler reporter Reynaldo Santos, Jr. published an article titled \\"CJ using SUVs of 'controversial' businessmen\\". Among those named in the article is Wilfredo Keng, one of the richest businessmen in the Philippines. The article details Keng's involvement in a controversy surrounding former Chief Justice Renato Corona, who was later impeached. , the article remains online. Santos, Jr.'s article primarily relied on a 2002 Philippine Star article titled \\"Influential businessman eyed in ex-councilor's slay\\" as a source. It also relied on an \\"intelligence report\\" prepared that same year by the National Security Council, which the article says implicated Keng in human trafficking and drug smuggling. This report, however, was not presented to the Court as evidence. On February 16, 2019, although the Star believed that it had the right to keep the article online, it chose to voluntarily take the article down after Keng threatened it too with legal action. Despite the conviction, Santos Jr. \\"stands behind\\" his story. On December 20, 2017, Keng filed a complaint-affidavit before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to charge Santos, Jr. and Ressa, along with Rappler's treasurer James Bitanga and six others, with cyberlibel. The NBI's Cybercrime Department was originally sympathetic, even though the law was passed after the supposed crime, as their legal department believed that a theory of \\"continuous publication\\" still made the offense chargeable. That is to say, that because the article was still online, the server was \\"publishing\\" it again whenever it was accessed, similar to print-on-demand for print works. The NBI, however, reversed and decided not to charge Rappler. The Department of Justice (DOJ) later took up the case and recommended the charges be filed. The DOJ reasoned that on February 19, 2014, a single word was changed in the article: was replaced with \\"evasion\\". When Rappler fixed a typo in the story, this counted as re-publication, so the charges could go ahead. Another issue that the DOJ opined on was the prescriptive period.Equal to the American concept of a \\"statute of limitations\\". Regular libel has a prescriptive period of one year in the Philippines, but R.A. 10175 does not define a prescriptive period for cyberlibel. Therefore, the DOJ reasoned that it must be twelve years, as Act No. 3326 (1926) defines.Although the Philippines was an American colony in 1926, laws from the American colonial period are still considered valid as long as they haven't been repealed by the modern Congress, or any previous Philippine legislature like the unicameral Regular Batasang Pambansa. While there was a temporary restraining order against implementation of R.A. 10175, the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Disini v. Secretary of Justice made the law go into effect as scheduled on October 3, 2012. The DOJ later dropped Bitanga and the six others from the complaint, as their \\"part in the publication [had not been] established\\". Maria Ressa was arrested on the night of February 13, 2019, and spent that night in jail before being released on bail the next morning. Ressa alleges that she was purposely arrested at night so that she could not bail herself out in a timely manner. As of March 2019, Ressa has paid more than in bail and travel bonds, the latter of which Ressa's camp labeled as \\"excessive\\". If all of the cases filed against Ressa up to June 18, 2020, were to result in guilty verdicts after final appeal, and the sentences were all to run consecutively, she would face around 100 years in prison. People v. Santos, et al. is one of multiple legal cases filed by various government agencies against Rappler. Other cases allege ownership irregularitiesSee also: . and tax evasion. Both Ressa and Chel Diokno, a human rights attorney who also represents Rappler, connect a statement made by President Duterte during his 2017 State of the Nation Address to the outpour of legal cases against Rappler from the executive branch.  Trial  Ressa and Santos Jr. were arraigned on May 13, 2019. Their trial began on July 23, 2019. Although prosecuted in the name of the \\"People of the Philippines\\", private prosecutors from three different law firms argued on behalf of convicting Ressa and Santos, Jr. personally on behalf of, and on the payroll of, Keng: these prosecutors were seasoned attorneys who had previously defended both drug lord Peter Lim and Sen. Bong Revilla, accused and acquitted of plunder before the Sandiganbayan. Private prosecutors are allowed in the Philippines as a result of a change to the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure enacted by the Supreme Court in 2002. Ressa and Santos Jr. were represented by attorneys Theodore Te (of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG), the largest organization of Filipino human rights lawyers) and . In the lead-up to the trial, Ressa's attorneys tried several times to achieve dismissal via motions to quash (February 2019), motions to dismiss (April 2019), and demurrers (November 2019), but all such motions were denied by the Court. The verdict was originally scheduled for April 3, 2020, but it was delayed due to COVID-19. On the advice of counsel, neither Ressa nor Santos Jr. testified in their own defense.As in other nations, there is a Constitutional protection in the Philippines that gives people the right not to be a witness against themselves. See:  Verdict  After an eight-month trial, \\"[which] could [have been] the quickest libel trial in recent history\\" according to Rappler, Ressa and Santos, Jr. were both found guilty of criminal cyberlibel by Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 46 judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa. The verdict was handed down on June 15, 2020. Although corporate liability against Rappler Inc. had been sought, the judge ruled that there was no corporate liability in this case. They were both sentenced to between six months and six years in prison,Known in Philippine law as prisión correcional. See . but are entitled to bail while they have appeals pending in higher courts. They were also both assessed fines of for combined \\"moral damages\\" and \\"exemplary damages\\". In its ruling, the Court said that Ressa \\"did not offer a scintilla of proof that they verified the imputations of various crimes in the disputed article. [...] They just simply published them as news in their online publication in reckless disregard of whether they are false or not\\"; it also accused Ressa of committing a \\"clever ruse\\" by not calling herself an editor-in-chief, but rather an executive editor, to avoid libel liability. Journalists criticized the judge for this stance as \\"executive editor\\" is a common title at many publications; the title is not exclusive to Rappler. The Court also drew an adverse inference from Ressa and Santos Jr.'s refusal to testify, relying on the precedent of People v. Resano ( No. L-57738), which states that defendants \\"owe it to themselves\\" to testify if they are \\"in the best position to refute [the] charges\\" as there may be no other way to affect \\"the complete destruction of the prosecution's prima facie case\\". The ruling was handed down in person, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and general community quarantine. The clerk of court, judge, defendants, complainant Keng, along with one lawyer from each firm, were in attendance. Judge Estacio-Montesa ordered her clerk to first read out her fallo, which read in part, \\"there is no curtailment of the right to freedom of speech and of the press\\", before the Court's ruling. After the verdict, a \\"vindicated\\" Keng sued Ressa again for a different count of cyberlibel, this time over a tweet she wrote on February 15, 2019, which contained a screenshot of the 2002 Philippine Star article discussed in. Keng stated that by republishing the article \\"[Ressa] feloniously communicated the malicious imputations against me not only to her 350,000 Twitter followers, but to anyone who has access to the internet.\\"  Appeal  Santos, Jr. and Ressa have the right to file an appeal, first in the Court of Appeals, and then in the Supreme Court. Should they prevail in the Court of Appeals, Keng and the government would have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Ressa plans to appeal, both on her own behalf and on the behalf of Santos, Jr., who Rappler Inc. is covering the legal costs of. They have fifteen days to file their appeal, and may also file a motion for reconsideration before the Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC). At appeal, questions of law are most important. One question of law that could be brought up at appeal is a question about the prescriptive period. In Disini v. Secretary of Justice, the Court ruled that \\"cyberlibel is actually not a new crime since Article 353, in relation to Article 355 of the [Revised Penal Code], already punishes it. In effect, Section 4(c)(4) above merely affirms that online defamation constitutes \\"similar means\\" for committing libel.\\" So, it could be questioned whether or not the prescriptive period is also equal to libel under the Revised Penal Code. While a question not raised at the Regional Trial Court level may not be raised at the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals is able to consider the facts anew. The Supreme Court, however, is not generally a \\"trier of facts\\", so will only be able to consider questions of law.  Reactions  Reaction to the case was mixed. Before the verdict in April 2020, Reporters Without Borders' annual Press Freedom Index report ranked the Philippines 136 out of 180 countries in terms of press freedom. Historically, since the end of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippines was regarded as having one of the most free presses in Asia. People v. Santos, et al. is one of multiple legal cases filed by various government agencies against Rappler. Collectively, these have been described by The Guardian and Reporters Without Borders as \\"judicial harassment\\". Leni Robredo, Vice President of the Philippines and leader of the opposition,In the Philippines, president and vice president are elected separately, and can be of opposing parties. argued that the verdict was intended as an instruction to the opposition to \\"keep quiet\\". Hillary Clinton echoed a similar sentiment; while Madeleine Albright said she \\"stands with Maria Ressa\\". The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) declared that the verdict \\"basically kills freedom of speech and of the press\\" and has led to a \\"dark day ... for all Filipinos.\\" , the cybercrime lawyer who brought Disini v. Secretary of Justice in an attempt to see the law overturned by the Supreme Court of the Philippines, criticized the verdict. The United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights suggested that the case was part of a \\"pattern of intimidation\\" against the Philippine press, while Amnesty International called on the judiciary to quash the cases, as did Human Rights Watch. A group of United States Senators called the verdict a \\"travesty of justice\\" that \\"set dangerous precedents\\". The European External Action Service, the diplomatic corps of the European Union, commented that the verdict \\"raises serious doubts over the respect for freedom of expression as well as for the rule of law in the Philippines.\\" This sentiment was echoed by David Kaye, a United Nations special rapporteur. The US Department of State's response expressed \\"concern\\" over the verdict, to which MalacañangUsed here with the same meaning as using \\"the White House\\" to refer to the administration of the current American president. reacted negatively, warning of another possible \\"setback\\" in diplomatic relations if the State Department continued to, in its words, \\"interfere\\". Harry Roque, President Duterte's official spokesman suggested the law's origins were under former President Aquino, as it was passed by his administration. Roque had previously been a petitioner in Disini v. Sec'y of Justice which attempted to have cyberlibel removed as an offence. Roque also emphasized that the prosecution of Rappler is not politically motivated, and has urged people to \\"respect\\" the ruling. He has also argued that in 2008 Duterte, as mayor of Davao, had helped a journalist jailed on a libel charge, and that Duterte does not prosecute journalists who make accusations against him. Roque stated that Duterte's appointment of Keng's daughter, Patricia Anne C. Keng, as a member of the Philippine Commission on Women on September 19, 2019 did not affect the integrity of the verdict against Ressa.

Population history The species was heavily exploited and completely eliminated over much of its original range. Trampling of nests by feral donkeys, and the predation of hatchlings by feral dogs decimated populations, but the breeding program has led to successful releases. Fencing of nests and dog eradication in the 1970s helped in the population recovery.Cayot 1994. Conservation biology of Galápagos reptiles: twenty-five years of successful research and management.

In a census conducted in November 2016, the population was found to be making a rapid recovery. A total of around 6,700 individuals were found, with around 2,700 mature adults and 3,750 juveniles. Description It has a wide, black shell, its shape intermediate between the saddle-backed and domed species: adult males are rather saddle-backed, but females and young males are wider in the middle and more domed. A now-extinct, more flat-shelled form occurred throughout the wetter and higher regions of the island most altered by man when the island was colonized. The type specimen was from this extinct population, so it is possible that the species currently designated C. chathamensis is mistakenly applied.

Basir was nicknamed \\"Uncle Tabrak\\" and was of Indian descent.  Life  Basir was born in Jacklow, a village near the Pomeroon River in Guyana. He was schooled at the Jacklow Anglican Primary School in his earlier years and later went to a private secondary school in another town. He then returned to Jacklow, where he managed a compound that produced coconut and rice. During this period, Basir studied dentistry overseas at Bennett College. Around 1960, Basir married Sabra Karim, with whom he had six children. After marriage, the couple moved to the Essequibo Coast where Basir worked as an assistant distiller at the Uitvlugt Distillery.  Political career  While at the Uitvlugt Distillery, Basir met Harripersaud Nokta and C. V. Nunes, members of the People's Progressive Party of Guyana (PPP) who encouraged him to join. Basir did and became an activist for the PPP, travelling across Guyana to rally for the party. In 1976, one year after he moved to Hampton Court with Sabra Karim and his children, he was shot five times on a trip that he was invited to by Cheddi Jagan but survived. The shooter, a police officer, remains unknown, and no one has been tried for attempted murder. In January 1977, he was elected to the National Assembly of Guyana as a Minister of Agriculture. He ran again for Minister in 1985, and, during the vote-counting, was told to keep away from the place where the ballot boxes were stored. Similar experiences happened to other PPP candidates, such as Region 5’s Navin Chandarpal, during that election, and today it is suspected that the political party that was then in power, the People's National Congress, was rigging the 1985 election by not allowing anyone to see the vote. Basir’s political career ended in 1991, when a furious Basir threw a glass of water at Speaker Sase Narain and removed the ceremonial mace from its proper place. This was in protest of Narian's interruption of a motion proposed by Cheddi Jagan to prolong the term of the parliament. This resulted in the first-ever expulsion from the National Assembly of Guyana.  Final years and death  The Cheddi Jagan Bio Diversity Park in 2010. After his career in politics, Basir worked at the Essequibo Technical Institute as an advisor to the Local Administration and Board of Governors. He also worked as a journalist and as the manager of a 1,500-acre rice land for the Government of Libya. In 1994, Basir was awarded the Cacique Crown of Honour for his activism. After Cheddi Jagan's 1997 death, Basir spoke out for Jagan's policies and platforms. In 2001, he urged the PPP to adopt Jagan's theories in a letter. That same year, he established the Cheddi Jagan Bio Diversity Park as a memorial to Jagan. Basir was a member of the PPP's Central Committee even after his career in politics. In 2002, President and PPP leader Bharrat Jagdeo announced Basir would no longer be a member of the committee. He was denied a pension. Shortly before his death, Basir was present at a town hall meeting in his region where he informed visitors of the meeting about the use of oil in Guyana. Basir died on 1 February 2019 of heart failure. His funeral was attended by Donald and Deolatchmee Ramotar, former President and First Lady of Guyana, Moses Nagamootoo, the Prime Minister of Guyana, and Harripersaud Nokta. After Basir's death, the Indian Action Committee, a Guyanese organization based in the city of Georgetown, announced plans for a statue of Basir to be built in Essequibo. One Guyanese politician, Devanand Ramdatt, suggested that a museum be named after Basir in his honour.

Designed by Solon Borglum, the statue was dedicated on May 25, 1907 to large fanfare. The statue has recently become a figure of controversy over Gordon's racist views, with some calling for its removal.  History = Background and creation  John Brown Gordon statue in front of the Georgia State Capitol John Brown Gordon was a noted Confederate general during the American Civil War who served multiple terms as a Senator from Georgia and as Governor of Georgia in the post-Reconstruction era. He was also generally recognized as the leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia and supported the institution of slavery. Following his death on January 9, 1904, multiple civic leaders in Atlanta began to plan a monument in his honor. On January 19, 1904 (Robert E. Lee Day), a meeting at the Georgia State Capitol of groups including the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the United Confederate Veterans was held where Clement A. Evans proposed creating a statue to honor Gordon. A John B. Gordon Monument Association was formed for this purpose, led by William Lowndes Calhoun as its president. While the association was successful in fundraising, a total of $25,000 had to be secured from the state government in order to complete the project. Solon Borglum (whose brother Gutzon Borglum was the first sculptor to work on the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial) was commissioned to design an equestrian statue of Gordon, which would rest on a pedestal designed by Alexander Campbell Bruce and supplied by the McNeel Marble Works. The statue, which at the time was Atlanta's only equestrian statue, was dedicated on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol on May 25, 1907. Evans served as the main orator for the unveiling. During the dedication, Governor Joseph M. Terrell and another speaker called for the erection of additional monuments on the Capitol grounds for Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, and the \\"common soldier\\", but budgetary issues prevented these plans from coming to fruition. The statue's unveiling attracted many onlookers, and contemporary accounts mention a choir singing \\"Dixie\\" to loud cheers during the ceremony. The event took place less than a year after the Atlanta race riot.  Calls for removal  Georgia National Guard near the statue of Brown on May 31, 2020 Recently, the statue has come under criticism due to Gordon's stance on race. Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, a state senator proposed a law forbidding the official recognition of Confederate symbols, including icons such as the Gordon statue. Around the same time, American historian Kenneth W. Noe, speaking with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, spoke directly about the Gordon statue and others on the Capitol grounds as symbols of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. In 2019, the government of Georgia passed a law barring the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. During the George Floyd protests in 2020, many protesters called for the removal of the statue, prompting a trending hashtag on Twitter, #TEARDOWNGORDON. On June 8, Bob Trammell, the minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, sent a letter to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp asking him to remove the statue of Gordon, saying, \\"the statue's nexus to hate in our state is overwhelming\\" and \\"its presence is both divisive and offensive.\\" Protests regarding the statue and others prompted a barricade to be erected around the Capitol grounds. On June 11, a protester was arrested for vandalizing the statue, writing \\"tear down\\" with chalk on the monument. Following these events, 44 descendants of Gordon sent an open letter to Governor Kemp calling for the removal of the statue from the Capitol grounds, stating that \\"the primary purpose of the statue was to celebrate and mythologize the white supremacists of the Confederacy\\".  Design  The monument consists of a bronze equestrian statue of Gordon resting on a pedestal inscribed with his last name. The horse is Marye, Gordon's warhorse during the Civil War. Gordon is dressed in his Confederate uniform, but is depicted as an elderly man.

It was the first Nigerian film to gross one million naira in ticket sales at the National Arts Theatre, the largest and most prestigious cinema in Nigeria at the time. Iyawo Alhaji was the first commercial video film to be censored by the newly established Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) in 1994. It was a regular practice for Alabi-Hundeyin's films, including his next, Ami Orun (1996) (starring Sola Fosudo, Clarion Chukwura- Abiola), to have extended days at the film theatre as crowds could not get tickets to watch during the initially advertised dates.

It was reported that the best scene he ever filmed was in Ireke Onibudo.

By sunrise, the actor, wearing a long white robe with a dropping white beard, spread out his arms in the air while off-camera the production manager, Segun Akpata, and the art director, Pat Nebo, threw up white doves behind him. The doves rose up behind Olodumare, all flying around and away until one flew around his head and descended on his outstretched hand.

The regiment was formed from men recruited by Jeremiah V. Cockrell and Sidney D. Jackman during an expedition into Missouri in August 1862. Although the recruits fought at the Battle of Lone Jack on August 16, they were not officially mustered into Confederate service until August 31. The regiment fought at the Battle of Prairie Grove on December 7. In May 1863, the regiment was designated the 7th Missouri Infantry Regiment, although this designation was changed to the 16th Missouri Infantry Regiment in December. On July 4, the regiment fought at the Battle of Helena, suffering heavy casualties. The unit then spent time building fortifications at Little Rock, Arkansas, before leaving the town in September. The 16th Missouri then fought at the Battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, 1864, and at the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry on April 30. On June 8, 1865, the men of the regiment were paroled and sent back to Missouri via steamboat. More men died while serving in the 16th Missouri Infantry Regiment than died in any other Missouri unit serving in the Confederate States Army. Organization Sidney D. Jackman During the middle of 1862, Jeremiah V. Cockrell and Sidney D. Jackman attempted to recruit men for a cavalry regiment in northwestern Arkansas. Because Cockrell and Jackman were unable to recruit enough men to form a regiment in Arkansas, the two men, accompanied by other recruiters, entered Missouri on August 1. After recruiting a number of men, Cockrell and Jackman established a camp near Lone Jack, Missouri on August 15. On August 16, Cockrell's force engaged a Union column commanded by Major Emory S. Foster as part of the Battle of Lone Jack. After a five-hour battle, the Union forces were defeated and forced to withdraw. Foster was severely wounded and captured. Jackman and Cockrell's recruits suffered at least 46 casualties at Lone Jack. More Union troops came to the area, and the Confederates withdrew back into Arkansas. On August 31, the unit of recruits officially mustered into the Confederate States Army, while in the vicinity of Fayetteville, Arkansas as infantry. Cockrell returned to Missouri to continue recruiting cavalrymen, and Jackman became the first colonel of the regiment, which bore his name. Levin Major Lewis was the regiment's first lieutenant colonel, and Pleasant W. H. Cumming was the first major. As of the date of muster, the regiment's company organization was: * Company A: Clay County, Jackson County, Johnson County, and Monroe County. * Company B: Benton County and St. Clair County. * Company C: Bates County, Boone County, Callaway County, and Johnson County. * Company D: Johnson County. * Company E: Newton County. * Company F: Henry County and Johnson County. * Company G: Dade County. * Company H: McDonald County. * Company I: Bates County and Henry County. * Company K: Henry County. Service history=1862 Jackman resigned on September 25 to return to Missouri to continue recruiting; Jackman was replaced as commander of the regiment by Josiah H. Caldwell. On December 7, the regiment fought in the Battle of Prairie Grove as part of Brigadier General Mosby M. Parsons' brigade. Early in the fighting at Prairie Grove, Parsons' Brigade was aligned to support the Confederate left flank; the regiment (now known as Caldwell's Missouri Regiment) was on the left flank of Parsons' line. Later in the battle, Parsons' Brigade attacked a portion of Major General James G. Blunt's division. Parsons outflanked Blunt, and the Union troops were forced back. However, when a further attack was pressed against the Union line, Caldwell's Regiment was squeezed out by Parsons' advancing regiments and could not participate in the second charge. The regiment suffered 48 casualties at Prairie Grove. The Confederate army then fell back from Prairie Grove, and encamped at Van Buren, Arkansas. 1863 Map of the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War In January 1863, the regiment transferred from Van Buren to Little Rock, Arkansas. The next several months saw an outbreak of disease in the regiment, which took the lives of over 100 men. Colonel Caldwell resigned on March 23 and was replaced by Lewis. On May 3, the regiment was officially designated the 7th Missouri Infantry Regiment by special order of Major General Sterling Price. In late June, the regiment began moving towards Helena, Arkansas, although high water slowed the movement. During the Battle of Helena on July 4, the regiment, along with the rest of Parsons' Brigade, assaulted the Union defenses at Helena at a point known as Graveyard Hill. Parsons' charge was successful, but the rest of the Confederate assaults were repulsed, allowing Union troops to focus on Parsons' Brigade. After five hours of fighting, Parsons' Brigade was driven back with heavy losses, including many prisoners taken. At Helena, the 7th Missouri suffered 194 casualties; only 325 men remained in the regiment on July 6. Colonel Lewis was wounded and captured at Helena; Cumming replaced him as commander of the regiment. After the debacle at Helena, the regiment returned to Little Rock, where it built defensive positions north of the city. Major General Frederick Steele's Union force advanced against Little Rock, but avoided the fortifications by attacking from the southeast. Parsons' Brigade left Little Rock on September 10 and transferred to the vicinity of Arkadelphia, Arkansas. On December 15, the regiment was renamed the 16th Missouri Infantry Regiment by order of Price's headquarters. 18641865 The 16th Missouri spent late 1864 in southern Arkansas. In March, Parsons was elevated to division command. His division contained the brigades of Colonels Simon P. Burns and John Bullock Clark Jr.; the 16th Missouri was in Burns' Brigade. Parsons' Division was sent to the aid of Major General Richard Taylor, who was threatened by a Union advance up the Red River; the troops reach Taylor on April 9. Later that day, the regiment participated in the Battle of Pleasant Hill. Parsons' Division, which was on the right flank of the Confederate line, attacked the Union line. The attack was initially successful, driving in part of the Union line, but a Union counterattack defeated the Confederates, who retreated in some disarray. The 16th Missouri lost 25 men at Pleasant Hill. Parsons' Division then moved north to Camden, Arkansas, where a Union force commanded by Steele was positioned. Steele retreated in the face of the Confederate advance, but was caught by the Confederates at the crossing of the Saline River at Jenkins' Ferry. At the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry on April 30, the 16th Missouri was still part of Burns' Brigade, along with the 10th Missouri Infantry Regiment, 11th Missouri Infantry Regiment, 12th Missouri Infantry Regiment, Pindall's Missouri Sharpshooter Battalion, and Lesueur's Missouri Battery. At Jenkins' Ferry, Parsons arranged his division in a line with Burns' Brigade on the left and Clark's on the right. When Burns' Brigade advanced, it hit the 33rd Iowa Infantry Regiment and the 12th Kansas Regiment. After about half an hour of fighting, Burns' Brigade was able to work around the flank of the two Union regiments, driving them back. However, despite Burns' initial success, Union reinforcements arrived, driving the brigade back to where it had begun its attack. The 16th Missouri lost 30 men at Jenkins' Ferry, and Steele's force was able to escape across the Saline. After Jenkins' Ferry, the regiment was stationed at various points in Arkansas and at Shreveport, Louisiana. Lewis returned to the regiment in early 1865, and was appointed to serve as a brigadier general by General Edmund Kirby Smith on May 16. Cumming was then officially promoted from lieutenant colonel to colonel. On June 8, the men of the regiment were paroled; they would return to Missouri via steamboat. The 16th Missouri Infantry had more men die while serving in the regiment than any other Missouri unit fighting for the Confederacy: 83 men killed in action, 253 died of various diseases, two were executed for deserting, and three were executed by Union forces.

During World War II he sheltered dozens of Jews and political refugees and helped them evade capture by the Nazis. Biography Francesco Bertoglio was born on 15 February 1900 in Magenta, Italy. He studied at the Pontifical Lombard Seminary in Rome, where he joined his fellow student Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, on 16 November 1920, arriving late for the start of the term because he was completing his World War I service in the Italian army. He was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Milan on 31 March 1923. He continued his studies at the Seminary until 1924, earning a degree in theology. He then returned to Milan where he served as vice-rector of the gymnasium (secondary school) and taught at the seminary. He moved to Rome to lead his alma mater as Rector of the Pontifical Lombard Seminary, beginning on 16 July 1933; he held that post for more than 27 years. During the Nazi occupation of Rome, the Seminary sheltered more than a hundred Jews and several political refugees. On the night of 21–22 December 1943, the Nazi Koch Band invaded and searched the Seminary building. Bertoglio challenged them and was instrumental in holding them off long enough for most of the people they were after to escape. For his work that night and other assistance in providing shelter and forged documents he was later recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. On 1 September 1960, Pope John XXIII named him titular bishop of Paros. He received his episcopal consecration on 28 October 1960 from Pope John. He continued his work at the Seminary for several months, ending his tenure as Rector on 5 January 1961. He then led the Archconfraternity of SS. Ambrogio and Carlo, an association that had long supported the Seminary. He developed a plan for a seminary similar to the Lombard Seminary but having as its mission the education and spiritual formation of non-Italian clerics nominated by their bishops in an international community. In 1963 he won approval from the Congregation for Seminaries, now the Congregation for Catholic Education, for the proposed institution, to be named the International Ecclesiastical College of Saint Charles Borromeo. He was also postulator for the cause of Andrea Carlo Ferrari, which was opened 10 February 1963. In 1964, he became auxiliary bishop of Milan. Bertoglio died on 6 July 1977 at the age of 77.

The author of his own YouTube channel \\"SVTV\\".  Biography  Born in Moscow in 1985 in a family of medical students. As Michael himself says, he grew up in a family of classical liberals . In 2004, when he was 18 years old, he almost joined the National Bolshevik Party. From 2004 to 2006 he studied at the Faculty of History, Political Science and Law of the RSUH in the political science specialty. From there he transferred to the University of Nottingham with a degree in Political Science and graduated from the latter in 2009. According to his own statement, fluent in English, French and Japanese . In the UK, Svetov began blogging in LiveJournal. The first mention of libertarianism appeared in his LJ in 2005 - then Svetov was 20 years old. Although, as the politician claims, he has always been an \\"ardent libertarian.\\" Shortly before leaving for Japan, while in Moscow, Svetov joined the Libertarian Party. In 2010, Mikhail left for Japan. In Japan, Svetov taught the language and also sold Japanese souvenirs on the Internet. In 2011, as an eyewitness, he told the Russia-1 television channel about the Tokyo earthquake and the Fukushima accident. There he first invested in Bitcoin, which became the key to his material well- being. In 2016 he graduated from the New Zealand Film Academy. According to Svetov’s script, a short film “Jackpot” was released in New Zealand , which won first place in the state script competition and received sponsorship for a film adaptation. For some time, Mikhail worked in the film industry .  Political Views = Libertarianism  Svetov calls himself an ideological anarcho-capitalist. He believes that only through lustration and ensuring the functioning of the free market can corruption and the economic decline of Russia be overcome. In addition, Mikhail is a supporter of such ideas as: federalism, freedom of association, laissez-faire, legalization of weapons, drugs and abortion, reducing the role of the state in the life of a child (eliminating juvenile justice, the ability of private foundations to directly help children), etc.  Right conservatism  Michael identifies himself with the cultural right of the conservative . He stands for traditional relations, for the separation of gender roles in the family. According to Svetov, the family was unjustly scolded by the left, and the third-wave feminists did a disservice to women, making them more miserable. According to Mikhail, he would like to live in a homogeneous society somewhere in Kamchatka, having acquired a ranch and a large family.  Civic nationalism  Svetov would like Russia to cease to be the multinational state that Yeltsin made it, and become a national state according to the principle of Switzerland - “they speak four languages, live four different nations, practice different religions, but at the same time everyone lives in peace and harmony; they are Swiss, and we are Russia” . As a civic nationalist, Mikhail is a supporter of building a Russian civil nation and reviving the tradition of Russian identity .  Attitude to other political organizations  Michael criticizes the activities of parties and movements, which he calls pseudo- opposition, such as “Yabloko”, PARNAS, Left Front, Democratic Choice, Party of Growth . One of the main enemies of civil society, according to Svetov, is near-opposition and at the same time near-government, close to the ruling elites, politicians and journalists, such as Ksenia Sobchak, Dmitry Gudkov, Grigory Yavlinsky, Alexei Venediktov, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Sergey Udaltsov, Vladimir Ryzhkov, Boris Nemtsov, Sergey Parkhomenko and others. As of 2020, Mikhail sees only Alexey Navalny and the Anti-Corruption Fund as the only ally in the struggle against power in Russia, but he would be glad to see other sincere opposition forces, regardless of their political orientation .  Political activity  Speech by Mikhail Svetov at a rally against \\"isolation of the Russian Internet\\" In 2016, after returning to Russia from Japan, Svetov began his socio-political activities. He helped in the election campaign of Vera Kichanova and Andrei Shalnev. Helped with the organization of the eighth readings of Adam Smith. He organized the visit of Director of the Cato Institute Peter Goetler to read. He organized meetings and helped with the translation of the speeches of foreign guests . Mikhail Svetov was the organizer of opposition rallies: “For Free Internet” on August 26, 2017, a rally against the blocking of Telegram in Russia on April 30, 2018, a rally against pension reform on July 29, 2018. He initiated a public campaign against the \\"law of Klishas\\" on the “sovereign Internet” and launched a petition against the adoption of this law, which collected 122 thousand signatures. Mikhail also became one of the organizers of the rally in defense of the Internet in Moscow on March 10, 2019, and also spoke at it . Similar rallies also took place in Khabarovsk and Voronezh . After that, the Kremlin’s telegram channels began to spread an “investigation” about the fact that the real customer of the rally was the video blogger PewDiePie. Flag of Russian Libertarianism by Mikhail Svetov In May 2018, Mikhail presented the flag of Russian libertarianism - the Gadsden snake against the background of the Russian national tricolor of 1914. According to Svetov’s idea, this flag was to become a universal symbol for all libertarians of Russia, combining the political and philosophical convictions of the supporters of freedom with patriotism and Russian national culture. From time to time, Mikhail acts as the organizer of “Conservative Anime Parties”, where in an informal atmosphere visitors can watch anime, fry burgers, listen to music and chat, and discuss politics, libertarianism and listen to a lecture by an invited lecturer. On January 18, 2018, Svetov debated with Vladimir Milov on the topic of the presidential campaign of Aleksey Navalny and came out the winner according to the results of the ballot . In August, Michael met and talked with American Libertarian Senator Rand Paul. After the adviser to the Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky, Ruslan Stefanchuk, stated that the ideology of the \\"Servant of the People\\" party was libertarianism, Mikhail Svetov issued a text questioning the party’s commitment to libertarian values and, at the request of RTVI, made a small test for understanding libertarianism for Vladimir Zelensky himself . Mikhail Svetov acted as the inviting organizer of the lecture of one of the most prominent theoreticians of libertarianism in the world of Hans Hermann Hoppe. The lecture was held on October 6 in Moscow, where Hoppe described the destructive power of democracy, its incompatibility with individual freedom and the natural union between Western conservatism and libertarianism. Mikhail also spoke at the event .  Incidents  On April 30, 2018, he spoke at a rally in Moscow in support of the \\"Telegram\\" messenger, and called for lustrations. He believes that because of this appeal, some media outlets (\\"Medusa\\", \\"Rain\\" and Znak.com) did not cite his speech and also mention him as the organizer of the rally, as they were preparing for the next “change in the position of the nomenclature” . In July 2019, the Ukrainian Mirotvorets website introduced Mikhail Svetov to the list of people posing a threat to the national security of Ukraine in connection with his trip to the Crimea to his girlfriend On September 20, 2018 in St. Petersburg, Mikhail Svetov was subjected to a failed attempt at an armed attack. During the meeting, one of the members of the LPR regional branch who was present at her, after a short skirmish with Svetov, took out a knife and attempted an attack with him on Mikhail. Following the results of the proceedings on this incident, the LPR member who attempted the attack was expelled from the party for violating the Charter. Also, following the results of the proceedings on September 27, 2018, at an extraordinary meeting of the LPR Federal Committee, some representatives of the governing and audit bodies of the St. Petersburg regional branch were excluded, acquitting the aggressor, accusing Mikhail of provoking aggression and convicted of external control of the branch, systematic lying to party members and provoking a split inside branches.

It is regarded as the first fantasy role-playing PBM game. Publication history In the 1970s, play by mail had become a popular method in the U.K. for games like chess and Diplomacy. In 1980, Kevin Cropper took his long-running Dungeons & Dragons campaign, \\"Crasimoff's World\\", and redesigned it as a postal game; he envisioned moderating his creation by replying to each player's actions with a hand-written response. He then advertised Crasimoff's World in White Dwarf and subsequently received so many replies that he eventually left his job in order to spend all his time running the campaign. Cropper founded KJC Games as the parent company of the game. In her dissertation Playing with Power: The Authorial Consequence of Roleplaying Games, Michelle Nephew identifies Crasimoff's World as the first fantasy role-playing PBM game. By 1984, Cropper had 450 regular players, beyond his ability to moderate on his own. Wanting to concentrate on managing a games stores in Cleveleys, he hired two full-time gamemasters, Nigel Mitchell and Andy Smith. In addition to providing hand- written responses to players' turns, Mitchell and Smith also published a regular newsletter for players. For a time the game was popular enough that Cropper also hired a part-time staff member just to deal with new players' start-ups. From time to time, KJC Games also hosted \\"Crasimeets\\", conventions where players could meet face to face with gamemasters Mitchell and Smith for more traditional pencil-and-paper role-playing game sessions. KJC Games licensed the U.S. rights to Jack Everitt of Adventures by Mail, who developed an American version of the game. In 1987, KJC Games licensed Crasimoff's World to one of the gamemasters, Andy Smith, who created the company Crasiworld. A few years later, Crasiworld converted Crasimoff's World to a computer- moderated game, using the Quest PBM engine. Bolstered by several other PBM games, Crasiworld kept Crasimoff's World in operation until 2004. Gameplay In the original version of the game moderated by Kevin Cropper, players paid £2.50 for the rulebook, selected a cast of nine characters who were either priests, fighters or mages, and gave the group a name. Cropper would then place the new band of adventurers somewhere in his campaign world, and send the new player a letter that described their starting location, as well as campaign news, recent events in the new group's locality, and some rumours. The player would then respond with what they wanted their party to do, including which direction the party was travelling, trades or purchases, possible actions if encountered by hostiles, and any special instructions or requests. Cropper would then send further information and updates, and the player would respond with their next turn. Each turn cost £1.25. If one player's party wandered into an area already inhabited by another player's party, Cropper would give each player the other's contact information so the players could confer directly to share information. When Crasiworld changed moderation from human to computer, the number of starting party members was reduced from nine to six, but the new player could now choose from four professions as well as four races (humans, dwarves, elves and half-breeds) for each member of the party. Reception In the January 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #37), Trevor Graver was impressed, saying, \\"the effort the gamemaster puts into each turn never ceases to amaze me. Most players find themselves offered a different scenario each turn, or find that a new twist has happened to an existing adventure.\\" He concluded with a recommendation to give it a try, commenting, \\"It's easy to play, and reflects the amount of effort you are prepared to put into your moves.\\" In the September 1984 edition of Imagine (Issue 18), Brian Creese called Crasimoff's World \\"a highly worthy game\\", and mentioned the hand-written responses from moderators as an indicator of \\"the immense amount of effort put in by the GM.\\" He also thought that \\"with its regular newsletter, Crasimoff's World is a friendly, efficient and relatively cheap game to play.\\" Although Creese didn't find a PBM fantasy game as engaging as its face-to-face counterpart, he concluded, \\"If you wish to try a commercial pbm game with a distinctly D&D; game-ish flavour, I would unhesitatingly recommend it.\\" Awards At the 1985 Origins Awards, Crasimoff's World was a finalist for \\"Best Play-By-Mail Game of 1984\\", losing to Starweb.

History Its commissioner is unknown, since its first mention in the historical record dates to 1616, when it was given by a notable in Reggio Emilia to San Prospero Basilica in Reggio Emilia. Carracci had spent some time in that city during the 1580s and produced several works there, none still in their original locations, leading to the commonly-held theory that Lamentation was also produced in the city Alessandro Brogi, in Annibale Carracci, Catalogo della mostra Bologna e Roma 2006-2007 (edited by D.

His research in general is based on inorganic chemistry and magnetochemistry, specifically on coordination chemistry, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and f-block chemistry.  Education  Collison completed both his Bachelor of Science degree and Doctor of Philosophy degree at University of Manchester and successfully completed them in 1976 and 1980 respectively. His PhD thesis on Electronic structures of some d1 and d2 oxo- and nitrido- d transition metal complexes was supervised by David Garner and Ian Hillier.  Research and career  Upon completing his PhD, Collison joined the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (now University of Manchester) as a Research Associate from 1979 to 1982. He then was a Research Assistant from 1982 to 1983, Science and Engineering Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow from 1983 to 1984, and a Royal Society University Research Fellow from 1984 - 1994. By this time, he also joined the University of Manchester as a Senior Lecturer, and was promoted to the position of Reader in 1998 and to the position of Professor and Chair of Inorganic Chemistry in 2007. Collison's research in general is based on inorganic chemistry and magnetochemistry, specifically on coordination chemistry, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and f-block chemistry. Apart from research and lecturing, Collison is also the Co- Founder and Director of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council National Electron Paramagnetic Spectroscopy Facility. He was also the former Chair of the Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy Group of the Royal Society of Chemistry and is part of the Molecular Magnetism Group at University of Manchester along with Nicholas F. Chilton, Richard Winpenny, Eric McInnes, Grigore Timco and Floriana Tuna.  Notable work  Collison is regarded one of the leading researchers in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy . For his significant contributions to the experimental and theoretical fundamentals of transition metal electron paramagnetic resonance, from bioinorganic chemistry to molecular materials, and for his contribution to the book Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (Volume 19), he received the Bruker Prize in 2020, which is one of the world's highest awards in electron paramagnetic resonance. In 2016, Collison participated in a research which reported the use of an organic donor–acceptor polymer containing a viologen electron acceptor and triarylamine electron donor as a platform in the development of multifunctional materials. The research explored the interplay between electronic and host–guest interactions in the synthesized polymers; POP-V1 containing a redox active triarylamine core and POP-V2 containing a redox inactive benzene core, in which the redox states present can be reversibly accessed. The research showed that the degree of charge transfer in addition to the H2 and CO2 gas adsorption properties of the polymer are able to be tuned as a function of the electronic state which has important implications for the potential applications of these polymers in optical, electrochromic and solar cell devices. In 2015, Collison participated in a research which reported a dysprosium(III) bis(methanediide) single molecule magnet (SMM) with two large thermally activated energy barriers (Ueff) of 721 K and 813 K. This was the largest Ueff ever reported for a monometallic dysprosium(III) complex. The work was able to validate a design strategy towards realising high- temperature SMMs and also provide an insight to the unusual spin relaxation behaviour shown by the SMM.

It is at Calle Zapiola 1701 in the barrio of Belgrano in northern Buenos Aires, near its Chinatown. History Diplomatic relations between Argentina and the Philippines were established on August 21, 1948, with Narciso Ramos, who would later become Secretary of Foreign Affairs, being appointed as minister to Argentina by President Elpidio Quirino, alongside former member of the Philippine Legislature Manuel Escudero, who was appointed as first secretary and consul general. A legation was then opened on April 4, 1949, the first Philippine mission in Latin America, initially operating from the Plaza Hotel Buenos Aires. The mission was later upgraded to a full embassy in 1960, with former Representative Pedro Gil, who had been appointed by Quirino's successor, Ramon Magsaysay, as minister in 1956, becoming the first resident Philippine ambassador to Argentina. In 2018, members of the Argentine Workers' Central Union (CTA) organized a protest outside the Embassy against the policies of President Rodrigo Duterte. Chancery The property was used in various capacities prior to being occupied by the Embassy. On October 22, 1948, its owner, Francisco Toifl, sold the property — at the time a furnished house — to Raquel Burgos de Escobar. who also acquired the property on the opposite corner, and ran both properties as hotels. She then sold the property on November 6, 1950 to Josefa F. Mónaco de Miranda, who ran it as the Hotel Victory, and selling it less than a year later to a new owner, Teodoro Gehrung. By 1958, the property had come to the ownership of hoteliers Antonio Muras Núñez and Adolfo Mata Rial. Starting as late as 1967, and until at least 1973, the property served as the residence of Dr. Carlos David Storni, who became president and later Honorary Member of the Argentine Geological Association. In 1989, it was converted into the Hogar del Virrey, a retirement home established by psychologist Alejandro van Oostveldt and his wife, Elsa Patricia Pizzi, and in 2007 the property was listed as a heritage building (edificio representativo) by the Buenos Aires City Legislature with the passage of Law No. 2.548, which prohibits the demolition of any structure in Buenos Aires built before December 31, 1941. The Embassy began occupying the property in 2012, while the Buenos Aires center of the Sentro Rizal opened in the property on June 21, 2015. In 1997, the Buenos Aires city government was forced to reconstruct the property's legal records after it was discovered that the original records could not be found. Staff and activities The Philippine Embassy in Buenos Aires is currently headed by Ambassador Linglingay F. Lacanlale, who was appointed to the position by President Duterte on January 19, 2018. Prior to becoming Ambassador, Lacanlale, a decorated career diplomat with over 40 years of experience, had most recently served as Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Administration, and was also deployed to the missions in Vienna, New York City and Bangkok before that. Her appointment was confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on February 21, 2018. Many of the Embassy's activities center around promoting Filipino culture and strengthening the deep cultural ties between the Philippines and Argentina. These include promoting the practice of arnis in the country in 2007, facilitating a series of concerts by the University of the Philippines Madrigal Singers in 2011, organizing a benefit dinner for victims of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013, and hosting an exhibit on Philippine textiles at the Fondo Nacional de las Artes in 2019. It also collaborates with the other Southeast Asian missions in Argentina to promote the region as a whole: in 2015, the Embassy led in organizing a festival promoting Southeast Asian cultures at Plaza Barrancas in Belgrano, and the next year participated in festivities celebrating the 63rd anniversary of the Federación Económica de Tucumán. In addition to activities in Argentina, the Embassy exercises jurisdiction in Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, where it maintains honorary consulates. In 2012, the Embassy filed a diplomatic protest with the Argentinean Ministry of Foreign Affairs over a riot that took place after a match between Filipino boxer Johnriel Casimero and his Argentinean counterpart, Luis Alberto Lazarte, which led to calls in the Philippines for the recall of then-Ambassador Rey Carandang.

Background  In 2017, Banks released the song \\"Chi Chi\\" as the intended lead single from her upcoming album Business & Pleasure, however plans changed the following year when Banks shifted direction to focus on Fantasea II: The Second Wave which still awaits release. After separating from her previous record label eOne Music, Banks announced that her focus would return to Business & Pleasure as Fantasea II: The Second Wave was not \\"complete to her liking\\".

Discussing both Banks and Luger, Pearce added \\"The song likely isn’t enough to restore them to former glory, but it is quite the reminder of just how formidable they can be\\". Torsten Ingvaldsen of Hypebeast called the track an \\"ice-cold banger\\" adding that Banks \\"takes no time to unleash her lyrical braggadocio\\". Jon Powell of Revolt described Banks \\"delivering some of her grittiest, potent bars yet\\" on the song. Mitch Findlay of HotNewHipHop gave the track a \\"Very Hottttt\\" rating on the site as well as praising Banks and Luger stating that \\"The track finds her connecting with Lex Luger, who provides Banks with a lavish, ice-cold instrumental.

Contents Dicing with Dragons is an introduction to the then-new world of role-playing games. Livingstone explains how role-playing games work, and includes a solo adventure, \\"Eye of the Dragon\\", as an example. Livingstone then details the major role-playing systems that dominated the market in 1982: * Dungeons & Dragons * RuneQuest * Traveller * Tunnels & Trolls He also briefly describes 31 other role-playing games, including Boot Hill, Bushido, Call of Cthulhu, Gamma World, Gangbusters, and Top Secret. There are also chapters on: * Accessories, including summaries of adventures for the role- playing games previously mentioned, and magazines and fanzines specializing in role-playing games * How to paint miniature figures * How to be a gamemaster * Computer systems and computer games that were available in 1982 * Descriptions of several live action games that would later evolve into Live action role- playing games (LARPs) Publication history Geraldine Cooke, an editor at Puffin Books, was looking to revive the firm's moribund science fiction, fantasy and horror collection. A friend told her about a new store in Hammersmith called Games Workshop that specialized in role-playing games. After meeting with the owners, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, she asked them to write a book exploring the role-playing industry. The book they gave her instead was an actual role-playing adventure called Warlock of Firetop Mountain, eventually published under the Puffin Books imprint, the first of many very popular Fighting Fantasy books. Ian Livingstone did write the originally requested book about role-playing, Dicing with Dragons, but it was published in the U.K. by Routledge & Kegan Paul in 1982, not Penguin. The illustrations, almost all of them square, were created by Russ Nicholson. The artist later explained that Jackson and Livingstone had requested the square format for Warlock of Firetop Mountain, and Livingstone wanted the same format used in this book. In 1983, Dicing with Dragons was published in the United States by Plume, an imprint of New American Library. In 1986, an Italian translation, Giocare a dadi col drago, was published by Milanese publisher Longanesi; the Italian edition included a new preface written by Giampaolo Dossena. Reception In the February 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #38), M L Rowland was impressed by Dicing with Dragons, calling it \\"probably the most complete summary of the role-playing hobby available, and well worth buying for its appendices alone.\\" Rowland concluded with a strong recommendation, giving the book an excellent rating of 9 out of 10. In the April 1983 edition of Imagine (Issue 1), Dave Pringle commented that \\"In addition to covering all the familiar RPG ground, this book contains a useful chapter on computer games. Recommended.\\" In a 2014 retrospective review, Pornokitsch stated that \\"Livingstone's Dicing with Dragons is interesting because it is so dated - a peek at the formative years of role playing games.\\"https://www.pornokitsch.com/2014/09/review-dicing-with-dragons-shared- fantasy.html Reviews *Fantasy Review, October 1984http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?283715 References Category:Books about role-playing games ","title":"Dicing with Dragons"},{"id":"64284359","text":"The 2020 Uzbekistan Cup is the 28th season of the annual Uzbekistan Cup, the knockout football cup competition of Uzbekistan.

Odoardo then saw the work hanging on a wall of the Palazzo Farnese, mistook it for a work by Luciani and stated that it confirmed his previous assertion, to which Annibale immediately replied that the work's artist was by \\"the grace of God, [still] alive\\". Like the rest of the Farnese collection, the work moved from Rome to Parma and finally to Naples.

The work was originally sited in the Macchiavelli chapel in San Nicolò di San Felice, Bologna, next to Santa Maria della Carità, which was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. It was then temporarily moved to the Soprintendenza di Bologna and finally to its current home. Dating In Felsina Pittrice in 1678, Carlo Cesare Malvasia stated that Carracci produced the work when he was eighteen (defining it as \\"the first work ever to come from the great Annibale's brush\\") and that the commission was initially offered to Ludovico Carracci, who decided the offered payment was too little and so passed it onto his young cousin Annibale. However, this account is unreliable, since cleaning in the 1920s revealed a date of 1583 on the canvas, at which point Annibale was twenty-three. Daniele Benati, in Daniele Benati and Eugenio Riccomini (edited by), Annibale Carracci, Catalog of the exhibition Bologna and Rome 2006-2007 , Milan, 2006, p. 136. That still makes it his earliest surviving work and his first surviving work for a public audience, though it throws doubt on Malvasia's dating, since a church commission is unlikely to have been his first work, instead indicating that Carracci was already a successful artistD. Benati, Annibale Carracci, Catalogo, cit., p. 136. Malvasia also states that older and more established artists in Bologna criticised the work for excessive realism (calling its figure of Christ a \\"naked porter\\"), the composition's disharmony, the inaccurate and fast brushwork and the lack of decorum seen, for example, in Francis' calloused feet. Modern art historians instead see these features as Annibale (albeit with a youthful uncertainty) attempted to break away from the late-Mannerist style then dominant in Bologna and establish a new artistic language founded in realism.

Its origin lay in Artillery Volunteer Corps formed in the Surrey suburbs of South London in the 1860s, which had later been incorporated into a larger London unit. Together with its wartime duplicate it served on the Western Front, at Salonika and in Palestine during World War I. Converted to the anti-tank role just before World War II it saw widely varied service during the war, while its duplicate regiment landed on D-Day. The regiment continued in the postwar Territorial Army until 1961. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163–8. Two such units were formed in South London, the 1st Surrey Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC) on 12 October 1860 at 12 Union Place, Lambeth Road, and the 2nd Surrey AVC on 10 November 1860 at Brixton. At that time, Lambeth, Brixton and the surrounding area was part of Surrey but was later incorporated into the County of London. The 1st Surrey AVC began as a 'sub-division', was expanded to a battery on 15 December 1860, and additional batteries were formed on 4 May and 19 November 1861. However, recruiting dipped after the first enthusiasm wore off, and the unit was struck off on 27 May 1864. The 2nd Surrey AVC took the title of 1st Surrey AVC in 1866 and recruited widely: by 1877 it had reached a strength of 10 batteries recruited from Brixton, Loughborough Junction, Camberwell, and even Shepherd's Bush in Middlesex. By then its headquarters (HQ) was at Loughborough Road, Brixton, moving to Camberwell in 1881. In March 1883 the unit amalgamated with the 1st London (City) AVC based in the City of London, to which the 1st Surrey AVC provided Nos 7–16 Batteries.Barnes, Appendix III.Beckett, Appendix VIII.Frederick, pp. 669–70.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 158.Army List, various dates.London Gazette, 27 May 1864.Maude, Appendix F.1st London Artillery at Regiments.org Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) on 1 May 1908 under the Haldane Reforms,Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st City of London Artillery split to form three brigades in the Royal Field Artillery: I City of London Brigade in the City, VI County of London Brigade at Brixton, and VII County of London Brigade at Shepherd's Bush. The VI (or 6th) London Brigade was formed on 1 May 1908 from Nos 11–16 Companies of the 1st City Artillery, with the following organisation:London Gazette 20 March 1908.6th London Artillery at Regiments.org.Barnes, Appendix IV.Frederick, p. 678.Litchfield, pp. 156–7.Maude, pp. 1–2; Appendix C.

The Brigade was assigned to the 2nd London Division of the TF. The three batteries were each equipped with four 15-pounder guns.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 69–75.47th (2nd London) Division at Long, Long Trail. World War I=Mobilisation When war broke out in August 1914, VI London Bde had already completed its annual training camp for the year, and the brigade was mobilised at Brixton under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel R.J. MacHugh, who had been Commanding Officer (CO) since 1912. After mobilisation the 2nd London Division's artillery brigades moved to the country round Hemel Hempstead, Berkhamsted and Kings Langley in Hertfordshire to begin war training.Maude, pp. 2–3, 11. On the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the WO issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Eventually these too were prepared for overseas service and 3rd Line reserve units were formed to produce reinforcement drafts to the others.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. The duplicate 2/VI London Brigade was formed in September 1914 and separated in March 1915 when 1/VI Brigade went overseas.Dalbaic, pp. 17–8.Frederick, pp. 690–1. 1/VI London Brigade At the end of October 1914 the 2nd London Division was chosen to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fighting on the Western Front and training was stepped up, despite bad weather and equipment shortages. Brigade and Divisional training began in February 1915 and it received its orders for the move to France on 2 March. By 22 March all the batteries had reached the divisional concentration area around Béthune.Farndale, Western Front, p. 94.Maude, pp. 3, 11–12. =Aubers Ridge= While the division's infantry were introduced to trench routine by being attached in groups to the 1st and 2nd Divisions holding the line, the TF field batteries with their obsolescent 15-pounders were interspersed with those of the two Regular divisions equipped with modern 18-pounder guns. However, ammunition was very scarce, and the guns were restricted to three rounds per gun per day during April. Ammunition was being saved up for the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May, when the 15-pounders of 1/VI London Bde joined with the guns of 1st and 2nd Divisions and the Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) to cut the barbed wire for the assault by 1st Division. The bombardment began at 05.00 with Shrapnel shell, then at 05.30 the guns switched to High Explosive (HE) shell to join the howitzers already firing at the German breastworks. At 05.40 the guns lifted to targets further back and the infantry moved to the attack. The attackers ran into devastating machine gun fire (there was no artillery barrage to suppress the defenders) and they found that the wire was inadequately cut and the breastworks barely touched. The inexperienced artillery had failed in all its tasks. A renewed bombardment was ordered from 06.15 to 07.00, but the artillery's forward observation officers (FOOs) were unable to locate the hidden German machine gun positions, which required a direct hit from an HE shell to be put out of action. The second attack failed as badly as the first, as did two others launched during the afternoon, and the survivors were pinned down in No man's land until nightfall, despite a further bombardment being laid on to allow them to withdraw.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 6, 17–29, 39.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 103–7.Maude, pp 12–3. =Festubert= Although 2nd London Division suffered few casualties at Aubers Ridge, its gunners had learned a sobering lesson about the impossibility of suppressing strong defences with inadequate guns and shells. On 11 May the division was redesignated 47th (1/2nd London) Division, and on the night of 14/15 May it took its place in the line for the Battle of Festubert. The guns were already in place, with 47th Divisional Artillery operating under the control of 7th Division. Despite the continuing shortage of ammunition, the plan this time was for a long methodical bombardment. On 13 and 14 May the field guns carried out three two-hour deliberate bombardments each day, attacking the wire with slow observed fire or keeping the enemy communication trenches under fire. At night they carried out intermittent bombardments of the communication trenches and defences, to stop supplies being brought up and to prevent repairs being carried out. The guns fired about 100 rounds per day. During 15 May feint bombardments mimicking the moment of assault were carried out, but the actual attack was made after dark with some success. The fighting went on for several days, and 47th (2nd L) Division made its own first attack on the night of 25 May. The leading brigade captured the German front and support trenches, but were then pinned down by accurate German artillery fire and could advance no further. This effectively ended the battle. The heavy rate of fire during the battle was too much for the old 15-pdrs: by 26 May, 11 out of 36 guns in the division were out of action.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 44–76.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 107–10.Maude, pp. 14–20. =Loos= In June 47th (2nd L) Division took over trenches in front of Loos-en-Gohelle from the French. This was the sector selected for the next major British attack (the Battle of Loos), to which part of 47th (2nd L) Division would provide the southern 'hinge'. 1/VI London Bde with its obsolescent guns was not assigned a major role in the complex artillery plan, and 10 of its guns remained in reserve at Haillicourt, behind the attack of 141st (5th London) Brigade. Supported by poison gas clouds, the attacking portion of 47th (2nd L) Division made good progress. However, events had not played out so well further north, at Hill 70 and the Hohenzollern Redoubt, and the battle raged on after 47th (2nd L) Division had been relieved between 28 September and 1 October.Cherry, pp. 41, 109–12.Edmonds, 1915, Vol II, pp. 174–76, 182–91.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 116–23.Maude, pp. 25–36. 18-pounder preserved at the Imperial War Museum. On 13 October 47th (2nd L) Division was in support for the final attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt, and was practising on dummy trenches for a follow-up attack on Hulluch next day, but the results at the Hohenzollern were so disappointing that the operation was cancelled. The division took over the line and the artillery was in constant action over the following weeks. On 6 November 1915 the batteries of 1/VI London Bde were re-equipped with modern 18-pounders. Ammunition supply also improved, and the guns could be used for counter-battery (CB) work.Maude, pp. 37–41, 46–7. =Spring 1916= On 17 May 1916 1/VI London Bde was renumbered CCXXXVI Bde (236 Bde) and the batteries were designated A, B and C. At the same time it was joined by 1/22nd London Bty from 1/VIII London (Howitzer) Brigade (now CCXXXVIII Bde), which became D (H) Bty; it was equipped with four 4.5-inch howitzers. At this time the brigade ammunition columns (BACs) were abolished and incorporated into the divisional ammunition column (DAC). 4.5-inch howitzer at the Royal Artillery Museum. In the Spring of 1916 47th (2nd L) Division took over the lines facing Vimy Ridge. Active mine warfare was being conducted by both sides underground. In May the Germans secretly assembled 80 batteries in the sector and on 21 May carried out a heavy bombardment in the morning; the bombardment resumed at 15.00 and an assault was launched at 15.45, while the guns lifted onto the British guns and fired a Box barrage into Zouave Valley to seal the attacked sector off from support. 47th Divisional Artillery reported 150 heavy shells an hour landing on its poorly-covered battery positions and guns being put out of action, while its own guns tried to respond to SOS calls from the infantry under attack, though most communications were cut by the box barrage. During the night the gun pits were shelled with gas, but on 22 May the artillery duel began to swing towards the British, with fresh batteries brought in, despite their shortage of ammunition. A system of 'one round strikes' was introduced: whenever a German battery was identified every gun in range fired one round at it, which effectively suppressed them. British counter-attacks were attempted, but when the fighting died down the Germans had succeeded in capturing the British front line.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 210–27.Farndale Western Front, p. 138.Maude, pp. 50–7. =Somme= The two wooden memorial crosses originally erected at High Wood and Eaucourt L'Abbaye by 47th (2nd London) Division in 1916, now at Connaught House in Camberwell. On 1 August 1916 47th (2nd L) Division began to move south to join in the Somme Offensive. While the infantry underwent training with the newly introduced tanks, the divisional artillery went into the line on 14 August in support of 15th (Scottish) Division. The batteries were positioned in Bottom Wood and near Mametz Wood, and became familiar with the ground over which 47th (2nd L) Division was to attack, while supporting 15th (S) Division's gradual encroachment on Martinpuich. Casualties among FOOs and signallers was heavy in this kind of fighting. Between 9 and 11 September 47th (2nd L) Division took over the front in the High Wood sector, and on 15 September the Battle of Flers-Courcelette was launched, with tank support for the first time. The barrage fired by the divisional artillery left lanes through which the tanks could advance. However, the tanks proved useless in the tangled tree stumps of High Wood, and the artillery could not bombard the German front line because No man's land was so narrow. Casualties among the attacking infantry were extremely heavy, but they succeeded in capturing High Wood and the gun batteries began to move up in support, crossing deeply-cratered ground. Here casualties among the exposed guns and gunners took their toll, but a German counter-attack was broken up by gunfire. Next day the division fought to consolidate its positions round the captured 'Cough Drop' strongpoint. When the infantry were relieved on 19 September the artillery remained in the line under 1st Division.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 150–2.Maude, pp. 61–9.Miles, 1916, pp. 299, 331–3, 344, 352. Bringing up ammunition fo an 18-pounder battery during the Battle of the Somme 47th (2nd L) Division came back into the line to relieve 1st Division on 28/29 September, and began attacking Eaucourt L'Abbaye as part of the Battle of the Transloy Ridges, finally securing the ruins on 3 October. This allowed the batteries to cross the High Wood Ridge into a small valley where they remained for the rest of the Somme fighting, helping to cover the unsuccessful attacks by 47th (2nd L) Division and later 9th (Scottish) Division against the Butte de Warlencourt through October. By now the gun lines were crowded together in deep mud, guns sank up to their axles, and getting ammunition through was extremely difficult. The artillery was finally relieved on 14 October and followed the rest of the division to the Ypres Salient.Farndale, Western Front, p. 154.Maude, pp. 69–78.Miles, 1916, pp. 430–43. A further reorganisation of field artillery in the BEF was carried out in November 1916. In CCXXXVI Bde this meant that C Bty was broken up between A and B to bring them up to six guns each, and the brigade was joined by 523 (H) Bty, which had recently joined 47th Divisional Artillery from England and became C (H) Bty. Another reorganisation came on 19 January 1917, when C (H) Bty (523 (H) Bty) left to bring batteries in army field brigades up to six howitzers and was replaced by C/CCXXXVIII Bty (originally part of 1/VIII London Bde), while a section of D (H)/CCXXXV Bty (originally B (H) Bty from CLXXVI (Leicestershire) (H) Bde in 34th Division of New Army) joined D (H) Bty to bring it up to six howitzers. This gave the brigade its final organisation for the rest of the war:Frederick, p. 549. * A Bty – 1/15th London Bty + half 1/17th London Bty * B Bty – 1/16th London Bty + half 1/17th London Bty * C Bty – 1/19th London Bty + half 1/18th London Bty * D (H) Bty – 1/22nd London (H) Bty + half D (H)/CLXXVI (Leicestershire) Bty =Messines= At Ypres 47th (2nd L) Division garrisoned the Hill 60 sector, where mine warfare had being conducted for two years, and where the British had dug a massive deep mine beneath the hill ready for the planned Battle of Messines. The divisional artillery was arranged in two groups, one in Ypres, the other in the Railway Dugouts. These battery positions were under enemy observation and were frequently shelled during the winter. On 16 January 1917 a German attack was anticipated, and the divisional artillery, together with that of 23rd and 41st Divisions and the Corps and Army heavy guns, carried out an intense bombardment, which brought considerable enemy retaliation. As well as organised bombardments of the enemy lines, the guns frequently responded to SOS calls from the front during enemy raids, and laid on wire-cutting and box barrages for British trench raids.Maude, pp. 80–95. Several weeks before the Battle of Messines (7 June) the artillery had begun destructive shoots on various points in the enemy lines and communications, and began wire-cutting in May. The enemy response was fierce and casualties in men and guns were frequent. 47th (2nd L) Division's role in the attack was to advance on either side of the Ypres–Comines Canal, which was practised over taped-out courses behind the lines. On 31 May bombardment of the enemy trenches became intense, and on 3 and 5 June the barrages were practised, forcing the Germans to retaliate and give away their gun positions. At 03.30 on 7 June a series of massive mines were fired under the enemy lines from Hill 60 all along the Messines–Wytschaete Ridge, and the infantry began their advance. About two- thirds of the 18-pdrs fired a creeping barrage ahead of the infantry, while the remainder and the 4.5inch howitzers fired standing barrages ahead. The German defences were shattered by the mines and the bombardment, and the infantry cleared their first objectives with little difficulty. A standing barrage then protected them while they prepared for the second phase. On 47th (2nd L) Division's front there was a hold-up at Spoil Bank by the canal in the second phase, but a new barrage was laid on this point and a renewed attack made at 19.00; although this too was held up, the position was later secured by the division. The field batteries were moved up to cover the new forward positions and to break up counter-attacks. During the battle some 18-pdr batteries fired as many as 6000 rounds in 24 hours.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 41–9, 60, 69, 82.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 184–91.Maude, pp. 95–103. =Ypres= After Messines the division was withdrawn for training, and following a short spell back in the line at Hill 60 it was in reserve for the opening of the Third Ypres Offensive on 31 July. It held an active portion of the front under enemy observation from 18 August to 3 September, and advanced and improved the line, but the artillery found it difficult to inflict much damage on the enemy, which had adopted defence in depth with most of the troops hidden in dead ground. Between 8 and 17 September the division was in the line again, making preparations for I ANZAC Corps' attack due on 20 September and keeping up pressure by means of frequent raids. One of these raids, on 15 September, employed a hurricane bombardment to rush a troublesome enemy strongpoint near Inverness Copse. 47th (2nd L) Division was then moved south on 21 September to join First Army leaving the artillery in the line for a while longer.Maude, pp. 104–10. The division was stationed in a quiet sector in front of Oppy and Gavrelle. The British defences were not a continuous trench line, but a series of platoon or company strongpoints, the area between each to be covered by the artillery and machine guns. Once the divisional artillery joined from Ypres, close liaison with the infantry positions was achieved, and enemy positions were regularly bombarded. Wire-cutting for raids was also carried out, and smoke and incendiary ammunition was now available.Maude, pp. 112–7. =Cambrai= Drivers of 47th Divisional Artillery water their horses at Flesquières 24 November 1917 during the Battle of Cambrai. On 19 November the division began a long march southwards, arriving on the night of 28/29 November to relieve the units holding Bourlon Wood, where fighting had been continuous since the launch of the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November. A major German counter-attack began the following morning. The infantry of 47th (2nd L) Division were covered by the artillery of the divisions they were relieving, while CCXXXVI Brigade under the command of Lt-Col A.H. Bowring was away calibrating its guns at ranges on the old Somme battlefield. Late in the afternoon it received orders to move up and support 20th (Light) Division, which was holding onto Welsh Ridge and La Vacquerie under heavy attack. The brigade moved off at 04.30 on 1 December and came into action on the forward slopes above Villers-Plouich, looking across at La Vacquerie only away. During the next few days the enemy tried hard to get into La Vacquerie but the FOOs were able to bring down their batteries' fire to break up these attacks. The battery positions were at the edge of the enemy barrage, and some casualties were suffered among the guns in the open on the forward slope. Any spare time the gunners had between shoots was spent in removing stores from Villers-Plouich in preparation for a withdrawal. By 5 December the battery positions were becoming precarious, and A and D Btys were withdrawn to the Beaucamp Valley and brigade HQ moved back to a chalkpit east of Havrincourt Wood. The waggon lines had been behind Gouzeaucourt Wood, but were shelled out on 6 December. By 8 December B and C Btys were also withdrawn alongside brigade HQ, where the new line had stabilised.Farndale, Western Front, p. 257.Maude, pp. 119–27, 137–41. =Spring Offensive= While the infantry of 47th (2nd L) Division were withdrawn from the Flesquières salient to relatively comfortable winter quarters, the artillery remained in the line until 7 March 1918, when it was relieved and rejoined the division. The infantry took over the La Vacquerie sector from 2nd Division on the nights of 19/20 and 20/21 March. The anticipated German Spring Offensive (Operation Michael) began at 04.15 on 21 March (the Battle of St Quentin), before the artillery had arrived, and the division was supported by 2nd Division's artillery in the subsequent fighting. 47th Divisional Artillery was separated from its parent formation for the next two months.Maude, pp. 143, 147, 149–50. CCXXXVI Brigade had been out of the line training in mobile warfare. By midday on 21 March it was on the road with orders to report to 19th (Western) Division, but on the way it was diverted to join 17th (Northern) Division, which assigned it positions near Vélu Wood. By 17.00 it was shelling German positions in Doignies and at 18.00 it fired an hour-long barrage to support 17th Division's counter-attack on Doignies, despite coming under hostile CB fire. Towards midnight the batteries were moved back, picked up the transport and marched through Bapaume to support 6th Division, which was hard-pressed on the north side of the Cambrai road. A and B Batteries were sent north to positions east of Sapignies, while C and D Btys and brigade HQ took up positions at dawn east of Frémicourt. These batteries had to fire immediate barrages against the advancing German troops. The Germans pressed on throughout 22 March, and during the night C and D Btys were moved back west of Frémicourt. The brigade now came under the orders of 41st Division as the Germans pushed the British infantry back. On 24 March the guns came under heavy shellfire and had to withdraw to positions nearer Bapaume, and then went back further during the night to the shelter of the railway embankment near Achiet-le-Petit. Dawn revealed the British infantry streaming back, followed by the enemy, and the brigade as ordered back again: the gun teams galloped up from Achiet-le-Petit and the guns were pulled out, covered by fire from two tanks and a battery of CCXXXV Bde. After a massive traffic jam in Achiet-le- Petit was cleared, the brigade deployed around Bucquoy. But the line had been outflanked and the gun teams were shelled out of their positions, so the brigade was ordered back once more. By dawn on 26 March they were coming into action near Gommecourt, with the gun teams close by in case another retirement. But 4th Australian Brigade came up and filled the gap, and the line held firm, supported. by frequent barrage fire from the guns: a determined German attack at 17.00 failed. The line here held firm during the last days of March and the gun teams could be rested for the first time since 21 March. The line was supported by an ad hoc artillery ground commanded by Lt-Col Bowring, consisting of his own brigade together with two others from 41st Division. Enemy retaliation caused brigade HQ and D Bty to be moved to safer positions, bu there was no further retreat in this sector. On 5 April both of 47th (2nd L) Division's RFA brigades came under the command of 37th Division, supporting a counter-attack that disrupted the last phase of Operation Michael, the Battle of the Ancre, on this front. CCXXXVI Brigade remained in the line until it was finally relieved to a rest area near Abbeville on 9 May.Farndale, Western Front, p. 271.Maude, pp. 173, 178–81. =Hundred Days= 47th (2nd London) Division was rejoined by its artillery at the end of May and went into corps reserve in late June. On 28 June the artillery moved up to support an attack launched by the Australian Corps (the Battle of Hamel). The dawn attack was made with overwhelming artillery support, notable because to preserve secrecy the guns had not been able to register their barrage lines beforehand. CCXXXVI Brigade was able to turn a captured field gun onto the enemy.Farndale, Western Front, p. 284.Maude, p. 186. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August 1918, and the artillery of 47th (2nd L) Division were once again detached, supporting 18th (Eastern) Division from 13 August to 4 September. CCXXXVI brigade found itself in the same dugouts in Caterpillar Valley that they had occupied in 1916. On 22 August 18th (E) Division formed a defensive flank while 47th (2nd L) Division attacked from in front of Amiens towards high ground beyond Happy Valley (the Battle of Albert). The night before the attack D (H)/CCXXXVI Bty had their commander and 35 men put out of action by enemy Mustard gas shelling. From now on the battle was constantly moving, and the British divisions began sending forward all-arms brigade groups including artillery batteries to clear strongholds and round up prisoners as they advanced. The field artillery frequently had to organise creeping barrages for these small operations, and casualties from enemy shellfire and gas were continuous.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 196–7, 201–2, 233, 284–5, 291–2, 321–2, 343.Maude, pp. 190, 195–6. Artillery of 47th (2nd London) Division in the Grande Place during the official entry into Lille, 28 October 1918/ Both 18th (E) and 47th (2nd L) Divisions, their infantry now very weak, were relieved in early September. 47th Divisional Artillery then moved by train (only the second time they had done this) to rejoin the rest of the division, which had been moved to the Lille front. The division was scheduled to be transferred to the Italian Front, but the orders wee changed and the division was put into the line to follow the retreating enemy across Aubers Ridge as far as the main Lille defences. After a 10-day pause, the division was relieved and once again prepared for the move to Italy. However, on 28 October this was finally changed, and 47th (2nd L) Division made the Official Entry into the liberated city of Lille on 28 October. It afterwards moved up to the River Scheldt, occupying Tournai when the enemy retired. It advanced beyond, but when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November, 47th Division marched back to Tournai.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, p. 448.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, pp. 413, 538–45.Maude, pp. 194, 199–206. Immediately after the Armistice 47th (2nd L) Division was engaged in railway repairs. It went into winter quarters mining villages in the Béthune area to await demobilisation, which began in January 1919. By the end of March units had been reduced to cadre strength, and these returned to England in May. The artillery brigades were demobilised at Shoreham-by-Sea in June 1919.Maude, pp. 207–11. =Commanding officers= The following commanded 1/VI London/CCXXXVI Brigade during World War I:Maude, Appendix D. * Lt-Col R.J. MacHugh, TD, from mobilisation to April 1915 * Lt-Col A.C. Lowe, DSO, (previously commanded 47th Divisional Ammunition Column) May 1915 to September 1917 * Lt-Col A.H. Bowring, September 1917 to November 1918 * Lt-Col the Hon H.G.O. Bridgeman, DSO, (previously Brigade major, RA, 47th Division) November 1918 to demobilisation 2/VI London Brigade The 2/2nd London Division came into existence quickly as volunteers rushed to join up. There were no guns or horses for the artillery, but the batteries improvised dummy guns mounted on hardcarts, with wooden sights and washing-lines for drag-ropes. Although the Master-General of the Ordnance, Major-General Sir Stanley von Donop, was pleased with their work and promised them the first guns available, it was not until February 1915 that some old 15-pdrs arrived for training. In March 1915 the division took the place of 1/2nd London Division in the St Albans area. At the end of May, now numbered 60th (2/2nd London) Division, it moved into Essex, with the artillery at Much Hadham. Finally, at the end of November it began to receive new 18-pdr guns and towards the end of January 1916 the division moved to the Warminster training area on Salisbury Plain.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 25–32.60th (2/2nd London) Division at Long, Long Trail.Dalbiac, pp. 18–9, 30–1, 35. On 28 April 3/2 Wessex Bty arrived as a fourth 18-pdr battery for 2/VI London Brigade. Then, as with the TF artillery brigades in the BEF, those in 60th Division were numbered on 17 May, 2/VI Londons taking the number CCCI Brigade (301 Bde), and the batteries were lettered. 3/2 Wessex Bty was transferred to 2/VIII London (CCCIII) Brigade. The BACs were also absorbed into the DAC.Frederick, p. 695. =Western Front= 60th (2/2nd London) Division's formation sign On 14 June 1916 orders arrived for 60th Division to move to the Western Front, and the artillery units made the crossing from Southampton to Le Havre between 22 and 26 June, with CCCI Bde under the command of Lt-Col Thatcher. The division concentrated in the area behind Arras by 29 June. It relieved 51st (Highland) Division in the line on 14 July, with the artillery moving into position over the next three nights. The line held was facing the same strong German positions along Vimy Ridge that 47th (2nd L) Division had faced, and there was constant mine warfare and trench raiding. The artillery was mostly engaged in suppressing troublesome German trench mortars (Minenwerfers) by firing short concentrated bombardments on specific sectors of the enemy line. Some trench raids were preceded by local wirecutting bombardments, or by a barrage, others were 'stealth' raids.Dalbiac, pp. 42–62; Appendix I. On 30 August the divisional artillery underwent the same reorganisation into six-gun batteries that was going on throughout the BEF. In CCCI Bde this meant that A Bty was broken up to bring B and C up to six guns each, while D (H) Bty (originally 2/21 London Bty) joined from CCC Bde. On 20 October the newly raised 519 (H) Bty arrived from England and became A (H) Bty. However, orders arrived on 1 November for the division to transfer to the Macedonian front (Salonika), where the four-gun different establishment was still in force. On 5 November A (H) Bty left for CCC Bde, and the original A Bty was reformed from its sections in B and C Btys. The BAC was also reformed. Once the brigade was in Macedonia, the six-gun battery establishment was introduced there as well, and A Bty was once again (and finally) split between B and C Btys, which were redesignated A and B. (It was not until 17 June 1917 that D (H) Bty was redesignated C (H)):Dalbiac, pp. 63–5. * A Bty – 2/16th London Bty + half 2/15th London Bty * B Bty – 2/17th London Bty + half 2/15th London Bty * C (H) Bty – 2/21st London (H) Bty =Salonika= Entrainment of the artillery for the embarkation port of Marseilles began on 14 November and was a slow business due to lack of facilities: the drivers needed their wooden trench bridges to get their horses aboard the trains. All units were embarked and at sea by 12 December and proceeded to Salonika via Malta. Early in 1917 the division's units moved up the poor roads to the Lake Doiran sector and settled in to improve the defences and harass the enemy. Veterinary officers found that the transport horses and mules in this campaign were overworked, but that artillery horses lacked exercise and it became standard practice to allow them to wander at will during the day and then round them up a feeding times. In early March the division began moving in bad weather to take over the line between Lake Doiran and the Vardar in preparation for the Allied Spring offensive. Apart from diversionary raids, 60th (2/2nd L) Division took little part in the first part of this operation (8–9 April), most of its batteries being used to reinforce the main attack near Lake Doiran, which required several days' artillery preparation. The division did attack during the second phase of the offensive (8/9 May), but it captured its objectives by night attacks without preliminary artillery fire. A further advance was made by the division on 15 May, but the rest of the offensive having come to a standstill it was called off on 24 May. On 1 June 1917 the division was marched back to Salonika to embark for Egypt.Dalbiac, pp. 65–7, 78–104.Wakefield & Moody, pp. 69, 85, 95, 154. =Palestine= Immediately after landing at Alexandria 60th (2/2nd L) Division moved to the Suez Canal to join the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), where its units were reorganised. On 17 June, B Bty left to join a new CCLXVIII Bde being formed at El Ferdan for 74th (Yeomanry) Division.The BAC was also absorbed into the DAC once more.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 117–22. The Division then underwent training before crossing Sinai in early July 1917. Further intensive training followed until late October, when the division made its first full-scale attack of the war, at Beersheba. In the weeks leading up to the attack artillery officers had regularly ridden close to the Beersheba defences to reconnoitre, often under fire. Concentration for the attack was carried out under cover of darkness, beginning on 20/21 October and completed on 28/29 October. The divisional artillery was divided into Right and Left groups corresponding to the two attacking brigade; CCCI Bde was part of Left Group under Lt-Cil Thatcher supporting 181st (2/6th London) Brigade. The whole force moved forward with great secrecy over featureless desert under moonlight on 30/31 October, the Royal Engineers improving the track north of Wadi ed Sabe for the artillery, which was in position by 01.30. All guns had 200 rounds available. At dawn the guns began to bombard Hill 1070, pausing at 07.00 to let the smoke and dust clear. At 08.30 the guns switched from wire- cutting to intensive bombardment, 181st Bde moving forward as the guns lifted, and taking the hill in 10 minutes. As soon as new Observation Posts (OPs) had been established on the hill the batteries galloped forward over the stony ground to begin wire-cutting on the main Turkish position. The general advance was resumed at 12.15 and 181st Brigade captured its objectives easily, 'thanks largely to the excellent work of the 301st Artillery group', according to the divisional history. By 13.00 the whole of the defence works were in British hands, and that evening the Desert Mounted Corps entered Beersheba.Dalbiac, pp. 106–8, 112–22.Falls, Vol II, Pt I, pp. 46–51.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 98. The next phase of the offensive involved 60th (2/2nd L) Division in an attack on Kauwukah in the Turkish Sheria position (the Battle of Hareira and Sheria) on 6 November. The attacking brigades moved forwards at 03.30 with the artillery, which began wire-cutting as soon as it was in position. Each 18-pdr battery cut two gaps in the wire by 12.15, and then began a bombardment of the enemy trench as the attack went in against heavy fire. The field guns then lifted onto the works in the second line. The whole defensive position was in the division's hands by 14.00 and it pushed patrols ahead towards Sheria and its water supply. Sheria was captured at daybreak the following morning, without artillery preparation, but afterwards there was heavy fighting, and several Turkish counter-attacks were broken up by the field guns. The infantry brigade groups continued their advance the following day, supported by their artillery groups, and entered Huj.Dalbiac, pp. 126–35.Falls, Vol II, Pt I, pp. 98–100, 107–9, 119, 122. Drawing by James McBey of an RFA battery engaging Turkish batteries at Nebi Samwil. After a short rest at Huj, the division bivouacked at Gaza under heavy rain, then began a march through the mud to Junction Station, which it reached on 22 November. It now entered the last stage of the Battle of Nebi Samwil, where the objectives were a tangle of hill slopes, with tracks so bad that it was impossible to bring up the guns until roads had been made for them. Nebi Samwil had been captured by units of 75th Division, and the London battalions that relieved them came under fierce counter-attacks on 29 November; only the supporting British artillery fire allowed them to maintain their position. However, the way was now open to attack the final defences of Jerusalem; an encirclement was chosen, to avoid attacking the city itself. The surprise attack began on 8 December without artillery support; once progress had been made the batteries were to move up and come under command of the brigade groups. The going was tough for the guns, but CCCI Bde got though and eventually came into action within close rifle range of the enemy. C (H) Battery under Lt-Col Thatcher, together with C (H)/CCCII Bty, came up through Qalonye and supported 180th (2/5th London) Brigade's afternoon attack on the heights above Lifta; the hill was carried with great dash at the point of the bayonet. The battery suffered one officer mortally wounded, one man killed and 13 wounded. The division consolidated its gains that evening. The advance was resumed the following morning and the infantry fought their way into the suburbs of Jerusalem; there was little the artillery could do to support them. The Turks evacuated the city and the following morning the mayor and civic leaders surrendered the city to two sergeants of 2/19th Londons.Dalbiac, pp. 142–68.Falls, pp. 124, 126, 208, 218–9, 229, 237, 243–8, 251–2.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, p. 113. Monument to the surrender of Jerusalem to 60th (2/2nd London) Division. 60th (2/2nd L) Division was then pushed forward into positions from which to defend the captured city. Turkish counter-attacks began on 22 December, and a major attack followed on the night of 26/27 December. This was beaten off and the division took the opportunity to push forward up the Nablus Road into the hills over the following days. 60th Divisional Artillery made 'extraordinary exertions' to get its guns up to support attacks that captured the heights of Tahuneh and Shab Salah on 29 December. The Nablus Road defences were then garrisoned by 180th Bde with CCCI Bde in support.Dalbiac, pp. 178–88.Falls, Vol II, pp. 286–9. There was a pause in operations until February 1918 when the EEF moved to drive the Turks east of the Jordan. 60th (2/2nd L) Division advanced with three brigade groups, each supported by artillery, and worked its way forward between 14 and 21 February over rough country, after which the supporting Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade swept into Jericho, leaving the Turks with only small bridgeheads west of the Jordan. CCCI Brigade played no part in the Battle of Tell 'Asur that followed.Dalbiac, pp. 190–7.Falls, Vol II, pp. 303–9, 313. The former B/CCCI Bty, having served with 74th (Y) Division through the campaign from Gaza to Tell 'Asur as A/CCLXVIII, returned to CCCI on 21 March 1918 and resumed its position as B Bty. 60th Division next eliminated the Turkish bridgeheads and then crossed the river on the night of 21 March to carry out the First Transjordan raid. A Pontoon bridge was built at Ghoraniyeh, and the reinforced division advanced as far as Amman, though the field artillery could not get forward in the wet conditions, even with double teams of horses. Without artillery support the division failed to capture the Amman Citadel, and with its communications back to the Jordan threatened, the raiding force withdrew on 30–31 March. On the morning of 1 April, CCCI Bde, with B/CCCIII Bty attached, took up positions west of the Jordan to cover the last stage of the withdrawal, which was completed next day.Dalbiac, pp. 199–206.Falls, Vol II, pp. 331–48.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 118–20. The EEF settled down to defend its Jordan bridgeheads; CCCI Brigade was posted to support the Australian 2nd Light Horse Brigade and Imperial Camel Corps garrisoning a bridgehead at the Wadi el Auja confluence. The Turks attacked the Auja bridgehead on 11 April but were driven off, the artillery observers on the high ground to the west having 'an admirable view'.Falls, Vol II, pp. 358–61. Later that month the 60th (2/2nd L) Division played its part in the Second Transjordan raid. CCCI Brigade crossed the river at Ghoraniyeh on 29 April, but while the mounted troops reached Es Salt the Londoners could not break through the Turkish positions in the foothills, and the raiding force was withdrawn on 4 May. 60th (2/2nd L) Division then went into Corps Reserve for a rest.Dalbiac, pp. 215–9.Falls, Vol II, pp. 365–89.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 122–3. As a result of the German Spring Offensive and consequent manpower crisis on the Western Front, 60th (2/2nd L) Division was changed between 25 May and 1 August to an Indian Army establishment, releasing three-quarters of its London infantry units for service in France and replacing them with Indian units; however, this did not affect the artillery, which continued to serve with the division in Palestine.Dalbiac, pp. 220–4.Falls, Vol II, pp. 411–21. In July the Abu Tulul salient in the Jordan Valley was garrisoned by the 1st Light Horse Brigade when it was attacked by German troops bolstering the Turks. Among the artillery supporting this sector was C (H)/CCCI Bty. When the Australian unit in the front line heard the sound of movement in front at 01.00 on 14 July he called down a defensive barrage in front of his position; the enemy artillery also came into action, shelling the whole position. A serious attack came in at 03.30 as the Australians withdrew their outposts, but after a fierce fight the Light Horse recovered their positions and took hundreds of prisoners.Falls, Vol II, pp. 429–34. For the final offensive in Palestine, the Battle of Megiddo, 60th Division was transferred to the coastal sector where the breakthrough was to be made. The opening attack (the Battle of Sharon) went in at 04.30 on 19 September behind an intense artillery bombardment. As soon as the barrage programme was complete, the artillery moved up behind the infantry, who had gained their first objectives. 181st Brigade was ordered up from support at 06.15 and by 10.00 was advancing on Umm Sur with the two 18-pdr batteries of CCCI Bde, which had crossed the Nahr el Faliq. It then carried on to reach Tel Subik by 14.00, as the Turks streamed away in retreat. The 60th Division advanced for the next three days against enemy rearguards until it ran ahead of its supplies.Dalbiac, pp. 224–32.Falls, Vol II, pp. 464, 484–7.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, pp. 131–2. After the battle the pursuit was carried out by the mounted troops and 60th Division was left behind on salvage duties. It was still in the rear areas when the Armistice of Mudros ended the war with Turkey on 31 October. The division then went back to Alexandria where demobilisation began and units were gradually reduced to cadres, though still with some responsibility for internal security and seizing illegal arms. The division ceased to exist on 31 May 1919.Dalbiac, p. 233.Falls, Vol II, p. 623. Interwar The TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 and 6th London Bde, RFA, was reformed at Holland Road, Brixton, though its batteries were now numbered 13th–16th. In 1921 the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA), and its designations were changed: the unit now became 63rd (6th London) Brigade, RFA, with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 518. * 249 (13th London) Battery * 250 (14th London) Battery * 251 (15th London) Battery * 252 (16th London) Battery (Howitzer) When the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery on 1 June 1924, its units were redesignated as 'Field Brigades, RA'. In the reformed TA, 63rd (6th London) Field Bde was again part of 47th (2nd London) Division.Titles and Designations, 1927. However, in 1935 most of the division was converted into 1st Anti-Aircraft Division and the remaining London units including 63rd Fd Bde were organised into a single London Division. When the RA adopted the term 'regiment' instead of the obsolete 'brigade' for a lieutenant-colonel's command, the unit became 63rd (6th London) Field Regiment, RA, on 1 November 1938. However, this was short-lived: by the late 1930s a need for specialist anti-tank (A/T) artillery had been recognised, and the 63rd Fd Rgt was one of the first batch of TA units converted, becoming 52nd (6th London) Anti-Tank Regiment on 28 November 1938 with the batteries renumbered 205–8. The TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis of 1938, with existing units splitting to form duplicates shortly before the outbreak of World War II: 62nd Anti-Tank Regiment was formed at Stockwell with 245–8 Btys (it was granted the '6th London' subtitle in 1942).Frederick, pp. 914, 918.Frederick, p. 921. 52nd and 62nd Anti-Tank Rgts were both unattached units in London District.London District 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. The establishment of an A/T battery at this time was 12 x 2-pounder guns organised in Troops of four guns.Ellis France and Flanders, Appendix I. World War II=52nd (6th London) Anti-Tank RegimentBattle of France= On the outbreak of war 52nd A/T Rgt mobilised at Brixton under Lt-Col J.H. Page and then Lt-Col F.H.S. Pownall, and trained at Potters Bar. On 17 November, with a full complement of 48 2-pounder guns it sailed to join 5th Division, which was being assembled in the new British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. For the remainder of the war it served in this formation, alongside 91st (4th London) and 92nd (5th London) Fd Rgts.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex A.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 16, 20.Joslen, pp. 47–8.52 A/Tk Regt at RA 39–45. 2-Pounder A/T gun in the UK. During the Norwegian Campaign 5th Division was pulled out of the line and warned for a transfer to Norway, so that when the Battle of France began on 10 May, the division was in reserve. The BEF started its advance north into Belgium to defend the line of the Dyle in accordance with 'Plan D', and 5th Division reached as far as Brussels. But the German Army broke through the Ardennes to the east, forcing the BEF to withdraw again to the line of the Escaut. The anti-tank guns formed part of the rearguards. By 16 May 52nd A/T Rgt was covering the Hal–Leerbeck road, south west of Brussels, with 205 and 207 Btys detached with 13th and 17th Brigades respectively. By 19 May they had fallen back to Seclin, then on 20 May to Avion. By now the German breakthrough had cut the BEF off from the French armies. On that day 5th and 50th (Northumbrian) Divisions together with 1st Tank Brigade formed 'Frankforce' (under Maj-Gen H.E. Franklyn of 5th Division) to hold the south-facing salient around Arras. From Avion the regiment was ordered to send 206 and 208 Btys to Arras to join 50th (N) Division for a counter-attack.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter III.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IV.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, p. 34. Next day, Frankforce attacked the German Panzers moving west past Arras. Two columns were formed, each with a tank battalion, a battalion of the Durham Light Infantry from 50th (N) Division, and artillery from 5th Division; 206 A/T Bty accompanied the Left Column. The armoured thrust made some progress, but ran into strong opposition and was bombed by the Luftwaffe. The attacking columns withdrew at nightfall, but it is now recognised that the Arras counter-attack seriously delayed the German advance.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter V.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VI.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 52–3. On 22 May the Germans began crossing the River Scarpe from the west and by late afternoon on 23 May they were across in strength. At last light, Frankforce was ordered to hold out to the last round, but the situation in Arras was now hopeless and the BEF's commander, Lord Gort, changed the orders at midnight, directing Frankforce to move north out of the salient as quickly as possible. The gunners began a 'nightmare' withdrawal down the only road, which was being used by two divisions. Nevertheless, most of the garrison got away to new defensive positions on the canal between Béthune and La Bassée.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, p. 35.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VIII.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 61. On 26 May, Frankforce was rushed further north to plug a gap in the line left by the retreating Belgian army. 5th Division only arrived at the last minute, with the positions they were to occupy at Ploegsteert south of Ypres already under German shellfire. The commander of II Corps, Lt-Gen Alan Brooke, had little more than artillery to plug the gap, and he deployed much of it himself. He placed additional guns under the command of 5th Division, including some 18-pounders posted to 'thicken up' 52nd A/T Rgt's anti-tank screen. The fire of these guns held up the German advance for the whole day on 27 May (the Battle of the Ypres–Comines Canal), which ended with a bayonet charge by 2nd Bn Cameronians to stabilise the position for the night.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XI.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XII.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 62. On 26 May Gort had made the decision to evacuate the BEF from Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo). 5th Division held off the Germans on the canal for another whole day, then slipped away to the Yser on the night of 28/29 May. It was not seriously attacked the following day, and withdrew within the perimeter that night and embarked for England, but guns were required to stay behind to bolster 50th (N) Division's defences for a further 24 hours, and it was not until early on 1 June that the last of 5th Division's gunners destroyed their remaining equipment and were evacuated.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, pp. 35–6.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIII.France & Flanders, Chapter XIV.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 79, 83. =Home Defence= While reforming after Dunkirk, 5th Division was posted to Scottish Command, and assembled at Huntly Camp, Aberdeenshire. On 29 October 1940 the division moved down to Lancashire to join III Corps in Western Command, where it stayed (except for a spell in Northern Ireland) until 1942. The artillery were re-equipped with whatever guns were available until sufficient 2-pounders were ready.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, p. 36.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 102. On 1 November 1940 the 52nd A/T Rgt provided a cadre to help form 73rd A/T Rgt, which later served in North West Europe as XXX Corps' A/T unit. On 23 September 1941 it provided 205 (13th London) Bty to a newly formed 82nd A/T Rgt, which later served in the Far East. 205 Battery was replaced on 1 October by 303 Bty (originally numbered 299 Bty) formed by a cadre within the regiment at Moy, County Tyrone.Frederick, p. 923.Frederick, p. 924.Joslen, pp. 17, 515. =India and Persia= In January 1942 5th Division passed under direct War Office control preparatory to embarking for India in March. While part of the division was diverted for the invasion of Vichy French-controlled Madagascar, 52nd A/T Rgt and the rest of the division arrived in Bombay on 21 May. After concentrating, the division moved across India to Ranchi, the base area for the Burma Campaign. However, after less than three months in India, 5th Division was diverted again, this time to Persia, which was threatened by the German advance on the Caucasus. The division embarked for Basra and proceeded by road via Baghdad into Persia, where it spent the winter near Teheran. The threat to Persia having been diverted by the Battle of Stalingrad, 5th Division was next earmarked as an assault division for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). It proceeded via Baghdad to Damascus in Syria, where it trained for amphibious landings and mountain warfare. It moved to the Suez Canal zone of Egypt in June, and embarked on 5 July.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, pp. 37–9.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 365–6.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 264.Molony, Vol V, p. 26. =Sicily= The division landed in Sicily on 10 July 1943, and together with 50th Division advanced up the east coast to the plain of Catania, where they ran into stiffer opposition. On 13 July a Commando and paratroop attack (Operation Fustian) seized Primosole Bridge over the Simeto river and prevented its demolition, but was unable to retain possession of the bridge. 5th Division managed to achieve a limited bridgehead, but it proved impossible to push through until the Germans on the coast were outflanked by other formations and it remained under fire from the foothills until Eighth Army's flanking forces caused a German withdrawal that saw the division 'chasing his troops round the slopes of Mount Etna'. At this stage, 5th Division was withdrawn from the fighting to prepare for the invasion of mainland Italy (Operation Baytown).Anon, Lewisham Gunners, p. 39.Molony, Vol V, pp. 59, 69, 81–2, 93–6, 102–5, 114, 174, 177, 223. =Italy= 5th Division landed at Reggio di Calabria on 3 September 1943 and then advanced up the coast road to meet US Fifth Army. There was little opposition apart from demolitions and rearguard actions. Fifth Army then advanced up Italy, with 5th Division in the Apennines where the gunners' training in mountain warfare paid off. The division's advance was halted at Rionero when the Allies were held up at Monte Cassino and a succession of defended river lines.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, pp. 40–1.Molony, Vol V, pp. 234, 238, 335, 344. During this winter stalemate, 5th Division was transferred to the east coast to assist 1st Canadian Division at Ortona and 2nd New Zealand Division at Orsogna. These attacks were only moderately successful, so 5th Division was switched again, back to the west coast to cross the mouth of the Garigliano and outflank Cassino. The division's 'silent' assault crossing (without artillery fire) on the night of 17/18 January 1944 using beach landing techniques was successful in establishing a firm bridgehead that was held against enemy counter-attacks with the support of the guns, but without further troops it was impossible to advance further.Molony, Vol V, pp. 505–6, 594, 606–15. In March the division was sent to Anzio to relieve another division, and held a section of the line in a trench warfare stalemate that matched World War I. The war became mobile again after the capture of Cassino in May 1944, and 5th Division followed the retreating Germans as far as the Tiber before it was withdrawn for rest.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, pp. 41–2.Molony, Vol V, pp. 757–9.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 10, 220, 282.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, p. 15. =North West Europe= 5th Division handed over its guns and equipment to the newly arrived 46th Division and embarked for Egypt. After a period of rest and reorganisation, followed by internal security duties, in Palestine from July 1944 to February 1945, 5th Division was chosen for Operation Goldflake whereby troops from the Mediterranean theatre were transferred to reinforce 21st Army Group fighting in the final stages of the campaign in North West Europe. The division began to arrive at Taranto in Italy in mid-February and then re-embarked at Naples to be shipped to Marseilles on 8 March. It was concentrated near Ghent by 19 March.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, pp. 42–3.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 231, 380.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 162–3.Ellis, Germany, p. 213. The division had not re-equipped in time for the Crossing of the Rhine, but took part in a number of actions in the pursuit to the Elbe. After the assault crossing of that river on 29 April, 5th Division passed through the bridgehead to continue the pursuit. By now there was only scattered resistance and thousands of prisoners were collected. Hostilities ended on VE Day.Anon, Lewisham Gunners, p. 43.Ellis, Germany, pp. 285, 337. 52nd (6th London) Anti-Tank Regiment served in the occupation forces in Germany (British Army of the Rhine, BAOR) until RHQ and the four batteries were placed in suspended animation on 11 November 1946. 62nd (6th London) Anti-Tank RegimentHome Defence= On the outbreak of war the new regiment mobilised at Stockwell and on 7 October 1939 it joined 2nd London Division, which was being reformed as a motor division (it was redesignated 47th (London) Division on 21 November 1940). During the Battle of France 2nd London Division was classed as a training formation in Eastern Command, responsible for the defence of London itself. After Dunkirk, it moved to South Wales under Western Command, but by February 1941 it was equipped and trained, taking responsibility for the defence of the coast of Sussex.Joslen, p. 41.Collier, Maps 5, 17, 21.62 A/Tk Regt at RA 39–45. On 28 July 1941 an additional battery, 294, was formed by a cadre within the regiment at East Grinstead. On 1 October that year 294 Bty joined 81st A/T Rgt, which served with 1st Division in Tunisia and Italy.Joslen, pp. 35–6. In December 1941 47th (L) Division was placed on a lower establishment, remaining as a coast defence formation in the Hampshire & Dorset District, but not expected to serve overseas. On 11 August 1942, 247 A/T Bty was disbanded. However, 62nd A/T Rgt left the division on 14 February 1943 and came under War Office Control as a mobile part of the field army, with its own Light Aid Detachment of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Shortly afterwards it was attached to I Corps in 21st Army Group training for the planned Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). 247 Battery was reformed on 25 June 1943.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, files WO 212/9 and WO 33/1987.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, TNA file WO 212/238. For the next year the regiment was engaged in a series of training exercises, at first in Scotland and later on the South Coast of England, with final rehearsal landings made at Slapton Sands and Studland Bay.Tony Foulds, 'In Support of the Canadians: A British Anti-Tank Regiment's First Five Weeks in Normandy', Canadian Military History, 1998, Vol 7, Issue 2. =D-Day= I Corps' 'spearhead' formation sign. For 'Overlord', as Corps anti-tank regiment, 62nd A/T Rgt was equipped with two batteries (246 and 247) of 17-pounder guns towed by turretless Crusader tanks, and two self-propelled (SP) batteries (245 and 248) with US-supplied M10 tank destroyers converted to 17-pdr SP Achilles standard. Each battery comprised three Troops of four guns. On the evening of 5 June 1944, 245 and 246 Btys sailed from Tilbury Docks while 247 and 248 sailed from Southampton. I Corps was to land on two beaches: Sword (3rd British Division) and Juno (3rd Canadian Division). Two batteries (246 and 248) of 62nd A/T Rgt were assigned to support 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade landing on 'Mike' and 'Nan' beaches in Juno sector, while the other two batteries were in reserve for 3rd Canadian Division. The Achilles of 248 Bty's J Troop were directly attached to The Royal Regina Rifles and K Trp to the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, landing either side of Courseulles-sur-Mer. K Troop landed at 15.00, two hours late because of problems with the Rhino ferry on which it was carried, and it was hurried through the beach exits to catch up with the Winnipegs, now inland. By 10.00 next day the Winnipegs were on their objective with the four Achilles deployed covering the lanes passing under the embankment of the Caen–Bayeux railway. Later in the day the Canadians' own 6-pounder A/T guns arrived to take over, and K Trp was withdrawn into reserve. J Troop had landed late in the afternoon of D-Day and pushed forward to Bretteville-l'Orgueilleuse on D+1. When the Canadian guns arrived that evening, the Achilles joined those of newly arrived L Trp to cover 7th Canadian Bde's thinly-held left flank. So far the regiment had not fired a shot.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 173, 178–82, 206–9; Appendix IV, pp. 524, 546.Joslen, pp. 463, 583. Towed 17-pounder A/T gun in action. 246 Battery had arrived off Mike Red beach at 14.00 on D-Day but had been stood off, bombed during the night, and not finally put ashore until 17.30 next day (D+1). When they reached 7th Canadian Bde HQ, F Trp was sent to the long left flank, D Trp into Brettevile, and E Trp to support the Canadian Scottish on the right flank. At about 09.45 on D+2 a force from 12th SS Panzer Division with nine tanks began an attack against the wood held by the Canadian Scottish. Four tanks were knocked out by E Trp's 17-pdrs and the Canadian 6-pdrs, but two of the 17-pdrs were themselves knocked out. The troop commander, Lt Gerry Blanchard, brought up another gun from the rear and reorganised his crews, laying and firing one of the guns himself. Although the position was mortared and shelled, the Germans did not renew the attack. E Troop had suffered four killed, seven wounded and two missing; Lt Blanchard was awarded an MC. On the left at Putot-en-Bessin the Winnipegs were being overwhelmed by two Panzergrenadier battalions; at 20.30 the Canadian Scottish with some tanks made a counter-attack in which the four Achilles of K Trp advanced immediately behind the leading infantry companies. After a fierce struggle Putot was regained, and K Trp's guns were deployed along its forward edge, covering the railway line. During an uneasy night the Achilles crews fired their Browning machine guns to give the Canadians support.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 228–30. Of the two batteries in divisional reserve, 247 did not get ashore until the afternoon of D+1, when two of its troops were rushed up too late to take part in 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade's first action with 12th SS Panzer Division. It then spent three weeks in the line, shelled and mortared, but not firing a shot. 245 Battery had been even more delayed in landing, and after coming ashore on D+2 was transferred to the eastern sector to support 3rd British and 6th Airborne Division in the bridgehead across the River Orne, where it accounted for four German tanks. On 11 June the Canadians made a costly attack on Le Mesnil-Patry, which was repulsed. In case the Germans seized the opportunity for a counterattack 248 Battery was rushed up in support, with the troops deployed to Norrey-en-Bessin, Bretteville and Putot, but the expected attack did not materialise. After this the Canadian sector quietened down for about three weeks. 246 and 247 Batteries remained with 7th and 8th Canadian Infantry Brigades while 248 Bty was transferred to the 3rd British Division, which attacked and captured Chateau de Londe on 27–28 June, where 248 Bty knocked out its first German tank.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 252–3, 286. On 3 July elements of 246 and 248 Btys moved south to join the Canadians in Operation Windsor to capture Carpiquet Airfield next day. E and F Troops of 246 Bty supported 8th Canadian Bde, while K Trp of 248 Bty was with the Royal Winnipegs, attached to the brigade. E Troop followed the Régiment de la Chaudière into Carpiquet village, deployed its 17-pdrs along the southern edge, and helped to throw back a counter-attack. The troop remained in these positions under shellfire for the next five days. Meanwhile, K Trp had followed the Winnipegs across open ground towards the airfield, with two Achilles supporting the lead companies, and two back. The infantry repeatedly tried to get onto the airfield, but their attacking armour was drawn back; at one point the Achilles were alone on the open slope. In the evening the infantry were withdrawn to their start line, covered by K Trp.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 309–10. German personnel examine a knocked-out Achilles of 245 Bty after the engagement at Buron. =Buron= Operation Windsor was a preliminary for Operation Charnwood, to capture Caen itself. For this 245 Bty with its Achilles was brought back from across the Orne in exchange for the towed 17-pdrs of 247 Bty, while 248 Bty supported the newly landed 59th (Staffordshire) Division. At 07.30 on 8 July, A and B Trps of 245 Bty followed the Highland Light Infantry of Canada towards the heavily defended village of Buron, and after the infantry's fierce fight were able to deploy along its forward edge at about 09.00, with A Trp covering the southern and western approaches, and B Trp facing south east. Not long afterwards enemy shell and mortar fire increased and a battle group of 20–30 Panzer IV and Panther tanks from12th SS Panzer Division launched a counter-attack. As the German tanks moved across in front of its positions, 245 Bty engaged them, destroying 13 for the loss of six Achilles (four of which were later recovered). This was the most celebrated anti-tank action during the campaign, but it cost the two troops two officers and four other ranks dead, and six more wounded. Later in the day the three serviceable guns joined the North Nova Scotia Highlanders as they advanced through Buron to take Authie, and then deployed along the edge of that village. After Buron the battery commander received an MC and two of the gun sergeants were awarded the MM. The battery's other troop had followed the Canadian Scottish Regiment into Cussy and engaged several enemy tanks without success. 248 Battery had been involved in 59th Division's assaults on La Bijude and Épron. Next day elements of 246 and 245 Btys advanced with the Canadians and K Trp of 248 Bty provided support from the flank, but none of their guns came into action while Caen was finally secured.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 314–5. After the capture of Caen, 62nd A/T Rgt's batteries were widely scattered during the remainder of the Normandy Campaign, supporting various formations. Once 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead and began driving eastwards, the regiment continued to serve with I Corps under First Canadian Army in Clearing the Channel Coast. This included the capture of Le Havre (Operation Astonia) and the drive towards Antwerp.Ellis, Germany, pp. 13–5, 59–60, 69–70, 92, 125–6; Appendix IV.245 Bty at RA Netherlands. =Clarkeforce= The strategic requirement now was to clear the Scheldt Estuary and get the port of Antwerp into use as an Allied supply base.Ellis, Germany, pp. 99–100, 109–10. 49th (West Riding) Division was to attack towards Loenhout, and then unleash a mobile force to exploit the breakthrough and move up the main road to Wuustwezel in Operation Rebound. This mobile force was commanded by Brigadier W.S. Clarke of 34th Tank Brigade and named 'Clarkeforce'. Clarkeforce consisted of Churchill tanks of 107th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps carrying infantry of 1st Bn Leicestershire Regiment, accompanied by a troop of Achilles from 248 Bty, Churchill Crocodile flame- throwing tanks of the 1st Fife and Forfar Yeomanry, 25-pounder field guns of 191st (Hertfordshire & Essex Yeomanry) Field Rgt and sections of the Royal Engineers (RE). Operation Rebound (part of the larger offensive of Operation Pheasant) began on 20 October with the seizure of Stapelheide as a start line for Clarkeforce, which was launched through the gap at 16.00.Sainsbury, pp. 239–44.34 Tank Bde War Diary October 1944, TNA file WO 171/643.107 RAC War Diary October 1944, TNA file WO 171/876. The column bypassed some strongpoints to be mopped up by supporting troops, but progress was slow: the route was restricted to one tank's width and the going was bad. A fight for 'Stone Bridge' took most of the remaining daylight, but the bridge was seized before it could be completely demolished and the tanks and infantry pushed on in the dark to clear Wuustwezel. By 22.00, infantry of 49th (WR) Division had moved up to relieve Clarkeforce, which pressed on: 'The night was pitch dark, it was raining, and there was no moon'. Progress was slow and the armoured vehicles had to clear roadblocks of trees. During the second day of the advance the enemy put in counter-attacks that succeeded briefly in cutting the road at Stone Bridge and isolating the leading troops, but these were beaten off. On 22–24 October Clarkeforce pushed on to Essen. Clarkeforce rested on 25 October to plan the next phase of its advance towards Roosendaal(Operation Thruster), and 245 Bty was now brought across from Eindhoven, to provide the A/T support. Because the best A/T gun the Churchills had was only the 6-pdr, which was outranged by the 75mm and 88mm guns of the dug-in and camouflaged German SP guns, the Achilles had to do the bulk of the work with their 17-pdrs. They and the Churchills also had to use their A/T guns to destroy concrete obstacles and allow the RE bulldozers to make a massive anti-tank ditch passable. By the end of 26 October C Trp had lost two M10s and was withdrawn. Next day a composite troop of three B Trp and two C Trp guns was formed, but two more were lost, and a third on 28 October during an attack on Wouwe covered by smoke and by the guns of the remaining Achilles.Ellis, Germany, pp. 92, 125–6. 49th (WR) Division found the approaches to Roosendaal strongly held, and a set-piece artillery- and armour-supported assault was laid on. However, a patrol infiltrated the town under cover of mist and found that the Germans had pulled out.Buckley, pp. 246–7. The division's final objective was Willemstad on the Hollands Diep (part of the Maas Estuary). This was away across poor country for armour, so Clarkeforce was disbanded and the division carried out a conventional infantry advance.Ellis, Germany, pp. 126–7. After this fighting died down I Corps held the Maas front through the winter. In December the gunners of 245 Bty were doing duty as infantry along the riverbank. Fears of a German incursion over the river in support of their Ardennes Offensive came to nothing. In January 1945, 245 Bty was stationed at Sint Philipsland, where its SP guns were used as field artillery. On 22 January a German raid across the river led to the battery's only infantry action, and its last fatal casualties of the campaign. I Corps became an administrative HQ and its units played no part in the Battle of the Reichswald (Operation Veritable) or the assault crossing of the Rhine in early 1945. After VE Day it became part of BAOR, with 245 Bty crossing into Germany on 4 June.Ellis, Germany, pp. 238–40. 62nd (6th London) Anti-Tank Regiment with its four batteries passed into suspended animation on 4 February 1946. Postwar On 1 January 1947 the regiment was reconstituted at Brixton as 263 (6th London) Anti-Tank Regiment (and 62nd A/T Rgt was formally disbanded). The regiment provided the A/T component of 56th (London) Armoured Division. Subsequently, it was reconverted to a field regiment (1 March 1951), then a self-propelled medium regiment (1 August 1954).Frederick, p. 998.Watson, TA 1947.235–265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards. On 31 October 1956 the regiment absorbed the Kent parts of 415 (Thames & Medway) Coast Regiment to become 263 (6th London) Light Regiment. Finally on 1 May 1961 it was amalgamated with 291 (4th London) Field Regiment, 298 (Surrey Yeomanry) Field Regiment and 381 (Surrey) Light Regiment to form 263 (Surrey Yeomanry (Queen Mary's Regiment)) Field Regiment. The old 263 Rgt provided RHQ at Sutton in the new combined regiment, while the Sheerness and Gravesend batteries, originally from 415 (Thames & Medway) Coast Rgt, were converted into Royal Engineers as part of 211 (Thames & Medway) Field Squadron.Barnes, Appendix V.444–473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.

He was awarded the Navy Cross at the battle of Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War.  Early life and World War II  Allan Sutter was born on June 14, 1914, in Mount Holly, New Jersey. After graduating from Valley Forge Military Academy, Sutter attended Dartmouth College and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1937. He then completed the Platoon Leader Program at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia in July and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Sutter received additional training at The Basic School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His first assignment was as the assistant communications officer in the 5th Marine Regiment. He then attended Communications Officers School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, before he served as the aide to the commanding general of the 1st Marine Division. Sutter led the 1st Signal Company during the battle of Guadalcanal from August to December 1942. He later served as the executive officer of the III Amphibious Corps Signal Battalion during the battle of Guam in July and August 1944, and during the battle of Okinawa from April to June 1945. Sutter participated in the occupation of Northern China after the war, returning to the United States in 1946.  Korean War = Inchon-Seoul campaign  When the Korean War started, Lieutenant Colonel Sutter was given command of 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines. Sutter led his battalion during the amphibious assault at Blue Beach One at Inchon on September 15, 1950. His first wave of Marines landed at 1730 hours, followed shortly after by a second wave. However, the next three waves from his battalion drifted off course and mistakenly landed on Blue Beach Three. By the afternoon of September 16, Sutter's battalion had pushed two miles inland and had taken Hill 117 which overlooked the highway toward Seoul. Later that night, his battalion helped repel a North Korean counterattack. Early on the morning of September 20, his battalion destroyed another enemy counterattack which was composed of five tanks and 300 men outside of Yongdung-po. Private First Class Walter C. Monegan Jr. personally destroyed two T-34s before he was killed. Later that day, Sutter requested an artillery fire mission which took seven hours to be approved. On the morning of September 21, Sutter's battalion took particularly heavy casualties while attacking Yongdung-po. After reaching the Han River outside of Seoul on September 22, his battalion was placed in the regimental reserve. 2/1 had sustained 116 casualties as a result of seven days of aggressively assaulting \\"without the required artillery preparation.\\" On September 26, Sutter continued to lead 2/1 in urban combat during the recapture of Seoul. The house-to-house fighting was agonizingly slow for the Marines, who would typically spend one hour clearing each position. While the city was effectively secured by September 28, there were still enemy pockets of resistance for the next few days. On September 29, an observation post occupied by Company E on Hill 132 was attacked by approximately 100 of the enemy. Private First Class Stanley R. Christianson remained in a listening post where he personally killed seven of the enemy before he himself was killed and bought time for his platoon to mount a defense which repelled the attack.  Chosin Reservoir campaign  At the conclusion of the Inchon- Seoul campaign in the first week of October, the entire 1st Marine Division embarked on Navy ships and sailed around South Korea and landed at Wonsan on October 26. The division then marched 70 miles north to the Chosin Reservoir area. As Sutter's battalion arrived at Koto-ri on November 24, the Chinese Communist military encircled the entire division and the coldest winter in 50 years descended on Korea. Temperatures fell as low as −35 °F as a blizzard swept the area. On the night of November 29, a large enemy force assaulted 2/1's entrenched position outside of Koto-ri. Lieutenant Colonel Sutter skillfully directed his Marines in repulsing the attack, killing 175 of the enemy and wounding several hundred more. On December 10, Sutter led his Marines in an attack toward Sudong-ni. He attained his objective with minimal losses despite suffering from a fever. The Marines reached Hungnam by December 11 and were evacuated by ships by December 24. For his actions during the Chosin Reservoir campaign, Sutter was awarded the Navy Cross. Sutter continued serving in Korea and eventually became the executive officer of the 1st Marine Regiment. He returned to the United States in May 1951 and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service.  Later career and life  After the war, Sutter served as the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 for the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific. From August 1961 to June 1962, he served as the commanding officer of the 4th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade, at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Colonel Sutter retired from the Marines in 1964. He died on July 12, 1988, in Orange, Virginia. He was buried in Quantico National Cemetery.

(ed.) (1998) Catalog of fishes., Special Publication, California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco. 3 vols. 2905 p. or the obscure pufferfish is a species of euryhaline, anadromous pufferfish first described by T. Abe in 1949. It has been categorized by the IUCN as a least- concern species globally since 2014; in South Korea, it is however classified as an endangered species due to overfishing of its endemic populations.Doopedia The Catalogue of Life lists no subspecies of Takifugu obscurus. The species prefers deeper, clearer areas of brackish and fresh water, and is found estuaries, as well as rivers and tributaries thereof such as the South Korean rivers Geum, Han, and Imjin, or the Tamsui River in mainland China. The species is endemic to North and South Korea, the Sea of Japan, and the East and South China Seas. Uses of Takifugu obscurus include human consumption, use in animal testing, and owning specimens as pets. As with most species of pufferfish, several organs of Takifugu obscurus contain tetrodotoxin, making it potentially poisonous if not prepared safely by trained persons.  Morphology  Takifugu obscurus is characterized by the following traits: * Body, especially ventral region or \\"belly\\" covered in prickles * Dark spots on either side, above and often somewhat behind the pectoral fins * One larger dark spot surrounding the base of the dorsal fin * A blunt snout and small mouth * A maximum length of 40cm * 15-19 dorsal soft rays, 13-16 anal soft rays, no dorsal or anal spines * While the fish is alive, a yellowish tint to the fins  References  Bibliography  * Eschmeyer, William N.: Genera of Recent Fishes.

Description The player characters, all members of the gyspy-like S'Danzo, have been chosen to escort an elderly man carrying three \\"spirit stones\\" to the city of Sanctuary and beyond. On the way to Sanctuary, the old man is killed by a man with a scarred face, and the stones stolen. Now the players must enter Sanctuary on a quest to recover the Stones, which have changed hands several times already, and then complete the old man's mission. The book opens with a description of S'Danzo society, as well as a short explanation of the role-playing rules used in the Thieves' World role-playing game. Publication history The Spirit Stones is a 44-page saddle-stitched softcover book written by Bill Fawcett and Lynn Abbey, with interior art by Jim Clouse, floor plans by Jordan Weisman, and cover art by Mitch O'Connell. The 1982 book was the second Thieves' World adventure published by FASA. Reception In the February 1983 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #38), Oliver Dickinson thought the \\"plots and sub-plots have been carefully thought out and all possibilities seem to be well covered\\", and that \\"presentation is reasonably good\\". But he also commented that \\"each page has a sprinkling of misprints and minor errors and the language is sometimes clumsy.\\" He also noted some variance with the rules set out in the Thieves' World RPG, such as the relative coinage values of copper, silver, and gold coins. He concluded by giving the book an average rating of 7 out of 10, saying, \\"All in all, these look like testing and enjoyable adventures.\\" Other reviews *Different Worlds #34 (May/June, 1984) Other recognition A copy of The Spirit Stones is part of the collection at The Strong National Museum of Play (item 110.32760).

Mount Pulitzer is the sixth-highest peak in the Bailey Range, which is a subrange of the Olympic Mountains. Its nearest neighbor is Mount Ferry, to the northeast, and its nearest higher neighbor is Stephen Peak, to the north. Mount Olympus is set to the southwest. In clear weather, the mountain can be seen from the visitor center at Hurricane Ridge. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Elwha and Hoh Rivers. Etymology This peak was named by the 1889-90 Seattle Press Expedition after Joseph Pulitzer (1847–1911), newspaper publisher of the New York World, his name is now best known for the Pulitzer Prize. The mountain was originally called Mt. Ferry before it was renamed. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Pulitzer is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. This climate supports a small un-named glacier on the north slope. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing and climbing. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times. See also * Olympic Mountains * Geology of the Pacific Northwest Mts.

It is Roud Folk Song Index no. 10508. The origins of both tune and words are uncertain. It was sung by British and ANZAC soldiers during World War I, but may be an older song of the prewar British regular army, or even have origins dating back to the English Civil War in the 17th century. In those World War I armies, the quartermaster's department was responsible for stores and supplies. The song lists its supposed characteristics, many of them slovenly or unhygienic. The song was known in the United States by the 1930s; it was sung by the Lincoln Battalion, a unit of American volunteers who fought against fascism in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). During World War II, the song was popular in the RAF as well as the Army. The song has gained wide popularity outside the military sphere, particularly as a campfire song in the Scouting and Guiding movements. The Barmy Army, supporters of the England cricket team, have been known to sing about England international cricketers Stuart Broad and his father Chris to the tune of \\"The Quartermaster's Store\\".

The intention of the act was to correct minor errors and to streamline the law in respect of areas which are to be consolidated under the Sentencing Act 2020. The overall purpose of the law (together with the Sentencing Act 2020) is to remove historic and redundant layers of sentencing procedural legislation without introducing new sentencing law. Provisions=Main Provisions Clause 1 provides for a \\"clean sweep\\" to remove the need to identify and apply historic versions of the law, minimising the use of complex transitional provisions. The clean sweep is subject to exceptions to ensure that no offender is subject to a greater penalty than that available at the time of the offence, or subject to a minimum or mandatory sentence that did not apply at the time of the offence. Clause 2 provides for amendments and modifications of existing sentencing legislation to allow for a consistent consolidation and gives powers to the Secretary of State to make further amendments by way of statutory instrument. The remaining clauses deal with interpretation, how regulations may be laid, the commencement, extent and short title of the Act. Schedules Schedule 1 provides for a list of exemptions to the \\"clean sweep\\" which are required in order to comply with Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights and so as not to breach common law standards of fairness. Schedule 2 provides for pre-consolidation amendments to existing legislation to enable the enactment of consolidation. Such amendment include amendments to the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, Criminal Justice Act 2003, Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, Armed Forces Act 2006 and other primary and secondary legislation relating to sentencing.

The division was formed in the 3rd Guards Army of Southwestern Front and immediately continued operations in the Soviet winter counteroffensive. In the spring of the year the Front was forced over to the defensive, but by August the division was part of the 34th Guards Rifle Corps of the same Army, fighting into the Donbass and towards the Dniepr River and winning a battle honor in the process. In late October 3rd Guards Army was moved to 4th Ukrainian Front and the 61st Guards helped helped force several crossings of that river in the Zaporozhe area. During the winter it took part in the fighting around Nikopol and Krivoi Rog in the Dniepr bend before being reassigned, with its Corps, to the 6th Army in the 3rd Ukrainian Front. In April, as that Army advanced towards the Dniestr River the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the liberation of Odessa. When the final offensive that drove Romania out of the Axis began the 61st Guards was in the 66th Rifle Corps of 37th Army, still in 3rd Ukrainian Front. In November, as the campaigns into the Balkan states continued the division made its final transfer, to the 6th Guards Rifle Corps of 57th Army, still in 3rd Ukrainian Front. It ended the war advancing into Austria, was moved to Romania postwar, and was disbanded in December, 1946. Formation The 159th was redesignated as the 61st Guards on January 15 and officially received its Guards banner on February 21. Once the division completed its reorganization its order of battle was as follows: * 181st Guards Rifle Regiment (from 491st Rifle Regiment) * 187th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 558th Rifle Regiment) * 189th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 631st Rifle Regiment) * 129th Guards Artillery Regiment (from 597th Artillery Regiment) * 67th Guards Antitank Battalion (from 136th Antitank Battalion)Charles C.

Gen. Mikhail Borisovich Anashkin, who had led the 159th since mid-August, remained in command of the division until February 12, shortly before he was assigned to command the new 19th Rifle Corps. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. Leonid Nikolaievich Lozanovich who would remain in command until December, 1944. Fighting for Voroshilovgrad When redesignated the 159th was under command of the 14th Rifle Corps and it would remain under that headquarters into February.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 16, 39 On January 8 the commander of Southwestern Front, Col. Gen. N. F. Vatutin, had reported to the STAVKA on his plans to further develop the winter counteroffensive:By the beginning of February the 3rd Guards Army held a bridgehead over the Northern Donets River south of Voroshilovgrad from which it broke out in a drive to liberate that city.David M. Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 135-37 In the plan for the offensive the 14th Rifle Corps (now consisting of the 14th and 61st Guards Divisions) was not part of the Army's shock group but was instead to reach a line from Georgievskoe to Orekhova to Semeikino to guard its flank from any attack from the southwest. By February 4 the 14th Corps, supported by the 169th Tank Brigade, was operating in the area of heights 207, 202.8 and 206.9. Two days later German forces counterattacked the 61st Guards but were repelled; on February 7 a more powerful attack was made by elements of the 3rd SS Panzer Division supported by 40 tanks which broke through the Soviet front and captured Orlovka, Belo-Skelevatyi and Nizhnii and Verkhnii Gabun. This attack brought the advance on Voroshilovgrad to a halt.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part V, ch. 1 At 0500 hours on February 12 the 14th Corps renewed its offensive. The 558th Rifle Regiment of the 61st Guards, along with the training battalion of 14th Guards and two battalions of the 229th Rifle Brigade, attacked the German garrisons in Belo-Skelevatyi and Orlovka and drove them out with heavy casualties. At the same time the 14th Guards seized the village of Popovka and the Corps as a whole began advancing rapidly to the southwest, with the 61st Guards reaching a line from Glafirovka to the Karl Liebknecht State Farm by the end of February 14. On the morning of the same day the fighting for the city proper had begun and by evening it was completely in Soviet hands.Soviet General Staff, Rollback, Kindle ed., Part V, ch. 1 The advance of 3rd Guards Army continued over the next week; on the morning of February 21 General Vatutin reported, in part, that the 61st (which was now in 18th Rifle Corps) and 60th Guards Divisions, 279th Rifle Division, and the 229th Rifle Brigade had conducted a regrouping overnight and into the morning before going over to the attack from Kripaki and Smelyi toward Krivorozhe in the evening.Glantz, After Stalingrad, p. 162 Vatutin and the STAVKA had every intention of pressing on towards Stalino, but on February 20 the German 4th and 1st Panzer Armies began the counteroffensive that would become the Third Battle of Kharkov. While this was primarily aimed at Voronezh Front, Southwestern Front also faced attacks and the overall crisis made any further Soviet advance impossible.John Erickson, The Road to Berlin, Weidenfeld and Nicolson Ltd., London, UK, 1983, pp. 49-54 Into Ukraine Map of the Donbass Offensive (in German) By the beginning of March the division had returned to 14th Rifle Corps, where it remained into April when it was transferred to the 34th Guards Rifle Corps; it would remain under this command for the next 13 months.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 65, 88, 113 During the pause in operations during the spring of 1943 the division was substantially rebuilt and in June it was noted that 95 percent of its personnel were of Kazakh nationality, with the remainder mostly Russian.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 596 When the Donbass Offensive began on August 13 the 61st Guards helped 3rd Guards Army force a crossing of the Donets. Following this it drove across the eastern Ukrainian plains towards Dniepropetrovsk and the Dniepr bend.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 69 During this advance, on September 8 the division was awarded an honorific:By the beginning of October the division had just run up against a bridgehead that the German forces were attempting to hold on the east bank of the Dniepr east of Zaporozhe. The STAVKA demanded that this bridgehead be eliminated as quickly as possible. The Front commander, Army Gen. R. Ya. Malinovsky, asked for and was granted the use of the 8th Guards Army for this purpose, stating that with it he could take the objective \\"in two days\\". The attack began at 2200 hours on the night of October 13 with 8th Guards in the center, 12th Army advancing from the north and 3rd Guards Army from the south. Malinovsky met his deadline with time to spare as 1st Panzer Army's forces abandoned Zaporozhe, destroying the dam and the railway bridge as they withdrew to the west bank.Erickson, The Road to Berlin, pp. 138-39 Following the Zaporozhe bridgehead battle the 3rd Guards Army was transferred to the 4th Ukrainian Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 282 This Front had begun a new offensive against the German 6th Army on October 9 with the objectives of liberating Melitopol and cutting off the German 17th Army in the Crimea. The fighting for Melitopol continued until October 23, after which two of the Front's armies drove west across the Nogay Steppe, splitting 6th Army in two. The northern portion fell back toward the Dniepr, forming a bridgehead south of Nikopol which was soon invested by 3rd Guards Army on the right (north) flank of the Front. During November substantial German reserves were moved into the bridgehead in anticipation of an offensive to restore communications with Crimea. This came to nothing in the face of Soviet threats elsewhere, but the bridgehead remained strongly held.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History United States Army, Washington, DC, 1968, pp. 176-79, 184, 186 Nikopol-Krivoi Rog Offensive Nikopol-Krivoi Rog Offensive.A cold wave in the first week of January, 1944 firmed up the ground enough for the 4th and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts to begin moving against the remaining German positions in the Dniepr bend. 3rd Ukrainian began its assault on January 10, but this had largely failed by the 13th. On the same day the 4th Ukrainian attacked the bridgehead but made minimal gains before both Fronts called a halt on January 16. The offensive was renewed on January 30 against a bridgehead weakened by transfers and 4th Ukrainian drove a deep wedge into its south end. On February 4 the German 6th Army ordered the bridgehead to be evacuated.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 240-42 Later that month the 34th Guards Corps, along with the 61st Guards, was transferred to the 6th Army in 3rd Ukrainian Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 78 Battle for Odessa With the diversion of 4th Ukrainian Front into the Crimea, 3rd Ukrainian took up the southern flank as the Red Army pressed onward into western Ukraine. On March 26 General Malinovsky ordered a renewed offensive in the direction of Odessa, which included the 6th Army. At this time the 34th Guards Corps consisted of the 61st and 59th Guards and 243rd Rifle Divisions. On April 4 Cavalry-Mechanized Group Pliyev and the lead elements of 37th Army captured the town of Razdelnaia, again splitting German 6th Army in two. 6th Army was now ordered to envelop Odessa from the northwest. After heavy fighting the 5th Shock Army entered the city's northern suburbs on the evening of April 9. Overnight the forward elements of 8th Guards Army, 6th Army, and the Pliyev Group also drew up to the Odessa defenses. With the Soviet trap closing the German LXXII Army Corps began breaking out to the west, allowing the Soviet forces to liberate the city by 1000 hours on April 10 after only minor fighting.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 110, 114, 118, 120-22 On April 20 the 61st Guards would be awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the fighting for Odessa. First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive Once the 6th Army completed its part in the liberation of Odessa, Malinovsky ordered it to spend a week resting and refitting west of the city and then to move west to the Dniestr to reinforce the Front's advance on Chișinău. On about April 14 the Army commander, Lt. Gen. I. T. Shlemin, received orders to move across the river to occupy positions south of Tiraspol that had been vacated by the 6th Guards Rifle Corps of 37th Army. The Army's immediate objectives would be the German strongholds at Fantina-Mascui and Grădinița and the 8km of front between them. For a variety of reasons Shlemin's forces were delayed in making their crossing and their offensive was delayed until April 25. 6th Army faced a battlegroup formed from the German 15th Infantry Division.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 152-53 When finally prepared for action 34th Guards Corps was deployed with the 59th and 61st Guards in the first echelon opposite the boundary between the 15th Infantry battlegroup and the 97th Jäger Division at and north of Grădinița; the 243rd Rifle Division was in second echelon. Led by assault battalions formed by the first-echelon divisions the Corps began its assault at 0200 hours following a 15-minute fire raid on the German positions. The 59th and 61st captured the forward defensive positions of the 97th Jägers and advanced roughly 1.5km westward by the end of the day but were unable to seize the strongpoint at Grădinița. Repeated assaults over the next three days fared no better and the Corps was ordered to go over to the defense on April 29.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 153-55 Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive Map of Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive (in German). Note position of 37th Army. In May the 6th Army was disbanded and the 61st Guards was transferred to the 66th Rifle Corps of 37th Army, still in 3rd Ukrainian Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 170 During the new offensive, which began on August 20, 37th Army's immediate objective was to break through the enemy's heavily fortified defensive zone so the Army's mobile group, 7th Mechanized Corps, could be committed into a clean breach. Two of 66th Corps' divisions (61st Guards and 333rd Rifle Division) were in first echelon and the 244th Rifle Division was behind the 333rd. The Corps was backed by a total of two artillery brigades, a mortar brigade, a howitzer regiment, two anti-tank regiments plus an additional battalion, a Guards Mortar regiment, a tank and a self-propelled artillery regiment, plus combat engineer elements. The 61st was on the right flank and was deployed in two echelons, with the 181st and 189th Guards Regiments up and the 187th back. The Corps was to launch its main attack in the general direction of height 151.7 and height 210.4 and break through the German defense between Fantina-Mascui and a grove 2km east of height 151,7 with the immediate task of capturing the crest line east of Cîrnățeni. By the end of the second day the Corps was to occupy a line from Căușeni to Opaci.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 176-77, 179, 183 37th Army's offensive began with a reconnaissance-in-force by five penal companies with significant artillery support at 0500 hrs on August 20. The main artillery preparation began at 0800, and continued for 105 minutes. As early as 1030 hours the defenders had lost the first and second trenches of their first defensive position. The 61st captured height 151.7 and Fantina- Mascui by 1100 hours but then came under heavy small arms fire from Plop- Știubei and several counterattacks from Cîrnățeni which delayed the progress of the division's right-flank regiment. Meanwhile the 189th Guards Regiment on the left flank continued to advance and by 1300 hours had captured some houses in the ravine southeast of Plop-Știubei. Due to this resistance the division was forced to deploy with its front facing northwest.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 233-35. Note this source misnumbers the 189th Regiment as the 199th. Meanwhile the 333rd Division, with armor support, had broken through the Germans' first and second positions and reached their third position southeast of Cîrnățeni, where the division ran into resistance from the remnants of the German 306th Infantry Division. The fight lasted about an hour until these forces were destroyed. Taking advantage of this success, at 1330 hours General Lozanovich committed his 187th Guards Regiment from second echelon into the fighting in the direction of height 210.4. By 1800 hours the Regiment had reached the southern outskirts of Cîrnățeni where it engaged elements of the 15th Infantry Division's 100th Infantry Regiment, which had just arrived from Ursoaia. An hour later the 189th Regiment, in conjunction with the 187th and heavily supported by direct-fire artillery, attacked Cîrnățeni and captured this stronghold after a short but bitter fight. Following this the two regiments advanced to the eastern slopes of height 137.3, while the 181st Guards Regiment on the right outflanked Plop-Știubei from the southeast, cut off the German battalion defending it, and destroyed it by the end of the day.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, p. 236 Late in the day the German 6th Army brought up the 93rd Motorized Regiment and a battalion of tanks from the 13th Panzer Division (up to 35 tanks and assault guns) to the area from height 133.6 to Căușeni Hill in order to halt the further advance of 66th Corps with the help of the routed units of the 15th and 306th Divisions. In order to counter this increased resistance the 66th Corps released the 244th Rifle Division from second echelon. Overnight the Corps attempted to continue the offensive with special detachments but these were generally not successful. The next morning the 7th Mechanized Corps was tasked with entering the breach in the German defenses at 0600 hours while the 66th Corps was ordered to advance in the direction of Căușeni Hill and Opaci, outflanking Căușeni from the south, and by the end of the day to capture the line from Sălcuța to Tokuz. Following several attacks the 61st Guards captured height 138.6 but was unable to take Căușeni, which had been made into a powerful strongpoint with the addition of two regiments of the German 384th Infantry Division. In order to prepare for a deliberate assault the 181st Regiment secured the Corps' right flank along a line from Plop- Știubei to Cîrnățeni while the 187th and 189th Regiments took up positions on the approaches to Căușeni Vek from the south.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi- Kishinev Operation, pp. 236, 240-41. Note this source misnumbers the 189th Regiment as the 184th. With the German line breached by 37th Army, in the evening of August 21 the STAVKA issued Order No. 00442, assigning a mission of \\"beating off the enemy rearguards, throwing them back to the north and, by the close of 22 August... [to] capture the Sălcuța -- Taraclia -- Kenbaran -- Saka River area with the rifle formations.\\" The division launched a night attack which cleared the defenders out of Căușeni Vek and threw them back across the swampy flood plain of the Botna River in the direction of Zaim. Having pushed back the German forces from the Căușeni to Opaci to Manzyr line the Army's forces went over to the pursuit along its entire front, although German resistance increased somewhat later in the day. By the end of the day, owing to the 57th Army lagging behind, the 61st Guards was pulled back into reserve behind the Corps' right flank in the Sălcuța area. Overnight the Axis Chișinău grouping began falling back to the west as it was faced with encirclement. At 0400 hours on August 23 the 66th Corps was transferred to 57th Army, along with the 398th Guards Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment (mixed SU-152s and IS-2 heavy tanks)Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XII, Nafziger, 1998, pp. 42-43 and four artillery and mortar regiments, and was ordered to capture a line from Căinari to Gangura to Cărbuna to Sagaidac by the end of the day while a forward detachment occupied Răzeni.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 248-51, 253-54 On August 24 the 3rd and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts completed the encirclement of the Chișinău grouping, which made desperate efforts to break out over the following days. A favorable situation soon arose to split part of this force and the 66th and 9th Guards Rifle Corps converged on the village of Gura Galbenei from the east and north respectively and foiled a breakthrough attempt. By the end of August 27 the German 6th Army, which made up the bulk of the grouping, had been defeated and destroyed. 66th Corps now joined in the exploitation towards the Prut River and soon into Romania, which had left the Axis following a coup d'état on August 24.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 266, 275, 286, 143 By September 1 the 61st Guards and its 66th Corps had rejoined the 37th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 262 Into the Balkans In October the division was transferred to the 6th Guards Rifle Corps, still in 37th Army; it would remain under this Corps command for the duration of the war.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 322 By this time the Army was in the Yambol region of Bulgaria, which had also left the Axis. From there the Corps entrained for the Belgrade region of Yugoslavia where it unloaded on November 2 at the Pirot and Tservonarevka railroad stations and began a route march towards Paraćin. At 0800 hours on November 7 the Corps headquarters was attacked in error by bombers of the USAAF; the Corps commander, Lt. Gen. G. P. Kotov, was among the 30 men killed, and 38 more were wounded.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. & trans. D. M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, pp. 207-08 The 37th Army was soon reassigned as an occupation force for the southern Balkans and the 6th Guards Corps, now consisting of the 20th and 61st Guards Rifle and 10th Guards Airborne Divisions, was transferred on November 12 to the 57th Army, where it would remain for the duration.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 352Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", pp. 69-70 Two days later General Lozanovich was relieved of his command of the division for \\"the loss of command of the units, lack of control, ignorance of the situation, and the loss of material artillery\\". He was replaced by Col. Pyotr Ivanovich Kasatkin on November 15. In addition to 6th Guards Corps the 57th Army also received the 9th Breakthrough Artillery Division from 37th Army.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, p. 198 Hungarian Operations At this time 57th Army was the only army available to 3rd Ukrainian Front to force a crossing of the Danube in preparation for a drive on Budapest. The most favorable sectors were in the Mohács and Batina areas, but at both the river was from 250m - 800m wide and the east bank was dominated by heights on the west bank. The Army was also facing shortages of crossing equipment. The initial crossings were to be made by the 64th and 75th Rifle Corps with the 6th Guards Corps in reserve to develop the offensive in the direction of Pécs and Oroszló. When the crossing operations began on November 9 the Corps, still in 37th Army, was in the Belgrade area, with the 61st Guards located at Grocka. On November 15 the Front commander, Marshal F. I. Tolbukhin, ordered that no later than November 22 the 6th Guards Corps was to be concentrated on west bank of the Danube to develop the offensive by November 26 to the northwest. At this time the Corps was still moving up to the crossing areas, with 10th Guards Airborne in the lead. By the end of November 18 the 61st Guards had passed through Zmajevo. In further orders on November 22 Tolbukhin directed the Corps to cross to the west bank overnight to secure the right flank of the bridgehead in preparation for the 4th Guards Army entering it four days later. By the end of November 24 the 61st Guards was at the crossing point at Batina.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, pp. 200-02, 204, 209, 213-15 On November 28 the Axis forces, attempting to disrupt the advance of the 32nd Guards Mechanized Brigade and elements of 6th Guards Corps in the direction of Pécs, staged several counterattacks towards Máriakéménd but these were successfully repulsed. By the following day Axis resistance was largely crushed and by day's end the combined Soviet force had taken Pécs while the 6th Guards Corps continued to the outskirts of Pogány. Over 20 days of fighting the Front had won an operational bridgehead over the Danube and created an opportunity for an offensive on Budapest as well as towards Nagykanizsa. On November 30 the Front gained up to 28km, and as much as 26km the following day. As the advance continued, on December 4 Tolbukhin demanded that the main forces of 6th Guards Corps be shifted to the north of Nagybajom. Two days later the 57th Army was encountering increasing resistance as the Axis forces regrouped to try to hold the oilfields near Nagykanizsa.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, pp. 219, 221, 223-26 Over the following days this resistance continued to intensify and during December 8 the 57th Army repulsed 23 counterattacks while engaged in heavy defensive fighting against infantry and tanks; 6th Guards Corps was holding a line in the area of Marcali and Nagyszakácsi. At this point the Army was facing the Hungarian \\"Saint Laszlo\\" Division and 3rd Cavalry Brigade, as well as the German Brandenburg Division and 13th SS Mountain Division Handschar. The Corps continued to consolidate its lines over the next two weeks while the 46th and 4th Guards Armies prepared for a new drive on December 20 to penetrate the \\"Margarita Line\\" and continue the advance on Budapest. 57th Army was ordered to remain on the defensive in order to cover the flank of this drive. By now the Corps had lost the 10th Guards Airborne, being replaced by the 19th and 113th Rifle Divisions.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, pp. 227-30, 243, 251-52 Budapest was surrounded by December 26 and on January 1, 1945 the German Army Group South began relief operations which continued for most of the month. During one of the most crucial of these on January 20 the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf and 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking regrouped and then carried out a nighttime reconnaissance-in-force between the Danube and Lake Velence. This was followed at 0500 hours on January 21 by an assault that focused on the positions held by the 5th Guards Cavalry Corps, but a secondary thrust by up to a battalion of infantry backed by 17 tanks struck the 61st Guards in the direction of the Sárvíz River with the aim of tying down the 57th Army and preventing it being shifted to the Budapest axis. The attack broke into the division's first line of trenches but made little further progress due to strong antitank defenses.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, p. 309 By the beginning of February the 6th Guards Corps once again had the 61st and 20th Guards and 10th Guards Airborne divisions under command.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 59 During Operation Spring Awakening, which began on March 6, the 2nd Panzer Army made little progress against 57th Army before the Soviet forces went over to the counterattack. On March 22 Colonel Kasatkin was replaced in command of the division by Col. Sergei Nikolaevich Lisenkov. Beginning on March 26 the 57th Army made the main offensive drive in the Nagykanizsa–Körmend Offensive, which continued until April 15. In the process, on March 30 elements of the division took part in the recapture of the town of Marcali and this was recognized in Moscow with a salute of 20 artillery salvoes from 224 guns.http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/4-hungary.html.

His widowed mother raised her two boys in a disadvantaged area of Plymouth. His elder brother, William, attended the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth at no cost as a naval orphan. David followed in 1925, becoming known as \\"Little Willie,\\" a nickname that followed him as \\"Willie\\" throughout his life. \\"Obituary\\", The Independent, 7 January 2013 Naval career Illness delayed completion of his education at Dartmouth, but in 1929 he eventually joined the battleship HMS Barham (04) as a cadet. In 1930, he was assigned to the cruiser HMS Berwick (65) serving on the China Station, where he became interested in the Chinese Junk. Returning to Home waters, he was promoted to lieutenant in 1934 in HMS Achilles (70). In 1935, he commenced training as a Fleet Air Arm pilot. Upon completion of his training, he became adjutant of 824 Naval Air Squadron. He returned to the Far East in the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle. During this period, he resumed his study of the Chinese Junk and published several papers on the subject as well as commissioned a local carpenter at Weihaiwei to make scale models. In 1936, the Admiralty Awdred Waters the Admiralty Gold Medal for Naval History. In 1939, he donated two of these models to the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. In 1940, he became a flying instructor in the Fairey Swordfish aircraft, based at Toulon, where he was also involved in bombing raids on the Italian coast. The German occupation of France in June forced Waters to evacuate to Algeria and then Malta, where he flew with 830 Naval Air Squadron. Flying from Malta on the night of 13-14 August 1940, he was making a low-level torpedo attack on German shipping at Augusta, Sicily, when he became disoriented after flares went out and crashed his \\"Stringbag\\" aircraft into the harbour. Rescued by Italians, he was made a prisoner of war, along with Michael D. Kyrle-Pope, at Poveglia Island, near Venice. With Kyrle- Pope and several others, waters escaped. Caught on a rooftop, where they were planning to steal a boat to take to Yugoslavia, they were taken prisoner and marched to Sulmona, then shipped to Marlag O, the German prisoner of war camp for officers and men of the British and Canadian naval and merchant navies. While in the latter camp from 1942 to 1945, Waters was promoted to lieutenant- commander using books supplied by the Red Cross to teach history. After the war, he remained in the Royal Navy on flying duty. In 1946, he contemplated doing further study in history and obtained an offer from Balliol College, Oxford, but the Navy declined to send him. Later that year, he was posted to the Admiralty's Naval Historical Branch to assist in writing staff histories of the war. Civil service career David Waters retired from active service in the Roal Navy in 1950 and entered the Civil Service to work in the Historial Branch as a specialist in the defence of shipping. Here, he began studies on the general history of Naval convoy from the age of sail to the Second World War and became the principal author for a 1957 staff history on the Second World War, \\"Defeat of the Enemy Attack upon Shipping,\\" a classified volume that was eventually published thirty years later in 1997. Through a friendship that he developed with the wealthy American sportsman, former wartime naval officer, and book collector, Henry C. Taylor, Waters began his studies of the history of navigation. He published \\"The Rutters of the Sea\\" in 1967 and the \\"Art of Navigation in England and Elizabethan and Early Stuart Times\\" in 1958, books that Taylor had instigated as well as financially supported, even providing school fees for Waters's new family after David married his brother William's widow, Hope, in 1946.John S. Kebabian, The Henry C. Taylor Collection (New Haven: Yale University Library, 1971), p. viii. In 1960, Waters became head of Navigation and Astronomy at the National Maritime Museum. There, he played an important role in converting the Old Royal Observatory, Greenwich into a museum in 1967. He served as secretary of the National Maritime Museum from 1968 to 1971 and then became Deputy Director from 1971 to 1978. Retiring from the civil Service in 1978 at the age of 67, he held two visiting professorships, a Caird Fellowship at the National Maritime Museum, and a fellowship at the John Carter Brown Library.

Her science based education and fluency in the German language paved the way for her later acceptance in an integration program. Partnered companies (ARCO, Shell, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil) would pay for the participants' undergraduate education and in the summers the students would work in oil fields or uranium exploration sites. She earned her Bachelor's degree from Virginia State University and her Master's degree in economic geology from University of Washington. While working on her Master's degree, Maine-Jackson found herself working at Mount Baker, only 300 miles north of Mount St. Helens when it erupted in 1980.  Career  Maine-Jackson started her career as an exploration geologist specializing in uranium mining in the Rockies for the Atlantic Richfield Oil Company. In the 1980s, she worked on drill rigs, including at the Hanford Site, where she studied the flow of groundwater toward storage sites of radioactive hazardous waste and analyzed the core samples that were drilled out. She has worked for the Washington Department of Ecology Nuclear Waste Program on decontaminating the Hanford Site for over twenty years. Maine-Jackson currently serves on the Board of Earth Sciences and Resources for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Division on Earth and Life Studies.  Advocacy and Leadership Positions  Maine-Jackson is a trustee at The Nature Conservancy in South Carolina, where she works to protect loggerhead sea turtles and wildlife in the ACE Basin. She served on the State of Washington African American Affairs Commission during four governors, as chairperson of the City of Kennewick Diversity Commission, as a two-term appointee to the Washington State Community Economic Revitalization Board, and an advisory member to the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. She is a founding member of the National Association of Black Geoscientists. She has also served as an advocate for communities damaged by the environmental impacts of nuclear waste.

A Harvard graduate, he worked in private practice in Hawaii before being chosen as one of the first faculty members of the University of Chicago Law School in 1904. Bigelow remained at Chicago for forty years and rose to become dean of the law school. He wrote a number of textbooks and advised the American Law Institute. After retirement he became a member of the National Loyalty Review Board, established by Harry S. Truman to vet federal employees. In his private life Bigelow had collections of African and Japanese art and was an avid big game hunter, in the course of which he became one of the first white men to cross the Belgian Congo west of Lake Edward.  Early life  Harry Augustus Bigelow was born in Norwood, Massachusetts, on September 22, 1874. He graduated from Harvard College in 1896 and was awarded a degree from the Harvard Law School in 1899. Bigelow afterwards worked as a clerk in a conveyancing office in Boston and, for one semester, as a part-time lecturer on criminal law at Harvard. From 1900 to 1903 he practiced law in Honolulu, Hawaii, and was a junior member of the Hawaii State Bar Association.  Chicago  The University of Chicago founded its law school in 1902, and in 1904 Bigelow was asked to join as a faculty member by university president William Rainey Harper. Bigelow had been selected by the acting dean Joseph Henry Beale. Bigelow was a keen proponent of the case method of teaching but recognized its limitations in some fields of law. He was promoted to professor in 1908. He specialized in property law and advised the American Law Institute (ALI) in this field. Bigelow published the casebooks The Law of Personal Property and The Law of Rights in Land, which became standard texts in many American law schools. He also published a textbook, Introduction to the Law of Real Property, for students of land law. Bigelow was a contributor to the ALI publications Restatement of the Conflict of Laws, Restatement of the Law of Torts, and Restatement of the Law of Property and was a reporter for the latter until 1929. In 1929 Bigelow was appointed dean of the University of Chicago Law School and the first John P. Wilson Professor of Law. As dean, he recognized that the effective practice of law required a broader subject knowledge and expanded teaching at the school to include classes in accounting, economics, and psychology. Bigelow was appointed a trustee in bankruptcy for the complicated proceedings of the Chicago-based Insull Utilities Investment Inc. in 1933. Bigelow reached the university's mandatory retirement age in 1939 and ceased to be dean. He was appointed an emeritus professor and continued to take classes in law, property, and future interests for the next five years. In 1947 he was drafted onto the National Loyalty Review Board by President Harry S. Truman. This body was established by Executive Order 9835 during the Second Red Scare to screen federal employees for \\"loyalty\\", with particular regard to avoiding any Communist sympathies. Bigelow served on the body during his final years, in spite of failing health.  Private life  While living in Hawaii in 1902, Bigelow married Mary Parker; the couple had no children and she died in 1920. Bigelow had an interest in art, particularly African and Japanese, and had a particularly notable collection of Japanese prints. He was also interested in motoring, golf, overseas travel, big-game hunting, the study of other cultures, and exploration of remote areas. Bigelow accompanied Herbert E. Bradley and his wife, Mary Hastings Bradley, on their African big-game-hunting expeditions of 1924 and 1925. By doing so, he became one of the first white people to cross the unexplored Belgian Congo west of Lake Edward. Bigelow was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Order of the Coif. Bigelow died of heart failure in Chicago on January 8, 1950. He left a substantial bequest to the University of Chicago, which allowed it to found a professorship in his name.

She is a niece of President Donald J. Trump. Her 2020 book about him and the family, Too Much and Never Enough, sold nearly one million copies on the day of its release. Early life and education Mary Lea Trump was born in May 1965 to flight attendant Linda Lee Clapp and Fred Trump Jr., a commercial jet pilot with Trans World Airlines. Her older brother is Frederick Trump III. Trump graduated from the Ethel Walker School in 1983. She studied English literature at Tufts University, earned a master's degree in English literature at Columbia University, for which she studied the works of William Faulkner and his dysfunctional fictional Compson family, and holds a PhD in clinical psychology from the Derner Institute of Advanced Psychological Studies at Adelphi University. Career Trump worked for one year at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center while working on her PhD research. Trump is a contributor to the book Diagnosis: Schizophrenia, published by Columbia University Press in 2002. She has taught graduate courses in developmental psychology, trauma, and psychopathology. She is the founder and chief executive officer of The Trump Coaching Group, a life coaching company, and has also owned and operated a number of small businesses in the Northeast. Too Much and Never Enough Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man is a tell-all book written by Trump published on July 14, 2020, by Simon & Schuster. According to Trump's note at the beginning of the book, all accounts in the book come either from her own memory or from recorded conversations with family, friends and others. Other sources are legal, financial and family documents and email correspondence as well as the New York Times investigative article done by David Barstow, Susanne Craig, and Russ Buettner. The book details how the author was the anonymous source who revealed Trump family tax returns to The New York Times; the reporting won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize. A legal battle over whether the book could be published was waged in New York's judicial system, with an appellate judge allowing Simon & Schuster to publish the book. The book sold close to one million copies on its first day of sales. Personal life Trump's father died on September 29, 1981 at the age of 42 from a heart attack caused by alcoholism; she was sixteen. He had developed an enlarged heart and had undergone surgical procedures before he finally succumbed to the disease and died alone in Queens Hospital Center in Jamaica Hills. Trump was at school, watching a film in the auditorium with other kids when a school teacher pulled her aside and made her call home. She found out after a series of phone calls that her father had died. Mary was not able to see her father's body despite her request to do so and had to be content with saying her goodbye to a closed coffin at the funeral. In her book, Trump relates a time when her grandmother Mary Anne MacLeod Trump referred to Elton John as a \\"faggot\\", and Trump decided not to come out as gay and tell her that she was going to marry a woman, with whom she would later raise a daughter. She has since divorced, and lives on Long Island, New York, with her daughter. Trump's brother, Fred III, is nicknamed \\"Fritz\\" and his wife is named Lisa. Politics Trump supported Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. On July 15, 2020, she said in an ABC News interview conducted by George Stephanopoulos that Donald Trump should resign. Mary said that he is \\"utterly incapable of leading this country, and it's dangerous to allow him to do so.\\" In a July 22, 2020 interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, when asked for her professional opinions, Mary stated that Donald Trump exhibits sociopathic tendencies but not at a high-functioning level like his father, was institutionally insulated from responsibilities, and is never held accountable for his actions. Conflicts within the Trump family When Fred Trump Sr. died in 1999 from Alzheimer's disease, Mary and her brother Fred III contested their grandfather's will. Fred Sr.'s will left the bulk of his estate, in equal shares, to his children. His grandchildren were each left $200,000. When Mary's father predeceased him, Fred Sr.'s lawyers had recommended amending his will, to leave Mary and her brother, Fred III, larger shares than the grandchildren with living parents. They anticipated Fred Sr.'s will would be challenged if it were not amended by descendants who would argue his intent was that each child would eventually leave a portion of his or her share of the estate to his or her own descendants. Shortly after Fred Sr.'s death, Mary's sister-in-law gave birth to a son with a rare and debilitating medical condition—one that would require a lifetime of very expensive medical care. Fred Sr. had established a foundation that paid the medical expenses of his family. After Mary and Fred III had filed suit against Donald Trump and two of his three living siblings, Mary and Fred III were advised that the medical foundation would no longer pay for their medical expenses. The lawsuit was settled in 2001. The final settlement of the dispute over sharing Fred Sr.'s estate did not award them the share their father would have inherited, if he had been alive when Fred Sr. died. It did restore coverage of their family's medical expenses. The 2019 Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting was awarded to David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner of The New York Times for \\"an exhaustive 18-month investigation of Donald Trump's finances that debunked his statements of self-made wealth and revealed a business empire riddled with tax dodges.\\" Mary was reportedly a key source of information for that study, having come into possession of Donald's tax documents during the discovery process in the dispute over her grandfather's estate. Upon the announcement of Mary's book Too Much and Never Enough in June 2020, her uncle Robert Trump attempted to block its release, stating that she signed a non-disclosure agreement during the 1999 lawsuit. The filing of a temporary restraining order against Mary was dismissed by a New York court for a lack of jurisdiction, and the book was published on July 14, 2020.

The Bandidos had moved their headquarters from Oslo to Drammen the previous year.En drept i bombeeksplosjon Aftenposten (5 June 1997) The bombing was ordered by Torkjell Alsaker, president of the Hells Angels in Norway, and was carried out by members of the Screwdrivers Motorcycle Club, an affiliated gang who were granted full membership to the Hells Angels as a result of the attack.Slik sprengte de Drammen Verdens Gang (17 November 2001) Bombing Between thirty and fifty kilograms of explosives, made from a mixture of diesel and synthetic fertilizer, and a homemade fuse were placed inside a Volkswagen Transporter 1981 model by John Gerhard Berg, a member of the Screwdrivers Motorcycle Club. Berg later told police during a police interview that he was given the assignment by the Hells Angels president Torkjell Alsaker. The day before the attack, Berg drove the van from Hamar to Drammen along a road where there were no surveillance cameras. On the night on 4 June 1997, Berg dressed in a black wig and other clothes he could dispose of, and drove the van into the entranceway of the Bandidos' Drammen clubhouse located at Konnerudgata 27 before lighting the bomb's fuse. He then used a bicycle that was attached to the van to flee the scene. Kai Mosether served as a getaway driver for Berg and drove him from the city. The explosives detonated at 11:44pm. The explosion was more powerful than planned, possibly because too little gravel was used over the explosive.Skrekk-natten Verdens Gang (25 April 2002) Shock waves could be felt 500-600 meters away from the explosion site, severely damaging nearby buildings, including the Drammens Is factory. After the initial explosion, the clubhouse re-ignited twice before the entire building collapsed in a major fire.«Kripos frykter Bandidos-hevn» Arnseth Sætran, Aftenposten (5 June 1997) Three people inside the building survived. Irene Astrid Bækkevold, a fifty-one-year-old woman who was driving past the scene in her car, was killed in the bombingExplosion destroys motorcycle gang headquarters in Norway Doug Mellgren, Associated Press (June 5, 1997) and a total of twenty-two people were transported to hospital. Bækkevold's husband, who was a passenger in her vehicle, was among the wounded. At Drammen Hospital, a full emergency alert was announced and disaster preparedness was established, the first time such measures had been necessary at the hospital. Aftermath Prime Minister of Norway Thorbjørn Jagland and Justice Minister Gerd-Liv Valla attended the scene of the bombing the following day. Jagland vowed to propose legislation banning motorcycle gangs from establishing clubhouses in populated areas. Irene Bækkevold became the tenth person and the second innocent bystander to be killed as a result of the biker war. The resulting backlash from the public and increasing scrutiny on motorcycle gangs from law enforcement were among the factors that led to the end of the war, which officially ceased when the Bandidos and Hells Angels reached a truce in September 1997.The Mammoth Book of Bikers Arthur Veno (2007) Litigation=District Court The investigation into the bombing took four-and-a-half years to complete and seven people affiliated with the Hells Angels were indicted for the attack. At Drammen District Court on 10 June 2002, John Gerhard Berg was sentenced to ten years in prison for arson and serious damage, while Torkjell Alsaker was acquitted. Two others, including Kai Mosether, were also found guilty of both arson, the other also for serious damage, and were sentenced to five and eight years in prison respectively. Mosether received the greatest penalty rebate after confessing and assisting with investigation and clarification. Three others were acquitted of arson, but sentenced to three years in prison each for serious damage. Although Alsaker was acquitted, the court found it likely that he had ordered the bombing. He was thus held jointly liable for the financial compensation as the other convicted persons. The six convicted were ordered to pay kr120,000 in compensation to the widower of Irene Bækkevold. The prosecutor had requested sentences ranging between seven to twelve years in prison, sixteen years for Alsaker, and the entire amount of damages was kr290 million.HA-leder ble frikjent Hans O. Torgesen and Arild M. Jonasse, Aftenposten (11 June 2002) All seven were jointly fined kr13.6 million in damages. This was equivalent to around five per cent of the actual economic damage to the environment. Insurance companies and the police had already seized assets, property, boats and cars for kr5.5 million, mostly in the name of Alsaker's cohabitant. Five of the six convicted appealed the case to the court of appeal. Mosether accepted the verdict.«Rotta»-anke avgjøres fredag Arild M.

The brand generated controversy for its use of Nazi-style imagery.  Design  The beer uses a brown label, which media reports alleged to be a reference to the Sturmabteilung (SA, also known as Brownshirts). The logo comprises a Reichsadler eagle and Iron Cross with the name of the beer below it in Gothic script.  History  The beer was originally offered for sale on Neo-Nazi websites in January 2020. Frenck said that he came up with the idea after the police enforced an alcohol ban at a neo-Nazi festival at Vessra Abbey. In the same year, the beer was sold in a liquor store in the town of Bad Bibra, Saxony-Anhalt, where it sold out. This activity was discovered by the District Chief, Götz Ulrich, on Holocaust Memorial Day. The beer was being sold at €18.88 a case, which was understood to be Neo-Nazi code with \\"18\\" standing for \\"AH\\" (Adolf Hitler) and \\"88\\" standing for \\"Heil Hitler.\\" The police were called to investigate because of this Nazi-style imagery. Since the symbols used on the beer label are not banned under the Strafgesetzbuch section 86a and no swastikas appeared, the police ruled that the product was not illegal. The liquor store was an independent franchisee of Getränke-Quelle, which ordered the shop not to sell any more and terminated their franchise agreement. Frenck had been selling Deutsches Reichsbräu at his own pub in the meantime. The Scottish brewer BrewDog responded to this incident by creating an advert posted on a trailer parked outside Frenck's pub, which proclaimed, \\"Wenn du nur eine Hautfarbe magst, kannst Du mit mehr als 30 Sorten eh nichts anfangen\\" (\\"If you only like one skin colour, you can't do anything with more than 30 varieties anyway\\").

Kate Quinn has been executive director of CEASE since 2011. In the early 1990s, the City of Edmonton formed an organization named Communities for Controlled Prostitution, which was later renamed Communities for Changing Prostitution.

Career  Paul Luchtenberg attended school in Gummersbach. He graduated in 1912 and went on to study philosophy and education at the University of Bonn and the University of Münster. During his studies he was a member of AMV Makaria Bonn, a student music society.Verband Alter SVer (VASV): Anschriftenbuch und Vademecum. Ludwigshafen am Rhein 1959, S. 81. After completing a PhD in Philosophy under Erich Becher, he began a probation year, teaching in a grammar school. He went on to teach in Remscheid until 1923. In addition, he qualified to be a professor at the University of Cologne in 1920, where he was a student of Max Scheler, whose material value-ethics he wanted to apply in his teaching. He assumed his first professorship in 1923 at the College of Economics and Political Science in Detmold. Between 1925 and 1931 he was initially an associate professor, and later a full professor, of education, philosophy and psychology at the Technical University of Darmstadt. From 1931 he was an associate professor of the same subjects at the Technical University of Dresden, where he also led the Pedagogical Institute for Teacher Training. By 1933, he was already a target for attacks by the National Socialist German Students’ League due to being a democrat. In 1936 he was dismissed, (later than many others including Victor Klemperer and Richard Seyfert) in implementation of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, after long being protected by the Culture Minister for Saxony, Wilhelm Hartnecke.  Politics  Until 1945, Luchtenberg did not belong to any party.Paul Luchtenberg: Wandlung und Auftrag liberaler Kulturpolitik. Bonn o. J. (1960), S. 6 f. After the war, he was a co-founder of the FDP North Rhine-Westphalia. In addition, he was a member of the FDP federal executive committee from 1951 to 1958. Luchtenberg was a member of the German Bundestag from October 30, 1950, when he succeeded Friedrich Middelhauve as FDP state chairman, until the end of the first legislative period. He was a member of the Bundestag again from September 18, 1954, when he succeeded Willi Weyer as Interior Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, until April 9, 1956. In 1956 the FDP switched coalition partners from the CDU to the SPD, which, at the federal level, led to the \\"ministerial wing\\" splitting from the party and founding the Free People's Party (FVP). After this, Luchtenberg served as Minister of Culture from February 28, 1956 to July 1958. As state minister of culture, Luchtenberg advocated the creation of a \\"Federal Ministry of Culture\\" in order to break up the very denominational cultural policy of the states of Bavaria and Rhineland-Palatinate in particular. Thus the Minister of Culture of Rhineland-Palatinate, Adolf Süsterhenn, was one of the harshest critics of these plans, while the Minister of Hesse, Arno Hennig, supported them.  Charity work  Luchtenberg was president of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation from 1961 up to 1970, after being vice president since 1958. From 1970 until his day of death, Luchtenberg was a honorary chairman of the foundation. In 1962, he founded the Paul Luchtenberg Foundation to support the culture of his hometown Burscheid. The House of Art in Burscheid is another example of his charity work. Documents about Luchtenberg's work for the Friedrich Naumann Foundation can be found in the Archive of Liberalism in Gummersbach.

Matsubara had some good seasons for the Hawks: in 1973 his 2.87 ERA was good for eighth-best in the Pacific League. He pitched in that year's Japan Series, taking the loss in one game against his old team the Giants. Matsubara's 3.04 ERA in 1974 was tied for eighth-best in the Pacific League.

Southern European Australian people can usually trace back full or partial heritage to Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and other countries within Mediterranean Europe, or otherwise ethnoculturally related to the area. Along with Eastern European Australians and Northwestern European Australians, they are one of several subgroupings of European Australians. Background South or Southern European Australians have been widely research in academia and referenced in various scholarly and journalistic works as a distinct pan- ethnic grouping within Australia. The group can be divided into nation-based subgroupings, such as Portuguese Australians and Italian Australians. History Dr Andonis Piperoglou has written how some of the earliest Southern Europeans arrived in Australia around 1902. In an Australian Journal of Politics and History, the article outlined how Greek immigrants established themselves in the oyster industry of New South Wales. During the 1920s, as immigration from Mediterranean Europe grew, there were accusations from Anglo- Celtic Australians, including the Australian Workers' Union, that the group were arriving in unmanageably large numbers. There were also complaints that the new workers were competing in labour industries, such as the sugar cane industry in Queensland. Negative stereotypes and depictions in media of the group persisted in this period, often relating to hygiene and eating habits. During the 1930s, Griffith University's Robert Mason has proposed that the pan-ethnic group were significantly involved with anarchism in Australia, producing leaders in the movement with Italian and Spanish heritages. Actions and attitudes towards Southern Europeans (along with, at times, Irish Australians) in this period has been compared with the historically poor treatment of Poles and Italians in Germany. In the 1940s, there continued to be resistance to the recruitment of the group as a labour force. However, due to lack of interest from Australia's preferred immigrant groups, namely British people and other groups from Northwestern Europe, by the 1950s, South Europeans were the country's main source of workers. In the early 1960s, Dr Charles A. Price's various Southern Europeans in Australia publications became established studies of the pan-ethnic grouping in relation to migration and integration. Price's works primarily relied upon Australia's naturalisation records. During the 1950s and 1960s, there was significant migratory flow into the country by Eastern Europeans and Southern European people. In this period, discriminatory attitudes against the newcomers by the native-born Australians have been compared with some Northwestern European Americans' prejudice toward Southern European Americans, and the enactment of the National Origins Formula of the 1920s in the United States. South Europeans in Australia, however, appeared to progress \\"through the ethnic pecking order faster\\" than their American counterparts had. Towards the end of the 1960s, it had become harder to attract significant numbers of the group to Australia, and some were returning home to Southern Europe. Rules on family reunion were relaxed as a countermeasure and recruitment attempts increased in the region. Published in the Mediterranean Journal of Educational Studies in 1998, Dr Yiannis Dimitreas proposed that the group had remained only partially integrated up until the 1990s, and manifested cultural elements of their ancestral nations in Australia: > This means that until the present period of the 1990s, the experiences of > Southern Europeans in Australia was the experience of a Southern European > microcosm with different national origins in the context of one single > nation state, namely Australia. Their efforts towards the creation of > Mediterranean space has been both a real and imaginary reflection of the > social tensions, political conflict and economic antagonism found within > single nation states of their European homeland prior to and after their > migration and settlement in Australia. In 2005, MP Tony Abbott wrote how \\"Fifty years ago, some Anglo-Australians mistrusted southern European Australians\\", as a historical context to intolerance in the country, in relation to the debate surrounding a possible burka ban in Australia. Academic research 1993 research, published in Population and Development Review, studied the reproductive behaviours and fertility of the group in Australia. Research published in 1999 demonstrated that first-generation Southern Europeans retained higher marriage rates than native-born Australians. 2001 research into Australians youths, published in the Asian Journal of Social Psychology, showed that, while Southern European Australians were considered a minority group, they were (along with the \\"majority cultural group\\" of Anglo-Celtic Australians) more likely to be in a relationship than Chinese Australians. In 2005, research conducted by sociologist Katharine Betts showed that Southern European immigrants were more likely to favour immigration from their birth-nation (ie. Spanish Australians advocating for further immigration of Spaniards into Australia), than they were to endorse immigration from Asia. A 2004 study published in Diabetes Care journal, compared Australian-born and Southern European-born Australians' risk of diabetes, using, among many factors, body mass index. A study of the Mediterranean diet, in relation to heart disease and colonic cancer, compared intragroup eating behaviours, with elderly Greek Australians living in Melbourne compared with Southern European Australians (Greeks, Italians, and others) aged 25-65. The results found that the pan-ethnic group consumed more pork, shellfish, meat in general, eggs, soft drinks and alcohol, and less chicken, organ meat, fish, stone fruit, bananas.

On the morning of December 29, he was eating Tim Tam biscuits in his cell when guards ordered him to stop due to his diabetes. After he refused or ignored the orders to stop multiple correctional officers entered his cell, restrained him and moved him to another cell where he was injected with the sedative midazolam. Dungay stopped breathing shortly after and was declared dead at 3:42pm. The inquest into Dungay's death began on 16 July 2018. At the inquest, camera footage showed that he was held down and yelled \\"I can't breathe\\" multiple times.

Ruth Peak is the third-highest peak in the Bailey Range, which is a subrange of the Olympic Mountains. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Carrie, to the northwest, and Mount Fairchild is set to the north. In clear weather, the mountain can be seen from the visitor center at Hurricane Ridge. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Hoh and Elwha Rivers. The first ascent of this peak was made in 1961 by Bert Brown, Roy Etten, and Victor Nelson. Climate Ruth Peak in winter Based on the Köppen climate classification, Ruth Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. This climate supports the Fairchild Glacier on its northeastern slope. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for viewing and climbing are July through September. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

He is the founding director of the Center for Cell Engineering and the head of the Gene Transfer and Gene Expression Laboratory. He is a member of the department of medicine at Memorial Hospital and of the immunology program at the Sloan Kettering Institute. He is best known for his major contributions to T cell engineering and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, an immunotherapy based on the genetic engineering of a patient's own T cells to treat cancer.  Education and Career  Sadelain was born in France, where he earned his M.D. at the University of Paris, France, in 1984. After obtaining his Ph.D. in immunology at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, in 1989, he trained as a postdoctoral fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While at MIT, Sadelain began his research on genetic engineering. In 1994, Sadelain joined Memorial Sloan Kettering as an assistant member in the Sloan Kettering Institute, where he established programs on human hematopoietic stem cell and T cell engineering. In 2008, at the bequest of then-Memorial Sloan Kettering President Harold Varmus and Sloan Kettering Institute Director Thomas Kelly, he founded the Center for Cell Engineering at Memorial Sloan Kettering. He is a past president of the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy (2014–2015) and previously served on its board of directors from 2004 to 2007. He served as a member of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) of the NIH from 2013 to 2015.  Research  In his lab at the Sloan Kettering Institute, Sadelain and his team study gene transfer in hematopoietic stem cells and T cells, the regulation of transgene expression, the biology of chimeric antigen receptors, and therapeutic strategies to enhance immunity against cancer. Sadelain is a recognized leader in the concept and design of synthetic receptors for antigen, which he named chimeric antigen receptors and classified into first and second generation. The design of second generation CARs, which are endowed with both activating and costimulatory properties, REF Maher is integral to the success of CAR therapies. In 2003, Sadelain's lab identified CD19 as an effective target for CAR therapy in mice. Following the establishment of clinical CAR T cell manufacturing by Dr. Isabelle Rivière at MSK, Sadelain's team was the first to report on molecular complete responses induced by CD19 CAR T cells in adults with relapsed, refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The MSK team received FDA breakthrough designation for this treatment in 2014. The US FDA approved the first CAR therapies, targeting CD19 with second generations CARs, in 2017. Sadelain also devised the how to design lentivciral vectors encoding the ß-globin gene for the treatment of severe hemoglobinopathies, which includeing ß-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. The MSK team was the first to treat patients with ß-thalassemia in the US. Sadelain's ongoing research at MSK and SKI continues to explore “synthetic immunity,”, further improving the design, development, and clinical translation of cell-based immunotherapies. CAR T cells have become known as “living drugs,” a term he coined to describe immune cells genetically endowed with supraphysiological properties. Sadelain's current research makes large ample use of genome editing, which he showed enhances CAR T cells when the CAR is expressed from the TRAC locus. Sadelain's research on “off-the-shelf” CAR T cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is now being developed by Fate Therapeutics. His research with Dr. Prasad S. Adusumilli led to a collaboration with Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. for a product candidate to treat malignant mesothelioma using mesothelin- targeted CAR T cells named icasM28z. In 2013, Sadelain co-founded Juno Therapeutics Inc.  Patents  Sadelain holds 13 patents in immunotherapy. Sadelain is named on patent U.S. Patent No. 10,370,452 covering compositions and uses of effector T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), where such T cells are derived from a pluripotent stem cell including an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC).

Life  He has taught fine art at Ohio Wesleyan University, the Alberta College of Art and Design, and the University of Calgary (1971-1998) (since 1998, he has been Professor Emeritus of the Department of Art). Currently, he is based in West Kelowna, BC  Career  Throughout his career, Hall has focused on painstakingly accurate still-life paintings of everyday objects. He has said in the past that he chooses the objects both for their symbolism and for their formal relationships. In 2016, curator Liz Wylie suggested that he is moved and inspired by the effects of light on objects. In 1969, he taught at Ohio Wesleyan University and while there travelled to nearby American museums and New York to see American Pop art of the 1960s. As Wylie points out, such art had a huge role in allowing artists to pursue representational painting, especially in the face of the dominant art forms in their ascendancies at the same time – Minimalism and the various forms of conceptual art. Hall felt confirmed by American New Realist painters in his choice of still-life subject, though what he painted varied. He choose grungy subject matter and painted on a huge scale. The result was fascinating and unique. Nuclear Fever (1994), acrylic on canvas While in Ohio, Hall created a gigantic Garbage triptych measuring six metres long, which is now in the collection of the Nickle Galleries at the University of Calgary. He continued to paint this series when he moved back to Canada to Calgary, though over time, varied his practice to encompass new themes. He spent a year painting in New York in 1979/80, the same time that he painted his canvas Harry (1980) and was given a touring one-person show by the National Gallery of Canada. In the 1980s, Hall created his Tourist Series and his Toys series, followed by his Still-Life Portrait series, begun in 1984. These last works were featured in a one-person touring show organized by the Agnes Etherington Art Centre at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1989. Mixed in between all these series were his Mexican-themed paintings, done during his annual six-month stays there between 1988 and 1999, which culminated in a retrospective exhibition at Mexico’s City’s Museo de Arte Moderno in 1994. In the 1990s Hall began to exploit the information and results possible by using digital photography and Adobe Photoshop. Since moving to West Kelowna in 1999, Hall has completed several series of work, many of domestic still-life subjects such as tea cups and food, followed by a series on vegetables and fruit. Hall has also participated in group exhibitions in Canada, the United States, Great Britain, Europe and Japan.He has received commissions from Calgary’s Foothills Hospital, the Royal Bank and Cineplex Odeon. Hall was also perhaps the first artist in Canada to publish a selection of his work on a CD- ROM. In 2009, Hall and Calgary-based artist Alexandra Haeseker, a long-time collaborator and colleague of Hall’s, showed together in Pendulum/ Pendula. The exhibition consisted of collaborative realistic paintings which both had done in Canada and Mexico from 1992 to 1998. Each painted half of the canvas. These paintings were seen in many public galleries – four in Mexico and four in BC. Chambers (2020), acrylic on canvas In 2016, the Kelowna Art Gallery organized John Hall: Travelling Light: A forty-five-year survey of paintings curated by Liz Wylie. The exhibition traveled to the Nickle Art Museum at the University of Calgary in 2017. It was accompanied by a book, published by Black Dog Publishing in the United Kingdom, which included colour reproductions of all of the works in the show and also texts by Wylie and by Alexandra Haeseker. In 2016, he began the series he called Framed. In 2020, he based the composition and some of the elements of his paintings on art history, using still-life painting done in past centuries as a springboard. His work is in the following public collections: *Alberta Foundation for the Arts, Calgary *Art Gallery of Hamilton, Hamilton, Ontario *Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia *Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto (own Ricochet, 1980s) *Canada Council Art Bank, Ottawa *Confederation Art Gallery & Museum, Charlottetown *Edmonton Art Gallery *Glenbow Museum, Calgary, Alberta *Kitchener/Waterloo Art Gallery, Kitchener, Ontario *MacKenzie Art Gallery, Regina (own Harry (1980)) *Memorial University Art Gallery, Newfoundland *Mendel Art Gallery, Saskatoon *National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa *University of Calgary * University College of Cape Breton Art Gallery *Winnipeg Art Gallery He is married to painter Joice M.

Career Szladits went to work for the NYPL in 1955, and was named curator of the Berg Collection in 1969. As a curator, Szladits emphasized the Berg as a living research collection, rather than a museum. She greatly expanded the collection's manuscript holdings, collecting the notebooks and diaries, as well as published works and correspondence, of many modern authors. During her time as curator, she was responsible for planning and executing thirty-five exhibitions sharing \\"the appeal and richness of literature,\\" as well as composing their accompanying catalogues. She was often referred to simply as \\"Lola,\\" and reportedly treated the authors whose manuscripts she cared for with the same familiarity, referring to \\"Tom,\\" \\"Wystan,\\" and \\"Virginia\\" (i.e., T.S. Eliot, W.H. Auden, and Virginia Woolf). She was devoted to her work, and could be charming and helpful, but also \\"legendary\\" and \\"terrifying\\" to librarians and scholars alike. David H. Stam, who worked under her and fifteen years later as her supervisor, described her as \\"a dictatorial and mercurial boss and a conspiratorial subordinate.\\" In a book on the Bloomsbury Group, Regina Marler describes her as a \\"fierce... guardian\\" of Virginia Woolf's papers, and relates an anecdote from scholar Ellen Hawkes, who recalls Szladits as \\"pushing and pulling the fans, opening the roof vents for more air, and even crawling into the attic to inspect the pipes\\" during a New York heat wave. Ann Kirschner remembered her as \\"brilliant, bossy, impossible Lola Szladits,\\" describing \\"a life lived in service to an institution, inspiring, uncompromising.\\" Szladits was a member of the Grolier Club, and served several terms on their Library Committee.

The current rector of the ETA is Brigadier General Malkhaz Makaradze.https://eta.edu.ge/en/news/read/1109/national-defence-academy-has-a- new-rector History The Georgian military educations dates back to 1862 when the first military school was established in Tbilisi. On the occasion of Georgia obtaining its independence in 1918, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, Major General Giorgi Kvinitadze established the Georgian Junkers Military School\\". After the Red Army invasion of Georgia in early 1921, the school ceased to exist. During Bolshevik and Georgian Communist Party rule, the school was transformed into an institution of Red Army students, later being was renamed to the Tbilisi Higher Artillery Command School, which was abolished in 1992 upon the restoration of independence. On 28 May 1993 based on the order of Defence Minister Giorgi Karkarashvili, the United Military Academy of the Republic of Georgia was created. It began operating on 1 September 1993. On 20 February 2003 the Academy was given the honorific prefix of \\"David Aghmashenebeli\\" (David IV of Georgia in English.

In 2003, O’Donnell-Ames remarried to Warren Benton Ames, who had two children and lost his wife to ALS in 2000. His wife, Tina Singer Ames, had written a children’s book about ALS entitled What Did You Learn Today? Before beginning Hope Loves Company, this book was one of the sole resources O’Donnell-Ames had viewed for the children of ALS patients, and has now been sent by Hope Loves Company to children within the U.S. and internationally. As of June 2019, Camp HLC has been hosted 19 times in different locations across the U.S.  Leadership  Jodi O'Donnell-Ames is the founder of Hope Loves Company and held the position of president from the organization's beginning in 2007 before stepping down in 2019 to become community engagement director.

It has thin, fibrous or flaky bark, lance-shaped leaves with the narrower end towards the base, white flowers arranged singly on short side shoots and fruit remain on the plant at maturity. Description Leptospermum wooroonooran is a stunted, sometimes prostrate tree that typically grows to a height of . It has thin, rough, fibrous or flaky bark, the young stems silky hairy at first with a broad flange near the leaf base. The leaves are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide and strongly-scented when crushed. The flowers are white, in diameter and arranged singly on short side shoots. The flower buds have thin, papery, reddish brown bracts at the base but that fall before the flower opens. The floral cup is glabrous, long and the sepals are broadly egg-shaped, about long. The petals are long and the stamens or more long. Flowering mainly in November and the fruit is a capsule wide that remains on the plant at maturity. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum wooroonooran was first formally described in 1889 by Frederick Manson Bailey in Archibald Meston's report to the Queensland Government on his Government Scientific Expedition to the Bellenden-Ker Range (Woonooroonan). Distribution and habitat Wurunuru grows on windswept ridges on the mountains north-west of Mossman, in the Mount Spurgeon-Mount Lewis area and in the Bellenden Ker Range in north Queensland. Use in horticulture This teatree is sometimes grown in gardens, is suitable for heavy shade and is frost hardy but requires cool, moist conditions.
