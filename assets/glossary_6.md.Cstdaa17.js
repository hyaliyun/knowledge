Although JSAPI defines an interface only there are several implementations created by third parties, for example FreeTTS.  Core technologies  Two core speech technologies are supported through the Java Speech API: speech synthesis and speech recognition.  Speech synthesis  Speech synthesis provides the reverse process of producing synthetic speech from text generated by an application, an applet, or a user. It is often referred to as text-to-speech technology. The major steps in producing speech from text are as follows: * Structure analysis: Processes the input text to determine where paragraphs, sentences, and other structures start and end. For most languages, punctuation and formatting data are used in this stage. * Text pre-processing: Analyzes the input text for special constructs of the language. In English, special treatment is required for abbreviations, acronyms, dates, times, numbers, currency amounts, e-mail addresses, and many other forms. Other languages need special processing for these forms, and most languages have other specialized requirements. The result of these first two steps is a spoken form of the written text. Here are examples of the differences between written and spoken text: St. Matthew's hospital is on Main St. -> ‚ÄúSaint Matthew's hospital is on Main Street‚Äù Add $20 to account 55374. -> ‚ÄúAdd twenty dollars to account five five, three seven four.‚Äù The remaining steps convert the spoken text to speech: * Text-to-phoneme conversion: Converts each word to phonemes. A phoneme is a basic unit of sound in a language. * Prosody analysis: Processes the sentence structure, words, and phonemes to determine the appropriate prosody for the sentence. * Waveform production: Uses the phonemes and prosody information to produce the audio waveform for each sentence. Speech synthesizers can make errors in any of the processing steps described above. Human ears are well-tuned to detecting these errors, but careful work by developers can minimize errors and improve the speech output quality. While the Java Speech API 1 relied on the Java Speech API Markup Language (JSML), the newer release utilizes SSML to provide many ways for you to improve the output quality of a speech synthesizer.  Speech recognition  Speech recognition provides computers with the ability to listen to spoken language and determine what has been said. In other words, it processes audio input containing speech by converting it to text. The major steps of a typical speech recognizer are as follows: * Grammar design: Defines the words that may be spoken by a user and the patterns in which they may be spoken. * Signal processing: Analyzes the spectrum (i.e., the frequency) characteristics of the incoming audio. * Phoneme recognition: Compares the spectrum patterns to the patterns of the phonemes of the language being recognized. * Word recognition: Compares the sequence of likely phonemes against the words and patterns of words specified by the active grammars. * Result generation: Provides the application with information about the words the recognizer has detected in the incoming audio. A grammar is an object in the Java Speech API that indicates what words a user is expected to say and in what patterns those words may occur. Grammars are important to speech recognizers because they constrain the recognition process. These constraints make recognition faster and more accurate because the recognizer does not have to check for bizarre sentences. The Java Speech API 1 supports two basic grammar types: rule grammars and dictation grammars. These types differ in various ways, including how applications set up the grammars; the types of sentences they allow; how results are provided; the amount of computational resources required; and how they are used in application design. Rule grammars are defined in JSAPI 1 by JSGF, the Java Speech Grammar Format. The newer JSAPI 2 supports the more recent SRGS format. JSAPI 2 does not offer support for dictation.  The Java Speech API‚Äôs classes and interfaces  The different classes and interfaces that form the Java Speech API are grouped into the following three packages: * javax.speech: Contains classes and interfaces for a generic speech engine * javax.speech.synthesis: Contains classes and interfaces for speech synthesis. * javax.speech.recognition: Contains classes and interfaces for speech recognition. The EngineManager class is like a factory class that all Java Speech API applications use. It provides static methods to enable the access of speech synthesis and speech recognition engines. The Engine interface encapsulates the generic operations that a Java Speech API-compliant speech engine should provide for speech applications. Speech applications can primarily use methods to perform actions such as retrieving the properties and state of the speech engine and allocating and deallocating resources for a speech engine. In addition, the Engine interface exposes mechanisms to pause and resume the audio stream generated or processed by the speech engine. Streams can be manipulated by the AudioManager. The Engine interface is subclassed by the Synthesizer and Recognizer interfaces, which define additional speech synthesis and speech recognition functionality. The Synthesizer interface encapsulates the operations that a Java Speech API-compliant speech synthesis engine should provide for speech applications. The Java Speech API is based on event- handling. Events generated by the speech engine can be identified and handled as required. Speech events can be handled through the EngineListener interface, and more specifically through the RecognizerListener and the SynthesizerListener.  Related Specifications  The Java Speech API was written before the Java Community Process (JCP) and targeted the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE). Subsequently, the Java Speech API 2 (JSAPI2) was created as JSR 113 under the JCP. This API targets the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME), but also complies with Java SE.

Early life Plaque commemorating the Battle of Cable Street Kenton was born in Stepney, east London to a Jewish Ukrainian family who had escaped from Tsarist pogroms. ‚Äì reference to Kenton's place and date of birth His father died from tuberculosis when he was young. Kenton left school aged 14 and started work in a paper factory. There he first encountered anti-semitism, which led him to join the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1929. He took part in the CPGB's disruption of the British Union of Fascists' rally at Olympia in June 1934 and resistance to the BUF in the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936. Spain Early in 1937 Kenton left Stepney and rode his Douglas motorcycle to Albacete, where he join the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. His first wife Lillian, an Austrian nurse who fled Nazi Germany in 1933, shortly followed him. When he arrived at the International Brigades headquarters in Albacete, he applied to join the International Brigade's Medical Unit. It was from there that he spent nearly two years in action as medical courier on his motorcycle distributing medical supplies to hospitals across the country, and as an ambulance driver on the front lines. He returned to Britain late in 1938 on an 'Aid for Spain' mission to raise money for a new ambulance. By the time he had completed his tour, the International Brigades had been disbanded. Later life After the International Brigades were withdrawn from Spain, Kenton was hugely depressed. ‚Äì reference to Kenton's depression following the Republic's defeat One of his missions was to repatriate to the Spanish authorities the Basque refugees given asylum in the United Kingdom. It was \\"the first time I saw the fascist police in their three-cornered hats. All the children were in tears and all of them were hanging on to me as we checked each one and handed them over.\\" British \\"Lidice shall live\\" poster Kenton then joined the Merchant Navy and in the first part of the Second World War served on an Antarctic whaler, the Southern Princess. He and Lillian were divorced and in 1941 Kenton married his second wife Raffa Ephgrave. He was wounded in The Blitz, spent two years in hospital and then took a factory job. After the Lidice massacre in Czechoslovakia in 1942, Kenton joined the British \\"Lidice Shall Live\\" organisation. He was an active member for many years and in the 1990s served as its Chairman. After the Second World War, Kenton joined the Homes for Heroes campaign, which helped homeless ex-servicemen and their families to squat in unoccupied properties. He joined the Financial Times as a proofreader, and continued to work there until he was in his 70s. Kenton remained a devout communist, working tirelessly on trade union organisation, unemployed marches and party activities until 1968 when the Prague Spring was suppressed by the Soviet Union. He then joined the Labour Party and remained a member for the rest of his life. Commemorative potter From 1980 Kenton produced commemorative pottery for the trade union movement and for radical causes. His work was commissioned by Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, Tobacco Workers' Union, Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, Trades Union Congress, areas of the National Union of Mineworkers, the People's March for Jobs, the International Brigade, Greater London Council Peace Year, National Council for Civil Liberties, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the Greenham Common women's campaign.

The series follows Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), a private detective with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and multiple phobias, and his assistant Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard). In this episode, Monk is requested to be part of a jury for a minor crime but discovers one of the jurors is involved in a bigger crime. With influences from the film 12 Angry Men, the episode was written by Peter Wolk. It was mainly shot in Los Angeles and was directed by Andrei Belgrader. When \\"Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty\\" first aired in the United States on USA Network on March 17, 2006, it was watched by 5.4 million viewers. Plot Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) capture Miguel Escobar (Carlos G√≥mez), a drug lord who is on the FBI's Most Wanted List. They soon encounter FBI agent Lapides (Michael Weaver), who informs them that Escobar will be transferred to the federal government's custody. Stottlemeyer and Disher are to babysit Escobar until the extradition hearing. Elsewhere, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) has been selected for jury duty; he finds himself sitting in on the case of a young man named Robert Perry (Edo Walker), accused of stabbing and robbing a man named Karl Pillemer (Blake Silver). The other jurors are convinced of the accused's guilt, but Monk is the lone holdout. He observed that the hole in the victim's jeans show that Pillemer was sitting, not standing (as Pillemer had claimed), when attacked. The wound, Monk figures, was self-inflicted and the knife placed in Perry's hand while he was sleeping so Pillemer could pocket the money. Several of the jury members change their vote, but Monk is distracted by a dog sniffing around a dumpster outside. Monk asks Natalie (Traylor Howard), who is bringing Monk's lunch, to call Stottlemeyer and tell him there is a body in the dumpster. Disher finds the body of a woman with no I.D., and Monk remembers that she was in the assembly room when the jurors were selected. The following day, Monk shows the jurors evidence to prove Pillemer's guilt. The jurors are convinced, except for Juror No. 12, Pat (Emmanuelle Vaugier), who changes her vote to guilty before leaving for the bathroom. On Pat's jacket, Monk finds traces of lime, which was used on the dumpster to hide the body. Monk deduces that Pat killed the woman to get on jury using her identity, and has changed her vote to delay the verdict and stay in the jury room. However, none of the jurors, not even Monk, know that 'Pat' is Escobar's girlfriend, and it is the day that Escobar will be transferred to federal custody. Monk asks the other jurors to help him reveal the woman's deception. When she returns, they switch their votes to guilty to see her reaction. She reacts by producing a gun, knocking the bailiff unconscious and leaving the jurors bound and gagged to their chairs. She draws the blinds down but leaves them uneven. Meanwhile, Escobar is about to get on the federal courthouse elevator when his girlfriend comes over and shoots the guards. The two make their way up the elevator to the garbage chute, which is their escape route. Natalie, passing outside, sees the uneven blinds in the jury room window and knows something must be wrong. She frees Monk and they phone Stottlemeyer. When Escobar and his lover come down the chute, they land in the garbage dumpster, only to run into an assortment of waiting cops, who take them into custody. Production 12 Angry Men served as inspiration for \\"Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty\\". In the picture, Lee J. Cobb, actor in the film, whose last name was used to name Juror No. 4 of the episode. \\"Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty\\" was written by Peter Wolk and directed by Andrei Belgrader. While this marked Belgader's fourth credit in the series, it was Wolk's second episode, after writing season three's \\"Mr. Monk Gets Fired\\". Wolk, who previously worked as a criminal defense attorney, had also written coutroom-themed works such as The Defenders and Fighting the Odds. The story was written by Wolk over a week in 2005 in Summit, New Jersey. The episode was filmed in Los Angeles, apart from the opening Chinatown chase scene, which was shot on-location in November 2005 in San Francisco. Because of the opportunity to film on-location, the opening scene was re-written. The jury subplot was heavily inspired by the 1957 film 12 Angry Men. For example, Juror No. 4 Mr. Cobb was named after Lee J. Cobb (Juror No. 3 in the film), while the panning shot of the jury room was inspired by an identical shot toward the end of 12 Angry Men. Reception \\"Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty\\" was first broadcast in the United States on the USA Network at 10 pm EST on March 17, 2006. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by an estimated number of 5.4 million viewers. Adam Finley of TV Squad called the episode \\"decent,\\" but later went on to say \\"[Monk's] interaction between the rest of the jurors was hysterical.\\" A TV Guides reviewer called it \\"a humdinger of an episode\\", praised the chemistry between Shalhoub and Howard, and said the \\"ID-idea\\" joke was \\"neo-screwball comedy at its best.\\" The Digital Fix's Jon White praised the homage to 12 Angry Men, saying it shows the \\"obvious\\" care for the last four episodes of the season received. The Brazilian counterpart to Universal Channel, who broadcast Monk in the country, elected it as one of the ten best episodes of the series.

The following day, three Moroccans and two Indians were arrested, with a number of clues‚Äîsuch as a cassette tape with verses of the Koran in a white Renault Kangoo van in Alcal√° de Henares‚Äîthat pointed to al-Qaeda, or at least an Islamist involvement. Again the people of Madrid took to the streets, mainly congregating in the Puerta del Sol plaza, where there are a number of government buildings. This time the mood was not so peaceful. The crowd on Puerta del Sol chanted and bashed bottles and dustbin lids in a demonstration of anger towards Aznar. Meanwhile, people gathered in unofficial demonstrations in front of PP (Partido Popular) offices in all the major cities in Spain. The demonstrations of the 13 March were allegedly invoked via spontaneous cell phone messages ending in the phrase \\"p√°salo\\" (pass it on). The candidate of the governing conservative party, Mariano Rajoy, complained on television about the demonstrations and demanded that the opposition parties condemn them.E-mail, SMS and the Madrid bombings (DM) On behalf of the Socialist party, Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba gave a message saying that \\"the Spanish people do not deserve a government that lies to them\\" and that they had neither organized nor supported the demonstrations. According to Spanish electoral law, party-political demonstrations are illegal the day leading up to the election. Rumours circulated afterwards, and were propagated by film director Pedro Almod√≥var, that the government had approached King Juan Carlos and asked him to postpone voting, which the King responded would constitute a coup d'√©tat. Days later, the PP threatened to sue Almod√≥var for his comments. Political The attacks came three days before the Sunday elections. A decree declaring three days of official mourning was issued by the government, and five minutes of silence were observed on Friday.Pain Still Raw as Spain Remembers Victims (Deutsche Welle) Demonstrations were called for Friday evening in cities across the country, under the motto \\"With the victims, with the constitution and for the defeat of terrorism\\". The Catalan government led by Pasqual Maragall also declared official mourning in Catalonia. The government's chosen motto was very criticized by all the opposition because the \\"with the Constitution\\" inclusion in the motto implied that the bombs were set by the ETA, while many in the opposition believed that it was made by an Islamic group in retaliation for having Spanish troops in Iraq. The first government official to make an open public statement was Juan Jos√© Ibarretxe Markuartu, head of government in the Basque Country, two hours after the attacks. He unequivocally blamed ETA and said, \\"When ETA attacks, the Basque heart breaks into a thousand pieces\\". In another early public appearance, Interior Minister Acebes pointed in unambiguous terms to ETA, although by the end of the day he said that no line of investigation would be ignored. The head of the Catalan government Maragall said, \\"We are all Madrile√±os today\\", and continued: \\"if terrorists intended to divide us, they will have achieved the exact opposite, and the best way to reject terror is to vote on Sunday\\". Josep-Llu√≠s Carod-Rovira of the Catalan nationalist party, the ERC, who had recently come under fire for secretly meeting with ETA and advocating dialogue, said he would not communicate with ETA again but someone else should do so to prevent them from committing any more bloodshed. \\"We thought we had already seen everything, but unfortunately that was not the case\\", he lamented. By the time Aznar and the King had made their public statements in the afternoon, doubts over ETA's involvement were substantial enough that both of them avoided naming a culprit, and they referred just to \\"terrorists\\". Aznar insisted on the need to stay the course, echoing his Interior Minister's earlier remarks. Also, Queen Sof√≠a with his son Felipe de Borb√≥n (in this moment Prince of Asturias),and his couple, Letizia Ortiz arrived to Gregorio Mara√±√≥n Hospital in Madrid for know all the news about the victims and doctors. Many people suspected that ETA was being blamed in order to hide any al-Qaeda influence, since that could mean the massacre was in response to the Iraq war. According to the Real Instituto Elcano, this could have resulted in the Aznar government losing the Sunday elections. National Most TV stations reported the attack during their regular morning news programmes, starting around 08:00. The programme on Antena 3 lasted until 14:00. Madrid newspapers issued special midday editions, and TV stations rearranged their regular programming schedules. The public stations TVE (national) and Telemadrid (regional) did not break for commercials during the day. All TV stations replaced their logos with black ribbons overlaid on the Spanish flag at 18:00, visible in the upper-right corner of the television screen. That week, the satirical magazine El Jueves, known for its mordacious, highly provocative front pages, published a black front page for the first time in 25 years. People across Spain flocked to hospitals and mobile blood donation units in such numbers that the need for blood for transfusions was more than satisfied by 10:30, although continued donations were requested for the coming days. The deceased were moved to IFEMA, the largest convention centre in Madrid, for identification by their relatives. Riay Tatary Bakry, president of the Union of Muslim Communities in Spain, stated on 1 April 2004 that his organization had no plan to publicly urge mosques to step up their battle against terrorism. He said the union will continue to work privately with government officials. International The Spanish Embassy in Paris on 17 March. Sympathy poured in from governments worldwide immediately following the bombings, led by Spain's partners in the European Union. France raised its terror alert level, and Athens' security was tightened at train stations and the Spanish Embassy. Similar measures were adopted in Italy. World leaders were united in their condemnation of the attacks. The United States, United Kingdom, and Russia said the attacks demonstrated the need for a toughened resolve against terrorists. Queen Elizabeth II sent a message of condolence to the Spanish King on behalf of the British people. A PLO/Palestinian National Authority official also condemned the attacks targeting civilians. U.S. President George W. Bush called Prime Minister Aznar and King Juan Carlos to offer his condolences to the Spanish people and condemn the vicious attack of terrorism. He expressed \\"Our country's deepest sympathies toward those who lost their life...I told them we weep with the families. We stand strong with the people of Spain\\" The U.S. Senate observed a moment of silence and unanimously passed a resolution expressing outrage and urging President Bush to provide all possible assistance to Spain in pursuing those responsible for the attacks. President Bush led a memorial service at the Spanish ambassador's residence in Washington and gave an interview with a Spanish television network the following day. The US government created the Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response team (VIPR) programme in response to these attacks.Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Management, Investigations, and Oversight, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, United States Government Accountability Office, 23 July 2009 European Commission President Romano Prodi called the attack ferocious and senseless The European Parliament observed a minute of silence; its president Pat Cox expressed the parliament's condolences, and a resolution was introduced proposing 11 March as a European Day of Remembrance of Victims of Terrorism. Pope John Paul II condemned the bombings in a message to Catholic leaders in Spain. Many nations extended offers of material support to the Spanish government. By 17 March, governments around Europe had voiced their concerns that the Spanish government had jeopardized their security by feeding them false information about ETA's involvement. On 17 March 2004, German interior minister Otto Schily called for a special European summit to handle the Madrid bombings. The summit was held on 25‚Äì26 March 2004. The UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1530 condemning the bombings. This happened early in the day and, at the request of the Spanish government, the resolution accused ETA unambiguously of being responsible. The resolution condemns in the strongest terms the bomb attack in Madrid, Spain, perpetrated by the terrorist group ETA. After al- Qaeda involvement became clear, Germany and Russia voiced their concern over Spain's hasty assurances and suggested adding the word \\"allegedly\\" to the statement. On 15 March, Spain's ambassador to the UN Inocencio Arias submitted an unapologetic letter updating the Security Council on the progress of the investigation, repeating that the Spanish government had the strong conviction that ETA was involved. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said that:\\"I think there is a lesson here for everybody, including the council members\\". The human rights group Amnesty International condemned the attack, saying attacks targeting civilians could never be justified. The organization also pointed out that killing of civilians on such a scale may constitute a crime against humanity UEFA and the Spanish Government and Football Federation decided that Spanish football teams due to play matches on 11 March and 12 should do so, lest they give the impression that the militants had disrupted normal life, and the teams complied with this decision. Out of respect for the victims, members of Spanish football teams wore black armbands. The Spanish Government and Football Federation asked that all games involving Spanish teams begin with a moment of silence for the victims. Leaders across the world sent letters of mourning to king Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar. Most EU countries declared 12 March a day of national mourning as a sign of solidarity. There were demonstrations in cities across Europe and the Spanish- speaking world on 12 March, including Brussels, Paris, Lisbon, Helsinki, Geneva, Berlin, Stockholm, Buenos Aires, Mexico City and Bogot√°. Cuban President Fidel Castro was more critical, however. Speaking during a television interview on 13 March 2004 in Havana, Castro accused Spain's government of deceiving its citizens over the Madrid train bombings for electoral gain. He went on to assert that Prime Minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar had known an Islamic group was behind the explosions on 11 March, but preferred to blame ETA ahead of the general elections just three days away. Germany also condemned Aznar, who had not been told the explosives used were not of the type used by ETA. Otto Schily accused Aznar of not acting responsibly by claiming that the perpetrators were ETA ‚Äì therefore a national problem ‚Äì rather than al-Qaeda, which ought to have heightened the threat to other countries. Germany hastily arranged an urgent meeting of European Union security chiefs on 14 March 2004 as possible al-Qaeda involvement in the Madrid bombings set alarm bells ringing across the world. On the same day, Queen Elizabeth II ordered that the Spanish national anthem be played during the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace.Palace plays Spanish anthem (BBC News) The attacks also reawakened fears of terrorism amongst investors, with most European stock markets falling between two and three percent on 11 March. Stocks dropped in London and in New York, with the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average diving after speculation of involvement by al-Qaeda. Airline and tourism-related stocks were particularly affected by sharp declines in share prices. In Tokyo, stocks opened sharply lower the next day. On 15 March, at the request of Irish leader Bertie Ahern, then President of the European Council, all of Europe observed three minutes of silence at noon Central European Time (CET). Psychological Using the Emotional Climate Scale, the dominant personal emotions in response to 11 March were sadness, disgust, anger, and contempt. The most intense reaction was sadness rather than fear.(Conjero, 2007, 279) These negative emotions declined after two months.(Conjero, 2007, p.284) According to a study with 167 participants, some people experienced post-traumatic growth.(Barber, 2006, 413) Mostly women experienced post-traumatic growth, especially if they were indirectly exposed to the attack.(Barbero, 2006, 410) The emotional state of fear of those days in Madrid was the basis for a scientific work which showed the association between emotional states of fear and premature rupture of membranes at term. Popular culture In October 2004, the Spanish pop singer Luz Casal released her album \\"Sencilla Alegr√≠a\\", which included a song dedicated to the victims of the terrorist attack. Four years later, the popular music group La Oreja de Van Gogh released their album A las cinco en el Astoria with a song titled \\"Jueves\\", that served as a remembrance to this incident. Also in 2004, Antonio Soto-Mesa commissioned composer Francisco Est√©vez to write Canto de Vida y Esperanza, homenaje las v√≠ctimas 11-M which was premiered by Quinteto Soto- Mesa, a prestigious student group.

He currently manages Sir Tom Finney Ladies, the best women‚Äôs football team in the North West. He has held this position since the 27th of May 2020 and states he joined the team for the 15% discount from Morrisons (supplied by the teams best key worker, Big GP). Preston North End A striker and a product of the Preston North End youth system Nigel made his debut as a seventeen-year-old in a league game away at Lincoln City a game they lost 4‚Äì0. With Preston enduring difficulties both on and off the pitch Greenwood found himself being used no less than 17 times that season scoring 5 goals as the Deepdale club were relegated to the league's basement division for the first time in their history. The following 1985‚Äì86 season PNE were installed as favourites for promotion but they endured the worst season in the club's history with Preston finishing 91st in the football league and having to endure the stigma of applying for re-election. For Greenwood however the season was a personal triumph with him scoring 10 goals from 36 games indeed as an attacking side Preston were not too bad with duo John Thomas and Gary Brazil both scoring goals regularly. In fact between the three of them almost 50 goals were scored in defence however it was a different matter with the club conceding over 100 goals in all games for the second season running. Transfer In August 1986 though Greenwood was shocked to learn that Preston were prepared to sell him. Preston didn't want to sell him and Greenwood didn't want to leave but now that John McGrath was at the helm it was decided that funds needed to be made available to pay the signing on fees of the free transfer players he had lined up. Greenwood was considered to be worth ¬£20k the most saleable asset PNE had so with the promise from McGrath that once Preston were in a viable financial position they would bring him back to Deepdale Greenwood signed for third division Bury. Greenwood enjoyed three and a half seasons at Gigg Lane scoring 28 goals in 136 games for The Shakers several of these against Preston who on at least 3 occasions tried to bring him back to Deepdale. On each occasion however the Bury board and management rejected Preston's offer much to Greenwood's frustration. It was only in February 1990 when Bury wanted to sign Mark Patterson that Bury allowed him to return to Deepdale in a deal that was worth ¬£100k plus Greenwood to Preston. This deal turned out to be John McGrath's last as Preston boss as he resigned not two weeks later. Back at Deepdale Greenwood's second spell at Preston was a disappointment. With the club after three successful seasons again struggling both on and off the pitch. With Nigel struggling with injury and with the return of former favourite John Thomas to the club he found opportunities few and far between. Indeed in his two and a half years back at Preston he managed to play just 35 games scoring 5 goals before he was released in July 1992. Nigel immediately signed for Halifax Town for the start of the 1992‚Äì93 season but in 28 games he scored just 5 goals as The Shaymen were relegated from The Football League. In Nigel's senior career he had played 252 first team games and scored 53 goals but he was now looking to take his career to another stage in Non-League football. Bamber Bridge and beyond Nigel first signed for Bamber Bridge of the Northern Premier League where his brother and non-League legend Tony was manager becoming his assistant. Since then he has held a similar position at Accrington Stanley when Tony became manager there at the beginning of the 1996‚Äì97 season but they returned to Bamber Bridge two years later before in 2003 taking up the vacant job at Fleetwood Town where they guided the club to three promotions before leaving midway through 2008‚Äì09.

Eliot in 1919 that offers a critical reading of Hamlet. The essay first appeared in Eliot's The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism in 1920. It was later reprinted by Faber & Faber in 1932 in Selected Essays, 1917-1932.Eliot, T. S. Selected Essays. London: Faber and Faber, 1964. Eliot's critique gained attention partly due to his claim that Hamlet is \\"most certainly an artistic failure.\\" Eliot also popularised the concept of the objective correlative‚Äîa mechanism used to evoke emotion in an audience‚Äîin the essay. The essay is also an example of Eliot's use of what became known as new criticism.Eliot, T. S. \\"Hamlet and His Problems.\\" The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1921. __TOC__ Content Eliot begins the essay by stating that the primary problem of Hamlet is actually the play itself, with its main character being only a secondary issue. Eliot goes on to note that the play enjoys critical success because the character of Hamlet appeals to a particular kind of creatively minded critic. According to Eliot, a creative-minded individual who directs his energy toward criticism projects his own character onto Hamlet. As a result, the critic becomes biased in favor of and fixated on the character. Eliot accuses Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Samuel Taylor Coleridge of this, stating that Goethe's critique turns Shakespeare's tragic hero into his own Werther while Coleridge's \\"Lecture on Hamlet\\" made Hamlet into a Coleridge. Eliot wrote that due to their fixation on Hamlet rather than the play as a whole, the type of criticism that Coleridge and Goethe produced is \\"the most misleading kind possible\\". Eliot follows this by praising J.M. Robertson and Elmer Edgar Stoll for publishing critiques that focus on the larger scope of the play. He argues that a creative work cannot be interpreted, only criticized according to a standard or in comparison to another work. The function of interpretation in this argument is to make the reader aware of relevant historical information that they are not assumed to know. Eliot credits Robertson in particular for his historical interpretation of Hamlet. Next, Eliot names three sources on which Shakespeare is believed to have based his play: Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, The Ur-Hamlet, and a version of the play performed in Germany during Shakespeare's lifetime. He notes the differences between Hamlet and its source material, pointing out that in the earlier works the only motive for murder is revenge, the delay of which is the result of circumventing the king's guards. The Hamlet of the earlier play also uses his perceived madness as a guise to escape suspicion. Eliot believes that in Shakespeare's version, however, Hamlet is driven by a motive greater than revenge, his delay in exacting revenge is left unexplained, and that Hamlet's madness is meant to arouse the king's suspicion rather than avoid it. Eliot finds these alterations too incomplete to be convincing, and feels that the prose of the two texts is so similar in some sections that it appears that Shakespeare simply revised Kyd's text. Eliot concludes this section by agreeing with Robertson's assertion that the hero of Hamlet is driven more by his mother's guilt than revenge for the father, and Shakespeare fell short in combining this altered motive with his source material. The latter portion of the essay is dedicated to Eliot's criticism of Hamlet based on his concept of the objective correlative. He begins by arguing that the greatest contributor to the play's failure is Shakespeare's inability to express Hamlet's emotion in his surroundings and the audience's resultant inability to localize that emotion. The madness of Shakespeare's character, according to Eliot, is a result of the inexpressible things that Hamlet feels and the playwright cannot convey. Eliot concludes that because Shakespeare cannot find a sufficient objective correlative for his hero, the audience is left without a means to understand an experience that Shakespeare himself does not seem to understand. Objective correlative The objective correlative concept that Eliot popularized in this essay refers to the concept that the only way to express an emotion through art is to find \\"a set of objects, a situation, [or] a chain of events\\" that will, when read or performed, evoke a specific sensory experience in the audience. This sensory experience is meant to help the reader understand the mental or emotional state of a character.\\"Objective Correlative.\\" The Literary Encyclopedia. The Literary Dictionary Company Ltd., 01 Nov. 2001. Eliot writes that Hamlet's state of mind is a direct result of his confused emotions and the lack of external representation for these emotions in an objective correlative. He goes on to say that Hamlet's initial conflict is a disgust in his mother, but his feelings regarding the situation are too complex to be represented by Gertrude alone. Neither Hamlet nor Shakespeare can grasp or objectify these feelings, and so it acts as an obstacle to the character's revenge and Shakespeare's plot. But Eliot points out that if Shakespeare had found an objective correlative for Hamlet's internal conflict, the play would be entirely changed because the bafflement that characterizes it is a direct result of Shakespeare's shortcomings in this respect. Eliot does, however, give credit to Shakespeare's use of the objective correlative in his other works. As an example, he references a scene in Macbeth in which Lady Macbeth is sleepwalking and the imagined sensory impressions Shakespeare provides allow the audience to understand her mental state. Criticism One critical objection to Eliot's essay is that although Eliot begins \\"Hamlet and His Problems\\" with a complaint against critics that conflate Hamlet and its hero, he then spends a large portion of the essay focused on Hamlet the character and his effect on the play. It has been noted that if Eliot's intent was to focus his critique on the play, he could have titled his essay \\"Hamlet and Its Problems\\" instead.Moody, A. D. \\"Tradition and T.S. Eliot.\\" The Cambridge Companion to T. S. Eliot. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2006. 217‚Äì22. Some critics have also pointed out that Eliot offers no formal critique or concrete suggestions of how to improve the play.Murphy, Russell Elliott. \\"Hamlet and His Problems.\\" Critical Companion to T. S. Eliot: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work. New York: Facts On File, 2007. 246-48.Greenburg, Bradley. \\"T. S. Eliot‚Äôs Impudence: Hamlet, Objective Correlative, and Formulation.\\" Criticism 49.2 (2008): 215‚Äì39. Although many critics credit Eliot's concept of the objective correlative, some take issue with his discussion of the subject in this essay. Some critics argue that no individual can say with certainty what emotion Shakespeare intended to convey in Hamlet, and thus cannot attack Shakespeare for failing to express it. Others also feel that Eliot's critique of the play is too driven by his modernist views and that he takes Hamlet too much at face value.

Beckett was a founding staffer (Assistant Editor) of Nation Review, an irreverent and ground-breaking Sunday newspaper, nicknamed 'The Ferret', launched in 1970 by Gordon Barton. Beckett was its irascible and entertaining food columnist for eight years, using the pseudonym Sam Orr. He wrote several books on food and wine, alternative life-style, and Australian history. Richard left his home in Molong in early 1987, moving to Daylesford in Victoria. Single again and in poor health, he initially stayed at the Royal Hotel. Daylesford friends, concerned about his welfare, arranged for him to rent a miner's cottage high on Wombat Hill, near the Convent Gallery, where he lived for eight months. His trusted typewriter, usually with a wine glass on one side and a range of reference books on the other, remained in action as he wrote articles for the 'Age', Australian 'Epicure' and other publications. Richard's great friend John Hepworth kept in constant touch. When friends visited, Richard would take the opportunity to dine out, a meal at 'Lake House' being particularly memorable. Richard became particularly fond of his neighbours' grey cat, Orson - indeed, a piece about Orson was one of Richard's final articles for the Melbourne 'Age'. Richard described enjoying a walk in the snow in the Wombat Hill Gardens not long before he collapsed and died, alone, in August 1987. Richard was cremated at Fawkner Cemetery. Friends including Dinny O'Hearn, John Hepworth, John Hindle and Brendan Giffney met at a favourite Carlton hotel, 'Stewarts', to remember his life. Richard's obituary, 'The Press Loses A Fiery Spirit', written by his friend Kevin Childs, was published in The Age. A small group of friends led by John Hepworth farewelled Richard on a thundery day in Melbourne in late 1987, when according to his wishes, his ashes were strewn in the Yarra river.

Childhood and Education Otto was born at Scheer Castle to the Swabian noble House of Waldburg, which, for their support in the German Peasants' War was vested with the title of a hereditary Imperial Seneschal (Truchsess) by Emperor Charles V in 1526. Designated for an ecclesiastical career, he studied at the Universities of T√ºbingen, Dole, Padua, Bologna, where he received his degree of Doctor of Theology in 1534, and Pavia. He was a fellow student of Cristoforo Madruzzo, Stanislaus Hosius and Viglius van Zwichem. At an early age he had received canonries at Trent, Spires, and Augsburg. In 1541 he was appointed Imperial councillor and acted as a strong advocate of the Catholic faith against the Protestant Reformation at the 1542 Reichstag of Speyer. Thereafter, while on an embassy to Rome, was made a papal chamberlain and nuncio for the scheduled Council of Trent. Career On 10 May 1543, the skilled and ambitious man backed by Emperor Charles V was elected Prince-Bishop of Augsburg; in 1544 he was appointed Cardinal of the titulus of Santa Balbina by Pope Paul III for settling the dispute with the Emperor upon the concessions he had made to several Lutheran princes of the Schmalkaldic League at the Fourth Diet of Speyer. Otto however urged on a military expedition against the revolting nobles, which the Emperor prepared by forging an alliance with the (Lutheran) Duke Maurice of Saxony, when the Protestants in 1546 sparked the Schmalkaldic War by a preventive strike against the town of F√ºssen, a possession of the Augsburg bishop. He remained a loyal supporter of victorious Emperor Charles V, though he was dissatisfied with the terms of the Augsburg Interim and especially had further on to deal with the unruly population of the Imperial City of Augsburg. The conditions in his diocese were dreadful: the clergy were ignorant and depraved, and Protestantism was widespread. He sought to mend matters and to revitalize Catholicism through education, diocesan synods, visitations, edicts and improved religious instruction.. At his residence, he founded the University of Dillingen under Pedro de Soto, now a lyceum, and the ecclesiastical seminary at Dillingen (1549‚Äì55). In 1564 he transferred the management of these institutions to the Jesuits. In 1549‚Äì50 and again in 1555 he took part in the papal elections at Rome. The situation of the bishopric worsened in 1552, when it was devastated by the troops of the former ally Maurice, meanwhile Saxon Elector. The emperor's younger brother King Ferdinand I, now in charge and prepared to compromise, concluded the Peace of Passau with Maurice, which led to the 1555 Peace of Augsburg with the Lutheran princes. Otto's advice was no longer in demand and with the abdication of Charles V the next year, his powerful position finally was lost. He once more went to Rome in 1559 and was there made the head of the Inquisition and, in 1562, Cardinal- Bishop of Albano. In 1567 he held a diocesan synod at Dillingen. From 1568 he lived full-time at Rome, where he died. He was a moral, religious man, with great force of character, to whom half measures and shiftiness were foreign. He incurred the hatred of the Protestants for his protest against the Religious Peace of Augsburg. Cultural references A fictional version of him is seen in the third series of Showtime's Emmy Award‚Äìwinning show The Tudors. He is played by Swedish actor Max von Sydow.

All three had been inspired by Marcus Garvey (in 1916), and started spreading Garvey's message: of new hope for poor Blacks. Mr. Nathan was already established in St. Kitts as a merchant, and he decided to help establish and pioneer a movement whose goal was to eradicate hunger and poverty of the working class, and establish an acceptable standard of living. The association that these men formed was the Universal Benevolent Association. In addition, the Universal Benevolent Association was responsible for teaching reading, writing, and the rudiments of arithmetic. In addition, The Association encouraged saving and banking, and a death benefit plan. In 1918, J. M. Sebastian became the President of the Universal Benevolent Association. Together, Solomon, Wilkes, and Nathan founded an organization called the \\"Union\\", to help the poor, disenfranchised, marginalized, and underprivileged, in particular, those working in the sugar cane fields and at the Sugar Factory, in St. Kitts. F. Solomon was the President, J. Nathan was the Secretary, and G. Wilkes was the Treasurer. Union Messenger In 1921, the Union acquired its own newspaper, The Union Messenger, which became the mouthpiece for its message of social reform and reconstruction. However, the newspaper needed an editor. It was at this point that J. M. Sebastian resigned his teaching position, joined the three pioneers, and became the newspaper's Managing Editor, and President of the Union. In addition, before his death, Sebastian bought the rights to the newspaper, and he owned the printing press that was used at The Union Messenger. Upon Sebastian's death, ownership was passed to his widow, Mrs. Inez Veronica Sebastian, who then allowed the newspaper to continue to use the printing press (in perpetuity), and she appointed Joseph Nathaniel France the editor of The Union Messenger. In fact, Sebastian had been with the movement since 1917, however, being thrust into the limelight as Managing Editor of The Union Messenger and President of the movement, made it appear as if his involvement was a sudden one, but it was not. Sebastian always put at the top of The Union Messenger, the famous lines from Abraham Lincoln's second Inaugural Address, 1865: > \\"With malice towards none With Charity for all With firmness in the right.\\" In addition, the following dedication also appeared on every issue of The Union Messenger: > \\"Dedicated to the service of the people, that no good cause shall lack a > champion, and that wrong shall not thrive unopposed.\\" From, Meet My Father : > A Short Walk Through the Life of Joseph Matthew Sebastian, by Elise > Sebastian Marthol - July 7, 1993 Through The Union Messenger, Sebastian placed special emphasis on the problems faced by the disenfranchised population of St. Kitts and Nevis - housing, health and sanitation, education, and exploitation of children. Joseph Matthew Sebastian was its editor, and the newspaper exists today as The Labour Spokesman\\". His editorials were destroyed when the Courthouse at East Square Street burned down some years ago. However, some copies exist in private collections. The Union Messenger was widely read in the West Indies, the U.S.A, and Great Britain. Workers' League In 1932, the Workers' League was formed with Thomas Manchester as President. Sebastian was a founding member of the Workers' League and a member of its Executive Council. Political career In 1940 Sebastian was elected to the Legislative Council of Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla and for a second time in 1943. He was also appointed member of the Executive Council of the Leeward Island Colony, which sat in Antigua, which was the Headquarters of the Leeward Islands. In addition, Sebastian was elected to the Federal Executive Council of the colony in that same year. Because he sat on these two bodies, his title was The Honourable Joseph Matthew Sebastian. In addition, in 1940, Sebastian was among those who launched the Trade Union. That April the Sugar Factory workers went on strike. Sebastian, seeing the difficulties they were going to have to face, appealed to them to return to work. The response of the workers was very antagonistic; the workers sought out Sebastian with machetes and knives. However, they did not hurt him. In 1942, Sebastian succeeded Manchester as President of the Workers' League, and in 1943 - with an impending general strike, and following Challenger's resignation from the Union - Sebastian once again found himself at the forefront of the Union leadership. However, Sebastian suddenly died on June 25, 1944. In 1995, the only surviving son of The Honourable Joseph Matthew Sebastian and Mrs. Inez Veronica Sebastian (n√©e Hodge), Dr. Cuthbert Sebastian. O.B.E., was appointed Governor-General of St. Kitts and Nevis, and on January 1, 1996, he was sworn in. In 1996, he was knighted by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.

The house and grounds have belonged to the National Trust since 1929, but the house has only recently opened to the public on a regular basis.For information on opening times and dates see the National Trust website The grounds, which include part of the shoreline of Windermere, are open all year round and are renowned for their selection of specimen trees ‚Äì Wellingtonia, redwood, Ginkgo biloba, weeping lime and varieties of beech. Between March and October, Windermere Lake Cruises operate a passenger boat service from Ambleside and the Brockhole National Park Visitor Centre to Wray Castle. History The house was built in 1840 for a retired Liverpudlian surgeon, James Dawson, who built it along with the neighbouring Wray Church using his wife's fortune. After Dawson's death in 1875 the estate was inherited by his fifteen year old nephew, Edward Preston Rawnsley. In 1877 Edward's cousin, Hardwicke Rawnsley, took up the appointment of vicar of Wray Church. To protect the countryside from damaging development, Hardwicke Rawnsley, building on an idea propounded by John Ruskin, conceived of a National Trust that could buy and preserve places of natural beauty and historic interest for the nation. Beatrix Potter aged 16 stayed here in 1882 on a family holiday, beginning her long association with the Lake District. The house has an association with another key player in the National Trust, Beatrix Potter, who spent a summer holiday there when she was 16 in 1882. She bought a small farm in the Claife area, Hill Top, in 1905 with royalties from her first book The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She went on to buy considerable tracts of land nearby, though she never owned the castle itself. In 1929 Wray Castle and of land were given to the National Trust by Sir Noton and Lady Barclay. Since the National Trust acquired the castle it has been used for a variety of purposes, for short time from 1929 being a youth hostel For twenty years from 1931 the castle housed the offices of the Freshwater Biological Association. The Badge of \\"RMS Wray Castle\\" (as worn by some cadets during Merchant Navy College days)From 1958 to 1998 it became a training college for Merchant Navy radio officers (RMS Wray Castle), with up to 150 cadets living in the castle while studying the procedures and regulations regarding the use of radio for the ‚Ä≥Safety of Life at Sea‚Ä≥. The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System or GMDSS was introduced in 1988 and all ships had to be fitted by 1999, thus bringing to an end the position of radio officer. In 1995 the last 'Radio Officer' left and the college diversified into ROV and general telecoms training, finally leaving the Castle in 2004. In 2011 the National Trust proposed to lease the property, which had been denuded of its furnishings, for use as a hotel. However, they decided to open it to the public during the visitor season that year. High visitor numbers meant that the property, which in its empty state was particularly child-friendly, had clear potential to be developed as a visitor attraction. In 2014 the Trust applied for retrospective planning permission to change the use of the listed building to visitor attraction. Legacy A ship, the Wray Castle, was named after the site. It was one of five large vessels built at the Williamson shipyard at Workington for the Lancaster Shipowners Company, the others were Greystoke Castle, Lancaster Castle, Lowther Castle and Pendragon Castle. The Wray Castle was the fourth, an iron four-master launched in March 1889.

It stars Sanjay Dutt, Govinda, Karisma Kapoor, Pooja Batra, Anupam Kher, Kader Khan, Aruna Irani, and Paresh Rawal. The film is inspired by the 1966 film Pyar Kiye Jaa and went on to become the fifth-highest-grossing Hindi film of 1999. It is often regarded as being amongst Govinda's greatest performances and he won many awards for his role as Monu. Pyar Kiye Ja itself is a remake of the 1964 Tamil classic film Kadhalikka Neramillai which had been remade as the Telugu film Preminchi Choodu (1965), the Hindi film Pyar Kiye Jaa (1966), and the Kannada film Preethi Madu Thamashe Nodu (1979). Plot Amirchand (Kader Khan) is the ill-fated father of two mischievous sons‚ÄîSonu (Sanjay Dutt) and Monu (Govinda). Both of them are always up to one prank or another, most of them aimed at stealing money from Amirchand. In the opening scene, they call up their father, acting like gangsters, and ask for a huge sum if he wants to live. The plan fails as Amirchand turns out to be the driver of the taxi in which they were escaping. Later, they fix up the marriage of their father with Shakuntala (Bindu) and take one lakh rupees as advance dowry from her brother Jamnadas (Asrani). This plan also fails as Amirchand refuses to entertain Jamnadas and his sister. Amirchand warns their sons to become serious towards life if they want to live in his home. He asks Monu to join office and Sonu to go to Goa for claiming some money he had lent to someone. Whereas Monu plays another prank by calling up a girls' hostel and flirting with Ritu (Karisma Kapoor), Sonu mistakenly goes to one Gulzarilal Verma (Anupam Kher) for claiming the money, where he meets Pooja (Pooja Batra). Both Ritu and Pooja are Gulzarilal's daughters. Sonu and Monu fall in love with Pooja and Ritu, respectively. Sonu calls up Monu to come to Goa, disguised as his Uncle for fixing up his and Pooja's marriage. This leads to a series of confusions as Gulzarilal's sister Santho (Aruna Irani) also falls in love with Monu (disguised as Uncle). To get rid of the problem, Sonu and Monu throw a dummy of the Uncle from top of a cliff, only to land up getting arrested for killing the non-existent uncle. Amirchand comes to know of this and reaches Goa with his assistant Kunj Biharilal (Satish Kaushik). In favour of the story's and Sonu and Mon's fate, Amirchand and Gulzarilal turn out to be long lost friends. Together they set out towards the nearest police station when they get kidnapped by a Bhai (Ashish Vidyarthi). Sonu and Monu escape from the lockup with Bhootnath's (Paresh Rawal) help and rescue their father and to-be father-in-law, thus proving to be worthy sons.

Responsible Authority As a library of publications, JSPs are not the responsibility of any one person or organisation and over the years this has resulted in an unstructured group of publications many of which have become out of date. Future Development Reviews have been carried out into the way that JSPs are published and managed with a view to streamlining and improving the current system which may lead to the following implementations under the banner of the JSP 600 series: * Ownership for the various subject groups of JSPs * A process whereby the need and content of new JSPs will be vetted and agreed by the relevant Owner and Sponsor * A process for the regular review of JSPs to ensure their content remains current, and that obsolete JSPs are cancelled.

History  Armed Proletarians for Communism was founded in 1976, as one of the numerous armed groups spun out of Italian Autonomism (Autonomia Operaia). As opposed to the Red Brigades, the PAC was structured \\"horizontally\\", with independently constituted cells with their own actions. Most of the early members were young workers, unemployed people and teachers. An estimate 60 people were involved in the groupValerio Evangelisti, Valerio Evangelisti R√©pond √Ä 50 Questions in Lombardy and Veneto. The leaders of the PAC were Sebastiano Masala and Arrigo Cavallina who was considered to be the ideologue of the group. The group was dissolved in 1979.Fred Vargas, ¬´ Cesare Battisti : √Ä la recherche de la justice perdue ¬ª in La R√®gle du Jeu, n¬∞30 (01/2006)  Doctrine  Italian Autonomism held that the working class was a social group politically not represented, and exploited by ruling classes. A counter-power was to be organised by direct democracy and self-organisation. The movement drew upon theories of illegalism and propaganda of the deed formulated by the anarchist movement at the turn of the 20th century.Valerio Evangelisti, \\"Qu'est-ce que l'Autonomie ouvri√®re\\"in \\"Comit√© lyonnais de soutien √† Cesare Battisti\\" (collectif), Cesare Battisti face au marchandage, p. 44.  Actions  The first actions of the PAC were, allegedly, in support of workers' revendications. They notably attacked and wounded physician Diego Fava, and committed around 60 armed robberies, ranging from store attacks to bank robberies (what they called \\"expropriations\\"). The PAC also organised attacks against companies which used illegal workers, people whom they accused of brutalising detainees, or self-defence groups. Most of the \\"actions\\" did not cause victims, although the PAC did claim four murders: * Antonio Santoro, prison guard, was assassinated on 6 June 1978 in Udine, for allegedly mistreating a detainee and member of the PAC.Armando Spataro, \\"La culpabilit√© de Battisti repose sur des preuves\\" in L'Express, 15/3/2004 Cesare Battisti was sentenced for this murder. * Pierluigi Torregiani, jeweller, assassinated in his shop on 16 February 1979 in Milan. One month before, Torregiani had shot and killed a robber in an act of self-defense, during a robbery at a restaurant where Torregiani (who was carrying some of his most valuable jewels) was dining. Another client, Vincenzo Consoli, was killed in the gunfight, and another was wounded. During Torregiani's assassination, his 13-year-old son, Alberto, was wounded and was left paraplegic.The origin of the bullet which maimed Alberto Torregiani remains a controversy: some alleged that he was accidentally shot by his own father, while Italian justice blamed the militants. The four militants responsible for the assassination, Gabriele Grimaldi, Giuseppe Memeo, Sebastiano Masala and Sante Fatone, were identified and judged in 1981.Fred Vargas, \\"Et si Battisti √©tait vraiment innocent ?\\" in Le Monde, 13 November 2004 * Lino Sabbadin, butcher and member of the neo- fascist Italian Social Movement, assassinated on 16 February 1979 in Caltana Santa Maria de Sala, in Veneto. Sabbadin was killed by Pietro Mutti and Diego Giacomin.Gilda Piersanti, \\"Cara Fred, (lettre ouverte √† Fred Vargas sur l'affaire Battisti)\\" in Le Mague, 2 June 2004 * Andrea Campagna, DIGOS member, was killed on 19 April 1979 in Milan, allegedly by Cesare Battisti and an accomplice. He was involved in the investigations regarding Torregiani's assassination, and accused by the PAC of torturing prisoners. Torregiani and Sabbadin had defended themselves during hold-ups. They were assassinated on the same day, so as to teach people to \\"allow the deeds of the Proletarians forced to steal to survive\\". From 1982, following Pietro Mutti's arrest, Cesare Battisti was accused of taking part in Santoro's and Campagna's murders, as well as being an accomplice in Torregiani's and Sabbadin's assassinations. He was judged and sentenced in absentia in 1988 and in 1993. Battisti has always denied being involved in the assassinations. In October 2017 he was arrested in Corumba, Brazil, near the Bolivian border.

Origin The restaurant was named in a tribute to Guillaume Tirel, called Taillevent, a cook in the 14th century known to have written the first cuisine book in French, Le Viandier, ordered by Charles V of France. History In 1946 Taillevent restaurant was founded by Andr√© Vrinat in a dining room of the Worms, located at Saint-Georges street, 9th arrondissement of Paris; the chef was then Paul Cosnier. In 1948, it won its first star given by the French restaurant guide Guide Michelin. In 1950, the restaurant moved to the mansion of the Duc de Morny, built in 1852, which was a family house before becoming the embassy of Paraguay. Today the restaurant is located at 15, Lamennais Street, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. In 1954 Taillevent restaurant received its second star under the chef Lucien Leheu. Jean-Claude Vrinat, son of the founder and a graduate of HEC Paris, began working there in 1962. In 1973, Guide Michelin awarded three stars to Taillevent restaurant, under the direction of the chef Claude Deligne. Its pastry chefs have included Philippe Feret from Brasserie Julien. The chef Philippe Legendre began working at Taillevent in 1991. Since 1984, Taillevent has been a recipient of the Wine Spectator Grand Award. Diversification The wine shop \\"Les Caves Taillevent\\", n¬∞ 199 rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honor√© moved to n¬∞ 228 in the same street in Paris, France L'Angle du Faubourg now runs under the name Les 110 de Taillevent. In 1987, Taillevent opened a wine shop, Les Caves Taillevent, at 199 Faubourg Saint-Honor√© in Paris. This wine shop was under the direction of Val√©rine Vrinat, who began to work for Taillevent the same year. It has since been moved to n¬∞ 228 in the same street. In 2001, Taillevent's owners opened another restaurant, L'Angle du Faubourg, located at 195 Faubourg Saint-Honor√©. Michel del Burgo left Taillevent's kitchens to lead L'Angle du Faubourg, and was replaced by head chef Alain Soliv√©r√®s. Alain Lecomte became head pastry cook. This restaurant has since been renamed Les 110 de Taillevent. In 2004, Jean-Claude Vrinat decorated the restaurant with contemporary art, and in 2005 Les Caves Taillevent opened a second wine shop at Marunouchi, Tokyo in Japan. In June 2006 Jean-Claude Vrinat launched a blog in order to share his art-of- cooking experiences. The same year, a third wine shop, Les Caves Taillevent, opened in Printemps Haussmann, Paris. In 2013, Les Caves de Taillevent opened its first Middle Eastern branch in Beirut, Lebanon, in Les Jardins de Tabaris. After Alain Lecomte left Taillevent, Arnaud Vodounou became the new head pastry cook. Troubles On 21 February 2007, Jean-Claude Vrinat announced on his blogNews about the loss of the third star on Jean-Claude Vrinat's blog (fr) the loss of the third star, which was also referred to in the International Herald Tribune newspaper.

He ran for Colorado state governor as a write-in candidate and supported pro- legalization candidates, particularly Libertarian candidate Ralph Shnelvar in the 1990s.  Biography  Gorman graduated from Denver's Lincoln High School in 1964. As his father had before him, Gorman joined the air force, working as an air traffic controller. He worked in Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. He was stationed near Miyakojima in Japan at a long-range radar facility during the Vietnam War. His first wife introduced him to marijuana in Loveland, Colorado in 1969. Gorman was often quoted as saying \\"It has been a friend of mine ever since.\\" He went on to a career with the FAA as an air traffic controller. On August 5, 1981, while stationed in Hawaii, he was fired by Ronald Reagan along with 11,358 other PATCO (Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization) members who were on strike. After that, he worked in Papua New Guinea, recruiting students for \\"western-style\\" schooling. Around 1984, he became very friendly with the natives and gave them a public voice with radio broadcasts and newspaper articles about natives rights. Although he was arrested and charged with many crimes, he was only ever convicted on possession of pornography (a Playboy magazine). He was given a plane ticket to Manila, some spending money, and was escorted to the airport. Gorman's good friend, Pious Wingti, took power in 1985. Wingti's election victory was significantly due to the public outrage over Gorman's deportation. Later, he assisted the Philippine rebels in their quest to overthrow Ferdinand Marcos. He was forcibly deported in 1985. The Filipino people succeeded in deposing Marcos the following year. In 1992, while doing business-to-business sales for Video Professor, he read The Emperor Wears No Clothes by Jack Herer. Learning about \\"the marijuana conspiracy\\" made him so angry that he dedicated his life to revealing the truth about hemp and marijuana. Gorman started a company selling hemp products. He advertised marijuana in Denver's Westword Newspaper, on the locally famous \\"Back Page\\". The ad read, \\"MARIJUANA - FREE DELIVERY - NO COPS - NO JOKE\\". Later that year, Gorman started holding \\"smoke-ins\\" on the steps of the Colorado capitol building. One of his 1993 rallies featured \\"The Emperor Of Hemp\\", Jack Herer. He ran for Colorado state governor in 1994 and 1998. Arrest and death In May 1999, Gorman allowed himself to be arrested for selling three pounds of marijuana to a police informant who claimed to be buying it for medicinal purposes. Gorman served six months in the Jefferson County jail, 16 months in a Ca√±on City minimum-security facility, 18 months in a halfway house, and two years wearing a monitoring ankle bracelet. In 2000, Colorado adopted a constitutional amendment creating a medical marijuana system. After realizing the severe lack of medical grade marijuana available for patients, Gorman worked tirelessly to sign up caregivers to increase the availability of medicinal marijuana. He supported Libertarian candidates Rick Stanley for Senate and Boulder's Ralph Shnelvar for governor in 2002. The rallies continued several times a year, but Gorman had to \\"officially\\" remove his name as organizer due to the RAVE Act of 2002 and the Illicit Drug Anti- Proliferation Act of 2003. He supplied as many patients with caregivers or medicinal marijuana as he could. In 2004/2005, he was a featured speaker at meetings of the Colorado Compassion Club in Denver. On February 17, 2007, in Denver, Colorado, Gorman was shot in the chest in his living room.

The rides in Melbourne began in November 1995, and have occurred every month since, with between 100 and 1000 riders involved. Like most Critical Mass events in other cities, the Melbourne rides have fostered the development of a coherent urban cycling community, the focus of which is the temporary intentional community of the rides themselves.Blocking traffic? We are the traffic By Anna Krien, The Age, 28 March 2004. Accessed 9 May 2007 The biggest rides of the year are always held each November to celebrate the birthday of the first ride in Melbourne. These rides are typically five to ten times larger than a normal Critical Mass in Melbourne. This is also a suitable time of year to encourage cycling as the warmer weather arrives. Rides occur at 6:00pm on the last Friday of every month, with people congregating on the steps of the State Library of Victoria from around 5pm: .  Critical Mass and CityLink 1999‚Äì2004  Following its opening in 1999, Critical Mass rode onto CityLink eight times. A policy of facilitated tolerance was adopted by Victoria Police based on history of no previous problems with the Critical Mass rides. This section summarises media reports that occurred after CityLink highlighted the rides in the media, ultimately causing the police to change their policy in 2004. Critical Mass first crossed the Bolte Bridge in May 1999 before it was opened to traffic a few weeks later. In June 2003 Critical Mass Melbourne rode through the Burnley Tunnel for the second time. Police Minister Andre Haermeyer said it was up to police to decide how to deal with the protest, \\"I think everyone has the right to protest and I think most of us accept some modest amount of inconvenience as a trade-off against that democratic right,\\" and added \\"But this is just an outrageous impediment upon most people wanting to go home on a Friday night, the busiest night of the week.

Accessed 9 May 2007 Critical Mass on the Bolte Bridge, 27 February 2004 Cyclists rode over the Bolte Bridge in February 2004 as part of their Critical Mass ride. One of the complaints of Critical Mass is that the Bolte Bridge makes no provision for cycle access, whilst more broadly it further entrenches car and oil dependency. According to a police spokeswoman about 300 cyclists took part in the ride, forcing the closure of northbound lanes on the Bolte Bridge for about 25 minutes shortly after 7 pm. It was reported by the ABC that the protest minimally disrupted traffic.Bike protest does little to disrupt traffic ABC News online Friday, 27 February 2004.

Brian, an environment professional who attended the ride, told the Jon Faine program on ABC radio that the Burnley Tunnel was an appropriate target for such a protest, but routes are decided on the night by the riders \\"It (the route) is decided on the night by the people who are there. The Burnley Tunnel represents car-only infrastructure development by a private company to serve a public function.\\" He explained further that congestion on Citylink proved the infrastructure was failing and alternative means of transportation needed to gain greater prominence. \\"It (the ride) has raised the profile of the issue of the under-provision of infrastructure for bicycles and the failings of CityLink.\\" he said.Cycling crackdown discourages protest... maybe by Marc Moncrief, The Age, 26 November 2004.

Large infrastructure and major arteries were avoided in the interests of public safety and promoting cycling (and the event) as inclusive and enjoyable for everyone. After numbers of attendees dropped off during 2015, Critical Mass Melbourne was reduced to a small hardcore group of die-hards.

It lies in the northwest part of Columbia and consists of the neighborhoods of Longfellow, Swansfield, and Hobbit's Glen and had a December 1998 population of 8,695. Etymology Harper's Choice is named after Robert Goodloe Harper, a South Carolina representative who relocated to Baltimore to practice law. He was part of the Federalist mobs that stabbed, tarred and feathered British loyalists in Baltimore in June 1812. Harper later served in the War of 1812, Maryland State Senate, and United States Senate. He lived on his Oakland estate in the Roland Park area, where he was buried, although his grave was later moved to Baltimore's Greenmount Cemetery. The Longfellow community was named for the American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and the street names are taken from his works. Hobbit's Glen was taken from the works of English author J. R. R. Tolkien, along with the street names. Swansfield's name was inspired by the etching The Swan by James McNeill Whistler, and the street names derive from the works of Winslow Homer. History The majority of Harper's Choice is built on the original Carroll slave plantation tract Doughoregan Manor. The Harper family farm \\"Jericho\\" was built on a portion of the estate, and sold by the Harper family between 1962 and 1964 to the Rouse Company before the announcement of the Columbia project. Clarence Bassler sold 63 acres of his farm in 1963, with George Bassler selling 140 the next year, retaining land for the Harper's Choice Village Center. Home sites were sold by Howard Research and Development (Rouse) to larger homebuilders. Levitt & Sons, known for building Levittown, New York, bought land for over 600 units but halted construction in 1970 at 151 homes due to code violations. In August 1971, Harper's Choice Village Center opened with housing above shops. In 1978, the village suffered from a string of arson attacks, including 26 in a two-day period from a local resident. By the 1990s, the village center shops were in decline with little investment from the Rouse Company. In 2004, MS-13 gang activity was reported in the neighborhood. In 2007, a study determined that the Middle Patuxent Environmental Area of the Patuxent River was \\"fair to poor biological conditions and only partial support of habitat conditions\\" from runoff related to development in the Hobbit's Glen area. The Middle Patuxent Environmental Foundation was formed to study the issue in 2015 with a $38,000 Watershed Assistance Grant Program. Services The Harper's Choice Village Center has a grocery store, banks, restaurants, and other retail establishments.\\"Harper's Choice Village Center Directory\\" , columbiavillagecenters.com, accessed May 29, 2009 The community center, Kahler Hall, was named in 1971 for the William C. Kahler family, who sold a portion of their farm in November 1962 followed later by the remaining 280 acres. The original name for the village center was \\"Joseph Square\\", named for John Joseph, chairperson of the first Harper's Choice Village Board. In 1974, Peg Zabawa opened the landmark Mrs. Z's restaurant in an abandoned Wawa Inc. facility. The restaurant closed after burning in 1979. The Florence Bain Senior Center in the Swansfield neighborhood, opened in 1983 and was renovated in 2005. It is named for Florence Bain, whose son Henry worked on Rouse's original work group.

Many members of parliament continued to prefer railway travel, but Prime Minister Joseph Lyons was a regular aircraft passenger and regarded the introduction of dedicated aircraft for cabinet ministers as inevitable. In August 1939, by which time Lyons had died in office and been succeeded by Robert Menzies, a cabinet submission by defence minister Geoffrey Street identified that \\"special flying arrangements might be necessary for urgent movements which do not fit in with the timetable of the air services\\". World War II broke out the following month and a War Cabinet was formed, meeting several times a week. As a result, in early 1940 air minister James Fairbairn approved the conversion of four newly ordered Lockheed Hudson bombers into passenger aircraft suitable for ministerial use, to be operated by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The \\"VIP affair\\" of 1967 arose from the decision by the government and public service to maintain a veil of secrecy over the VIP flights program, attempting to conceal costs, destinations and passengers in order to prevent negative media coverage. This culminated in Prime Minister Harold Holt and Air Minister Peter Howson being found to have misled parliament over the existence of passenger manifests.

Tucoviƒá devoted his entire life to fighting for workers' and human rights, gender equality, universal suffrage, social justice and civil liberties in the Kingdom of Serbia. Some of the ideas that he advocated as a pioneer, today are widely accepted values in contemporary Republic of Serbia.http://www.telegraf.rs/vesti/politika/1317205-culi-ste-za-njega-a- znate-li-ko-je-on-dimitrije-tucovic-covek-koji-je-kritikovao-srbe-zbog- zlocina-nad-albancima  Life  Dimitrije Tucoviƒá was born 13 May 1881 in the Gostilje village on Mount Zlatibor, near ƒåajetina. Dimitrije Tucoviƒá was already an adherent to socialist ideas when he came to Belgrade in 1899 to finish high school. He agitated for socialism with Radovan Dragoviƒá, who was a big influence on him. In 1901, the Belgrade Workers' Society was renewed and Tucoviƒá recreated a socialist group of gymnasium students and became one of the leaders of the Society. He attempted to create modern unions. In 1902 he organised student demonstrations in the Senate against Nikola Pa≈°iƒá. With Tucoviƒá's and Dragoviƒá's help, the \\"Panel for Movement Leadership\\" was created again and they made the \\"Central Committee\\", with a goal of setting the grounds for creating a party. Tucoviƒá led the March demonstrations against King Aleksandar Obrenoviƒá on 5 March 1903. He was forced to emigrate to Zemun in the neighbouring Austria-Hungary, and afterwards to Vienna. Radniƒçke novine (Worker's Newspaper) from 1897. On 2 August 1903, the Social-Democratic Party was formed, with Dimitrije Tucoviƒá and Dragi≈°a Lapƒçeviƒá as one of the leaders. The editor of their newspaper, \\"Worker's Newspaper\\" was Tucoviƒá. During the Second Congress of a workers union SSDP (1904), Tucoviƒá gave a lecture on union organisations. In polemics with the left wing of the party, headed by Dragi≈°a Lapƒçeviƒá, Tucoviƒá often adopted a centralist and right-opportunist positions. In 1906, he graduated from the University of Belgrade's Law School. After coming back from Berlin, he gave up on his doctorate and started spending his time in socialist and labour movement, as a secretary of SSDP. Tucoviƒá was the organizer and leader of the first Balkan Socialist Conference, held in Belgrade from 7-9.

He participated at the International Socialist Congress in Copenhagen the same year and gave an important speech criticizing the position that Austrian social-democrats took on the national issue, especially the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In a debate with Karl Renner he pointed out the colonial-enslaving politics of Austro-Hungary and the fact that social-democrats were supporting the government on the issue. After the outbreak of the Balkan wars 1912, he was mobilized in the Serbian army and participated in the Serbian military campaign in Albania. He sent letters from the front about war crimes against civil population which were regularly published in the Worker's Newspaper.Tucoviƒáevo pismo o zloƒçinima srpske vojske nad Albancima Writing of the massacres of Albanians during the Serbian takeover of Kosovo from Turkey (1912), he stated: Captain Dimitrije Tucoviƒá After returning from the Balkan war, he published his influential book Serbia and Albania: A Contribution to the Critique of the Conqueror Policy of the Serbian Bourgeoisie, which analyzes the roots of Serbian-Albanian conflict and consider \\"among the most important Marxist contributions on the national question in the Balkans\\".Review of ‚ÄúSerbia and Albania‚Äù by Dimitrije Tucovic He died on the frontlines in World War I at Vraƒçe Brdo.

It occupies an abandoned railroad corridor that had been known as the Panhandle route which has been converted to a bicycle and walking trail. The rail line between Burgettstown and Weirton was closed in 1991, but Burgettstown to Walkers Mill closed in 1995. The original section of the trail is the West Virginia section, where the trail was called the Harmon Creek Trail, for the adjacent Harmon Creek. When Pennsylvania built its section, both states agreed to call it the Panhandle Trail. Although the Panhandle Trail occupies 29 miles of the Panhandle Route, the remaining portion of the route is owned by the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad, but it is no longer used.  History  The rail trail follows the same route as the former Panhandle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad that connected Pittsburgh to St. Louis and gives the trail its name. It is part of the government funded ‚ÄúRails to Trails‚Äù project. The first mile of the trail officially opened on October 29, 2000. About five months later on March 15, 2001 a group of volunteers was chosen to serve as the Panhandle Trail Association. Their purpose was to establish and manage the passage that would eventually link the Panhandle Trail to the larger Montour Trail. In January 2007 the connector was completed. Though the entire trail is accessible, the trail is paved from McDonald to the Pennsylvania/West Virginia state line. Because the trail is constantly under development there is no official completion date.  Organizations  The Collier Friends of the Panhandle Trail is an organization that manages a portion of the trail beginning at Walkers Mill. Another organization is the Montour Trail Council, who is in charge of a section in Allegheny County.  Location  The Panhandle Trail runs beginning at the Walkers Mill station in Walker‚Äôs Mill, Pennsylvania and ending in an area near Weirton, West Virginia. It passes many towns beginning in Harmon Creek and including Colliers, Hanlin, Dinsmore, Burgetstown, Joffre, Bulger, Midway, McDonald, Sturgeon, Noblestown, Oakdale, Rennerdale, and finally Walkers Mill. At the mark near McDonald, a one-mile connector links the Panhandle to the larger Montour trail.  Activities  The relatively flat trail is covered with crushed limestone, while much of the trail in Washington county is paved. This makes the trail suitable for walking, running, biking, horseback riding, and cross country skiing; however, motorized vehicles are prohibited. The Collier Friends of the Panhandle Trail host special events such as the annual Night Walk in October and \\"Rock the Quarry\\" which is a two-day festival in the fall that includes music, food, and games.  Stations and amenities  There are stations and special areas that serve as access points and provide parking places and also features like permanent restrooms, portable restrooms, shelter houses, picnic tables, vending machines, water fountains, maps, bike racks, and bulletin boards that provide event notifications and maps. In between these areas, many benches as well as a few portable restrooms and picnic tables have been placed along the trail. Nearly every mile has at least four benches (one at every quarter mile) and some have even more. The access points are located at the following places: * Walkers Mill Station - Found in Walkers Mill, Pennsylvania this station is the beginning of the trail and provides parking, a picnic shelter, benches, a water fountain, a bulletin board and a portable restroom. * Rennerdale Station - About into the trail in Rennerdale, Pennsylvania the station has parking, a picnic shelter and a bulletin board. * Gregg Station - Located at the mark in Oakdale, Pennsylvania the station also has parking, a picnic shelter, portables restrooms, and a bulletin board. ** Settler's Cabin Park connector - This partially complete (in 2015) trail connects to the nearby Settler's Cabin Park. * Oakdale Station - Also in Oakdale at mile 3.75, the station offers parking, picnic tables, a bike rack and a water fountain. * Sturgeon - At the mark in Sturgeon, Pennsylvania there is an area with available parking, permanent restrooms, vending machines, a shelter house and a bulletin board. * McDonald Trail Station - This station in McDonald, Pennsylvania at mile 7.25 is special because it is near the intersection of the Montour and Panhandle trails. The station offers parking, restrooms, an information center, trails maps, vending machines, a large map of the trail and McDonald and picnic tables. * Village of Primrose - Located at mile 8.75 in Primrose, Pennsylvania there is an area with a parking lot, portable restroom, bulletin board and trail map. * Midway - Around mile ten in Midway, Pennsylvania there is a parking area and bulletin board. * Bulger - At mile 13.5, a small village with a veterans memorial. *Burgettstown - Trail Station, restrooms, Gift Shop, Walden‚Äôs Restaurant * Dinsmore Road - In Burgettstown, Pennsylvania where Dinsmore Road crosses the trail around the 19th mile, parking is available as well as a bulletin board. * Colliers West Virginia - At mile 22.25 in Colliers, West Virginia parking, benches, a picnic table and a bulletin board are available. * Harmon Creek - The final access point is at the mark in Harmon Creek, West Virginia where there is a parking lot, some benches, a picnic table a bulletin board.

He was forced to flee to the great Padan forest known as the Selva Cornea, where he and numerous followers were beheaded by pagan, or alternatively by Arian, enemies in the area of what is now Casale Monferrato. He is venerated as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church and is the patron of a number of towns in Piedmont and Lombardy. His cult is liveliest at Casale, where his remains are conserved in the cathedral dedicated to him.  Life  Evasius as Bishop of Asti from a 1677 ex voto in the Confraternita della Trinit√† No account of Evasius's life is regarded by scholars of hagiography as reliable. According to the Historia e vita di Sant'Evasio Vescovo e Martire by the Augustinian Fulgenzio Emiglio, published in 1708, he was born in Benevento, moved to Rome in 260 and was sent as a bishop to Asti in 265. There he suffered persecution at the hands of pagan opponents of Christianity and was forced to leave the town. The earliest account of the story, the anonymous Passio Sancti Evasii, which has been variously dated at early eleventh-century, tenth-century and ninth-century, sets it in the times of the Lombard king Luitprand, who reigned during the years 712‚Äì744. In the versions deriving from the latter, Evasius's opponents were Lombard adherents of Arian Christianity, rather than pagans. Still other accounts place his life during the fourth century and have him consecrated as Asti's first bishop around 330. Carbon dating of his relics (assuming that they are genuine) favours the third-century hypothesis. It is said that following his flight from Asti, Evasius took refuge in the forest known as Selva Cornea along with two companions Proietto and Maliano and probably a third, Natale. At the site of today's Pozzo Sant‚ÄôEvasio, near Casale, a miracle occurred. The bishop, tired from his journey, pushed his crozier into the ground and lay down to sleep. The pastoral staff set root and blossomed and a spring appeared at its foot. Evasius continued his work of conversion in Casale (then perhaps known as Sedula, or Sedulia), founded a small church dedicated to Lawrence the Deacon and attracted numerous followers. (The remains of such a church exist beneath the current cathedral.) In some accounts he is identified as the first bishop of Casale. Again, however, the saint attracted fierce opposition, and he was beheaded along with Proietto, Maliano and 143 companions, on the orders of the prefect (or duke or sculdascio) Atubolo. Skeletal analysis of his remains suggests that Evasius died at about the age of 60. In the version of his life which sets it in the third century, the date of Evasius's martyrdom is given as 1 December 292, during the reign of Diocletian, whose later persecution of Christians is well known. For the version of the story which places it in the first part of the eighth century, the context is that of the struggle between those Lombards who remained attached to their Arian beliefs and the soon-to-be-victorious Trinitarian new guard, associated particularly with the Catholic Theodolinda who had been Lombard queen from 588 to 628, and to which King Luitprand belonged.  Legacy  Saint Natale is held to have escaped the massacre and to have become priest of the church which was newly dedicated to Evasius and in which his remains were sepulchred. At the same time the church was perhaps rebuilt on a larger scale with the support of Luitprand. Casale, now itself named after the saint as \\"Casale di Sant‚ÄôEvasio\\", grew up around the church during the middle ages. A new and much larger church was consecrated by Pope Paschal II in 1107. In 1215 Ghibelline Casale was sacked by the anti-Imperial forces of Alessandria and Vercelli together with the support of Milan. The saint's remains were removed to Alessandria along with other booty. In 1403 Casalese condottiere Facino Cane brought the relics back from Alessandria, following a military victory over that town. The church of Sant‚ÄôEvasio became a cathedral with the establishment of the Diocese of Casale in 1474. At Pozzo Sant‚ÄôEvasio (literally \\"Saint Evasius‚Äôs Well\\") in 1670 a church was erected over the miraculous spring, which had been turned into a well whose waters were reputed to cure diseases.  Feast days  Evasius's feast day was entered into the Roman Martyrology as 1 December, and it is on that day that he is celebrated in Asti. He is also the patron saint of Rocchetta Palafea in the Langhe, of Pedrengo in the Province of Bergamo (who were given some relics‚Äîpart of a leg, and a bone from the foot‚Äîin 1609Giuseppe Cappelletti, Le chiese d'Italia della loro origine sino ai nostri giorni, 21 vols (Venice: 1844‚Äì70), XIV: Stati Sardi: Torino e le sue chiese suffraganee (1858), p. 586.), and of Bizzarone in the Province of Como. In Casale Monferrato in the Province of Alessandria he is the patron saint both of the Diocese and of the Commune. Here his feast is kept on 12 November in memory of the day on which Facino Cane returned the relics to the town. Notes References  * Duomo di Casale Monferrato  la storia  Sant'Evasio * Pieve di S.

He specializes in the Celtic harp, which he began playing in 1973. His instrument, a custom-made cl√†rsach, has 38 gold-plated bronze strings and a special mechanism that allows him to bend notes in a manner akin to blues musicians; a style that he often adopts in his improvisations. He has also developed electro-acoustic instruments. A peripatetic musician devoted to exploring all musical cultures, Oppermann has collaborated with folk musicians from around the world (particularly Africa and Asia), who he often invites to play at his Klangwelten music festival in Germany, yet he favours an experimental approach in playing traditional melodies, often involving improvisation, unusual instrumentation and sometimes even electronics, including digital-delay effects. He has written and performed music for dance theatre productions and small jazz-influenced combos in addition to folk music ensembles. A musician with a wide and eclectic artistic vision, he has dedicated his compositions to artists as diverse as medieval mystics such as Rumi and Hildegard von Bingen, fellow harpists such as Alan Stivell and Deborah Conant, and modern-day rock and jazz improvisors on electric guitar. He also recorded one album with jazz harpist Park Stickney. Oppermann's records usually feature some solo performances on the wire-strung Celtic harp alongside band pieces involving folk musicians from around the world (playing traditional instruments), and sometimes a few jazz musicians, to accompany him. Rudiger Oppermann might be best described as a free-style and experimental folk musician, who draws on both ancient and modern musics and musical traditions, to create a melting pot of musical cultures that cannot be ascribed to any one folk tradition. On the sleeve notes to his record 'Unchain my Harp' (1994), he described himself as seeking to create \\"fresh buds on old trees with strong roots.\\" He is married to the classical harpist Cynthia (Mowery) Oppermann. He does not play classical music himself but his compositions, often involving intimate ensemble playing, can have some similar qualities to chamber music or early music ensembles, notwithstanding their electro-acoustic sound or frequent use of non-European rhythms and percussion. The classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin was one of the first internationally renowned artists to express appreciation for Oppermann's artistic originality and very distinctive musical sound.

Incorporation By 1994, a section of militants who felt marginalized by the ISI's favoring of the Islamist Hizbul Mujahideen over other groups sought alternate avenues. The Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen was formed by Mohammad Yusuf Parray, better known as Kuka Parray and by early 1994, the group sided with the Indian security forces to fight the Islamist militants backed by the Pakistani government. Besides Ikhwan, other groups operated by Javed Ahmad Shah (who had the backing of the state police's Special Operations Group) and Liaqat Khan (who operated in Kashmir's Anantnag district). By the end of 1994, all three groups had merged into one entity known as Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen.  Activities  Many prominent fighters for the Ikhwan contested the 1996 elections. Kuka Parray founded the Jammu and Kashmir Awami League and won by earning a few hundred votes. Javed Ahmad Shah joined the National Conference. Some of the Ikhwani renegades are in prison for their crimes against Humanity including the notorious renegade Papa Kishtawari. Disbandment After the 1996 assembly elections, due to the public's detestation of their ruthless tactics and several publicity campaigns by civil society organisations, the Ikhwan quickly found themselves ostracised by the political establishment. The official cover for the armed group was stripped soon after by the Indian government which led to a huge spike in casualties. Ikhwan is expected to have lost over 150 members. According to a 2003 report by The Hindu, nearly 350 to 500 members of Ikhwan remained on active duty with the Jammu and Kashmir Police and the Indian Army and were paid a regular stipend. Kuka Parray was killed by kashmiri militants in 2003 while he was on his way to a function in Sonawari, District Bandipore. Javed Ahmad Shah was also killed a month earlier by militants at the Greenway Hotel in Srinagar. Liaqat Khan another notorious renegade continues to live in Kashmir.

He was the joint-leading scorer in the Scottish Football League in the 1914‚Äì15 season. Career He was born at 40 Edmund Street in Dennistoun, Glasgow, the son of Robert Gracie, flesher, and his wife, Harriet Bell.https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=33048&p;=0 Gracie studied bookkeeping upon leaving school before finding work as a meat salesman. He was concurrently playing Junior football for Shawfield, then Strathclyde, but in 1907 he was offered the chance to move into League football when approached by Airdrieonians, third-placed finishers the previous season. After short spells with Hamilton Academical and Arthurlie, he joined Morton in 1910.[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 In 1911, Gracie was selected as a reserve for Scotland's game against England at Goodison Park. Although he wasn't required to play, and would never gain an international cap, the journey proved profitable for him as he was signed by Everton at the game's conclusion. A season later he switched to the red half of Merseyside, signing for Liverpool in an exchange deal which saw Harold Uren move to Everton in exchange for Gracie and Bill Lacey. Unlike Lacey, however, Gracie was unable to establish himself in the Liverpool first team, making only sporadic appearances in his two and a half seasons at Anfield. When the opportunity arose to return to Scotland in 1914, he was glad to take it, admitting to feeling \\"unappreciated\\" in the south. Gracie's destination was Hearts, manager John McCartney paying ¬£400 for him as a replacement for the recently sold Percy Dawson. The Maroons were a rapidly emerging side and started the 1914‚Äì15 season with eight straight victories, including a 2‚Äì0 defeat of reigning champions Celtic in which Gracie scored, to become early league-leaders and title-favourites. Gracie was selected for the Scottish League XI in November 1914. First World War However, this streak coincided with the start of the First World War and the beginnings of a public debate upon the morality of continuing professional football while young soldiers were dying on the front-line. A motion was placed before the Scottish Football Association to postpone the season, with one of its backers, Airdrieonians chairman Thomas Forsyth declaring that \\"playing football while our men are fighting is repugnant\\".McCrae's Battalion, 15 While this motion was defeated at the ballot box, with the SFA opting to wait for War Office advice, the noted East London philanthropist Frederick Charringtonn was orchestrating a public campaign to have professional football in Britain suspended, and achieving great popular support for his cause.McCrae's Battalion, 21-24 The prime tactic of Charrington's campaign was to shame footballing players and officials into action through public and private denouncement, and as Gracie was then the leading scorer in the side leading the top division in Scotland, he was an obvious target for the anti-football crusade, much to his distress.McCrae's Battalion, 71 Gracie's response, and that of 10 of his team-mates, was to enlist in Sir George McCrae's new volunteer battalion, joining on mass on 25 November 1914. The battalion was Edinburgh's second pals battalion and was to become the 16th Royal Scots and was the first to earn the \\"footballer's battalion\\" sobriquet. Military training was thus added to the Hearts players football training regime, although this didn't initially stop the side's progress, as they compiled a 20-game unbeaten run between October and February. However, exhaustion from their army exertions, twice including 10-hour nocturnal-marches the night before a league game,McCrae's Battalion, 95-99 eventually led to a drop in form, as several enlisted players, including Gracie, missed key games. Defeats to St Mirren and Morton allowed Celtic to usurp the Maroons and eventually claim the league title by 4 points. For Gracie, finishing as the league's joint top-scorer, tied on 29 goals with Ayr United's James Richardson was scant consolation. Illness and death Gracie however faced a far more serious problem ‚Äì in March 1915 he was diagnosed with leukemia, a prognosis he had shared only with manager McCartney.McCrae's Battalion, 114 Despite his illness and against medical recommendation he decided to continue to play with Hearts and train with his battalion, and indeed scored 4 times during that month. He was still with the battalion when they were sent south to Ripon in June for further training but within weeks he had succumbed to fatigue and was committed to hospital in Leeds for treatment, before being transferred back to Scotland.McCrae's Battalion, 109 Gracie died on 23 October 1915 in Stobhill Hospital in his hometown Glasgow and was buried at Craigton Cemetery. His death concluded a dark year for the Gracie family, who had also lost Tom's brother John and brother-in-law Tommy during 1915's hostilities.

Since being decommissioned in 1992, the bunker has been open to the public as a tourist attraction, with a museum focusing on its Cold War history. Building and intended purpose The three-level bunker was first built on compulsory-purchased farmland as an air defence station (an 'R4' Sector Operations Control or SOC) as part of the RAF ROTOR air defence project. Upon the demise of the ROTOR SOC the remaining Nuclear Reporting Cell and UKWMO elements were incorporated into a Home Office 'Regional Seat of Government' or RSG. The bunker was able to hold various numbers (in the hundreds) of military and civilian personnel, the numbers changing over the years as the role of the building changed from SOC to RSG and in its later years; 'Regional Government Headquarters' or RGHQ. In the event of a nuclear strike the RSG / RGHQs etc. would be tasked to organise the survival of the population and continue government operations. History The Kelvedon Hatch bunker was built in 1952-53 as part of ROTOR. ROTOR was a programme to improve and harden Britain's air defence network. It was constructed by Peter Lind & Company of London who still trade today. The bunker was a hardened (three level 'R4') Sector Operations Centre (SOC) for RAF Fighter Command. It was to provide command and control of the London Sector of Fighter Command. During the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and early into the 1990s, the UK government (Home Office) maintained the bunker as an emergency regional government defence site. Eventually in the early 1990s when nuclear threat was seen as diminished, the bunker was sold back to the farming family who had owned the land in the 1950s. It is now a Cold War museum and retains many of its original ROTOR and RSG/RGHQ features. Inside the bunker Inside the bunker The bunker is built underground and the entrance is through an ordinary looking bungalow (a standard ROTOR 'Guard House') set amongst trees. The inside of the bungalow leads to a tunnel entering the R4 at its lowest floor (of three). Above are two more floors, the 'hill' which covers it, and a radio mast some distance away. The bunker was able to accommodate some hundreds of personnel (the numbers changing as function and form varied over the years) and could sustain them for up to three months. The bunker has air conditioning and heating (using the original ROTOR AC-Plant but replacing the original coolant with a more 'modern' type [c.1980s]), its own water supply (mains water and its own deep bore hole) and generators, and was equipped with many types of radio equipment, protected (EMP) telecommunications, teleprinter (MSX) networks and various military systems: MOULD (system to provide communications between Regular Army, TA Battalions and the Army District and Regional Headquarters) and CONRAD (radio government communications systems post nuclear strike) etc. Modern times By 1992 the bunker was no longer required, so was decommissioned and the land was sold back to the original owners, the Parrish family. It has now been renovated and made into a museum and tourist attraction; many locals appreciate the irony of the many brown tourist road signs in the area, clearly directing people to the \\"Secret Nuclear Bunker\\". The BBC TV show Top Gear featured the signs. The bunker was used as a \\"Killer's Location\\" for The Murder Game. Both the living quarters and the operational zone were set up for the \\"Killer's Game\\" in the finale. It also played a significant role in an episode of New Tricks titled \\"The Queen's Speech\\", first broadcast on BBC1 on 20 October 2014. In 2010 the independent British post-apocalyptic/horror film S.N.U.B! was filmed in the bunker. The 2016 full-motion video game The Bunker, which uses live-action footage, was fully filmed inside the bunker. In recent years the land surrounding the ex- secret Nuclear Bunker has been used for Obstacle racing events, provided by the 'Nuclear races' company.

Royal Navy Rank slide of a Royal Navy able seaman In 1653 the Royal Navy introduced a new pay scale as part of reforms following defeat in the Battle of Dungeness the previous year. Included in these reforms were, for the first time, separate pay scales for more experienced seamen. It distinguished between an ordinary seaman and an able seaman. The higher ranked able seaman was required to be competent in steering, use the lead and working aloft, and received about 25% higher pay than an ordinary seaman. In the middle of the 18th century, the term \\"able seaman\\" (abbreviated AB) referred to a seaman with more than two years' experience at sea and considered \\"well acquainted with his duty\\".Naval Records Society: Five Naval Journals 1787-1817. Cited in Lavery 1989, p. 129 Seamen with less experience are referred to as landmen (for the first year at sea) or ordinary seamen (for the second). In time of war (such as the Seven Years' War or the Napoleonic Wars), with many more warships in service, the navy, merchant marine, and privateers competed ferociously for the limited pool of able seamen, leading to the unpopular use of impressment by the Royal Navy to keep its ships manned. In peacetime, with fewer active warships, there was usually a surplus of unemployed able seamen willing to work in the navy. As late as the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy's practice of stopping American ships to press American sailors into involuntary service was one of the main factors leading to the War of 1812 with the United States. Royal Canadian Navy Sleeve Insignia for an able seaman In the Royal Canadian Navy, Sailor Second Class (previously Able Seaman until August 2020) is the second-lowest of the non-commissioned member ranks, ranking above Sailor Third Class and below Sailor First Class. Sailors Second Class wear a single gold chevron, point down, as an insignia of rank; it is worn on the upper part of both sleeves of the service dress tunic, and on slip-ons on both shoulders on other uniforms. In all trades, the rank is awarded on completion of 30 months of service, by which time all initial training is completed. Consequently, it is sometimes said that promotion to the rank of Sailor Second Class means the recipient has lost their 'best excuse', on the theory that Sailors First Class are generally assumed to know nothing. Sailor Second Class is the equivalent rank to private (trained), or simply private, in the Army and Air Force. In French the rank is called matelot de 2e classe.

Cited in Lavery 1989, p. 129 An AB may work as a watchstander, a day worker, or a combination of these roles. Once a sufficient amount of sea time is acquired, then the AB can apply to take a series of courses/examinations to become certified as an officer. Watchstander At sea an AB watchstander's duties include standing watch as helmsman and lookout. A helmsman is required to maintain a steady course, properly execute all rudder orders and communicate utilizing navigational terms relating to heading and steering. A watchstander may be called upon to stand security- related watches, such as a gangway watch or anchor watch while the ship is not underway. Dayworker mast for painting Knowing how to safely work aloft to maintain cargo rigging is a skill required of an AB.An AB day worker performs general maintenance, repair, sanitation and upkeep of material, equipment, and areas in the deck department. This can include maintenance of the ship's metal structures such as chipping, scraping, cleaning, priming, and painting. Areas frequently in need of such maintenance include the hull, decks, superstructure, cargo gear, and smoke stack. Day workers also frequently perform maintenance on lifeboats, rescue boats and liferafts, and emergency and damage control gear. For many vessels, being a dayworker is a position granted to senior AB's, since it generally allows more time for rest and relaxation. General duties An AB may be called on to use emergency, lifesaving, damage control, and safety equipment. Able seamen perform all operations connected with the launching of lifesaving equipment. An AB is expected to be able to operate deck machinery, such as the windlass or winches while mooring or unmooring, and to operate cargo gear. Able seamen require advanced training, including lifeboatman certification. The ship's boatswain, if carried, is typically a senior AB. The boatswain is in charge of the able seamen and ordinary seaman that comprise the unlicensed deck crew, and reports directly to the chief mate. Certification=United StatesTraining= AB's were in high demand during World War II.The Code of Federal Regulations establishes in 46 CFR 12.05 five categories of able seaman for the United States Merchant Marine: #Able Seaman‚ÄîAny Waters, Unlimited. Requires three years service on deck on vessels operating on the oceans or the Great Lakes. #Able Seaman‚ÄîLimited. Requires 18 months service on deck in vessels of 100 gross tons or more which operate in a service not exclusively confined to the rivers and smaller inland lakes of the United States. #Able Seaman‚ÄîSpecial. Requires 12 months service on deck on vessels operating on the oceans, or the navigable waters of the United States including the Great Lakes. #Able Seaman‚ÄîSpecial (OSV).

Requires six months service on deck on sail or auxiliary sail vessels operating on the oceans or the navigable waters of the United States including the Great Lakes. Time served in certain training programs and school ships may be substituted for the time of service listed above. Special certificates of service are available for able seaman, Great Lakes‚Äî18 months service; able seaman, any waters‚Äî12 months; able seaman, tugs and towboats‚Äîany waters; able seaman, bays and sounds‚Äî12 months, vessels 500 gross tons or less not carrying passengers; and able seaman, seagoing barges‚Äî12 months. =Examination requirements= For the United States Merchant Marine, the Code of Federal Regulations establishes in 46 CFR 12.05 examination requirements for the certification of able seamen, which includes: * Competence as a lifeboatman, including showing # training in all the operations connected with the launching of lifeboats and liferafts, and in the use of oars; # acquaintance with the practical handling of boats; including the ability to command the boat's crew. * An examination, conducted only in English, consisting of questions regarding: # lifeboats and liferafts, the names of their essential parts, and a description of the required equipment; # the clearing away, swinging out, and lowering of lifeboats and liferafts, and handling of lifeboats under oars and sails, including questions relative to the proper handling of a boat in a heavy sea; # the operation and functions of commonly used types of davits; # knowledge of nautical terms; boxing the compass, either by degrees or points; running lights, passing signals, and fog signals for vessels on the high seas, in inland waters, or on the Great Lakes depending upon the waters on which the applicant has served; and distress signals; and, # knowledge of proper response to commands for handling the wheel and knowledge of the use of engine room telegraph or bell- pull signals. * In the actual demonstration, the applicant shall show ability by taking command of a boat and directing the operation of clearing away, swinging out, lowering the boat into the water, and acting as coxswain in charge of the boat under oars. The AB shall demonstrate ability to row by pulling an oar in the boat. The applicant shall also demonstrate knowledge of the principal knots, bends, splices, and hitches in common use by tying them. * The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the officer in charge, marine inspection, knowledge of pollution laws and regulations, procedures for discharge containment and cleanup, and methods for disposal of sludge and waste material from cargo and fueling operations.

Able-bodied seaman Some modern references claim that AB stands for able-bodied seaman as well as, or instead of, able seaman. Able seaman was originally entered using the abbreviation AB instead of the more obvious AS in ships' muster books or articles. Such an entry was likely to avoid confusion with ordinary seaman (OS). Later the abbreviation began to be written as A.B., leading to the folk- etymological able-bodied seaman. The \\"correct\\" term, able seaman, remains in use in legal documents, in seaman's papers, and aboard ship.

The Studio of the First Exhibition of the Soci√©t√© Nouvelle de Peintres et de Sculpteurs at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris. Georges Petit (11 March 1856 ‚Äì 12 May 1920) was a French art dealer, a key figure in the Paris art world and an important promoter and cultivator of Impressionist artists. Early career Petit was the son of Fran√ßois Petit, who founded the firm of art dealers at 7, rue Saint-Georges (Paris) in 1846.Galerie Georges Petit ‚Äì Research at The Frick Collection Retrieved 2017-07-28 Within just a few years, the Galerie Fran√ßois Petit was among the most powerful firms in the French art market. According to Robert Jensen in his book Marketing Modernism in Fin-de-Siecle Europe, the auction house assumed, \\"multiple roles that ran the gamut from certifying the authenticity of the object, to guiding it through the hazards of the marketplace, to establishing its provenance and enlisting critics and historians to situate the artist's importance.\\"Jensen, Robert; Marketing Modernism in Fin-de-Siecle Europe; 1994; Page 51 Georges Petit inherited the firm, as well as a ch√¢teau and 3 million francs in 1877. He constructed a town house on the rue de S√®ze. His annual expenses amounted to some 400,000 francs. That's what he spent to support his wife, children, mistress... and shooting expenses. Jensen quotes √âmile Zola as saying that the younger Petit was \\"more ambitious than his father‚Ä¶ competitive to the point of wanting to ruin his rivals\\". Jensen continues, \\"[Petit] would wait‚Ä¶ for the Americans to arrive in Paris every May. And what he bought for 10,000 francs, he sold for 40,000.Jensen, Robert; Marketing Modernism in Fin-de-Siecle Europe; 1994; Page 61 Impressionism Petit began buying Impressionist works as early as 1878, when he served as an expert in the sales of works from the collections of Jean Victor Louis Faure and bankrupt former Claude Monet patron, Ernest Hosched√©. Petit was just 22 years old at this time ‚Äî and it was only a year after he inherited the business ‚Äî so his involvement with the Impressionists began with the commencement of his career. However, according to a biography at the National Gallery of Art (USA), this was at the end of the Impressionists' \\"lean years,\\" and their works had already begun to find a market. Rivalries and rise to prominence Cattle Drinking is a painting by Constant Troyon, exhibited in 1883 in the galleries of Georges Petit. Auction Scene / Galerie Georges Petit (1911), watercolor by Gustave Francois, courtesy ArtNet.com The Old Beggar (1916) by Louis Dewis, seen by Petit in 1917 at Le Salon franco-belge at the Bordeaux Public Garden, after which Petit offered Dewis his patronage. Petit had an intense rivalry with art dealer Paul Durand- Ruel (1831-1922). Durand-Ruel took over his business from his father in 1865. The Petit and Durand-Ruel galleries had been the top two firms in Paris dating back to the 1850s. Paul Durand-Ruel was 25 years older than Petit and had become an advocate of the Impressionists as early as 1870. The gallery which Petit opened at 12, Rue Godot de Mauroy in 1881 was a popular alternative exhibition space to the official Salon.University of Glasgow; The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler: Georges Petit Petit's gallery later relocated to 8, rue de S√®ze in the heart of Paris.Georges Petit Gallery - Marcel Proust Ephemera Site Petit made his private views into grand social occasions. He devised the series of Expositions internationales de Peinture, the first of which was held in 1882. John Singer Sargent sent his portrait of Vernon Lee to the inaugural event, a work which received decidedly mixed reviews. Sargent wrote, \\"it has been exhibited ‚Ä¶ and has consternated many people.\\"O'Hare, Mary-Kate; John Singer Sargent and Modern Womanhood; The Magazine Antiques; 1 March 2006Trevor J. Fairbrother; John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist; Seattle Art Museum; 2000; Page 51 These events attracted the likes of Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Auguste Rodin, Alfred Sisley and James McNeill Whistler.Catalogue for the sale of the Collection George Petit, March 4-5, 1921 Sisley held large retrospective exhibitions at the Galerie Georges Petit in the 1880s and 1890s. This was something of a coup for Petit, as Sisley had been previously associated with Durand-Ruel. In 1897, Petit exhibited 146 Sisley paintings and 5 of his pastels, covering the whole of his career. Two years later, just months after Sisley's death, the paintings remaining in Sisley's atelier were sold at auction by the Galerie Georges Petit to the benefit of his children. \\"Formidable salesman\\" The biography posted by the National Gallery of Art notes that, \\"Petit also dealt in Salon painters and handled the works of many successful and fashionable artists of the period, rivaling another Parisian dealer, Boussod & Valadon [successors to Goupil & Cie]. He enjoyed the reputation of being a 'formidable salesman', and most important Paris auctions... were held on his premises because the H√¥tel Drouot accommodations were insufficient. This fact only increased his rivalry with Durand-Ruel, as Petit did not care to have his competitor officiate as 'expert' at public sales held in his gallery\\". Michael C. FitzGerald, writing in his book The Making of Modernism, says that, \\"by the 1890s [Petit had] wrested many of the Impressionists from their first dealer, Durand-Ruel, and presented such important exhibitions as Monet's Morning on the Seine and Norman coast series. According to √âmile Zola, who knew the Parisian art world inside and out, Petit was the 'apotheosis' of dealers when the Impressionist market soared and competition among marchands... became intense.\\"FitzGerald, Michael C.; The Making of Modernism: Picasso and the Creation of the Market for Twentieth- Century Art; 1995; Page 193 Petit held a number of auction sales on his premises, including the Narishkine collection in 1883, the Chocquet and Doria collections in 1889 and Edgar Degas' studio sale in 1918‚Äì19.Dumas, Anne; The Private Collection of Edgar Degas, Volume 1; Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.); Page 309 In 1919, Petit convinced Louis Dewis, a Sunday painter from Bordeaux, to sell his substantial men's clothing business there and move to Paris, where Petit promised \\"to make him famous.\\"Obituary of Louis Dewachter, Journal de Biarritz (Biarritz, France), 17 December 1946LouisDewis.comCatalogue for Dewis Rediscovered (1998), Courthouse Galleries, Portsmouth, Virginia But just months after the Post-Impressionist relocated, Petit died on May 12, 1920. The biographer at the Whistler Centre writes that Petit's Soci√©t√© internationale de Peinture was run on similar principles to the Grosvenor Gallery. Like the Grosvenor, it had an advisory body of artists (including Alfred Stevens, Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta and Giuseppe De Nittis), but in fact was run by Petit alone. Other artists such as Paul Baudry, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, Jozef Isra√´ls, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, John Everett Millais, Ludwig Knaus and Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel were also involved. According to the Whistler Centre, beginning in 1881, \\"the gallery was associated with print publishing and specialised in monochrome, very high quality reproductive engravings of paintings by contemporary artists such as F√©lix Bracquemond and Marcellin Desboutin\\". In 1887, Auguste Rodin exhibited The Kiss and three figures from The Burghers of Calais at the Galerie. In 1889, Rodin and Monet held a joint exposition there, with Rodin showing 36 works. According to the August Rodin Project, the \\"Georges Petit exhibition sealed Rodin‚Äôs position as France‚Äôs premier sculptor and opened doors to collections and museums around the world.\\" In the late 1880s, Petit turned down Louis-Ambroise Vollard (1866‚Äì1939) for an apprenticeship because he knew no foreign languages. Vollard would, himself, become a legendary art dealer... as well as an avid collector and noted publisher. Vollard played an important role in the careers of Paul C√©zanne, Maillol, Picasso, Rouault, Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh. The Galerie after Petit After Petit's death, the Galerie Georges Petit was acquired by prominent art dealers/brothers Gaston and Josse Bernheim-Jeune and their partner √âtienne Bignou. George Keller, who was establishing a relationship with Salvador Dal√≠ at this time, became director in 1929. Henri Matisse held at large retrospective at the Galerie in 1931, the largest exhibition of his works in France to that date. In 1932, the Galerie hosted an important retrospective of the works of Pablo Picasso. Art historian Michael C. FitzGerald writes that, \\"displaying 225 paintings, seven sculptures, and six illustrated books, the exhibition was a blockbuster. Apart from sheer size, the show ranged across Picasso's career from 1900 to the early months of 1932.\\" FitzGerald opines, \\"the Galerie George Petit was a paradigm of the new relationships among dealers and collectors that formed in the early thirties.\\" He continues, \\"although bearing an illustrious name in the history of modern art, the gallery was far from its origins when the Picasso retrospective hung.\\" The Galerie Georges Petit closed in 1933 and its assets were sold at auction.

Concept For the album, original group members Tom Rapp, Wayne Harley and Lane Lederer were joined by Jim Bohannon, who replaced Roger Crissinger. Like the group‚Äôs previous LP recorded on ESP-Disk, entitled One Nation Underground, it was recorded at Richard Alderson's Impact Sound studio in New York City. Recordings took place sometime in early 1968, but no complete records of the sessions have been published. Some CD reissues have stated that it was recorded in 1965, but this is an error. Lederer left the group during or shortly after the recordings, and the basic group was augmented by studio musicians. Rapp stated that he wanted to produce a themed anti-war album, and chose the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava in 1854 as an example of the futility of war. The album was dedicated to Private Edward Slovik, the only United States soldier executed for desertion during the Second World War. Producer Richard Alderson said: \\"I had made great progress in building up my studio on West 65th Street in NYC where Balaklava was recorded. I had added many microphones, outboard gear, and a very early Ampex 8 track 1‚Äù master recorder. We also had a collection of many exotic musical instruments and a great selection of sound effects available. This enabled a full studio production palette.... Balaklava was primarily an anti- war statement, and secondarily an aural essay on the history of sound and recording. Often these premises are conjoined\\". Richard Alderson, \\"Tom Rapp, Pearls Before Swine, and The Making of Balaklava\\", 2018, RichardAldersonAudio.com, 2018. Retrieved 21 January 2019 The album cover The front cover is a detail of The Triumph of Death by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, showing a grotesque allegorical depiction of the horrors of war, while the back cover showed a photograph of a young girl at an anti-war protest taken by Mel Zimmer. The cover also included the quote \\"Only the dead have seen the end of war\\" by George Santayana, together with surreal and horrific drawings by avant-garde artist Jean Cocteau. The cover contributed to the mystique surrounding the group: few if any photographs of its members were published, and Pearls Before Swine did not perform in concert until 1971. The songs The album starts with the track \\"Trumpeter Landfrey\\", taken from an archived 1890 cylinder recording that had been reissued on 78rpm records in the 1930s. His real name was Martin Lanfried;Internet Archive: Details: Trumpeter Landfrey's Charge of the Light Brigade he was one of the original buglers from the 1854 Battle of Balaclava. The recording segues into \\"Translucent Carriages\\", one of the band's most enduring songs which Rapp subsequently performed, both with the band and as a soloist, including at the Terrastock 6 Festival in 2006. Simply performed with acoustic guitar, it contains breathing noises and whispered lines of commentary, including a quote from the ancient Greek historian Herodotus: \\"In peace, sons bury their fathers/ in war, fathers bury their sons.\\" \\"Images of April\\", in contrast, is an evocation of nature, featuring dubbed bird songs throughout. After \\"There Was A Man\\", a simpler story-based folk song, \\"I Saw The World\\" has become another highlight in the band's career. Its heartfelt lyrics were written by a 21-year-old Rapp, with such examples such as \\"I saw the world spinning like a toy, hate seems so small compared to it all, so why don‚Äôt you do joy?\\" The sound is supplemented by overdubs of natural sound recordings, including waves as well as wind chimes, and by a lush string arrangement by Warren Smith. \\"Guardian Angels\\" is a ballad that was recorded with the intention to sound as if it was a scratchy 1920s 78rpm record, and the illusion was taken further by a date attached to the title (\\"recorded in Guadelope, Mexico, in 1929‚Ä¶\\") on the sleeve. The second side of the LP starts with a version of Leonard Cohen's \\"Suzanne\\", featuring a unique double bass marimba played by Warren Smith. This is followed by \\"Lepers and Roses\\", a complex ballad full of allegorical classical references, which was arranged by Al Schackman, best known as accompanist to Nina Simone, and also featured Joe Farrell on flute. After an archived recording of Florence Nightingale's voice, the final track, entitled \\"Ring Thing\\", is a dramatic musical evocation of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, complete with crashing gongs and bagpipe drones. According to Alderson: \\"The bagpipe player was told to play anything he wished and just walk around the studio playing. He was wearing his NYPD uniform pants during the overdub and was understandably confused.

Some of the reissues of Balaklava on CD have that section edited out. Release The album repeated the band's critical success in the underground college scene of the late 1960s, and has subsequently been regularly rated the highest of all albums by either Rapp or the band. Following the album's release, Rapp backed out of his ESP contract and signed with Reprise Records. After seven further albums he retired from music in the mid-1970s, went back to school and became a successful civil rights lawyer for over three decades. He returned to perform and occasionally record in the mid-1990s. Reissues and cover versions The original album has been reissued several times on compact disc since the 1980s.

The term \\"algorithm engineering\\" was first used with specificity in 1997, with the first Workshop on Algorithm Engineering (WAE97), organized by Giuseppe F. Italiano.Workshop on Algorithm Engineering Difference from algorithm theory Algorithm engineering does not intend to replace or compete with algorithm theory, but tries to enrich, refine and reinforce its formal approaches with experimental algorithmics (also called empirical algorithmics). This way it can provide new insights into the efficiency and performance of algorithms in cases where * the algorithm at hand is less amenable to algorithm theoretic analysis, * formal analysis pessimistically suggests bounds which are unlikely to appear on inputs of practical interest, * the algorithm relies on the intricacies of modern hardware architectures like data locality, branch prediction, instruction stalls, instruction latencies which the machine model used in Algorithm Theory is unable to capture in the required detail, * the crossover between competing algorithms with different constant costs and asymptotic behaviors needs to be determined.\\"Towards a Discipline of Experimental Algorithmics\\", Bernard M. E. Moret, web: http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97865/files/dimacs_algorithmics.pdf Methodology Some researchers describe algorithm engineering's methodology as a cycle consisting of algorithm design, analysis, implementation and experimental evaluation, joined by further aspects like machine models or realistic inputs. They argue that equating algorithm engineering with experimental algorithmics is too limited, because viewing design and analysis, implementation and experimentation as separate activities ignores the crucial feedback loop between those elements of algorithm engineering. Realistic models and real inputs While specific applications are outside the methodology of algorithm engineering, they play an important role in shaping realistic models of the problem and the underlying machine, and supply real inputs and other design parameters for experiments. Design Compared to algorithm theory, which usually focuses on the asymptotic behavior of algorithms, algorithm engineers need to keep further requirements in mind: Simplicity of the algorithm, implementability in programming languages on real hardware, and allowing code reuse. Additionally, constant factors of algorithms have such a considerable impact on real-world inputs that sometimes an algorithm with worse asymptotic behavior performs better in practice due to lower constant factors. Analysis Some problems can be solved with heuristics and randomized algorithms in a simpler and more efficient fashion than with deterministic algorithms. Unfortunately, this makes even simple randomized algorithms difficult to analyze because there are subtle dependencies to be taken into account. Implementation Huge semantic gaps between theoretical insights, formulated algorithms, programming languages and hardware pose a challenge to efficient implementations of even simple algorithms, because small implementation details can have rippling effects on execution behavior. The only reliable way to compare several implementations of an algorithm is to spend an considerable amount of time on tuning and profiling, running those algorithms on multiple architectures, and looking at the generated machine code. Experiments See: Experimental algorithmics Application engineering Implementations of algorithms used for experiments differ in significant ways from code usable in applications. While the former prioritizes fast prototyping, performance and instrumentation for measurements during experiments, the latter requires thorough testing, maintainability, simplicity, and tuning for particular classes of inputs. Algorithm libraries Stable, well-tested algorithm libraries like LEDA play an important role in technology transfer by speeding up the adoption of new algorithms in applications. Such libraries reduce the required investment and risk for practitioners, because it removes the burden of understanding and implementing the results of academic research.

Nearby settlements include Waterton and Eiffelton to the north, and on the other side of the Hinds River, Lowcliffe to the west. The small township of Hinds is to the northwest, while the nearest significantly sized town is Ashburton, further north.

It was formed when three local schools amalgamated in 2000 and caters for students in grades 1 to 8.Longbeach School, About Us , accessed 20 March 2007 In the 1860s, there was a proposal to build the Main South Line railway between Christchurch and Dunedin on a coastal route that would have passed through Longbeach, but this was abandoned in favour of a more inland route through Ashburton that had easier river crossings. However, Longbeach continued to lobby for a railway. In 1878, a proposal was made to extend the Southbridge Branch from Southbridge across the Rakaia River to Longbeach and Waterton. It was primarily intended to serve agricultural interests in the area. Although an appropriate location for a bridge was found, the government never acted on the proposal and it lapsed.\\"Proposed Extension: The Proposed Extension of the Southbridge Branch Line\\", New Zealand's Southbridge Branch Line, accessed 13 November 2007.

It is the seat of the municipality of Lefktro in the region of Messenia on the Mani Peninsula. In the Iliad (Book 9 The Iliad by Homer Book IX. ·ºôœÄœÑ·Ω∞ Œ¥Œ≠ ŒøŒØ Œ¥œéœÉœâ ŒµœçŒΩŒ±ŒπœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ± œÄœÑŒøŒªŒØŒµŒ∏œÅŒ±, ŒöŒ±œÅŒ¥Œ±ŒºœçŒªŒ∑ŒΩ, ŒàŒΩœåœÄŒ∑ŒΩ œÑŒµ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ŒäœÅŒÆŒΩ œÄŒøŒπŒÆŒµœÉœÉŒ±ŒΩ, And will give him seven well established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where there is grass; (translation by Samuel Butler).), Homer cites Kardamili as one of the seven cities offered by Agamemnon to Achilles as a condition to rejoin the fight during the Trojan War. The village preserves its ancient name. The area is filled with beaches: Ritsa, Belogianni, Salio, Tikla, Amoni, Santava. The older town includes a mediaeval castle and outworks, and the imposing church of Saint Spyridon. Many of the buildings of Old Kardamili, also known as \\"Pano Kardamili\\", or \\"Upper Kardamili\\" were built by the Venetians and feature a mix of traditional Greek and Venetian design. The skyline of Kardamyli, like many other Maniot towns and villages, is dominated by the distinctive regional architectural of the various towers built by scions of the Nikliani clans, the mediaeval aristocracy of the Mani. Kardamyli is the departure point of many mountain trails, some of which lead to the peak of Mount Taygetus. Kardamili is known in the area for having an especially good view of Mount Taygetus, known locally as the \\"Profitis Ilias\\", literally translating to \\"Prophet Elias\\". Nearby is the Viros Gorge, with a total length of 20 km. The Viros Gorge remains bone dry in summer, however it is known to flood heavily in winter, when snow melts on the mountains and rain falls in heavy downpours. Further afield, one may visit Oitylo, Areopoli and the Diros caverns. The village of Kalamitsi, just outside Kardamili was, in his later years, the principal home of Patrick Leigh Fermor and his wife Joan. Patrick was an English writer who was made an honorary citizen of the village for his participation in the Greek Resistance during World War II, especially in Crete. He died in hospital in 2011 the day after returning to his other home in Dumbleton in England. The ashes of the writer Bruce Chatwin were scattered near a Byzantine chapel above the village in 1989. Climate Kardamili, like much of Greece, experiences a very mild, subtropical Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Snow is almost unknown in the town itself, only falling a few times per century. Snow is, however, common in the mountains above Kardamili, with the Profitis Ilias typically remaining snow capped until early June. Winter rainfall in the area is often heavy, with spectacular flooding in the Viros gorge occurring every few years. In summer, by contrast, rain is scarce. Summer thunderstorms are exceptionally rare, bringing short, heavy downpours. Summertime temperatures usually range around 90‚Äì95¬∞F (32‚Äì35¬∞C), but heat waves with temperatures above 100¬∞F (38¬∞C) are common. The cooling Meltemi wind which blows across much of Greece is largely blocked by the mountains of the area, resulting in unusually calm seas which are often lake-like in the morning, before the sea breeze kicks up. Spring and Fall are warm to cool with changeable weather. Heavy hailstorms are known to strike the area in early spring and mid fall, sometimes causing damage to the local olive crop, as the olives or flowers are knocked out of their trees by falling hailstones. Global warming and climate change are especially felt in the area, with summers becoming more tropical ‚Äì featuring higher humidity with occasional afternoon thunderstorms and warmer nights. Winters are becoming warmer and drier. Due to these climatic changes, tropical plants such as mango, avocado, lychee, and plumeria are becoming a more common sight in the area, giving the town an exotic and lush feel. At night, the town often smells of these new tropical flowers and jasmine, as well as eucalyptus, as light mountain breezes blow the smells through the town. The following is climate data for nearby Kalamata. It is important to note that winter low temperatures tend to be a bit higher than those of Kalamata as the Taygetos block much of the northerly winds which bring cold air down from the rest of Europe. View of Kardamyli at dusk Geography Kardamili sits at the foot of the Taygetus mountains on the coast of the Messenian Bay. Much of the town sits on the remnants of a prehistoric lava flow, the remains of which can be seen as the lava rock outcrops which separate many of the local beaches from one another. The local beaches stand out from those in other areas of the world for the remarkably round stones of which they are made up. Nowhere else in the world is it possible to find smooth, often spherical stones on a beach, and the phenomenon has been subject to multiple studies done to find the cause of such a unique occurrence.[needs citation] The nearest places are Kampos to the North and Proastio to the southeast. History Kardamili is one of the oldest settlements in the Peloponnese, with its current name being mentioned in the Iliad, the epic poem by ancient Greek writer Homer. Many of the townspeople can trace their lineage back to either famed clans of the area (as in the Mourtzinos and Troupakis clans), or the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Palaiologos, one of whose descendants (Dimitri Palaiologos) settled in the region. The descendants of Dimitris Palaiologos typically have the last name \\"Dimitreas\\", meaning \\"son of Dimitri'.

It was Universal's 116th serial (and the 48th with sound) of their total of output of 137. The serial is one of the three serials starring \\"The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys\\" who were under contract to Universal at the time. The plot of Junior G-Men is a pre-World War II G-Man story about fifth columnists in the United States, with the FBI joining forces with youth to save the country. Rainey 2010, p. 130. Plot A group of saboteurs called the \\"Order of the Flaming Torch\\" who are trying to undermine the \\"social order\\" of the United States kidnaps several prominent scientists, including Colonel Robert Barton (Russell Hicks), the father of Billy Barton (Billy Halop), the leader of a group of young local street toughs. When FBI Agent Jim Bradford (Phillip Terry) investigates the mysterious disappearances, Billy is reluctant to help the authorities. Billy's gang team up with the FBI and the youthful \\"Junior G-Men\\", led by Harry Trent (Kenneth Howell) in order to stop the saboteurs. The criminal gang led by a man called Brand (Cy Kendall), calls themselves \\"The Order of the Flaming Torch\\". They are intent on destroying important military programs. The enemy agents become aware that they boys are on their trail and set a trap. When Billy and Harry are captured, they find a way to signal to their friends, and are rescued. \\"The Order of the Flaming Torch\\" is after the inventor of a new aerial torpedo. Billy and Harry go to the local airfield and hide on one of the inventor's aircraft. When the pilot is knocked out by one of Brand's men, the boys struggle to regain control of the aircraft. Finally successful, Harry, a licensed pilot, takes over and flies to safety. Learning that the enemy agents are holed up in an old warehouse where scientists including Colonel Barton is held, Billy and Harry try to free Barton, who has a secret formula for an explosive. Managing to send a message out from a radio room, the boys are saved when FBI agents overrun the warehouse. Billy is finally reunited with his father, and becomes a full-fledged member of the Junior G-Men.

He was the first director of the British Civil Service College. Grebenik was born in Kyiv a few months after the establishment of the Ukrainian SSR. He was the only son and elder child of Jewish parents Schulim Grebenik (1887‚Äì1972), estate agent, and his wife, Lea Helene (n√©e Lopatizkaya; 1894‚Äì1985), a qualified lawyer. His birth was not registered with the Soviet government because his mother didn't want him to be naturalised and thought that this was mandatory. He had a sister, Renata Rosalie. The family moved to Danzig in 1920, then to Berlin, and finally, after the rise of Adolf Hitler, to England in 1933. Grebenik could speak several European languages but none like a native. All his life he was known as Grebby, because he never liked the association with eugenics born by the name 'Eugene'. He attended the Xaverian College Catholic high school in Brighton. Grebenik went to the London School of Economics in 1935 aged sixteen, and graduated with a first-class degree in economics (with statistics and demography as his special subject) at eighteen. He earned the Farr medal and prize. After a brief spell working in the City of London, he returned to the LSE as research assistant to Arthur Bowley, and then moved to Bristol to work with H. A. Shannon. Their book, The Population of Bristol, was published in 1943. Rejected by the army due to his foreign birth, Grebenik returned to the LSE in 1940 and graduated MSc in 1941. Promoted to lecturer in statistics in 1944, Grebenik was seconded to the Admiralty for the final year of World War II as a statistical officer, where he worked with William Brass. He was then seconded for a year to the secretariat of the Royal Commission on Population. He was naturalised on 23 November 1946 and shortly afterwards married Virginia Barker. Grebenik worked with David Glass, editor of Population Studies, from its inception in 1947‚Äîand continued to be associated with the journal as joint and then sole editor for fifty years. He was promoted to reader in demography at the LSE in 1949. His work with Glass on the 1946 family census, published in two volumes as The Trend and Pattern of Fertility in Great Britain (1954), was a landmark in cohort analysis. In 1954 Grebenik was appointed professor of social studies at the University of Leeds. In 1970 Grebenik was appointed the first principal of the Civil Service College at Sunningdale. He left the college in 1976 to conduct research at the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, working with Abraham Manie Adelstein and John Fox, where he remained until he retired in 1984. Grebenik was secretary-general of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population from 1963 to 1973. He organised three of the IUSSP's four-yearly general population conferences, including the one held in Belgrade in 1965 in conjunction with the second United Nations world population conference. He was also president of the British Society for Population Studies from 1979 to 1981. Among other honours, In 1997, he was the first recipient of the Olivia Schieffelin Nordberg award from the Population Council in New York. He and Virginia had three children: Michael, Peter and Catherine.

Described by CBC News reporter Harry Forestell as a \\"meeting between Foreign Policy and Vanity Fair\\", the magazine aims to provide a global perspective on international affairs, business, culture, design, and fashion. The magazine is edited by Andrew Tuck. The magazine was founded and based in London on February 15, 2007. In September 2014, Br√ªl√© sold a minority stake in Monocle magazine to Japanese publisher Nikkei Inc. The deal valued Monocle at about U.S. $115 million, although the size of Nikkei's investment was undisclosed. In December 2014, Monocle launched a new annual publication called The Forecast, intended to fill the gap between the Dec./Jan. and February issues of Monocle. The Escapist, a travel-minded annual magazine, was introduced in July 2015 and focuses on in- depth reportage of 10 cities around the world.

It is located in the towns of Bethlehem and Lincoln, near the northeastern corner of the Pemigewasset Wilderness. The center of the notch is traversed by hiking trails and is approximately from the nearest road. Zealand Pond, Zealand Falls, and the Zealand Falls hut are located near the height of land. Similarly to Crawford Notch to the east, the main body of Zealand Notch comprises a steep-walled, U-shaped valley running southwards from the height of land. Whitewall Brook flows through the bottom of the notch, reaching the North Fork of the Pemigewasset River at the south end of the notch. Water from Whitewall Brook flows via branches and the main stem of the Pemigewasset to the Merrimack River and ultimately the Gulf of Maine. North of the notch's height of land, the Zealand River flows north to the Ammonoosuc River near the village of Twin Mountain, with the streamflow eventually reaching the Connecticut River and turning south again to ultimately reach Long Island Sound. The notch lies between Whitewall Mountain (3,405 ft./1,038 m.) to the east and Zeacliff (approx. 3,600 ft./1,097 m.), an eastern arm of Zealand Mountain, to the west. The Appalachian Trail traverses Zealand Notch. From the west, the trail (paired with the Twinway trail) descends from Zeacliff past Zealand Falls (a long series of smooth granite ledges ending in a drop over vertical granite) and Zealand Falls Hut to the center of the notch. Here the Twinway ends, and the Appalachian Trail turns south and follows the Ethan Pond Trail along an old railroad grade through the notch, along the side of Whitewall Mountain, exiting the south end of the notch and continuing east towards Crawford Notch. Other trails in Zealand Notch include the Zealand Trail approaching along the Zealand River from the north, the Lend-a-Hand Trail which reaches Zealand Falls Hut from Mount Hale to the northwest, and the Zeacliff Trail, which descends from the top of Zeacliff straight down the notch wall to Whitewall Brook and the Ethan Pond Trail.

Built to protect the mouth of the River Seine, it includes an imposing square crenellated tower. In the 18th century it was transformed into a residence. History The Auricher fiefdom was created by the Duke of Normandy for a family who got the name Aurichier from a place down in the Seine Valley and built the castle with a chapel (Sainte-Honorine) on top of a cliff overlooking the Seine. The square keep was surrounded by a trapezoidal enceinte, defended in the 13th century by three square towers. In 1360 it was partly destroyed on the orders of officials from Harfleur. Rebuilt later, it was taken by the English in 1415 at the same time as Harfleur. The Crespin family was dispossessed by Henry V. Some French sources state that Henry gave the castle to John Falstaff, the fictional Shakespearean character, but this is almost certainly meant to be Sir John Fastolf. In 1434, the castle and its associated possessions and privileges were given to the Duke of Bedford. In 1449, the estates reverted to the Crespins and later, by legacy, went to the Br√©z√© family in 1488 and finally to the O family in 1539. In 1604, the Orcher land was decreed to be the property of Georges Laillet seigneur of Auricher, and consisted of castle, fortress and house covered with slate. In 1632 the estates became the property of the Potier family. Thomas Planterose took possession in 1735 and over the next ten years set about transforming the castle. He employed master masons Fran√ßois de la Motte and Jacques Lesueur, both from Picardy, and a master plasterer from Caudebec-en-Caux, Courtel]. The elegant woodwork was created by a carpenter from Le Havre, Le Roux. The two north towers and the ruins of the great keep in the north-west were demolished, along with the curtain walls. In 1795, following the division of the estate with the death of Madame de Melmont, the property was described as a \\"dwelling house castle and accessories and a farm of 145 acres\\". In the 19th century, the estate became the property of the Rochechouart family, who had the castle, notably the tower, restored in 1857 by the architect P. Philippon. The castle grounds are open to the public all year. The Ch√¢teau d'Orcher is listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

Events The bombings occurred three days before general elections, in which incumbent Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar's PP was defeated. Immediately after the bombing, leaders of the PP claimed evidence indicated that the Basque separatist organization ETA was responsible for the bombings. Such accusation led to a result which favours to the PP's chances of being re-elected.Lago, I. (Universidad Pompeu Fabra) Del 11-M al 14-M: Los mecanismos del cambio electoral. Pgs 12‚Äì13.

After 21 months of investigation, judge Juan del Olmo ruled Moroccan national Jamal Zougam guilty of physically carrying out the attack. The September 2007 sentence established no known mastermind nor direct al-Qaeda link. Accuracy of government statements The conservative PP government was accused of falsely blaming ETA for the attacks. The day of the attacks, police officials informed the Government that explosives usually used by ETA were found at the blast sites. This, along with other suspicious circumstances, led the PP to suspect ETA involvement. Although there was no direct or indirect evidence from the investigation of the bombing pointing to ETA involvement, the group had been caught with a large amount of explosives some months previously, which looked like preparations for a big strike. According to a report of the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center (ESISC), the same morning of the bombings the Spanish Intelligence Services and Policy had concluded that the author of the massacre was an Islamist terrorist group, but they had been ordered by the government to deny this Islamist attribution and insist that the ETA were the only suspects,Les attentats de Madrid.

On one hand, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar was aggressively opposed to any dialogue with ETA, and based most of his campaign on the threat of terrorism (the September 11 attacks in New York reinforced his view of the war against the terrorists). On the other hand, Aznar's friendship with U.S. president George W. Bush led him to support the 2003 invasion of Iraq against the views of the overwhelming majority of the population (resulting in the biggest demonstrations ever seen in Spain since the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s).Noam Chomsky, The Iraq War and Contempt for Democracy. This left Aznar in a complicated situation: if Basque terrorists were proven to be responsible for the massacre, it would favour the PP's campaign, but if an Islamic group appeared to cause the blast, people might blame him for earning himself (and Spain) enemies. The Summary of the Judicial Enquiry concluded that the decision to attack Madrid was taken after, and as a result of, the invasion of Iraq. Nevertheless, The New Yorker claimed the decision was taken before 9/11Lawrence Wright, A Reporter at Large: The Terror Web, The New Yorker, 2 August 2004: \\"One of the most sobering pieces of information to come out of the investigation of the 11 March bombings is that the planning for the attacks may have begun nearly a year before 9/11\\" according to an Italian police report.  Explosives used in the attacks  In the immediate aftermath of the train bombings it was suspected that the explosive used in the bombs may have been Titadine, as initial suspicions on responsibility for the bombings focused on ETA and this explosive had been used by them on occasions in the past. As evidence emerged from the investigation attention on the explosive used switched to a brand of dynamite known as Goma-2. Analysis of samples from the explosion sites carried out by a member of the bomb disposal squad (TEDAX) following the bombings did not produce a definitive result. The analyst concerned later testified in the trial of those accused of committing the bombings. She stated that the only thing she could identify in these tests were generic components of dynamite. Later in 2004, in his appearance before the parliamentary committee of inquiry, Juan Jesus S√°nchez Manzano (the head of the TEDAX) stated that traces of nitroglycerine had been detected in the samples recovered after the bombings.Declaration (Spanish) \\"Sessions of the parliamentary commission of investigation: 4th page first column\\"\\"Audio file with the declarations of S√°nchez Manzano\\" He would later retract this statement before the investigating magistrate in charge of the case and emphasised that he was not an expert in explosives. The statement by S√°nchez Manzano led supporters of the idea that ETA was involved in the bombings to question whether the explosive used in the bombs had been Goma 2 ECO. Nitroglycerine is not a component of Goma 2 ECO. In the run up to the trial of those accused, the court ordered that fresh tests be carried out on the samples recovered from the trains and on remains of explosive recovered from different sites connected to the bombings. These tests were carried out by specialists appointed from the security services, the defence and other parties to the accusation. The judges ordered that video and audio recordings be made of these tests. The results of these tests were also inconclusive concerning the samples taken from the explosion sites. Nitroglycerine was detected in one of these samples, and the presence of dinitrotoluene (DNT) was also detected. This has led to claims that the explosive used could have been Titadine. However, also detected in the same sample was dibutyl phthalate (DBP), which is a component of Goma 2 ECO but not of titadine. Several other samples from the explosion sites also revealed the joint presence of DNT and DBP. Tests were carried out on a sample of Titadine. In addition the presence of nitroglycerine and DNT was also detected in samples of Goma 2 ECO that had been recovered from sites associated with the bombings. The discovery of these different components led to suggestions that there could have been some accidental contamination of the samples and explosive remains, although a definitive cause of such contamination has not been established. Entire cartridges, or partial remains of cartridges, of Goma 2 ECO were recovered from the apartment in Legan√©s where 7 suspects of the bombings died following an explosion, the only unexploded bomb, a Renault Kangoo van found near Alcal√° de Henares station on the day of the bombings, and the device that was left by the high speed railway line connecting Madrid and Seville. The only explosive positively identified in any site connected to the bombings has been Goma 2 ECO and the sentence in the trial concluded that it was likely that the bombs contained this explosive or a mixture of it with its predecessor product Goma 2 EC. Potential prevention of the bombings Some of the alleged Islamist perpetrators had reportedly been under surveillance by the Spanish police since January 2003. According to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, 24 of the 29 alleged perpetrators were informers and/or controlled by the Cuerpo Nacional de Polic√≠a, Civil Guard and Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (\\"National Centre for Intelligence\\") from the time before the attacks.Un inspector asegura que persegu√≠an a varios de los acusados desde enero de 2003, ABC:An inspector assures that several accused were being pursued since January 2003 Spain: State Funeral For Madrid Bombing Victims Gathers World Leaders: The main suspect remains Moroccan Jamal Zougam, who allegedly had close ties to Islamist militants and who has been under watch by Spanish, French, and Moroccan agents since 2001Spanish investigators confident The lead suspect is Jamal Zougam, who allegedly has close ties with Islamist militants and has been under watch by Spanish, French and Moroccan agents since 2001 at least.11-M: ¬øCulpa in vigilando?

This group seems to have had very tenuous connection with al-Qaeda but with the aim of acting on its behalf. Shortly after the bombings, the group was completely dismantled by the Spanish police and the core members died in an apparent suicide explosion when they were surrounded in the nearby town of Legan√©s. ‚Äì Madrid bombing suspects (BBC News) The Madrid bombings have led to the sharp political and social differences between the parties in Spain being accentuated. This stands in sharp contrast to other large-scale terrorist attacks such as those in New York and London, which galvanized society and political forces towards unity. Spain's political division is exemplified by the accusation of members of the Partido Popular and several conservative media outlets regarding who was responsible for the bombings and whether the attacks were for political gain.Fear or Falsehood? Framing the 3/11 terrorist attacks in Madrid and electoral accountability (Real Instituto Elcano) Some of these sources initially supported the hypothesis that ETA was behind the attacks. These groups have focused their investigation on unexplained details and inconsistencies in the Summary Report and have expressed skepticism about the truthfulness and neutrality of the evidence presented. Since the bombings, the chief opposition party, PP (which lost power in the election in the immediate aftermath of the bombings), together with conservative media in Spain, have overtly argued the possibility that the Socialist party, the police, the Spanish, French, and Moroccan secret services, and, of course, ETA, had a role in organisation of the outrage.Cultura contra la guerra organiza una manifestaci√≥n contra el PP frente a su sede de la calle G√©nova (Libertad Digital) Not all conservative media outlets were involved in this campaign. There is a distinct difference between those who believe that the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) used it for political gain (as it had access to information, either from France or through links to the Police, used to criticise the government in the aftermath of the bombings), and those who believe a consortium of the ETA, some groups in the State Security Forces (possibly related to the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci√≥n (GAL)), the Moroccan secret services, and the PSOE may have had a role either in organising the bombings or blocking official investigation.Los agujeros negros del 11-M El Mundo, 19 April 2004. Article defending a number of conspiracy theories related to the bombings. The first group includes the Newspaper ABC, while the second group includes the Radio Station COPE and newspapers La Raz√≥n and El Mundo.Spain‚Äôs 11-M and the right‚Äôs revenge (Open Democracy) This second group claims the official version is more than questionable and that the truth is still unknown. They have coupled such claims with doubts about the legitimacy of the current government, which they oppose ideologically. An attempt to link ETA to the bombings occurred in May 2006, when El Mundo published on its front page that a business card of the Basque firm Mondrag√≥n Cooperative Corporation (MCC) had been found in the van used by the terrorists. This piece of evidence, discovered by the policemen who found the van, was not found in the numerous police reports.La furgoneta Kangoo del 11-M ten√≠a una tarjeta del Grupo Mondrag√≥n en el salpicadero (El Mundo) El Mundo's rationale was that Mondrag√≥n had no connection with ETA but could point to ETA, just as the Qur'anic cassette pointed to Islamic extremists. The Spanish police later asserted that it was not a business card, but the cover of a music CD of the popular Spanish 1980s rock group Orquesta Mondrag√≥n. The CD with its case was found in a pile of various other music CDs. The rear of the cover had apparently been used by the legitimate proprietor to warn people when he parked in the middle of the street, since it had a handwritten message that read \\"I am coming back immediately\\".Las √∫ltimas exclusivas de Pedro J. y Jimenez Losantos sobre el 11-M son desmontadas por la polic√≠a (La Rep√∫blica) Nevertheless, El Mundo continued to insist on the existence of an MCC card in the van. The Spanish police also asserted that a card from \\"Gr√°ficas Bilba√≠nas\\" (\\"Bilbao printing\\", a print shop located in Madrid) found in the van was the source of the alleged confusion. Alleged destruction of evidence The passenger cars damaged by the explosions were supposedly destroyed to hide evidence 4 days after the explosion and the corpses found in the Legan√©s flat were also supposedly buried without autopsy. Additionally, in December 2004, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero claimed that the PP government erased all of the computer files related to the Madrid bombings, leaving only the documents on paper.

The bomb has been called \\"the bomb that dismounted the PP version of ETA\\", and was known to Spanish sources as \\"Mochila de Vallecas\\", \\"Backpack from Vallecas\\", because its discovery was announced in the Vallecas Police Station on the morning of 12 March. The thirteenth bomb's validity as an exhibit is disputed. Presence of the bomb on the train On the morning of the bombings, the trains were double-checked by the EOD police to be sure that no unexploded devices were present. The thirteenth bomb was not found at this time. The only EOD policeman who remembered handling a heavy bag (the thirteenth bomb weighed around 11 kilograms (24 lbs)) that morning in El Pozo station asserted positively that the heavy bag he handled in the train station did not contain the bomb. Correct handling of the evidence A Spanish police report concluded that the bomb could have been manipulated by unidentified persons in Ifema (in Spanish, \\"pudo ser manipulada por personas no identificadas en el Ifema\\"), which was the Madrid exhibition center where objects found in the trains were temporarily stored. While DNA from an unidentified male was found on or in the bag, Spanish police asserted that the 'chain of custody' was unbroken.Los jefes policiales encargados del 11-M afirman que la bolsa bomba siempre estuvo bajo control ¬∑ ELPA√çS.com and the PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, asserted in March 2006 that he had no doubts about the validity of this police exhibit. In December 2006 El Mundo claimed that one of the policeman in the Vallecas Police Station during the alleged discovery of the thirteenth bomb was under investigation for his alleged participation in a plot to sell illegal Goma 2-ECO, and in the assassination of a petty thief.

Sky Raiders has little in common with Universal‚Äôs other early-1940s espionage outings like Sea Raiders or Junior G-Men, although the serial is often lumped in together as if it is part of a series. Rainey 2010, p. 120. Plot Former World War I ace pilot Captain Bob Dayton, (Donald Woods) is the owner of Sky Raiders, Inc., an aircraft company. Dayton has designed a bombsight and a new high speed fighter aircraft, the \\"Sky Raider\\". Dayton recruits young Tim Bryant (Billy Halop), a member of Air Youth of America, to help him. Nazi agent Felix Lynx (Eduardo Ciannelli) attempts to steal these designs for his own country. Lynx is determined to seize this valuable new aircraft, with the help of his female accomplice Innis Clair (Jacqueline Dalya) and of a criminal named John KAne who happens to be a perfect double for Dayton. All attempts, however, to steal the fighter aircraft prototype, fail. Dayton's new bombsight is being tested in Hawaii, and Lynx intercepts a Sikorsky S-45 flying boat on the way to Honolulu. After it is shot down, Dayton and his secretary Mary Blake (Kathryn Adams) who were on board, were rescued by a government cutter. Lieutenant Carry (Robert Armstrong) and Tim meet the survivors but find that Lynx has sent his henchmen to finish the job. The foreign agents are killed when they hit an oncoming truck. Mary announces that she has become Mrs. Dayton.

Famous aviator Bob Dayton (Donald Woods) hires a bright member of the Air Youth of America, Tim (Halop), to help him finalize a hush-hush project: a new type of fighter plane and bombsight. This being 1941, plenty of enemy agents are after the invention, including the nefarious Felix Lynx (Eduardo Cianelli). It takes Dayton, Tim, and the co-owner of Sky Raiders, Inc., Lieutenant Ed Carey (Robert Armstrong) 12 breathless chapters before they are able to defeat the enemy.

On the north is an open valley, and the modern buildings extend along a spur which runs out west from the watershed. The ground is rocky on the hills, but the valleys are arable land. There are remains of an ancient castle in the village, and other fragments. A church is said once to have existed here, and the ruins to the west show that the town was once much larger.

According to Palestinian sources, a 30-year-old Palestinian man from the town of As-Samu' sustained multiple bodily injuries when a group of settlers beat him and dragged him to the nearby settlement outpost of Asael. The settlers then tied him to an electricity pole where the assault continued. Culture A headdress or 'money hat' (wuqayat al-darahem) from as-Samu (c. 1840s, with later additions) is exhibited at the British Museum. The caption notes that the headdress was worn in the 19th century and early 20th century during the wedding ceremony, especially for the 'going out to the well' ceremony when the bride appeared in public as a married woman for the first time.

A report by Phoenix newspaper Arizona Republic indicated the fight involved 1,000 students, and the incident reportedly spilled into neighborhoods surrounding the school. The incident reportedly happened in the aftermath of a shooting that injured a Hispanic senior student was a member of a Bloods gang. The suspect in the shooting was reportedly an African American Crips gang member. No guns or knives were used during the riot, but it involved other weapons such as metal pipes and tree branches. Dozens were reportedly injured, and the incident resulted in the arrest of 18 people. School security, along with Phoenix Police Department and Arizona Department of Public Safety officers, joined forces to separate the African American and Hispanic students, and stop the riot at the school. Overcrowding at the school was seen, at least by school officials at the time, as a cause for the incident.  2009  In February 2009, a riot involving up to 300 people either fighting or cheering took place, as school was letting out. A school resource officer, as well as a Phoenix Police officer, were assaulted, and in the end, 40 officers were called to subdue the riot. 12 people, including 10 juveniles and 2 adults, were arrested.

This technique creates statistical and graphical models of the people, tasks, groups, knowledge and resources of organizational systems. It is based on social network theory and more specifically, dynamic network analysis. ONA is a growing trend in the field of People Analytics, especially around the concept of understanding Diversity and Inclusion, Innovation, as well as Employee Performance and motivations. In this Network-driven age, leaders are increasingly focused on understanding relationships that drive behavior and how that impacts the emotions and sentiment of the employees within an organization. \\"Organizational network analysis (ONA) can provide an x-ray into the inner workings of an organization ‚Äî a powerful means of making invisible patterns of information flow and collaboration in strategically important groups visible.\\"  Applications  ONA can be used in a variety of ways by managers, consultants, and executives.  Network visualizations  There are several tools that allow managers to visually depict their employee networks. Most of the tools are built specifically for researchers and academics who study Network theory, but are relatively inexpensive to use, as long as the leaders are well-versed on how to capture the information, feed it into the tool in the correct formats, and understand how to \\"read\\" and translate the network graphs into business decisions.  Diversity and Inclusivity Index  One of the major pain points facing companies today is understanding how to motivate and retain top talent in the company who are from diverse backgrounds, race, or ethnicity. There are several tools to ensure diverse talent is hired or recruited; however, very few solutions to help leaders ensure their newly hired diverse workforce is consistently engaged, integrated, and included within the team. Leaders depend on their team's inclusive culture and team dynamics to fill this gap; however, building and maintaining an inclusive culture is a laborious task that requires constant vigilance and tracking. This is where an ONA tool helps managers develop and track the level of inclusion within their teams, but also proactively highlights gaps and vulnerabilities within the team. ONA can track how many employees have been hired by the company and also how they interact with each other. This ability to track employee relationships gives leaders the data-driven transparency they need to ensure their company culture is in fact being deployed and represented accurately across all layers of their organization.  Innovation Gauge  Several recent studies and research has highlighted that 'Psychological Safety' is the marker for an innovative team. This has been studied and published first by Google, in their Project Aristotle work as well as highlighted in New York Times and other research publications. Amy Edmondson is the preeminent scholar and researcher in this field who has worked across various industries to identify the benefits and even the characteristics of 'Psychological Safety' in teams. ONA is now increasingly being used in this context to analyze the relationships developed within a given team, and for understanding how that team works as a unit to create this psychological safety for its members. This technique is more thorough than the traditional surveys, and can more objectively measure the emotional impact that colleague have on each other, and help leaders understand whether there are sufficient connections that can build the type of positive emotions necessary to create innovative teams.  Employee Engagement  Engagement surveys and other such culture surveys have become a mainstay of the workplace. However, one of the largest complaints from such surveys are that once managers see the results, often the aggregated sentiments of their employees, they are unsure of next steps and actions. Organizational Network Analysis, when combined with such engagement surveys, however change the way that leaders use and leverage these results. Because ONA allows managers to see the context behind the sentiments, they can actually understand how to correct or sustain these results. For example, if a company's engagement survey said 30% of the employees felt they are inadequately trained for their jobs, a manager would be perhaps inclined to either do nothing, or invest more in comprehensive training programs. However, doing an ONA alongside this might reveal to managers that employees are unhappy with training because they have limited access to institutional knowledge at the company. Then, instead of a training program, managers might simply work on ensuring their top knowledge hubs share their knowledge broadly, and have a longer, more sustainable improvement to the team's level of information and training.

During Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, troops of the XLVII Motorized Corps under his command executed the criminal Commissar Order, prompting Lemelsen to complain: \\"Soon the Russians will get to hear about the countless corpses lying along the routes taken by our soldiers (...). The result will be that the enemy will hide in the woods and fields and continue to fight--and we shall lose countless comrades\\". Early life Born in 1888 in Berlin, Lemelsen joined the army of Imperial Germany as an Fahnenjunker (officer cadet) in the artillery and later participated in World War I. Serving in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany, he commanded the Artillery Lehr Regiment in 1934 and from the following year taught at infantry school. In March 1938, Lemelsen was given command of the 29th Infantry Division. World War II Lemelsen took part in the Invasion of Poland; his division was involved in the Massacre in Ciepiel√≥w of 8 September 1939.

It is located eleven kilometers north-east from the city of Nuremberg and 23 kilometers east from Erlangen and is the headquarters of Schwan-Stabilo. Geography=Location It is in the Sebalder Reichswald, the forest north to Nuremberg and is on a ridge. The Gr√ºndlach, a side river of the Regnitz, flows through the village of Heroldsberg. Municipality It contains Gro√ügeschaidt, Kleingeschaidt and the villages of Heroldsberg, consisting of Heroldsberg, Johannisthal and Hundsm√ºhle. Surrounding Municipalities It is surrounded by Eckental, Lauf an der Pegnitz, Nuremberg and Kalchreuth.  History  Heroldsberg's history goes back to the 11th century but it was first mentioned in 1225. Later on in 1387 the territory was sold to the Nuremberg patrician family Geuder in whose possession the lordship of Heroldsberg was for over 400 years, rendering them imperial knights with the name Geuder von Heroldsberg, and raised in rank to Bavarian barons in 1822. The Geuders increased their wealth through long-distance trade, namely with spices and cloths shipped to Cologne in the 14th century, and run commercial establishments in Venice in the late 14th century and in Frankfurt am Main and Flanders in the early 15th century. Around 1418 they also did financial business in Paris and were involved in mining companies. It was them who built the four manors, the so-called green, red, white and yellow castles, and the fortified church at the village's market square. Famous painter Albrecht D√ºrer, a friend of councillor and Schulthei√ü Martin Geuder III (1455‚Äì1532), made the first graphical depiction of the village of Heroldsberg in 1510, with Geuder's newly built Red Castle in the foreground. It is still today owned by Geuder's descendants.

In 1796 the Geuder family lost the fiefdom and the territory became Prussian, though in the Napoleonic Wars it was under French administration for four years. Ever since 1810 Heroldsberg belongs to Bavaria. After World War II around 1,700 Heimatvertriebene, ethnic Germans who were forced to leave their eastern-European homecountries after the second World War, settled in Heroldsberg. Since the Bavarian territorial reform in 1978 the villages of Gro√ügeschaidt and Kleingeschaidt are part of the community.http://www.heroldsberg.de/start/ortsgeschichte Coat of arms The coat of arms of Heroldsberg shows a golden lion's head, surrounded by three silver stars on a blue background.

The inhabitants are mostly of Berber origin. Fishing, tourism, and the production of Argan oil being the main source of income. The developing tourism industry promises to increase the wealth of the area.  Geography  Taghazout lays at the Moroccan atlantic coast 19 km north of Agadir and 152 km south of Essaouira. Inland it is surrounded by the western foothills of the High Atlas.  Demography  The inhabitants of earlier times were exclusively Berbers from the Ida Oufella tribe, but due to the increasing modernization (connection to the electricity, water and telephone network) and the associated construction boom in the surroundings of Agadir, many newcomers from other regions of Morocco have joined. Moroccan Arabic is the main language, but French and English are also spoken. The regional Berber dialect is still being used in the hinterland.  History  The ruins of buyirdn (la Madrague) Like almost all Berber villages in southern Morocco, virtually nothing is known about the earlier history of Taghazout; oral traditions only report of clashes of the united Berber tribes with the Portuguese in the 16th century. The Berber inhabitants originally resided in the foothills of the surrounding mountains and used the village purely as a place to store their fishing equipment. As the Spanish increased their hold on the area in the 19th Century, factories and Mosques were built in order to house the Berber people and the village grew into a larger community. In a similar fashion to Calangute beach in Goa India and Kuta on the island of Bali Indonesia, a beach just south of the village became famous in the late 1960s as a destination for young people to base themselves while exploring southern Morocco. On occasion, several hundred would reside in tents, makeshift buildings, and camper vans. However, the camp has been banned and instead replaced with fully equipped hotels and resorts for tourists. Since 1992 Taghazout is the center of an independent municipality, which also includes several villages in the hinterland. Anchor's - pumping  Tourism  Tourism is an important source of income of locals. Though, they are worrying about the urbanization projects in process (Taghazout Bay). The Moroccan Minister of Tourism underlined the importance of the ecological and sustainable component adopted as part of the project, for the benefit of the local populations of Taghazout and Tamraght, through the construction of public facilities and of income generating activities and jobs. The project is supposed to attract 300.000 more tourists in the current period (from 2015 to 2020). In addition to its beaches - perfect for surfing and surf beginnings -, Taghazout attract a lot of tourists looking for calm and tranquility, far from the crowded destinations like Marrakech, Agadir, etc. Taghazout is also a good village to stay in to do other activities, like Paradise Valley trip, visit Argan oil corporations, camel riding on the beach, Yoga retreat, paddle boarding, Kayak, etc. Beaches Abouda beach (27 km from Agadir) There are several beaches north of Agadir, which all offer a good alternative to the local beach in town. The setting of these beaches can be most attractive, with mountains on all sides, yet with a wide and clean beach with all necessary amenities. The largest and popular are: Tamawanza (12 km), Aitswal Beach, Imouran (17 km),Taghazout beach (19 km), Du lkhmiss 20, Bouyirdn (21 km), Timzguida allal (22 km), Imiouadar (27 km), Aghroud (30 km). Surfing is now the common theme for visitors. Morocco is famous for its long right hand point breaks; thoroughly consistent and generally uncrowded. The most famous of which is a little to the north. In the right conditions this point can take you on a 2 km ride, starting at Anchor Point, joining up with Hash Point and ending on the beach break at Panorama's. There are several other beaches in and around the area making it an ideal destination for all levels of surfing skill. The waves work best between September to April especially for advanced surfers, receiving similar conditions to that of mainland Europe, but with the warm waters of the Moroccan Atlantic up to 21 degrees.  Taghazout Bay  The site Taghazout-Argana Bay is 15 kilometres north of Agadir. It is intended to become the first seaside resort in Morocco, 300 km from Marrakesh, the first cultural and tourist centre of the country and 170 kilometres from the city of Essaouira. Taghazout Bay is part of the Moroccan national tourism strategy ‚ÄòVision 2020‚Äô. It is expected (September 2018) to provide the implementation of 8000 beds (5800 hotel), with a closer and more environmentally friendly tourism development, \\"Taghazout eco-resort.\\" It further provides for a village of surfers, a village green holiday, camping with international standards, an 18-hole golf course, cafes, restaurants, shops and galleries.: Document Taghazoutbay  See also  * Plan Azur References External links Category:Populated places in Agadir-Ida Ou Tanane Prefecture Category:Rural communes of Souss-Massa Category:Fishing villages Category:Beaches of Morocco Category:Outdoor recreation ","title":"Taghazout"},{"id":"10141243","title":"2005 Alpine Skiing World Cup ‚Äì Women's Super G"},{"id":"10141245","text":"Vladimir Bo≈æoviƒá (, ; born 13 November 1981) is a professional footballer who plays for Su≈°ica.

A PVT involves observation of the administration of the election, the process of voting and of counting of ballots at the polling stations, collection of official polling station results and independent tabulation of these results, parallel to election authorities. A PVT is also referred to as a Quick Count. Origin Organizers from the Philippine National Citizen Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL) are widely recognized as the pioneers of the quick count, or parallel vote tabulation (PVT) for emerging democracies. During a 1986 Presidential election, NAMFREL attempted to mirror the official count of all 90,000 polling stations. They performed a remarkable task in collecting data from the majority of polling stations, providing evidence to help uncover the massive vote counting fraud attempted by Marcos supporters. Methodology Sample-based election observation such as the PVT is grounded in statistics, namely the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers. When a group of observers has access to an official list of polling units (provided by the government or independent election commission), they can deploy a representative random sample of observers from their organization (or election-monitoring coalition of organizations) to polling stations who observe the process of the election and the posted vote count at each polling unit. Following the voting period, observers then transmit the information that they collect back to a central data center for analysis. This data can then be used to make independent and statistically-backed estimates of the vote-share per party or candidate, election turnout and conduct and administration of the election by the election management body. The approach is described in detail in the National Democratic Institute (NDI)'s The Quick Count and Election Observation. It is also briefly described in section 10B of the Handbook for Domestic Election Observers, published by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which is part of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

Zimbabwe 2008 Election The disputed Zimbabwean election held in March 2008, is another example where parallel vote tabulation played a significant (if not conclusive) role in the outcome. Following a concession gained by then President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa in the much-maligned process of \\"quiet diplomacy\\", the results at individual polling stations were displayed on the outside. MDC supporters took pictures, often with camera phones, and sent these to a central location (in Johannesburg), where the results were tabulated. The MDC claimed as a consequence of this process that their candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, had polled 50.3% of the vote, and that he was thus the outright winner of the election. A six-week hiatus followed, in which no new results were officially released by the Zimbabwean election authority. At the end of the process, it was announced that Mr. Tsvangirai had secured 48.6% of the votes, and that a run-off election would follow. Although no clear outcome was gained in that election, the parallel vote tabulation played a significant role in preventing outright electoral fraud.

With approximately 16,000 inhabitants, Saalfelden is the district's largest town and the third of the federal state after Salzburg and Hallein.  Geography  Although the Saalfelden area has always been the most populous of the historic Pinzgau region, the seat of the district administration is situated in the neighbouring town of Zell am See. Saalfelden Basin Saalfelden am Steinernen Meer lies at above sea level and its municipal area covers . The largest proportion of the municipality is formed by the Saalfelden Basin (Saalfeldner Becken) situated between the Northern Limestone Alps ranges of: * the Steinernes Meer high plateau to the north, forming the border with Germany * the Leogang Mountains and the Biberg to the west * the Hochk√∂nig massif and the Salzburg Slate Alps to the east. View over Saalfelden Basin To the south the basin is generally open, running into the Zell Basin (Zeller Becken) with Lake Zell and the Salzach river ‚Äì hence the term Zell-Saalfelden Basin Zeller-Saalfeldener Becken is also used for the whole valley ‚Äì and enables a view of the High Tauern, especially the prominent Kitzsteinhorn and Wiesbachhorn peaks. The two basins are separated by a barely discernible valley floor divide. This trough is one of the largest inner-Alpine basins. The main river in the basin is the Saalach. It rises in the upper Glemm Valley, empties into the basin south of Saalfelden and passes through it from south to north. A right tributary of the Saalach flowing through the borough of Saalfelden from east to west is the Urslau creek. A left tributary, the Leoganger Ache, empties into the Saalach from the west. In addition there are several smaller tributary streams. In the centre of the basin is the K√ºhb√ºhel (\\"cow-hill\\") which is a good . The only lake in the expansive basin is the man-made Ritzensee, excavated for leisure purposes. Other artificial ponds have been laid out primarily for angling and tourism. Subdivisions The Saalfelden municipality comprises the cadastral communities of Bergham, Farmach, Gerling, Haid, Hohlwegen, Lenzing, Lichtenberg, and Saalfelden proper. History Town centre with parish church in October 2008. Early archaeological findings in the Saalfelden Basin date back to the Neolithic Era. A continuous settlement is documented since the late Iron Age, when Celtic tribes moved into the region. From the 7th century AD onwards, Bavarians settled the area from the north. About 100 years later the estates of Salvet on the Saalach river were first mentioned in a register by the Bishops of Salzburg. While they became part of the Carolingian Empire, the lands were incorporated into the Frankish Pinzgau county. The Saalfelden estates were acquired by Archbishop Hartwig of Salzburg about 1000; and by the early 13th century, the whole Pinzgau region was part of the prince-bishops' lands. Saalfelden was first mentioned as a market town in the mid 14th century. It remained part of the Salzburg prince-archbishopric until its secularisation in 1803. With the Salzburg lands, Saalfelden finally fell to the Austrian Empire in 1816. It achieved town status in 2000.  Sport and leisure  Felix Gottwald Ski Jumping Stadium The Ritzensee and the adjacent Kollingwald forest are the recreation areas for Saalfelden's townsfolk. The lake is used in summer as a bathing lake and in winter for ice skating. Footpaths and trails are used in winter as cross country skiing routes. In the village of Uttenhofen there several ski jumps including those of the Felix Gottwald Ski Jumping Stadium and a centre for Nordic combination. Saalfelden earned fame in the langlauf and biathlon sports through its top athletes: Felix Gottwald, Simon Eder, Julian Eberhard and Tobias Eberhard.

There are a number of reasons for considering crown lengthening in a treatment plan. Commonly, the procedure is used to expose a greater amount of tooth structure for the purpose of subsequently restoring the tooth prosthetically.Takei, HH; Azzi, RR; Han, TJ: Preparation of the Periodontium for Restorative Dentistry. In Newman, MG; Takei, HH; Carranza, FA; editors: Carranza's Clinical Periodontology, 9th Edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 2002. page 945. However, other indications include accessing subgingival caries, accessing perforations and to treat aesthetic disproportions such as a gummy smile. There are a number of procedures used to achieve an increase in crown length. Biomechanical considerations=Biologic width Biologic width is the natural distance between the base of the gingival sulcus (G) and the height of the alveolar bone (I). The gingival sulcus (G) is a little crevice that lies between the enamel of the tooth crown and the sulcular epithelium. At the base of this crevice lies the junctional epithelium, which adheres via hemidesmosomes to the surface of the tooth, and from the base of the crevice to the height of the alveolar bone (C) is approximately 2 mm. Biologic width is the distance established by \\"the junctional epithelium and connective tissue attachment to the root surface\\" of a tooth. In other words, it is the height between the deepest point of the gingival sulcus and the alveolar bone crest. This distance is important to consider when fabricating dental restorations, because they must respect the natural architecture of the gingival attachment if harmful consequences are to be avoided. The biologic width is patient specific and may vary anywhere from 0.75-4.3 mm. Based on the 1961 paper by Gargiulo, the mean biologic width was determined to be 2.04 mm, of which 1.07 mm is occupied by the connective tissue attachment and another approximate 0.97 mm is occupied by the junctional epithelium.Gargiulo, AW, et al. _Dimensions and relations of the dentogingival junction in humans_. J Perio 1961;32:261‚Äì267. Because it is impossible to perfectly restore a tooth to the precise coronal edge of the junctional epithelium, it is often recommended to remove enough bone to have 3mm between the restorative margin and the crest of alveolar bone.Nevins, M; Skurow, HM. _The intracrevicular restorative margin, the biologic width, and the maintenance of the gingival margin_. Int J Perio Rest D 1984;3:31‚Äì49.Br√§gger, U.; et al. _Surgical crown lengthening of the clinical crown_. J Clin Perio 1992;19:58‚Äì63.Padbury Jr, A, et al. _Interactions between the gingiva and the margin of restorations_. J Clin Perio 2003;30:379‚Äì385. When restorations do not take these considerations into account and violate biologic width, three things tend to occur: *chronic pain *chronic inflammation of the gingiva *unpredictable loss of alveolar bone Ferrule effect In addition to crown lengthening to establish a proper biologic width, a 2 mm height of tooth structure should be available to allow for a ferrule effect.Galen WW, Mueller KI: Restoration of the Endodontically Treated Tooth. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 784. A ferrule, in respect to teeth, is a band that encircles the external dimension of residual tooth structure, not unlike the metal bands that exist around a barrel. Sufficient vertical height of tooth structure that will be grasped by the future crown is necessary to allow for a ferrule effect of the future prosthetic crown; it has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of fracture in the endodontically treated tooth.Barkhodar RA, Radke R, Abbasi J: _Effect of metal collars on resistance of endodontically treated teeth to root fracture_. J Prosthet Dent 61:676, 1989. Because beveled tooth structure is not parallel to the vertical axis of the tooth, it does not properly contribute to ferrule height; thus, a desire to bevel the crown margin by 1 mm would require an additional 1 mm of bone removal in the crown lengthening procedure.Fixed prosthodontic lecture series notes, Dr. Louis DiPede, New Jersey Dental School, 2004. Frequently, however, restorations are performed without such a bevel. Some recent studies suggest that, while ferrule is certainly desirable, it should not be provided at the expense of the remaining tooth/root structure.Stankiewicz NR, Wilson PR. _The ferrule effect: a literature review_. Int Endod J, 35:575‚Äì581, 2002. On the other hand, it has also been shown that the \\"difference between an effective, long-term restoration and a failure can be as small as 1 mm of additional tooth structure that, when encased by a ferrule, provides great protection. When such a long-lasting, functional restoration cannot be predictably created, tooth extraction should be considered.\\"Galen WW, Mueller KI: Restoration of the Endodontically Treated Tooth. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 771. Crown-to-root ratio The alveolar bone surrounding one tooth will naturally surround an adjacent tooth, and removing bone for a crown lengthening procedure will effectively damage the bony support of adjacent teeth to some inevitable extent, as well as unfavorably increase the crown-to-root ratio. Additionally, once bone is removed, it is almost impossible to regain it to previous levels, and in case a patient would like to have an implant placed in the future, there might not be enough bone in the region once a crown lengthening procedure has been completed. Thus, it would be prudent for patients to thoroughly discuss all of their treatment planning options with their dentist before undergoing an irreversible procedure such as crown lengthening. Treatment planning Replacement of unaesthetic crowns on the upper central teeth after undergoing crown lengthening and fabrication of new restorations. Crown lengthening is often done in conjunction with a few other expensive and time-consuming procedures of which the combined goal is to improve the prosthetic forecast of a tooth. If a tooth, because of its relative lack of solid tooth structure, also requires a post and core, and thus, endodontic treatment, the total combined time, effort, and cost of the various procedures, as well as the impaired prognosis due to the combined inherent failure rates of each procedure, might combine to make it reasonable to have the tooth extracted. If the patient and the extraction site make for eligible candidates, it might be possible to have an implant placed and restored with more esthetic, timely, inexpensive, and reliable results. It is important to consider the many options available during the treatment planning stages of dental care. An alternative to surgical crown lengthening is orthodontic forced eruption, it is non-invasive, does not remove or damage the bone and can be cost effective. The tooth is extruded a couple of millimeters with simple bracketing of adjacent teeth and using light forces this will only take a couple of months. A fiberotomy is performed after crown lengthening and is easily performed by the general dentist. In many cases such as this one shown, surgery and extraction may be avoided if patient is treated orthodontically rather than periodontally. Crown lengthening techniques=Apically repositioned flap with osseous recontouring (resection) An apically repositioned flap is a widely used procedure that involves flap elevation with subsequent osseous contouring. The flap is designed such that it is replaced more apical to its original position and thus immediate exposure of sound tooth structure is gained. As discussed above, when planning a crown lengthening procedure consideration must be given to maintenance of the biologic width. As a general rule, at least 4 mm of sound tooth structure must be exposed at the time of surgery. This, therefore, allows for proliferation of the supracrestal soft tissues, which are estimated to cover 2‚Äì 3 mm of the coronal root structure thereby leaving 1‚Äì2 mm of supragingivally located sound tooth structure. Furthermore, thought has to be given to the inherent tendency of gingival tissues to bridge abrupt changes in the contour of the bone crest. As such it is advised that bone recontouring must be performed not only around the problem tooth but also at the adjacent teeth to gradually reduce the osseous profile. Consequently, substantial amounts of attachment may have to be sacrificed when crown lengthening is accomplished with an apically positioned flap technique. It is also important to remember that, for esthetic reasons, symmetry of tooth length must be maintained between the right and left sides of the dental arch. This may, in some situations, call for the inclusion of even more teeth in the surgical procedure. = Indications = Crown lengthening of multiple teeth in a quadrant or sextant of the dentition = Contraindications = Single teeth in the aesthetic zone becomes increasingly destructive. = Technique = # A reverse bevel incision is made using a scalpel. This initial incision is guided by pre-operative planning and is based on the amount of tooth structure to be exposed. The beveling incision also should follow a scalloped outline, to ensure maximal interproximal coverage of the alveolar bone when the flap subsequently is repositioned. Vertical releasing incisions extending out into the alveolar mucosa, past the mucogingival junction, are made at each of the end points of the reverse incision, thereby making apical repositioning of the flap possible. # A full‚Äêthickness mucoperiosteal flap is then raised to expose the root surfaces. The flap, incorporating the buccal/ lingual gingiva and alveolar mucosa, then has to be elevated beyond the mucogingival line in order to be able later to reposition the soft tissue apically. The marginal collar of tissue is then removed with curettes. # Osseous recontouring is then performed using a rotating round bur and copious water spray or bone chisels. The recontouring should aim to re-create the normal form of the alveolar crest, but at a more apical level. # Following the osseous surgery, the flap is repositioned to the level of the newly recontoured alveolar bone crest and secured in position. Full soft tissue coverage is inherently more difficult and as such a periodontal dressing should be applied to protect the denuded interproximal alveolar bone to retain the soft tissue at the level of the bone crest. = Advantages = Immediate increase in sound tooth structure can be achieved. = Disadvantages = Difficult procedure for patients to tolerate, increased post-operative pain Forced tooth eruption Orthodontic tooth movement can be used to erupt teeth in adults. If moderate eruptive forces are applied, the entire eruptive apparatus will move in unison with the tooth. As such, the units required must be extruded a distance equal to or slightly longer than the portion of sound tooth structure that will be exposed in the following surgical treatment. Once stabilised, a full-thickness flap is then elevated and osseous recontouring is performed to expose the required tooth structure. To restore aesthetic proportions correctly, the hard and soft tissues of adjacent teeth should remain unchanged. = Indications = Forced tooth eruption is indicated where crown lengthening is required, but attachment and bone from adjacent teeth must be preserved. = Contraindications = Forced tooth eruption requires a fixed orthodontic appliance. This poses problems in patients with reduced dentitions; in such instances alternative crown lengthening procedures must be considered = Technique = Orthodontic brackets are bonded to the teeth requiring crown lengthening surgery and then to adjacent teeth, these are then combined within an archwire. A power elastic band is then tied from the bracket to the archwire (or the bar), which pulls the tooth coronally. The direction of the tooth movement must be carefully checked to ensure no tilting or movement of adjacent teeth occurs. Forced tooth eruption can also be performed with fiberotomy. This technique is adopted when gingival margins and crystal bone height are to be maintained at their pretreatment locations. Fiberotomy is performed at 7-10 day intervals during treatment. A scalpel is used to sever supracrestal connective tissue fibres, thereby preventing crystal bone from following the root in a coronal direction. = Advantages = Preserves osseous structure around adjacent teeth = Disadvantages = Procedure requires fixed wire placement. Treatment time can be prolonged.

It is culverted for its upper course, visible in St Anne's Park for its entire lower course, and causes flooding somewhere along its line most years. The river flows entirely within the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council. Etymology The origins of the name, also spelt sometimes as Nannikin or Naneken, are unclear, though it is been speculated that it might be a diminutive reflection of the much-larger Nanny River flowing just north of the County Dublin boundary. Course=Upper reaches The Naniken rises under Shanliss Way, in what is now a light industrial zone off Santry Lane, in Santry. It passes under Schoolhouse Lane and the Oak Park development, then by siphon below the Dublin Port Tunnel's northern portal area, and flows through Beaumont and Artane, passing Lorcan Crescent, Coolgariff Road, Kilmore Road and Ardlea Road, where a fully culverted tributary joins from the lands now occupied by Beaumont Hospital. The watercourse then runs by Maryfield Crescent, and on under Mornington Grove, near the Artane Roundabout, to cross the Malahide Road, and then continues through southern Artane and western Harmonstown, coming into Raheny via a siphon under the railway. It then flows under a former laneway, by an early suburban apartment development, Rosevale. The stretch from Harmonstown to St Anne's Park is sometimes known as the Ballyhoy River, and a road within the St. Anne's housing estate was named after it. In Raheny, the Naniken once formed the boundary of the Church of Ireland glebe (rectory lands). The river passes under Howth Road at the site of Ballyhoy Bridge, and emerges from its culvert to flow openly through St Anne's Park. St Anne's Park to the sea The Naniken is a central feature of Dublin's second largest municipal park, a former Guinness family estate. It passes in a shady channel through an area of playing fields, runs through the Dublin City Millennium Arboretum, and then flows in a more distinct valley through the central reaches of the park. In the 19th century there was a pond northwest of the modern-day nursery, with a small waterfall, but this is entirely gone now. Some artificial features were constructed for the Guinnesses near the river, including ornamental bridges (one high bridge removed for safety reasons in the 1980s), at least one ford, and a couple of wider areas. Near the coast an offtake supplies the Duck Pond (or Old Pond), while the river itself flows around and passes under the James Larkin Road to enter the western half of the \\"lagoon\\" (also known as Crab Water or Raheny Lake) behind North Bull Island. The line of the Naniken from its mouth marks the boundary of the civil parish of Raheny with that of Clontarf, and the beginning of the Raheny portion of the Bull Island. Culverting As with many of Dublin's smaller watercourses, the upper and middle reaches of the Naniken were culverted over time, the covering of the stretch from Coolgariff Road to Kilmore Road being mentioned in parliamentary proceedings in 1960 by Neil Blaney, for example. Link to River Santry There is a drainage link between the Naniken and the Santry River, at the western end of Kilmore West, to reduce the general flow from the river's upper reaches, and to deal with flooding or overflow situations. Flooding This small but long-established river causes flooding, as with the neighbouring Wad River, in many years. Frequent locations include Maryfield Crescent,Dublin, Ireland: Dublin City Council - Feb. 2013 Notice of Monthly Meeting of North Central Area Committee, , p.10 - re flooding in the area of Maryfield Crescent 2008, 2009, 2011, and possible solutions thereto Rosemount Avenue and parts of Kilmore. In 2014, the City Manager acknowledged the flood risks, noted that there was no near-term funding for serious remedial works, but agreed that the City Council would invest 60,000 euro in a hydraulic study.

It is northeast of Monterrey on Mexican Federal Highway 2. (26¬∞28'N 99¬∞10'W) In 1990, the population was recorded at 6,190. By the 2010 census, it had dropped to 4,762 inhabitants.2010 census tables: INEGI It has an agricultural economy centered on cotton, sugar cane, corn, and livestock. History The town was founded on March 6, 1753. The land was originally owned by Felix de Almandoz. Land later passed on to General Prudencio Basterra who married Felix's sister Ana Maria. 19 Families from Camargo formed the new settlement. The town is called Mier because the governor of Nuevo Le√≥n from 1710 to 1714, Francisco Mier y Torre, used to spend the night there on his way to Texas. It began to be called Estancia de Mier and then simply Mier. This is where the steamboats used to stop when they came up the R√≠o Bravo. Conflicts with the Republic of Texas On his return to power, General Santa Anna sent a force of seven hundred men, mostly mounted Mexican troops under the command of General R√°fael V√°squez, to occupy San Antonio in early March 1842. The \\"war hawks\\" in the Texas Congress forced President Sam Houston to act. The President ordered General Alexander Somervell to command the assembling volunteers at San Antonio. Men of all kinds came pouring into town, some shoeless, most horseless, some seeking adventure, and others of the criminal sort, wishing only to sack Mexican towns and villages. As Houston had hoped, Somervell acted indecisively. Soon, considerable looting of Tejano stores in San Antonio, coupled with out-and-out insubordination, broke up the volunteers before they could march on Mexico and start a major war. Relations between Texas and Mexico worsened, especially after the Mexican general Adri√°n Woll and fourteen hundred troops again captured San Antonio in September. Houston once again summoned Somervell to organize and lead the volunteers but hoped that the Texas general would remain north of the Nueces River. But as the army grew to 750 men, even Somervell realized that he would have to act. His volunteers had taken on an identity of their own; had he refused to march, the troops would have left him. The army was slowly breaking up as a result of the disorder and looting, after Laredo was captured. The 500 who remained followed Somervell south to Guerrero, where pillaging occurred. Here a mutiny erupted in which 189 men followed William S. Fisher, Ewen Cameron, and Thomas Green into the Mexican town of Mier. On December 23, 1842, Fisher and most of the men crossed the Rio Grande and entered the Ciudad Mier, where they met no resistance. They demanded supplies from the town, which the town's alcalde promised to deliver. The troops withdrew and waited. In the meantime, a large detachment of Mexican troops arrived in the town. On December 25, the two sides engaged in a bloody battle that lasted almost 24 hours. The Texans sustained thirty casualties and ran out of food, water, and ammunition. More than 200 Texans surrendered to Mexican forces, unaware that they had mauled the Mexican troops to an almost unbelievable degree, inflicting an astounding 800 casualties. As far as the Mexicans were concerned, the Texans were privateers on an unauthorized raid and entitled to no consideration as military prisoners of war. They were sentenced to death and then taken on a forced march to Mexico City. Fisher was separated from the group, but the men selected a leader from among themselves, a Scottish-born captain named Ewen Cameron. Along the way, Cameron led most of the prisoners in an escape attempt. The Texans tried to make a run back for the border, but they hadn't bargained on the harsh and dry conditions in the mountains. All but three were recaptured and returned to the town of Salado, Tamaulipas.\\"BLACK BEAN EPISODE,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qmb01), accessed February 23, 2015. Uploaded on June 12, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. When he heard about the break-out, Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna ordered that the recaptured prisoners, some 176 men, be put to death immediately. The Governor of Coahuila, Francisco Mex√≠a, refused to carry out the order and pleaded with foreign ministers in Mexico City to persuade the president to change his mind. (Santa Anna was out of office from 26 October 1842 to 4 March 1843, with Nicol√°s Bravo serving in the Presidential capacity.) What happened next became known as the \\"Black Bean Episode.\\" Santa Anna promised the foreign ministers that he would show mercy, and then modified his decree to order the decimation of the Mier prisoners; in other words, the execution of every tenth man. At El Rancho Salado, which was presumably in the state of Coahuila, on March 25, 1843 ‚Äì three months after the Battle of Mier - the prisoners were forced to draw a bean from a jar (while blindfolded) containing 159 white beans and 17 black beans. At dusk that day, those unlucky enough to draw a black bean were shot to death, in two groups. Cameron had drawn a white bean, which should have saved his life. However, he had earned the hostility of Mexican Colonel Antonio Canales Rosillo, for his role in the embarrassing defeat in his battle (July 1842 at Fort Lipantitl√°n, near Corpus Christi, Texas),Ewen Cameron in Handbook of Texas and for leading the escape attempt. Canales intervened with Santa Anna, and he agreed. Cameron was shot by a firing squad at Perote Prison on April 26, 1843. The remaining prisoners were put to work on a road gang. In September 1843, most of them were confined at the notorious Perote Prison in the state of Veracruz, while a few were separated from the group and scattered into other prisons around Mexico. Over the next few months, some managed to escape, while others died of wounds, disease, and starvation. Diplomats from the United States and Great Britain worked for the release of the Mier prisoners. They were eventually paroled in piecemeal fashion, with the last prisoner going home in September 1844. In 1847, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the remains of the men executed in the Black Bean Episode were retrieved from Mexico and interred near La Grange, Texas, (with those who died in the Dawson Massacre), at which site has been established a monument. Fidel Castro in Mier One historic event from Mier occurred in 1956 involving Fidel Castro. At that time Ciudad Mier had near 4,000 inhabitants. Its isolation and close proximity with the U.S. border led to it becoming a mecca for smugglers. Fidel Castro had learned of the fashion in which any merchandise could be crossed illegally by the Rio Grande into Mier. At that time Castro was preparing for a revolution in Cuba and was meeting with leaders in Mexico City. Castro needed weapons and went to Mier to obtain them. Mier town historian Antonio Guerra said only the best smugglers received the assignment. The operation was assigned to Juan 'El Chapiado' Gonz√°lez, from Mier, and Santiago 'El Chago' Guerra, from Agualeguas (Nuevo Le√≥n). These men acquired the weapons in the United States then passed them over the Rio Grande in boats. When they disembarked the weapons were then unloaded at the Los Guajes Ranch, owned by Jesus 'El Gavilan' Ram√≠rez. Family and acquaintances of these men relate that after hiding the weapons, the group was directed to travel to the Cantina de la Loma del Peligro bar, many miles down the highway leading from Mier to Ciudad Guerrero. There they met the buyer of the merchandise. In the bar it was agreed that the weapons would continue south, leaving Mier to Aldamas. From there they would travel to Veracruz where they would be loaded into a yacht named Granma. Castro later confirmed that the weapons leading to the Cuban revolution indeed passed through Mier with the help of Mexican smugglers. Abandonment Ciudad Mier was largely abandoned in 2010 due to the bloody turf war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas after the death of Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the drug boss of the Gulf organization. The fight between the drug cartels resulted in the death or kidnapping of all the police forces in the municipality of Ciudad Mier. Approximately 95% of the population left Ciudad Mier and went to Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas, as a result of the violence generated by the drug cartels in the Mexican Drug War. Consequently, the president of Mexico, Felipe Calder√≥n, ordered the creation of a military headquarters in the area, and now more than 600 military elements patrol the streets of Mier.

Geography=Neighboring villages The neighboring villages surrounding R√∂ttenbach are Adelsdorf, Baiersdorf, He√üdorf, and Hemhofen. History=Middle Ages Around the year 1000, settlers came in search of land in the wooded, rolling hills, which form the foothills of the Steigerwald. They settled near a creek and cleared parts of the forest to create arable land. The name R√∂ttenbach was originally Rodenbach, derived from the German word for stream or creek (Bach) and the verb roden (to clear land). Wide marshes, which rested on the impermeable layers of brick clay that lie on the Keupere, were not conducive to productive agriculture. Over the centuries the inhabitants cultivated the marshes creating many of the series of ponds used often for carp farming and other aquaculture that still divide the forests to the north, east and west of R√∂ttenbach. In the 13th century a descendant from seneschal (Truchse√ü) of Pommersfelden took the area in possession, named themselves the ‚ÄòTruchse√ü von R√∂ttenbach‚Äô and founded R√∂ttenbach. Deeds show that farms and estates were divided among landlords and changed owners several times. In 1322 an Estate went to the abbot of the monastery Michaelsberg, in 1329 another to the bailiff at Nuremberg Castle. In 1476 the Bamberger cloister founded its Court in R√∂ttenbach. The main courtyard of the area, from which the manor later emerged, is first mentioned in a deed of gift from Bamberg dated 1433 for the Stewards Peter und Veit. On this farm, now the area around the Brauerei Sauer (Sauer Brewery), stood a castle which was protected by a moat. Nevertheless, insurgent peasants burned down the castle during the Peasants' War of 1525. The main residence later was later rebuilt and remains to this day, as well as a sandstone coat of arms from 1591 which still exists on the south wall of the brewery. In 1610, the possession of the residence was promised to the Steward of Pappenheim. In 1710 it fell into the possession of the Bishopric of Bamberg. Part of the goods and the people of the estate then belonged to the Imperial City of N√ºrnberg and the Baron Winkler von Mohrenfels (Hemhofen). In the 1803 during the Napoleonic era, R√∂ttenbach was awarded to the Prussian crown, but fell in 1810, as well as the whole of Franconia, to the Kingdom of Bavaria. Until the mid-20th Century most of the population remained poor and lived mostly as day laborers. A small additional income for many was to gather mushrooms and berries, pinecones, as well as water lilies and sundews (drosera). The majority of these natural products were brought to Erlangen for sale. Others drove through southern Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and sold horseradish, for which the region was famous. The strong sense of salesmanship laid the foundation during the difficult years after the 2nd World War for an unforeseen economic boom in the region. The low-level Franconian timber-framed farmhouses disappeared quickly and were replaced by modern housing. As a result, unfortunately the only remaining historically significant buildings are forester's house with a half-timbered barn & storage building, and the rectory, both of which were built in the Baroque style. In 1972 during the regional reform of Upper Franconia, R√∂ttenbach became part of Middle Franconia. In turn, more and more new residents streamed from the metropolitan region of Nuremberg-Erlangen- F√ºrth to the then quiet village. R√∂ttenbach grew rapidly and took on its present form. In 1980, the short lived era of municipal association with Hemhofen was dissolved. Population growth R√∂ttenbach had less than 1000 inhabitants up into the 1940s. After World War II the population rose sharply. As of December 31, 2009, R√∂ttenbach had 4628 inhabitants of which 2,357 were female and 2,271 were male. Nature R√∂ttenbach is part of the sand axis of Franconia (Sandachse Franken) and has numerous small sections of neglected grassland, sand fields and dry edges of forest that serve many specialized animals as a living environment. A prominent part of the surroundings of R√∂ttenbach are the many chains of ponds. Economy=Traffic From R√∂ttenbach, the Autbahn 3 via Dechsendorf, as well as the Autobahn 73 via Baiersdorf can be reached in a few minutes. The Bundesstra√üe 470 runs to the north.

It was launched on 11 August 2001 and closed on 12 May 2002, precipitating ITV Digital's collapse over a month later. ITV Sport Channel had two sister channels, ITV Sport Plus and ITV Sport Select. Matt Smith, Tony Dorigo, Russell Osman, Bob Wilson, John Hendrie, Garry Nelson, Guy Havord, Guy Mowbray, Peter Drury, Jon Champion, David Fairclough, Paul Walsh, Jim Beglin, Simon Hill, Peter Stevenson, Carrie Frais, Lisa Rogers and Dave Beckett presented and commentated for the channel. History The ITV Sport Channel can trace its foundations back to 1999 when the then named ONdigital service acquired exclusive rights to screen every match from the UEFA Champions League, to supplement ITV's existing coverage of the competition. Two channels to show the matches were set up, entitled Champions on 98 and Champions on 99, reflecting the channel numbers these were broadcast on. Prior to the 2000-01 season, these channels were re-branded respectively as ONsport 1 and ONsport 2, after ONdigital had purchased rights to the ATP Masters Series tennis. Whilst ONsport 1 broadcast 24 hours a day, ONsport 2 timeshared with Carlton Cinema. In June 2000, ONdigital successfully outbid BSkyB for the rights to show live matches from The Football League and the League Cup, for a massive ¬£315m over three seasons, at least five times more than any broadcaster had previously bid for it. The launch of the ITV Sport Channel was announced in April 2001 and both ONsport 1 and ONsport 2 were closed down prior to its launch and the subsequent renaming of the ONdigital service to ITV Digital. The channel launched on 11 August 2001 with Manchester City v Watford in the First Division and was available on ITV Digital and ntl cable. However it did not broadcast on SkyITV Digital's question of sportITV Sport 'wanted ¬£80m for Sky carriage' or on Telewest. There were also two spin-off channels, ITV Sport Plus and ITV Sport Select. ITV Sport Select showed the on-demand Premier League football matches from Sky Sports and ITV Sport Plus was available on Champions League matchdays to show additional live matches from the competition. The cost of the Football League deal proved one too many a burden for ITV Digital, and it was placed into administration on 27 March 2002, after the League refused to accept a ¬£130m pay cut in its ¬£315m deal with the ITV Sport Channel. Most subscription channels ceased broadcasting on ITV Digital on 1 May 2002, with the ITV Sport Channel being re-designated as a free-to-air channel. The collapse caused severe financial difficulties for lower-division football clubs who had budgeted for large incomes from the television contract. The Football League sued ITV Digital's parent companies, Carlton and Granada, claiming that the firms had breached their contract in failing to deliver the guaranteed income. The League lost the case, with the judge ruling that it had \\"failed to extract sufficient written guarantees\\". The League then filed a negligence claim against its lawyers for failing to press for a written guarantee at the time of the deal with ITV Digital. This time it was awarded a paltry ¬£4 in damages of the ¬£150m it was seeking. The channel closed on 11 May 2002 with coverage of the Division 2 play-off final between Brentford and Stoke.ITV Sport to close on May 11 Eventually, in 2017, ITV would launch a similar channel by the name ITV Box Office, showing pay-per-view boxing and wrestling events, that service also shut down shortly after in 2020. Programming Throughout its time on air football was the mainstay of the channel. In addition the live Football League coverage, the channel showed Saturday night primetime highlights from all three divisions. The UEFA Champions League coverage previously shown on ONsport moved to the channel and this helped to fill out the channel's schedule. As well as football, other sports were also covered, including ATP Masters Series tennis, snooker,Billion-pound battle of the box - ITV sports channel takes on Sky in contest for armchair fans British basketball and boxing from the United States. The channel also acquired secondary rights to European Cup rugby union.

Plot Tom is a famous singer announced as \\"Signor Thomasino Catti-Cazzaza Baritone,\\" who will perform at a concert to sing Largo al factotum. Tom arrives in a very long limousine, and emerges, tossing a rose into a frenzied crowd. He walks on stage to applause, which he interrupts with a simple hand gesture, and begins to sing for the audience watching. While all of this is taking place, down below the stage, Jerry is trying to sleep but is awakened by Tom's operatic tones. Jerry tries to gesture for Tom to stop, by banging on the stage with a toothbrush but in return Tom, while singing, stomps on the floor enough to get Jerry to shake and bounce around his \\"room\\". Enraged, Jerry uses a hammer to pound a floorboard, shooting Tom out of his tuxedo into the air, from where he falls back into it, but upside down, and legs through sleeves. Tom tiptoes offstage to change back to normal. Next, Tom sings again, this time, stomping the floor while performing, much harder than before, creating a huge rumble in Jerry's house, eventually causing Jerry's bed to collapse on top of him. Jerry thinks it's war and decides to get revenge. Tom continues the performance and Jerry holds up a sign through the vent onstage that has \\"PSST\\" written on it. Tom continues singing as he pokes his head in, and Jerry snaps his lips closed in a pucker with a doubled rubber band. In retaliation, Tom uses the rubber band to shoot a long staple into the vent, which shoots down, ricochets several times, and then whisks Jerry right out of his nightshirt, and pins him up on the wall by his neck. Jerry crosses his arms, one leg over the other, and then \\"taps\\" his foot midair, looking exceedingly annoyed. As Tom sings in the middle of his performance, Jerry manages to get free from the staple and at the side of the stage licks a lemon so Tom gets sour by the thought of the scene, and salivating, his lips pucker and shrink. Frustrated, he goes to Jerry and while continuing to sing, juices the lemon on Jerry's head. Tom returns to the spotlight. Jerry then drills a hole in the floor and uses a hooked wire to pull the bottom of Tom's cummerbund apart, causing it to spring up and whap him in the face. Tom grabs the wire and yanks it up and down banging Jerry's head on the board until Jerry thinks to let it go. While Tom is singing the \\"Figaro!\\" part, Jerry aims a plunger at Tom's mouth and scores a direct hit. Jerry imitates Tom mockingly; but then Tom sticks him to the floor with the plunger. Using Jerry's bow, he shoots Jerry in the plunger onto a wall offstage. Jerry frees himself and accidentally drops a huge sandbag on Tom as he is reaching the climax, causing him to get knocked through the floor with a loud crash. Everything is silent until Jerry walks onto the stage in a tuxedo. Now the mouse is above, and the cat stuck below, with his head flattened by the sandbag hit, and Jerry sings the last section of the performance himself (albeit in a high-pitched voice). An infuriated (and obviously upstaged) Tom raps on the floor with a broom and sends Jerry flying, but this just adds to Jerry's drama singing the final few notes, as he makes a graceful balletic landing before getting loud applause. The words \\"The End\\" then appear on the close curtains.

It is used by First Essex buses who operate many of the routes in the county of Essex and especially in the South East of the county. It has the depot code HH. History It was originally used by Westcliff on Sea Motor Services, before that company was absorbed into Eastern National. In July 1990, the south Essex and London activities of Eastern National became part of a new company, called Thamesway. At that time, Eastern National was under ownership of its management, having been sold off by the National Bus Company in 1986. In 1990 it passed to Badgerline Holdings. In 1999 Badgerline and GRT Holdings joined to form First. After the formation of First, the company became one whole unit again; First Essex. Location The depot is located on London Road, Hadleigh, just west of the shopping centre and about 6 miles from central Southend. The depot is immediately to the east of a roundabout where the A13 London Road/Kiln Road meets the B1014 Benfleet Rd and A129 Rayleigh Road. Description of depot It is currently the main depot for First buses serving the Southend area, following the closure of the depots at Southend (Prittlewell) in 1992; Southend (London Road) in 1987, and Canvey in 1978. The depot consists of a large garage/workshop building, with an enquiry office on the London Road frontage. There are two yards, on the east and west sides of the complex. Buses enter the depot from the east, and pass through a wash and fuelling point on this side of the garage. Buses mainly exit from the west side. At May 2015, Hadleigh has a variety of single and double deckers. The double deckers are Dennis Tridents with Plaxton President bodies, but there are 5 with ALX 400 bodies. The single deckers consist of Wright StreetLites and Dennis Darts. The Darts are mostly Enviro 200 bodied and there are also 7 Marshall bodied Darts. There are 6 remaining Plaxton Pointer bodied Darts in service, but these are soon due to be replaced by more StreetLites.

In this model, four attributes are taken into consideration: factor conditions, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and firm strategy, structure, and rivalry. According to Michael Porter, the model's creator, \\"These determinants create the national environment in which companies are born and learn how to compete.\\"  Background  Strategic analysis typically focuses on two views of organization: the industry-view and the resource-based view (RBV). These views analyse the organisation without taking into consideration relationship between the organizations strategic choice (i.e. Porter generic strategies) and institutional frameworks. The diamond model is a tool for analyzing the organization's task environment. The diamond model highlights that strategic choices should not only be a function of industry structure and a firm's resources, it should also be a function of the constraints of the institutional framework. Institutional analysis (such as the diamond model) becomes increasingly important as firms enter new operating environments and operate within new institutional frameworks. Porter's National Diamond framework resulted from a study of patterns of comparative advantage among industrialized nations. It works to integrate much of Porter's previous work in his competitive five forces theory, his value chain framework as well as his theory of competitive advantage into a consolidated framework that looks at the sources of competitive advantage sourcable from the national context. It can be used both to analyze a firm's ability to function in a national market, as well as analyse a national market's ability to compete in an international market. It recognizes four pillars of research (factor conditions, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, firm structure, strategy and rivalry) that one must undertake in analysing the viability of a nation competing in a particular international market, but it also can be used as a comparative analysis tool in recognising which country a particular firm is suited to expanding into. Two of the aforementioned pillars focus on the (national) macroeconomics environment to determine if the demand is present along with the factors needed for production (i.e. both extreme ends of the value chain). Another pillar focuses on the specific relationships supporting industries have with the particular firm/nation/industry being studied. The last pillar it looks at the firm's strategic response (microeconomics) i.e. its strategy, taking into account the industry structure and rivalry (see five forces). In this way it tries to highlight areas of competitive advantage as well as competitive weakness, by looking at a companies/nations suitability to the particular conditions of a particular market. A graphical representation of Porter's National Diamond Components The four different components of the framework are: Factor conditions (endowments) Factor conditions include the nation's production resources, including infrastructure, labor force, land, and natural resources. According to Porter, \\"a nation does not inherit but instead creates the most important factors of production‚Äîsuch as skilled human resources or a scientific base.\\" A lack of less important factors, such as an unskilled labor force or access to raw materials, can be mediated through technology or by implementing what Porter calls \\"a global strategy.\\" Factor endowment can be categorized into two forms: * \\"Home-grown\\" resources/highly specialized resources * Natural endowments For example, in analyzing Hollywood's preeminence in film production, Porter has pointed out the local concentration of skilled labor, including the different schools of film (UCLA & USC) in the area. Also, resource constraints may encourage development of substitute capabilities; Japan's relative lack of raw materials has spurred miniaturization and zero- defect manufacturing. Related and supporting industries This component refers to industries that supply, distribute, or are otherwise related to the industry being examined. For many firms, the presence of related and supporting industries is of critical importance to the growth of that particular industry. A critical concept here is that national competitive strengths tend to be associated with \\"clusters\\" of industries. For example, Silicon Valley in the US and Silicon Glen in the UK are techno clusters of high-technology industries which includes individual computer software and semi-conductor firms. In Germany, a similar cluster exists around chemicals, synthetic dyes, textiles and textile machinery. Demand conditions Demand conditions in the domestic market provide the primary driver of growth, innovation and quality improvement. The premise is that a strong domestic market stimulates the firm from being a startup to a slightly expanded and bigger organization. As an illustration, we can take the case of Germany which has some of the world's premier automobile companies like Mercedes, BMW, Porsche. German auto companies have dominated the world when it comes to the high-performance segment of the world automobile industry. However, their position in the market of cheaper, mass-produced autos is much weaker. This can be linked to a domestic market which has traditionally demanded a high level of engineering performance. Also, the transport infrastructure of Germany, with its Autobahns does tend to favor high-performance automobiles. Strategy, structure and rivalry National performance in particular sectors is inevitably related to the strategies and the structure of the firms in that sector. Competition plays a big role in driving innovation and the subsequent upgradation of competitive advantage. Since domestic competition is more direct and impacts earlier than steps taken by foreign competitors, the stimulus provided by them is higher in terms of innovation and efficiency. As an example, the Japanese automobile industry with 8 major competitors (Honda, Toyota, Suzuki, Isuzu, Nissan, Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Subaru) provide intense competition in the domestic market, as well as the foreign markets in which they compete.  Other factors  Porter identifies two other variables that affect competitiveness. These factors \\"support and complement the system of national competitiveness but do not create lasting competitive advantages.\\" =The role of government= The role of government in Porter's Diamond Model is \\"acting as a catalyst and challenger; it is to encourage - or even push - companies to raise their aspirations and move to higher levels of competitive performance ...\\" . They must encourage companies to raise their performance, stimulate early demand for advanced products, focus on specialized factor creation and to stimulate local rivalry by limiting direct cooperation and enforcing anti-trust regulations. =Chance= The role of chance basically denotes the idea that it may occur that many times a product or an enterprise may get an opportunity to maximize its benefits out of sheer luck. Thus chance plays a key role in determining the fate of the product as well. Criticism Criticism on Porter's national diamond model revolve around a number of assumptions that underlie it. As described by Davies and Ellis: > \\"sustained prosperity may be achieved without a nation becoming 'innovation- > driven', strong 'diamonds' are not in place in the home bases of many > internationally successful industries and inward foreign direct investment > does not indicate a lack of 'competitiveness' or low national productivity\\". Porter generalized from the North American, European and Japanese experiences; for countries developing in the presence of these now developed regions of the world, the model may need to be re-examined.

From 2005 to 2020, it still houses the National Academy of Performing Arts.Hindu Gymkhana on archnet.org website Retrieved 19 May 2020Hindu Gymkhana as archaeological site Dawn (newspaper), Published 3 April 2012, Retrieved 19 May 2020 History The Hindu Gymkhana was established by the Seth Ramgopal Gourdhanandh Mohatta and the Hindu community in 1925 on a plot of 47,000 square yards. It was designed by Agha Ahmed Hussain. It was named Seth Ramgopal Goverdhandas Mohatta Hindu Gymkhana at that time. After the Independence, the Hindu Gymkhana was taken over by the Evacuee Trust Property Board. In 1978, about 60 per cent the land of Hindu Gymkhana was given to the Police Department and another 6000 square yards were given to the Federal Public Service Commission. Later, 3500 square yards were given to the Ali Garh Muslim University and another 400 square yards was allotted to Abdul Majeed Khan received almost of land as an allotment. Currently it has only 4,500 square yards of land compared to 47,000 square yards in 1925. The building's condition deteriorated over the years, and it was almost demolished in 1984. It was protected by the intervention of the Heritage Foundation of Pakistan. In 2005, the Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf handed the building over to National Academy of Performing ArtsThe Hindu Gymkhana now houses Pakistan's National Academy of Performing Arts (NAPA) and is run by its chief Zia Mohyeddin - a prominent stage and Pakistani television personality. Architecture thumb The building was designed by architect Agha Ahmed Hussain, with a design based on the tomb of Itamad-ud- Daulah (1628) in Agra. The building is small in size (on a plot of land measuring 47,000 square yards) and consists primarily of a hall and some smaller rooms used for administrative purposes. Stone for the walls was acquired in Bijapur. The roof line is defined by delicate massing of cupolas and balustrades directly influenced by Akbar's Fatehpur Sikri. The octagonal corner towers framing the projecting central jharoka are capped with chattris, highlighting the influence of Rajasthani Style of Palaces. Smaller chattris highlight the corners of the projecting porch that carry the drooping bangladar roof used in Emperor Akbar's period. The projecting chajjas are supported by ornamental brackets. The cupolas of the chattris are reinforced concrete and the walls are dressed in Gizri stone. Some of the carved elements are of Jodhpur stone. Protected Sindh Cultural Heritage building This historic building is widely considered to be an architectural gem in Karachi and is protected under the Sindh Cultural Heritage Protection Act. Therefore, nobody is allowed to carry out new construction, repairs, renovations in this building without the approval of Karachi Building Control Authority and the Government of Sindh. Surprisingly a historical building like this had deteriorated due to lack of maintenance in the recent past and was going to be demolished in 1984 but the Heritage Foundation Pakistan back then intervened to save it. Relocation of NAPA ordered In December 2018, The Supreme Court of Pakistan had directed the Sindh government to shift NAPA to another location from this Hindu Gymkhana building but, as of 11 February 2020, compliance to this directive could not be made and NAPA was still functioning there. Movements by Hindu community to get back Hindu Gymkhana The Hindu Gymkhana belonged to Hindus before Independence. The Hindu community of Karachi have no place in Karachi to celebrate religious festivals. In 1960, the first movement to handover Hindu Gymkhana back to the Hindu community was launched by activists Bhagwandas Chawla, Khubchand Bhatia and Seth T Motandas. However, the movement was ended due to the 1965 war. It was launched again but was ended due to the 1971 war. In 1980, the movement was launched again by Ramesh Mana co-chairperson of Pak-Hindu Welfare Association when the Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq government decided to sell the property. Later another movement was launched by P.K. Shahani, Hindu activist which compelled the parliamentarians to raise this issue in the Pakistan National Assembly and the Hindu Gymkhana was added on the list of heritage sites under the Sindh Heritage Act. But later the Pervez Musharraf‚Äôs government took over the Hindu Gymkhana and gave it to the National institute of performing arts(NAPA). In 2009, the Pakistan People's Party protested when the president Pervez Musharraf handed over the Hindu Gymkhana to the NAPA.

It was established in 1926 and re-established in 2000. This secondary school is home to the Dunbar High School Academy of Technology Excellence and the Dunbar High School Center for Math and Science. It is the home of the \\"Fighting Tigers\\". The school mascot is a tiger and the school colors are orange and green. The school received an \\"A\\" grade for the 2009-2010 school year, along with two other Lee County schools. History In 1926, Dunbar High School was constructed as the third public high school in Lee County, on what is now High Street in Fort Myers. It was named for the poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar. The construction of this school, along with the adjacent Williams Primary, provided K-12 educational opportunities for the black children of the area. This Dunbar High School graduated its last class of students in 1962. This original facility, renamed as the Dunbar Community School, continues to provide services to meet the educational needs of community members young and old. In 1962, students moved to a new school on Edison Avenue which was named Dunbar Senior High School. Graduates emerged from the halls of this school from 1962 through 1969. In 1969, this school was closed due to changes required by the federal desegregation order, and students were reassigned to the various traditionally white schools. The school would later reopen as Dunbar Middle School. Notably, the middle school on Edison Avenue changed its name to again honor the poet ‚Äì it became Paul Laurence Dunbar Middle School. In the fall of 2000, Paul Laurence Dunbar Middle School moved to its new location, on Winkler Avenue Extension, just south of Colonial Boulevard. Also, in the fall of 2000, Dunbar High School was opened - on East Edison Avenue (where the middle school was located). The Center for Math and Science The Center for Math and Science's title is usually shortened to just \\"C.M.S.\\" CMS is a program that helps Dunbar students exceed in math and science related areas. A separate application is required to be admitted into the center. Registered students have the opportunity to listen to a number of special guest speakers and an optional study period called CMS Research. The Dunbar High School Center for Math and Science has had success in both the Thomas Alva Edison Kiwanis Science and Engineering Fair and the Florida State Science Olympiad. Recently the Science Olympiad team received first place in the regional competition at FAU. Science Olympiad DHS is also home to a Science Olympiad team. 2006: In the 2006 Florida state competition, Dunbar fielded one team which placed sixth. 2007:In the 2007 competition season, Dunbar fielded two teams in both the regional and state competitions. On Dunbar's C-15 team, team members Joseph Scofield and Smit Patel placed third in Forensics, and team members Abigail Bryant and Josh Katine placed third in Rocks & Minerals. Dunbar's C-18 team placed first in Remote Sensing with team members Juan Carlos Quijada and Woody Culp. C-15 received 8th Place overall with a total of 240 points. C-18 received Tenth Place overall with a total of 263 points. Notably, Ernest R. Greer achieved third place by himself in a team competition. 2008: In 2008, the Dunbar team competed in the regional competition at FAU. The team received first place overall in this competition. The Academy for Technology Excellence In the fall of 2005, Dunbar High School began the Academy for Technology Excellence. Upon completion of the program, students are prepared to excel in a technologically advanced society. The program offers 9th-12th grade students hands-on experiences taught by highly certified instructors. All ATE students have the opportunity to acquire 12 or more recognized industry standard computer certifications in areas associated with information technology.

United Kingdom  In the Royal Navy in the middle of the 18th century, the term ordinary seaman was used to refer to a seaman with between one and two years' experience at sea, who showed enough seamanship to be so rated by their captain.Lavery 1989, p. 129 A seaman with less than a year's experience was referred to as a landsman. One with more than two years' experience and considered \\"well acquainted with his duty\\" was referred to as an able seaman.Naval Records Society: Five Naval Journals 1787-1817. Cited in Lavery 1989, p. 129 Later, the term was formalized as a rating for the lowest normal grade of seaman. They are not trained in any special task. They are required to work at physically hard tasks of great variety. One needs an Ordinary Seaman Certificate to obtain work. One can become an able seaman as a promotion from this position. In the modern Royal Navy the rank of Able Seaman is achieved by all recruits on completion of basic training (HMS Raleigh) and subsequent intensive training in the specialisation of choice. Thus the rank of Ordinary Seaman is obsolete. This is in line with increasing technical specialisation and ability of RN personnel.http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Careers/Pay-Benefits- and-Learning/Pay-Details  United States  Ordinary seaman was the second- lowest rank of the 19th century United States Navy, ranking above landsman and below seaman. Promotion from landsman to ordinary seaman required three years of experience or re-enlistment. An ordinary seaman who gained six years of experience and \\"knew the ropes\\", that is, knew the name and use of every line in the ship's rigging, could be promoted to seaman. An ordinary seaman's duties aboard ship included \\"handling and splicing lines, and working aloft on the lower mast stages and yards.\\" The rank existed from 1797 to 1917, when it was renamed \\"seaman second class\\". Seaman second class was later changed to the modern-day rank of seaman apprentice. The related ranks of ordinary seaman second class and ordinary seaman, engineer's force, existed in 1876‚Äì1885 and 1871‚Äì1883, respectively. The term is still in use in the United States Merchant Marine for entry-level deck personnel; the common abbreviation is OS.

The position is an apprenticeship to become an able seaman, and has been for centuries. In modern times, an OS is required to work on a ship for a specific amount of time, gaining what is referred to as \\"sea time\\". For centuries, the term ordinary seaman was used to refer to a seaman with between one and two years' experience at sea, who showed enough seamanship to be so rated by their captain.Lavery 1989, p. 129 Historically in some navies and the merchant marine a sailor with less experience was called a landsman.Sailors and Seamen An OS is generally not required to stand watch, but must pass examinations on watchstanding skills such as performing lookout duty and being a helmsman. Thus an OS will often be found on a ship's bridge after working hours taking a turn at the ship's wheel or being familiarized with bridge equipment. During the apprenticeship, an OS performs a variety of duties concerned with the operation and upkeep of deck department areas and equipment. These duties vary with the type of ship, the type of voyage, the number of crewmembers, the weather, the supervisor, and any number of other variables. However, in most cases, one can expect an ordinary seaman to clean, to perform maintenance, to work with deck equipment, and to undergo on-the- job-training under the supervision of senior deck department members. Duties As an ordinary seaman, one's duties may include the following: { bgcolor=\\"#f7f8ff\\" align=\\"center\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\\" -bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\"  colspan=\\"2\\"  Typical ordinary seaman duties - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" ! Illustration !! Description - valign=\\"top\\" 150px Scale, buff, and paint decks and superstructure. A ship's metal structure is under constant attack from the corrosive properties of seawater. Members of a ship's deck department spend a good deal of time identifying and removing rust accumulations, and refinishing affected areas with sealants, primers, and paints to slow the oxidation process. - valign=\\"top\\" 150px Sweep and wash deck. Excess water and salt on deck can lead to slipping hazards as well as accelerated rusting of the deck and equipment affixed to it. Ordinary seamen often bear the brunt of the swabbing duties, and many look forward to earning their able seaman's ticket and being done with swabbing. - valign=\\"top\\" 150px Splice wire and rope. A proficiency at splicing, knotting, and marlinspike seamanship have identified able seamen for centuries. In the modern merchant fleets, a proficiency for this sort of work is a requirement for certification as an able seaman. Thus, during the period of apprenticeship, it is customary for the crew to challenge an ordinary seaman, and call upon the OS to demonstrate these marlinspike seamanship skills at regular intervals, under the guidance of senior members of the deck department. - valign=\\"top\\" 150px Break out, rig, overhaul, and stow cargo-handling gear, stationary rigging, and running gear. Depending on the type of ship, it may undergo routine cargo onloads and offloads. On container ships and roll-on roll-off ships, this requires the staging of large amounts of equipment, such as twist-locks, braces, ratchet-straps, tie-down rods, and so forth. These are generally kept in storage during a voyage, so that they won't get thrown by the ship's movement. Thus, the ordinary seaman is often called upon to move this sort of equipment from storage areas to cargo areas. - valign=\\"top\\" 150px Secure cargo. Cargo must be secured, or fastened to the ship, when it is brought on board. Depending on the type of ship and the type of cargo, this process may be nearly automatic or a very customized operation. During a voyage, cargo is regularly checked to look for wear and tear, broken or compromised securements, shifting, or any other sort of noncompliance. If irregularities are found, the deck crew must respond by resecuring the cargo. Finally, near the end of the voyage, securements may be exercised or loosened to avoid problems with discharge. - valign=\\"top\\" 150px Launch and recover boats. One of the proficiencies that must be demonstrated to pass the examination for able seaman is a proficiency in all aspects of work with lifeboats. International regulations require merchant ships to run regular lifeboat drills, and the ordinary seaman is customarily given a variety of duties during these drills to become familiar and comfortable with launching, commanding, and retrieving a lifeboat. } On specialized vessels, an OS may have unique duties. For example, on research vessels, an OS may rig and operate hydrographic and other specialty winches; handle and stow oceanographic explosives; and stage and stow beach support equipment. Advancement=United States The next step on the career ladder for the ordinary seaman is to become an able seaman. This advancement is based on a number of factors laid out in the Code of Federal Regulations. =Training= AB's were in high demand during World War II.The Code of Federal Regulations establishes in 46 CFR 12.05 four categories of able seaman for the United States Merchant Marine: #Able Seaman‚ÄîAny Waters, Unlimited. Requires three years service on deck on vessels operating on the oceans or the Great Lakes. #Able Seaman‚ÄîLimited. Requires 18 months service on deck in vessels of 100 gross tons or more which operate in a service not exclusively confined to the rivers and smaller inland lakes of the United States. #Able Seaman‚ÄîSpecial. Requires 12 months service on deck on vessels operating on the oceans, or the navigable waters of the United States including the Great Lakes. #Able Seaman‚ÄîSpecial (OSV). Requires six months service on deck on vessels operating on the oceans, or the navigable waters of the United States including the Great Lakes. Time served in certain training programs and school ships may be substituted for the time of service listed above. Special certificates of service are available for Able Seaman, Great Lakes‚Äî18 months service; Able Seaman, Any waters‚Äî12 months; Able Seaman, Tugs and towboats‚Äîany waters; Able Seaman, Bays and sounds‚Äî12 months, vessels 500 gross tons or less not carrying passengers; and Able Seaman, Seagoing barges‚Äî12 months. =Examination requirements= For the United States Merchant Marine, the Code of Federal Regulations establishes in 46 CFR 12.05 examination requirements for the certification of able seamen, which includes: * Competence as a lifeboatman, including showing: # training in all the operations connected with the launching of lifeboats and life-rafts, and in the use of oars; # acquaintance with the practical handling of boats; including the ability to command the boat's crew. * An examination, conducted only in English, consisting of questions regarding: # lifeboats and life- rafts, the names of their essential parts, and a description of the required equipment; # the clearing away, swinging out and lowering of lifeboats and life-rafts, and handling of lifeboats under oars and sails, including questions relative to the proper handling of a boat in a heavy sea; # the operation and functions of commonly used types of davits; # knowledge of nautical terms; boxing the compass, either by degrees or points; running lights, passing signals, and fog signals for vessels on the high seas, in inland waters, or on the Great Lakes depending upon the waters on which the applicant has served; and distress signals; and, # knowledge of proper response to commands for handling the wheel and knowledge of the use of engine room telegraph or bell-pull signals. * In the actual demonstration, the applicant shall show ability by taking command of a boat and directing the operation of clearing away, swinging out, lowering the boat into the water, and acting as coxswain in charge of the boat under oars. The AB shall demonstrate ability to row by pulling an oar in the boat. The applicant shall also demonstrate knowledge of the principal knots, bends, splices, and hitches in common use by tying them. * The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, knowledge of pollution laws and regulations, procedures for discharge containment and cleanup, and methods for disposal of sludge and waste material from cargo and fueling operations.

They have been frequent antagonists of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Fictional character biography=Leland McCauley III Leland McCauley III was a wealthy tycoon and industrialist, one of the richest men in the galaxy, though not quite as rich as Legion of Super-Heroes benefactor R.J. Brande. This caused him no end of envy, and he always considered Brande a rival, though Brande seems to have considered him more of an annoyance at first. The Legion first gained his enmity after seemingly extorting him to pay them for their services in rescuing him. Although it was later revealed as a feint to capture a wily crime lord, and he was fully reimbursed, McCauley bore a deep grudge from then on. Later a rebellious son of his (not necessarily his namesake and heir) was saved by the Legion from a disgruntled former employee of his company. He was ultimately forced to retire after all his power and position in McCauley business interests were usurped by his ambitious son. Leland McCauley IV Leland McCauley IV resumed the vendetta against Brande. He employed an agent, Charon, to infiltrate Brande's staff on Brande's private planetoid. The agent was thwarted by members of the Legion, though the resulting attack caused a great deal of destruction and risked lives. When the Legion attempted to interrogate the agent, he replied that he knew they couldn't kill him because of the Legion code. Brande, who was not a member of the Legion, then threatened to kill him. Later the Legion broke into McCauley's fortified headquarters in the Himalayas to return the defeated assassin. =Five Years Later= One of McCauley's products, an \\"Omnicom\\" was featured prominently throughout the v4 Legion, including ones used by various Legionnaires to store and send messages, keep diaries, and so on. They appear to be a kind of personal communicator. His cousin Celeste (under the surname \\"Rockfish\\") becomes a member of the Legion. McCauley was apparently involved somewhat in the resistance movement against the Dominators, and emerged as a powerful political figure after the earth was freed from Dominion control, where he was allied with Universo. He ultimately captures his nemesis, R.J. Brande, his son Chameleon Boy, fellow Legionnaire Kid Quantum, and a group of Protean associates, and places them in a private statuary collection consisting of beings frozen in emerald energy. They are shortly rescued by a team of SW6 Legionnaires. McCauley subsequently claims they were merely enjoying his hospitality which his former captives do not deign to dispute. In the opening story-arc of Legionnaires, McCauley attempts to reform the Fatal Five as his personal supervillain team. Inevitably, they rebel against his control. It is revealed he is an extreme germaphobe who does not venture beyond his immaculately maintained habitat. Post-Zero Hour This McCauley resembled the younger version, but was not referred to as \\"IV\\". Once again a powerful industrialist, and again a rival of the Legion, to the point of funding his own private superhero team called the Workforce. He managed to lure Lightning Lad away from the Legion, and many pre-Zero Hour legionnaires were found in its ranks as well, including Karate Kid and Ultra Boy. His industrial activities made him many enemies, including Mano of the Fatal Five, whose world was poisoned by McCauley. Mano attempted to assassinate McCauley on his Lunar homebase, but was prevented by the Legion. Later, he hired Doctor Regulus whose experiments went out of control, dooming another world, and causing Leviathan to sacrifice himself in the process. He grants political asylum to Amelia Crugg of Khund and convinces both her and Legion wannabe Lori Morning (after learning of the teen's possession of the HERO dial) to join the Workforce. =Post-Legion Lost= Becoming a powerful political figure, after the events of Legion Lost the Legion returned to find McCauley was President of the United Planets. Again, he had a private superhero team, this time working for the presidency, which now included Mon-El. While fighting them, the Legion discovered the skeleton of Leland McCauley in a sewer, meaning the man claiming to be McCauley was an impostor. The impostor was eventually revealed as Ra's al Ghul.Legion #3 (February 2002) \\"Legion of Three Worlds\\" The Pre-Crisis version of McCauley appeared in the first issue of the \\"Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds\\" miniseries. He assassinated R.J. Brande, revealing to the United Planets council that the Legion benefactor was really a Durlan, before aging rapidly and turning to dust. It is implied that the Time Trapper had a hand in this event.Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds #3 (October 2008) Order of Purity During the \\"Battle for the Cowl\\" event, a 20th-century version of Leland McCauley appears in Gotham City as a member of the Order of Purity, helping to install the new Azrael. This version is apparently killed by a bullet to the head.Azrael: Death's Dark Knight #1 Powers and abilities Leland McCauley is an ordinary human being, and has no powers other than his vast wealth. He is intelligent, cunning, ruthless, and completely amoral.

He has held this position since 2001. Biography Rabbi Aharon Feldman is the son of Rabbi Joseph Feldman (died 1993), a native of Warsaw and scion of a rabbinical family. Rabbi Josef H. Feldman served as a rabbi in Manchester, New Hampshire in the 1930s, but left that post to assume the helm of Baltimore's Franklin Street Synagogue so his sons could attend a Hebrew day school. Archived at the Wayback Machine. He was the last rabbi to formally serve as chief rabbi of Baltimore. Rabbi Aharon Feldman has two brothers; his elder brother, Rabbi Emanuel Feldman, was the prominent spiritual leader of Congregation Beth Jacob of Atlanta, Georgia for 40 years. His younger brother, Rabbi Joel Feldman, was a former dean of Talmudical Academy of Baltimore. Rabbi Feldman was born and raised in Baltimore, where he attended the Talmudical Academy and Ner Yisroel, becoming a close disciple of Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Yitzchak Ruderman. Afterwards he taught in several yeshivas in New York. He has dual citizenship to both Israel and America, and is in line for a position as MK in the Israeli parliament in the Degal HaTorah party. In 1961 Rabbi Feldman and his wife Leah made aliyah with their family to Israel in order to raise their eight children in a more religious environment. They lived in Bnei Brak for 12 years and relocated to Jerusalem in 1973. Rabbi Feldman served as one of the Rosh Yeshivas of Ohr Somayach Yeshiva for many years, and also founded Yeshiva Be'er HaTorah in Jerusalem in the early 1990s. In 2001 Rabbi Feldman accepted the request of Ner Yisroel to serve as its Rosh Yeshiva. In 2005, he was one of 15 Jewish educators invited to an informal discussion on Jewish education in the White House's Roosevelt Room.Brown, Ellen Schur. \\"Bush hosts discussion on Jewish education\\", Cleveland Jewish News, December 16, 2005 Rabbi Feldman serves on the Moetzas Gedolai Hatorah of America.[11] Public positions In 1994, Rabbi Feldman spoke publicly against the actions of Baruch Goldstein saying that there could be \\"no justification\\", and describing the actions as \\"way beyond the pale\\".Lipman, Steve. \\"Way Beyond The Pale: Rabbis say Baruch Goldstein's murder rampage\\". Jewish Week, March 10, 1994. In 2003, in response to a question from Gil Student, Feldman issued a ruling regarding Chabad messianists. He drew a distinction between what he terms the \\"meshichists\\" (those who believe the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson is the messiah) and the \\"elokists\\" (those who believe he was a part of God or God \\"clothed in a body\\"). He ruled that it is forbidden to associate with elokists under any circumstances due to their heresy and that they cannot be counted for a minyan. Regarding the meshichists, he determined that while their beliefs do not make them heretics, it is forbidden to conduct any action which would be seen as lending credence to their messianic beliefs.http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/feldman.pdf See also Rabbi Feldman's letter to David Berger:http://www.stevens.edu/golem/llevine/feldman_berger_sm_2.jpg Feldman has penned a lengthy critical review of the Steinsaltz Talmud. Among many criticisms, he writes, \\"Specifically, the work is marred by an extraordinary number of inaccuracies stemming primarily from misreadings of the sources; it fails to explain those difficult passages which the reader would expect it to explain; and it confuses him with notes which are often irrelevant, incomprehensible, and contradictory.\\" Feldman says he fears that, \\"An intelligent student utilizing the Steinsaltz Talmud as his personal instructor might in fact conclude that Talmud in general is not supposed to make sense.\\" Furthermore, writes Feldman, the Steinsaltz Talmud gives off the impression that the Talmud is intellectually flabby, inconsistent, and often trivial. In 2005, he wrote a critique of Rabbi Natan Slifkin, explaining and defending the 2004 ban issued against Slifkin's books. Feldman has been an opponent of Open Orthodoxy. He argues that \\"The basis of Orthodox Judaism is a belief in the Divine origin of both the Oral and Written Torah. Yeshivat Chovevei Torah‚Äôs leaders or their graduates have said clearly or implicitly on many occasions that they do not accept that the Torah was authored by Hashem, that parts of the Torah can be excised, and that the Oral Law was developed by Rabbis to adjust the Written Torah to the realities of the time that they lived in. This basic philosophy is what writes them out of Orthodox Jewry.\\" Selected bibliography Mishnah Berurah: The Classic Commentary to Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim, Comprising the Laws of Daily Jewish Conduct (editor, Hebrew-English edition, 12 volumes) *Yad L'Peah on Maseches Peah (1967) (Book Review in HaPardes; digital edition of Yad L'Peah at the Ner Israel Archive).

Transportation Ashburn is easily accessible from Highway 407, which begins 17 kilometres south-west of the hamlet in the village of Brougham. Highway 7 and Highway 12 pass through the neighbouring hamlet of Myrtle, 3 kilometres east of Ashburn, leading south through Whitby to Highway 401 (17 kilometres) and north to the Trans-Canada Highway (35 kilometres). Myrtle Road is an important local east-west corridor, which has created safety concerns for walkers around the hamlet's main intersection at Ashburn Road.Town of Whitby, Official Plan Review: Participant Feedback Summary.

In 1990, Via Rail ceased passenger service on the Havelock-Peterborough-Toronto line, which runs across the northern edge of Ashburn and stops in the neighbouring hamlet of Myrtle Station. In recent years, there has been significant local, federal and provincial support for a plan to restore passenger service to this line.Cf. Greg Gormick, Transportation Policy Advisor, Shining Waters Railway, January 11, 2011; MetroLinx (Greater Toronto Transportation Authority), Peterborough Rail Study: Final Report, vol. 1, Feb. 2010. The station would complement growth projections for the north end of Whitby. A future opportunity and challenge to the community of Ashburn and its neighbours is the proposed development of an international airport 12 kilometers west of the village on the Pickering Airport lands. Under the current plan, the approach for one of the three landing strips would be directly south of Ashburn, with planes descending near the hamlet from an elevation of 521 metres to 480 metres. The plan anticipates 11.9 million passengers per year (or 32,600 per day) by 2032.Cf. Transport Canada, Plan Showing Pickering Airport Site; also Greater Toronto Airports Authority, Pickering Airport Draft Plan Report, 2004.

A post is cemented into a prepared root canal, which retains a core restoration, which retains the final crown. The role of the post is firstly to retain a core restoration and crown, and secondly to redistribute stresses down onto the root, thereby reducing the risk of coronal fracture. The post does not play any role in reinforcing or supporting the tooth and can in fact make it more likely to fracture at the root. When deciding whether or not a tooth requires a post and core crown rather than a conventional crown, the following must be established: # Presence of an adequate ferrule (coronal tooth structure) # Sufficient length of canal to retain a post # Curvature and overall anatomy of root canal system # Sufficient root (radicular) dentine thickness for post preparation # Restorability of tooth The benefit of placing a post into a root canal is improved retention of the crown. However, there are also disadvantages, during the preparation for the post space there is a risk of perforation, a post can also make a tooth more likely to fracture, it makes future orthograde root canal treatment much more difficult and finally it is very destructive and requires excessive removal of tooth tissue. The presence of ferrule can increase the fracture resistance of the post. Posts are more commonly required for anterior teeth rather than posterior teeth. The primary reason for this is that multi-rooted teeth have a large pulp chamber which can be utilised for retention of the core and therefore the crown, whereas anterior teeth are much smaller and less retentive. When it is not possible to retain a core on a posterior tooth and a post is required, no more than one post should be used per tooth, and this should be placed in the largest canal available. This is because more than one preparation for a post will involve excessive dentine removal and increase the fracture risk. A better alternative to posts on a posterior tooth is core restoration which extends down into the entrance of the root canal through the Nayyar technique using an amalgam dowel‚Äìcore. In this technique, retention for the amalgam-core is derived from the remaining pulp chamber and the prepared canals by extending amalgam to these areas. ProcedurePost and cores divide into two main groups: prefabricated and cast. Both of these systems employ a post that is placed within the root canal of the tooth being restored. Thus the tooth must first be endodontically treated. After the endodontic procedure has been completed, and the root canal(s) is/are filled with the inert gutta percha root canal filling material, some gutta percha is removed from the canal space. Gutta percha can be removed mechanically (use of Gates Glidden), thermally (use of System B Tip), and chemically (use of chemical solvents, however this method is not advocated nowadays due to difficulty in controlling the depth of softening) The space that exists coronal to the remaining gutta percha, called the post space, is now available within which to place a post. It is desirable to leave sufficient root filling material in the apical area to maintain an apical seal. This procedure does not even require local anesthesia as the tooth has long been dead after the root canal treatment and no pain is felt. Post length The post on the left is a tapered post, the one on the right is a parallel post In post and core fabrication, it is desirable that the post descends at least two-thirds of the length of root canal (or not less than the height of the crown) in order to provide sufficient retention. Width of post should be taken into account for maximum strength and resistance to fracture, however, it should not be too broad as this would lead to lateral perforation and root fracture. It is important to leave at least 4 mm-5 mm of gutta percha at the apex of the root canal, even at the expense of a longer post, because it is within the apical 4 mm of the root canal that the apical delta anastomose with the exterior surface of the root. Should these lateral canals not be blocked with the gutta percha and the cement used to place the gutta percha, the chances of microleakage and percolation of microbes are greatly increased, thereby increasing the likelihood of an endodontic failure. It is not necessarily the length of the post within the root canal that provides for retention of the core, and thus the eventual crown, but rather the length of post that will exist within root structure that exists within surrounding bone. If the post is 16 mm long, but only extends 4 mm into root structure that is surrounded by solid bone, the restoration will have a poor prognosis. This consideration of crown-to-root ratio is essential when evaluating the tooth for a crown-lengthening procedure. In the picture at right, the two teeth on the extreme left and right are the ones under discussion. The two teeth in the middle have been endodontically treated, but do not have post and cores. Types=Prefabricated post Maxillary posterior teeth restored with prefabricated screw posts Prefabricated post and cores take less time to place, as they do not involve any lab work and can be inserted immediately upon the decision to utilize them, once the endodontic therapy has been completed and the post space cleared of gutta percha. After the prefabricated post is properly cemented into the post space, a core material, such as dental composite, can be packed around the cemented post. After the material has been cured or has had a chance to set and properly formed into a crown preparation, an impression can be taken for the fabrication of a prosthetic crown. Metal prefabricated post systems are being superseded by fibre-reinforced composite resin post systems which offer improved resistance to untreatable fracture of tooth substrate such as vertical root fracture. Cast post In cases where the post space is not a good match for a prefabricated post, a cast post and core can be custom fabricated for the tooth. A resin pattern is produced by placing a preformed plastic \\"burnout\\" post into the post space and a resin material, such as Duralay resin, is used to build up the tooth to the proper dimensions. When this is completed, the pattern resin/plastic post is removed from the tooth structure and attached to a sprue former, much in the same way as a is done with the wax pattern of a crown, and a single-unit cast post and core can thus be fabricated out of gold, titanium or another metal using the lost-wax technique. Alternatively, an impression can be taken of the post space and dental arch using a plastic post and a polyvinyl siloxane impression material, and this used to construct a suitable post in the dental laboratory.  Materials used for posts  Posts can be made from non-metallic materials and metals.  Non-metallic Overall, non-metallic posts show a lower incidence of root fracture due to their ability to resist high stress without permanent deformation and breaking. Non-metallic posts should not be used if there is insufficient sound tooth tissue (ferrule). The sound tooth tissue should be at least 1.5 mm circumferentially further apical to the core. Non- metallic posts are also more aesthetic than metal posts as metal posts will shine through all-ceraminc restorations and non-metallic posts' optical properties are closer to tooth tissue (except for carbon fibre posts due to the darker material). Non-metallic posts are easier to remove from teeth if needed than metal posts. Direct use of non-metallic posts in the most common use but they can also be built up in the laboratory. = Zirconia = Zirconia posts have high strength. However, they are brittle and have a high modulus which can potentially lead to root fracture. It can be difficult to remove the posts if needed. Zirconium posts can't be etched, thus leading to difficulty in retention of composite core. = Ceramic = Ceramic posts are made from a brittle material. These posts can be too strong which can lead to root fracture. It can be difficult and even impossible to remove a ceramic post. = Fibre reinforced resins = Fibre reinforced resins are a form of non-metallic posts and include carbon fibre, fibreglass and woven polyethylene ribbon-reinforced composites. These posts are more flexible, more aesthetic, and they have similar properties to dentine. However, they can only used when there is sufficient tooth tissue remaining as they can delaminate upon exposure to moisture and this can lead to post failure.  Carbon fibre  Carbon fibre posts show very little deformation and are able to absorb and transfer forces similarly to dentine. However, these posts can be dark in colour which may lead to an unaesthetic result as the post can shine through the tooth.  Glass fibre/ fibreglass  Glass fibre posts are less brittle than ceramic posts. Posts that have unidirectional fibres are the strongest. However, it is difficult to produce this type of material as fibre bundles require infiltration and wetting with resin. This process can often leave voids on the surface of the fibres, leading to a weakened structure.  Metals Traditionally metal posts have been used due to the good corrosion resistance and high yield strength. = Prefabricated metal posts = Stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy and gold alloy are used to construct prefabricated posts. These type of posts are usually placed in the post space and the core is constructed with a direct restorative core material. There are also prefabricated posts for which cores are cast onto. These posts are usually made of Type IV gold alloy (containing gold, platinum, palladium and iridium) or platinum, gold and iridium alloys, which are compatible with palladium and silver-free alloys or platinum, gold, palladium and silver alloy. = Cast metal posts = Often a metal alloy such as Type IV gold alloy is used. Post design There are many types of post designed available for post and cores, utilizing various combinations of the following properties: *parallel vs. tapered *smooth-sided vs. serrated vs. threaded *post only vs. with additional single-circle ring In a classic case one of the best design for a post to decrease the risk of failure is the narrowest and longest smooth, parallel post that one can fit into the post space. Utilizing the longest possible post ensures that the forces transmitted from the crown are distributed over as much of the root as possible. Using the appropriate diameter post ensures that as much natural tooth structure as possible is left to support the post and absorb the transmitted forces. A parallel post ensures the greatest retention of the post within the canal, and is perhaps utilized with only the slightest loss of tooth structure to the internal wall of the canal. A smooth-surfaced post transmits all the forces apically, which can cause fracture. Threaded or roughened posts, however, distribute the forces along the canal and are also more retentive than smooth posts. The ideal post is therefore parallel and threaded/roughened. The use of a post and core does not strengthen the tooth prior to restoration with a crown; rather, it may contribute to the weakening of the tooth structure, as the forces placed upon the future prosthetic crown and core are now transmitted along virtually the entire length of the brittle, endodontically treated tooth. This inherent drawback is taken into account when the prognosis of the finished restoration is determined and explained to the patient prior to the onset of treatment. It is because of this increased risk of failure inherent in the use of post and core restorations that, when all of the independent failure rates of the many procedures needed for the restoration of the tooth are considered together (endodontic treatment, crown lengthening (when indicated), post and core and prosthetic crown), the patient is sometimes advised to have the tooth extracted and an implant placed. The post with additional single-circle ring increases the contact surface area between the core and involved hard tissue of tooth significantly, therefore this system does not require a post with at least 2/3 of the root canal depth as its indication.  Impressions  To ensure accurate recording of the preparation and finish line, gingival retraction is needed. Its use displaces the gingival tissues long enough to allow the impression material to flow down below the margin preparation lines and into the orifice. The use of the gingival retraction cord is a safe method as when used correctly will not harm the gingival tissues whilst ensuring the detail recorded is of good quality. The various types of gingival retraction cords that can be used are twisted, braided and knitted. The use of all three requires pre-soaking in either water or an agent that encourages haemostasis. The haemostatic agent controls gingival haemorrhage following the preparation and prior to impression making. Once the cord has been left in place for the required length of time, it is removed allowing the sulcus to be rinsed and dried in order to prevent the haemostatic agent from creating problems with the set of the impression material. The two methods used for making impressions for post and cores are outlined below.  Direct technique  * The material used with the post to create the pattern for both the post and core is a self-cure acrylic resin * The wall of the canal is lubricated before the self-cure resin is placed within the intra-radicular portion of the canal around the post to ensure it has adhered and adapted to the post correctly * Once set, the post is removed and examined for deficiencies. If any deficiencies are present that are not minor enough to be managed with wax, a remake of the impression will be required * Once satisfied with the post, the core portion is built-up before it is refined to achieve the desired shape * The occlusal clearance is assessed and the pattern is examined for a final time before sending to the laboratory for casting  Indirect technique  * The post is bevelled to ensure a better fit within the canal as the preparation for the post will end in a point due to the instruments used for the preparation * The post is then seated to the correct length and tested to confirm it resists displacement * The occlusal end is trimmed until it is at the same level as the adjacent teeth and is made retentive with the use of a heated instrument. Lubricant is painted on the portion lying within the canal to aid its removal * Gingival retraction as described above is completed * A light bodied addition silicone material is syringed in the orifice and around the prep ensuring the prep is completely covered, before a heavier bodied addition silicone material in a stock tray is seated over the prep to make the impression of the full arch * Once set the impression should be removed with the post embedded in-situ * Finally, an impression is made of the opposing arch References * * Category:Restorative dentistry ","title":"Post and core"},{"id":"10141738","text":"Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake is a United States military facility in California.

It existed from 1924 until 2014, when it was superseded by the Court of Appeal, which can hear appeals for all types of case. Operation The Court of Criminal Appeal heard appeals for indictable offences tried in the Circuit Court, the Central Criminal Court, and the Special Criminal Court. The Court sat in a division of three, with one Supreme Court judge and two High Court judges. The court could hear appeals by a defendant against conviction, sentence or both. Leave to appeal was only given where there was a disagreement on a point of law, although an exception can be made when new evidence becomes available which could not have been presented before the original court. The Director of Public Prosecutions could also appeal against a sentence on the grounds that it was unduly lenient. A further appeal to the Supreme Court only lay when the Court of Criminal Appeal itself or the Attorney General certified that a point of law of exceptional public importance needed to be resolved. History=Before independence The Crown Cases Act 1848 established a Court for Crown Cases Reserved in each of England and Wales and Ireland. These courts were sometimes called the \\"Court of Criminal Appeal\\", but only heard point of law appeals. In England and Wales, a Court of Criminal Appeal was established in 1907, but in Ireland the 1848 court remained in operation. A Court of Criminal Appeal was temporarily established during the Irish Land War by the Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act, 1882. This comprised the judges of the Supreme Court of Judicature except for the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The 1882 Act expired after three years. After independence The Courts of Justice Act 1924 established a new court system under the terms of the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State. These included a new Supreme Court and High Court, and a Court of Criminal Appeal comprising judges of those two courts. The courts were re-established in 1961 under the terms of the current (1937) Constitution. The Court of Criminal Appeal was replaced on 5 November 2014 by the Court of Appeal, as mandated by the 33rd Amendment of the Constitution passed in 2013.

The word nitride refers to the ‚àí3 oxidation state of the nitrogen bound to the uranium. Uranium nitride has been considered as a potential fuel for nuclear reactors. It is said to be safer, stronger, denser, more thermally conductive and having a higher temperature tolerance. Challenges to implementation of the fuel include a complex conversion route from enriched UF6, the need to prevent oxidation during manufacturing and the need to define and license a final disposal route. The necessity to use expensive, highly isotopically enriched 15N is a significant factor to overcome. This is necessary due to the (relatively) high neutron capture cross-section of the far more common 14N, which reduces the neutron economy and thus efficiency of a reactor.{{cite journal last1=Chaudri first1=Khurrum Saleem title=Coupled analysis for new fuel design using UN and UC for SCWR journal=Progress in Nuclear Energy volume=63 year=2013 plages=57-65 doi=10.1016/j.pnucene.2012.11.001 Synthesis=Carbothermic reduction The common techniques for generating UN is carbothermic reduction of uranium oxide (UO2) in a 2 step method illustrated below. :3UO2 \\\\+ 6C ‚Üí 2UC + UO2 \\\\+ 4CO (in argon, > 1450 ¬∞C for 10 to 20 hours) :4UC + 2UO2 +3N2 ‚Üí 6UN + 4CO Sol-gel Sol-gel methods and arc melting of pure uranium under nitrogen atmosphere can also be used.Ganguly, C.; Hegde, P. J. Sol-Gel Sci. Technol.. 1997, 9, 285. Ammonolysis Another common technique for generating UN2 is the ammonolysis of uranium tetrafluoride. Uranium tetrafluoride is exposed to ammonia gas under high pressure and temperature, which replaces the fluorine with nitrogen and generates hydrogen fluoride.Silva, G. W. C.; Yeamans, C. B.; Ma, L.; Cerefice, G. S.; Czerwinski, K. R.; Sarrelberger, A. P. Chem. Mater.. 2008, 20, 3076. Hydrogen fluoride is a colourless gas at this temperature and mixes with the ammonia gas. Hydriding-nitriding An additional method of UN synthesis employs fabrication directly from metallic uranium. By exposing metallic uranium to hydrogen gas at temperatures in excess of 280 ¬∞C, UH3 can be formed.urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-35249: Manufacturing methods for (U-Zr)N-fuels Furthermore, since UH3 has a higher specific volume than the metallic phase, hybridation can be used to physically decompose otherwise solid uranium. Following hybridation, UH3 can be exposed to a nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures around 500 ¬∞C, thereby forming U2N3.

It has also been proposed as nuclear fuel in some fast neutron nuclear test reactors. UN is considered superior because of its higher fissionable density, thermal conductivity and melting temperature than the most common nuclear fuel, uranium oxide (UO2), while also demonstrating lower release of fission product gases and swelling, and decreased chemical reactivity with cladding materials. It also has a superior mechanical, thermal and radiation stability compared to standard metallic uranium fuel.Mizutani, A.; Sekimoto, H. Ann. Nucl. Energy. 2005, 25(9), 623‚Äì638. The thermal conductivity is on the order of 4-8 times higher than that of uranium dioxide, the most commonly used nuclear fuel, at typical operating temperatures. Increased thermal conductivity results a lower thermal gradient between inner and outer sections of the fuel, potentially allowing for higher operating temperatures and reducing macroscopic restructuring of the fuel, which limits fuel lifetime.

The covalent portion of the bonds forms from the overlap between the 6d orbital and 7s orbital on the uranium and the 2p orbitals on the nitrogen.√âvarestov, R. A., Panin, A. I., & Losev, M. V.

Uranium nitrido derivatives Recently, there have been many developments in the synthesis of complexes with terminal uranium nitride (‚ÄìU‚â°N) bonds. In addition to radioactive concerns common to all uranium chemistry, production of uranium nitrido complexes has been slowed by harsh reaction conditions and solubility challenges. Nonetheless, syntheses of such complexes have been reported in the past few years, for example the three shown below among others.Nocton, G.; P√©caut, J.; Mazzanti, M.

History The Polish language started to change after the baptism of Poland, which caused an influx of Latin words, such as ko≈õci√≥≈Ç \\"church\\" (Latin castellum, \\"castle\\"), anio≈Ç \\"angel\\" (Latin angelus). Many of them were borrowed via Czech, which, too, influenced Polish in that era (hence e.g. wiesio≈Çy \\"happy, blithe\\" (cf. wiesio≈Çek) morphed into modern Polish weso≈Çy, with the original vowels and the consonants of Czech vesel√Ω). Also, in later centuries, with the onset of cities founded on German law (namely, the so- called Magdeburg law), Middle High German urban and legal words filtered into Old Polish. Around the 14th or 15th centuries the aorist and imperfect became obsolete. In the 15th century the dual fell into disuse except for a few fixed expressions (adages, sayings). In relation to most other European languages, though, the differences between Old and Modern Polish are comparatively slight; the Polish language is somewhat conservative relative to other Slavic languages. That said, the relatively slight differences between Old and Modern Polish are unremarkable considering that the chronological stages of other European languages that Old Polish is contemporary with are generally not very different from the Modern stages and many of them already labelled \\"Early Modern\\"; Old Polish includes texts that were written as late as the Renaissance.  Spelling  The difficulty the medieval scribes had to face was attempting to codify the language was the inadequacy of the Latin alphabet to some sounds of the Polish language, for example cz, sz. Thus, Old Polish does not have a standard spelling. One letter could give several sounds - e.g. s can be read as s, sz or ≈õ. Writing words was almost entirely consistent with the spelling of Latin, for example. Bichek - Byczek, Gneuos - Gniewosz etc.  Earliest written sentence  \\"Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\\", highlighted in red The Book of Henryk√≥w (, ), contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language: Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai (pronounced originally as: Daj, uƒá ja pobrusza, a ti pocziwaj, modern Polish: Daj, niech ja pomielƒô, a ty odpoczywaj or Pozw√≥l, ≈ºe ja bƒôdƒô mieli≈Ç, a ty odpocznij, English: Come, let me grind, and you take a rest), written around 1270. The medieval recorder of this phrase, the Cistercian monk Peter of the Henryk√≥w monastery, noted that \\"Hoc est in polonico\\" (\\"This is in Polish\\").Digital version Book of Henryk√≥w in latinBarbara i Adam Podg√≥rscy: S≈Çownik gwar ≈õlƒÖskich.

Wroc≈Çaw: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wroc≈Çawskiego, 1999, Alphabet= Parkoszowic  About 1440 , a professor of Jagiellonian University, tried to codify the Polish alphabet. He wrote the first tract on Polish orthographic rules (in Latin) and rhyme Obiecado (in Polish). The reform consisted in the introduction of round and unrounded letters on the distinction between hard (velarized) and soft (palatalized) consonants. It also contained merging double vowels to a long vowel, for example: aa ‚Äì /aÀê/. Parkoszowic's proposal was not adopted, and his theoretical concepts had no followers.  Phonetics  Over the centuries Old Polish pronunciation was subjected to numerous modifications. These are only the most basic ones. The consonant system transferred into the soft coronal consonants, for example for . Many consonant clusters were simplified; which in the process made assimilation reverse many consonants in words, before that following a voiceless consonant.

Short Film Forum was formed at a time when mainstream Bangladeshi cinema was dominated by crass commercialism and a network of producers-distributors-exhibitors which allowed no space for artistic or socially responsible films. The Forum featured some of most notable young Bangladeshi film makers among its members, including Morshedul Islam, Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud, Enayet Karim Babul, Tareq Shahrier, Shameem Akhter, Manjare Hasin Murad, Yasmin Kabir, Nurul Alam Atique, Zahidur Rahim Anjan, Rashed Chowdhury, and Akram Khan.Short Film Festival Newsletter, issue ??, 2007 Bangladesh Short Film Forum now has its own film center in Shahbag, Dhaka with an auditorium, a library, an archive and an administrative office. The Forum is mostly noted for organizing the biennial and non- competitive International Short and Independent Film Festival. The first festival was held in 1988, and was the first festival in the Indian Sub- continent which was entirely dedicated to short films. The Forum produced a number of short films, including One Day in Krishnanagar (53 minutes) and Dhaka 2005 (5 minutes).

The grades range from nursery to 8th grade and there can be more than one class per grade depending on how many students there are.  Founders = Janie C. Whitney  The school was founded by Ms. Janie C. Whitney who has led the development of the school for over 20 years. Ms. Whitney was born in Cuthbert, Georgia. She attended Long Island University and studied accounting. She had always had a love for children and opened a day-care and after-school program in Bushwick, New York. In 1983, she became co-founder of Bethlehem Baptist Academy. As time went on the school became very productive and showed a strong will to build up a strong academic curriculum with good more character within its students.  A.B. Whitfield A.B. Whitfield was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. He pursued many high school and college activities such as football, wrestling and track. He would later go on to play professional football. After he retired from football, he went on to earn a master's degree in education. He is the administrator and co owner of Trey Whitfield School. He has 35 years of educational experience and is retired from the NYC Board of Education where he was a teacher for 17 years, taught at elementary school level. He and Janie have also established the \\"Trey Whitfield Foundation\\" in memory of their son.  Name change  The school was originally known as Bethlehem Baptist Academy when it opened, but changed its name when the founders' son Trey Whitfield died in a boating accident while he was a senior attending Brewster Academy. The name change is seen as a tribute to their son who was considered an all-around good person.

Flora Elephant nettle at Eaglenest WS In Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary there is a camp named Sessni which in Nepali language means nettle. The place is filled with poisonous elephant nettles on either side of the road. Conservation Blyth's tragopan Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary is physically protected from timber and animal poaching only by its isolation and the poor quality of the one lane road leading inside it. It is administered by the Divisional Forest Officer, Shergaon Forest Division, Rupa (Millo Tasser, IFS). He is assisted by a Range Forest Office in Singchung and Beat Forest Offices in Ramalingam (close to Singchung) and Khellong. The absence of any settlement inside Eaglenest has minimized any problem of hunting. The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), a consortium of major international and regional organizations, has identified the Eastern Himalayan region around Arunachal Pradesh (Nepal, Bhutan and all of Northeast India) as a critical global biodiversity rich area deserving of conservation focus. They identified the North Bank Landscape (i.e., north bank of Brahmaputra, extending up the Eaglenest slopes) and the Tawang region as worthy of particular focus.Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, Project database Eastern Himalayas Region Strategic Directions Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary is in the Conservation International Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot area.Conservation International (2007) Himalaya - conservation action and protected areas, retrieved 10/1/2007 Himalaya - conservation action and protected areas BirdLife International has designated Eaglenest and Sessa sanctuaries as an Important Bird Area (IBA IN344), with Blyth's tragopan identified as a vulnerable species of the area.BirdLife International (2006) BirdLife IBA Factsheet, retrieved 10/1/2007 IN344 Eaglenest and Sessa Sanctuaries This area is extremely important for the continued well-being of the Asian elephant. Elephants regularly move up from the Assam plains to the Eaglenest ridge at 3250 m in summer, perhaps the highest altitude that elephants reach in India. Extensive clearing of forests through illegal encroachments in Assam adjacent to Eaglenest has exacerbated elephant-human conflict in the plains; it has also meant that elephants now have to stay longer in the Eaglenest area and may lead to depletion of their food resource by dominating the rate of regeneration.

History For many years, Cleburne was the site of a major locomotive backshop of the Santa Fe Railroad, and many shop buildings can be seen on the east side of the track. The 1898 two-story brick depot was scaled down to one floor and ultimately demolished during the 1990s to make way for a road improvement project. Cleburne became the northern end of the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway in 1904, with the portion from Teague now abandoned. Cleburne's current intermodal station, built in 1999, serves Amtrak trains and is the office for Cletran, the local bus transit. In recent history, the station has become less prestigious and the surrounding buildings have become mostly abandoned. The station is unstaffed, and all tickets must be purchased in advance; there is not even a Quik-Trak kiosk.

It is located about 17 Kilometers south of the town of Forchheim and 15 Kilometers to the east of the city of Erlangen, and is part of the administration community Dormitz.  History  Kleinsendelbach was first mentioned in 1062. It was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg and therefore from 1500 onward part of the Franconian Circle during the Holy Roman Empire. After 1803 the village was ceded to Bavaria where it was declared a municipality in 1818. Despite its comparably small size as a municipality, Kleinsendelbach's independence was untouched by the territorial reforms of 1972 and 1978 though it has joined the administrative community Dormitz along with two neighboring municipalities.  Additional Information = Politics  The presiding mayor is Gertrud Werner since 2008 along with the second mayor Josef Elsinger. The regional council consists of 12 members and the mayor, none of which are part of a major party.  Coat of arms  Kleinsendelbach's coat of arms consists of a silver wolf's head on a blue background, a black lion head on a yellow background, and white and red stripes in the middle.  Sights  In 1982, Kleinsendelbach was awarded with the title of the most beautiful village in the Forchheim district. There is one church (St. Heinrich, built 1952) and three chapels.

This approach combines user interfaces, models of computation, math and analysis, Input/output signals, technology abstractions, and various deployment target. It allows domain experts, or non- implementation experts, to access to design capabilities where they would traditionally need to outsource a system design expert. This approach to system design is a super-set of electronic system-level (ESL) design. Graphical system design expands on the EDA-based ESL definition to include other types of embedded system design including industrial machines and medical devices. Many of these expanded applications can be defined as \\"the long tail\\" applications.  System-level design  Graphical system design is an approach to designing an entire system, using more intuitive graphical software and off-the-shelf (non-custom) hardware devices to refine the design, create initial prototypes and even use for the few run of deployments. The approach may involve Algorithm engineering. The approach can prove successful when designers need to get something to market quickly (medical video: ) or with a team of non-embedded experts like Boston Engineering to create a mechatronics-based machine. > \\"Graphical system design is a complementary but encompassing platform-based > approach that includes embedded and electronic system design, > implementation, and verification tools. ESL and graphical system design are > really part of the same movement--higher abstraction and more design > automation looking to solve the real engineering challenges that designers > are facing today--addressing design flaws that are introduced at the > specification stage to ensure they're detected well before validation for > on-time product delivery.\\"  Tools  Graphical system design relies on open connectivity. For example, tools that can be used in the design phase include (in alphabetical order): Ansoft Designer, AutoCAD, CarSim, DOORS, Dymola, LabVIEW, MSC.Adams, NI Multisim, NEi Nastran, SolidWorks, SPICE, OpenWire (library). The prototyping stage is more about taking algorithm design and implementing them on hardware for higher quality designs. An effective prototyping platform includes a high- level language, real-time processors, FPGA logic, modular I/O and any intellectual property needed. The deploy stage is mostly about hardware - where you put your design in the final stage. This may involve MPUs or FPGAs.

During the French and Indian War, Rutherford became a captain of a local British colonial militia. He continued serving in the militia until the start of the revolution in 1775, at which time he enlisted in the North Carolina militia as a colonel. He was appointed to the post of brigadier general of the \\"Salisbury District Brigade\\" in May 1776, and participated in the initial phases of the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars against the Cherokee Indians along the frontier. In June 1780, he was partly responsible for the Loyalist defeat in the Battle of Ramsour's Mill. Rutherford was present at the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780, where he was taken prisoner by the British. After being exchanged in 1781, Rutherford participated in several other campaigns, including further attacks on the Chickamauga faction of the Cherokee. Originally from Ireland, Rutherford immigrated with his parents to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Colony, at the age of eighteen. In 1753 he moved to Rowan County, in the Province of North Carolina, where he married Elizabeth Graham. An active member of his community, Rutherford served in multiple civil occupations. He was a representative of both houses of the North Carolina House of Commons, as well as an unsuccessful candidate for governor. Rutherford was an advocate of the anti-federalist movement and was appointed President of the Legislative Council of the Southwest Territory in 1794. Rutherford retired to Sumner County, Tennessee, where he died on August 10, 1805, at the age of 84. Early life Little is known about Griffith Rutherford's early life. Born in Ireland in either 1721 or 1731MacDonald p. 11 to John Rutherford, who was of Ulster Scots descent, and Elizabeth (n√©e Griffin), who was of Welsh descent,Ashe p. 381 he appears clearly in records after his immigration to Philadelphia at the age of eighteen.Wakelyn p. 176 His parents died during the voyage from Ireland, and for a while he worked on a relative's farm, where he was taught how to survey land.MacDonald p. 13 Around 1753, he moved to Rowan County, North Carolina Colony, and bought a tract of land about seven miles (11 km) from Salisbury; this was the first of several land purchases he made during the 1750s.MacDonald p. 21 The following year Rutherford married his neighbor's sister, Elizabeth Graham, who eventually bore him ten children.MacDonald p. 22 One of their sons, James Rutherford, later became a major during the Revolutionary War, dying at the Battle of Eutaw Springs.Ashe p. 382 Rutherford also became friends with Daniel Boone during this time, with whom he often went on hunting and surveying expeditions.MacDonald p. 20 After the French and Indian War, Rutherford became increasingly active in community affairs. He was listed as a member of the North Carolina General Assembly in 1766, a sheriff and justice of the peace of Rowan County from 1767 to 1769, and a tax collector.Clark p. 575 French‚ÄìIndian War Rutherford began his extensive military career in 1760 during the French and Indian War. He was a participant in several battles and skirmishes, most notably the Battle of Fort Duquesne (1758); the battle at Fort Dobbs (1760); and James Grant's campaign against the Cherokee in the southern Appalachians (1761). By the war's end, he had achieved the rank of captain.MacDonald p. 28 Between 1769 and 1771, he embraced the cause against the rebels during the Regulator Movement, commanding a local militia which participated in the Battle of Alamance (May 16, 1771). The following month, Rutherford retired to Salem to recover from an acute attack of gout.MacDonald p. 50 Revolutionary War Rutherford entered the war in 1775 as a colonel in the North Carolina militia following his appointment to the Rowan County Committee of Safety.MacDonald p. 55 Throughout that year, his regiment helped to disarm and disperse Loyalist groups in the South Carolina back country, most notably during the Snow Campaign in Ninety Six, South Carolina.MacDonald p. 56 Rutherford represented Rowan County at the Fourth Provincial Congress in Halifax from April 4 to May 14, 1776, during which he helped develop and write the Constitution of North Carolina and was promoted to brigadier general of the Salisbury District Brigade.Hunter p. 176 In the summer following the conference, he raised an army of 2,400 men to campaign against local Cherokee Indians, who had been attacking colonists on the western frontier since their alliance with the British. Campaign against the Cherokee Rutherford's regiment rendezvoused at Fort McGahey with the Guilford and Surry County regiments under Colonels James Martin and Martin Armstrong on July 23, 1776. From there, the three groups traveled through the Blue Ridge Mountains at the Swannanoa Gap, passed up the valley of Hominy Creek, and crossed the Pigeon River. They then passed through Richland Creek, near the present day town of Waynesville, North Carolina, and crossed the Tuckasegee River near an Indian settlement. They moved further onwards towards the Cowee Gap, where they had a small engagement with a band of Cherokee, in which one of Rutherford's men was wounded. After that conflict, they marched to the Overhill Cherokee \\"Middle Towns\\" (on the Tennessee River), where he met General Andrew Williamson of South Carolina on September 14Hunter p. 177 at Hiwassee. Williamson was on a similar mission and readily joined forces with the original three regiments. Map of the route taken by Rutherford, known today as the Rutherford Trace The now four regiments skirmished with hostile Indians at Valley Town, Ellijay, and near the southern Watauga settlements (present day northeast Tennessee). Eventually, the Indian tribes were subdued at the cost of three fatalities to Rutherford's regiment. Casualties to the Indians, however, were severe. By the end of the conflict, the four regiments had destroyed 36 Indian towns, decimated acres of corn farms, and chased off most of the Indians' cattle.Wheeler p. 384 Afterward, Rutherford returned home by the same route. He arrived back in Salisbury in early October, where he disbanded his troops. Later that month, Rutherford authorized another punitive expedition of a recently raised cavalry force, led by Captain William Moore joined by Captain Joseph Harden of the Tryon County Regiment (North Carolina), to attack the Middle Towns.Letter from Griffith Rutherford to Samuel Ashe; September 1, 1776; \\"Colonial and State Records of North Carolina;\\" University Library, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; accessed January 2016 Southern theater British strategists viewed the Southern colonies, especially lightly populated Georgia, as the most vulnerable of all. Despite early victories won by the Patriots at Charleston and other settlements, the South became the focus of English attack starting in 1778. Governor Richard Caswell of North Carolina identified this threat and immediately ordered militia to regroup. Rutherford, who had been checking on Loyalists since his return to Salisbury in 1776, received word of this by October.MacDonald pp. 113‚Äì114 Governor Caswell and Rutherford met in Kinston, North Carolina, on November 25 to discuss the specifics of Rutherford's assignment. Apparently a fleet of British ships were en route from New York, heavily endangering key coastal cities. Rutherford was able to amass a force which reached the border of South Carolina by early December. They proceeded to establish headquarters near Savannah in Purrysburg, South Carolina, the following month.MacDonald p. 118 With the cities of Savannah and Augusta taken by February, the campaign was severely weakened. Rutherford moved his troops near Augusta, where he supported General John Ashe during the Battle of Brier Creek on March 3.MacDonald p. 119 Soldiers' enlistments soon began expiring; by April 10 most of Rutherford's forces returned to North Carolina.MacDonald p. 121 The loss of Charleston in 1780 was a huge blow to the Patriot cause and posed a significant threat to neighboring North Carolina, which lacked adequate defenses due to expiring enlistments. Rutherford saw this danger, calling back his remaining troops stationed in South Carolina and ordering all soldiers from Salisbury to rally near Charlotte, North Carolina. A force of 900 had accumulated by early June.Lossing p. 597MacDonald p. 125 =Battle of Ramsour's Mill= After rallying troops at Charlotte, Rutherford received information that Loyalists were gathering at arms at Ramsour's Mill‚Äînear present-day Lincolnton, North Carolina‚Äîand issued orders for local officers to disperse the group before they evolved into an even greater threat. After collecting troops from Rowan and Mecklenburg counties, Rutherford moved his men to the Catawba River and crossed it at the Tuckasegee Ford on June 19. He sent word to Colonel Francis Locke of Rowan County, to rendezvous with him about from Ramsour's Mill, near the forks of the Catawba.Russell p. 154 Locke accumulated a force of 400 men and encamped at Mountain Creek, which was away from Rutherford's position, though still approximately the same distance from Ramsour's Mill as Rutherford's position was. It was resolved by Locke and his officers that a junction with Rutherford was unrealistic given the distance between the two regiments and the limited amount of time before the Loyalist group grew too large to safely engage. Therefore, it was decided Locke's forces would attack the Loyalist's position immediately. Colonel Johnson, one of Locke's subordinates, informed Rutherford of the new situation by 10:00 pm. Locke's forces left their encampment late in the evening of June 19; arriving at the Loyalist position by early morning, June 20. The Patriots took the Loyalists by surprise. While at first bewildered and confused, the Loyalists retaliated by firing at Locke's cavalry, who were forced to fall back. The Patriots eventually forced the Loyalists to retreat to their camp, though it was discovered that they were regrouping on the other side of the mill stream. At this point, since an immediate attack from the Loyalists was expected, messages were sent to Rutherford, who had advanced to within six miles (9.6 km) of Ramsour's, to immediately move forward. Rutherford met Locke within of Ramsour's, where he was informed that the Loyalists were in full retreat. =Battle of Camden= Battle of Camden. Rutherford and other North Carolina militia were positioned in the center of the American formation. The losses at Savannah, Charleston and the Battle of Waxhaws had practically driven the Continental Army from the South, with State defenses reduced to a number of locally-lead partisan militias. In response to the loss of military presence, Congress sent Horatio Gates, who had distinguished himself at Saratoga, to reform the Continental Army in Charlotte, North Carolina.Harrison pp. 107‚Äì108 Against the advice of his officers and without knowing the capabilities of his troops‚Äîsome of which were untested in battle‚ÄîGates marched toward South Carolina on July 27 with over 4,000 men. He aimed to capturing the crossroads town of Camden, South Carolina, which would have been strategically important for control over the South Carolina backcountry. Lord Rawdon, who was stationed there with 1,000 men, alerted Lord Cornwallis of Gates's movements on August 9. Cornwallis arrived at Camden by August 13 with reinforcements, increasing the British presence there to over 2,000 men.Murray p. 50 The battle ensued at dawn on August 16, 1780. Rutherford was positioned in the center of the Continental formation with other North Carolina militia. During the battle, he was wounded and taken prisoner. He was detained for ten months at Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine, Florida, and was later exchanged for another prisoner in 1781.Hunter p. 178MacDonald p. 138 Later war Rutherford returned to Salisbury in September 1781 after his release to find his home ransacked by British troops. After a short reunion with his family, Rutherford trained and took command of 1,400 men of the Salisbury District Brigade and allegedly began to brutally attack Tory militias and communities according to several reports sent to his superior, General Greene.MacDonald pp. 143‚Äì145 Greene disagreed with Rutherford's tactics, warning Rutherford that these methods would only encourage the Loyalist cause.MacDonald pp. 143‚Äì146 While these reports were later found to be false, Rutherford decided to redirect his forces towards the British encampment and surrounding militias at Wilmington, North Carolina, beginning with the Loyalist force at Raft Swamp.MacDonald p. 147 During October and November, Rutherford continued to force the Loyalists into Wilmington, and eventually surrounded the city, successfully cutting off British communications and supply lines. The commanding British officer, Major Craig, was soon afterward informed of Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown, and his forces at Wilmington were hastily evacuated.MacDonald pp. 151‚Äì152 After Wilmington, Rutherford again fought the Chickamauga in the west in 1782. He followed the same route he had taken seven years before. No known accounts were written of the campaign, though it was reportedly successful.MacDonald p. 161 Later life Rutherford was elected to North Carolina's senate during the War in 1779 and continued to serve in this position until 1789. He opposed the restoration of Loyalist lands, supporting and assisting in their confiscation while serving in the Council of State. Rutherford ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1783. He was an ardent anti-federalist during the national debate on the recently created United States Constitution. At a Constitutional Convention held at Hillsborough, North Carolina in 1788, he had reservations about the Constitution‚Äîas did other anti-federalists at the meeting. Rutherford requested if he could challenge some of the clauses.MacDonald p. 168 While each clause was challenged individually despite opposition from federalist Samuel Johnston and others, Rutherford rarely contributed to discussion. His final decision to vote against the ratification of the Constitution resulted in him losing his seat in the state senate. However, his reputation with his colleagues was relatively unaffected, and he was subsequently elected Councilor of the State.MacDonald p. 169 Rutherford acquired nearly 13,000 acres of Washington District land through trading off his 700 acres in Salisbury, government grants and purchasing Continental soldier's tracts.MacDonald p. 176 With his family and eight slaves Rutherford relocated to this area, in what is today Sumner County, Tennessee, in September 1792. Two years later, he was appointed President of the Legislative Council of the Southwest Territory. Rutherford died in Sumner County, Tennessee, on August 10, 1805.Macdonald p. 179 Legacy These areas are all namesakes of Griffith Rutherford: * Rutherfordton, North Carolina * Rutherford County, North Carolina * Rutherford County, Tennessee FootnotesSee also * List of North Carolina militia units in the American Revolution References  * * Category:1721 births Category:1805 deaths Category:18th-century Irish people Category:19th-century Irish people Category:American Revolutionary War prisoners of war held by Great Britain Category:Militia generals in the American Revolution Category:North Carolina militiamen in the American Revolution Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives Category:North Carolina state senators Category:North Carolina sheriffs Category:Members of the Southwest Territorial Legislature Category:Southwest Territory officials Category:American people of Scotch-Irish descent Category:Kingdom of Ireland emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies Category:Members of the North Carolina Provincial Congresses Category:People from Rowan County, North Carolina ","title":"Griffith Rutherford"},{"id":"10142123","text":"Frederick Charles Albert \\"Old Wag\\" Waghorne, Sr. (October 16, 1865 ‚Äì June 19, 1956) was an ice hockey referee and organizer in Canada. He also made significant contributions to lacrosse in that country. He is a member of both the Hockey Hall of Fame and the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in the \\"Builder\\" category.  League organization  Waghorne was born in Tunbridge Wells, England and then moved to Canada. While mainly interested in rugby as a youth, he became interested in lacrosse and ice hockey and eventually started the Toronto Lacrosse Hockey League. This league started out fielding lacrosse teams in the summer and hockey teams in the winter, but as the popularity of hockey grew the league became simply the Toronto Hockey League. When the Toronto Hockey League disbanded, Waghorne continued to work to provide opportunities for hockey players at all levels. In 1911, he formed the Beaches Hockey League which eventually became the Greater Toronto Hockey League, the largest minor league hockey organization in the world.  Officiating  Waghorne is best known for his prolific career as a referee. He is known to have officiated 2,400 hockey games and 1,500 lacrosse matches. Many of the decisions he made on the ice rink became long-term rules in both amateur and professional ice hockey. Waghorne is credited with several changes and innovations to ice hockey rules, such as: * The use of a whistle instead of the customary cow bell to stop play when fans started bringing their own cowbells to disrupt game play. * The acceptance of professional referees in amateur hockey games. * The practice of dropping the puck from a few feet up at faceoff rather than placing it directly on the ice, which limited player contact with the referee's shins and ankles during faceoffs. * The ruling that if a half of a broken hockey puck entered the net, no goal was counted - a rule that led to the development of one-piece pucks.  Honors  Waghorne was involved with ice hockey and lacrosse until his death in 1956 at the age of 90. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961, and to the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1965.

Established on the edge of the narrow, fertile valley known as Wadi Hanifa, Manfuha was until the mid-20th century considered a twin village to the current Saudi capital of Riyadh. According to Yaqut's 13th century geographical encyclopedia Mu'jam Al-Buldan, Manfuha was built a few centuries before Islam at the same time as Hajr (now Riyadh) by members of the Banu Hanifa tribe and their cousins from the tribe of Bakr. Manfuha was home to the famous Arab poet Al-A'sha, who died at around the same time as the Muslim prophet Muhammad, but little is heard of Manfuha after that time. At the turn of the 20th century, its population was made up largely of members of Banu Hanifa and Bakr (who by now had come to identify themselves with the related tribe of 'Anizzah), as well as members of Tamim and Subay'. Like all Nejdi towns, its population also included a large percentage of non-tribally- affiliated tradesmen (sonnaa'), as well as many slaves and freedmen working as agricultural laborers. Like Riyadh, the town was surrounded by gardens and palm groves. In the late 18th century, Manfuha fell under the rule of the energetic ruler of Riyadh, Deham ibn Dawwas, who at the time was vigorously resisting the expansion of the new Wahhabist state established by the Al Saud clan of neighboring Diriyah (see First Saudi State). Both towns eventually succumbed to the Saudis, however, who ruled over Manfuha until their state was destroyed by an Ottoman-Egyptian invasion in 1818. From then on, the town's fortunes largely followed those of its neighbor, Riyadh, returning to Saudi rule under Turki ibn Abdallah in 1824, then falling under the rule of the Al Rashid clan of Ha'il in the 1890s, before reverting to Saudi rule less than ten years later under the founder of Saudi Arabia, Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud. As the neighboring Saudi capital expanded exponentially in the 20th century, fueled by the country's oil wealth, the walls of both Manfuha and Riyadh were torn down, and Manfuha was quickly swallowed in whole by the growing metropolis. Today, Manfuha is among the poorer districts of Riyadh. Most of its original inhabitants have left to newer districts of the capital, and the area is now mostly inhabited by low-income guest-workers from Egypt and South Asia, as well as the families of former African slaves. Some of the town's old mud- brick buildings remain, as well as an ancient observation tower. A wide avenue cuts through the center of Manfuha, named Al-A'sha Street, after its most famous son.

The prison opened in 1879 and became infamous for the high levels of violence that took place inside its walls. The state, under Governor Martin O'Malley, closed the prison in March 2007.Helderman, Rosalind S. \\"In Surprise Move, Md. Closes Jessup Prison, Transfers Inmates.\\" Washington Post. Monday March 19, 2007. Retrieved on January 1, 2010. The prison was situated on south of Maryland Route 175 between U.S. 1 and the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway. Most of its territory was in Anne Arundel County, while portions were in Howard County. History The facility was built on land near the former Spurrier's Tavern and a hand-dug section of the B&O; railroad called \\"Jessop's Cut\\". In 1897, the Baltimore Sun editor petitioned for prison workers to perform road labor to relieve pressure on the overcrowded facility. The nickname \\"The Cut\\" was often used during HBO's series The Wire, and during the show's second season many scenes were set at Jessup. The Maryland House of Correction had a long history of harsh living conditions for inmates and dangerous conditions for correctional officers. Large prison riots occurred in 1945, 1964 and 1972. The prison was replaced in 2003 by North Branch Correctional Institution, a supermax prison in Cumberland, Maryland, with far greater control features and security. Demolition of the former prison began in January 2014.

Since the realm deputation main conclusion of 1803, Pinzberg belongs to Bavaria. In the course of the administrative reforms in Bavaria, today's municipality developed with the municipality edict of 1818. Population Population in the municipality in 1970 was 1,608, in 1987 was 1,696, and in the year 2000, 1,864 inhabitants were counted. Politics Since 1996, there is a youth local council in Pinzberg. This was brought into being by the mayor at that time, Reinhardt Glauber. The current youth mayor (in German \\"Jugendbuergermeister\\") is Fabian Fridl. The local council of Pinzberg has 13 members including the mayor. Coat of arms The coat of arms reads: In gold an in-curved red point, therein a silver gate tower also on both sides following silver right parallelepiped wall; beseitet in front of a black three-blade clover sheet, in the back of a black grain flower bloom. Pinzberg consists of the municipalities Dobenreuth, Elsenberg, Gosberg and Pinzberg. All places are to be represented in the coat of arms. The tower is the landmark of Pinzberg and refers to the church tower, that at the same time serves as a gate tower of the cemetery attachment from the second half of 15th Century. The in-curved red point is the symbol of the Holy Trinity and stands for Gosberg and its branch church, which the Holy Trinity is dedicated. The clover sheet stands for Dobenreuth and symbolizes the rare Patrozinium of the holy family. Since the Middle Ages both the terrestrial and the Holy Trinity are often represented by nature forms such as clover sheets. The agriculture of Elsenberg is represented by the cornflower sheet on the coat of arms. The colors gold and black from the Pinzberg coat of arms remind of the long-lasting relationship with the diocese Bamberg. In the year 1062 Heinrich IV gave parts of today's territory of Pinzberg the diocese. The emblem is used since 1988 on the legal base of a Resolution of the local council and the agreement of the government of Upper Franconia.

The base was officially constituted on 31 December 2000, and since then has been the home base for the 3rd Tactical Squadron. It is the first base to host the recently acquired F-16 fighters. History In 1941, during its occupation of Pozna≈Ñ, Nazi Germany built an aircraft factory at Krzesiny (German: Luftwaffenfliegerhorst Kreising), along with an airfield to service it. The factory, run by Focke-Wulf, was a target for Allied bombers in the course of the war, on 29 May 1944 for Eighth Air Force. On 22 January 1945 the airfield was captured by Red Army and taken over by the Soviet Air Force, which in turn passed it to the Polish military in 1954, which has used it since, hosting various units under changing designations: *since 1954: one of squadrons of 11th Fighter Regiment (11. Pu≈Çk Lotnictwa My≈õliwskiego) that was in this same year transformed to 62nd School- Training Fighter Regiment (62. Pu≈Çk Szkolno-Treningowy Lotnictwa My≈õliwskiego) which was part of 3rd Air Defence Corps (3. Korpus Obrony Powietrznej) *in 1957 regiment was renamed to 62nd Fighter Regiment (62. Pu≈Çk Lotnictwa My≈õliwskiego) which, in 1958, received name of \\"Insurgents of Greater Poland Uprising (1918‚Äì1919)\\" (Powsta≈Ñc√≥w Wielkopolskich 1918/1919) *on 16 January 1994 regiment was renamed to 3rd Fighter Regiment of Pozna≈Ñ (3. Pu≈Çk Lotnictwa My≈õliwskiego \\"Pozna≈Ñ\\") that consists two squadrons *in 1999 1st squadron was enlarged by part of personnel and aircraft of disbanded 17th Air Force Squadron (17. Eskadra Lotnicza) from Pozna≈Ñ-≈Åawica Airport The organisation as an air base was implemented on 31 December 2000 to conform with NATO practices, separating the air base from the units which are based there. On this date 3rd Fighter Regiment was split into 31st Air Base (31. Baza Lotnicza) and 3rd Tactical Squadron (3. Eskadra Lotnictwa Taktycznego). On 1 April 2008 31st Air Base was again joined with 3rd Tactical Squadron and 6th Tactical Squadron to form single unit named 31st Tactical Air Base. Confusion with Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica Airport Pozna≈Ñ‚ÄìKrzesiny Airport has been confused by pilots with Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica Airport, which also has a runway. The runways are at approximately the same orientation: ≈Åawica's is 11/29 (true heading: 108/288) and Krzesiny's is 12/30 (true heading: 117.9/297.9). The two runways lie in a nearly straight line, with Krzesiny coming up first on approaches from the east, the ones used most often. On the other hand, the Krzesiny airbase lies southeast from the city centre, while Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica lies just west of it. Krzesiny had a second runway, but at an unknown date this second runway that crosses runway 12/30 was closed, as in satellite images it is marked with large white X marks. One notable incident involving confusion between ≈Åawica and Krzesiny happened on August 15, 2006. What happened was that a Sky Airlines aircraft ‚Äì a Boeing 737-800 that operated the flight SKY335 ‚Äì mistook the runway at Krzesiny for the one being used in ≈Åawica. The crew didn't realise their error until later, when they took off to reposition the jet to the main airport. According to Krzysztof Krawcewicz, a pilot and the editor-in-chief of the Polish monthly PrzeglƒÖd Lotniczy/Aviation Revue, this was at least the seventh mistaken aircraft that landed at the Pozna≈Ñ‚ÄìKrzesiny airfield in 2006 alone. He faults, among others, the \\"scandalous procedures which are in use by the air traffic control at Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica\\" and the lack of radar use in controlling aircraft landing, which exists, but has been turned off by the Polish Air Traffic Agency (Agencja Ruchu Lotniczego).

It was the last film Will Hay made with his most famous comic foils, Moore Marriott and Graham Moffatt. Synopsis Will Hay plays the incompetent Fire Captain Viking who fails to find a large fire, gets lost in the process and ends up on a newspaper headline as 'The engine that never made it'. Finally upon arriving at the location of the fire (discovering it's been put out) he hears that his local town hall is on fire. After failing to appear before the town hall burns down, Fire Captain Viking is told to put out a fire successfully or else he and his men face the sack. Viking and his crew, Albert and Harbottle, proceed to London to gain more experience of an efficient fire station, with Albert and Harbottle \\"knocking-off\\" several items. Shortly after embarking on a series of dangerous exploits to improve the efficiency of his fire department including automated turn out equipment and destroying public property with a fireman's pole, Captain Viking accidentally creates a new form of firefighting foam that he wishes to demonstrate in London, the London fire department begins to assess the formula for the foam and intends to get in touch with them shortly after. Meanwhile a group of criminals having seen Vikings fire engine in the newspaper wish to hire it for what Viking and his crew believe to be a film, Viking initially refuses but promises they can borrow the engine after his foam has been demonstrated in London, (Also after the criminals offer a ¬£30 bribe to him and his crew). The criminals intent then being revealed to be the theft of the Crown jewels from the Tower of London as Vikings engine is almost identical to the Tower fire engine. Harbottle becomes impatient waiting for his money and decides to start a large fire at a Petrol Station to allow the foam to be demonstrated and for the news to reach London, with Albert reminding them if they fail to put out this fire they will be sacked. After failing to turn out for nearly half-an-hour thanks to Vikings automated turn out equipment they arrive at the fire, after a series of problems with hoses they start spraying the blaze only to discover that their hose is hooked up to a petrol pump, the result being the entire petrol station burning to the ground. Now facing the sack Viking and his crew enjoy a brief reprieve when the Mayors house catches fire, however upon returning to their fire station they discover their engine and horse are both missing, the engine having been stolen by the criminals and their horse simply following it. Realizing they will now be sacked they hear that their horse has been found in the London borough of Wapping, whilst packing Viking finds a letter from the London fire brigade wishing him and his crew to demonstrate their firefighting foam in London the next day. Viking and his crew now proceed to London to recover their engine full of foam.

It was followed by a 2009 reboot entitled Jingles the Clown. Plot Young Angie Randall witnesses a spree killing clown named Mr. Jingles murder her parents, before he is shot to death by Officers Baines and Guinness. Before dying, Jingles tells Angie, \\"I'll be back for you!\\" The traumatized Angie is institutionalized until she is a teenager, at which point she is released into the care of her aunt Helen Jameson, and cousins Dylan and Heidi. At the local cemetery, a visitor is killed by someone dressed as Jingles. Baines (who is now mayor) and Guinness are called to the graveyard by the man who found the body. The stranger tells them this is just the beginning, and reveals he knows that Baines and the police force (excluding Guinness) covered up the fact that Jingles was wrongly lynched and imprisoned when Angie's father and several others thought he tried to abduct Angie at her 4th birthday party, when in reality he had saved her from an actual child predator. After the three men leave, two of Dylan's delinquent friends are slain by Jingles while trying to steal his tombstone for a prank that they, Guinness' daughter Melanie, and a reluctant Dylan intend to play on Angie at a birthday party Heidi is setting up for her. In his home, the stranger tells Guinness that he believes it is not a copycat, that Jingles has actually come back from the dead. The stranger (who reveals he was once employed at the penitentiary where Jingles was placed and witnessed the tortures inflicted on Jingles that drove him mad) presents occult objects that he found in Jingles' prison cell as evidence, prompting Guinness to remember that Jingles did chant something in a strange language as he lay dying. The two grab the items necessary to banish Jingles, who confronts them as they go to leave, killing the stranger, and wounding Guinness. While Angie, Heidi, and Heidi's friends are partying in the Jameson house, Melanie dresses up like Jingles with the intent of crashing the celebration, only to be axed by the real Jingles. Jingles breaks in and kills Heidi, Dylan, and the rest of the revelers, leaving only Angie. An unknown amount of time later, Baines and two police officers enter the house, and find an hysterical Angie clutching Jingles' axes, making it appear as if she is the murderer. As she is being hauled away by a police officer, Angie is saved by Guinness, while Jingles attacks Baines and another officer.

Also known as the Evelyn Hazen House or the Joseph Alexander Mabry Jr. House, when constructed in 1858 for Joseph Alexander Mabry II it was named Pine Hill Cottage. The house was in what was then the separate town of East Knoxville. Stylistically, the house exhibits both Italianate and Greek Revival elements. Additions in 1886 increased the size of the first floor. Having operated as a museum since the death of Evelyn Hazen, the house retains its original furniture and family collections, including antique china and crystal with over 2,000 original artifacts on display making it the largest original family collection within America. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At the outset of the American Civil War, Joseph Mabry II, a wealthy Knoxville merchant and importer, pledged $100,000.00 to outfit an entire regiment of Confederate soldiers. Because of this assistance to the cause, he was given the honorary title of General in the Confederate army. During the course of the war, both Union and Confederate forces occupied the strategic site of his house adjacent to Fort Hill. Confederate General Felix Zollicoffer set up his headquarters in the house in 1861, but it was Union forces who had the greatest impact when they fortified the grounds as part of their Knoxville defenses after later taking control of Knoxville. After Mabry's death in 1882, his daughter Alice Evelyn Mabry and her husband Rush Strong Hazen resided in the house.Mabry‚ÄìHazen House, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture Their youngest daughter, Evelyn Hazen, later occupied the house alone (except for many pet dogs and cats) for many years until her death in 1987. Her will stipulated that the house had either to become a museum or be razed to the ground. The house opened as a museum in 1992.Amy McCrary, Mabry‚ÄìHazen tells intriguing tales back to 1850s, Knoxville News Sentinel, January 22, 2006  Cemetery  Knoxville's Confederate Cemetery, also known as Bethel Cemetery, located at 1917 Bethel Avenue, occupies near the house, and is owned by the same museum foundation. It contains the graves of approximately 1,600 Confederate soldiers, 50‚Äì60 Union men (prisoners) and 20 veterans. The cemetery also contains a high monument erected in 1892, consisting of a Tennessee marble obelisk topped by a Confederate soldier facing north. The cemetery property includes a frame caretaker's house, built circa 1881, known as the Winstead Mansion.  In literature  Three generations of the occupants of the Mabry‚ÄìHazen House have been referenced in literary works. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain wrote about the gunfight that killed the home's builder Joseph Mabry II, and his son, Joseph III (known as Joseph Jr.). Mabry's daughter married Rush Strong Hazen, a benefactor to Leonora Whitaker Wood, whose life was fictionalized in the novel, Christy. In 2007, author Jane Van Ryan published The Seduction of Miss Evelyn Hazen, a book chronicling the sensational lawsuit between Knoxville socialite Evelyn Hazen, granddaughter of General Mabry, and Ralph Scharringhaus, to whom she was once engaged.

He made his Preston North End debut as an 18-year-old on Boxing Day 1979 in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Shrewsbury Town. Quickly establishing himself as a tough-tackling attacking full back, McAteer didn't miss a game for the rest of the season, becoming a firm favourite with the Deepdale fans. The following season, he struggled with injury but still made 26 appearances as the club were relegated to Division Three. These were hard times for Preston, as they constantly struggled against relegation and financial ruin. McAteer, however, was a mainstay in the team making 277 appearances scoring nine goals during his first spell there. Blackpool In December 1986 John McGrath accepted a bid of ¬£17,000 from local rivals Blackpool. McAteer played for the Seasiders for eighteen months. In June 1988 he was given a free transfer, mainly due to injuries. He made 47 appearances without scoring. Return to Preston John McGrath offered McAteer a return to Preston, in the form of a two-year deal. Injury, however, restricted him initially. On returning to fitness, a game in the reserves resulted in an over-zealous YTS opposition player coming in too hard and breaking McAteer's tibia and fibula. He subsequently had to retire from the professional game at the age of 28. In total he had played 343 games, scoring 10 goals.

The history of rail transport in Japan began in the late Edo period. There have been four main stages:Wakuda Aoki, et al., A History of Japanese Railways 1872‚Äì1999 (2000) # Stage 1, from 1872, the first line, from Tokyo to Yokohama, to the end of the Russo-Japanese war; # Stage 2, from nationalization in 1906-07 to the end of World War II; # Stage 3, from the postwar creation of Japanese National Railways to 1987; # Stage 4, from privatization to the present, with JNR split between six new railway operators for passengers and one for freight. Stage 1: early development, 1872‚Äì1906 The development of the Japanese railway network commenced shortly after the country opened its borders to formal international contact after a shogunate-imposed isolation of about 250 years, and was initiated (along with many other changes to Japanese society at the time) so that Japan could achieve rapid modernization.Ericson, S. The Sound of the Whistle: Railroads and the State in Meiji Japan (19Harvard East Asia Monographs Though rail transport had been known through limited foreign contact such as with Dutch traders in Dejima, Nagasaki, the impact of model railroads brought by foreigners such as Yevfimiy Putyatin and Matthew Calbraith Perry was huge. The British also demonstrated a steam locomotive in Nagasaki. Saga Domain, a Japanese feudal domain (han), made a working model and planned to construct a line. Bodies such as the Satsuma Domain and the Tokugawa shogunate reviewed railway construction from Edo to Kyoto via an inland route, but a line did not come to reality before the Meiji Restoration. Whilst the Emperor of Japan, based in Kyoto, was the titular ruler of the country, since circa 1600 Japan had been effectively ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate, based in Edo. In 1866 the shogunate proposed a railway from Edo to Kyoto via an inland route, but in 1868 the Meiji Restoration saw the Emperor returned as effective leader of the country, relocating his permanent residence to the renamed Tokyo (\\"Eastern Capital\\"). Just before the fall of the shogunate, the Tokugawa regime issued a grant to the American diplomat Anton L. C. Portman to construct a line from Yokohama to Edo (soon to be renamed Tokyo), but this grant was not continued by the new regime.Free, Early Japanese Railways 1853‚Äì1914: Engineering Triumphs That Transformed Meiji-era Japan, (Tuttle Publishing, 2008) () No. 1, one of the earliest locomotives later type 150, was UK made In 1868 Thomas Blake Glover, a Scottish merchant, was responsible for bringing the first steam locomotive, \\"Iron Duke\\", to Japan, which he demonstrated on an 8-mile track in the ≈åura district of Nagasaki. However, after ~250 years of a culture of ‚Äòdistrust of foreigners‚Äô, construction of the ‚Äòpremier‚Äô railway connecting Japan‚Äôs former and new capitals by non-Japanese was considered politically unacceptable to the new Japanese regime, and so the government of Japan decided to build a railway from the major port of Yokohama to Tokyo using British financing and 300 British and European technical advisors: civil engineers, general managers, locomotive builders and drivers.Free, (2008) In order to undertake its construction, foreign experts were contracted, with the specific intent that such experts would educate Japanese co-workers so that Japan could become self-sufficient in railway construction expertise, at which time the foreign contractors were expected to leave the country. On September 12, 1872, the first railway, between Shimbashi (later Shiodome) and Yokohama (present Sakuragich≈ç) opened. (The date is in Tenp≈ç calendar, October 14 in present Gregorian calendar). A one-way trip took 53 minutes in comparison to 40 minutes for a modern electric train. Service started with nine round trips daily.Naotaka Hirota Steam Locomotives of Japan (1972) Kodansha International Ltd. pp.22-25,34-38,44-46&52-54 British engineer Edmund Morel (1841-1871) supervised construction of the first railway on Honshu during the last year of his life, American engineer Joseph U. Crowford (1842-1942) supervised construction of a coal mine railway on Hokkaid≈ç in 1880, and German engineer Herrmann Rumschottel (1844-1918) supervised railway construction on Kyushu beginning in 1887. All three trained Japanese engineers to undertake railway projects. Two men trained by Crowford later became presidents of Japan National Railways. A bronze bust of Morel in , a bronze statue of Crowford in the Temiya Railway Memorial Museum, and a bust of Rumschottel in commemorate their contributions to Japan's railways. The precise reason why a track gauge of (also known as \\"Cape gauge\\") came to be selected remains uncertain. It could be because was supposed to be cheaper to build than the internationally more widely used \\"Stephenson gauge\\" of , or because the first British agent, whose contract was later cancelled, ordered iron sleepers made for the narrower gauge. It seems most likely, however, that Morel's previous experience building Cape gauge railways in similar New Zealand terrain was a significant influence, and Cape gauge became the de facto standard. Network expansion The next line constructed was from another port, Kobe, to the major commercial city of Osaka (opening in 1874), and then to Kyoto (1877) and Otsu (1880) at the southern end of Lake Biwa. A line was constructed from Tsuruga, on the Sea of Japan, to Ogaki (connecting to a canal to Nagoya) via Nagahama on the northern end of Lake Biwa, opening in 1884 and utilizing trans-shipment onto water-going vessels to connect the Sea of Japan to Osaka, Kyoto and Nagoya. Linking Tokyo to Nagoya and Kyoto became the next priority. Initially the proposed route was inland, from Tokyo north to Takasaki, then west through the Usui Pass to Karuizawa and the Kiso River valley. At this time the Nippon Railway Co. (NRC) became the first to be granted a concession to operate what became the Tohoku Main Line from Ueno to Aomori, with a branch line from Omiya to Takasaki. Construction of both lines was undertaken by the Government at the company‚Äôs expense, with the government having running rights on the Takasaki-Ueno section. The line to Takasaki opened in 1884, as did the Tohoku line as far as Utsunomiya. The NRC also financed a new line linking to the Yokohama line which was built from Akabane via Shinjuku to Shinagawa (with the NRC gaining track usage rights at the government station at Shinagawa). This was the first section of what has become the Yamanote Line, and opened in 1885. The government funded line from Takasaki reached Yokokawa at the base of the Usui Pass in 1885, and initial surveys indicated a ruling grade of 10% (later improved to 6.67%) and extensive tunneling was required to reach Karuizawa. Construction also started on another line from the Sea of Japan, commencing at Naoetsu and opening to Karuizawa via Nagano in 1888. As the costs of construction through the mountainous interior of Japan became apparent, in 1886 the construction of what became the Tokaido line was approved, approximately paralleling the southern coastline (and Tokaido road) as far as Nagoya. Although ~238 km longer, it was projected to cost 13% less, this saving then being allocated to construct a line from Otsu along the eastern side of Lake Biwa to Nagahama to remove the need for trans-shipment, which opened in 1889, as did the final section of the Tokaido Line via Gotemba. Until the opening of the Tokaido Shinkansen in 1964, this was the most important main line in Japan. In the meantime the Tohoku line reached Sendai in 1887 and Aomori in 1891. Consolidating the network In 1888 the San'y≈ç Railway Co. (SRC) was granted a charter to build the San'y≈ç Main Line from Kobe west to Shimonoseki, a port providing a connection to the port of Moji on Kyushu, from which the Kyushu Railway Co (KRC) built its line to Hakata and Kumamoto opening between 1889 and 1891, extended to Yatsushiro in 1896. The SRC line reached Hiroshima in 1894, and Shimonoseki in 1901. Other private endeavors included the Mito Railway, which opened the first section of the Joban Line in 1889 and was acquired by the NRC in 1892 which extended to Sendai via an east coastal route in 1905 and the Bantan Railway, which built a 52km line north from Himeji between 1894 and 1901, and was acquired by the SRC in 1903. The success of the Nippon Railway Co and other private companies led to a Japanese situation akin to the UK Railway Mania. From the mid 1880s until 1891 new railway companies had little difficulty in attracting funding, usually through issuing shares. However, in 1891 the failure of a company proposing to build a line from Gotenba to Matsumoto ended the ‚Äòmania‚Äô, and the Government realized a more planned approach to the network expansion it desired was required. Evolving policy In 1887 the Japanese Army proposed building its own lines to ensure routes of military significance were given priority. The Railway Department deflected that proposal by commencing development of a policy for a comprehensive national network. The Japanese Government became increasingly interested in the policy formulation following the completion of the Tokaido Main Line in 1889, the creation of the National Diet in 1890 and the financial panic of 1891. 1891 also saw construction start on the Usui Pass section, the ~11 km section to Karuizawa requiring 26 tunnels, 18 viaducts and to be worked using the Abt rack railway system to cope with the 6.67% ruling grade. The line opened in 1893, linking Naoetsu and Nagano to Tokyo. In 1892 the Railway Construction Act (RCA) listed a series of priority routes on Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku (Hokkaido was covered separately in 1896 legislation), with the specific policy that private construction of such routes would be encouraged, with the Japanese Government only funding routes not able to be privately constructed. By that year the privately owned network was ~2,124km compared to the government owned sections totaling ~887 km. While this figure seemed to indicate the potential for further private funding of railway construction (notwithstanding the routes already targeted by private companies), subsequent events demonstrated otherwise. A two-phase approach was adopted in the RCA, with 40 routes totaling ~3,000 km included in the \\"phase one\\" 12-year program, with phase 2 covering another ~4,000 km of proposed lines, the priorities being set on the basis of economic development and/or military strategic importance. A specific outcome of the RCA was that every prefecture would be served by railway communication. The major routes proposed under the act for government construction included; * The Chuo line, an inland connection from Tokyo to Nagoya favored by the military (detailed below); * The Ou line, also detailed below; * Extension of the line from Tsuruga to Kanazawa and Toyama (Hokuriku Main Line) opened 1896-1899; * A connection from the Chuo line at Shiojiri to Matsuyama and Nagano (Shinonoi Line) opened 1900-1902; and * The original inland line from Kagoshima to Yatsushiro (now the Nippo Main Line and Hisatsu Line) opened 1901-1909 The Chuo line, the route of which approximated the initial proposed inland line between Tokyo and Nagoya, was favored by the military as its inland alignment protected it from perceived risk of bombardment by enemy vessels. A privately built line from Shinjuku to the silk industry centre of Hachioji had opened 1889, and this became the starting point for government construction. The newly determined route was via Kofu (through the 4,657 m Sasago tunnel, which was the longest in Japan until the Shimizu Tunnel opened in 1931), Shiojiri and then via the Kiso River valley to Nagoya. Construction was undertaken from both ends, with sections opening sequentially from 1900 until the lines were connected in 1911. The Ou line from Fukushima to Yamagata, Akita and Aomori, serving the poorer northern Sea of Japan coastal prefectures, was seen as a priority for national development that was commercially unattractive. The government commenced construction from Aomori towards Hirosaki in 1894, and at the southern end from Fukushima in 1899, the lines connecting in 1905. Tellingly, most of the major routes proposed under the act for private construction were not so funded and were ultimately constructed by the government, including; * Oita ‚Äì Miyazaki, opened 1911‚Äì1923 as part of the Nippo Main Line; * Takamatsu ‚Äì Kochi ‚Äì Yawatahama (a 44km section was built privately in 1889-1897, the remaining ~300km route opened 1914-1951 as parts of the Yosan Line, Dosan Line and Yodo Line); * Okayama ‚Äì Yonago, opened 1919‚Äì1928 as the Hakubi Line; * Shinjo ‚Äì Sakata, opened 1913‚Äì1914 as the Rikuu West Line; * Morioka ‚Äì Omagari, partially opened as a light railway in 1921, upgraded and completed in 1966 as the Tazawako Line and now part of the Akita Shinkansen line. A few of the lines that were privately funded included Tsubata ‚Äì Nanao, opened 1898 as the Nanao Line, and the Kabe Line from Hiroshima, opened 1909‚Äì1911 as a 2'6\\" gauge light railway, the proposed destination of Hamada on the Sea of Japan coast never being reached. In contrast, the major naval port of Kure was proposed to be served by a government line from Hiroshima, opened as a private line in 1903 only to be nationalized in 1906. The development and in particular the financing of the railway network featured an ongoing debate about the merits of private vs public railway ownership, with an example of this situation being the Horonai Railway on Hokkaido, which was constructed using public funds in 1880, privatized in 1889 and re-nationlised in 1906. Construction continued on routes already secured by private companies, including a direct Osaka ‚Äì Nagoya line opened in 1898 by the Kansai Railway Co. Railway policy development had evolved rapidly as the learnings about, and benefits of the railway became apparent, and as the Japanese government realized it could not afford to finance all the railway construction desired. However, even as it facilitated private railway development, some government representatives advocated for all railways to be nationally owned. Given the Japanese government could not fund all construction on the main island of Honshu, let alone the rest of Japan, it is no surprise the construction of the initial lines on Hokkaido, Shikoku and Kyushu were undertaken by the Prefectural government and private companies respectively, and then the Hokkaido line was sold to a private operator in 1889, though the government built the line from Hakodate to Otaru in 1903-04, which connected to the private line to Sapporo. By 1905, ~80% of the Japanese railway network was privately owned, and included joint operations such as an overnight sleeper train from Tokyo to Shimonoseki, changing from JGR to SRC operation at Kobe. Politicians such as Inoue Masaru stated all the railway lines should be nationalized. However, the government was financially strained after the Satsuma Rebellion, making the expansion of the network terribly slow. Politicians then wanted to allow private companies to build railways. Consequently, Nippon Railway was founded as a private entity, strongly effecting the government's projects. It expanded railways fairly quickly, completing the main line between Ueno and Aomori (present T≈çhoku Main Line) in 1891. With the success of Nippon Railway, private companies were also founded. San'y≈ç Railway, Ky≈´sh≈´ Railway, Hokkaid≈ç Colliery and Railway, Kansai Railway and Nippon Railway were called the \\"major five private railways\\" at the time. At the same time, the national railway opened lines, including the current T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line in 1889, but most of its lines were subsidiary to major private lines. In 1892, the Imperial Diet promulgated the Railway Construction Act, which listed 33 railway routes that should be constructed by either the government or private entities. Railways were introduced to provide both inter-city and intra-city transport. The first horsecar line in Japan was built in Tokyo in 1882. The first tram was the , which opened in 1895. Some operators began to use EMUs rather than locomotives for inter-city transport. Many such railway companies, modelled after interurbans in the United States, are the origins of the current private railway operators.

South Manchuria Railway The military expressed concern about the delays in troop movements that occurred during the 1904‚Äì05 Russo-Japanese War, and attributed such delays to the mix of private and government railway ownership. Whether reasonable or not, the attribution tipped the balance in favour of nationalization of the major railway companies, and in 1906 the Government proposed to nationalize 42 railway companies, though ultimately 17 companies were involved, including the \\"Big 5\\" companies (Nippon, San'y≈ç, Kyushu and Kansai Railway companies and the Hokkaido Coal & Railway Co), and covering virtually all main intercity/regional routes. The major shareholders of the railway companies being nationalized welcomed the move, for differing reasons. In the case of the \\"Big 5\\" companies, dividend payments had predominated over capital expenditure on maintenance and improvements, and such deferred expenditure was a looming liability had nationalization not occurred. In the case of smaller companies which had not been as profitable as the \\"Big 5\\", the market for Government bonds (which were used to pay for the nationalization) was usually better than for shares in the smaller railways, as well as providing at least the same, if not a better rate of return. The legislation authorizing the nationalization also provided for the continuation of private railways (and creation of new companies) providing local (ie. non main line) rail transport. However, as most such lines would be less (or un)profitable branch lines, the 1910 Light Railways Act was required to authorize construction of lower cost lines, including 2'6\\" gauge lines, in order to enable provision of railways to smaller and/or more remote communities. Some of the resulting lines initially constructed to 2'6\\" gauge were later regauged to 3'6\\" where there was economic justification to do so. Pre-war development Locomotives for the early railways were usually built in the country of the designing engineer. The first railways on Honshu used locomotives built in the United Kingdom. Locomotives from the United States arrived in Hokkaid≈ç in 1888 and from Germany arrived in Kyushu in 1889. Early British locomotives were often tank locomotives, while the earliest American locomotives were 2-6-0 and 4-4-0 types with tenders. German manufacturers produced a number of smaller tank locomotives including some for narrow gauge. Richard Trevithick's grandson Francis Henry Trevithick became locomotive superintendent for JNR in the late 19th century, and ordered locomotives from the United Kingdom including numerous 4-4-0 types. His brother Richard Francis Trevithick designed the first locomotive to be manufactured in Japan in 1893. Japanese manufacturers initially depended heavily on imported locomotive parts. JNR ceased importing locomotives in 1912. Thereafter, with the exception of a few experimental locomotives manufactured by Orenstein & Koppel or American Locomotive Company, production locomotives were JNR designs built by Japanese manufacturers. Private railway companies were the major players in the early stages. However, after the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo- Japanese War, the government planned to directly control the unified railway network for strategic purposes. In 1906 the Railway Nationalization Act was promulgated, nationalizing many trunk railway lines. From this time, the nationalized railway became the major Japanese network. However, having used its money for nationalizing, the government did not have enough money to expand the network to the countryside. It passed the Light Railway Act, encouraging smaller private operators to build . Larger private railway operators developed their businesses, modeled on interurbans. Hanshin Express Electric Railway (the current Hankyu Railway) built its own department store connected to its terminus; the management model is still used. Unlike interurban operators in United States, which suffered from motorization as early as the 1910s, Japanese counterparts did not experience the phenomenon until the 1960s, giving them stable development and allowing their survival.

Groundbreaking ceremony of Ginza Line, the oldest subway line in Asia, 1925. The first subway in Asia (the current Tokyo Metro Ginza Line) opened in 1927. The first trolleybus appeared in 1928. In the territories of the Japanese Empire at the time, railways in Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin were built by the Japanese. In Manchukuo, a nation in Northeast China virtually controlled by Japanese, South Manchuria Railway operated its railway network. One of achievements in this period in railway technology was the conversion of link and pin couplers of locomotives and cars to automatic couplers in July 1925 in Honsh≈´ and Ky≈´sh≈´ after considerable preparation. ÈâÑÈÅìÂçöÁâ©È§® Â±ïÁ§∫Ë≥áÊñôÁ¥π‰ªã [Ëá™ÂãïÈÄ£ÁµêÂô®] On April 1, 1930, the Ministry of Railways adopted the metric system, replacing Imperial units, for the measuring of railways. *1895 ‚Äì Acquisition of railway in Taiwan *1899 ‚Äì Opening of Keijin Railway, first railway in Korea *1906 ‚Äì Opening of first railway in Karafuto *1906 ‚Äì Foundation of South Manchuria Railway *1906‚Äì1907 ‚Äì Nationalization of 17 private railways *1910 ‚Äì Light Railway Act * 1914 ‚Äì Opening of Tokyo Station *1925 ‚Äì Introduction of automatic couplers to national network * 1925 ‚Äì Inauguration of the Yamanote Loop Line * 1927 ‚Äì Opening of Tokyo subway, the first subway in the East *1930 ‚Äì Adoption of metric system Wartime situation Hiroshima streetcar No.651 destroyed by A-bomb. This car was repaired and was used after the war. After the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War (World War II), the railways came under military control. In 1938, the government decided to unify private railways into regional blocks, making larger companies such as Tokyo Kyuko Electric Railway (called Great T≈çky≈´ in comparison with postwar T≈çky≈´) and Kinki Nippon Railway. In this period there was a second wave of nationalization. Twenty-two railway companies were forcibly acquired by the government in 1943 and 1944. Unlike the first wave in 1906‚Äì1907, which integrated trunk lines into government control, this wave mainly targeted railways with industrial value. The acquired lines include the Tsurumi Line, the Hanwa Line and the Iida Line. On October 11, 1942, the Ministry of Railways adopted the 24-hour clock following the use in the military. From 1943, the national railway reduced its civilian passenger service, giving priority to military transport. In 1944, it abolished all the limited express trains, first-class cars, dining cars, and sleeping cars. Under the , some railway operators were forced to remove one track from double track lines and others were forced to discontinue their business in order to satisfy the military demand for steel.:ja:‰∏çË¶Å‰∏çÊÄ•Á∑ö lists the lines. On January 29, 1940, a train fire at Ajikawaguchi Station on the Nishinari Line resulted in 189 deaths. This is the deadliest rail accident in Japan if excluding the explosion of military train of the Okinawa Prefectural Railways on December 11, 1944 that resulted in about 220 deaths. The war, especially strategic bombings by United States, damaged the railways heavily. The worst case was in Okinawa, which lost its railways until the opening of Okinawa Urban Monorail in 2003. In most cases, railways resumed operations fairly quickly. Some lines of the national railway resumed after the day of Tokyo bombing. San'y≈ç Main Line resumed two days after the atomic bombing in Hiroshima, while Hiroshima Electric Railway resumed three days after. *1942 ‚Äì Adoption of 24-hour clock *1942 ‚Äì Opening of Kanmon Tunnel connecting Honsh≈´ and Ky≈´sh≈´ *1945 ‚Äì End of World War II; railways were severely damaged Stage 3, 1945‚Äì1987: Post-war recovery and development Kodama, debuted in 1958, was the first EMU limited express train by JNR, linking Tokyo and Osaka. 101 series EMU, an innovative commuter train, debuted in 1957. T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen made its first service in 1964. It took several more years for the railways to fully recover. After the defeat, the lack of materials caused facilities to not be properly maintained. The lack of materials necessitated people buying in wholesale resulting in a rapid increase in passengers. Train services were further reduced due to the lack of coal. Overcrowded trains resulted in numerous accidents. Transport related to U.S. General HQ (GHQ) was given first priority, with many \\"Allies Personnel Only\\" trains. In 1949, under the directive of the GHQ, Japanese Government Railways, which had been directly operated by the Ministry of Transport, was reorganized as Japanese National Railways (JNR), a state-owned public corporation. Beginning in the 1950s, the electrification of trunk lines began to progress. Electrification of T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line was completed in 1956, the San'y≈ç Main Line in 1964, and the T≈çhoku Main Line in 1968. In 1954, the government decided to abolish steam haulage, and most were decommissioned by 1976. Many trains were converted from locomotive-hauled services to electric or diesel multiple units. The , such as 101 series EMU developed in 1957, symbolize the phenomenon. The 1960s saw great improvement in the economy, including the railways. The T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen, the first modern high-speed rail line, opened in 1964. Many limited express trains and overnight trains started to cross the nation, marking the golden age of railways. However, Japan finally began to experience motorization, and tram networks in cities were treated as obstacles to vehicles. They quickly disappeared, partly replaced by rapidly built subway networks. The first monorail, the Ueno Zoo Monorail, opened in 1957. With the expanding economy, the number of commuters using railways rapidly increased, especially in the Greater Tokyo Area. JNR tried to increase its capacity by the to redevelop major five lines in the area by making them quadruple track. This improved passenger flow through the network tremendously. The cost of the campaign and the construction of Shinkansen and other lines further increased debt. Confrontation between the unions and management was serious, resulting in many strikes. To resolve the situation, JNR was privatized in 1987, separated into seven separate companies known collectively as the Japan Railways Group (JR Group). * 1949 ‚Äì Foundation of Japanese National Railways as public corporation *1956 ‚Äì Completion of electrification of the T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line *1957 ‚Äì Opening of Ueno Zoo Monorail, Japan's first monorail *1958 ‚Äì Kodama, the first EMU express between Tokyo and Osaka *1960 ‚Äì Hatsukari, the first DMU express between Ueno (Tokyo) and Aomori * 1964 ‚Äì Opening of the first Shinkansen line, between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka *1975 ‚Äì Retirement of steam locomotives from all JNR services (switchers remained until 1976) *1980 ‚Äì JNR Reconstruction Act; low-profit lines were to be abandoned *1981 ‚Äì Opening of Portliner, Japan's first Automated guideway transit * 1987 ‚Äì Privatization of JNR, succeeded by the Japan Railways Group *1988 ‚Äì Opening of Seikan Tunnel connecting Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç *1988 ‚Äì Opening of Great Seto Bridge connecting Honsh≈´ and Shikoku Stage 4, 1987‚Äìpresent: The current situation Yamanashi test track After the privatization, the JR Group companies tried to improve their services, some of them being successful. At the same time, many local lines with lower ridership closed, since JRs are now private companies. Decades after motorization, railways in the countryside, often inconvenient with infrequent services, became less important for locals. The share of railways in total passenger kilometers fell from 66.7 percent in 1965 to 42 percent in 1978 and 29.8 percent in 1990. Fierce competition between railway operators put a great emphasis on efficiency, possibly more so than safety. Some think the Amagasaki derailment in 2005, which killed more than 100 passengers, is the result of such a trend. Rail transport in Japan retains its reputation for efficiency, capacity, punctuality, and technology through continuous improvements. The Port Liner, one of the first Automated guideway transit systems in the world, opened in 1981. In 1988 the zairaisen (3'6\\" gauge) networks of Hokkaido and Shikoku were connected to Honshu following the opening of the Seikan Tunnel (the longest railway tunnel in the world until 2016) and the Great Seto Bridge, with the Shinkansen network extended to Hakodate following the dual- gauging of the Seikan Tunnel in 2016. SCMaglev reached its world record speeds of in 2003 and in 2015, while the much slower Linimo, debuted in 2005, is the first maglev metro in the world. The development of Japan since 1872 is analogous to that of its rail network. Over this period, railways became the most important means of transport ‚Äì especially for the movement of passengers ‚Äì and they retain this role in the larger cities today. With many suburban cities having been developed by railway operators, the unchallenged importance of rail is something unique in the world.

Plot The movie is set in communist-ruled Yugoslavia during the 1950s. Zoran is an overweight 10-year-old living in an overcrowded home that his parents share with his grandmother, aunt and uncle. In the early communist era of Yugoslavia, many homes were taken away from their owners in the Land Reform programs. His parents are artists, and do not get along with his aunt and uncle, who think that they are communists. Zoran's family is opposed to Tito's rule, while little Zoran sees Tito as his personal hero. He's learned in school that Tito is the greatest man ever, and he daydreams about meeting him. One day, Zoran writes a composition called \\"Why I Like the President\\", which is judged the best of those submitted by Belgrade's schoolchildren. He wins a week's camping trip with other children of families favored by the regime, the trip's highlight being a reception at Tito's palace. His crush, Jasna, an orphan girl, also is going on this trip. The camping trip is led by a man named Raja, who quickly seems to be insane. The trip becomes increasingly absurd, with Raja and one of older boys Kengur (kagaroo, a nickname given his height) pretend to be ghosts to scare the kids while they are staying in a historic castle. Zoran is exposed by Raja for stealing a ring to give Jasna. He is going to be sent home on a train, and as he waits, a girl who is friendly with him walks over to his side. All of the students join, leaving only Raja and Jasna opposing him. They finish the journey and arrive at Tito's childhood home, and Zoran is asked to give a speech. He corrects his poem by saying that he in fact does love his parents more than Tito, and stating that he doesn't even like Tito that much. The film ends with a banquet where all of the kids get to meet Tito, but Zoran is disillusioned and doesn't really care to meet him.

She later studied medicine in Moscow. However, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the simultaneous breakout of the Somali Civil War in her native country forced her to apply for political asylum in neighboring Finland. She eventually received Finnish citizenship in 1998. Zahra currently lives in Lauttasaari, Helsinki. She speaks fluent Finnish, English, Somali, Arabic and Russian. Political career Working for a time as a midwife, Zahra later moved on to a career in politics. In the Finnish parliamentary elections of 2007, she came close to becoming the first Somali immigrant to be elected to the Parliament of Finland. However, very near the end of the vote counting, she was beaten out by fellow Green League candidate Outi Alanko-Kahiluoto by only a few hundred votes (4586 vs. 4174). In October of the following year, Zahra was elected to the Helsinki City Council with nearly 2,500 votes, \\"a large number of which were given in areas where immigrants hardly show up as a blip on the local population register.\\" Reasons cited for Zahra's success in the elections were her high educational level, and considerable local support for the Green League.

Brown (1905‚Äì1989) was an African-American journalist, newspaper baker, and leader in the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska. Part of the Great Migration, she came from Alabama via New York and Des Moines, NE. In Omaha, she and her husband founded and ran the Omaha Star, a newspaper of the African-American community. After 1945, Brown continued to run alone what was the only African-American newspaper in Omaha. It became the only newspaper of the African-American community in the state. She used its influence for education, community building, supporting the national civil-rights movement and opening up jobs for blacks. In the 1960s President Lyndon Johnson appointed her as a goodwill ambassador to East Germany. Brown was the first African American and one of only three women inducted into the Omaha Business Hall of Fame. She also has been posthumously inducted into the Nebraska Journalism Hall of Fame (2007) and the newly instituted Omaha Press Club Journalism of Excellence Hall of Fame (2008). Early life and family Mildred Brown was born in Bessemer, Alabama in 1905 to Rev. and Mrs. Bennie J. Brown, a prominent African-American family.Amy Helene Forss, \\"Mildred Brown put shine on Omaha Star\\", The Reader, 21 Aug 2008, accessed 28 Aug 2008 Her mother was a teacher.\\"Mildred Brown: Founder of the Omaha Star\\" , Nebraska Studies, accessed 27 May 2008 They encouraged her education. In 1931 Brown graduated from Miles College (then called Miles Memorial Teachers College), an historically black college (HBCU) founded in Birmingham, Alabama by the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church (CME Church). Brown worked as a teacher in Birmingham, where she met and married S. Edward Gilbert, a pharmacy graduate of Howard University. They moved to Chicago, where Brown studied at Chicago Normal College, and then to Des Moines, where she took journalism at Drake University. Brown started in journalism and started selling ads and writing news at the Silent Messenger in Sioux City, Iowa, where Gilbert was editor.\\"Black-owned paper thriving after 50 years\\", Lincoln Journal, 1988, p.31, scanned article on \\"Mildred Brown: Omaha Star Founder\\", Nebraska Studies, accessed 27 May 2008 At the invitation of a friend who invited them to his paper, in 1937 they moved to Omaha. Initially Brown worked as advertising manager. Career In 1938 the couple founded the Omaha Star; by 1945 it was the only remaining African-American newspaper in Omaha and the largest in the state. Brown was owner and publisher until her death in 1989. Still operating, it has become the longest-running newspaper in the city's history and is the only black paper printed in the state. Brown and Gilbert divorced in 1943, with Brown taking charge of the newspaper's operations as the \\"Advertising and General Manager\\". Brown used the newspaper as a way of expanding opportunities for the African-American community, especially for jobs. She hired young black men and provided scholarships for education. She refused to accept advertising from businesses that discriminated against blacks in hiring and also led customer boycotts of them to achieve change. Seeing the paper as a center of community journalism, she promoted positive news about accomplishments of individuals and groups. In the late 1940s, Brown became involved with Omaha's DePorres Club, a group of high school students and Creighton University students fighting against racial discrimination in Omaha. They led a sit-in at a cafe near the courthouse. After Creighton kicked the group off campus for too much activism, Brown volunteered the Star's office for use by the club. She also provided the group with her informal guidance and support. Restructuring of industry and loss of jobs produced hard years in Omaha. Brown's balanced coverage of the riots of the 1960s earned commendation from President Johnson. She continued her activism to persuade businesses to make more opportunities open to blacks. In the 1970s, Brown joined the Citizens Co-Ordinating Committee for Civil Liberties, better known as the 4CL. Created by prominent black church leaders, the group continued efforts for broader grassroots employment. They also added the issues of housing, civil rights, and social justice. As a well-known journalist and publisher, Brown had a wide circle of friends, who invited her on many travels for business, conventions, social events, and meetings with other publishers of black and white papers. Because of her prominent position in Nebraska's largest city, she also knew a wide array of politicians and national leaders. Brown lived in an apartment in the Omaha Star building in the North Omaha neighborhood from 1938 to her death in 1989. Her niece Marguerita Washington has continued to publish the newspaper.

The third named storm and second hurricane of the season, Caroline developed on August 24 north of the Dominican Republic. The system crossed Cuba and briefly degenerated into a tropical wave due to land interaction. However, upon emergence into the western Caribbean Sea, it was once again designated as a tropical depression after a well-defined circulation was observed on satellite imagery. Moving towards the west-northwest, the cyclone clipped the northern portion of the Yucat√°n Peninsula before entering the Gulf of Mexico. Caroline was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 29 in the central Gulf of Mexico before rapid intensification began. Early on August 31, Caroline reached its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), before landfall south of Brownsville, Texas with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) shortly thereafter. After moving inland, Caroline quickly weakened and dissipated over the mountainous terrain of northeastern Mexico on September 1\\\\. There were only two deaths from Caroline, both indirect. However, there was heavy rainfall in southern Texas and Mexico, including almost at Port Isabel. Meteorological history A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August 15 and rapidly moved westward at 17 mph (28 km/h) along the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). On August 18, the system turned northeast away from the ITCZ and slowed by the time it was 600 miles (965 km) northeast of Puerto Rico. On August 22 and 23, the system changed course for the second time as it turned to the southwest. By noon on August 24, satellite imagery showed the disturbance establishing a closed area of circulation with winds reaching 25 mph (40 km/h) and the barometric pressure falling to . The disturbance then became Tropical Depression Five as it neared northeastern Cuba and southeastern Bahamas. It crossed Cuba where it momentarily weakened back to a tropical wave. The cyclone then regained tropical depression status on August 27 as it continued westward into the Gulf of Mexico. Eye of Hurricane Caroline from Hurricane Hunters After brushing the northeastern tip of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Tropical Depression Five continued to move west at 8 mph (13 km/h) as the storm entered an area favorable for intensification. On August 29, the tropical system strengthened to a tropical storm and was named Caroline by the National Hurricane Center. By that time the storm was only east-southeast of Brownsville, Texas. Caroline's forward speed slowed to 5 mph (8 km/h) while intensifying and on the same day, Caroline was upgraded to hurricane status. Before making landfall, two hurricane hunter aircraft's flew into Caroline's center on August 30, where data collected from the aircraft showed a barometric pressure reading of and winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Six hours later the hurricane rapidly intensified, with winds reaching 115 mph (185 km/h) and the pressure dropping to . The pressure then fell to before the storm made landfall 100 miles (160 km) south of Brownsville on August 31. Caroline rapidly weakened to a tropical depression twelve hours after landfall and dissipated on September 1 over northeastern Mexico. Experiments Two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Research planes conducted experiments into Caroline. The experiments were to study and measure the wind velocity and the environment inside and around the eye as well as the boundary layer of the hurricane. The results of the experiments concluded that Caroline had a higher dissipation rate than normal hurricanes, with the dissipating rate averaging at 30%. This conclusion suggested that energy in a hurricane dissipating internally above the surface layer is two times higher than energy dissipating at the surface. Preparations and impact Storm total rainfall for Caroline Caroline brushed the southeastern Bahamas and made landfall in eastern Cuba as a tropical depression though its effects, if any, are unknown. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for coastal sections of south Texas and northern Mexico on August 30. Small water craft were also advised of the deteriorating conditions. In Texas, local officials in Cameron County opened storm shelters. Relief and clean up organizations were notified of the upcoming threat while several local oil rigs evacuated personnel. In addition, relief squads from the American Red Cross moved to South Texas in case the storm made landfall. Neil Frank, the director of the National Hurricane Center advised campers along the beaches to evacuate, stating that \\"he doesn't want them trapped\\". Due to Caroline‚Äôs compact size, sustained winds only reached 48 mph (78 km/h) in Brownsville, Texas. The storm also dropped heavy rain the southern portion of the state, as much as 11.93 in (302 mm) in Port Isabel. In Brownsville, Caroline broke a record for most rainfall within a 24-hour period during the month of August. The rainfall caused minor flooding. This helped end a prolonged drought in the Rio Grande Valley. It canceled most of the Labor Day holiday season for South Padre Island, one of the busiest weekends for tourism on the island. Caroline also produced storm tides 1‚Äì4 feet (0.3-1.2 m) above normal along coastal sections of southern Texas. Overall damage in southern Texas was minor, and there were two indirect fatalities due to drowning incidents in Galveston. In Mexico, coastal residents evacuated to storm shelters south of Tampico. Elsewhere, 300 residents were evacuated to storm shelters in Soto la Marina 55 miles (88 km) from Santa Rosa. In northeast Mexico, 150 residents evacuated to shelters in San Fernando, 85 miles (137 km) south of Brownsville. The storm produced 10 feet (3 m) storm tides to coastal sections of Mexico and 5-10 in (127‚Äì254 mm) of rain to inland areas. The rainfalls caused moderate flooding which caused 1,000 people to evacuate and left moderate damage to homes and businesses. The rains broke an eight-month drought that was affecting inland areas of northern Mexico that was affecting the area's corn production. Along the coast, several small villages sustained significant damage from the hurricane's storm surge.

It is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also known as White Columns or Columned Portals, as well as the George W. Peters House. The oldest part of the home was built in the 1860s as a four- room house, typical of an East Tennessee farmhouse. Behind the house there was a walkway across First Creek that connected the home with the owners' family business, the Peters & Bradley Mill, a grist mill. A major addition and renovation was undertaken in the 1880s by William E. Peters, using an architectural design by local architect George Franklin Barber. The addition more than doubled the size of the building. Its design displays Victorian and Neoclassical influences. A prominent feature is a large two-story front porch with columns. Original drawings for the expansion are held by the McClung Historical Collection. George Franklin Barber began publishing his homes in inexpensive, illustrated catalogs. He worked between 1887 and 1913, with a staff of approximately 50. Mr. Barber warned residents of the horrors of a house not designed by a trained architect, noting that Geo. F. Barber & Co. was \\"between you and a hideous monstrosity\\". Barber houses were primarily constructed in the United States, but were also found in other countries.

Its importance lies in the fact it is the first work concerning this taboo theme in the time of the previous totalitarian communist regime in Czechoslovakia. The situation at that time was that the number of addicts was growing, but it had not been publicly discussed. It warns that escaping from problems through drugs will end badly.

Biography=VOPRA years Mordvinov was born in the village of Zhuravlikha in Nizhny Novgorod Governorate of the Russian Empire. Mordvinov's early work, prior to his graduation from Moscow State Technical University (MVTU) in 1930, is definitely Constructivist, best seen in his Kharkiv Post Office of the late 1920s. In 1929-1932, Mordvinov, Karo Alabyan and Alexander Vlasov were the founding members of VOPRA, a group of young 'Proletarian Architects' who attacked proponents of the Constructivist movement, notably Ivan Leonidov, and all other \\"alien art\\" like eclectics, formalism and even baroque: \\"There is no class-free art, neither class-free architecture\\" (\\"–ë–µ—Å–∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —É –Ω–∞—Å –Ω–µ—Ç –∏ –±–µ—Å–∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤–æ–π –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä—ã —Ç–æ–∂–µ –Ω–µ—Ç\\" - Khan-Magomedov cites Mordvinov's March, 1928 speech). Mordvinov was also a vocal opponent of Le Corbusier's Tsentrosoyuz building. VOPRA was used by the state against free-minded modernist architects and to consolidate the profession under tight state control. VOPRA founders had no clear creative concept beyond these rhetorics, and could not be criticised for their art, since it never existed. They definitely understood the likely consequences of their political assaults and had no remorse for their victims (the age of show trials already began with Shakhty Trial and Industrial Party Trial). Executive career Despite the bitter war between VOPRA and modernist groups (ASNOVA, the OSA Group) there was an attempt to unify the architects within one voluntary union (MOVANO). With support from older generation (Alexey Shchusev), MOVANO existed in 1930-1932, however, VOPRA tried to destroy it from within and launched their own magazine, RA (Revolutionary Architecture), co-edited by Mordvinov; soon, he co-edited another magazine, SA (Soviet Architecture, 1931-1934). Formation of Union of Soviet Architects in 1932 allowed Mordvinov to move from small-time criticism to an executive position; he acquired bureaucratic muscle and set up his own workshop, present in all architectural contests of the 1930s. Mordvinov's 1930s version of stalinist architecture - compared with old revivalists like Ivan Zholtovsky - was more rationalist, lacking classical order, a simplified development of Ivan Fomin's Red Doric style. This is a direct consequence of his lack of academic training. According to Khan-Magomedov, Mordvinov was influenced by the Stenberg brothers, the draftsmen who rendered his early works. In fact, during the 1930s Mordvinov gradually accepted the rules of eclectics whom he had publicly nailed in 1928, and wilfully encouraged the arrest of unrepentant Modernists such as Mikhail Okhitovich, who Mordvinov publicly denounced, implicating him in Okhitovich's eventual murder. Moscow avenues His political campaigning was rewarded with a 1947 commission to rebuild the right side of Tverskaya Street. Mordvinov's architectural input may be disputed, but he proved himself a capable project manager, successfully implementing so- called flow methode of moving construction crews between buildings in different construction stages. This was followed by equally grand Leninsky Prospekt (1939-1940), Bolshaya Polyanka (1940), Moskva River embankments (1940-1941) and Novinsky Boulevard (1939-1941) projects. This work earned him Stalin Prize in 1941; incidentally, Mordvinov himself was on the Stalin Prize Board since its establishment in 1940. Since 1937, Mordvinov also enjoyed a management seat in the Union of Soviet Architects, has been President of Academy of Architecture (1950-1955) and International Union of Architects. Post-war reconstruction In 1943-1947, Mordvinov chaired the State Committee on Construction and Architecture, charged with rebuilding the damage of World War II. In particular, he supervised the first master plans of rebuilding Minsk and Smolensk His influence was reinforced by a 1947 commission to design one of the Moscow Skyscrapers, now known as the Hotel Ukraina, which he shared with Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky, one of the few Soviet experts in highrise construction. In 1955, Mordvinov received a public beating by Nikita Khrushchev for his expensive \\"architectural excesses\\", but even Khrushchev could not deny Mordvinov's management and planning skills. In 1956-1964, Mordvinov completed two major projects - redevelopment of Komsomolsky Prospekt and greenfield Cheryomushki District which became the symbol of Khrushchev's affordable housing initiative.

The objective of the organization was to unite various European conservative and Christian Democratic political organizations which formed in several Western European states during postwar reconstruction, the emerging Cold War and the beginnings of what would later be called European integration. During the 1950s and the 1960s, the CEDI was an important contact pool for European politicians. During its early years the CEDI's ideology and program was dominated by its first president, Otto von Habsburg, son of the last emperor of Austria. It was dissolved in 1990 following the collapse of the Iron Curtain.  Backgrounds  Francoist Spain made use of the CEDI to get in contact with high-ranking persons of the political, military, economic and cultural life from Western Europe and thus end its post-war international isolation. By preaching the necessity of cultural exchange and the religious unity of the occident, the CEDI aimed at a political, military and economic inclusion of Spain into the beginning process of European Integration.  Organization and members  The annual congresses of the CEDI, which were nearly always held in Spain, brought together many office bearers and dignitaries of the conservative milieu. Besides the Spanish initiators ‚Äì hereunder Franco‚Äôs foreign minister Alberto Mart√≠n Artajo, the director of the Institute for Hispanic Culture Alfredo S√°nchez Bella and Jos√© Ignacio Escobar Kirkpatrick Marqu√©s de Valdeiglesias ‚Äì there was a strong support for CEDI‚Äôs activities in Germany, Austria and France. The expelled Austrian Heir Apparent Otto von Habsburg was the founding and, later on, honorary president of the organization. Germany was represented by high- ranking members of the Christian Democratic and Christian Social Union of Bavaria parties, as for example the ministers Hans-Joachim von Merkatz and Richard Jaeger. The French section of the Documentation Centre was led by the Count Fran√ßois de la No√´ and Michel Habib-Deloncle. Among the first British supporters were William Teeling, Sir Frederick Corfield MP and Sir John Rodgers MP, who even held CEDI‚Äôs international presidency from 1965 to 1967. Over the years, the Austrian secretary general Georg von Gaupp-Berghausen turned more and more out to be the actual organizational and programmatic head of the Documentation Centre.  Ambitions and ideology  Besides the proclaimed Catholic Christian heritage, the traditional connections of the European upper nobility, military contacts and common economic interests, it was above all a virulent anticommunism which was tying together the members of the Documentation Centre. The scientific lectures given at the annual meetings of the CEDI dealt with questions of principle concerning European Integration, the Cold War and other subjects of social and international relevance.  National sections  Apart from Spain, Germany and France, national sections emerged in and Belgium and Austria, some years later also in Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Sweden and Portugal. In Britain, the conservative \\"March Club\\" fulfilled the tasks of a national section since the beginning of the 1960s. Among the most prominent members of this British section were apart from Teeling, Corfield and Rodgers, Peter Agnew and Geoffrey Rippon who both were to become international presidents of the CEDI later on. It seems quite likely that the contacts provided by the Documentation Centre played a not unimportant role in negotiating Britain‚Äôs entry into the European Community, since Rippon was the head of the British government‚Äôs delegation.  Development  When the CEDI became a civil law association in 1957, its head office was officially moved to Munich, Madrid remaining nevertheless a central branch office of the organization. With General Charles de Gaulle returning to the political stage in 1958, his fellows transformed the CEDI into an international forum in order to diffuse their conceptions of European politics. The cooperation between French Gaullists and German Christian Democrats has also been prepared by CEDI‚Äôs initiatives. The Gaullist engagement weakening by the end of the 1960s, Spanish influence in the Documentation Centre increased again. CEDI evolved into an instrument of Spanish interests in Latin America, reached out for Africa and Asia, and finally turned toward the domain of development policies. Nevertheless, the organization had transgressed the zenith of its diplomatic activities. The urgent necessity of recruiting new members was perceived, but the CEDI did not find any solution to solve these problems. The political transformation process in Spain by the middle of the 1970s deprived the CEDI of its last material and organizational basics.

Also known as the Adelia Armstrong Lutz House, the house was built in 1890 by John Lutz and his wife, artist Adelia Armstrong Lutz, on land given to them by Adelia's father, Robert H. Armstrong. In 1984, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architecture. The house stands on land that was once part of the large estate established by early Knoxville resident Drury P. Armstrong (1799-1856). Armstrong built Crescent Bend, which still stands nearby, in 1834. Robert H. Armstrong, a son of Drury, inherited a portion of his father's estate. The Bleak House, built in 1858, also still stands a few blocks from Westwood on Kingston Pike.Alice Howell, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 561-563. Westwood was designed in the Queen Anne style by the local architectural firm of Baumann Brothers. Unlike most Queen Anne houses extant in Knoxville, the house was executed in brick and stone, incorporating some Richardsonian Romanesque elements. The , 10-bedroom house has 10 fireplaces with custom mantels and decorative tiles. The front parlor features a hand-painted ceiling.Amy McCrary, \\"Historic Home to be Regional Center for Preservation,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, 17 September 2012. Retrieved: 17 September 2012. Adelia Armstrong Lutz was an accomplished painter who had studied at the Corcoran in Washington, D.C., the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and in Europe. She maintained an art studio in the house, in an unusual long room on the eastern side of the house that has a high ceiling, tall louvered windows, and skylights. Its hardwood floors are laid with alternating types of wood, creating a striped effect, and the walls are painted red. Westwood remained in the Lutz family until 2009, when the Lutzes' granddaughter died. In 2012, the house was purchased by the Aslan Foundation, which planned to restore the house and transfer it to the local historic preservation organization, Knox Heritage, for its offices. Restoration plans included removing a garage and a recreation room that was added in the 20th century, repainting in the style of the period, and updating the plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems.

It is significant for its use as a boundary demarcation historically, as well as presently. In the early 19th century, it separated the vast Rancho San Antonio to the south from the Castro family's Rancho San Pablo to the north. Today, it marks part of the boundary between Alameda County and Contra Costa County. The main stem, running through a deep canyon that separates Berkeley from Kensington, is joined below San Pablo Avenue by a fan of tributaries, their lower reaches mostly in culverts. The largest of these is Middle or Blackberry Creek, a southern branch. The creek is named for Albany Hill, formerly called Cerrito de San Antonio, a prominent (elevation 294 ft.) isolated hill on the shoreline of San Francisco Bay in Albany (The hill is now some distance inland due to Bay fill). Cerrito Creek, joined by a fan of other small creeks, formerly meandered to the Bay through a large marsh just north of the hill. History The creek played a part in history larger than its size. Because it divided the two land-grant ranches, it became the division between Alameda and Contra Costa counties. With Alameda County settled more densely in the early 20th- century boom that followed the San Francisco earthquake, the area just north of the county line became the home of jazz joints, gambling, brothels and other pursuits requiring a light hand from the law. This lasted until a post‚ÄìWorld War II reform movement in the City of El Cerrito. The marsh at the creek's mouth also played a curious bit part in history. Regarding such wetlands as useless, 19th- and 20th-century settlers set out to fill it, locating a slaughterhouse and dump there. An early 20th-century typhoid scare, however, led to closing of the dump. This left Berkeley, booming with new residents after the great San Francisco earthquake, without a place for its garbage. A new dump south of the hill was quickly arranged, in what is now the City of Albany. Women of that unincorporated area were upset, but they lacked the vote. One morning, they sought to turn back the garbage wagon with guns. Although they gave up when the sheriff ordered them to disperse, male residents who had formerly resisted incorporation then quickly voted to incorporate the city of Ocean View‚Äîsoon renamed Albany to avoid confusion with the Oceanview district of Berkeley. The marsh was eventually filled‚Äîrubble from dynamite making and quarrying on Albany Hill contributed. The creek was confined to a small channel, and in 1969 the City of El Cerrito built flood basins north of the creek in Creekside Park, a new park created as part of renewing the down-at-heel, flood-prone neighborhood that had grown up in the filled marsh. In 1953, the head of Stege Sanitary District wrote, \\"As late as 1920, records show a small lake bordered by marsh south of 'County Road No. 4' now Central, near Belmont. Nothing appears to justify use of this area for dwellings; and, the character of construction permitted in the past has involved a succession of unwise buyers of homes in losses and disappointments only partly compensated by sale to some newer victim.\\" Tides still rise and fall inland as far as Albany's and El Cerrito's Creekside Parks, respectively south and north of the creek. When a high tide coincides with winter storm runoff (greatly increased by the city's impermeable surfaces), the former marsh area can flood. Restoration Unsuccessful efforts to bring a portion of the creek out of a pipe when a former lumberyard became Albany Middle School in the 1990s led indirectly to the formation of Friends of Five Creeks, a citizens group. Volunteers with this group have worked since 1996 on this and other local creeks, principally removing invasives, planting natives, and installing amenities including signs and benches. The City of El Cerrito is committed to a long-term plan to \\"daylight\\" the still-culverted reaches of the creek at the south edge of El Cerrito Plaza, between San Pablo Avenue and the Ohlone Greenway (regional pedestrian/bicycle route under the BART tracks). The cities of Albany and El Cerrito have adopted a long-term plan for a pedestrian-bicycle route mostly along the creek, connecting the Ohlone Greenway to the Bay Trail. This plan is gradually being carried out. Friends of Five Creeks established some natives and placed a litter can at the short reach exposed at the Ohlone Greenway, but these plantings have repeatedly been devastated by maintenance workers. Between Talbot and Kains, adjacent to the El Cerrito Plaza shopping center, a state grant to the City of El Cerrito led to the channelized creek being re-contoured in 2003, giving it a more natural flow pattern, native vegetation, and a creekside trail. This project, maintained and improved by Friends of Five Creeks, has been successful. The channelized south bank between San Pablo Avenue and Pierce Street was \\"torn up\\" by a sewer replacement project in 1998‚Äì99 Pierce Street.Cerrito Creek at Pierce. Cerrito Creek Virtual Tour. 2011. Retrieved 03-02-2011. As part of that project, the Urban Creeks Council was instrumental in having the old sewer pipe broken up so that steelhead could again access Middle Creek. (These anadromous fish have been observed in the creek but there is no evidence of recent successful reproduction.) The City of Albany used mitigation funds to establish native vegetation on the north bank, but the project was rapidly re- invaded by invasives such as blackberry, Cape ivy, and morning glory when that money ran out. Friends of Five Creeks began intensive work between San Pablo and Pierce in 2000, beginning on the north bank at Pacific East Mall, carrying out restoration required in the mall's use permit. Tasks included removing fencing, building a creekside trail, removing evergreen thornless blackberries that formed thickets more than high and spanned the creek, and establishing native vegetation. This revegetation has been reasonably successful, although the mall's maintenance contractors sprayed much of the grassland areas with herbicide, and these native grasses have never been re-established. The mall was required to re-plant shrubs, carry out long-promised pollution reduction, and improve its maintenance as a result of this incident.Garden Variety: An Ecological Calamity Below Albany Hill. Ron Sullivan. Berkeley Daily Planet. 26-01-2007. Retrieved 23-01-2011. Since 2004, Friends of Five Creeks volunteers have focused on the reach from Adams Street downstream to Pierce Street. The largest task continues to be removing evergreen thornless blackberry, which quickly clogs the creek and increases flooding. With help from both cities, volunteers also have removed other invasives, planted natives, and installed amenities such as benches, signs, and a table in the Creekside Parks facing each other in Albany and El Cerrito.Friends of Five Creeks Restoration Project Parkland extends to most of Albany Hill, with grasslands, a willow grove at the mouth of Middle Creek, and mature oak forest on the steep north face of the hill. Thus this complex is an unusual island of urban green space and habitat surrounded by city. Wildlife includes sticklebacks, Pacific chorus frogs, herons, egrets, kingfishers, ducks, hawks, raccoons, and deer.

The house's foundation was built by Governor John Sevier in the 1790s, and the house itself was built by Knoxville merchant and mayor, James Park (1770-1853), in 1812, making it the second- oldest building in Downtown Knoxville after Blount Mansion. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and currently serves as the headquarters for the Gulf and Ohio Railways. History=Early history The James Park House sits on what was originally Lot 59 in Charles McClung's 1791 plat of Knoxville.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 464-466, map between pages 32 and 33. Sevier purchased the lot and began construction of the brick foundation of the house in the 1790s, and completed a portion of the wall facing Cumberland Avenue. Due to financial difficulties, however, he abandoned the house's construction, and moved to his farm at Marble Springs, on the city's periphery. Sevier sold the lot to his son, George Washington Sevier, in 1801, and the younger Sevier in turn sold it to South Carolina merchant James Dunlap in 1807.Samuel Gordon Heiskell, Andrew Jackson and Early Tennessee History (Nashville: 1918), pp. 199-200. In 1812, the lot with its unfinished house was purchased by James Park, a Scots-Irish merchant from County Donegal, Ireland, who had arrived in Knoxville in 1798. According to some historians, the original wing of Park's house was designed by Thomas Hope, an early Knoxville architect who also designed the Ramsey House and Statesview.William MacArthur, Jr., Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South (Tulsa, Oklahoma: Continental Heritage Press, 1982), p. 23. Likely before 1820, Park added a second wing to the house, giving it its characteristic L-shape. Park served as mayor of Knoxville from 1818 to 1821, and again from 1824 until 1826. In 1839, he lost Knoxville's first popular mayoral election to W.B.A. Ramsey by one vote.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 16, 76, 415-416, 483. Park and his wife, Sophia Moody, had 12 children, some of whom were born in the Park House. President Andrew Jackson stayed at the Park House on a visit to Knoxville in 1830. Reverend James Park The Rev. James Park (1822-1912) Park's eleventh child, also named James Park, was born in the Park House in 1822. The younger James Park graduated from East Tennessee College in 1840 and from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1846, after which he was licensed as a Presbyterian preacher. He briefly served as co-principal of the East Tennessee Female Institute before moving to Rogersville in the 1850s to preach at that city's First Presbyterian Church. He returned to Knoxville in 1860 to accept a position as principal of the Tennessee School for the Deaf (then located in what is now Old City Hall). During the Civil War, Park moved to his country home in Cedar Springs (in what is now West Knoxville). In late 1863, General James Longstreet, whose army was attempting to retake Knoxville from an occupying Union force, dined at Park's Cedar Springs house.Oliver P. Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1995), pp. 509-510. Park later recalled that Longstreet had an inaccurate map that showed the confluence of the French Broad and Holston rivers to be below Knoxville, and refused to believe Park when he pointed out that the confluence was actually upriver from Knoxville. After the war, Park was appointed preacher of Knoxville's First Presbyterian Church, and he moved into the James Park House, where he would live for most of the remainder of his life. An 1871 map of Knoxville shows the house surrounded by a grove of trees and a few outbuildings, with the St. John's Episcopal Church (predecessor of St. John's Cathedral) across Cumberland to the north.A. Ruger, \\"Bird's Eye View of the City of Knoxville, Knox County, Tennessee,\\" Merchants Lith Co., 1871. Retrieved from the Library of Congress online database, 2 March 2011. An 1886 map, on the other hand, shows the house surrounded by the church and numerous smaller houses, reflecting Knoxville's rapid post-war growth.H. Wellge, \\"Knoxville, Tenn., County Seat of Knox County,\\" Norris, Wellge & Co., 1886. Retrieved from the Library of Congress online database, 2 March 2011. 20th century The James Park House, as it appeared circa 1918 After Park's death in 1912, his house was sold and converted into office space. The house was used as a Red Cross workshop during World War I, and served as a medical clinic in the years following the war. In 1945, the Knoxville Academy of Medicine, headed by prominent physician Herbert Acuff (who was also instrumental in constructing the nearby Medical Arts Building), purchased and renovated the house. The Academy used the house for several decades before relocating to West Knoxville. In 2002, Gulf and Ohio Railroads CEO Pete Claussen and his wife, Linda, purchased the house for use as the Gulf and Ohio's headquarters. Working with architect Lee Ingram of the firm, Brewer Ingram Fuller, the Claussens removed several modern elements and restored the house to its 19th- century appearance. These changes included the removal of a 1968 rear medical auxiliary and auditorium, and the restoration of the house's Victorian-era porch. The renovations were largely completed in 2007.Amy McRary, \\"A Beacon For History.\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, 28 June 2007. Retrieved: 2 March 2011. Design The James Park House is a two-and-a-half story L-shaped house with a modern service wing located at the rear. Claussen's restorations, guided in part by old photographs and architectural research, included the re-addition of a picket fence surrounding the property, reconstruction of the house's Victorian-style front porch, rebuilding of the front stairs, and the reshaping of the chimneys. An arched fireplace in the basement, the design of which is nearly identical to a fireplace in the nearby Craighead-Jackson House, was also restored. The floors of the modern addition to the house have been painted with various historical maps of Knoxville. One of the house's restrooms contains a ceiling-to-floor safe. Another restroom is modeled after the restroom of the Red Sage restaurant in Washington, D.C. A windowpane in the house contains the name \\"Sallie,\\" which was probably etched by a daughter of the Reverend James Park. ReferencesResources * Isenhour, Judith Clayton.

The route runs from DE 100 near Montchanin east to U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Claymont. The road is a two-lane rural road between the western terminus and US 202, passing through Brandywine Creek State Park. East of US 202, DE 92 is a four-lane divided highway called Naamans Road that passes through suburban areas to the north of Wilmington, with an interchange at Interstate 95 (I-95) in Claymont. DE 92 was first built as a state highway east of US 202 during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1968, the route was designated onto its current alignment. In the 1990s, DE 92 east of US 202 was widened into a divided highway. Route description Eastbound DE 92 past intersection with US 202 north of Wilmington DE 92 begins at the intersection with DE 100 and Adams Dam Road near Montchanin. The route runs northeast on a two-lane undivided road called Thompson Bridge Road, crossing Wilson Run and passing through farmland to the north of Brandywine Creek State Park. The road continues into forested areas of the state park, crossing the Brandywine Creek. After the state park, DE 92 heads into areas of fields within the Beaver Valley section of First State National Historical Park, continuing northeast along Ramsey Road before curving to the north. The route turns east onto Beaver Valley Road, widening into a four-lane divided highway as it passes south of business parks and north of the Brandywine Campus of Wilmington University before it intersects US 202 in Brandywine. Past the US 202 intersection, DE 92 becomes Naamans Road and passes to the south of Brandywine Town Center shopping center, where a park and ride lot is located, as it continues into residential and commercial areas and intersects Shipley Road. Past the Brandywine Town Center, the route heads through neighborhoods in Brandywine Hundred and passes to the south of Concord High School before intersecting Ebright Road, which goes north to Ebright Azimuth (the highest point in Delaware) and into Pennsylvania. After this, the road comes to an intersection with DE 261 in Ways Corner. Westbound DE 92 past intersection with DE 261 north of Wilmington Farther east, DE 92 reaches a junction with the northern terminus of DE 3 in Hanbys Corner. Past the Darley Road intersection, the route passes north of a church that is home to a park and ride lot. From here, the road intersects Carpenter Station Road in Carpenter, where there is a park and ride lot on the southeast corner, before it crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line and turns to the east- southeast. The route heads into business areas in Claymont and comes to an interchange with I-95 at the northern terminus of I-495. After the I-95 interchange, DE 92 passes to the south of the Tri-State Mall and crosses Naamans Creek before it has a westbound right-in/right-out intersection with the southern terminus of DE 491\\\\. Past this intersection, the route turns southeast before ending at US 13 south of the Robinson House. DE 92 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 30,848 vehicles at the Harvey Road intersection to a low of 6,643 vehicles at the Creek Road intersection. The portion of DE 92 east of US 202 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what is now DE 92 originally existed as a county road, with the portion east of Foulk Road proposed to become a state highway. The state highway between Foulk Road and Philadelphia Pike was completed four years later. By 1931, the portion of road between Grubb Road and Foulk Road was upgraded to a state highway. The state highway portion was extended west to Concord Pike by 1936. By 1968, DE 92 was designated onto its current alignment between DE 100 and US 13, with the easternmost portion replacing what had been designated a part of US 13 Bypass. DE 92 was widened into a divided highway by 1997 between US 202 and DE 261 and between DE 3 and DE 491. Two years later, the road was upgraded to a divided highway between DE 261 and DE 3.

He moved to Tokyo in 1886 to attend the English Law College (the forerunner of Chuo University, but soon dropped out to devote himself to writing full-time. The start of his career was hardly auspicious. When he brought a sample of his writing to Mori ≈ågai, he was encouraged to ‚Äúlook for another profession‚Äù. Undeterred, he visited Ozaki K≈çy≈ç, who confided to Izumi Ky≈çka that Kosugi would ‚Äúnever realize his ambition‚Äù to become a novelist. However, in 1890, Kosugi became a disciple of literary critic and satirical author Sait≈ç Ryokuu, and began writing political novels under Sait≈ç‚Äôs direction. page 52 He was hired by the literary magazine Shincho gekan in 1897, but was transferred by the magazine to the newspaper H≈çchi Shimbun. He published his first novel, Hatsusugata, a story about a geisha and her relationship with men from different social strata in 1900. He followed with a sequel, Hayariuta, in 1902, which was one of his most successful works. Kosugi attempted to write in a realistic and objective manner, without intruding the thoughts or comments of the author into the story narrative, which was considered rather revolutionary for the time. In the forward to Hatsusugata, he commented that he \\"seeks to move the reader not by the unusual, but by what is normal and average.\\".Hijiya-Kirschnereit. Rituals of Self-Revelation. page 22. Familiar with Zola and other French authors, his experimentation towards realism is considered a forerunner of a Japanese style of naturalism. Although often compared to his contemporary, Nagai Kaf≈´, Kosugi has been criticized for having two-dimensional characters who meet predictable fates based on family or environmental situations. Kosugi was elected to the Japan Art Academy in 1948. In his later years, he also turned towards the genre of historical fiction.

It is one of the highly anticipated sports tourism events in the Philippines.  History  In 1993 a local sailing event was organized called The Easter Regatta which drew five local participants sailing from Subic Bay to Caylabne Bay in the mouth of Manila Bay. Merkano, an S&S36; skippered by Azelio Beano, won the Racing class, while Airtight Garage, a Humprhies half tonner skippered by Alan Burrel, won the Cruising class. The pioneer organizers of the event were MYC Commodore Ray Ordoveza, MYC Race Committee Chairman George Hackett, Jerry Rollin, and Allen Lundy. The next year in the organizers of the Easter Regatta suggested to the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, organizers of the China Sea Race (a biannual race from Hong Kong to Manila Bay), to integrate the Easter regatta in their race schedule. A course was made to race from off Manila Yacht Club, to Corregidor island, and then a next leg from Corregidor to Subic Bay. That sparked the interest of international participants. In 1995 though a China Sea Race \\"off year\\", attracted more international participants as the RHKYC organizes the Hong Kong to San Fernando race. Participants of this race readily sailed down the coast to Subic Bay to participate in the Easter Regatta held in Subic Bay. Big names included Neil Pryde, Olympic yachtsman Grey Gibson, and Andy Lam and Joy Ride a J35 which won the previous year's China Sea Race series. In 1996 RHKYC and MYC decided to organize the finish of the China Sea Race at Subic Bay, this meant that there were more boats interested in joining the Easter Regatta as well. Beau Geste, an ILC skippered by Karl Kwok, as well as local boats Vida of Ray Ordoveza and helmed by Olympic medalist Steve Benjamin, Body Shots, helmed by J24 world champion David Bedford, Suicide Blond a Mumm 36 and another Mumm 36 Intabinda chartered by Neil Pryde after his boat Boogie Flash suffered damage six hours after the start of China Sea Race, he returned to Hong Kong and flew to Manila and then to Subic to join the racing.  The President's Cup  Then Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos, impressed by the success of Ray Ordoveza's \\"Vida\\" in the China Sea Race and Easter Regatta, encouraged the Manila Yacht Club to organize an International regatta at Subic in 1997. Thus the Easter Regatta was renamed \\"The President's Cup Regatta\\". A perpetual trophy was specially designed for the President's Cup. The first President's Cup Regatta also drew participation from one-design sportsboats, to dinghies to beach catamarans. All in all 81 boats participated in the event with participants and crew from all over the world including North America, Europe, New Zealand and of course Hong Kong. Local participants included \\"Vida\\", \\"Triple V Centennial\\" a Bashford 36 skippered by Thomas Hovenshiold. Triple V Centennial became the first yacht name to be engraved on the base of the perpetual trophy of the President's Cup Regatta. In 1998 the China Sea Race organizers decided that the President's Cup Regatta should be the inshore series part of the China Sea Race thus scores in the President's Cup counted towards the China Sea Race series. This assured international participation in the President's Cup from then on. That year saw new boats being raced to contest the coveted perpetual trophy. No less than 3 new Sydney 46s owned by Neil Pryde, Klaus Lienau and the Subic Centential Syndicate. \\"Karakoa\\", Ray Ordoveza's new Excel 53, was the winner of the perpetual trophy, while \\"Hocux Pocux\\" of David Kong won the China Sea Race series. \\"Team Windshear / Jo de Ros\\", George and Rainbow Hackett's J-35 won the Cruiser/Racer Class. \\"Tatoosh\\" won the Cruising class. The President's Cup has not taken place since 2009 when the Commodore's Cup was moved by SAGS to replace it. This led to the Manila Yacht Club filing a TRO against the Subic Bay sailing group SAGS and Jerry Rollin.

Taxonomy The Armenian mouflon was first described in 1840 by Edward Blyth, who equated it with the \\"Orientalische Schaaf\\" (Oriental sheep) described by Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin in 1774. Transcription of Blyth's presentation to a session of the Zoological Society of London chaired by Professor Owen. Alternate copy at BHL (no subscription required); description of \\"O. Gmelinii\\" begins on p. 69. It is known as the Armenian mouflon in both (, haykakan muflon and , Qutch-e armani). Alternative names include Armenian sheep,Valdez, R. (2008) Ovis orientalis The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Armenian wild sheep, Armenian red sheep, and Trans-Caucasian sheep. English translation of the Russian-language Mlekopitaiushchie Sovetskogo Soiuza (1961) by the Smithsonian Institution's Translation Publishing Program. Distribution and population O. g. gmelini is found in northwestern Iran. Armenian mouflons were transferred to Kabudan Island in Lake Urmia in 1895 and 1906 by one of the governors of Azerbaijan. A study carried out in the 1970s at the island found that their number declined from around 3,500 in 1970 to 1,000 in 1973. In 2004 1,658 Armenian wild sheep were counted at the Angouran Protected Area in Iran's Zanjan Province. O. g. gmelini is found in Syunik Province in southern Armenia (and to a lesser extent, in the provinces of Ararat and Vayots Dzor). According to a 2009 study there were \\"hardly over 200\\" mouflons in Armenia. An estimated 250 to 300 mouflons are found in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. Habitat O. o. gmelini on a 2012 Armenian stamp The Armenian mouflon lives mostly in open rough terrain at medium or high altitudes, where they inhabit rocky hill country, lowland and highland steppes, rocky semideserts, grass-covered slopes, and alpine meadows. They spend the summer at the highest elevations, right below the permanent snow. In winter, they move lower and may come into the valleys. They live in small or large herds, and in the summer, the older males live singly or in separate groups. They may live up to 18 years. Protection measures O. g. gmelini was listed in Category I of the USSR Red Data Book. In Armenia, hunting it has been forbidden since 1936. A captive-breeding program has been initiated at the Zoological Institute of Armenia aiming to expand Khosrov Nature Reserve, reorganize the Orbubad Sanctuary into a state reserve, control livestock, and reduce poaching. As of 2011, the fine for hunting the Armenian mouflon in Armenia was 3 million drams (roughly $8,000). In Iran, hunting of O. g. gmelini is allowed only under permit, outside the protected areas, between September and February. Within the protected areas, grazing of domestic livestock is strictly controlled.

Tsen (, April 2, 1898 ‚Äì October 1, 1940), given name Chiung (), was a Chinese mathematician born in Nanchang, Jiangxi. He is known for his work in algebra. He was one of Emmy Noether's students at the University of G√∂ttingen. One of his research interests was quasi-algebraic closure. In that area he proved a fundamental result which is now called Tsen's theorem. Biography Tsen was born in a poor fisherman's family in Xinjian Country, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province. His father Tschu-Wun Tsen () had two sons and several daughters, and Tsen was the eldest son. His uncle Lei Heng (), who was a jinshi and a member of the Hanlin Academy, persuaded Tsen's father to send Tsen to school. Due to poverty, Tsen had to take leaves from school intermittently to work. After leaving primary school, he worked in a coal mine while self-studying. In 1917, he passed the entrance examination and was admitted to Jiangxi Provincial First Normal College in Nanchang. He was subsidised by Lei Heng's son Tsebu S. Lee (), who was studying in Japan on government scholarship. After graduation in 1920, Tsen taught in primary school for two years. In 1922, Tsen entered National Wuchang Senior Normal College, later National Wuchang University, to study undergraduate mathematics, and he graduated in 1926. After graduation, he worked as teacher in high schools for two years to perform the mandatory teaching service of his degree. In 1927, when Kuomintang split with the Chinese Communist Party, Tsen and some teachers and students protested against the breakup and called for alliance. Several of them including Tsen were beaten up and were sent to hospital. Guo Moruo, then serving as director of the political department of the National Revolutionary Army, visited them in the hospital. In 1928, Tsen passed the Jiangxi provincial government scholarship examination for studying in Europe and America. He went to Berlin University for language training for a year, and then he started studying mathematics at University of G√∂ttingen in the summer semester of 1929. He studied algebra under Emmy Noether. Tsen received his doctoral degree in February 1934 under the supervision of Emmy Noether and Friedrich Karl Schmidt, and he dedicated his dissertation to his elder cousin Tsebu S. Lee. Having fled to the US, Noether evaluated the dissertation in a letter as \\"sehr gut\\" (very good). As a research fellow sponsored by the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, Tsen did a postdoctoral research with Emil Artin at Hamburg University for a year. There he became friend with Shiing-Shen Chern, who was a graduate student back then. Chern remembered him as a cordial and open-minded person well-liked by everyone. Tsen returned to China in July 1935 and was invited by Chen Jiangong to National Chekiang University in Hangzhou as professor in the area of algebra. Chen was Tsen's teacher at Wuchang Senior Normal College and had encouraged Tsen to study in Germany. Tsen taught a course on algebra and a course on group theory based on the German textbooks of van der Waerden and Andreas Speiser respectively. As the books were in German, it was not easy for the students to understand, so he edited the notes taken by his student Chuan- Chih Hsiung and printed out for the students. In 1936, Tsen published his third paper in the journal of the new Chinese Mathematical Society. The paper contained the work that he had done in Hamburg, and he dedicated it to the memory of his advisor Noether, who died in the previous year. The paper was hardly known outside China before 1970s, and the results therein were rediscovered by Serge Lang in his dissertation. Ernst Witt, who was Tsen's friend and had also been a student of Noether, always talked about Tsen's results in his algebra lectures and would correct others if they attributed them to Lang but not Tsen, thus helped bring attention to this paper. Tsen and Chen fell out because of a failed matching of Tsen and Chen's younger sister for marriage. In 1937, Tsen left Chekiang University and was invited by National Beiyang Institute of Technology to become a professor. That year, the full-scale Japanese invasion of China started, and the school was evacuated from Tianjin to Xi'an. Tsen went to Xi'an to take up his post. The school merged with some other evacuated universities to form National Xi'an Provisory University. The new university moved to Hanzhong and was renamed to National Northwestern Associated University, and it moved again to Chenggu. The university soon split into several schools, one of which was National Northwestern Institute of Technology, and Tsen became a professor of this school. In 1939, Shu-tien Li, former president of Beiyang Institute of Technology and the president of the newly-founded National Xikang Institute of Technology, invited Tsen to be a professor at the new school. The campus of the school was temples scattered on in the suburb of Xichang in Xikang Province. Tsen had a chronic stomach problem, and his condition was made worse by poor living condition and shortage of medical supplies in time of war. Tsen died of a stomach ulcer in Xichang, Xikang on October 1, 1940, and the school held a memorial service for him on November 18, 1940. Tsen's death reported by the journal Xin Ningyuan Yuekang, Vol. 1, No. 3. He married a high-school chemistry teacher Qin Hesui () in Nanchang in 1937. His wife suffered a miscarriage on the long and difficult journey over mountainous terrains to Xichang. They had no children. He adopted a nephew as his son. He bought a lot of mathematics books while in Germany, and he brought the books and his manuscripts back to China in seven full metal trunks. After the start of war, he kept them in his relative's home at a village in Xinjian, Jiangxi. Unfortunately, when the village had fallen, all his seven trunks of books and manuscripts were burnt by the Japanese invaders. Publications *Tsen, Chiungtze C.

He was an illegitimate son of a textile manufacturer and inherited a substantial estate, which he spent almost entirely on vellum manuscripts and, when out of funds, borrowed heavily to buy manuscripts, thereby putting his family deep into debt. Phillipps recorded in an early catalogue that his collection was instigated by reading various accounts of the destruction of valuable manuscripts.N. A. Basbanes: A Gentle Madness, p. 120 Such was his devotion that he acquired some 40,000 printed books and 60,000 manuscripts, arguably the largest collection a single individual has created, and coined the term \\"vello-maniac\\"Basbanes, op. cit. p. 121 to describe his obsession, which is more commonly termed bibliomania. The Collection Broadway Tower, Worcestershire. The home of Phillipps' Middle Hill Press In 1808, when Phillipps was 16 years old, he already owned 112 books (largely Gothic chapbooks). Later in life he is recorded to have said that he wanted to own one of every book in the world. Philipps began collecting in earnest while still at Rugby, and his manuscript catalog from 1811, now at the Grolier Club, shows a turn in his collecting from 1808. He continued buying books when he went on to University College OxfordGrolier Club and graduated in 1815. In 1820, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.Alan Bell, 'Phillipps, Sir Thomas, baronet (1792‚Äì1872)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, (2004) A. N. L. Munby notes that, \\"[Phillipps] spent perhaps between two hundred thousand and a quarter of a million pounds[,] altogether four or five thousand pounds a year, while accessions came in at the rate of forty or fifty a week.\\".Nicolas Barker: Portrait of an Obsession: The Life of Sir Thomas Phillipps, the world‚Äôs greatest book collector, 1967. Phillipps would go into book shops and purchase the entire stock; he would receive dealers catalogues and buy all the listings; his agents bought entire lots of books at auction, outbidding his rival the British Museum. His country seat, Middle Hill near Broadway, Worcestershire gave over sixteen of twenty rooms to books. Still life with ancient Babylonian artifacts on books, salted paper print, 1853, by Amelia Elizabeth Guppy In 1850 at a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological society (Cymdeithas Hynafiaethau Cymru), Phillips announced that he was seeking to locate his large collection at a location in Wales. He employed a distant relative by marriage, Amelia Elizabeth Guppy, to photograph some of his collection in 1853 including artefacts from Babylon and Utrecht. In 1863, Phillipps began to move the collection as he was fearful that his son-in-law, James Orchard Halliwell, would gain ownership of it when Phillipps's estranged daughter inherited Middle Hill. Halliwell was apparently a book thief (Phillips accused Halliwell of stealing his 1603 copy of Hamlet which he sold to the British Museum minus the title page containing Phillipps' book stamp) and also a destroyer of other valuable old books, cutting out pages to stick them in his scrapbook. At least 105 wagon-loads, each drawn by two horses and accompanied by one or two men, were used to move the collection to Thirlestaine House in Cheltenham over a period of eight months, leaving Middle Hill to fall to ruin.Michell, John F (1999). Eccentric Lives and Peculiar Notions. Adventures Unlimited Press, p. 160. The previous owner of Thirlestaine House was John Rushout, 2nd Baron Northwick, whose important art collection had been sold in 1859 after he died intestate.Catalogue of the late Lord Northwick's extensive and magnificent collection of ancient and modern pictures, cabinet of miniatures and enamels... sold by 'Mr. Phillips'. (1859) There are thus numerous MSS named \\"Codex Middlehillianus\\", \\"Cheltenham Codex\\" or \\"Codex Cheltenhamensis\\".e.g. Codex Cheltenhamensis 9303, containing the Lingua Ignota by Hildegard of Bingen. Steinmayer E; Sievers, E. (1895). Sachlich geordnete Glossare. Die Althochdeutschen Glossen, Vol. III. pp. 390-404. Phillipps' collection included another manuscript of a work by Hildegard, one of the earliest copies of her Liber Vite Meritorum, now Berlin, Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Ms. theol.lat. fol. 727; see Hildegardis Bingensis, Liber Vite Meritorum, ed. A. Carlevaris (Turnout: Brepols, 1996), p. xlvii. On his death in 1872 the probate valuation (by Edward Bond of the British Museum) of his manuscripts was ¬£74,779 17s 0d. His success as a collector owed something to the dispersal of the monastic libraries following the French Revolution and the relative cheapness of a large amount of vellum material, in particular English legal documents, many of which owe their survival to Phillipps. He was an assiduous cataloguer who established the Middle Hill Press (‚ÄòTypis Medio-Montanis‚Äô) in 1822 not only to record his book holdings but also to publish his findings in English topography and genealogy.The Horblit collection of Middle Hill Press books at the Grolier Club contains 558 titles, The press was housed in Broadway Tower, a folly completed on Broadway Hill, Worcestershire, in 1798. Thirlestaine House, Phillipps' home during the latter part of his life During his lifetime, Phillipps attempted to turn over his collection to the British nation and corresponded with the then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Disraeli in order that it should be acquired for the British Museum. Negotiations proved unsuccessful and, ultimately, the dispersal of his collection took over 100 years. Phillipps's will stipulated that his books should remain intact at Thirlestaine House, that no bookseller or stranger should rearrange them and that no Roman Catholic, especially his son-in-law James Halliwell, should be permitted to view them.Basbanes, op. cit, p. 122 In 1885, the Court of Chancery declared this too restrictive and thus made possible the sale of the library which Phillipps's grandson Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick supervised for the next fifty years. Significant portions of the European material were sold to the national collections on the continent including the Royal Library, Berlin, the Royal Library of Belgium, and the Provincial Archives (:nl:Gemeentearchief) in Utrecht as well as the sale of outstanding individual items to the J. Pierpont Morgan and Henry E. Huntington libraries. By 1946, what was known as the \\"residue\\" was sold to London booksellers Phillip and Lionel Robinson for ¬£100,000, though this part of the collection was uncatalogued and unexamined. The Robinsons endeavoured to sell these books through their own published catalogues and a number of Sotheby's sales. The final portion of the collection was sold by Christie's on 7 June 2006, lots 18‚Äì38.Christie's, sale 7233, Valuable Manuscripts and Printed Books, London, King Street, 7 June 2006, lots 18‚Äì38. A five-volume history of the collection and its dispersal, Phillipps Studies, by A. N. L. Munby was published between 1951 and 1960. Family Phillipps married Henrietta Elizabeth Molyneux, daughter of Major-General Thomas Molyneux, in 1819.Curious Britain: Broadway Tower This was after the death of his father, who had opposed the match because she lacked a dowry. In 1821, he was made baronet of Middle Hill in the County of Worcester at the age of 29. The honour was the result of his father- in-law's connections with the Duke of Beaufort. He was appointed High Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1825.Annual register 1825, Volume 67,p.192 edited by Edmund Burke Phillipps' eldest daughter, Harriett, married the Shakesperean scholar James Orchard Halliwell. While still an undergraduate at Cambridge, Halliwell had collaborated in research with Phillipps. He came to visit Thomas Phillipps in February 1842 and became attached to Harriett. Phillipps refused to allow his daughter to marry and the couple eloped. Phillipps was enraged by this and maintained a lifelong vendetta against the couple. As the Phillippses had only daughters the title became extinct on his death in February 1872, aged 79. He was buried at the Church of St Aldhelm and St Eadburgha at Broadway in Worcestershire.

It replaced the former Institute of Business Consulting (IBC) in January 2011, which was itself formed as the merger of two predecessor bodies, the Institute of Management Consultants (IMC) and the Institute of Business Advisors (IBA). The Institute of Consulting is an organisation within the Chartered Management Institute (CMI). The IC offers several grades of membership, qualifications, training and awards as well as a range of tools and resource to support members. The institute also operates an accreditation process for its members. History During a conference held in Paris during the 1950s, the Big Four consultancy companies at that time agreed to form the Management Consultancies Association. This was developed further into a professional institute and the Institute of Management Consultants came into being in 1962. Having changed its name during the 1990s to the Institute of Management Consultancy to enable corporate membership, the organisation began discussions about merging with the CMI in 2005. This led to the IMC becoming an organisation within the CMI later that year, but the two institutes remained as separate entities. At the time of the merger with CMI, the IMC were themselves approached by the Institute of Business Advisors (IBA) about combining membership. After lengthy discussions, the IMC and IBA merged in 2007 to become the Institute of Business Consulting, an amalgamation of their two previous names. Both the IBC and CMI suffered as a result of the recession caused by the financial crisis of 2008. In 2010, the organisations established closer working links and relationships and, following feedback from members and the changing scope of their work, removed the word 'business' from the name, becoming the Institute of Consulting. Membership There are 4 grades of membership within the IC: * Affiliate ‚Äì For anyone starting out in the consultancy field with little or no experience, or for anyone who just has an interest in consultancy and wishes to keep up to date with the profession. There is a sub-grade for those studying, Studying Affiliate, for individuals who are enrolled on an IC qualification course or are undertaking study outside of the IC, offering the Affiliate membership grade at a discount rate. * Associate (AIC) ‚Äì For individuals who have a small amount of experience in the consultancy or advisory fields. This grade offers resources for Continuous Personal Development free to members. Associates are entitled to use the postnominals AIC after their name to indicate their membership. * Member (MIC) ‚Äì The most popular grade, for individuals who have at least three years experience as a consultant or business adviser. Members are entitled to use postnominals MIC after their name to indicate their accreditation and membership. * Fellow (FIC) ‚Äì The highest grade of membership available, requiring at least 10 years experience, of which three must be at a strategic level. Fellow membership of the IC provides additional benefits including the possibility of becoming a mentor. Fellows are entitled to use the postnominals FIC after their name to indicate their status within the institute. Qualifications and training The Institute of Consulting has several qualifications available for members, and offers courses to members and non-members.

The firm's main activity is tourism, having also interests in industry and services.Pestana Group Structure It manages hotel units in three different continents: Europe, South America, and Africa. The countries it serves on those continents are [in alphabetical order]: Argentina, Brazil, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Portugal, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, and South Africa. The Pestana Group owns the Portuguese airline euroAtlantic Airways, and a stake in STP Airways, which is the national airline of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. Besides the 91 hotels, the Pestana Group has six timesharing properties, three golf courses, two real estate/touristic properties, a gambling concession for a Casino, a participation in a charter airline, a travel agency and three Tour Operators. In 2015, Pestana Group partnered with Cristiano Ronaldo to open a hotel chain under the CR7 brand. The first hotel was opened in 2016 in Funchal, above Museu CR7, later that year another hotel was opened in Lisbon. In 2020, Pestana Group opened its second hotel in the United States in Manhattan. The Pestana Group owns Empresa de Cervejas da Madeira, a company in Madeira island that produces and distributes Coral, Brisa and Laranjada, some of the top-selling local alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. History The Pestana Group was founded by Jos√© Pestana and his brother Manuel Pestana, when they acquired the Atl√¢ntico Hotel in 1965. A new five-star hotel was built in its place, the work was completed in 1972. Later Jose Pestana sold his part of the business and when Manuel Pestana retired he left control of the company to his son, Dion√≠sio Pestana.Pestana Profile In 2003, the Pestana Group took over the management of Pousadas de Portugal. Animal Abuse A guest at S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe reported that on 23rd June 2020 she witnessed two hotel workers beat a dog in full view of her and other guests. A third worker watched. The dog was severely injured, suffering a crushed pelvis and a broken leg. A local vet treated the dog which is recovering slowly. It is believed this is not an isolated incident at S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and no explanation by the hotel or the Group has ever been given.

This technique relates changes in amino acid molecules to the time elapsed since they were formed. All biological tissues contain amino acids. All amino acids except glycine (the simplest one) are optically active, having a stereocenter at their Œ±-C atom. This means that the amino acid can have two different configurations, \\"D\\" or \\"L\\" which are mirror images of each other. With a few important exceptions, living organisms keep all their amino acids in the \\"L\\" configuration. When an organism dies, control over the configuration of the amino acids ceases, and the ratio of D to L moves from a value near 0 towards an equilibrium value near 1, a process called racemization. Thus, measuring the ratio of D to L in a sample enables one to estimate how long ago the specimen died. Factors affecting racemization The rate at which racemization proceeds depends on the type of amino acid and on the average temperature, humidity, acidity (pH), and other characteristics of the enclosing matrix. Also, D/L concentration thresholds appear to occur as sudden decreases in the rate of racemization. These effects restrict amino acid chronologies to materials with known environmental histories and/or relative intercomparisons with other dating methods. Temperature and humidity histories of microenvironments are being produced at ever increasing rates as technologies advance and technologists accumulate data. These are important for amino acid dating because racemization occurs much faster in warm, wet conditions compared to cold, dry conditions. Temperate to cold region studies are much more common than tropical studies, and the steady cold of the ocean floor or the dry interior of bones and shells have contributed most to the accumulation of racemization dating data. As a rule of thumb, sites with a mean annual temperature of 30 ¬∞C have a maximum range of 200 ka and resolution of about 10 ka; sites at 10 ¬∞C have a maximum age range of ~2 m.y., and resolution generally about 20% of the age; at -10 ¬∞C the reaction has a maximum age of ~10 m.y., and a correspondingly coarser resolution. Strong acidity and mild to strong alkalinity induce greatly increased racemization rates. Generally, they are not assumed to have a great impact in the natural environment, though tephrochronological data may shed new light on this variable. The enclosing matrix is probably the most difficult variable in amino acid dating. This includes racemization rate variation among species and organs, and is affected by the depth of decomposition, porosity, and catalytic effects of local metals and minerals. Amino acids used Conventional racemization analysis tends to report a D-alloisoleucine / L-isoleucine (A/I or D/L ratio). This amino acid ratio has the advantages of being relatively easy to measure and being chronologically useful through the Quaternary. Reversed phase HPLC techniques can measure up to 9 amino acids useful in geochronology over different time scales on a single chromatogram (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, alanine, arginine, tyrosine, valine, phenylalanine, leucine).Kaufman, D.S., 2000 in Perspectives in Amino Acid and Protein Geochemistry: Oxford University Press, New York, 145-160. In recent years there have been successful efforts to examine intra-crystalline amino acids separately as they have been shown to improve results in some cases. Applications Data from the geochronological analysis of amino acid racemization has been building for thirty-five years. Archeology, stratigraphy, oceanography, paleogeography, paleobiology, and paleoclimatology have been particularly affected. Their applications include dating correlation, relative dating, sedimentation rate analysis, sediment transport studies, conservation paleobiology, taphonomy and time-averaging, sea level determinations, and thermal history reconstructions. Paleobiology and archaeology have also been strongly affected. Bone, shell, and sediment studies have contributed much to the paleontological record, including that relating to hominoids. Verification of radiocarbon and other dating techniques by amino acid racemization and vice versa has occurred. The 'filling in' of large probability ranges, such as with radiocarbon reservoir effects, has sometimes been possible. Paleopathology and dietary selection, paleozoogeography and indigineity, taxonomy and taphonomy, and DNA viability studies abound. The differentiation of cooked from uncooked bone, shell, and residue is sometimes possible. Human cultural changes and their effects on local ecologies have been assessed using this technique. The slight reduction in this repair capability during aging is important to studies of longevity and old age tissue breakdown disorders, and allows the determination of age of living animals. Amino acid racemization also has a role in tissue and protein degradation studies, particularly useful in developing museum preservation methods. These have produced models of protein adhesive and other biopolymer deteriorations and the concurrent pore system development. Forensic science can use this technique to estimate the age of a cadaver or an objet d'art to determine authenticity. Procedure Amino acid racemization analysis consists of sample preparation, isolation of the amino acid wanted, and measure of its D:L ratio. Sample preparation entails the identification, raw extraction, and separation of proteins into their constituent amino acids, typically by grinding followed by acid hydrolysis. The amino acid derivative hydrolysis product can be combined with a chiral specific fluorescent, separated by chromatography or electrophoresis, and the particular amino acid D:L ratio determined by fluorescence. Alternatively, the particular amino acid can be separated by chromatography or electrophoresis, combined with a metal cation, and the D:L ratio determined by mass spectrometry. Chromatographic and electrophoretic separation of proteins and amino acids is dependent upon molecular size, which generally corresponds to molecular weight, and to a lesser extent upon shape and charge.

The new building with is expected to open in 2010. At least 250 new jobs will be added to the local economy. David Braley contributed $10-million towards the project. Braley's donation marks an important transition in Hamilton's economy, as he takes money he made in the industrial economy and uses it to help the community develop a more diverse economic base. David Braley is the president of auto-parts manufacturer Orlick Industries Ltd., former owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and current owner of the B.C. Lions. Lakeport Brewery Lakeport Brewery In 1856, the Daniel C. Gunn Engine Shop on Wellington Street North, produced the first Canadian-built locomotives. In 1976, First Place apartments, a seniors high rise at King and Wellington opened on the site of First United Church, which burned down in 1969. Lakeport Brewing Company is based in Hamilton and focused on producing value-priced quality beer for the Ontario take-home market. Lakeport pioneered the \\"24 for $24\\" value segment. Lakeport produces nine proprietary beer brands, two of which, Lakeport Honey Lager and Lakeport Pilsener, are two of the top ten selling brands in the province of Ontario. Lakeport has more than 200 employees at its production facility. It is one of the fastest growing companies in the Hamilton region. Lakeport Brewing Company joined forces with the Hamilton Port Authority who will finance and construct a 35,000 square foot (3,250 m¬≤) expansion to Lakeport's Hamilton harbour front facility. Lakeport Brewing Company is Canada's No.1 co-packer of beer, non-alcohol and spirit-based products. The company is also said to be North America's most modernized beverage alcohol production facility. On Monday May 8, Labatt Brewing Company made it official and announced that Lakeport, who they purchased earlier in the year, (March 29, 2007), for $200-million for rights to the income trust, which controlled the plant, will continue to operate in the City of Hamilton. It will continue to operate in Hamilton as they believe it is a \\"viable plant\\" and \\"the company is proud to integrate it with Labbat's.\\" The operations employees continue to brew Lakeport in Hamilton but the marketing and sales jobs are now centralized at Labatt's head offices. Kenesky Sports on Barton & Wellington Streets is the site where Emile \\"Pops\\" Kenesky invented the hockey goalie pads in 1917. His new pads were cricket pads, modified, and widened to approximately 12 inches. The new pads caught on extremely quickly, and this style of pad was used by a majority of pro goalies right on to the 1970s. NHL greats like Johnny Bower, Jacques Plante and Terry Sawchuk having worn them. Kenesky's company became the best-known manufacturer of hockey equipment in Canada. Also a hockey school for hockey goalies of all-ages. Alumni include NHLers Ray Emery and Dwayne Roloson. Landmarks Note: Listing of Landmarks from North to South.

It inhabits areas with rocks and eelgrass at depths from . It feeds on various marine invertebrates. This species can reach in standard length. It can also be found in the aquarium trade. Symphodus ocellatus These fish live about two to three years. There are three distinct male forms. There are nesting males, sneaker males, and satellite males. The nesting males are the largest of the three and the most brightly colored. The sneaker males are the smallest of the three types and the most dull in color, and actually closely resemble the female phenotype. Satellite males are an intermediate in size and color between the large nesting male and smaller sneaker male. Nesting males court females, build and guard nests, and provide parental care for the offspring. Nests are made of harvested algae. Sneaker males do not court females, do not provide parental care and they join in when a female and nesting male are mating in an attempt to fertilize the eggs before the nesting male. Satellite males assist in courting the females, they chase away sneaker males, but they do not provide parental care for the offspring. The male types are determined in early development. If a male fish grows quickly, it will be a satellite male in its first breeding season then will become a nesting male in its second. For the slower growing males, they will be a sneaker male in their first breeding season, then a satellite male in their second. Breeding season occurs from May to June.

This cataclysm led to a great deal of incandescent material, which could explain myths such as the Apocalypse and Sodom and Gomorrah.

This thesis has been criticized by other scientists because of the absence of craters and of iridium in the pockets of land from this time. Critics have not provided adequate data showing that all impacts contain iridium and other metals such as higher proportions of nickel or other heavier metals may also be proposed alternatives for distinct proof of an impact signature.

Created by and named after communication scholar Mark L. Knapp, the model suggests that all of the steps should be done one at a time, in sequence, to make sure they are effective. However, not every relationship will go through these stages of development in the same way.Floyd, K. (2016). Interpersonal Communication (3rd ed.). McGraw- Hill Education. p. 302. Compared to DeVito's six-stage model of relational development,DeVito, J. A. (1993). Messages: Building Interpersonal Communication Skills. New York, HarperCollins Knapp's model is far more prescriptive and detailed, but also presupposes that the relationship will ultimately dissolve, as evident in the five \\"coming apart\\" stages that make up the second half of the model. However, Knapp himself has said that his model is also descriptive; the model describes what seems to happen, not necessarily what should happen. The model proposes that coming apart need not be seen as inherently bad, just as coming together need not be seen as inherently good.Knapp, M. L., Vangelisti, A. L., & Caughlin, J. P. (2014). Interpersonal Communication and Human Relationships (7th ed.). Pearson. Couple showing signs of affection The following stages are identified by the type of communication behavior that occurs in a given stage as well as the proportion of that type of communication behavior to another. In this case, proportion may constitute the frequency with which the acts occur or to the relative weight given to certain acts by those involved. Phase of coming together=Initiation Initiation is the first stage where individuals make their first impressions on each other. While a lot of important impressions are being processed, the actual initiation stage likely lasts less than 15 seconds. In this stage, individuals are trying to display their best selves. Also, we are observing the other person to learn about them and, therefore, reduce our own uncertainty. Physical appearance often plays a big role in this stage when it comes to forming first impressions. The methods and messages used to initiate communication vary based on:Knapp, M. L. (1978). Social Intercourse: From Greeting to Goodbye. Allyn and Bacon. *The kind of relationship and whether or not the individuals have been through this stage before *The time allowed for the interaction *The amount of time since the last greeting *Situational or normative constraints *Special codes of particular groups Experimentation Experimentation is the stage where individuals begin to engage in self-disclosure to learn information about each other. The individuals use this stage to explore and get a feel for the relationship as well as one another. Small talk is a common form of communication in this stage, as both parties use it to search for an area of common interest of experience. At this stage, relationships are generally pleasant, casual, and uncritical. Knapp has long emphasized that most relationships will not progress past this stage. Intensifying During the intensifying stage of Knapp's model, the two individuals will continue experimentations to determine whether there is mutual emotional affection and attachment. Whereas in the previous experimentation phase, conversation focused more on superficial topics such as discovering shared areas of interest and commonalities, in the intensifying stage the level of self-disclosure deepens. The breadth of topics discussed broadens and the depth in which each individual feels comfortable discussing those topics with the other becomes intimate and personal. In this stage, certain behaviors, such as increasing one-on-one contact through more frequent communication (through face to face encounters, text, or phone calls), doing favors for a partner or offering gifts as tokens of affection, requesting commitment from a partner through direct definitional bid, personalized verbal expressions of affection such as \\"I love you\\" or assigning pet names such as \\"babe,\\" and suggestive actions such as flirtation, gazing, or touching, may all emerge as methods of intensifying the connection between the two people. Essential to the intensifying stage are \\"secret tests\\"Baxter, L. A., & Wilmot, W. W. (1984). Secret tests. Human Communication Research, 11, 171‚Äì201. performed by each individual to ascertain whether his or her overtures are actually helpful in their intensification efforts. These tests most often manifest themselves through: * Endurance, in which a partner is placed in an unpleasant, inconvenient, or uncomfortable situation or respond to certain requests to determine his or her commitment to the relationship. * Public presentation, during which a partner is introduced under a particular label such as \\"boyfriend\\" or \\"girlfriend\\" to see if they are comfortable with being identified in this manner. * Separation, which tests whether communication and feelings of affection will continue despite an inability to physically be together. * Third-party questioning, where one partner may attempt to find out the hidden feelings of the interested party indirectly by asking a friend to probe the person of interest for indication as to their depth of feeling and affection. * Triangle tests, in which one partner sees if they can elicit jealousy from the other partner when another person expresses interest in the person concocting the test. While all five of these methods are common methods of testing intensification efforts, it's important to note that endurance, separation, and triangle tests are generally the least constructive, and can even be destructive when it comes to building the relationship. Phase of coming together and Relational Maintenance =Integration Once each individual feels confident, through their various intensification efforts, that mutual affection has been confirmed, the couple may begin to transition into the integration stage of their relationship. In addition to bonding, the integration stage makes up maintenance stage of a relationship. During this stage, the couple is fused and elements of their respective social identities, such as friends, belongings, and living spaces, are now shared. Other verbal and nonverbal manifestations of the integration include the couple seeing their relationship as special or unique in some way, the exchange of \\"trophies\\" for the other to wear or display, and potentially similarities in manner, dress, and verbal behavior can be seen. Today, another indicator of integration can be seen on social media sites where partners can be seen in each other's profile picture.Papp, L. M., Danielewicz, J., & Cayemberg, C. (2012). \\"Are we Facebook official?\\" Implications of dating partners' Facebook use and profiles for intimate relationship satisfaction. Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking, 15(2), 85‚Äì90. Additionally, the exclusive commitment each partner has for the other is generally solidified in this stage through even deeper self-disclosure and revealing of secrets, sex, and discussion of future plans. Bonding The final stage of the coming together half of the relational model is bonding. This stage puts the relationship on public display and suggests that the relationship is exclusive. This stage often involves marriage or another type of public contract, though marriage is not necessary to successfully bond. There is usually a turning point that happens in this stage that signals a change in the relationship, making the relationship intimate. Reaching this stage does not guarantee that the relationship will remain bonded, though many intimate relationships will remain in this stage until divorce, death, or another type of separation. Phase of coming apart and Relational Maintenance  Along with the coming together stages, all relationships will go through the coming apart stages of the relational development model, though some may skip steps (e.g. a sudden death terminating the relationship). Differentiating Differentiating is a process of disengaging or uncoupling. During this stage, differences between the relationship partners are emphasized and what was thought to be similarities begins to disintegrate. Instead of working together, partners quickly begin to become more individualistic in their attitudes. Conflict is a common form of communication during this stage; oftentimes, it acts as a way to test how much the other can tolerate something that may threaten the relationship. Knapp believes that differentiating can be the result of bonding too quickly; meaning, sufficient breadth and depth (see: Social penetration theory) was not established during the previous stages. However, differentiating is expected to happen in romantic relationships. A common solution to differentiating is for each partner to give the other some space, though extreme differentiating can lead to a damaged relationship. Circumscribing Circumscribing sees a qualitative and quantitative decrease in information exchange. Communication is limited to safe topics. This stage is marked by less total communication in terms of number of interactions, depth and breadth of topics discussed, and communication occurs in shorter durations. Expressions of love and commitment also decrease. Phase of coming apart =Stagnation In the stagnation stage, what were once patterns in the relationship become ruts and people feel stuck or trapped in the relationship. Communication in this stage sees partners saying very little because they \\"know\\" how the other person will respond. Individuals will engage in imagined interactions to predict a conversation with their partner.Honeycutt, J. M., & Cantrill, J. G. (2001). Cognition, Communication, and Romantic Relationships. Routledge. pp. 62‚Äì81. These imaginary dialogues can be either narratives (\\"I'll say this, and then she'll say this...\\") or perceived actual dialogues (\\"I'll do it.\\" \\"You don't have to.\\"). At this stage, there is still some hope that the relationship can be revived. However, in many cases there are too many costs accumulating and, therefore, most do not stay at this stage for long. A key reason why individuals stay in this stage is to avoid the pain associated with terminating the relationship. Avoidance While the stagnation stage sees partners continue to inhabit the same environment, the avoidance stage sees partners exist in separate physical environments. When actual avoidance cannot take place, however, partners will simply avoid each other while they're together, treating the other as if they didn't exist. Essentially, the individuals in the relationship become separate from one another physically, emotionally, and mentally. When there is communication, it is often marked by antagonism or unfriendliness (\\"I just don't want to see or talk to you\\"). In addition to not spending time with one another, they both begin to avoid the other person's needs and start to focus solely on themselves. Different forms of distancing are also common at this stage:Hess, J. A. (2002). Distance regulation in personal relationships: The development of a conceptual model and a test of representational validity. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 19, 663‚Äì683. *Avoidance: preventing or reducing interaction during an encounter *Disengagement: hiding information and interacting in a less personal manner *Cognitive dissociation: disregarding messages and showing cognitive or emotional detachment Termination During the termination stage, both people that were in the relationship decide to end their connection with one another. No longer are they both receiving a mutually satisfying outcome from being with one another. Neither one of them is happy and the relationship must come to an end. In this model, this step is unavoidable and relationships can terminate at any time. Termination can occur due to physical separation, growing socially or psychologically apart, or the death of one of the partners. Communication in this stage is marked by distance (an attempt to put psychological and physical barriers between partners) and disassociation (messages that prepare one or both parties for their life without the other). Summary of movement through the stages According to Knapp, movement through the stages has the following characteristics: #Movement is generally systematic and sequential. This does not suggest that the process is linear or unchangeable; the phenomena is never at rest and is continually in flux. People do generally follow the same pattern, however. Each stage contains important presuppositions for the next. Sequencing makes forecasting adjacent stages easier. Skipping steps is risky due to potentially losing information that would have been provided in the skipped step. #Movement may be forward. Any movement toward greater levels of intimacy is considered \\"forward.\\" When in the coming apart stages, any movement back toward a coming together stage would be a forward movement. #Movement may be backward. \\"Backward\\" movement constitutes any movement away from the bonding stage. Backward movement can be the result of moving too quickly, thus preventing any sort of stabilization. #Movement occurs within stages. #Movement is always to a new state. Partners can go through the same stages more than once, but they can never truly go back to \\"the way things were.\\" However, their previous experience in a given stage will color their next trip through said stage. In an effort to determine which stage partners are in, Welch and Rubin (2002) gave partners a list of behaviors and asked them to indicate the extent to which each behavior was characteristic of their relationship.Welch, S. A., & Rubin, R. B. (2002). Development of relationship stage measures. Communication Quarterly, 50, 24‚Äì40. Welch and Rubin also found that the relational development model was useful for describing the development of task or business relationships. Rate of movement According to Knapp, rate of movement is: #Usually rapid through stages that have already been achieved (e.g. there's no need for small talk if you've already passed through the experimenting stage before) #Usually rapid through areas where positive rewards have been achieved (e.g. avoiding conflict until later on in the relationship as it may be too costly early on) #Potentially rapid when time is short (e.g. a summer fling) #Potentially facilitated when proximity is high #Generally faster during the early stages #Based on individual needs (e.g. lonely or isolated people may move faster than popular people with large friend groups) #Slower if only one person wants to move to a different stage #Rapid in deterioration if one party commits a violation  Knapp's relational development model in the modern world[edit]  Knapp‚Äôs relational stage model was created in 1978. This was well before the way we communicate became so heavily based on technology. The stages that have been established can still be seen, but they look a lot different than they did over forty years ago. Social Media Networks allows us to broadcast and share information about out relationships much more quickly and to a much broader audience. In the first phase, the initiating phase, people tend to try to ‚Äúsize each other up‚Äù to decide whether to initiate a relationship and how to start communicating. This can be made more difficult in a virtual world where people communicate through text without ever seeing each other. In the virtual world you can be whoever you want to be and withhold information such as real name and where you are from. Even if or when photos are exchanged it is easy to send photos of someone other than yourself. This type of anonymity makes it difficult to know with whom you are really initiating a relationship. In the second stage, experimenting, the two individuals try to learn more about each other. They try to determine if they have anything in common and decide if they want to pursue a relationship. If both parties decide to go to the intensifying step, they will start to exhibit more self-disclosure and start to have verbal shortcuts and more expressions of commitment. According to Fox and Weber‚Äôs 2013 study there are six stages in the escalation of relationships involving Social Media Networks: 1) Meet the target face to face 2) They went to Facebook to look at the profile of the target and send a friend request 3) Request and exchange phone numbers 4) They begin texting and will invite the target to a group activity 5) They will begin to post on the targets Facebook wall and comment on posts 6) They would call the person and ask them on a date In the next stage, integrating, social circles start to merge, and they may exchange symbols of their relationship or own property together. If the relationship makes through the integrating stage, then it will enter the bonding stage. This stage is where their commitment will become formally announced to the world. This is usually in the form of engagement or marriage. Social networking has changed the way the steps in Knapp‚Äôs model are processed. Facebook, for example, allows one to find out details about someone you are interested in without even having to have a conversation. Romantic relationship status can easily be found through a quick search of social media. The initiation phase no longer requires taking a chance by asking directly what the relationship status is. Facebook also functions as a convenient way to pursue someone while not having to put yourself in too far out on a limb The pursuer can interact with the target by liking or commenting on posts or by tagging them on posts. Because of the lack of intimacy involved when using SNS this method is often preferred over phone calls. Using computer mediated communication also allows the pursuer the time to think about what they want to say and how they want to say it. Facebook profiles provide information about an individual, such as education level, religion, interests, as well as photos. This immediate information can influence how quickly a relationship is formed. While most relationships are initiated off-line, the participants often turn to Facebook to communicate. In Knapp‚Äôs second theme, experimenting, Facebook provides a lot of information on interests, activities, and information. This serves as a way to talk about interests that are shared as well as ways to learn about interests the other has. The final theme is making the relationship ‚ÄúFacebook Official‚Äù by sharing photos to each other‚Äôs pages as well as changing the relationship status on the profile page. This is part of the integrating phase. Social networking sites are used by over 900 million users worldwide, and the average college student uses Facebook an average of 1-2 hours per day. Men and women see romantic relationships differently and have different goals when pursuing relationships. Women are more likely to advertise their relationship through the use of social media sites than their male counterparts and tend to see displays of affection more acceptable on social media than men do. Men and women also have different views on what it means to be ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù official. Being Facebook official can mean different things to different people. Men don‚Äôt seem to feel that Facebook Official necessarily means they are in a committed relationship or at the very least as seriously as their partner does.

A former regional rail station, it was converted for light rail use and reopened on July 4, 1959, along with the rest of the line. The 1891-built station and express office are part of the Newton Railroad Stations Historic District, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. History Newton Centre station shortly after the 1907 track lowering The first station at this site opened in 1852 on Langley Road as a part of the Charles River Railroad. The Boston and Albany Railroad commissioned a building which design was started by H. H. Richardson in 1886, the year of his death, and which design was finished by Richardson‚Äôs successor firm of Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge. The new station, built by the Norcross Brothers firm of Worcester, opened in 1891. The station was heavily modified in 1907 when the line was sunk below grade to eliminate street crossings. The Highland Branch was closed in 1958 and quickly converted for light rail use. The station building was rented out as commercial space. Until 2008, it housed a Starbucks coffee shop containing a sign that indicated when a Boston-bound train arrived. However, the shop was closed in October 2008 as part of Starbucks' restructuring campaign due to the Great Recession. The Deluxe Station Diner, a satellite restaurant of the Deluxe Town Diner in Watertown, opened in the newly renovated building in December 2010. In the early 2000s, the MBTA modified key surface stops with raised platforms for accessibility as part of the Light Rail Accessibility Program. The renovation of Newton Centre was completed around 2002. Around 2006, the MBTA added a wooden mini-high platform on the inbound side, allowing level boarding on older Type 7 LRVs. These platforms were installed at eight Green Line stations in 2006‚Äì07 as part of the settlement of Joanne Daniels- Finegold, et al. v. MBTA. In October 2012, the MBTA changed the station name from Newton Center to Newton Centre to match the village name.

Club career=Shelbourne & UCD Kenna began his League of Ireland career with Shelbourne where he was a primary figure in the Reds' under 21 squad and was briefly part of their first team squad. He left Shels prior to the start of 2004 League of Ireland season to join First Division UCD for whom he helped to promotion to the Premier Division with a 2nd-place finish. His primary role was at centre back although he deputised on many occasions at left back for UCD in spite of being right footed. Kenna formed a highly successful partnership at centre back with Alan McNally in a defence that gave up the fourth fewest goals in the 2006 League of Ireland season. Kenna was called into an Irish U-21 squad in 2005 but had to withdraw through injury. He was appointed UCD captain in the 2008 pre-season to replace the retired Tony McDonnell. He scored his first competitive goal for UCD in a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Derry City on 7 March 2008. Drogheda United Following UCD's relegation to the First Division at the end of the 2008 season, Kenna signed for Drogheda United in February 2009. Kenna made 38 competitive appearances and scored 5 goals for Drogheda in 2009 as the Louth club retained their Premier Division status. St Patrick's Athletic Kenna signed for St Patrick's Athletic on 9 February 2010, linking up at the Inchicore club with his former UCD manager Pete Mahon, who selected him as club captain.http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=3453#.Un1csnm6XYU.html Kenna became a fan's favourite at Inchicore and received the St. Patrick's Athletic Supporters Club Player of the Year award in 2010. Kenna also earned the nickname 'Kennavaro' after brilliant performances similar to famous World Cup winning central defender Fabio Cannavaro. He played every minute of every game in all competitions for the Saints in 2010 and didn't get a single yellow or red card all season. It was widely speculated that Kenna would join 2010 league winners and Dublin rivals Shamrock Rovers but he stayed loyal to his club and this made him even more of a popular figure with the fans.http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=4064 2011 looked to be a promising season for the Saints but his footballing career came into doubt when he sustained an injury to a tendon in his knee in the second league game of the season against Bray Wanderers at Richmond Park on 11 March. He returned from his long injury setback in a 0‚Äì0 draw away to Sligo Rovers on 27 July, Kenna wasn't expected to return so early as he was still building up his fitness but Mahon was forced to play him due to players being tired from a tough game against FC Shakhter Karagandy and he lasted the first 68 minutes before being replaced by Brian Shortall.http://www.stpatsfc.com/report.php?report=455 Kenna went on to regain his place in the starting line up, pushing Shortall to the bench. Kenna scored in a 1‚Äì0 win over Sligo at Richmond Park in a huge match in the 2011 title run-inhttp://www.stpatsfc.com/report.php?report=464 After Kenna returned from injury his performances were just a shadow of his 2010 performances which many fans put down to finding his feet again after the long period without playing games. Indeed, they were correct as Kenna regained his excellent form in defence and the Saints found themselves with 3 clean sheets and just 2 goals conceded after the first 5 games of the 2012 season. Kenna played a big part in Pats' 2012 Europa League campaign, playing every game and setting up Stephen O'Flynn's goal against √ç√ær√≥ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja in extra-time at the H√°steinsv√∂llur, Iceland and also setting up Christy Fagan's winning goal in extra-time against NK ≈†iroki Brijeg from Bosnia and Herzegovina at Richmond Park to earn a tie against Hannover 96, whom he played against in the 49,000 seater AWD-Arena. He captained the Pats side in their first ever appearance at the Aviva Stadium in the 2012 FAI Cup Final on 4 November 2012, but unfortunately for Kenna and the Saints, they lost 3‚Äì2 after extra time to Derry City meaning the club's FAI Cup drought was extended to 52 years. Kenna continued his excellent form alongside his partner at Centre back, Kenny Browne into the 2013 season, with the captain maintaining his spot in the starting eleven and heavily contributing to what was the joint best defence in the league, with just 10 goals conceded after 20 games, as his Pats side sat top of the league. He made his 350th career appearance in a famous 4-0 win away to Shamrock Rovers in the South Dublin derby on 9 August 2013.http://extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/19223/2/ Kenna made his 100th league appearance for Pats on 16 August 2013 in a 1-0 over Shelbourne at Richmond Park.http://extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/19253/2/ On 13 October 2013, one year on from losing the 2012 title to Sligo Rovers as a result of a last minute penalty given against Kenna, he marked his 150th appearance for Pats by skippering the team to a 2-0 win at home to Sligo to clinch the 2013 League title.http://extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/19167/2/ Kenna lifted the League of Ireland trophy at Richmond Park on 20 October 2013 following a 1-1 draw with Derry City, Pats' ninth league title.http://extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/19186/2/ Kenna's last game for the Saints was in a 4‚Äì2 loss away to Cork City on the final day of the season.

Directed by Mike Nussbaum (Chicago and Broadway) and choreographed by Thommie Walsh (Broadway). In addition to Russ Thacker as Eddie and Maureen Moore as Becky, the cast included Don Stitt, Vicki Lewis and Jason Graae. Musical The 1950s era story from the original books by John R. Powers was also turned into a musical with music and lyrics by James Quinn and Alaric 'Rokko' Jans in 1979. Produced by Libby Adler Mages and Daniel Golman of Mavin Productions. The original coming of age musical involves the 1950s Catholic education of eight Chicago children, following them from the start of elementary school through the senior prom and beyond. Along the way it touches on such topics as first confessions, puppy love, patron saints, teacher's pets, sex education classes, and the importance of not wearing patent leather shoes as they could reflect up under the school uniform's plaid pleated skirts. One of the central plot elements running through the musical is that Eddie Ryan is infatuated with a chubby girl, Becky Bakowski. She becomes his best friend, and he later falls in love with her when she matures into a beautiful young woman. Unfortunately, she has decided to become a nun. Many years later Eddie returns to his old elementary school to inquire about Becky only to find she has left the order and is teaching in a small school in Indiana. At the end of the musical they are reunited. An original cast recording was released by Bay Cities Records.

At times besieged by autograph seekers for his role with the Mustang, Frey, a third generation engineer, was \\"one of the few auto executives with experience in all three of the industry's essential areas: design, manufacture and sales.\\" He had nonetheless been most proud of assisting Ford in introducing safety improvements to their lineup, including disc brakes and radial tires. In 1967, Time called Frey \\"Detroit‚Äôs sharpest idea man\\". Frey went on to a successful career as an innovator in manufacturing and information systems and as chairman and CEO Bell & Howell. In 1990, he received the National Medal of Technology in a White House ceremony. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. Background Frey was born to Edward Muir Luken and Margaret Bryden (n√©e Nelson) Frey in St. Louis, Missouri.1930 United States Federal Census. - Sheet 34A, District 7-20, Ward 2, Waterloo, Blackhawk County, Iowa. - April 26, 1930. His paternal great-grandfather, Abraham Frey, was born in Leipzig, Germany. He grew up with his younger brother Stuart M. (who later became chief engineer at Ford Motor Company after Donald) in Waterloo, Iowa, where his father worked for Deere & Company. His father, a metallurgist, designed the 1923 John Deere Model D tractor, and would later work for the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. As children, Frey and his brother had once made gunpowder -- from scratch. Frey received his diploma from Bethel High School. In 1940, he began engineering school at Michigan State College. During World War II Frey worked on the Packard V-1650 version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine for Packard Motors, the engines to be sent to England for placement in the Hurricanes and Spitfires. He then served as an officer in the United States Army (1942‚Äì1946). After the war he returned to his studies, this time at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. At Michigan's College of Engineering, he earned a bachelor of science degree in metallurgy (1947), a master's degree in systems engineering (1949), and a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering (1951). During his doctoral studies he was an assistant professor. Frey married four times, to Margaret (mother of his six children), Mary Cameron, Arvelene Gore, and last wife Kay Eberley, from whom he was separated. He died March 5, 2010 in Evanston, Illinois, at age 86, survived by three daughters, Margaret Walton, Catherine McNair, and Elizabeth Sullivan and two sons, Christopher and Donald Jr. Frey was trilingual (speaking English, Russian and French), was an avid follower of opera and archaeology, and while at Ford, read \\"the London Times Literary Supplement as avidly as Ward's Automotive Reports.\\" At the time of his death, Frey owned (and drove) a two- tone merlot and white 19641/2 Mustang. Ford and the Mustang Frey started working for Ford in 1950, managing Ford‚Äôs metallurgy department. He later was named Vice-President and Chief Engineer (1964). In addition to the many industrial innovations Frey oversaw at Ford, he supervised the prototype styling of the Ford Mustang and its later development. Frey pursued the Mustang after Henry Ford II had rejected it four times, in no small part because of the Edsel's spectacular failure. Without formal approval, Frey met clandestinely with Lee Iacocca and other engineers and designers- notably lead stylists Philip T. Clark and John Najjar to continue developing the car. Speaking to USA Today in 2004, Frey said \\"The whole project was bootlegged, there was no official approval of this thing. We had to do it on a shoestring.\\" Consequently, when Henry Ford II did approve the project, he put Frey in charge and told him he would be fired if the Mustang was not successful. Ultimately, the Mustang was a huge success, despite being engineered at one tenth the cost of the 1965 Ford Galaxie. Mike Mueller quoted Frey in his 2009 book Mustang: An American Classic as attributing the inspiration for the Mustang to GM's strategy of incrementally improving the Corvair. \\"I guess in desperation they put bucket seats in the thing, called it the Monza, and it started to sell\\". Frey was also behind the four-door Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation), the stereo dashboard tape deck, and the station wagon tailgate that swung out like a door (window up or down) as well as down like a tailgate -- marketed as the \\"Magic Doorgate\\" beginning with the 1966 Country Squire. He was later involved in the development of the Ford Bronco, and played a key role in Ford Motorsports. In 1967, he received an honorary Doctorate in Engineering from the University of Michigan. He was very concerned that the United States was losing the \\"global race\\" for automobile improvements in technology because there is little interest in investments for innovation and thus an increasing \\"gap\\" between the U.S. with Japan and Germany. Later career Frey left Ford in 1968, in part because of differences with fellow Ford executive Lee Iacocca, resigning to become president of General Cable Corporation.\\"About\\". - General Cable Corporation. - generalcable.com. - Retrieved: 2007-07-27. Environmental issues became Frey's focus, leading him to establish new copper recycling methods. In 1971, he was appointed chairman and CEO of Bell & Howell, replacing Peter G. Peterson who left to join the Nixon Administration, making \\"a sweeping transformation of a company still known for film, microfiche and microfilm, as the video era dawned.\\" Frey made several strategic acquisitions at Bell & Howell, sold off businesses (e.g., the DeVry Institute of Technology, now DeVry University), and he pioneered moves into video cassettes for movies and CD-ROM information systems in the 1970s and 1980s. He was instrumental in promoting the first successful CD-ROM-based information system, designing the dealer auto parts catalog for General Motors, by David Gump, to be distributed to dealers on CD. Next they put GM's maintenance records on CD-ROM, and then maintenance records for Mercedes-Benz, producing a computer file for every Mercedes ever made. He also became a member of the board of directors at 20th Century Fox during this time. He helped bring about the first high-volume integrated manufacture of video cassettes for the motion picture industry. Tapes had previously been made in real time, with hundreds of high school students changing out tapes, but when Bob Pfannkuch heard that DuPont started making tapes out of chromium dioxide instead of iron dioxide, Bell & Howell developed technology that could make a copy of a film in about a minute, cutting production time by over 99 percent. Frey retired from active executive industry management in 1988. Just as he was to retire Bell & Howell was bought out by the Robert M. Bass Group, headed by the wealthy Texas millionaire Robert Bass, proving serendipitous to Frey and the shareholders. With the buyout the shares in Bell & Howell stock went from $5 to $64 per share during his tenure. After Bell & Howell he became a professor and researcher at Northwestern University, in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences (IE/MS) Department. Frey served, until his death, on the board of directors for Stonewater Control Systems,Board of Directors. - Stonewater Control Systems (c/o stonewatersoftware.com). - Retrieved: 2007-07-27.

It is the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Grahamstown. The cathedral is located on Church Square and has the tallest spire in South Africa . The cathedral is dedicated to St Michael and St George and celebrates its patronal festival on the Sunday closest to Michaelmas (29 September).  History  The large ornate lectern still in use in St Michael and St George Cathedral The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel had voted ¬£500 in 1820 for the erection of a church in Cape Town, this gift was declined by the Governor, Lord Charles Somerset. However, while he was in England next year, he wrote to Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of State for War (who administered the colonies), asking him to obtain the ¬£500 for Grahamstown, where The Society very generously agreed, and voted the ¬£500 for Grahamstown, the balance of the money needed was supplied by the colonial treasury. Plans were prepared by W Jones, a land surveyor of Cape Town, and the building erected by George Gilbert also of Cape Town. Sir George Cory thus summarizes the agreement entered into by these persons, and dated 9 September 1824: It was later decided to use zinc for the roof instead of thatch at an additional cost of Rds 4,730 (¬£354 15s.). Even so, the roof caused further delays in the completion of the building, which was not opened until 1830. The new church was of course not consecrated, but it bore the name of St George's. The fragment of it that remains, the south wall, is the oldest piece of English Church architecture in the country. William Geary, the first Colonial Chaplain of Grahamstown (who was appointed and removed by Bathurst), reached the scene of his labours in February 1823. The Colonial Chaplain was frankly a member of the civil service, all collection plate moneys received were paid straight into the public treasury, and when the Chaplain needed anything, he had to apply for it through the same channel as any other civil servant. An interesting figure reached Grahamstown in 1833. This was John Heavyside, a missionary of S.P.G. in India. After doing duty at Stellenbosch and elsewhere, he was appointed acting Chaplain at Grahamstown, the appointment being made permanent in 1838. At the time of his arrival, St George's had developed so far as to have a slightly more ecclesiastical form of administration than the landdrost. This was the Church Committee, which probably came into existence at the time the building was opened. Members were appointed by the Government, on the recommendation of the committee. This method of administration was changed by the Church Ordinance of 1839 (during the governorship of Sir George Napier), which remained in force until 1891. The ordinance is an imposing document, They were to elect churchwardens out of their own number. The \\"officiating minister for the time being\\" (there is no word as to his appointment, which was still in the hands of Government) was to preside at all meetings of the vestry. The vestry took over all powers and possessions of the church committee, and was made a corporation capable of suing and being sued. In 1841 the meaning of the words \\"holding, communion\\" was queried, and the Attorney-General decided that they did not mean what they said, but that any one professing to be a churchman was a full member of the Church. Governors and colonial chaplains and landdrosts obtaining communion vessels and Royal Engineers (they inspected the building of the church) and pew-rents and church ordinances and secretaries of state for war-it is a queer, mad sort of story Robert Gray was consecrated as Bishop of Cape Town on St Peter's Day in 1847. He arrived in South Africa on 20 February 1848 and visited Grahamstown on 5 October 1848. At a meeting with the vestry of St George's the bishop explained that he could not consecrate the church as it was not yet conveyed to the see. On 7 June 1849 Another visitation followed and on 21 September 1850 he consecrated the church and churchyard. \\"The church was full, the parishioners appearing to take a deep interest in the matter.\\"  Conflict  The Diocese of Grahamstown was founded in 1853 with John Armstrong as the first bishop. During the oversight of Bishop Nathaniel Merriman when Frederick Henry Williams was dean, conflict arose between the two regarding the status of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa versus the Church of England and the validity of the appointments of bishops. Dean Williams then excluded Bishop Merriman from his cathedral. This action resulted in many court cases which Williams won. Various schemes had been discussed from time to time for the building of a more worthy cathedral, but nothing was done until 1874, when it was discovered that the original tower, in which the town clock had been placed, was in danger. Dean Williams set about the work of collecting funds and was loyally supported by the vestry. Plans were prepared for the tower and spire as part of a complete new building by Sir George Gilbert Scott, at that time the most notable leader of the Gothic revival. He made a free gift to Grahamstown of the various plans and working details and the building of the \\"Public Clock Tower\\", as it was called, was carried through by the committee without employing a contractor. The tower and spire were finished in 1878. Merriman died in 1882 and was succeeded by Allan Becher Webb, then Bishop of Bloemfontein. Webb was elected on 7 March 1883. Dean Williams would not recognise Webb as bishop either so, in November 1883, Webb set up his throne in an iron building (formerly a skating rink) on the site of the present post office to which the name of St Michael's Pro-Cathedral was given. But after Williams's death in August 1885, negotiations between the bishop and the select vestry were begun. Webb became \\"officiating minister\\" (the term used in the Church Ordinance) of St George's and officiated at the services on Christmas Day in 1885. After the reconciliation, the building was repaired and Webb began to collect funds for carrying the erection of a worthy cathedral one stage further. After attending the Lambeth Conference of 1888, he returned with ¬£3,000 collected in England. The plans for the chancel were prepared by John Oldrid Scott while William White-Cooper acted as superintending architect and designed several of the fittings. The foundation-stone was laid by Henry Loch, the Governor of the Colony, on 29 January 1890. The completed structure was consecrated by the Bishop Webb on All Saints' Day in 1893 in the presence of the Metropolitan, West Jones, and other bishops. A new nave, designed by John Oldrid Scott, was dedicated in 1912, just eight days short of the centenary of the establishment of Grahamstown. It is Victorian neo-gothic in style, with a granite and sandstone exterior, plastered interior walls with marble pillars. The building of the cathedral was finally completed in 1952 with the addition of the Lady Chapel. It can accommodate about 500 people.  Deanery  The deanery is a large Victorian house set in its own grounds adjacent to the cathedral hall. It has reception rooms and a study for the dean on the ground floor and completely private quarters above. There is an additional \\"bed-sit\\" attached which is suitable for short-term guests of the parish or the dean. The sub-deanery is a modern four-bedroom house with adequate reception rooms, a very small study, a garage and its own entrance, backing on to the deanery.  Historical controversy  The cathedral was the religious center of the community of Grahamstown. Graham's Town was originally a military outpost on the Eastern Frontier of the Cape Colony. It was founded by Colonel John Graham. The British campaign to push the amaXhosa residents from the Eastern frontier was defined by Graham's plan to use \\"A proper degree of terror.\\" A number of the battles of the Xhosa Wars were centred around Grahamstown. The cathedral became the primary location for memorials to those fallen soldiers of the conflicts between the original residents of the lands and the European settlers. Many of these memorials refer to the opposition in the battles, using terms which are no longer acceptable in the Rainbow Nation of South Africa. Today, these memorial plaques are covered as an acknowledgement of the diversity in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. Nevertheless, the early days of the Anglican church in Grahamstown demonstrates the unstable nature of the relationship between the indigenous peoples and the English Settlers and the ongoing place of reconciliation in South Africa. A quote from John Armstrong, the first bishop of Grahamstown attests to this controversial history:  Dean of Grahamstown  The Dean of Grahamstown is the incumbent of the cathedral. The dean has other duties and roles set out in the \\"Deed of Constitution and Statutes of the Chapter of the Cathedral of St Michael and St George, Grahamstown\\" which is an appendix to the acts of the Diocese of Grahamstown. The 20th and current dean is Andrew Hunter who was appointed in 2008.  Bells = History  The first ring of bells to be installed in Africa was hung in the cathedral tower in 1879. The bells, an octave cast by John Warner and Sons in London, were supplied complete with fittings and with a frame of English oak. The chancel was consecrated by Bishop Webb on 1 November 1893 and was dedicated to both St George and St Michael to mark the healing of a historic breach in the diocese. In 1902 remedial work was undertaken on the bell frame and fittings in the tower. The frame was assembled in the tower by local labour but not, apparently, in the way in which Warners had intended. Henry Carter Galpin, a local clockmaker, had been employed by the town council to install the town clock in the cathedral tower. He wished it to strike on bells other than those intended by Warners and modified the frame accordingly, placing one bell in a subsidiary frame raised above the other bells. As a result, seven of the eight bells swung in the same direction. This made the bells extremely difficult to ring and it is probable that they were only, initially, swung chimed. In 1887 it was reported that the joint of the bell frame \\"require tightening up throughout\\". In 1902 remedial work was undertaken on the bell frame and fittings and a band was in training under the tuition of a \\"Cape Town expert\\", a Mr Stephens. In 1903 the ringers were \\"Mr Lancaster (Captain), Dr Drury, Messrs G. Barnes, Charles Cory, Huntly and Walker\\". The bell frame, however, still gave trouble and ringing ceased in 1913. In 1959 \\"Mr Eardley from Stoke- on-Trent ... fitted new ropes\\" and undertook sufficient maintenance to enable four bells to be rung. In 1968 a change ringing band was formed under the tuition of Paul Spencer, who had learned to ring at Armitage Bridge in Yorkshire, and Bill Jackson, who had learned at Dalton-in-Furness in Lancashire. In 1993, supported by Rhodes University, the bells were rehung in a new steel frame donated by Koch's Cut and Supply Steel Centre of Pinetown, Durban, with new headstocks provided by Eayre and Smith (Overseas) Ltd, now part of John Taylor & Co. The frame was designed by Dr Ray Ayres with pits for ten bells and was assembled in the tower by local labour guided by Dave Webster of Eayre and Smith and by Colin Lewis. The first peal on the bells was rung on 17 December 1995, conducted by Alan Regin in 3 hours and 12 minutes: Cambridge Surprise Major. In 1997 two trebles, cast the previous year in London at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, were added to the ring. The first peal on the ten was rung on 4 April 1998, conducted by Timothy G. Pett in 3 hours 19 minutes: Cambridge Surprise Royal. By the end of 2000, five peals and 27 quarter-peals had been rung on the bells.  Bell details  Details of the bells are: {- ! scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"  Bell no  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 - ! scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"  Weight (kg)  288  319  362  376  392  500  698  781  961  1302 - ! scope=\\"row\\" align=\\"left\\"  Note  G  F  E‚ô≠  D  C  B‚ô≠  A‚ô≠  G  F  E‚ô≠ }  Bell ringing in Grahamstown today  The band presently ring call-changes and Plain Hunts on Sundays from 18:00‚Äì18:55.

Bell ringing at Hillandale  The Cathedral band also ring at Hillandale, some from Grahamstown, where there is a light-weight ring of four bells at the Monastery of the Order of the Holy Cross that was installed in 1999. Ringing there is under the direction of the Cathedral Ringing Master. By the end of July 2001, four quarter-peals had been rung at Hillandale, all by the Cathedral band.

John Sevier Home, is a state historic site in south Knox County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. The site was the home of John Sevier (1745‚Äì1815)‚Äîa Revolutionary War and frontier militia commander and later the first governor of Tennessee‚Äîfrom 1790 until his death in 1815. A cabin at the site was once believed to have been Sevier's cabin, although recent dendrochronological analyses place the cabin's construction date in the 1830s, well after Sevier had died. Along with the \\"Sevier\\" cabin, several out-buildings have been moved from elsewhere in East Tennessee and several have been reconstructed to simulate a typical pioneer farm from Sevier's time. The site also includes a pavilion and an outdoor stage. The site is managed for the Tennessee Historical Commission by the Governor John Sevier Memorial Association. Geographical setting Marble Springs is situated in a valley between a low ridge known as Brown Mountain to the north and the hills that comprise the southwest flank of Bays Mountain to the south. These two mountains are part of the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley Physiographic Province. The area is drained by Stock Creek, which empties into the Fort Loudoun Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River roughly to the west. The Marble Springs site is located just off Tennessee State Route 168 (Governor John Sevier Highway), which connects U.S. Route 129 (Alcoa Highway) to the west with U.S. Route 441 (Chapman Highway) to the east. The site is entirely within Knox County, although the Blount County line is just over to the southwest and the Sevier County line is just over to the southeast. History The Sevier cabin John Sevier arrived in Tennessee from his native Virginia in the early 1770s. He quickly earned a reputation as a competent frontier militia commander, helping the American cause at the Battle of King's Mountain (1780) and defeating the Cherokee at the Battle of Boyd's Creek (also in 1780). Sevier served as the only governor of the short-lived State of Franklin (1785‚Äì1788) and later as governor of Tennessee for six terms, 1796‚Äì1801 and 1803‚Äì1809. Sevier served as a state senator from 1809‚Äì1811 and as a U.S. Congressman from 1811 until his death.Robert Corlew, \\"John Sevier.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 4 April 2008. Sevier officially obtained the Marble Springs area in 1796, although he was living there as early as 1790 (the site was within a days' journey of Knoxville, which at the time served as capital of the Southwest Territory). He named it after springs on the property that flowed continuously throughout the year. Structures on the farm included a springhouse, corn crib, smokehouse, and several other cabins.Jessica Brogden, Maggie Stevens, Henri Grissino- Mayer, and Charles Faulkner, \\"The Dendroarchaeology of Two Log Structures at the Marble Springs Historic Site, Knox County, Tennessee - Final Report Submitted to the Tennessee Historical Commission ,\\" April 2007. p. 4. Retrieved: 4 April 2008. Sevier's children sold Marble Springs to an attorney named James Dardis in 1818. Dardis leased the property to the family of George Kirby, who was living at Marble Springs in 1840. Kirby purchased the property from the Dardis family when Dardis died in 1847. In 1941, the state of Tennessee appropriated funds to purchase and restore Marble Springs. The Tennessee Historical Commission and the John Sevier Memorial Commission oversaw the site's restoration.Carroll Van West, \\"Marble Springs.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 4 April 2008. Dendrochronological research In April 2007, the University of Tennessee conducted a dendrochronological analysis of logs in both the Sevier cabin and the Walker cabin. Researchers determined that the oldest logs in the Sevier cabin were harvested around 1835, placing its construction date well after the death of Sevier. The cabin's likely builder was George Kirby, who lived as a tenant at Marble Springs during this period. Historical structures at Marble Springs The Walker cabin Along with Sevier's cabin, several outbuildings have been added to Marble Springs to give visitors an idea of life on an 18th- century Tennessee Valley farm. In Sevier's time, numerous barns, smokehouses, and other buildings would have been scattered across the tract. 1\\\\. The John Sevier Cabin, built around 1835. It is the only structure original to the site. The cabin's dog-trot kitchen‚Äîa common sight on pioneer cabins in the region‚Äîwas a later addition. The cabin currently contains several artifacts donated by the Sevier family. 2\\\\. The Walker Cabin, built around 1828. This building was moved intact from a farm just off Walker Springs Road in Knox County. The Walker cabin is used by the site to represent a frontier tavern. The cabin's construction date was confirmed by dendrochronological analyses of its logs in 2007. 3\\\\. The McCall Smokehouse, built ca. 1850. This building was donated by the McCall family, whose farm lay a few miles south of Marble Springs. 4\\\\. The Loom House, built in 1970. This building was constructed from logs taken from an old log building on the McCall farm, and contains looms and wheels for spinning both wool and flax. Other buildings include a springhouse, a corn crib and several work areas.

It was designed in the Colonial Revival style, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is currently a private residence. The Robert Maxwell House sits on a rise, facing southeast, at the end of a long gravel drive that travels north and west from Northshore Drive, about ten miles (16 km) from downtown Knoxville, in Knox County, Tennessee. The house is in a cleared and landscaped yard, surrounding by rolling terrain that is heavily forested. An original log barn, in extreme disrepair, is located southwest of the house and is not included in this nomination due to its dilapidation. Included in the nomination is a pump house located to the southeast of the house. The yard consists of approximately . The front yard was originally landscaped and may have been tiered. Marble walkways, walls and benches are being found as the present owners have time to clear the undergrowth. Lowe's Ferry Road, now abandoned in this section, originally traveled in front of the house on its way south to the Tennessee River. Lowe's Ferry then proceeded to the south side of the river, in Blount County. The road was heavily traveled, both in Knox County on the north side of the Tennessee River and in Blount County on the south bank. However, when bridges caused the ferry to be abandoned and rail and later automobile transportation caused traffic to proceed in an east- west rather than north-south direction, this section of Lowe's Ferry Road was abandoned. These changes occurred at the end of the 19th century. Springs on the property are known as the Maxwell Springs, and have been extensively used for many years, both by Indian travelers prior to European settlement, and by later travelers in the period of early settlement in Knox County. The original part of the Robert Maxwell House is constructed with heavy timber framing, and its original construction date is unknown but assumed to be c. 1830, since heavy timber frame construction was common in Knox County at that time. The house was extensively remodeled in 1886 by a descendant of the original owners, and was substantially altered at that time. Its effective construction dates from 1886. The house now consists of three bays with a gable end roof, and is two stories in height. The rear section of the house was added in the 1886 remodeling, and is of frame construction. The house is covered with weatherboard wall covering. The house has a cross gable roof covered with v-crimp metal roof covering. On the primary (east) facade is a full length porch with four wood columns in the Doric order. A six panel cross and Bible front door is flanked by pilasters and topped with a cornice. Gable ends feature plain fascia boards with sawn wood attic vents. A front porch supported by stone piers was added c. 1920. An exterior end stone chimney is located on the west gable end, and was also probably added c. 1920. In the basement, which was dug in 1886, can be seen the remnants of a brick fireplace foundation. The windows are six over six double hung wood windows, with the upper windows on the rear addition being six over six wood casement windows. A side porch is located on the south elevation, with two round wood columns with Doric capitals. The interior of the original front section of the house retains a c. 1830 Georgian style mantel and original door and wood trim. The floors throughout the house are made of oak and typical of the 1880s, and were probably added with the 1886 remodeling. Doors throughout the original section of the interior are panel and frame doors with four panels. Casement windows were added to the rear addition in the 1920s, as were French doors. The dining room in the rear addition features a bay window with beaded wood trim, and three six over six windows. Walls throughout the home are plaster and lathe. The pump house located on the property is wood frame, and features a reversible sand filter. Four over four wood windows are now boarded over but still present. The pump house has a concrete floor that was probably added c. 1920. It is of frame construction with weatherboard siding and a gable roof with asphalt shingle roof covering. It is entered through a panel and frame door with four panels. The property where the Robert Maxwell House is located was originally settled by William Newton Maxwell's father-in-law, (Mahala Scott's father) who built the home around 1830. The exact date of settlement is not known. Springs on the property are called the Maxwell Springs, and it is known that Maxwell lived there when his son Robert Maxwell was born in 1847. The heavy timber frame house that forms the basis of the present house was substantial, and it is assumed that Maxwell was a prosperous farmer in the area. That portion of the house was probably built in the 1830s, when heavy timber frame construction was common in Knox County. Evidence of brick fireplaces and piers exists under the oldest portion of the house in the crawl space. Evidence has also been found to suggest that the heavy timber frame construction supplanted an even earlier structure in the same location. However, no record has been found to suggest who owned the property at that time, or what either the heavy timber frame or the earlier structures looked like. In the 1870 census, when his son Robert was 23, William Maxwell was still noted as head of the household. Robert Maxwell, William Maxwell's son, was born in 1847. In the 1880s he inherited the house from his father. At that time, three hundred acres surrounding the present tract were subdivided and some of the land was sold. James Maxwell made extensive changes in the structure and lived there until his death, when the house was sold to Matt Kirby. Kirby evidently made changes to the house when he bought it, and lived there for a time. Kirby was a farmer who operated a dairy farm in this area and soon rented the house to a succession of families. The only family name that survives as a renter from that time is that of Dempster. In 1966, the Robert Maxwell House was sold by Matt Kirby to Jack Stroud. Jack Stroud and his widow Hazel lived in the house for approximately twenty years before selling it to the present owners. The present owners have done extensive remodeling and restoration work, retaining the 1920s changes made to the house and preserving the extensive additions and remodeling completed in 1886. The Robert Maxwell House, with its Georgian Revival styling and setting, is significant for its architecture. As urban development proceeds rapidly in west Knox County, few houses from the 19th century are allowed to remain. The Robert Maxwell House is the most unaltered of the two or three known to remain on Northshore Drive, and is one of very few in the western part of the county. With its historical associations and setting, and its significant nineteenth- century architectural features, the Robert Maxwell House provides an increasingly rare glimpse into pre twentieth century residential architecture in this section of Knox County.

It is widely distributed in the eastern North and South Atlantic Oceans and into the southwestern Indian Ocean. It is caught for food and fishmeal in some parts of its range. Description The comber has a relatively stout body with a large head and a prominent jaw. It has two dorsal fins, the first has 11 thin spines and is joined to the second, which has 13-15 branched rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 7-8 soft rays. The caudal fin is slightly truncate in shape. The colouration of the comber varies from light brown to dark brown to an intense reddish brown. It is marked with 7 to 9 darker transverse bands along its flanks, these are broken by a longitudinal white to yellowish stripe, running from the head to the tail. There are a few yellow or orange longitudinal lines on the sides of the head. The first dorsal fin is normally folded flat against the back when the fish is in the water. The comber can reach a standard length of but fish are more common. Distribution The comber has an extensive distribution in the eastern Atlantic where it is found in the warmer waters in the south and southwest of England and off western Wales, south along the European coast, to the Straits of Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean and Black Seas. It also occur along the west coast of Africa from Morocco southwards to Angola. Combers are found around the islands of Macaronesia and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe in the Gulf of Guinea. It also occurs off the coasts of South Africa where it is found from the Cape of Good Hope to KwaZulu-Natal. Records from the Red Sea could represent Anti-Lessepsian migration from the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. However, genetic analysis proofed that the Red Sea population must have existed before the opening of the Suez Canal. Habitat and biology The comber occurs over the continental shelf and upper continental slope among rocks, Posidonia beds, and where there are substrates of sand and mud. It can be found to depths of . It is a predatory species which feeds mainly on crustaceans. Off the Canary Islands the diet varied with size, the smaller fish consuming more crabs while the larger fish ate carideans. Elsewhere their diet has been recorded as very varied and includes small and immature fish, annelids, squid and they have also been recorded scavenging on dead marine animals. The comber is a solitary and territorial species. They spawn between May and July, and are hermaphrodites, mature fish having both ovaries and testes. They are capable of being either male or female, and there are known to have been instances of self-fertilisation where fish have been unable to locate a partner for spawning. Sexual maturity is attained when the fish reaches a length of . Fisheries The comber is of low commercial value, approximately 1,000 tons are landed from European waters. It is eaten as well as being processed for fishmeal.

Blount, also a signer of the United States Constitution and a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, lived on the property with his family and ten African-American slaves. The mansion served as the de facto capitol of the Southwest Territory. In 1796, much of the Tennessee Constitution was drafted in Governor Blount's office at the mansion. Tennessee state historian John Trotwood Moore once called Blount Mansion \\"the most important historical spot in Tennessee.\\"Kent Whitworth, \\"Blount Mansion: Parking Lot or Landmark?\\" Journal of the East Tennessee Historical Society, Vol. 62 (1990), pp. 80-92. The house is a wood- frame home sheathed in wood siding, built with materials brought from North Carolina in an era when most homes in Tennessee were log cabins. The two-story central portion of the home is the oldest section. The one-story west wing is believed to have been constructed next; archaeologists suspect the west wing was originally an outbuilding, which was then moved and attached to the main house, and there is some evidence the west wing was originally the servants' quarters. The one-story east wing was the final section to be constructed, perhaps as late as 1820. Blount's office, from which he governed and conducted his business affairs, was built along with the house and is a one-story, free- standing building and had a modest front porch. By 1925, the house had deteriorated, and a local developer, B.H. Sprankle, intended to demolish it and replace it with a parking lot to serve the new Andrew Johnson Hotel, then under construction. The Blount Mansion Association was chartered the following year, and after a massive publicity campaign by Mary Boyce Temple and the Bonnie Kate Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the East Tennessee Historical Society, the Association raised enough money to purchase the house in 1930. The Blount Mansion Association has since maintained the house as a museum, and has made numerous renovations to restore the house and property to its late 18th-century appearance. In the 1960s, the mansion was designated a National Historic Landmark. Location Museum visitor center Blount Mansion occupies a lot in downtown Knoxville situated along Hill Avenue between Hill's intersection with Gay Street on the west and Hill's intersection with State Street on the east. The area rests atop an embankment overlooking the Volunteer Landing riverfront along the Tennessee River to the south. The Craighead-Jackson House, also managed by the Blount Mansion Association, is located across State Street to the east. History Blount Mansion's front facade, viewed from West Hill Avenue The United States created the Territory South of the Ohio River, usually called the \\"Southwest Territory\\", in 1790. President George Washington appointed North Carolina businessman and land speculator William Blount as the territory's first governor. Blount initially governed from Rocky Mount (in the Tri-Cities area), but began searching for a permanent capital for the territory. After Blount selected White's Fort for the site of the capital, James White, the owner of the fort and adjacent lands, and his son-in-law Charles McClung drew up a grid of 64 half-acre lots that would eventually become the city of Knoxville, and in 1791 held a lottery for parties interested in purchasing a lot. Lot 18, the future site of Blount Mansion, was originally sold to John Carter. Blount purchased the lot from Carter in 1794, although it's believed they had a verbal agreement for sale of the lot much earlier, and thus construction of Blount Mansion began sometime around March 1792 when Blount relocated to Knoxville.Stanley Folmsbee and Susan Hill Dillon, \\"Blount Mansion: Tennessee's Territorial Capitol.\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly Vol. 22, no. 1 (March 1963), pp. 106-108. While the mansion was being built, the Blount family may have lived in a cabin atop Barbara Hill, now known as \\"The Hill\\" by University of Tennessee students. Blount's reasons for building an elaborate frame house on the frontier were twofold. First, the house would act as a capitol of the Southwest Territory, and thus would need to command the respect of visiting delegations. Second, Blount wanted to fulfill a promise he made to his wife, Mary Grainger Blount, to build a home comparable to their lavish North Carolina home. The first phase of construction was completed between 1795 and 1796, although work continued until well into the 19th century. The detached kitchen was likely completed in subsequent years. Blount's friend John Chisholm built Chisholm Tavern facing State Street along the south side of the lot in 1792. Andrew Jackson and John Sevier were frequent visitors to the mansion, and early guests included botanist Andr√© Michaux and various Cherokee and Chickasaw chiefs. Blount transferred ownership of the mansion to his younger half-brother Willie Blount in 1797. Willie Blount deeded the mansion to Blount's son William Grainger Blount in 1818. The Blount family sold the mansion to the McClung family in 1825, and in 1845 Knoxville mayor Samuel B. Boyd had obtained ownership of the property. The Boyd family maintained ownership of the mansion until the early 20th century, renting it out to various private and commercial interests. The Boyds also made several additions to the mansion, including a large Victorian-style porch. Restoration and preservation The Blount Mansion's \\"cooling room\\", used for food storage. By 1925, Blount Mansion had badly deteriorated. Local developer B.H. Sprankle made plans to level the site and demolish the mansion and outbuildings to make room for a parking lot for the Andrew Johnson Hotel. In response, Mary Boyce Temple of the Bonnie Kate Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution purchased an option on the property, and the following year the Blount Mansion Association was chartered. By 1930, with the help of the DAR, the East Tennessee Historical Society, and the University of Tennessee, the BMA had raised enough money-- just over $31,000-- to purchase the mansion. The Association immediately initiated efforts to restore the house to its 18th-century condition, removing the Victorian additions and adding period furniture. In 1935 the Knoxville Garden Club assumed the maintenance of the grounds around the mansion. In 1955, the BMA received a grant from the Tennessee Historical Commission that allowed them to restore Blount's office. The kitchen was rebuilt in 1960 after archaeologists discovered its original foundation. That same year, the discovery of a \\"vault\\" in the rear of the house reignited old rumors about an early escape tunnel that supposedly passed under the Tennessee River, but an investigation by the National Park Service determined the \\"vault\\" to be a cooling room used for storage of wine and perishable foods. In subsequent years, paint analysis on the exterior and interior walls determined the walls' original color, and the walls were repainted accordingly. Archaeological excavations in 1973 and 1984 uncovered other outbuilding foundations and an assemblage of late 18th-century artifacts. An architectural analysis in the 1990s identified six phases of construction, and suggested that the mansion didn't acquire its full form until around 1815.Tara Mitchell Mielnik, Blount Mansion. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 29 July 2009. Design Blount Mansion floor plans & elevations, 1934 Blount Mansion is a frame and clapboard structure consisting of a two-story central block and one-story wings on the east and west ends. The first floor of the main structure contains a parlor, dining room and hallway with a quarter-turn staircase. The second story contains two bedrooms. The west wing contains a single bedroom. The east wing contains a drawing room, and has a basement accessible by stairs and a trap door. Chimneys are located on the east end of the main block and at the outside ends of both wings. The frame was probably built using locally cut timber, but the house's finished woodwork, paneling, flooring and weatherboarding materials were shipped from North Carolina.Horace Sheely, Jr., , 14 September 1964. Retrieved: 29 July 2009. Governor's Office Blount's office, often referred to as the Governor's Office, stands behind the west wing of the mansion. The office is a one-story frame-and-clapboard structure with a brick chimney on its south side, and a pair of sash windows with louvered blinds along the east and west walls. The interior includes wide- board paneling and a carved mantel. The mansion's kitchen had originally been a detached structure located behind the east wing. At an unknown date, this kitchen was dismantled and its materials used to construct an attached rear- wing kitchen. In 1958, archaeologists discovered the foundation of the original kitchen. The rear-wing kitchen was then dismantled and used to rebuild the detached kitchen on its original foundation behind the east wing. The kitchen has a design similar to the office.
