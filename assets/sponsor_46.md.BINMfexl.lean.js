As of the 2011 American Community Survey, New York City is home to 100,000 ethnic Koreans, with two-thirds living in the borough of Queens. On the other hand, the overall Greater New York Combined Statistical Area enumerated 218,764 Korean American residents as of the 2010 United States Census, the second-largest population of Koreans outside of Korea and the most prominent. History Mass Korean immigration to the United States began in the 1950s, with a large wave occurring over the 1960s and 1970s. Koreans historically came to the New York City area with the intention of permanently settling in the metropolitan area and establishing businesses. Originally, ethnic Koreans settled in highly urbanized neighborhoods in Manhattan and Queens, but beginning in the 1980s, wealthier Koreans began moving to suburban communities in nearby Bergen County, New Jersey across the George Washington Bridge, alongside the Hudson River--as well as to adjacent Nassau County (on Long Island) and Westchester County, both locally within New York State itself. Many ethnic Koreans moved into areas already settled by the metropolitan Japanese community. By 1988, there were about 150,000 ethnic Koreans living in the New York City area.Kunieda, p. 133. Geographic distribution Manhattan's Koreatown (맨해튼 코리아타운) is primarily a Korean business district in Midtown Manhattan, but since 2008, the district has seen an increase in Korean and European traffic as well, and the resident Korean population in the area has grown concomitantly. There was never a formal plan or agreement to create a Korean commercial district in Manhattan. However, given the high tourist traffic stemming from its proximity to the Empire State Building, Macy's Herald Square, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, the Garment District, and the Flower District, amongst other Midtown Manhattan landmarks, it was an ideal location for Korean immigrants to settle. Initiated by the opening of a Korean bookstore and a handful of restaurants in the 1980s, Koreatown sprang into being. With their success, an additional stream of Korean-owned businesses took root in the neighborhood, coinciding with increased immigration from Korea; and with rising demand for the prime location, overall property values in the area increased as well. According to the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Manhattan (co-extensive with New York County) had nearly doubled to approximately 20,000 over the decade since the 2000 Census. Although Korea Way continues to represent the heart of Koreatown, situated between Broadway, Sixth Avenue, and Fifth Avenue, Koreatown itself has been expanding further eastward from Fifth Avenue along East 32nd Street, toward Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, in the direction of Queens. Shinhan Bank America. Accessed March 6, 2018. Don's Bogam Korean restaurant. Accessed March 6, 2017. Koreatown, Manhattan has become described as the \\"Korean Times Square\\" and has emerged as the international economic outpost for the Korean chaebol. In the 1980s, a continuous stream of Korean immigrants also emerged into the Long Island Koreatown (롱 아일랜드 코리아타운), many of whom began as workers in the medical field or Korean international students who had moved to New York City to find or initiate professional or entrepreneurial positions. They established a foothold on Union Street in the Flushing neighborhood of Queens, between 35th and 41st Avenues, featuring restaurants and karaoke (noraebang) bars, grocery markets, education centers and bookstores, banking institutions, offices, consumer electronics vendors, apparel boutiques, and other commercial enterprises. In 1990, Korean-American owned shops were boycotted in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn; the boycott started by Black Nationalist, Sonny Carson, lasted for six months and became known as the Flatbush boycott. As the community grew in wealth and population and rose in socioeconomic status, Koreans expanded their presence eastward along Northern Boulevard, buying homes in more affluent and less crowded Queens neighborhoods and more recently into adjacent suburban Nassau County, bringing their businesses with them, and thereby expanding the Koreatown itself. This expansion has led to the creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Long Island Rail Road station in Murray Hill, Queens, exuding the ambience of Seoul itself. The eastward pressure to expand was also created by the inability to move westward, inhibited by the formidable presence of the enormous Flushing Chinatown (法拉盛華埠) centered on Main Street. Per the 2010 United States Census, the Korean population of Queens was 64,107, while the Korean population of Nassau County had increased by nearly two-thirds to approximately 14,000 over one decade since the 2000 Census. Korean Air and Asiana Airlines provide non-stop flights from Seoul to JFK Airport in Queens, and the Consulate-General of South Korea in Manhattan has played an important role in mediating travel to and from Korea by the Korean diaspora living in the New York metropolitan area. Korean American residents in Queens can enjoy an urban oasis at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Korean American residents also prominently utilize the Queens Library in Flushing. Other established and growing Koreatowns in the New York metropolitan area are located in nearby Bergen County, New Jersey, namely the Fort Lee Koreatown (포트 리 코리아타운) and the Palisades Park Koreatown (벼랑 공원 코리아타운). Signage in Hangul (한글) is ubiquitous in all of the Koreatowns. Education Korean language schools in the New York City region tend to have distinct educational missions and clienteles, and each school has its own distinct management. Because ethnic Koreans settling in New York City generally intend to permanently immigrate to the United States, the only Korean-oriented schools are supplementary institutions holding classes on Saturdays and Sundays.Kunieda, p. 137. Korean churches typically hold Korean language classes for a half to one hour per week during Sundays. In addition to the churches, there are non-religious operators of Korean schools. In 1988, the Consulate-General of South Korea in New York stated that about 40% of the Korean schools in the New York City area were non-religious. The first Korean schools were established by ethnic Korean churches.Kunieda, p. 136-137. Individual Korean schools The Korean School of New York was the first non-religious Korean school established in the city, opening in 1973. The founder, who remained as the school's principal academic administrator in 1988, believed that Korean language education should be separate from religion. As of 1988, this school had 205 students.Kunieda, p. 147. The Korean School of Queens originated as a church-operated school, and as of 1988, offered classes for elderly persons and children. In that year, the school had 141 enrolled students. As of 1988, the Korean School of New Jersey (뉴저지 한국학교) had 262 students, making it the largest Korean school in the New York City area, serving students living in suburbs in northern New Jersey. In 1988, the Church of Brooklyn Korean Language School had 120 students, the Broadway Korean School of New York had 97 students, the Westchester Korean School had 50 students, and the Pearl River Korean School had 36 students. In 2014, the McGoldrick Branch of the Queens Library in Flushing began holding Korean language classes.\\"Queens library launches its first Korean language school\\" (Archive). Korea Times.

Korean cuisine=Development of Koreatown, Manhattan as a Korean dining destination Approximately fifteen restaurants operate 24/7 on Korea Way in Koreatown, Manhattan (맨해튼 코리아타운). Approximately fifteen restaurants conduct business 24/7 on Korea Way in Koreatown, Manhattan. Korean restaurants in the district have had to expand or stay open around the clock to meet rising commercial rents and stay financially viable, given the growing prestige and high customer volume generated by foot traffic in Koreatown, Manhattan, and greater investment and involvement by the Korean chaebol. Historically known as a more tourist-oriented alternative to the residential and somewhat suburban Flushing and Murray Hill, Queens in the nearby Long Island Koreatown, Koreatown in Manhattan has since developed a reputation as an authentic Korean dining destination. Recognition by chefs and authenticity of Korean cuisine in Queens According to The New York Times, a \\"Kimchi Belt\\" stretches along Northern Boulevard and the Long Island Rail Road tracks, from Flushing, Queens, eastward into Nassau County, in the Long Island Koreatown. A prominent Korean food chef stated that \\"Queens is the closest you can come to authentic Korean food.\\" The Long Island Koreatown features numerous restaurants that serve both traditional and/or regional Korean cuisine. The development of this Koreatown has led to the creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Long Island Rail Road station in Murray Hill, Queens, exuding the ambience of Seoul itself. Korean Chinese cuisine is also available in the Long Island Koreatown.

The good relations were preserved during the reign of the next sultan Mehmed II who endowed members of the dynasty with mülks in the region of Plovdiv and Didymoteicho, later transformed into waqfs.Narodna, p. In 1435 Murad married Mara Branković. In the beginning Mara was warmly accepted, and Sultan Hatun who was the Sultan's favourite wife, was expelled from the court and sent to Bursa. It seems that something occurred at the Ottoman Porte between the autumn of 1435 and spring of 1436. It was during this time that Mara fell out of favour and was exiled while Sultan Hatun once again returned.Jefferson, p.105 In 1450, Sultan Hatun gave birth to a son named Hasan Çelebi.Thatcher, p.23 Thus Mehmed now had a half-brother younger than his own sons, who would be a possible rival for the throne. Second marriage Murad died in 1451, and his son Mehmed the Conqueror ascended the throne. Directly after his coronation, he went to the harem of Edirne Palace, where he received the congratulations of the all the women there, who also gave him their condolences on the death of his father. The highest-ranking of the decreased sultan's wives at the time of his death was Sultan Hatun, who fifteen months before had given birth to Murad's last son, Hasan. Succession had often been a matter of contention in the Ottoman dynasty and had led two civil wars. So Mehmed decided that in this case, he would settle the matter at once by ordering the execution of Küçük Ahmed. Sultan Hatun was in the throne room imparting to the new Sultan her grief at the loss of her husband, Mehmed dispatched Ali Bey, the son of Gazi Evrenos to the Women's quarters to drown the baby.Babinger, p.65Crowley Mehmed justified the murder of his half-brother as being accordance with the Ottoman code of fratricide, which on several occasions had been practised by his ancestors to prevent wars of succession. Mehmed later obliged Ishak Pasha, one of his father's officials and the new beylerbeyi of Anatolia, to take Sultan Hatun as his wife.FreelyThatcher, p.33Babinger, p.66 The two together had eight children, five sons named Halil Bey, Şadi Bey, Mustafa Çelebi, Piri Çelebi, and Ibrahim Bey, and three daughters named Hafsa Hatun, Fahrünnisa Hatun, and Şehzade Hatun.

The organization can broadly be classified as an advocacy group that engages in a variety of tactics to ensure rivers are accessible to those who wish to use them. This includes working on lobbying efforts at local and national levels as well as maintaining and publishing information about river conservation, statistics on river use, accident reports, and river sports safety. History The organization was founded in 1954 as the American White Water Affiliation incorporated in 1961. Upon its founding, the organizational members set to advance four principle objectives. (1) Encourage the exploration, enjoyment, and preservation of America's recreational waterways for human-powered craft. (2) Protect the wilderness character of waterways through conservation of water, forests, parks, wildlife, and related resources. (3) Promote and celebrate safety, proficiency and responsibility in all aspects of whitewater activities such as the navigation of moving water, teaching, teamwork, leadership, and equipment design, by publishing and demonstrating our support for instructional development in these and related fields. (4) Promote appreciation and respect for the value of wilderness activity and whitewater sports. In 1997, the name was shortened to American Whitewater (AW). The American Whitewater started publishing a journal in 1955. The American Whitewater Journal was considered the first whitewater magazine in the United States. Traditionally it consisted of stories, safety information, equipment information, and paddling technique instruction. In 2004 the association created a digital archive making the previous 50 years of journals available for online access. Major achievements *Wild and Scenic Rivers Act: American Whitewater contributed many of the initial concepts for protection of Wisconsin's waterways that Senator Gaylord Nelson incorporated into the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act that was passed into law in 1968. * Dam removal: American Whitewater has worked with a variety of organizations to further the cause of removing dams and restoring natural flows to riverways. * Hydropower relicensing: American Whitewater was a founding member of the Hydropower Reform Coalition, an organization that represents public interests in hydropower relicensing. * Access: In collaboration with The Access Fund, The American Canoe Association, The International Mountain Bicycling Association, and The Winter Wildlands Alliance, American Whitewater helped found the Outdoor Alliance, an advocacy organization that promotes public access to natural resources.  Advocacy  American Whitewater opposed the Water Rights Protection Act, a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands.

Illegitimate children are stigmatized for no fault of theirs; some, like T.E.Lawrence, are made to seek redemption of their mother’s status but most accept their fate like Satyakama Jabala did. In India, illegitimate children of a Hindu father do not inherit from him on intestacy but they do inherit from their mother at par with her legitimate children. Overview Hindu astrology has taken due care in handling the sensitive issue of establishing one’s parentage when it is in doubt. The text books describe several yogas that establish a new-born’s paternity, or foretell its adoption or abandonment, but which yogas are meant to be judicially applied taking into account other relevant factors; they are not to be applied word for word. Parajāta yogas highlight the affliction caused by malefic influences on the lagna, on the Chandra-lagna (Moon-sign) and the Moon, and on Jupiter, the Karaka (significator) of children and the 5th house (the Sutabhava) counted from the lagna, the Moon and Jupiter. All such yogas require careful application supported by mathematical accuracy, interpretation and reasoning, and should not be mishandled. Yoga-description Parasara in his Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra(Ch.XVI Slokas 13-14) states that a) the person born will not be the legitimate son of his father if the lord of the 5th house is in a moveable sign (in Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricorn), the Moon joins Rahu and Saturn is in the 5th house, or b) if Jupiter is in the 8th house from the Moon and the Moon is in the 8th house from the lagna both either aspected or in conjunction with malefic planets. Varahamihira in his Brihat Jataka (Ch.V.Sloka 6) states that if at the time of birth Jupiter does not aspect the lagna and the Moon or the Moon in conjunction with the Sun or the conjunction of the Moon, the Sun and a malefic planet, then the child will be illegitimate. Kalyan Verma in his Saravali(Ch.IX. Slokas 32-33) states that the child will be illegitimate if a)the lagna or the Moon are not aspected by Jupiter, b) if the conjunction of the Sun and the Moon is not aspected by Jupiter, c) if the Sun and the Moon in conjunction with a malefic planet are not aspected by Jupiter, d) if Jupiter, the Moon and the Sun are in their debilitation signs and Saturn is in the lagna and no benefic planet aspects the lagna, the Moon or Venus. Janardan Harji in his Mansagari (Ch.IV Slokas 91,92,93,96) states that birth of an illegitimate child is indicated if a) the lagna is occupied by a malefic planet and no planet aspects the lagna or b) if the birth occurs at the fag-end of the tithi, day (i.e. near Sunset), lagna, in the last navamsa of a moveable sign or c) if the Moon hemmed between Mercury and Venus does not aspect the lagna occupied by Saturn and Mars is in the 7th house or d) if the lagna is not aspected by Jupiter or Venus, and Mars and the Moon do not aspect the Sun. Bhogiraj Dwivedi cites an old maxim to the effect that an illegitimate child is born if on 4th (Chaturthi), 9th (Navami) or 14th (Chaturdashi) tithi which coincides with Sunday, Saturday or Tuesday and when the Moon is also in the 3rd pada of Uttaraphalguni, Uttarashada or Uttarabhadrapada nakshatra. Cancellation of yoga-effects Vaidyanatha Dikshita in his Jataka Parijata (Ch.III Sloka 48-55) tells us that if the Moon is in a sign owned by a benefic planet or is in vargas owned by Jupiter a legitimate child is born but not when - a) the 12th house is aspected by the Sun or b) if the Sun and the Moon are in a varga of the Sun or the Moon or c) if Jupiter does not aspect the lagna or the Moon or d) Jupiter neither occupies the lagna nor conjoins with the Moon or e) if the lagna or the Moon is not in Jupiter’s vargas which are actually words advising exercise of caution in handling yogas indicating birth of an illegitimate child. In his notes to Sloka V.6 of Brihat Jataka, the commentator, N. Chidambaram Iyer, has also cited Yavaneswara who states that if the lagna-navamsa or the navamsa occupied by the Moon is owned by Jupiter the child will not be illegitimate. And, that according to Garga the child will not be illegitimate if a) the Moon is in Sagittarius or Pisces or b) if the Moon is in conjunction with Jupiter in any other sign or c) if the Moon is in a drekkena or navamsa of Jupiter. If a Parajāta yoga is found to occur and at the same time any one of the condition mentioned by Garga, Yavaneswara and Vaidyanatha indicating legitimate birth is also met then that particular birth will not be of an illegitimate child.

The exposé of the environmental abuse led to the closure of the factory in 2001 and opened up a series of issues in India such as corporate liability, corporate accountability and corporate negligence. Mercury pollution in Kodaikanal The mercury contamination in Kodaikanal originated at a thermometer factory owned by Hindustan Unilever. Unilever acquired the thermometer factory from cosmetics maker Pond's India Ltd. Pond's moved the factory from the United States to India in 1982 after the plant owned there by its parent, Chesebrough-Pond's, had to be dismantled following increased awareness in developed countries of polluting industries. In 1987, Pond's India and the thermometer factory went to Hindustan Unilever when it acquired Cheseborough- Pond's globally. The factory imported mercury from the United States, and exported finished thermometers to markets in the United States and Europe. Around 2001, a number of workers at the factory began complaining of kidney and related ailments. Public interest groups such as Tamil Nadu Alliance Against Mercury (TNAAC) alleged that the Company had been disposing mercury waste without following proper protocols. In early 2001, public interest groups unearthed a pile of broken glass thermometers with remains of Mercury from an interior of part of the shola forest, which they suspected could have come from the company. In March, a public protest led by local workers' union and international environmental organisation Greenpeace forced the company to shut down the factory. Soon the company admitted that it did dispose of mercury contaminated waste. The company said in its 2002 annual report and its latest Sustainability Report that it did not dump glass waste contaminated with mercury on the land behind its factory, but only a quantity of 5.3 metric tonnes of glass containing 0.15% residual mercury had been sold to a scrap recycler located about three kilometers from the factory, in breach of the company procedures. Quoting a report prepared by an international environmental consultant, Unilever said there was no health effect on the workers of the factory or any impact on the environment. Reverse dumping Once the factory was shut down, public interest groups demanded the return of the remaining mercury waste to the United States for recycling, remediation of the factory site, and address of the health complaints of the workers. Local groups and workers' union under the leadership of Greenpeace, represented to the company, regulatory bodies, and the government, besides initiating legal action against the company. Greenpeace campaigner Ameer Shahul led the public affairs groups and workers collaboration in forcing the Company to collect 290 tonnes of dumped mercury waste from the shola forest and send back to the United States for recycling in 2003. This was widely hailed by the media as ‘reverse dumping’. Later Greenpeace campaigners Ameer Shahul and Navroz Mody led the groups in lobbying for remediation of the site and initiated an investigation by the Department of Atomic Energy of Government of India, which found that the free mercury level in the atmosphere of Kodaikanal was 1000 times more than what is found in normal conditions. Analysis of water, sediment and fish samples collected from Kodaikanal Lake by a team of scientists of the Department of Atomic Energy showed elevated levels of mercury four years after the stoppage of mercury emissions. A series of scientific studies have also been carried out by Governmental and non- governmental organisations to determine the extent of damage caused to the environment and to the people who were exposed to mercury in the factory. Remediation of the site Greenpeace and workers' unions continued to mount pressure on the company to take responsibility for the dumping crimes it had committed and for meddling with a pristine environment. They asked the regulatory bodies to prosecute the company. With these demands, public interest groups led by Greenpeace campaign head Shahul spooked the annual general body meeting of Hindustan Unilever in 2004. Consequently, the company began working with the regulatory body Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to remediate the soil, de-contaminate and scrap the thermometer-making equipment at the Kodaikanal site. The company appointed National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to finalise the scope for remediation, which was vehemently opposed by environmentalists. In 2006, the plant, machinery and materials used in thermometer manufacturing at the site were decontaminated and disposed of as scrap to industrial recyclers. In the following year, NEERI conducted trials at the factory for remediation of the contaminated soil on site, and recommended a remediation protocol of soil washing and thermal retorting. These were hotly contested by environmental groups under the leadership of Nityanand Jayaraman. Ultimately, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) recommended a remediation standard of up to 20 mg/kg of mercury concentration in soil, which means 95% of the samples analysed after the remediation process should be of less than 20 mg/kg. Consequently, pre-remediation work started in May 2009. Public interest groups contested the soil clean-up criteria and alleged that TNPCB is helping Unilever clean up to lower standards to cut costs. The acceptable mercury level being suggested by TNPCB is at least 20 times higher than what Unilever would have been required to do if they had caused the same contamination in the United Kingdom, where they are based. They also called for transparency and public participation in the process of deciding the levels of clean-up and in the process of clean-up. Workers' health problems After the shut down of the factory, the health specialists from Bangalore-based Community Health Centre conducted a survey among the former workers of the factory. It found that former workers of the factory had visible signs of mercury poisoning such as gum and skin allergy and related problems, 'which appeared to be due to exposure to mercury'. The company claims that comprehensive occupational safety and health systems existed at the Kodaikanal factory prior to its closure in 2001. Internal monitoring within the factory and external audits carried out by statutory authorities during the operations of the factory showed that there were no adverse health effects to the workers on account of their employment at the factory. It says there had been a comprehensive medical examination conducted by a panel of doctors using a questionnaire developed by Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of the United States Department of Labor; a study by the Certifying Surgeon from the Inspectorate of Factories; an assessment by Dr P N Viswanathan of Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR); a study by Dr Tom van Teuenbroek of TNO; and a study by IITR, formerly known as Industrial Toxicology Research Centre(ITRC) as directed by a Monitoring Committee set up by the Supreme Court of India. The company says its conclusions of its occupational health surveillance were also endorsed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH). In February 2006, a group of ex-employees of the factory approached the Madras High Court seeking directions for conducting a fresh health survey and providing economic rehabilitation. A year later, the Madras High Court constituted a five-member expert committee, with representatives from ITRC, AIIMS and NIOH to decide whether the alleged health conditions of the workers and their families were related to mercury exposure, and recommend whether there was need for a new health study. The Committee after examining the ex-workers, questioning the Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) officials and after a visit to the factory in October 2007 submitted its report suggesting that there is \\"no sufficient evidence to link the current clinical condition of the factory workers to the mercury exposure in the factory in the past\\". Accepting the report, the Madras High Court ruled out the need for any fresh health study. In the meantime, the Ministry of Labour and Employment, which is also a respondent in the case before the Madras High Court conducted a detailed study by a team comprising experts from various fields found that there is prima facie evidence to suggest that not only the workers of the factory, but even the children of the workers, have suffered because of exposure to mercury. The Ministry submitted its report to the Madras High Court in 2011. It also recommended setting up a Board to examine the extent of damage or disability suffered by workers and their children because of exposure to mercury, and based on the assessment of the Board workers can approach the Employment Compensation Commissioner to seek compensation. In March 2016, Hindustan Unilever entered into an out of court settlement with its ex-employees to provide “undisclosed” ex-gratia payment, in addition to long-term health and well-being benefits, to 511 of its former workers of the thermometer factory who were exposed to toxic mercury vapour. Accordingly, the ex-employees withdrew the 'class action litigation' before the Madras High Court and the High Court of Justice, London.

Her actions helped realize women's suffrage (briefly) in parts of her home town of Kochi city, where she is still known as \\"minken baasan\\" (\\"people's rights granny\\").  Biography  Kusunose Kita () was born in Hirooka (part of present-day Kōchi city) as the daughter of Kesamaru Gihei, a rice merchant, in 1836. At the age of 21, she married Kusunose Minoru (), a samurai living in the castle town of Kōchi (the present Tōjin-chō area) and a kendō instructor, but was widowed in 1874. Not having any children, she was the sole heir to her husband's property and became the head of the family (戸主 koshu). In spite of her status, and even though she was paying enough taxes, she could not vote in the 1878 elections, to be held for the recently established local assembly in Kōchi, as only males were allowed to do so. In the same year, therefore, she submitted a petition to the prefectural authorities, stating that she would refuse to pay taxes as long as her right to vote continued to be denied. Regulations for prefectural assemblies (府県会 fukenkai) at that time provided that suffrage be given to all men over 20 who had permanent residence in that district and were paying more than five yen land tax per year. Still, the Municipality Formation Law of July 1878 did not provide any national criteria for women's suffrage (or their exclusion thereof) as far as town and village assemblies were concerned. Protesting the fact that she was not allowed to vote because she was a woman, Kusunose refused to pay taxes, but her plea with the authorities was rejected. She then decided to take her petition national, addressing it to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. When the Osaka Daily reported on the matter on January 26, 1879, her case was brought to national attention. Although, eventually, she was excluded from participating in these elections, the Town and Village Assembly Law that was put into effect in September 1880 allowed local assemblies to establish their own regulations concerning elections. Without hesitation, the local authorities of the Kami-machi district (in present-day Kochi-city) adopted regulations that allowed women to participate, and shortly after, the neighboring village of Kodakasa (also in present-day Kochi city) followed suit. This is how, for the first time in modern Japan, active participation in elections for women was realized. Because the national government revised the above-mentioned law in 1884, however, the towns and villages were deprived of their right to enact their own election rulebook, and the right to vote was again restricted to men only. Even if short-lived, Kusunose's petitions and their outcome are considered a remarkable contribution to the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. Kusunose continued to fight for women's rights, earning herself the endearing title of \\"minken baasan\\" (民権ばあさん \\"people's rights granny\\") which lives on in Kōchi up to this day. She died in 1920, at the age of 84, during the heyday of Taishō democracy. Her grave can be found in a graveyard on Mount Hitsuzan in Kochi city.  Sources  Text of PetitionFor translation of the full text in English and analysis, see here Osaka Daily (大坂日報, Ōsaka Nippō) The newspaper article published in the Osaka Nippō on January 26, 1879, that turned her into a national celebrity ran the whole text of Kusunose's petition, followed by the prefectural authorities' rebuttal. This is the introductory part of the article: > People's worth lies in their intelligence, not their beards. The Risshisha > (Self-help Society), a political society founded in Tosa in 1874, was > holding speech meetings every Saturday. Speakers spoke mainly about the > popular rights and freedom.

The farm was operated by William Core and his descendants for nearly 150 years, from 1865 until 2011. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History William and Margaret Core, c.1903 William Core was born in Lincolnshire, England in 1842, the son of Thomas and Annie Core. His family emigrated to Canada in 1846, settling first near Hamilton, Ontario, and later in Lambton, Ontario. William Core left home when he was eighteen to work as a farmhand. He spent a year working on a farm near Detroit, then in 1861 moved to Leelanau County. In 1863, he enlisted in the First Michigan Light Artillery, and spent about a year and a half fighting in the Civil War. In 1865, after his discharge from the army, William Core returned to Leelanau County and purchased 160 acres to homestead at this site. He immediately began farming the land and constructing buildings. In 1867, William Core married Margaret McFarland, the daughter of Daniel and Elizabeth McFarland. The couple had ten children, eight of whom lived to adulthood: Perry, Arzina, Annie, Lucy, Julius, George, David, and Oscar. The ownership of the farm passed from William Core to his descendants. In 1927 the farm was purchased by William Core's granddaughter Ruby Ellen Core Dobson and her husband Harvey. They continued to own and operate the farm, save for a brief hiatus during the Great Depression when it was repossessed. However, the Dobsons struck a deal to repurchase the farm from the bank. In 1969, on Harvey's death, ownership later passed to Ruby and Harvey's son Rex Dobson. However, Rex never married and was the last of his family line. By 1999, he was concerned about protecting the farmstead from the encroachment of nearby Traverse City suburbs, and sold the development rights on 90 acres of farmland to Michigan's Farmland Preservation Program to prevent development. In 2002, he created The Rex Dobson Ruby Ellen Farm Foundation to preserve buildings, and in 2005 placed the farmstead on the National Register of Historic Places. The farmstead was also the location used to film the 2004 movie \\"Red Barn,\\" starring Ernest Borgnine. Rex Dobson died in 2011, ending 146 years of continuous family operation of the William and Margaret McFarland Core Farm. The farmstead is currently operated as a working farm, open to the public with prior arrangements. Description The William and Margaret McFarland Core Farm is sited among rolling hills, containing fields, woodlands, and orchards. The farm itself consists of 14 buildings on about 150 acres.

As a critic he wrote notable studies of Shishōsetsu as well as of the poet Kakinomoto no Hitomaro. He has been referred to as supportive of Shishōsetsu in an orthodox way. He is mainly known as \\"...the mid to late twentieth century's greatest scholar of Japanese haiku and related literature. He made a particular study of the development of the system of seasonal topics and season words, and single-handedly compiled the most reliable haikai saijiki (haikai almanacs) and kiyose (season word guides). They are all still in print today and widely used by renku as well as haiku poets. (Unlike many such books, Prof. Yamamoto's guides always indicate the parts of the seasons, an important feature for renku poets.) In Japanese scholarly publishing, senior scholars are often called upon as supervising editors over large, complex projects edited by teams of younger scholars. Among other projects, Prof. Yamamoto served in this capacity for the ground-breaking six-volume Eigo Saijiki / An English & American Literary Calendar (1968-70), which examined our literature through the lens of the Japanese season word system. He was a senior editor on the five-volume Nihon Dai Saijiki ('Japan Great Saijiki', 1981-83), an encyclopedic, fully color-illustrated work that still sets the standard for such books. He also wrote a five-volume series called Yamamoto Kenkichi Haiku Tokuhon ('The Kenkichi Yamamoto Haiku Readers'), published posthumously. The individual volumes have titles like 'What is Haiku?', 'A Haiku Commentary Saijiki', 'The Modern Haiku Poets', 'The Heart and Laws of Haikai', and 'The Haiku Environment', each exploring its subject clearly and thoroughly.\\"William J. Higginson, in: http://www.2hweb.net/haikai/renku/bios.html#KYamamoto \\"While working on the Nihon Dai Saijiki, Prof. Kenkichi Yamamoto selected 500 season words (out of the 16,000 included) as the 'Essential Season Words'. For each of these, he wrote the main entry, describing in detail their origins and histories in the tradition. Later, he collected these same season words for the Kihon Kigo 500-Sen ('The Essential Kigo--500 Selections', 1986), which has become a classic.\\"\\"Background\\", in: http://www.2hweb.net/haikai/renku/500ESWd.html This selective list, \\"The five hundred essential Japanese season words\\", translated by William J.

They have access to the collections of printed as well as online literature, tools for e-publishing of essays, study places, research results and education in information, scientific communication and how to work with references. Stockholm University Library is also a public library with over 1.4 million visitors in 2012.Kungliga bibliotekets statistik: Forskningsbiblioteken 2012: Antal fysiska besök  History  The university library dates back to 1877 when it started building up its collections of literature and magazines through donations and purchases. The collections were moved between different locations until they were accommodated in the attic of the school Norra Latin. The need for literature increased as the university grew. In 1882 more donations further extended the collection after an appeal had been made. The largest book donations were given by The Royal Library in Copenhagen and the University of Oslo in Norway. A number of libraries were opened in the city of Stockholm, such as the Socialvetenskapliga biblioteket, Juridiska biblioteket, Slaviska biblioteket and Humanistiska biblioteket. The Humanistiska biblioteket was to become a meeting point for young intellectuals into the 1960s with its location close to Stureplan. In 1971 the faculties of the university all were located to the new Campus in Frescati north of the inner city. At the same time today's university library organisation was founded. Different libraries, such as Riksdagsbiblioteket, Kungliga biblioteket and Vetenskapsakademiens bibliotek continued to be responsible for the purchase of literature throughout the 1970s. In 1978 the university library was given the responsibility of The Library of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (Kungliga vetenskapsakademins bibliotek), founded in 1739, thus giving the library access to one of Europe's largest collections of nature science, including the collections of Carl Linnaeus and Emanuel Swedenborg. The Emanuel Swedenborg Collection was selected as Memory of the Unesco World Register in 2005. Building The British-Swedish Architect Ralph Erskine was appointed to create the main library building in 1982. Situated in the University Campus Frescati, it was constructed as an extension of the existing university building Södra huset (The South House) from the 1960s by David Helldén. Erskine created a linkage between the buildings with his trademark, an arched-formed roof, at the same time creating the main entrance of the library. The facades and roof are dominated by concrete and aluminium.Hultin (2002), sida 245 The library by Erskine connects with the building Allhuset, made by Erskine in 1981. The university library was inaugurated in January 1983.

Life and career Born in 1939, Volker was educated at Toowoomba State High School and the University of Queensland. Volker's early Australian Public Service career was in the Department of Labour and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser appointed Volker as Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in 1981, with the mandate to clean up the administration of the department. In 1986, Prime Minister Bob Hawke transferred Volker to a position as Secretary the Department of Social Security (DSS). In his time at DSS, Volker had to deal with the pressures of the recession and its impact on Social Security offices, including long queues and increasing tension. Prime Minister Paul Keating announced Volker's transfer from the Department of Social Security to the Department of Employment, Education and Training in March 1993. In 1996, Volker was one of six Secretaries removed from their roles by the newly elected Howard Government. Political scientist Richard Mulgan speculates that Volker's removal was a result of Prime Minister John Howard's \\"determination to impose a new sense of direction\\" on the public service\\". After leaving the Australian Public Service, Volker stayed in the workforce and took on various senior roles in both government and non-government organisations, including as Chairman at the Government Relations Group in the national law firm Corrs Chambers Westgarth, Chair of the ACT Government's Skills Commission, and Chairman of the Defence Housing Australia Board of Directors.

Their coat of arms is basically \\"sable, au chef d'argent\\", a colour scheme that is present from the earliest Vilains in the 15th century, and is also seen in the Vilain XIIII arms, which have the \\"XIIII\\" added to it. They were descendants of the important medieval family of Vilain in Ghent; the name \\"Vilain XIIII\\" probably comes from the coat of arms of Philippe de Liedekercke, chamberlain of emperor Charles V, who had 16 quarters in his coat, the fourteenth (bottom row, second from the left) of which was the coat of Vilain. The three main branches of the family were the Princes of Issenghien (the De gand, dite Vilain branch), the Counts of Aalst (the Vilain XIIII branch), and the Counts of Guines (originally also De Gand dite Vilain, later Vander Steene). One branch lived at the Chateau of Leuth (or Leut) from 1822 until 1922, when the last of 7 daughters of Viscount Charles Vilain XIIII died. The oldest mentions of \\"Villain XIIII\\" date back to the 16th century, but its origin is unknown. Politically, they were usually part of either the Catholic parties, or the Liberal parties. The first known generations were politicians (often bailiff or mayor) in Geraardsbergen and Aalst; the family also owned the county of Wetteren until 1796, and the city coat of arms still bears the XIIII of the family. Origin of name The family name is pronounced vilain quatorze, and written 'XIIII' and not, in the conventional style, 'XIV'. There are various theories as to why this is (according to Frans van Kalken). The intention was probably to distinguish two branches of the family – according to Piet Lenders, between a younger and an older branch of the Vilains. Van Kalken says that the 'XIIII' goes back to a certain Josse Vilain, a bastard son of Philippe Vilain, when his natural father gave him 14 acres of land. The suffix thus distinguished the illegitimate from the legitimate branch of the family.Frans van Kalken (1936-1938), 'Vilain XIIII (Jean-Jacques-Philippe, vicomte)', Biographie nationale de Belgique, Brussels, dl. 26, pp. 742-743.Piet Lenders (1995), Vilain XIIII, Leuven: Davidsfonds, p. 11. Origins of family Old sources claim an origin for the family going back to the time of Emperor Otto I. Whether there is any basis for this or whether this is a mystification is unclear. The origin and tree given there are as follows (always from father to son): *Wichmannus, brother of Herimannus, both of the house of Saxe; Wichmann was created Count of Ghent in 949 by Otto I; he married Luitgarde, daughter of Arnulf I, Count of Flanders (she is said to have married Wichmann IV, count of Hamaland, so probably some confusion already exists here) *Theodoric (ca 977), count of Ghent, married Hildegarde, daughter of Dirk III, Count of Holland *Arnulf, Count of Ghent, married Lietgarde of Cleves *Adelbert of Ghent, first of the Counts of Aalst *Theodoric, Count of Ghent, circa 1018; married the daughter of the Count of Luzignan *Lambert I, died 1053-1054; he is no longer listed as Count of Ghent but as Castellan of Ghent, as are his descendants *Folcardus (died 1073), married Landrade, daughter of Balderic, Count of Leuven *Lambert II, died 1088 *Wennemar, Lord of Bornem, died 1138; married Gillette de Guines, daughter of Count Baldwin *Arnold, Count of Guines (inherited the title via his mother) *Siger of Ghent and Guines, Lord of Bornem *Siger II the Good, Lord of Bornem, Sint-Jans-Steene and Houdain; regent of Flanders (together with Jean de Neele) ca. 1210, during the reign of Joan, Countess of Flanders; died ca. 1227; married Lady Beatrix of Houdain From here on the tree seems to be confirmed by written sources *Hugues, castellan of Ghent, lord of Bornem, Sint-Jans-Steene and Houdain; married Ode de Champagne; the title of Castellan of Ghent did not go to Gauthier but to his other son, Hugues II *Gauthier de Gand, dit Vilain (supposedly the first to have that title, oldest source for this is said to date from 1254); lord of Sint-Jans-Steene, married Avezoete van Maelstede *Alexandre de Gand, dit Vilain, died ca. 1280; married Isabeau d'Axele; three children. Supposed to be mentioned as the Lord of Sint-Jans-Steene in 1262, and also lord of Kruibeke *Gauthier de Gand, dit Vilain, II, Lord of Sint-Jans-Steene, married Adelize de Tamize; died before 1306: their children all died without issue, ending this branch *Jourdain de Gand, dit Vilain, second son of Alexandre, succeeded Gauthier II after his death: mentioned in 1299 *Gauthier de Gand, dit Vilain, III, Lord of Sint-Jans-Steene and Boekhoute, married ca. 1330, died ca. 1339; he had two sons, Jean and Hector *Jean de Gand, dit Vilain, Lord of Boekhoute, and Sint-Jans-Steene, married Marie de Maelstede and afterwards Claire de Mirabelle; still alive in 1365 *Jean de Gand, dit Vilain, II, lord of Sint- Jans-Steene and the \\"4 Ambachten\\" (Hulst, Axel, Assenede and Boekhoute), Counsellor and Knight of the Count of Flanders (circa 1359-1385); married in 1359 Marguerite Brisetête; died before 1397 *Jean de Gand, dit Vilain, III, lord of Sint-Jans-Steene, Huisse and the 4 Ambachten, Knight and Chamberlain of Philips I of Burgundy; married Marguerite de Grave dit de Liedekercke, lady of Liedekercke and Rassenghien; we move to the established and accepted parts of the tree of De Gand dite Vilain here (or perhaps with a few of the ones directly before). The family were knights and lived at Temse (Tamize) at the time. *Jean de Gand dit Vilain, died 8 July 1449, Lord of Huisse/Huise/Huyse, Pamel, Leeberghe (Ledeberg), Borcht (Burcht) and Zwijndrecht, married to Goenele Raes; Branch of Hugues II, son of Hugues (from the same non- trustworthy old sources): *Hugues II, Castellan of Ghent, married ca. 1241 Marie de Gavre; died ca. 1265 *Hugues III, Castellan of Ghent, married Marie de Reux, died in or after 1303; they only had daughters *Marie, eldest daughter of Hugues III; Castellan of Ghent, Lady of Soudain and Sottenghien, married Gérard de Sottenghien; through this marriage, the Castellany of Ghent goes to the Melun family *Hector Vilain was Knight in Temse and Castellan of Rupelmonde in 1327. Whether he was the \\"Hector\\", son of Gauthier III, is unclear. He was married to Marie van Liedekercke (in or before 1331) and lived in our near Temse. *Jan Vilain was said to have been Castellan of Rupelmonde as well, and murdered there; he was also a lord of Sint-Jans-Steene; whether he was the same as Jourdain is unclear. *Philip Vilain was supposed to be a brother of Hector, and Castellan of Rupelmonde in 1337. *Henri Vilain was one of the signataries of the 1339 treaty of Peace and Alliance between the cities of Flandres, Hainaut and Brabant.

Was sent to the Vatican and some Italian kingdoms as a special emissary in 1832, a mission which was largely a failure, and which was rensponsible for Charles' move away from progressive ideas towards more reactionary and anti-democratic principles. Became governor of East Flanders in September 1834, succeeding Werner de Lamberts-Cortenbach. Remained Governor until the end of August 1836. At the end of 1835, he again became a special emissary to the Vatican and the Italian States; this mission lasted until 1839 and was a success. Due to his frequent absences, he didn't stand in the 1836 elections for MP. After the end of his mission in Italy, he again was a candidate MP for Sint-Niklaas, and became the MP from 1839 until 1848. He was the vice-president of the Chamber of Electives from 1843 until 1847. In 1848, he switched from Sint-Niklaas to Maaseik (where his family castle was located), and became MP for Maaseik from 1848 until his death in 1878. He was president of the chamber between 1855 and 1858. He was mayor of Leut from 1842 until 1878. He was a candidate for Governor of Antwerp in 1844, but didn't get the position. In 1855, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Pierre de Decker government, until the end of that cabinet in 1857. From 1870 until 1875 he was again elected President of the Chamber of Representatives, and in 1875 he received the honorary title of Minister of State. ********Emma Fredericque Elisabeth Vilain XIIII (born 1815/1816 - died 25 July 1864) married Prosper Joseph de Kerchove de Denterghem, member of the house of representatives; the Castle of Bazel went to this family; they had 8 children, their daughter Maria again marrying into the family to Stanislas Vilain XIIII ******Countess Isabelle Marie Colette Ghislaine Vilain XIIII (22 February 1755 - 4 January 1827) married viscount Theodore Jean Joseph Ghislain de Jonghe, Lord of Ardooie, Strathem and Duwaerde ******Two further children; Marie-Sophie (1757), and Charles (1759) *****Anne Vilain XIIII, married Rodriguez de Evora y Vega, lord of Moorsel ****Anne-Françoise Vilain, sister of François-Ignace; married to Michel de Crane, Lord of Wingaerde (his fourth wife!) **Marguerite Vilain married Frédéric Sanders; no issue **Anne Vilain, died 1630 (buried in the Family grave in the Saint Marin in Aalst); married Roland Sanders, mayor of Vrasene and Sint-Gillis, before 1594; they had a daughter, Jeanne Sanders **Viscount Alfred Vilain XIIII (1810-1886), younger brother of Charles Vilain XIIII, whom he succeeded as head of the family; member of the provincial council (Provincieraad) of East Flanders from 1836 until at least 1864; Senator ca. 1864; Mayor of Basel ca. 1864; married Antoinette Adelaïde d'Espiennes ***Viscount Stanislas Vilain XIIII (1838-1926), member of the provincial council of East-Flanders between 1864 and 1886, co-founder of the Agricultural Institute of the University of Leuven; married Maria de Kerchove de Denterghem (born 1838), daughter of Prosper Joseph de Kerchove de Denterghem and Emma Fredericque Elisabeth Vilain XIIII ***J.

It was one of the private national development and commercial banks licensed by Bank of Ghana, the national banking regulator.List of Licensed Commercial Banks In Ghana On August 14, 2017, the Bank of Ghana announced it had revoked its license due to insolvency during Ghana's banking crisis. The bank was then taken over by GCB Bank. The founder of the bank, William Ato Essien and three others were subsequently charged with misappropriating 100 million Ghana Cedis of the Bank's assets. History Capital Bank was founded by William Ato Essien on 29 October 2009 as a microfinance company. As the assets of the company grew, it became a Savings and Loans Company known as First Capital Plus Saving and Loans Company. In 2010 the microfinance grew its deposit base to 36.06 million cedis and total asset size of 47.18 million cedis. In 2013 First Capital Plus Bank had a deposit base of 211.11 million cedis and total assets of 286.80million cedis. At that time, the Bank of Ghana stated that FCP has a market share of 16% of the advances of savings and loans companies and 19% of the sector total assets. The Bank employed 355 and had 15 branches covering five regions. The company grew its base deposit and assets from its inception till 2013 when it applied and was awarded a provisional universal banking license in July, 2012. After the six month provisional period, the bank was given a full license on 4 December 2013 and became officially known as First Capital Plus Bank. The firm later re-branded to Capital Bank in 2015. The Central Bank of Ghana issued a press release on August 14, 2017 announcing the revocation of the license of Capital Bank due to insolvency (another bank, UT Bank also had its license revoked). The statement further mentioned that change of control of Capital Bank had been approved for another bank, the Ghana Commercial Bank. Services The bank offered mainstream banking services which include cash deposits and withdrawals, savings and loans and financial advise consultation. In 2011 it introduced a cash deposit service known as SpeedBanking. The service allowed bank customers to deposit cash into their bank accounts at their convenience through their mobile phones without physically being present in any bank branch.

This sponsorship agreement between the Bank and the Ghana Football Association was a five-year deal worth ten million dollars. The deal was hailed by Elvis Afriyie Ankrah, Minister of Youth and Sports of Ghana and was considered timely as the Ghanaian league had been without a title sponsor for over four months. The bank per the agreement will pay the Ghana Football Association two million dollars per year until 2019. The first payment of five hundred thousand dollars was made on 5 February 2014.

Long traveled by Spanish and Mexican soldiers and other early explorers, its first American travelers were likely fur trappers. The route became known to westward-bound American emigrants after it was traveled by a party of Forty-Niners led by John Coffee Hays in 1849. The Tucson Cutoff ran from Cooke's Wagon Road on the east side of the Animas Valley west through Stein's Pass to the cienega on the nearby San Simon River; through Puerto del Dado to Dos Cabezas Spring; across the Sulphur Springs Valley and Willcox Playa to Croton Springs; through Nugent's Pass; down Tres Alamos Wash to the lower crossing of the San Pedro River near Tres Alamos; and finally southwest from Tres Alamos to a waterhole on Cooke's Wagon Road on Mescal Wash (just west of modern Mescal), where it linked up again with Cooke's route to Tucson.John P.

Life and work Glòria Muñoz Pfister was born on 12 August 1949 in Barcelona, Spain. Her family was artistically inclined. She studied in Barcelona at l'Escola Superior de Belles Arts Sant Jordi, completing her art coursework in 1972. In the same year, she married Josep, whose father, painter and professor , helped her meet important members of Barcelona's exclusive art community. This opportunity, combined with her desire to explore new methods of artistic expression, influenced her to create paintings which can trace their origins to early twentieth-century art. In 1975, the year of her first solo exhibition, she founded an art education center, Taller de Dibuix i Pintura, in Barcelona. She has been a professor of painting in the University of Barcelona's Department of Fine Arts since 1985, and in 1990 she received a doctorate degree in fine arts from the same institution. In 2000, she was a member of the Madrid Ministry of Education's \\"Contemporary Realism\\" project. Art In 1980, Muñoz concentrated on painting landscapes. Her primary subject was the scenery of Empordà in northeastern Spain, but other locations in Spain (Majorca, Granada, Cap de Creus, Cadaqués, Castelló d'Empúries, El Port de la Selva, and Peralada), Italy (Tuscany), and Southern France were also depicted in her landscapes. Later in her career, she focused on different subjects. Some of her later still lifes contain an arrangement of objects and a perspective which appear more like those typical of a landscape. A convent in Peralada which had been abandoned by its Augustinian nuns became the location for Muñoz's studio when, in 1993, she acquired the convent's chapel for that purpose. This setting provided her much artistic inspiration as she depicted many of her chapel-studio's details in her paintings. In her Empty Altars series, she painted the chapel's timeworn altar. Her works in this important series, comparing full and empty, present and absent, living and dead, symbolically allude to the passage of time, and the separation between the spiritual and the worldly. The relationship between the spiritual and the physical world is a theme which may be discerned in much of her work throughout her career. Her palette often consists predominantly of blue and ochre hues. Her work primarily depicts everyday objects, but there is usually a deeper meaning than a simple portrayal of these ordinary subjects. For example, some of her favorite subjects to paint, tables, represent more than merely furniture; they are symbolic of the unique and transient nature of human life. The tables may contain various objects which allegorically relate to a person's life. These tableaus may be intended to evoke an emotional response from the viewer. For Muñoz, a table and any objects on it may represent the entire world or a reality, the many possible forms and configurations representing the vicissitudes of life. Muñoz often succeeds in meshing elements which seem to be from contrasting worlds and with different values, while still having those elements complement one another. Exhibitions and collections Starting in 1988, she has had frequent solo and group exhibitions at Barcelona's Sala Parés, one of the most prominent and highly regarded galleries in the city. Her work has also been featured in shows, both solo and group, at many other galleries in Barcelona, as well as in other cities, including Bologna, Buenos Aires, Carmel, Geneva, Girona, Hong Kong, London, Madrid, Miami, New York City, Olot, Singapore, Strasbourg, and Toulouse. In 1998, she had a solo exhibition at the Museu d'Art Modern in Tarragona, Spain, and her work is in the museum's permanent collection. She was represented in a group show at Museo de Sant Feliu de Guíxols in 2005.

The film premiered in 1997 at the Musée National d'Art Moderne (Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris); and at Catherine David's curated Documenta X(Kassel). \\"This study in pre-Sept. 11 terrorism\\" is composed of archival footage material — interspersing reportage shots, clips from science fiction films, found footage, home video and reconstituted scenes. The work is interspersed with passages from Don DeLillo's novels Mao II and White Noise, \\"providing a literary and philosophic anchor to the film\\". According to the director, \\"Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y's narrative is based on an imagined dialogue between a terrorist and a novelist where the writer contends that the terrorist has hijacked his role within society.\\" The film's opening line, taken from Mao II, introduces the skyjacker as protagonist. Interspersing fact and fiction, Grimonprez said that the use of archival footage to create \\"short-circuits in order to critique a situation\\" may be understood as a form of a Situationist Détournement. Plot Against a backdrop of a chronology of airline skyjacks, the plot of Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y centers on an imagined dialogue between a novelist and a terrorist, based on passages from Don DeLillo's novels Mao II and White Noise. As the plot progresses, it becomes clear that with the increasing media coverage of terrorist hijacks, this power of producing an inward societal shock has been wrestled from the writer by the terrorist. They are 'playing a zero-sum game' where “what the terrorists gain, novelists lose!” We hear Mouna Abdel-Majid of the PLO tell a reporter, \\"you westerners, you don't understand ... we have to fight outside our territory and we have to bring the hope to understand our case.\\" The act of writing/terrorizing occupies the central paradox of democracy; it is the irreconcilable tension between the individual and mass culture. Throughout much of Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y, this mass culture becomes synonymous with pop music and the ubiquity of television, particularly its news coverage. As this image-saturated society amplifies throughout the 1960s and 70s, it becomes apparent by the 1980s that the hijackers' political message has been itself hijacked by the media. Whereas in the 1960s hijackers were portrayed as romantic revolutionaries, by the 1990s these have been replaced on television sets by anonymous bombs in suitcases. According to Alexander Provan, \\"The end of the film seems to suggest that the media is now the ultimate author of fictions that transform themselves into events as they're broadcast.\\" Correlating with a steep rise of the level of violence used, this depersonalization of the terrorist is merely the accommodation of terrorist spectacle for political gain. Themes= History of Hijacking  The guiding visual thread through Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y is an almost exhaustive chronology of airplane hijackings in the world. From Raffaele Minichiello, the first transatlantic hijacker (1969), to an anonymous and dying terrorist in St. Petersburg (1993), Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y charts a history of airplane hijacking, and illustrates how, as hijackers got progressively more television coverage, they became more and more deadly. In this sense, the underlying theme is that the hijack was becoming itself hijacked by news media corporations. Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y suggests that hijackers and television evolved a deadly symbiosis: on the one hand, with their protracted duration, hijackings allowed for enough time to the television cameras to be set up. The nature of live television allowed for a minute-by-minute update of the hijack as the situation progressed; this blurred the line between entertainment and tragedy. Television coverage stressed the extraordinary nature of the unfolding events (first transatlantic hijack, first live TV broadcast of a hijack, first attack on a skyjacked plane, etc.) as the only material suitable for television. On the other hand, for terrorists seeking to inscribe their struggle in history, the hijack devoid of the mediatized image of itself lost all of its communicative power. With the airplane always on the move between countries and borders as if belonging nowhere, the hijack came to symbolize the transgression across a violent border towards a political utopia. Inflight Inflight Magazine, a companion reader to Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y, is a parody based on the safety instructions pamphlets and glossy airline magazines provided for the passenger's edification and entertainment. It functions as an artistic manual for hijackers, equipped with such essentials as a safety instruction card and a barf bag. It includes excerpts from William S. Burroughs (FORE!); Leila Khaled (\\"Weapons Gave Me Words\\") Bernie Rhodes (\\"These Ears of Crime\\"), Tim McGirk (Wired For Warfare) and Richard Thieme ('Beep' Theory), Jodi Dean ('No place like home') among others. Critical reception Roberta Smith described the film as \\"exceptional for its juice and its stomach churning power\\". \\"A Holiday From History\\", an essay by Slavoj Zizek was published in conjunction with the DVD release of the film with contributions by Don DeLillo, Hans Ulrich Obrist and Vrääth Öhner.

He is the founder of International Central Gospel Church headquartered in Accra, Ghana. He is also the founder and Chancellor of Central University College, and CEO of Otabil and Associates, an executive and Leadership Growth Consultancy. He currently oversees the International Central Gospel churches, which has a network of local assemblies in Ghana, Europe, the United States, Canada and other parts of Africa. He also serves as the senior pastor of Christ Temple, a ministry of the International Central Gospel Church. His work has centered on issues relevant to Africa, although he has spoken internationally at various conferences and churches. Personal life Mensa Anamua Otabil was born on 31 August 1959 to Dinah and Lloyd Otabil who lived on Asafo Street in Sekondi-Takoradi, in the Western Region of Ghana. He was the 4th born and the 3rd son in a family of 5 comprising 4 boys and a girl (Effie, Kojo, Ekow, Mensa and Kofi). He married his wife, Joy, in 1986 and they currently have four children: Sompa, Nhyira, Yoofi and Baaba Aseda. In his early years, his family moved to Baka-ekyir,(Sekondi-Takoradi) where he attended Anglican Primary School near Gyandu Park, Sekondi. He later enrolled in Class 2 at the Community 2 No.3 Primary & Middle School (now Mexico School) in January 1966. This was when his family moved to Tema as a result of his father's promotion to Personnel Manager at GIHOC Boat yard in Tema. After passing his Common Entrance Exams, Otabil gained admission to Swedru Secondary School (SWESCO) in 1972 and completed his Ordinary Level Studies in 1977. While in Tema, he worshipped with his mother at St. Alban's Anglican Church, Tema Community 1, and later followed her to the Assemblies of God Church in Tema Community 4. Otabil was a member of Power House Fellowship in Tema. His mother died in 1975, and his father in 1976. In the late 1970s, he moved to Roman Ridge and later to Kanda in Accra where he joined the Kanda fellowship. Around that time, he also gained employment with the Audio Visual Department of the Ministry of Information. It was there that he met and worked with Edwin Donkor, who was later to become a pastor at ICGC. On 26 February 1984, he started the International Central Gospel Church ministry at the Kanda Cluster of Schools, and later moved to Sal Valley School, also in the Kanda area. He currently serves as General Overseer of the Church and Senior Pastor of Christ Temple, Abossey Okai in Accra. Otabil has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees for his work in various fields. He was also a recipient of a Millennium Excellence Award. In 2007, he was honored by the Government of Ghana with a state award, Order of the Volta (Religion).  Awards and Recognition  In March 2018, Otabil, with Kofi Annan and Martin Amidu made it to the list of 100 Most Reputable Africans. The list also featured individuals from diverse sectors including: Leadership, Entertainment, Advocacy, Education and Business. In 2015, Ghanaians voted him as the \\"Most Influential Person in Ghana\\", according to a list published by ETV Ghana. He was, in 2013, considered the twenty fourth most influential Ghanaian, in a poll run by ETV Ghana.  Television and Radio  Otabil presents a radio and television program called Living Word where he addresses life issues such as religion, education, economic development, family life, and politics. The program has been broadcast by several radio and television networks in Ghana. The show also runs on Matthew Ashimolowo's network KICC-TV, which reaches homes across Europe and into North Africa and parts of the Middle East.  Politics and social views  Otabil has been cited on numerous Ghanaian news media for his pragmatic views on governance and Africa as a whole. He has been accused for being politically biased and affiliated to NPP (a political party in Ghana). In March 2018, former president, John Dramani Mahama launched a similar subtle jab on Otabil. The claims have been denied by officials of the New patriotic party (NPP) and former president John Agyekum Kuffour who believes Mensa Otabil is not a politician, but rather a pragmatist who likes to talk about the realities of the day. Capital Bank Saga Otabil was Chairman of collapsed Ghanaian Bank, Capital Bank (Ghana). Otabil is said to have led the receival of inappropriate money grants from the Bank on behalf of parties related to him which contributed to the collapse. Sections of Ghanaians have called for sanctioning of Directors of the Bank found to have played a lead role in its collapse. However in December 2018, Otabil filed his defence against a suit initiated by Vish Ashiagbor and Eric Nana Nipah of PricewaterhouseCoopers, who are receivers of the defunct Capital Bank (Ghana). The Plaintiffs, Messrs Vish Ashiagbor and Eric Nana Nipah from PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the bank’s collapse was a “direct result of defendants’ “misgovernance” and “wilful” breaches of banking regulations. Pastor Otabil in his defence filed at the court said that the board he chaired did not make any misrepresentation to the Bank of Ghana as regards the payment of the minimum capital required for the granting of the requisite banking license - which was one of issues in the suit against him and other directors. Pastor Otabil also explained in his defense that the debt of a total of GHȼ482 million found on the books of Capital Bank (Ghana) did not result from the negligence of the directors. He said it was the result of the plaintiff having identified various outstanding or impaired legacy assets traceable to the microfinance days of First Capital Plus which later became Capital Bank (Ghana).

Life He commenced his plastic arts’ education at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw in the year 1904, where at first he had his tuition under Stanisław Lentz and Karol Tichy. As a result of taking part in a youth manifestation against the Tsar’s rule in 1905 he was obliged to give up further studies in Warsaw. He continued his artistic study in Kraków between 1905-1910. He studied painting under the direction of (among others) the following artists painters, Stanisław Dębicki. Józef Mehoffer, Jan Stanisławski, Józef Unierzyski and Stanisław Wyspiański and sculpture under Konstanty Laszczka.The lexicon of the Polish artists and foreign – active in Poland (died before 1966), edited by Jolanta Maurin-Białostocka and Janusz Derwojed, vol. 4 Wrocław 1986, p. 78-80 L.

He undertook these journeys in the company of Jan Wałach, with whom he had become acquainted during his student days. Wałach, who came from Istebna in the Silesia-Cieszyn region, later became known as a graphics artist, draftsman and also painter and sculptor. In 1913 Ludwik Konarzewski Sr. painted the interior of the Orthodox Church in Rozdół, near Stryj, from where he made frequent plein-air excursion to Czarnochora in the East Carpathians, where – after pattern of a few Polish painters – Sichulski, Pautsch or Jarocki – he made a painter’s record of the Hucul culture.ibid., p. 103 After his marriage in 1914 to Jadwiga Wałach (the sister of Jan Wałach) he went to pay a visit to his father, at the time the organist in Kamieńczyk, on the river Bug. They were there when the first World War broke out. Konarzewski together with his wife, was interned deep inside the Russian empire, in the village of Gratschovka about 50 kilometers from Buzuluk a town in Orenburg Oblast. He spent his time in pedagogic and cultural activities among the families of Polish and Lithuanian exiles and their children. In 1918 he moved to the nearest township – Buzułuk, where he taught history and drawing in the local school spending his spare time painting. He exhibited his works in Buzułuk, some of them were also shown in a collected exhibition in Moscow.ibid., p. 104 At the beginning of 1920 Konarzewski returned to Poland. He stayed first of all in Lublin, then – after a brief period in Warsaw – in the summer of 1920 he settled to Ustroń, in the Silesia-Cieszyn region. But in 1923 he moved to what was to be his final home in Istebna. He not only devoted himself to his creative work but also took up organizational and educational activities in the community. He started a school of Plastic Arts, which in the course of time grew to be a workshop executing sacred and other interiors, then he built a guest house which became transformed into a vigorous cultural summer-holiday centre. At the outbreak of World War II he escaped with his family to the Eastern part of Poland, but at the end of September, after the Soviet’s invasion from the East, he came back to Kraków. In 1940 he made an unsuccessful attempt to escape to Hungary. In the end he spent the whole time of the German occupation in Kraków. In 1945 he opened a workshop in Katowice in Silesia and in the same year initiated a course for sculpture in coal in Rydułtowy,The State Artistic School in Rydułtowy is named after him near Rybnik, and then in 1948 he returned for good to Istebna, where in temporary conditions (his pre-war property was virtually entirely destroyed and plundered) he revived his workshops and the school of plastic arts. Throughout his whole life Ludwik Konarzewski-senior devoted himself simultaneously to painting and sculpture, made stained glass windows and compositions and also applied art artifacts. In all these fields of his endeavour a mélange of influences can be seen, primarily the aesthetic ideas of Young Poland (Młoda Polska),A notion (Polish) that functions in the history of culture, in the sphere of the plastic arts close in meaning to Art Nouveau but also other, sometimes extreme trends in European culture. His creative art has particularly original values in the context of the region where it arose.

The main campus for the Papua New Guinea University of Technology is located 1 kilometre to the South of Tent City.  Location  Tent City is located 9 km North of Lae on Independence Drive up the road from the University of Technology and to the North East of East Taraka.  History of Tent City  Between December 1983 and July 1992, Lae experienced two major flood and mudslide disasters. In both cases, hundreds of people lost their homes. The 1983 floods remain the worst since the establishment of the town in the late 1920s. These floods left hundreds of people homeless particularly those living along the banks of the Bumbu River. Many houses were damaged or completely destroyed and hundreds of people at the Five Mile settlement along the Highland highway were also affected by mud-slides.1996 KAITILLA, S & YAMBUI, A Intervention in PNG: The Case of Lae, Disaster Management and Government Meanwhile, provincial and national leaders met to find solutions to the problem of how to resettle people displaced by the disaster and to the north of the city a block of land was allocated, planned and developed for the resettlement of the disaster victims. This 'Tensiti' settlement was developed in 1992 on the former Serafini plantation with sealed road networks, water and electricity  Housing  In May 1992, a study examined migrant settlement in and around Lae examining Tent Siti and West Taraka.TAJIMA, Yasuhiro 1992, New Migrant settlement in Lae,Traditional Social Systems and Their Transformation accessed 3 February 2014 :''Tent Siti :Tensiti is situated in the northern part of the city and was first formed by people from Menyamya, Morobe Province in 1983. Now this settlement is composed of 30 households from Menyamya, 17 households from the Highlands areas, and 11 households from the Sepik areas. People live on government land and many of them work as wage earners. Examples of their occupations include a provincial officer, an employee of a private company, and a teacher. In addition, some of them are farmers in the city.'' :''West Taraka :West Taraka is situated in the north-western part of the city, and Boundary Road is situated in the mid-western part of the city. Both have grown rapidly in the 1970's and 1980's by people coming mainly from the Highlands areas.'' The study found that almost half of the informants (48.5%) came to Lae in the 1980s. The figure is much higher in Mouth Markham (66.7%). East Sepik Province (30.3%) and the provinces in the Highlands (30.3%) stand out as places where the informants lived before they came to Lae. This tendency corresponds to the fact that most respondents were born in the Sepik and Highlands areas and less than half of them have had former migration experiences. In 2011 another study on housing was conducted drawing on the 1973 - 1974 urban household survey which revealed that less than 40% of the urban households had built and owned the houses they lived in. Five years after the establishment of the National Housing Corporation (NHC), another urban household survey revealed that only 10% of all houses in Lae were either rented or leased directly and the corresponding figure for Port Moresby was 23% Another study by the Bank of Papua New Guinea examined the demand for urban housing finance which found that two factors discouraged individual investment in urban home-ownership in Papua New Guinea. Firstly the rental housing market in Papua New Guinea was, and still is, heavily subsidised by the government and associated with paying rates, taxes and other regular repair and maintenance costs. Secondly most Papua New Guineans held strong ties with their rural areas and many people were unprepared to sever these ties for several reasons, for instance, fear of being accused by wantoks (relatives and friends) of running away from rural obligations. Public housing in Papua New Guinea is not only unavailable, but also unattainable for a large proportion (60.0%) of the urban population. It is evident that even the 1981 housing policy that encouraged national home-ownership schemes has not significantly increased home-ownership.

ITC stimulates international cooperation on research projects relevant to a scientifically and ethically sound use of tests. ITC develops guidelines on the use of tests; holds a biennial international conference; publishes a peer-reviewed journal (International Journal of Testing) and a newsletter (Testing International). History of ITC The founding of the ITC was due to the efforts of Jean Cardinet (Switzerland), who presented his concerns with the ethical use of psychological tests to the General Assembly of the Swiss Psychological Society in 1968. In 1971, the Swiss Professional Association of Applied Psychology published a set of regulations to promote the quality and prevent the abuse of tests. Cardinet initiated a project to create national Test Commissions in all countries using psychological tests.Commission Suisse des Tests. (1971). Règlement de la commission suisse des tests visant à promouvoir la qualité des tests psychologiques et à prévenir leur utilisation abusive [Changes to the Swiss Test Commission to promote the quality and prevent the abuse of psychological tests]. Revue Suisse de Psychologie, 30, 340–349. His idea was approved by the International Association of Applied Psychology (IAAP) in 1971; and by 1974, at least 15 national test commissions existed. In 1975, an advisory Council of the emerging ITC met to draft a constitution and agree on first initiatives, including a public survey of test attitudes. The ITC was officially “born” in 1976, during the Congress of the International Union of Psychological Sciences (IUPsyS), where its constitution was provisionally approved. The draft Constitution defined two membership categories: (a) full members, consisting of national test commissions recognized by the psychological association in their respective country, and (b) affiliate members, who were either international associations with an interest in testing, or national associations from countries not full members of the ITC2. The membership structure was amended several times: first in 1998, when affiliate membership was opened to any organization interested in testing (including test publishers or universities, who had not been accepted previously), and then in 2000, when the individual membership category was created. Today, the ITC membership covers most of the European Countries and North America, as well as some countries in the Middle and Far East, South America and Africa1. Initiatives of ITC=International Journal of Testing The International Journal of Testing (IJT) is the official journal of the ITC published since 1999 by Routledge (now Taylor & Francis Group). There are four issues per year. The IJT publishes original articles discussing theoretical issues, methodological approaches, and empirical research in the area of tests and testing.International Journal of Testing: Publication of the International Test Commission. http://www.psypress.com/journals/details/1530-5058/ Best Practice Guidelines Having no policy enforcement powers for the standards in psychological testing at national levels, the ITC promotes good practice in test construction and use through the development of best practice guidelines.

The carácter of his Works  The Giant Mobile Sculptures that appear in the street theatre works of Miguel Angel Martin Bordera, are original creations, of big dimensions. Due to their realism, they seem to be alive. They are articulated and mobility gifted reaching 12m of height. Their realistic character makes them surprising and they represent animals like a horse, an eagle or fantastic characters. The scenography where his creations are performed are own made and they are put to the service of the work so that the visual experience is complete. The characterization of the characters, the costumes, the body make-up, that includes latex worked, are combined for adding to the different artistic disciplines that integrates the performances a fantastic emotional and expressive strength.  Latest creations = Natural Spirit  Natural Spirit in his great version, is one of the master pieces where the giant sculptures of Carros de Foc, Royal Horse, Eagle Sophia and the biggest puppet in the world named Salvador with 38 inches height. These three sculptures are the conductive trio that introduces us into the show to put in value the concept of Natural Spirit. The aim is to make us reflect on the aggression of mankind towards the nature, the need to reach a well-deserved respect towards the environment. The intention is to form a balance that bring sustainability between man and nature. Many ways are used to express and demonstrate this: music, lights, high flying acrobatics using fabrics, rhythmic dancers using fire, acrobats, interpretation and video. Different formats merge with different scenes each representing one of the earth's element; fire, air and water, interacting at the same time with the giant sculptures of “ Salvador”, “ Águila Sophía” or “Caballo Real”. This is undoubtedly a show of great visual impact, that it does not stop surprising where ever it goes in the world like in Spain, France, Portugal, Morocco, Romania, Italy....  La Crida, Valencia  The Magic Box of Letters  The play is to reflect the basic values of the humanity. The protagonist is a young girl named Euterpe, created with the purpose of talking about the forgotten values, seeing beyond and touching upon the internal lethargic feelings of humanity. The show is divided into three parts. The first part is the presentation of Euterpe, where she describes her human and industrial condition. At the same time of Euterpe presentation, a creation of a vertical choreography symbolizes the great risk that is to live in today's modern society. The second part, Euterpe makes a tribute to the father figure as a creator and by extension to all the creators. The father figure is symbolize through the character that performs an acrobatic mid air spectacular. . Through this six meter high aerial acrobatic choreography, the staging is done. What it will mean for the creator to be side by side with his daughter to support her unconditionally through her life. In the scene with which the stage play ends there is a reflection about the strength of the letters that creates words and how to use them properly, depending how they are being pronounced. Euterpe invites us to continuously use kind words that open doors. This scene is performed with the elevation of the puppet levitating into the air above the square, creating a sublime visual scene. During this scene four vertical dancers perched on the side stairs and stage space, to visually enhance this scene, symbolizing the industrial humanization. Any good spectacle goes behind hours of essay and this one is a clear example. A metal framework was created as a performance area, in this stage play for the vertical choreography, posing new challenges in the artwork design by Miguel Ángel Martín the company artistic director. This choreography was a novelty among Carros de Foc. It showed the innovation and complexity necessary, meaning, many extra hours of work and rehearsals to accomplish the desired results needed to create the magic  References in TV  *Miguel Ángel Martín en Canal 9 *Miguel Ángel Martín en TV1 *Miguel Ángel Martín en TVN Chile *Miguel Ángel Martín en Antena 3 *Miguel Ángel Martín en Directo.

It originally aired on February 4, 2010. The episode was written by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec and directed by Marcos Siega. Plot In 1864, Katherine (Nina Dobrev) stops a horse-drawn carriage and asks for help because her husband has been attacked. A man is laying on the road and one of the two men from the carriage goes to help him. Katherine attacks the one who left at the carriage and then the other one. Her \\"husband\\" gets up and it is revealed to be Damon (Ian Somerhalder) who is still human and Katherine teaches him how a vampire acts. In the present day, Damon enters Stefan's (Paul Wesley) room without caring he is with Elena. He wants to start looking for the Grimoire and Stefan promised to help him, which for him means Elena is also helping. He asks her to find Jonathan Gilbert's journal that is the key to where the Grimoire is. Anna (Malese Jow) calls Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) trying to arrange a date with him while Ben (Sean Faris) is getting ready for his date with Bonnie (Kat Graham) later. Meanwhile, at the Gilbert house, Elena and Stefan talk about Damon as Elena is looking for Jonathan's journal. Jeremy shows up and tells them that he gave the journal to Alaric (Matt Davis). In 1864, Damon is with Katherine when Emily (Bianca Lawson) gets into the room and announces to Katherine that Pearl (Kelly Hu) is here to see her. Katherine meets Pearl, who tells her that she worries with the fact that she is with both Salvatore brothers and them knowing their vampire secret. She gives Katherine an elixir made of vervain and informs her that people start to drink it because they suspect about the vampires. Pearl wants to move to another town but Katherine's not ready. While they are talking, Pearl's daughter passes by and it's revealed that is no other than Anna. Stefan and Damon's dad, Giuseppe (James Remar), is a vampire hunter and promises his fellow hunters that both of his boys will help them. He later talks to his sons about their plan and he asks for their help. When their father walks away, Stefan says that if they talk to him about Katherine, they will convince him not to kill her. Damon does not believe that and he makes Stefan promise that he will not tell a thing. Stefan, despite his promise, tries to talk to his father denying though that he knows any vampires, but his father figures out that he is lying and spikes his drink with vervain. Later, Stefan is with Katherine who tries to feed on him but because of the vervain, she faints. Giuseppe gets into the room and asks Stefan to call the sheriff. Stefan tries to change his dad's mind but he cannot. They take Katherine away to burn her with the other vampires. Back in the present day, Alaric reads Jonathan's journal at school, while Anna is watching him. Alaric hears something and calls to see if anyone is there. When he does not get any response, he goes to his locker and gets a gun that shoots wooden stakes. He returns to the classroom and finds Stefan there. He shoots him, but Stefan catches the stake before it hits him. Alaric tries to reload but Stefan stops him and gets the gun. Stefan asks Alaric to sit so they can talk and promises he will not hurt him and he gives Alaric his gun back. Alaric is confused but he trusts him and he tells him why he is in Mystic Falls. He admits that he witnessed a vampire, Damon, killing his wife but Damon had to hear him and he disappeared along with his wife's body. Stefan tells him that if he is here for revenge it will not end good for him and he offers to help him. He asks where the journal is and Alaric points the desk where he left it but the journal is not there anymore. Anna got the journal and now she reads it to find where the Grimoire is while Ben leaves for his date with Bonnie. Later, Ben tries to fish info from Bonnie about Elena and unsuspected Bonnie tells him that the two of them are like sisters and that she would die for her. Bonnie, decides to give it a chance and she kisses Ben. The moment she does, though, she senses evil and pulls back. She acts as nothing happened and tells him that she needs to go to the bathroom. Ben realizes that Bonnie is suspecting him so he follows her to the bathroom and kidnaps her. In the meantime, Damon is at Elena's house cooking and talking with Jenna (Sara Canning) while Stefan is with Alaric. Elena is surprised to see him there. Jenna leaves them alone and Damon asks Elena straight if he can trust Stefan, something that Elena reassures him that he can. The night continues with Damon and Jeremy playing video games and Jeremy telling him about Anna. Stefan arrives, also surprised to see Damon there, and tells them what happened and that someone else took the journal. In the question who else knew about it, Damon interrogates Jeremy who admits that Anna also showed interest in it. Damon leaves with Jeremy to find Anna. Anna arrives and Damon sees her from afar, recognizing her as Pearl's daughter. While Damon is off to track Anna, Stefan tells Elena that he has a copy of the journal from Alaric. They start reading it and Elena finds a mention of Stefan's father in it. They cannot find though any mention of where the Grimoire might be and Stefan remembers a conversation he had with his father and realizes where the Grimoire is; buried with his father. The two of them go to Giuseppe's tomb and start digging it up. Damon follows Anna at the Grill's restroom and attacks her but she fights him back and they both give up. Anna tells him she was wondering how long it would take him to find her and they go to her motel to talk. She tells Damon that the key to open the tomb is hidden in his dad's journal and asks for his help. Damon takes the journal for himself and walks away telling her that he works alone. Elena and Stefan find the Grimoire but Damon shows up. Damon looks hurt but also mad over their betrayal, especially Elena's who promised him that he could trust Stefan and he believed her. Damon asks for the journal otherwise he will kill Elena. Stefan knows that he would never do that but then, unexpectedly, Damon grabs Elena and forces her to drink his blood. He would not kill her but he could turn her into a vampire without hesitation. Stefan knows that he would do that and gives him the journal while he walks away with a terrified Elena. Damon gets the journal and flashes back to the night he lost Katherine. He tried to stop his father but his father tells him that anyone who sides with the vampires will also get killed. Stefan finds Damon and promises to help him save Katherine but Damon is so mad at him and he accuses him that it is his fault. At the last flashback, we see that Pearl in her attempt to run away runs into Jonathan Gilbert whose watchpoints to her indicating she is a vampire. Pearl is shot and captured while her daughter Anna is watching with Emily. Emily promises Anna she will see her mother again. Stefan also sees Emily with Anna hiding but he does not say a word to the hunters. Back at the Gilbert house, Elena asks Stefan to bring her an aspirin and he goes downstairs to ask Jenna for one. Jenna tells him that Jeremy's friend Anna is in the house. Stefan, in a quick flashback to the night when Katherine was captured, he remembers Pearl's daughter and realizes who is Anna. He runs upstairs to Elena's room but Elena is gone.

Retrieved 15 November 2013 Background He is the son of a Welsh Methodist minister,The Times House of Commons, 1950 Rev. John Hughes, and Keturah Hughes. He was educated at Newtown and Towyn County School, the Liverpool Institute and Manchester Grammar School. In 1942 he became a Methodist local preacher. In 1957 he married Margaret Vera Herbert of Brisbane, Queensland. They had two sons.

Political career While at University he became involved in politics as a supporter of the Liberal party. In 1948 he served as President of Cambridge University Liberal Club. He was also Chairman of the Union of University Liberal Societies.The Times House of Commons, 1955 In 1950 at the age of 26, he was Liberal candidate for the Denbigh Division at the 1950 General Election. This was one of the Liberal party's most promising seats. His main opponent, Garner Evans, had been his predecessor as Liberal candidate in 1945. Despite achieving a swing of 4.7%, it was not enough for him to win; Parliament for Wales In 1950 Hughes was a founding member of Undeb Cymru Fydd an all-party organisation that was created to campaign for a Parliament for Wales. Apart from Hughes, the organisation had support from many other leading Welsh Liberals such as Emrys Roberts and Megan Lloyd George who served as the organisation's President. The campaign strategy involved the collection of a nationwide petition to present to the British parliament. The campaign also involved the holding of public meetings at which Hughes was a regular platform speaker. He was critical of how the organisation was created without any full-time staff and of the way the campaign was launched. Although the petition was signed by 250,000 people he did not think that this truly reflected the degree of support in Wales for their own parliament and believed that a referendum on the issue in the 1950s would have been lost. The overwhelming majority of Welsh MPs in the 1950s were Labour Party members who opposed the campaign. When the petition was presented to parliament before the 1955 General Election there was also a debate on the issue of creating a Welsh Parliament that was also backed by Liberal Party Leader Clement Davies. However, due to the combined votes of Conservative and Labour MPs, the bill was defeated.A Radical Life by Mervyn Jones (1991) He continued his involvement with Undeb Cymru Fydd, serving as its chairman from 1968–70.'HUGHES, Glyn Tegai', Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2013 ; online edn, Dec 2013 accessed 5 Feb 2014 He did not contest the 1951 General Election as he was working in Switzerland at the time.\\"Shock For Liberals in North Wales\\", The Times, 23 October 1951, p. 7.

In Hughes absence, not only had Garner Evans managed to increase his majority, but the Liberals had slipped to third place. Despite starting from third place, Hughes managed to increase the Liberal vote and re-establish the party as the main challenger again; He served as Chairman of the Liberal Party of Wales.The Times House of Commons, 1959 In 1959 he stood as Liberal candidate for the third and final time. During the campaign he was one of the Liberal Party's featured leaders, along with Robin Day and John Arlott in the televised Party Election Broadcast shown on 22 September 1959,The Illustrated London News, 3 October 1959 speaking predominantly in Welsh to a predominantly English speaking audience. However, his hopes of finally gaining the seat were dashed by the intervention of a Plaid Cymru candidate who split the Welsh nationalist vote; In 1967 he became a Member of the Welsh Arts Council, serving until 1976.

It stars Olivia Cooke, Daren Kagasoff, Douglas Smith, and Bianca A. Santos as teenagers who have unleashed spirits from a Ouija board. Ouija was released on October 24, 2014, by Universal Pictures. The film was a commercial success, grossing $103.6 million worldwide over a $5 million budget, but was overwhelmingly criticized by critics, with many criticizing its inconsistent tone, characters and story, but praise for Shaye's performance. A prequel, Ouija: Origin of Evil, was released in 2016, and was far better critically received. Plot Debbie Galardi recalls playing Ouija with her best friend Laine Morris as children. In the present day, Debbie throws her Ouija board into the fire, burning it. Debbie implies to Laine that something strange happened with the Ouija board. After Laine leaves, the Ouija board reappears in Debbie's bedroom. Debbie becomes possessed and hangs herself with Christmas lights inside her home. Laine attends Debbie's wake with her boyfriend Trevor, younger sister Sarah, friend Isabelle, and Debbie's boyfriend Pete. The five friends meet at Debbie's house and use her Ouija board to try communicating with her. Strange things happen, and a presence smashes Pete's hand and face into a mirror. Later, the friends start finding the phrase \\"hi friend\\" (a message communicated during the Ouija board session) written in different places, like Isabelle's car window, a tunnel wall, Pete's desk, and Laine's computer. Thinking Deb is trying to communicate with them, the group has another Ouija session. They then discover that they are actually in contact not with Debbie but with a spirit calling itself \\"DZ.\\" Laine sees the image of a little girl with her mouth sewn shut. The girl warns them to run because her mother is coming. Laine sees an old woman, and everyone flees. Laine later learns that Deb found the Ouija board in her attic and played alone. Isabelle is possessed and killed by being smashed into her bathroom sink and cracking her skull open. Laine and Pete search Deb's attic and find a box of old photographs that belonged to the previous residents. While researching the previous family's history, they learn of a little girl named Doris Zander who went missing, and whose mother was suspected in her disappearance. Laine visits Doris' sister, an old woman named Paulina, who is now committed to a psychiatric hospital. Paulina explains that her mother was a medium and used Doris as a vessel for the dead to speak through. Their mother went mad and sewed Doris' mouth shut before killing her. She tells Laine that there is a secret room in the house where Laine must find Doris' hidden body and unstitch her mouth in order for the girl to banish their mother. The remaining friends go back to the Galardi house, where Laine finds Doris' corpse and cuts the stitches on her mouth. Doris' mother's spirit protests, but Doris' spirit appears and chases away the ghost of her mother. Pete becomes possessed and is killed in his home, appearing as a soulless ghost with his mouth stitched up. Laine revisits Paulina and realizes that the old woman, revealing that she was in allegiance with Doris, intentionally lied. Doris was the evil entity all along and her mother was trying to stop the friends from summoning her.The prequel film Ouija: Origin of Evil reveals that the spirit inhabiting the body of Doris is actually that of a Policeman named Marcus. The Morris's grandmother, Nona, advises the sisters to destroy Doris' body and the Ouija board at the same time. Doris' ghost throws Trevor into a swimming pool covered with a plastic canopy, trapping and drowning him. Laine and Sarah return to the Galardi house cellar, where Doris captures Sarah and prepares to sew her mouth shut. Laine plays the Ouija board alone to draw the spirit's attention. Doris starts possessing Laine, but Deb's ghost appears to help Laine defeat Doris. Sarah throws Doris' body into the furnace, and Laine throws the Ouija board, stopping the paranormal activity. Later, Laine finds that the planchette has mysteriously appeared back at her home in her bedroom. She holds it up to her eye to look inside as the screen fades to black.

Filming Principal photography began mid December 2013 in Los Angeles wrapped at the end of January 2014 Although shooting officially wrapped in January 2014, poor test screenings resulted in re-shoots occurring in June, which, according to Olivia Cooke, resulted in half the film being re-shot. With the reshoots, Lin Shaye was added to the film to play a newly written character, Erin Moriarty's character was removed from the film entirely, and new plot points were added or changed entirely. The most notable of changes included the character of Doris Zander's physical appearance changing from that of a burnt looking girl to a rotting, decomposing girl with stitches in her mouth.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a \\"C\\" grade. Home media Ouija was released in the US on DVD and Blu-ray on February 3, 2015.http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/6964/ouija Novelization The film was novelized by Katharine Turner. The novel was released on September 16, 2014. The plot of the novel differs from the movie in many notable ways, containing an additional flashback sequence at the beginning of the book which occurs two months before Debbie dies, giving a more in-depth backstory to the main characters. Laine's father has a larger role in the novel, snapping at Sarah after she tries to sneak out of the house. There is an additional scene in the novel after the group uses the Ouija board for a second time where Sarah and Laine have a heartfelt conversation at the dinner table. There are longer sequences with Laine's grandmother Nona as well. The message \\"Hi friend\\" from Doris in the novel appears as \\"Hi frend\\". When Isabelle approaches her car after work, instead of finding \\"Hi friend\\" written in the condensation on the inside of her car, she finds a hand print. The characters of Pete and Isabelle also die in different ways in the novel. Pete, after seeing Doris' spirit in his room and becoming possessed, slits his wrists with an X-ACTO knife. Isabelle, after being possessed by Doris, sits in her bathtub with a plugged-in hair dryer, electrocuting herself. The finale of the novel differs greatly from the film. Sarah is not trapped in the altar room with Doris' spirit as in the film, but rather Laine crawls down the passageway into the altar to get Doris' body. While Laine is in the passageway, Sarah is left by the furnace with the Ouija board where Doris manipulates Sarah's arm and has it twist in unnatural positions while touching the planchette. Doris uses Sarah's arm to spell out \\"D-I-E-F-R-E-N-D\\" on the board. After throwing Doris' body into the furnace with the Ouija board, Doris appears in spirit form as a normal girl, where her mother joins her. The two hold hands and disappear. Laine suddenly notices Debbie's spirit in the room. She says \\"Hi friend\\" to Laine. Laine asks if she is dead, but Debbie tells her everything is okay. Debbie says goodbye to Laine, and Laine falls unconscious. The epilogue to the novel mirrors the film, with Laine finding the planchette in her room. Prequel Throughout January 2015, reports of a sequel were announced. In February 2015, it was confirmed the film was in development and had no release date. Jason Blum stated \\"We're a ways away ...\\" In April 2015, it was announced that the sequel would be released on October 21, 2016. Mike Flanagan would direct and co-write the sequel with his Oculus co-writer Jeff Howard. The film would be produced by Michael Bay, Brad Fuller, Andrew Form, Jason Blum, Brian Goldner, and Stephen Davis. Annalise Basso and Kaylee Procter would star in the sequel. It was then announced that Ouija: Origin of Evil would serve as a prequel to the first film. It was released in October 2016, and unlike its predecessor, it gained far more positive reviews.

Background After its eastward flight from Chengzhou (modern-day Xi'an) to Luoyi (modern-day Luoyang), the Zhou kings retained some of their prestige but no longer had the power to assert its will over the regional vassal lords. The state of Zheng had been one of the key protectors of the Zhou court in Luoyang, moving its capital eastwards as well to Xinzheng (modern-day Zhengzhou) and serving as a buffer state to the east. During the rule of Duke Zhuang, Zheng grew strong and began to assert its independence, allying with Lu and Qi and conquering other small vassals in the Central Plains. Since Zheng was in close proximity to the Zhou court, these actions increased tension between the two powers. Despite being the nominal overlord, King Ping of Zhou exchanged hostages with Duke Zhuang in an attempt to secure peace, but this only led to increased mistrust. When King Huan succeeded to the throne, he then removed Duke Zhuang from the post of court minister (卿士). In retaliation, Duke Zhuang refused to pay tribute to the Zhou court. Battle In 707 BC, King Huan finally determined to lead a punitive expedition against Zheng. The Zhou court had weakened to the extent that it required a coalition to produce the required army, gathering several other Central Plains feudal states against their common enemy. He took personal command of the central; the troops of Cai and Wey occupied the right wing, while the troops of Chen occupied the left wing. Duke Zhuang's advisor, Ziyuan, offered the analysis that the troops of Chen were in disarray due to civil war, while the troops of Cai and Wey had been defeated by Zheng before and feared them; he therefore suggested attacking the wings first, before enveloping the Zhou centre. Duke Zhuang took this advice, and the plan succeeded; the allied troops were quickly routed on the wings, and the Zhou army was destroyed by a pincer attack, with King Huan being shot by an arrow in the shoulder. Aftermath The wounding of the Son of Heaven, and the failure of a royal expedition, destroyed any remaining prestige the Zhou court once had over its vassals. The Battle of Xuge confirmed the de facto independence of the feudal states and laid the foundation for the struggles towards hegemony. Zhou was so impoverished by the defeat that, after the death of King Huan in 697 BC, it took ten years to get the funds required to hold a fitting royal funeral. The ascendancy of the State of Zheng did not last for long. Duke Zhuang died in 701 BC, and his sons fought a two-decade civil war over the throne, weakening the state permanently.

It is the terminal station on the Lunderskov–Esbjerg line and the Esbjerg–Struer line. The train services from the station are operated by DSB and Arriva, and the station serves destinations including Copenhagen, Aarhus and Ribe. The station was opened in 1874, and the present building, designed by Heinrich Wenck, was completed in 1904. With its three-storey towers flanking the central gable, it reflects a mixture of Historicist styles, some inspired by Dutch Renaissance architecture. History The first railway station in Esbjerg was inaugurated in October 1874 on Exnersgade. It was the terminus of the West Jutland line (Jyske Vestbane) from Struer to Esbjerg and of the South Jutland line (Jyske Sydbane) from Lunderskov near Kolding to Esbjerg, both being built from 1872 to 1875. Opposite the first station, a number of houses were completed in the 1890s. In 1904, Wenck's new station was opened on Jernbanegade. Architecture Esbjerg station Wenck's two-storey red-brick building with a slate roof has two striking towers, three storeys high, on either side of the recessed entrance. Influenced by international trends, it reflects various Historicist styles. The entrance hall with its timbered finish is reminiscent of Tyrolean designs. The building is in excellent condition following recent restoration. Heinrich Wenck who was employed by the national railway company had completed a number of station buildings, often working with his predecessor N.P.C. Holsøe, before he designed Esbjerg station in 1902. He was influenced by the rich, National Romantic style of Martin Nyrop which drew on stately Dutch Renaissance decorations and details. Features include a central gabled section with a large lunette window flanked by twin towers. At the time, lunettes were widely used for illuminating station halls. The tall symmetrical complex has hipped roofs with smaller towers at each end. The building was completed the same year as Copenhagen Central Station with which it bears similarities. Destinations Esbjerg station Esbjerg station currently serves destinations including Copenhagen, Aarhus, Ribe, Skjern and Niebüll in Germany. Both DSB and Arriva make use of Esbjerg station.

The British defensive strategy in Gibraltar predominantly focused on keeping enemies at a distance through the use of artillery. There were few inner lines of defence to address the risk of an enemy getting through the outer line. However, the southern tip of Gibraltar, Europa Point, was long felt to be potentially vulnerable to a surprise attack from the sea and was heavily fortified with gun batteries, perimeter walls and scarped cliffs. In 1841, Major General Sir John Thomas Jones KCB recommended in a report on Gibraltar's fortifications that provision should be made for close defence of the batteries at Europa Point, which he identified as a possible invasion route. He recommended that \\"all barracks should be either bombproof or fireproof, and to a certain extent defensible.\\" To that end, he designed a defensible barracks block which could be used both as a place of relaxation and as a fortification. Its front was pierced with loopholes to facilitate rifle fire, while the walled courtyard at the rear was protected by caponiers projecting out from each wall. The walls themselves were also pierced with loopholes. The building was capable of withstanding small arms fire and a direct assault, but was still vulnerable to a naval bombardment. It was strengthened some years later by the construction of a New Defensible or Bombproof Barracks, built on the curtain wall between 1st Europa Right Flank and Woodford's Left Flank. The new barracks stood between the existing Defensible Barracks and the sea, with its massive stone wall providing shelter for the accommodation casemates.

It was established in the 1960s as a self-help club dedicated to promoting Oromo self-identity and providing basic infrastructures like school, health facilities, roads and water supplies to the Oromo people. But since political parties were not allowed at the time, associations such as Mecha-Tulama often took on political roles. The organization attempted to involve Oromos in both cities and the countryside. It was most successful in the south, Arsi in particular, where Oromos had been relegated to the status of tenants on Ethiopian territory and land that they had invaded and occupied since the 16th-century Oromo migration from northern Kenya and southern Somalia. At the height of its development, Mecha-Tulama claimed as many as 300,000 members. The leadership comprised educated Oromos who had been Amharized but subsequently rediscovered their culture, deciding to fight for a fair share of the spoils of modernization.http://www.angelfire.com/alt2/gada-koo0/HISTORY.htm The most prominent leader of Mecha-Tulama was Tadesse Birru, a former general in the Ethiopian police force and the territorial army. He was from a Shoan Oromo family and had established himself firmly in Amhara culture. In fact, his Oromo origins were not apparent to many until he began to champion the cause of his people. Tadesse Birru appeared at organizational rallies in southern towns, delivering speeches critical of the government's policies towards Oromo areas and encouraging the people to demand justice. He carefully linked his appeal to the dignity of Oromo culture, a culture that, he emphasized, was being destroyed at the hands of Amhara. By November 1966 the Haile Selassie regime became sufficiently alarmed at growth in the movement's popularity and decided to arrest its top leadership including Tadesse Birru. The pretext for this arrest was a bomb explosion in an Addis Ababa movie house that was attributed to him. The Mecha-Tulama was banned shortly thereafter. Tadesse Birru was brought to trial in 1968 and condemned to death, a sentence later commuted to life in prison. Mamo Mezemir was also sentenced to death and he was executed on February 28, 1969. Mecha-Tulama was significant for several reasons. It was an indication that political sentiments could not be suppressed merely by forbidding political parties. The movement sensitized the Oromo to the importance of their own national culture and to the contradiction inherent in the emerging politico-economic system. The group that founded the Oromo Liberation Front in 1974 consisted largely of former members of this association.Fessha, Yonatan Tesfaye.

This air leakage is driven by differential pressures across the building envelope due to the combined effects of stack, external wind and mechanical ventilation systems.G. Guyot, F. R. Carrié and P. Schild, “Project ASIEPI – Stimulation of good building and ductwork airtightness through EPBD,” 2010 Airtightness is the fundamental building property that impacts infiltration and exfiltration (the uncontrolled inward and outward leakage of outdoor air through cracks, interstices or other unintentional openings of a building, caused by pressure effects of the wind and/or stack effect).M. Limb, \\"Technical note AIVC 36- Air Infiltration and Ventilation Glossary,\\" International Energy Agency energy conservation in buildings and community systems programme, 1992 An airtight building has several positive impactsBuilding Energy Codes, “Building Technologies Program: Air Leakage Guide”, U.S Department of Energy, September 2011 when combined with an appropriate ventilation system (whether natural, mechanical, or hybrid):U.S. Department of Energy, “enVerid Systems - HVAC Load Reduction”. Retrieved August 2018 * Lower heating bills due to less heat loss, with potentially smaller requirements for heating and cooling equipment capacities * Better performing ventilation system * Reduced chance of mold and rot because moisture is less likely to enter and become trapped in cavities * Fewer draughts and thus increased thermal comfort A number of studies have shown substantial energy savings by tightening building envelopes. The ASIEPI project technical report on building and ductwork airtightness estimates the energy impact of envelope airtightness in the order of 10 kWh per m2 of floor area per year, for the heating needs in a moderately cold region (2500 degree- days). Experimental data showing the energy savings of good airtightness were also published by the Building Research Establishment in the UKD. Butler and A. Perry, \\"Co-heating Tests on BRE Test Houses Before and After Remedial Air Sealing,\\" Building Research Establishment as well as REHVA journals' special issue on airtightness.R. Coxon, “Research into the effect of improving airtightness in a typical UK dwelling,” The REHVA European HVAC Journal- Special issue on airtightness, vol. 50, no. 1, pp. 24-27, 2013. They conclude 15% of the space conditioning energy use can be saved in the UK context going from 11.5 m3/(m2·h) @50 Pa (average current value) down to 5 m3/(m2·h) @50 Pa (achievable). Given its impacts on heat losses, good building airtightness may allow installation of smaller heating and cooling capacities. Conversely, poor airtightness may prevent achieving the desired indoor temperature conditions if the equipment has not been sized with proper estimates of infiltration heat losses. From an energy point of view, it is almost always desirable to increase air tightness, but if infiltration is providing useful dilution of indoor contaminants, indoor air quality may suffer.M.H. Sherman and R. Chan, \\"Building Airtightness: Research and Practice\\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report NO. LBNL-53356, 2004 However, it is often unclear how useful this dilution is because building leaks cause uncontrolled airflows and potentially poorly ventilated rooms although the total building air exchange rate may be sufficient.L. Mouradian and X. Boulanger, \\"QUAD-BBC, Indoor Air Quality and ventilation systems in low energy buildings,\\" AIVC Newsletter No2, June 2012 This adverse effect has been confirmed by numerical simulations in the French context which has shown that typical mechanical ventilation systems yielded better indoor air quality with tighter envelopes. Air leaking across the envelope from the relatively warm & humid side to the relatively cold & dry side may cause condensation and related damage as its temperature drops below the dew point.TightVent Europe: Building and Ductwork Airitightness Platform, http://tightvent.eu/J.Langmans \\"Feasibility of exterior air barriers in timber frame construction\\", 2013 Air leakage pathways Common leakage sites classified in 4 categories Leakage typically occurs at the following locations on the building envelope:F.R. Carrié, R. Jobert, V. Leprince: “Contributed report 14. Methods and techniques for airtight buildings”, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, 2012 * Junctions between walls and other walls or floors * Junctions between window frames and walls * Electrical equipment * Access doors and other wall penetrations Vertical section of a typical building with identification of potential leakage junctions Common leakage sites are listed in the Figure and explained below: # Junction lower floor / vertical wall # Junction window sill / vertical wall # Junction window lintel / vertical wall # Junction window reveal / vertical wall (horizontal view) # Vertical wall (Cross section) # Perforation vertical wall # Junction top floor / vertical wall # Penetration of top floor # Junction French window / vertical wall # Junction inclined roof / vertical wall # Penetration inclined roof # Junction inclined roof / roof ridge # Junction inclined roof / window # Junction rolling blind / vertical wall # Junction intermediate floor / vertical wall # Junction exterior door lintel / vertical wall # Junction exterior door sill / sill # Penetration lower floor / crawlspace or basement # Junction service shaft / access door # Junction internal wall / intermediate floor Metrics The airtightness of a building is often expressed in terms of the leakage airflow rate through the building's envelope at a given reference pressure (usually 50 pascal) divided by the: * Heated building volume V. At 50·Pa, it is called the air change rate at 50 Pa and usually noted n50(units: h−1).ISO Standard 9972, “Thermal Insulation-Determination of Building Air Tightness – Fan Pressurization Method”, International Standards Organization, 2006EN 13829:2000, \\"Thermal performance of building - Determination of air permeability of buildings - Fan pressurization method (ISO 9972:1996, modified)\\", 2000 * Envelope area AE. At 50 Pa, it is called the air permeability at 50 Pa and noted usually q50 or qa50 (units: m3/(h·m2)) * Floor area AF. At 50 Pa, it is called the specific leakage rate and usually noted w50 (units: m3/(h·m2)) The effective leakage area (ELA) at a reference pressure is also a common metric used to characterize envelope airtightness. It represents the area of a perfect orifice that would produce the same airflow rate as that passing through the building envelope at the reference pressure. To allow comparisons between buildings, the ELA may be divided by the envelope or floor area, or may be used to derive the normalized leakage area (NL).ASHRE, \\"ASHRAE Handbook-Fundamentals\\" Atlanta, 2013 For all of these metrics, the lower the 'airtightness' value is for a given building, the more airtight the building's envelope is. Power law model of airflow through leaks The relationship between pressure and leakage air flow rate is defined by the power law between the airflow rate and the pressure difference across the building envelope as follows:R. Carrié & P. Wouters, \\"Technical note AIVC 67- Building airtightness: a critical review of testing, reporting and quality schemes in 10 countries,\\" International Energy Agency energy conservation in buildings and community systems programme, 2012. qL=CL∆pn where: * qL is the volumetric leakage airflow rate expressed in m3h−1 * CL is the air leakage coefficient expressed in m3h−1Pa−n * ∆p is the pressure difference across the building envelope expressed in Pa * n is the airflow exponent (0.5 ≤ n ≤ 1) This law enables to assess the airflow rate at any pressure difference regardless the initial measurement.  Fan pressurization test  Building airtightness levels can be measured by using a fan, temporarily installed in the building envelope (a blower door) to pressurize the building. Air flow through the fan creates an internal, uniform, static pressure within the building. The aim of this type of measurement is to relate the pressure differential across the envelope to the air flow rate required to produce it. Generally, the higher the flow rate required to produce a given pressure difference, the less airtight the building. The fan pressurization technique is also described in many standard test methods, such as ASTM E779 - 10,ASTM, Standard E779-10, “Test Method for Determining Air Leakage by Fan Pressurization”, ASTM Book of Standards, American Society of Testing and Materials, Vol. 4 (11), 2010 ASTM E1827 – 11,ASTM, Standard E1827-11, “Standard Test Methods for Determining Airtightness of Buildings Using an Orifice Blower Door”, ASTM Book of Standards, American Society of Testing and Materials, Vol. 4 (11), 2011. CAN/CGSB-149.10-M86,CAN/CGSB Standard 149, “Determination of the Airtightness of Building Envelopes by Fan Depressurization Method”, Canadian General Standards Board, 1986 CAN/CGSB-149.15-96,CAN/CGSB Standard 149.15-96, “Determination of the Overall Envelope Airtightness of Buildings by the Fan Pressurization Method Using the Building's Air Handling Systems”, Canadian General Standards Board, 1996 ISO 9972:2006 (now superseded), & EN 13829 which is now 'withdrawn' due to the updated ISO 9972:2015. Airtightness requirements Most European countries include in their regulations either required or recommended minimum airtightness levels with or without mandatory testing. There are several countries (e.g., United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Denmark, Ireland) where, by regulation, airtightness testing is mandatory for certain building types or in the case of specific programmes.R. Carrié, M. Kapsalaki and P. Wouters, \\"Right and Tight: What's new in Ductwork and Building Airtightness?,\\" BUILD UP energy solutions for better buildings, 19 March 2013. In the US, the IECC of 2012 adopted whole building airtightness requirements, including mandatory testing.International Code Council: \\"2012 International Energy Conservation Code\\", 2012 In addition, in May, 2012, USACE issued a new Engineering and Construction Bulletin in collaboration with the Air Barrier Association of America, outlining Army requirements for building airtightness and building air leakage testing for new and renovation construction projects.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers & Air Barrier Association of America: \\"Air Leakage Test Protocol for Building Envelopes\\", 2012 Washington was the first State to institute air barrier requirements with both a maximum material air leakage requirement and a whole building maximum air permeability rate with testing requirements for buildings six stories and higher.W. Anis : \\"The changing requirements of airtightness in the US\\", proceedings of the AIVC -TightVent Workshop: \\"Building & Ductwork airtightness: Design, Implementation, Control and Durability: Feedback from Practice and Perspectives\\", 18–19 April 2013 There are several voluntary programs that require a minimum airtightness level for the building envelope (Passivhaus, Minergie-P, Effinergie etc.). Historically, the Passivhaus standard, originated in 1988 was the cornerstone for envelope airtightness developments because these types of buildings require extremely low leakage levels (n50 below 0.6 ach).

It was completed two years later in September 1866, which was celebrated by another public holiday and a gala ball. The design by Henry Hunter was somewhat inspired by the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. At the time of construction, it was designed to house the City of Hobart's council chambers, as well as police offices, the municipal court and the State Library of Tasmania. These remained in use for nearly fifty years after the town hall was opened.

It stands to the north of the southern tip of Gibraltar, Europa Point, which was long felt to be potentially vulnerable to a surprise attack from the sea and was heavily fortified with gun batteries, perimeter walls and scarped cliffs. In 1841, Major General Sir John Thomas Jones recommended in a report on Gibraltar's fortifications that a line of retrenchments should be built at the head of Windmill Hill to block an invader's line of advance from Europa Point up the peninsula. The hill provided a formidable defensive position which enfiladed the road from Europa; as Jones put it, \\"Two hundred men on Windmill Hill and Europa Pass ought to hold as many thousands at bay.\\" The barracks, which Jones himself designed, was originally intended to be accompanied by a citadel which would serve as a central rallying point. This, however, proved too expensive and was never built. In its final form, the barracks consisted of two demi-bastions, joined by a curtain wall behind which the main barracks block is located. Four gun embrasures were built on the right demi-bastion and one on the left flank, providing a defence from naval bombardment, while the top of the wall is loopholed to accommodate rifles along almost all of its length. The barracks block is constructed of white limestone quarried locally and stands two stories high with a basement.

A noted cryptographer, taxonomist and phytogeographer, he was notable for his furthering of botanical exploration in tropical and sub-tropical Africa, and was an authority on the family Combretaceae. Exell's formal education started at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Warwickshire, and then King Edmund's School in Birmingham. From there he went on to Emmanuel College, Cambridge and was awarded an M.A. in 1926, having joined the British Museum as a second-class assistant on 11 August 1924, eventually becoming Deputy Keeper of Botany in 1950. He was entrusted with the Polypetalae, although his first paper was a morphological study of the hymenium in three species of fungus. Exell's first contact with Africa was in 1932/3 when he travelled to the islands in the Gulf of Guinea – São Tomé and Principe, Bioko and Annobon. His reports on the expedition were published in 1944 as a \\"Catalogue of the Vascular Plants of S. Tome\\", which for many years served as the standard reference to the islands' flora. The expedition also acquainted Exell with the Portuguese botanists Luis Carrisso and Francisco de Ascensão Mendonça of Coimbra University. Accompanied by them and his wife, Exell launched into a study of the flora of Angola, at that time a Portuguese colony. Also in their group was John Gossweiler (1873–1952), the government botanist in Angola. During the journey Carrisso suffered a fatal heart attack. Exell continued his collaboration with Coimbra University and Mendonça, publishing the first volume of the \\"Conspectus Florae Angolensis\\" (1937–1951). During the Second World War, Exell's knowledge of Portuguese – he was also fluent in French and German – led to his being seconded to the Government Communications Headquarters at Bletchley Park, and working as a cryptographer in Cheltenham. Returning to the British Museum (Natural History) in 1950, he founded the 'Association pour l'Etude Taxonomique de la Flore d'Afrique Tropicale' (AETFAT) and started the Flora Zambesiaca project, the flora covering the catchment area of the Zambesi River, which at the time comprised the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Bechuanaland, the Caprivi strip and Mozambique. He visited the region in 1955 with Mendonça to make further collections. He was co-editor of Flora Zambesiaca from 1962 onwards, and was awarded a D.Sc. by the University of Coimbra in Portugal in 1962. In 1971 the Portuguese government conferred on him the 'Comendador Da Ordem De Santiago da Espada'. He also received the Order of the British Empire in 1961, and was a member of the Linnean Society of London and other scientific societies. Exell left the British Museum as Deputy Keeper of Botany in 1962. Working from home, he carried out part-time work for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. On his retirement, he and his wife moved to the village of Blockley in the Cotswolds, becoming involved in local affairs.

It started in 1903 and is named in honour of Arthur Dunn who had proposed such a competition but died very suddenly shortly after. Dunn was a leading amateur player of his day and was in the winning Old Etonians side in the 1882 FA Cup Final. It was Dunn who passed the ball to Anderson who scored the only goal to defeat Blackburn Rovers at the Kennington Oval.Daily Telegraph - 31 March 1882 The Arthur Dunn Cup is presented by Susannah Ross, Great-grand-daughter of Arthur Dunn.  Origins of the Cup Competition  On 12 October 1901, an article appeared in a newspaper headed \\"Amateur Clubs and the English Cup\\". It began \\"It has been said that amateur football is in the decline, that it is not what it was, and that its ultimate insignificance is, in fact, merely a matter of time\\".Fabian, A H; Green, Geoffrey, Association Football, Volume two, p 140-146. The Caxton Publishing Company Ltd., London 1960 This reflected the growing impression that amateur football was doomed and when Arthur Dunn read this, he was so moved that he wrote a brief note to another Old Etonian, Norman Malcolmson, as follows: Arthur did not have time to follow this thought through because he died suddenly on the evening of 19 February 1902.Grayson, Edward, Corinthians and Cricketers and Towards a New Sporting Era. Yore Publications, Harefield, Middlesex 1955 (Other sources state the date of death as 20 February and this is the date on his memorial at Eton College). However, on 12 March 1902, just three weeks later, an informal meeting of Old Boys interested in amateur football was convened by Norman Malcolmson and held at the Sports Club. At this meeting the following resolutions were passed: # That, in the opinion of this Meeting, an annual competition, under Association Rules, in the form of a cup contest, confined to the representatives of the chief Public Schools, is desirable; # That a trophy, to be called \\"The Arthur Dunn Memorial Cup\\", or by some such title, be provided for competition, to be held by the winners for one year; # That the following schools be invited to appoint one representative to act on the General Committee: Bradfield, Brighton, Charterhouse, Eton, Felsted, Forest, Harrow, Lancing, Malvern, Radley, Repton, Rossall, Shrewsbury, Westminster and Winchester, the competition to be for the Old Boys of the above schoolsMinutes of the first meeting of the Arthur Dunn Cup 1902 Those present also expressed the view that any surplus profits from the competition should be given to charity. This informal meeting was followed, three weeks later, by a formal one, at which the chair was taken by no less a figure that C Wreford-Brown, a pillar of the Corinthians and capped four times for England in full internationals. The motions passed by the informal meeting were unanimously confirmed, and then officers were elected as follows: President: Lord Kinnaird (Eton); Vice-Presidents: R C Guy (Forest); R C Gosling (Eton); Committee: R T Squire (Westminster), G O Smith (Charterhouse), W J Oakley (Shrewsbury), C Wreford-Brown (Charterhouse), R E Foster (Malvern), W M Cowan (Brighton), J R Mason (Winchester). Hon Secretary: N Malcolmson.Fabian, A H; Green, Geoffrey, Association Football, Volume two, p 140-146. The Caxton Publishing Company Ltd., London 1960 During the next few weeks a special committee drew up the rules of the competition. Meanwhile, the actual trophy was presented by R C Gosling; and thus, within 14 weeks of Dunn’s death, the vision had become a reality. Six months later the Arthur Dunn Challenge Cup competition was well and truly launched, the schools taking part in the first season being: Bradfield, Brighton, Charterhouse, Eton, Felsted, Forest, Harrow, Lancing, Malvern, Repton, Rossall, Shrewsbury, Westminster and Winchester. Radley College decided not to participate at this stage.Roy, David; Bevan, Ian; Hibberd, Stuart; Gilbert, Michael, The Centenary History of the Arthur Dunn Cup. Replay Publishing Limited, Beckenham, Kent 2003  The first Winners  The first Arthur Dunn Challenge Cup Final was held on 28 March 1903 at The Crystal Palace. The two teams at that first final were Old Carthusians and Old Salopians. In a keen and close game, the result was a draw (2 – 2) even after 20 minutes extra time and it was decided to replay at Ealing on Wednesday 1 April. Coincidentally this game too ended in a 2 – 2 draw, and so it was then decided that the Cup should be held jointly by these two clubs, six months each.  The first 100 Finals  The first 25 Finals were dominated by the Old Carthusians who appeared in 11 Finals and won the Cup nine times. The Old Malvernians appeared in nine Finals and won the Cup six times. During these years the Old Carthusians won the Cup every year between 1903 and 1906 and in 1921/2/3. The Old Malvernians also won the Cup three years in succession on 1924/5/6. In all, 11 different sides reached the Final and the Old Brightonians, who won the Cup in 1913, are the only winners that no longer play in the competition.Brighton College Magazine, 1913 In November 1913, Warren Lewis, then a student at Malvern College and the older brother of C. S. Lewis, was in attendance for a portion of the competition. The Second World War interfered with the second 25 Finals so the 50th Final was not played until 1964. Again, 11 sides reached the Finals and the Old Salopians were the most dominant side reaching 10 Finals and winning seven times, including the 50th Final.The Field, 16 April 1964 They were followed by the Old Carthusians who reached eight Finals and won on seven occasions. Fifteen of the 16 Finals played between 1933 and 1955 were won by only three sides - Old Carthusians, Old Salopians and Old Wykehamists. The Wykehamists shared the Cup with the Old Malvernians in 1938 and the Old Salopians shared it with the Old Brentwoods in 1955.The Times - article unpublished due to paper strike 1955 There were three new winners in this period, the Old Aldenhamians in 1934, the Old Brentwoods and the Old Cholmelians in 1958 and 1959 respectively. The third quarter of the 100 Finals were dominated by those arch rivals, the Old Malvernians, who played in 13 Finals and won the Cup on eight occasions, and the Old Reptonians who played in six Finals and won it five times. Again, 11 sides reached the Finals in this period but there were three new sides who made their mark. Lancing Old Boys played in four Finals and won the Cup in successive years between 1983-5 (the last side to win three years in a row), the Old Chigwellians won in 1980 and the Old Foresters won in 1974. The Old Brentwoods appeared in 11 Finals but only managed to win the Cup on four occasions. The 75th Final in 1989 was between the Old Malvernians and the Old Brentwoods. In the last 24 years, 14 sides have reached the Final and from a much wider range. Substitutes were first allowed in 1997 when Old Foresters won the Cup.Daily Telegraph, 7 April 1997 Yet once again, the Old Carthusians have been the most dominant side, reaching eight Finals, seven of them in the last 13 years when they have won the Cup six times. The Old Salopians have appeared in six Finals winning the Cup on four occasions including the Centenary Final in 2003. This Final was held at Cobham. Unsurprisingly, the finalists were Old Salopians and Old Carthusians who had met in the first Final in 1903. Old Salopians won 2 – 1. The Old Etonians at last won the Cup (Arthur Dunn being an Old Etonian) in 2005 and 2010. The Old Harrovians won for the first time on 2007 and the Old Tonbridgians won in 2012 becoming the first of the newer Old Boys teams to win the Cup. Over this period, the Cup competition has been supported by Arthur Dunn's wife, Helen Dunn, his daughter Mary Shirley and his granddaughter, Jane Sawyer.Roy, David, Programme for the 100th Final 2014  The 100th Final  The 100th Final was a repeat of the first final between the Old Salopians and the Old Carthusians.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2399224/Arthur-Dunn-Cup- Centenary-Final-Chester-hits-clincher.html Unlike the first final where the Old Carthusians and the Old Salopians shared the title after a drawn replay, the Old Salopians won the centenary final 2-1.

The original St. James was platted by the St. James Co. by July 1857, occupying the eastern and western halves of Sections 11 and 12, resp., in Township 32N Range 2E, with Deming as president. Townsley, a shareholder, sold part of his interest to Gates P. Thurston, who arrived from Dayton, Ohio in the spring of 1857 and is credited with laying out the original townsite with hopes of its eventually becoming Nebraska's state capital. Thurston, who became Cedar County’s 1st Judge, built a 1-1/2 story log building, intended to be a courthouse, near this site. Though the original St. James was named Cedar County Seat when the county was organized by the Territorial Legislature on February 12, 1857,Jones, L. E. “A Brief History of Cedar County, Nebraska.” Read by Mr. Jones July 4, 1876.

Instead it was used for religious services, meetings and as a fortress against Indian scares. By 1860 St. James had a population of 50 which, according to that year's federal census, included a merchant, carpenter, blacksmith, engineer, mechanic, minister, and lawyer as head of household. However, when a new flour mill was built in the mid-1860s about 1.5 miles upstream on Bow Creek, the original St. James Landing townsite moved to the mill's location and what is now called Old St. James began to grow rapidly. Eventually Old St. James had the mill plus two hotels, a drug store, two merchandise stores, a saloon, two banks, a lumber store, two hardware stores, a blacksmith shop, two churches and a school. Henson Wiseman, among the St. James area's first permanent settlers, arrived there in 1857. Five Wiseman children were massacred by Native Americans near St. James July 24, 1863. Other 1857 area settlers were James Hay, O.D. Smith, Saby Strahm, John Andres, John McCoubray, a Mr. Wadsworth, and Henry, Ernest, Gustav and Herman Ferber, and their father, Paul Ferber. St. James Post Office, established July 13, 1858, was initially located in the pocket of whoever was postmaster at the time but soon was situated in Old St. James. It was discontinued May 31, 1909 when service began from nearby Wynot. Private education in the St. James area started in 1861 and the first public school in Cedar County, called St. James School, was built in 1867 ~2 miles north-northwest of Old Saint James, near the Jones “Bow Valley” Mills.Jones, Edith. \\"Bow Valley Mills: A Brief Visit to the Past.\\" Cedar County News. Hartington, NE. January 29, 1975. School District 1 was formally organized there April 30, 1873 and closed January 2, 1953. Later, District 10 also provided public and parochial education in the area. An 1869 vote that moved the county seat to St. Helena and a failed attempt in 1876 for rail service curtailed Old St. James' growth. Thus its population, 81 in 1880, peaked at about 100 inhabitants in 1882. A 2nd attempt for rail service to Old St. James occurred in 1906 when the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railroad was asked to extend its line from nearby Newcastle. But the rail terminus was built across Bow Creek, one mile west of Old St. James, resulting in the new town of Wynot. Soon Old St. James’ businesses, its churches and people moved to Wynot. Old St. James today consists of a farmplace and several residential lots. One mile southeast of Old St. James are the SS Philip and James Catholic Cemetery, St. James Marketplace, a business, and several homes. Many people from Old St. James are buried in the former St. James public cemetery, now called the Wynot Public Cemetery, located ¾ mile west-southwest of Old St. James on a hill just south of Wynot.

He is best known for his work on churches. During his life was also at various times a state magistrate of Tasmania, a member of the Tasmanian State Board of Education, the Hobart Board of Health, a Commissioner for the New Norfolk Insane Asylum and President of the Queensland Institute of Architects. Life Hunter was born in Nottingham, England, son of Walter and Tomasina Hunter. His father was also an architect, and he studied the craft under his father before attending the Nottingham School of Design. He immigrated to Australia in 1848 with his two sisters and parents, originally settling in South Australia before moving to Tasmania. Upon the death of his parents 2–3 years after arrival in Australia, he moved to Tasmania where his older brother George Hunter, Archdeacon of St Joseph's, had already settled. Hunter spent a short period in the Victorian goldfields on his way to Tasmania, before properly immigrating to the island state. He became engaged in the Huon Valley timber trade for several years, and in 1858 married a Miss Robertson – orphan daughter of an officer. He began work as an architect the same year. He worked in Tasmania for 37 years, during which he also engaged in a number of civic roles and was a noted local singer. He co- starred with Amy Sherwin in an amateur performance of Il trovatore, and was leader of the St Joseph's Church Choir for 30 years. He moved to Brisbane in 1888 where he opened an architectural firm with his former apprentice Leslie Corrie. Upon his departure a farewell dinner was organised by builders and architects of Hobart, attended by the Lord Mayor of Hobart, Premier of Tasmania and the state Attorney General. During his time in Brisbane he remained a prominent architect, being President of the Queensland Institute of Architects in 1890 and Vice President in 1891. His most notable works in Brisbane were additions made to the All Hallows' School convent and the design of the Queensland Deposit Bank.

Early life Müşfika Kadın was born on 10 December 1867 in Hopa, Caucasus, Ottoman Empire. Born as Ayşe Ağırba, she was a member of Abkhazian noble family, Ağır. Her father was Gazi Şehid Ağır Mahmud Bey, and her mother was Emine Hanım. She had a sister named Fatma Hanım one year younger than her, as well as a brother named Şahin Bey seven years older than her. Mahmud Bey volunteered for service in the Ottoman-Russian war of 1877–78, entrusting his wife and children to the care of Hüseyin Vasfi Pasha, an army officer posted in the area. Hüseyin Vasfi Pasha's wife Bezminigar Hanım was Mahmud Bey's cousin, hence a close relative, and moreover had been in service to valide sultan Pertevniyal Sultan before her marriage, so for these reasons the pasha sent Mahmud Bey's family to live with his wife in Istanbul. At that time Ayşe was eight years old, Fatma was seven and Şahin Bey fifteen. In those days Pertevniyal Sultan was despondent over the death of her son Sultan Abdulaziz. Her only pleasure and distraction lay in passing time by training young children, gathering them about her and finding consolation in their behavior. Knowing these things Bezminigar Hanım decided to present Mahmud Bey's family to Pertevniyal Sultan. With difficulty she won over Emine Hanım, then she took the two girls round. Pertevniyal Sultan was enchanted by Emine Hanım's beautiful face, blue eyes and blonde hair and by the sweet aspects of Fatma's head of curls. She adopted the two girls and ordered Navekyar Kalfa to look after Ayşe and Şevkidide Kalfa to look after Fatma, under the protection of her own high Hazinedar Şemsicemal Kalfa, and changed their names, as palace tradition had it, calling her Destizer (), and her sister Destiper. Their mother Emine Hanım and older brother Şahin Bey remained in the home of Bezminigar Hanım, but when the word arrived that Mahmud Bey had been killed in the war, despite all attempts to dissuade them they returned to the palace which they had come. After this nothing further was heard of them. When Pertevniyal Sultan died in 1884, as custom dictated all the servants in villa, headed by the High Hazinedar, were transferred to Dolmabahçe Palace. Marriage Destizer grew into a young lady in Dolmabahçe Palace, and when she entered her eighteenth year she was noticed by Abdul Hamid II, who in those days was in the habit of going to the harem after the ceremony of receiving felicitations on festival days. She was taken to the Yıldız Palace straightaway. The marriage took place on 12 February 1886, and was performed by the Deputy of the Noble Sweeper, Seyid Esad Efendi and witnessed by the Superintendent of Departures, Hacı Mahmud Efendi, by the Imam of Kağıthane, Ali Efendi and by the Senior Equerry, Şerafeddin Ağa. As his first gift to her, Abdul Hamid presented her with an exquisite copy of the Quran, which was made in nesih talik by Kazasker Mustafa İzzet (died 1876) in 1871. He gave her the name \\"Müşfikâ\\", and the title of \\"Senior Fortunate\\". As had been the case with Abdul Hamid's other wives, once Müşfika joined their ranks the apartments known as the Lesser Chancellery were then made ready. A household staff was delegated, with Dilesrar Kalfa appointed mistress of the household. She was well known in the palace because she had been in service since the latter days of the reign of Sultan Abdulmejid I and had served Sultan Abdulaziz. Abdul Hamid made Müşfika's sister, Destiper hazinedar with the name of Şükriye Hanım. When Şükriye Hanım came of age, she was given in marriage to Halid Pasha, the second son of Abdul Hamid's Master of the Robes Ismet Bey, whose mother was Abdul Hamid's wet nurse. In 1917, some five months before Abdul Hamid's death, Şükriye Hanım died of typhoid. Abdul Hamid was in Beylerbeyi Palace when he was informed of her death, and it was Abdul Hamid who paid the expenses for her shroud and for laying out her corpse. She lies in the cemetery at Rumeli Hisarı. On 31 October 1887, year after the marriage, she gave birth to her only daughter, Ayşe Sultan. Abdul Hamid presented a brooch to Filürye Kalfa, who had brought the news of Ayşe's birth to him. Ebezade Kamile Hanım, who served as midwife at Ayşe's birth was presented with three hundred liras, and Dr. Triandafilidis, the specialist in women's diseases of that era who had examined and treated Müşfika every week during her pregnancy was conferred with a decoration. Before Ayşe's birth Abdul Hamid had ordered the construction of a villa known as the New Villa on the grounds of Yıldız Palace. In 1888, when Ayşe was seven months old Abdul Hamid relocated her to this villa. Müşfika was Abdul Hamid's favourite wife and Ayşe was his favourite daughter. Until the end of his reign, Abdul Hamid used to have dinner with Müşfika in her apartments. On 27 April 1909, Abdul Hamid was deposed, and sent into exile in Thessaloniki, and Müşfika and Ayşe accompanied him. Ayşe returned to Istanbul in 1910, however, Müşfika remained with him. But after Thessaloniki fell to Greece in 1912, she returned to Istanbul with Abdul Hamid, and settled in the Beylerbeyi Palace. Truly Müşfika did prove to be a felicitous, exceedingly compassionate life's comparison for Abdul Hamid, as until the end of his days she shared in all the tragedies that befell him, and when Abdul Hamid died in 1918, she was holding him in her arms. Widowhood After Abdul Hamid's death, she moved firstly to Yıldız Palace, and after sometime moved in with her daughter Ayşe Sultan. She donated the Quran, that Abdul Hamid had presented to her at the time of her marriage, to the pious foundation that maintained Abdul Hamid's mausoleum and had her name inscribed in it. In 1924, Ayşe, together with other members of his family were sent into exile. As being an adjunct member of the imperial family Müşfika was not exiled, and chose to remain in Turkey. She moved to a mansion in Serencebey. In 1934, in accordance to the Surname Law, she took the surname \\"Kayısoy\\" pertaining to Abdul Hamid's descendance from the Kayıhan tribe. In 1936, she petitioned to the Turkish government for restitution of property because she had become destitute. However, the Foreign Office noted that she had never been placed in effective ownership and possession of her share of Abdul Hamid's properties and revenues in Turkey at the time of Abdul Hamid’s death or at any subsequent date. Also previously in 1925 and 1928 respectively, she and Şevket Mehmet Ali Bey, a banker representing her had given the power of attorney to Sami Günzberg, a well-known Turkish Jewish lawyer, authorizing him to regain from usurpers buildings, lands, mines, concessions left by Abdul Hamid situated in Turkish territory and elsewhere. In 1944, she applied to the government for financial assistance, after which in 1949, President İsmet İnönü fixed her monthly allowance to two hundred liras. Unable to get along with this amount of allowance, she wrote to the then President Adnan Menderes in 1954, after which fifty liras were added to her allowance. Ayşe returned to Istanbul in 1952, after some twenty eight years, and wrote her memoir, completing it by 1955. For large portions of the memoir she relied on Müşfika, as the two lived together after the princess's return to Turkey. The work originally appeared in the serial format in the Turkish popular magazine Hayat in the late 1950s, followed by its publication as a book in Istanbul in 1960, shortly before the princess's death. Death Müşfika Kadın died of pleurisy on 18 July 1961 at the age of ninety-three, at Serencebey mansion no. 53, Yıldız, Istanbul, Turkey, nearly a year after her daughter's death. Her time of death was announced to be 22:00. She is buried in the royal mausoleum of Yahya Efendi Cemetery.

It is a publicly traded company on NASDAQ, with several products approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On August 15, 2018, the company announced its name change from Depomed, Inc., to Assertio Therapeutics, Inc. As of 2019, Assertio markets three products approved by the FDA: Gralise, Cambia, and Zipsor.  History = 1995-2009  Depomed was founded in 1995 and later became headquartered in Newark, California. A joint venture between Élan and Depomed, DDL, was established in January 2000. Élan withdrew from operational involvement in September 2003, with Depomed gaining full ownership. In September 2003, the company's subsidiary Depomed Development Ltd. acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Gabapentin ER. The drug had been developed by DDL. 2003 saw a net loss of $30 million, compared to $13.5 million in 2002. In 2004, John W. Fara was president, CEO, and chairman. The company had 75 people, and was starting a new focus on marketing after FDA approvals for Proquin XR and Depomed's filing of Glumetza for approval. By May 2004, Depomed had been issued a patent covering the use of gabapentin to treat hot flushes. That month, it also received a patent covering \\"proprietary polymer combinations (as used in AcuForm tablets) to create improved formulations of existing drugs.\\" The patent was first sublicensed to the University of Rochester, then PharmaNova in October 2006. The company faced a net loss of $24.5 million in 2005, compared to a net loss of $27 million in 2004. In April 2006, Depomed entered a license agreement with Esprit Pharma over Proquin XR, a \\"prolonged-release formulation of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride\\" to treat urinary tract infections. In July 2008, the FDA released a warning about drugs such as Depomed Inc's Proquin XR, an antibiotic, about the risk of tendonitis and ruptured tendons.  2010-2014  By 2010 the company was based in Menlo Park, California, and stated it intended to become profitable in 2011. By 2010, Depomed was supplying its entire logistics system with plastic pallets, after it had to recall a shipment of the diabetes drug Glumetza for potential contamination of wood pallets. As of March 2011, Carl A. Pelzel was CEO and president of Depomed. Depomed had one approved product on the market, Gralise, and had one other approved but not released: Glumetza. That month, Boehringer Ingelheim purchased the rights to use Depomed's Acuform manufacturing technology. The FDA approved Gralise for the management of postherpetic neralgia in January 2012. On June 21, 2012, Depomed acquired the rights to Zipsor, an NSAID made by Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals. In particular, the Zipsor Liquid Filled Capsules were acquired. Revenue generated by Zipsor was approximately as within the twelve months from June 2011 to May 2012. For $240 million, DL BioPharma purchased the royalty rights to Depomed's Glumetza, a type 2 diabetes drug, in October 2013. The year prior, Depomed had generated $43 million in royalty revenue off the drug.  2015-2017  In January 2015, Depomed acquired Nucynta ER and XR from Johnson & Johnson for $1.05 billion. Horizon Pharma made a hostile $3 billion bid for Depomed in July 2015, withdrawing the bid after the Depomed board rejected the offer. At the time, Depomed had five pain treatments on the market, including Nucynta, considered its flagship product. Assets in 2015 came to $1.3 billion. Equity that year was $315 million, and it had 494 employees that December. In early April 2016, activist investor Starboard Value accused DepoMed of being \\"unfriendly to shareholders,\\" noting in part a plan to relocate from California to Delaware. Several weeks later, the Delaware move was dropped. In September 2016, there were reports that Depomed was considering a sale, after Starboard called for the option to be explored in April 2016. In October 2016, Starboard Value struck a deal with Depomed that gave the former three more spots on Depomed's board. In March 2017, more activity by activist investors resulted in CEO Jim Schoeneck being replaced by Arthur Higgins. In December 2017, Depomed announced it was moving away from the opioid market and divesting of its Nucynta opioid franchise. Nucynta's rights were sold to Collegium Pharmaceutical, for $10 million upfront and royalty payments until December 2022. That year, Depomed's net revenue was $381 million.  2018-2019  In January 2018 the company laid off 40% of its workforce after the divestment of its pain medication Nucynta. On August 15, 2018, the company announced its name change from Depomed, Inc., to Assertio Therapeutics, Inc. In 2018, Assertio also moved its headquarters from California to Lake Forest, from Newark, California to Lake Forest, Illinois. By March 2019, Assertio's stock had lost half its value since 2016. In September 2019, Crain's Chicago Business argued that Assertio's diversification campaign was \\"sputtering\\", with Assertio stock having dropped 80% in the prior year. Operating income in 2019 was $3.33 million. Becker's Hospital Review listed it as one of 31 drugmakers at high risk of going bankrupt in 2020.  Products and manufacturing  By 2010 the company was based in Menlo Park, California, and was known for improving \\"the bio- availability of generic drugs by using polymers usually used in the food and cosmetics industry to reduce side effects and lower the doses necessary for oral medications.\\" As of 2019, Assertio markets three products approved by the FDA: Gralise, Cambia, and Zipsor. The company's products include Gralise, Cambia, Lazanda, Zipsor, and DM-1992, which mainly focus on pain, neuropathic pain, and central nervous system diseases. In January 2011, Gralise once-daily (gabapentin extended release) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. The drug has also received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA. The company's diabetes treatment, Glumetza (metformin hydrochloride extended release tablet), was approved for the treatment of type II diabetes in adults, and is sold in the US by Valeant.  Former products  Assertio Therapeutics previously owned Nucynta ER and Nucynta IR. On January 15, 2015, Depomed announced the acquisition of the Tapentadol(Nucynta) franchise from Janssen Pharmaceutica for in cash. The transaction closed on April 2, 2015, and the products were relaunched in June 2015 after a major sales force expansion. After Hurricane Maria in 2017 the company faced major shortages of the drug due to the manufacturing plant location in Puerto Rico. In January 2018, after less than 3 years, the manufacturing rights of Nucynta were sold for just $10 million upfront with a $135 million in royalties for the first 4 years. Tapentadol is now produced for the US and Canadian market by Collegium Pharmaceutical.  Lawsuits  The company has been active in patent litigation. In 2002, the company received $18 million from the Bristol- Myers Squibb Company concerning a patent litigation settlement. In April 2008, Depomed sued IVAX for introducing a generic Glumetza product, forcing IVAX's owner Teva Pharmaceutical Industries into paying a $7.5 million settlement on the matter. By May 2010, Depomed also had had patient victories against Viovail Corporation. In March 2012, the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against three companies that had filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the US FDA, claiming infringement of Depomed's six US patents listed for Gralise in the FDA's Orange Book. In August 2018, Purdue Pharma paid Assertio $62 million to settle a patent infringement lawsuit. The suit had been filed in 2013, alleging Purdue infringed on certain patents relating to OxyContin. The company has faced a number of lawsuits related to its marketing of the Nucynta opioid painkiller, with Assertio denying wrongdoing. In January 2019, an insurer had asked California federal courts if it had to cover Assertio's defense in opioid-related cases filed in approximately 38 different cases in 2018. In March 2019, Assertio won a dismissal of a lawsuit by shareholders that accused the company of hiding how much its growth was dependent on Nucynta marketing for off-label purposes. According to the judge, the plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of a scheme.

He also served as vice-minister of Public Security in China from 2004 to 2018. Meng purportedly resigned in absentia in October 2018 via Chinese officials after he was secretly detained and accused of taking bribes by Chinese anti-corruption authorities. On 21 January 2020, Meng had been sentenced to 13-and-a-half years in jail by a Chinese court for bribery during his time at the Chinese coast guard and Ministry of Public Security.  Early life and career  Meng was born in Harbin, Heilongjiang, in 1953. He entered the workforce in 1972 and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1975. He graduated from Peking University with a bachelor's degree in law and obtained a master's degree from Central South University. He has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing. He served as Vice-Minister of Public Security from 2004 until his arrest in 2018. He served as Director of the Maritime Police Bureau and Deputy Director of China's State Oceanic Administration from 2013 until 2017. In April 2018, without explanation, he was relieved of his membership of the Communist Party committee at the Ministry of Public Security. It was unclear whether this was due to his declining political fortunes or due to his age.  Interpol  In 2004, Meng became the head of Interpol's China branch. He was elected as President of Interpol on 10 November 2016, becoming the first Chinese head of the agency. His election was viewed as a success for China's ambitions to gain influence within international organisations. Dissidents feared that China would use Meng to track exiled opponents. During his presidency, the Chinese government submitted extensive lists of officials and business people wanted for questioning on allegations of corruption, which critics claimed were politically motivated. His term as president was due to last until 2020, but he resigned in October 2018 after being detained by Chinese authorities. Corruption accusations=Secret detention Meng left France on 20 September 2018, and landed in China on a flight from Stockholm on 25 September. The same day Meng sent his wife Grace an emoji of a knife, suggesting that he was in danger. The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, reported that Meng had been taken away for questioning by \\"discipline authorities\\" on his arrival in China. French newspaper Le Parisien added that he was under investigation in China, suspected of favouring a company in a cybersecurity procurement. On 4 October, Mrs. Meng reported her husband missing to the French police. She was given police protection after being threatened by phone and Internet. Mrs. Meng is now an asylum-seeker in France. Prosecution On 6 October 2018, Interpol officially demanded to know Meng's status from the Chinese government. The next day, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that Meng was being investigated by the National Supervisory Commission, an anti-corruption agency, for allegedly taking bribes, and that a task force would be set up to pursue his alleged associates. Meng was also accused of \\"willfulness\\", which public administration expert Zhu Lijia said might indicate that he \\"may not have strictly toed the party lines\\". Interpol also received Meng's letter of resignation, with immediate effect, and said the organisation's acting senior vice president, Kim Jong Yang of South Korea, would be acting president until a permanent replacement was elected at a meeting in Dubai in November 2018. Interpol's press release did not mention whether Meng had resigned under duress. Grace Meng has threatened Interpol with legal action over its lack of investigation into the authenticity of the resignation. On 26 October 2018, Meng was removed from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top political advisory body. On 27 March 2019, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission announced that Meng was expelled from the Communist Party and removed from all posts. On April 2019, Meng's wife sued Interpol for failing to assist her at the Permanent Court of Arbitration. On 24 April 2019, a statement by the Supreme People's Procuratorate said that prosecutors \\"decided to arrest Meng Hongwei on suspicion of accepting bribes\\". On 20 June 2019, he pleaded guilty for accepting bribes over 14.5 million yuan or $2.11 million dollars. He was sentenced on 21 January 2020 to 13½ years of jail time and fined CNY 2 million for the accepting of bribes and abusing his position. He did not apply for appeal to the court sentence.

As a monk of the Ramakrishna Order he took up service to the humanity as the most important philosophy in his life and practiced it for the benefit of the local population and the pilgrims. He spent thirty six years in Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama Kankhal to serve the poor and afflicted. He was one of the pioneers to set up a hospital in a remote location for the poor, needy and the itinerant monks who did not have access to healthcare. Pre-monastic life Kalyanananda was born as Dakshinaranjan Guha in the year 1874 in Hanua village near Vazirpur town in Barishal district of East Bengal province (now Bangladesh). His father's name was Umesh Chandra Guha. He lost his father at an early age and was educated under the guardianship of his uncle. Extreme poverty compelled him to give up a formal education. Monastic life Dakshinaranjan was inspired by the ideals of Vivekananda of leading a selfless life and service to poor and needy by looking upon them as manifestation of God. In 1898 he joined the newly established monastery of Ramakrishna Order, the Belur Math. He was initiated by Vivekananda and took his monastic vows under the name Kalyanananda. He served an ailing Yogananda, another direct disciple of Ramakrishna, in his death bed. Kalyanananda, a direct monastic disciple of Vivekananda In 1899 when Vivekananda left for West a second time, Kalyanananda went for pilgrimage and for practicing austerities. In Benares he met Kedarnath Moulik who would later become famous as Achalananda, another monastic disciple of Vivekananda and the founder of Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service Benares. Together they were involved in serving the poor and needy in Benares and Kalyanananda developed initial exposure to Vivekananda's vision of practical Vedanta through this. From Benares he went to Allahabad and got engaged in service activities. At Kishangarh in Jaipur, together with Swarupananda, another brother disciple, he got busy in providing relief to the local population affected by a famine. They fed about 300 people everyday which helped in alleviating the impact of the famine. In 1901 he returned to Belur Math to meet Vivekananda who had come back from West. Vivekananda had requested him to work for the sick and ailing monks around the Rishikesh- Haridwar region as he himself was the witness to the plight of the people there in absence of any healthcare facility.Genesis of Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama, Kankhal Vivekananda apparently told Kalyanananda, Kalyan, you will be a Paramhansa. Sarvagatananda of Vedanta Centre Providence, who as Brahmachari Narayan served Kalyanananda in Kankhal, used this statement as the title of the book on his reminiscences about Kalyanananda.Reminiscences of Swami Kalyanananda, by Swami Sarvagatananda, publisher Vedanta Press, USA, With the help of Swarupananda, Kalyanananda was able to raise some funds for beginning the work of the Sevashrama in Kankhal near Haridwar in a rented premise consisting of two rooms in 1901. He also met Vivekananda and served him before the latter's death. Once he bought 20 kg of ice by walking over a distance of 8 km for Vivekananda. Vivekananda had told him the essence of practical Vedanta was service to the humanity with spirituality as the mainstay. Kalyanananda followed this philosophy in practice by serving the patients as Gods or living manifestations of the divinity. Later he was joined in his work by another disciple of Vivekananda, Nischayananda. The two monks received enthusiastic support from Dhanraj Giri, the head of Kailash Ashrama monastery in Rishikesh, who had a good relationship with Vivekananda and Abhedananda. Because of the effort of Dhanraj Giri, the local monks began accepting the two disciples of Vivekananda as part of the fraternity. Along with service to the poor patients, the two swamis followed strict austere practices like begging their food from a satra or alms house so that they did not have to spend the funds available for personal expenses like food and clothing. Many monks of the Ramakrishna Order, including Brahmananda, Turiyananda and Shivananda, as well as householder disciples of Ramakrishna like Mahendranath Gupta, better known as \\"M\\", visited the Kankhal Sevashrama. Kalyanananda's daily routine consisted in personally visiting every patient in the hospital and get to know about the condition, sitting by their side and talking to them, visiting the kitchen, the wards, the garden, the cowshed, the library and the temple shrine. Last days Last fifteen years of his life was spent in a shattered health owing to the strain of the excessive work. He suffered from diabetes. In 1932 he traveled to Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati and also went to Mussoorie in 1937. He died on 20 October 1937 in Dehra Dun. Contribution In June 1901, Kalyanananda started the Sevashrama in rented huts at Kankhal with a few phials of medicine himself donned multiple roles as doctor, nurse, accountant and all. In 1903 the Mission was provided with funds for the purchase of a plot of land measuring along with a well for water supply, and in 1905 two permanent buildings were constructed on this land by the funds sponsored by Babus Bhajanlal Lohia and Harshima,Sukdevdas of Calcutta.The First General Report of Ramakrishna Mission in 1912, published by Saradananda, Secretary The Sevashrama which started modestly over the years developed into a full-fledged hospital with many different sections and departments. During the initial stages Kalyanananda and Nischayananda had to do everything, from picking up patients from roadside and bringing them to the hospital to serving them in every possible way. Because of financial constraints, they had to do even the menial work of cleaning the hospital and patients and for this they were looked down upon by the local monks. However this was eradicated through the efforts of Dhanraj Giri, the influential head of Kailash Ashrama, who knew Vivekananda and had great respect for him. In 1902, Kalyanananda opened a branch centre of the sevashrama in Rishikesh. He set up a small dispensary there where poor local people and pilgrims used to come for treatment.Reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda by Swami Bodhananda The two disciples of Vivekananda also provided service to the pilgrims during Kumbha Mela in Haridwar in 1903, 1915, and 1927. Kalyanananda also started a library for the public in 1905 for providing education to labourers and their children. He started a school in the colony of the scavengers and other backward classes. He also provided drinking water to people who lived nearby and personally gave monetary and pecuniary help to poor and needy. Vivekananda had asked Kalyanananda never to return to Bengal. Therefore he never went back to Belur Math despite repeated summonses. Kalyanananda's philosophy was to look upon the hospital as a place of worship and the patients as God. He would often wake up at night and accompanied by a faithful dog, went to pay a visit to the in-patient ward to check if anybody needed any service. He planted 150 mango trees in the premises of the hospitals and he used to feed the monks and poor with the produce. At least one person was known to have received regular monetary help from him. He himself used to sew the pillow covers and bed sheets of the patients in order to ensure an excellent quality of linen to them. He used to keep every affairs of the hospitals, esp. pertaining to the services delivered to the patients under minute observations and sometimes used to do all tasks himself, including cleaning, when his staff were not present.

Her designs were used by directors such as Isao Takahata, Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii. During a career spanning five decades in the animation industry, she worked on animated feature films and short films for theatrical release, original video animation (OVA), promotional music videos, animated television series, documentaries and commercials. Yasuda provided the colour designs for Miyazaki's Academy Award winning animated film Spirited Away. She officially retired after working on Ponyo in 2008, but worked on the Academy Award nominated animated feature The Wind Rises, released in July 2013. Early life Born in Tokyo's Nakano ward, Yasuda grew up in the Tokyo metropolitan area. For most of her childhood and adolescence she lived in Higashi-fushimi, a neighbourhood in what became Nishitōkyō city as of 2001. Her father was a university professor, and she grew up with an older brother, an older sister and three younger brothers. She has described her youth as very pleasant with a lot of freedom and mentioned getting encouragement to excel in any field. She received an education in culture and the arts at school and at home. When she was 14 years old her parents divorced. In November 1954 her father fell ill and, in spite of their divorce, was nursed by her mother until his death in March 1955. In April 1955 Yasuda enrolled in . Without the opportunity to continue into higher education she started looking for a job to support herself. Career Yasuda joined Toei Doga in April 1958, immediately after her graduation from high school. Yasuda has said that she applied not knowing what the job entailed but that she had submitted her application because she did not fancy employment in any of the other jobs available for most women at the time, such as bank teller or store clerk. Instead she took the opportunity to work in a creative field. She started out in the Toei finishing department, in the ink and paint section, where she worked on TV series and commercials as a tracer. In traditional animation a tracer is a person whose job involves transferring cleaned up line drawings onto the cels. Through her work and union activities at the company she made the acquaintance of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki whose careers also began at Toei, joining in 1959 and 1963 respectively. Yasuda also worked as a tracer on Hols: Prince of the Sun, directed by Takahata, for which Yasuo Ōtsuka was animation director and Miyazaki was one of the key animators. They built lasting working relationships that endured for over 40 years. After leaving Toei Yasuda next joined A Production followed by Nippon Animation where she worked in the finishing department on productions such as 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother. On the animated TV series Future Boy Conan, aired in Japan in 1978, she was in charge of colour selection for an entire project for the first time. This position involved her choosing colour for all the items and characters seen in motion throughout the animated work. In 1983 she worked for Top Craft in charge of colour design on the adaptation of Miyazaki's manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind into the animated feature film of the same title. The film was released in Japanese theaters on March 11, 1984. The collaborations culminated in the creation of Studio Ghibli in June 1985. Yasuda worked with Mamoru Oshii on his 1985 OVA Angel's Egg released in December 1985. She took charge of Studio Ghibli's colour department from its inception for the creation of the Castle in the Sky production and collaborated with various directors and animators in the creation of nearly all Studio Ghibli animation works until her retirement. She last worked on the feature films Ponyo and The Wind Rises and in between on the short Pandane to tamago hime for the Ghibli Museum. Throughout most of her career Yasuda worked on colour designs for animators who employed the use of inks and paints for their creations but she also worked with digital media and used software like Toonz for her craft. At Studio Ghibli, Yasuda decided colours in consultation with Miyazaki and let the depicted objects guide her choices, based on the availability of materials and dyes in the time period portrayed. Her choice of individual colours and a colour scheme was also determined based on the mood of each film, a particular scene and the personality of each individual character. In the Los Angeles Times Cristy Lytal observed: \\"For Yasuda, color is a storytelling tool that is every bit as powerful as words\\". In the article, Lytal quotes Yasuda, saying: \\"What I like best is when I am building up the colors in my head, thinking of how to get the tone worked out,\\" and \\"Color has a meaning, and it makes the film more easily understood.

Bluecap was a Cheshire foxhound that was famous for winning a race against the hounds of Hugo Meynell of the Quorn Hunt in 1763. The memorial is in sandstone and consists of an obelisk standing on a plinth, with a brass plaque inscribed with a poem. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Bluecap (or Blue Cap) was a foxhound owned by John Smith-Barry, son of the 4th Earl of Barrymore, and was a member of the first pack of foxhounds to be founded in Cheshire. The pack was housed in Forest Kennels, Speedwell Hill. In 1763 Smith-Barry was challenged to a bet by Hugo Meynell of the Quorn Hunt, one of the most influential men in the development of fox- hunting, to a race between two of each other's hounds. The race was held over a four-mile course at Newmarket. Meynell's hounds were favourites at odds of 7–4, but Bluecap won easily, and Bluecap's daughter, Wanton, came second. Bluebell became a legend in northwest England, outstripping the rest of the pack, and died at the age of 13 in 1772. Smith-Barry arranged for the memorial to be made, and it was initially erected at Speedwell Hill, being moved to its present position in the yard of the Cheshire Hunt Kennels in 1959. The sculptor of the memorial is unknown. Description The memorial is constructed in buff and pink sandstone, and stands high. It is surrounded by a low wall and railings. The memorial has square base, and consists of a square pier with a moulded plinth and cornice, which is surmounted by an obelisk. On the north face of the pier is a brass plate inscribed with details of the foxhound and its owner, followed by a poem, all in copperplate script. The inscription reads as follows: Other memorials Bluecap was a great favourite locally, and was painted at least twice. One of the paintings was commissioned by the Tarporley Hunt Club, and hangs in the Swan Hotel in Tarporley. Another painting was executed by Francis Sartorius in 1774. The foxhound is also commemorated in Ballads and Legends of Cheshire, written by Egerton Leigh in 1867, and the Blue Cap Inn in Sandiway is named after it. Appraisal The memorial was designated as a Grade II listed building on 18 July 1986.

History  The beginnings of the steel industry in Italy were strongly influenced by the modest presence of underground iron ore and coal in particular, that occurred in 1880, an increasing import of pig iron from abroad. With the widespread application of iron in the railways and in the mechanical industry in general witnessed the slow renewal of the old ironworks (with the adoption of Martin- Siemens furnaces and converters from scrap iron). The regions of Italy that contributed most to the expansion of production were Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont, Tuscany. In 1884 the Italian state, including the potential strategic role of the steel industry, built a large modern steel mill for that period at Terni. At the beginning of the 20th century, to improve the use of iron ore national and limit dependence on foreign, were built some coke furnaces for the production of cast iron: in Portoferraio (with the company Elba) in 1902, in Piombino and finally in Bagnoli. During this period, in 1905, the company ILVA was founded with the support of the Italian government, and acquired the management of the plants in Piombino, Savona, Elba, and later, of the largest plant of Bagnoli, to create a large group of steel production and construction of ships.

The Miꞌkmaw militias deployed effective resistance for over 75 years before the Halifax Treaties were signed (1760–61). In the nineteenth century, the Miꞌkmaq \\"boasted\\" that, in their contest with the British, the Miꞌkmaq \\"killed more men than they lost\\". In 1753, Charles Morris stated that the Miꞌkmaq have the advantage of \\"no settlement or place of abode, but wandering from place to place in unknown and, therefore, inaccessible woods, is so great that it has hitherto rendered all attempts to surprise them ineffectual\\". Leadership on both sides of the conflict employed standard colonial warfare, which included scalping non- combatants (e.g., families). After some engagements against the British during the American Revolution, the militias were dormant throughout the nineteenth century, while the Miꞌkmaw people used diplomatic efforts to have the local authorities honour the treaties. After confederation, Miꞌkmaw warriors eventually joined Canada's war efforts in World War I and World War II. The most well-known colonial leaders of these militias were Chief (Sakamaw) Jean- Baptiste Cope and Chief Étienne Bâtard. 16th century= Battle at Bae de Bic  According to Jacques Cartier, the Battle at Bae de Bic happened in the spring of 1534, 100 Iroquois warriors massacred a group of 200 Miꞌkmaq camped on Massacre Island in the St. Lawrence River. Bae de Bic was an annual gathering place for the Miꞌkmaq along the St. Lawrence. Miꞌkmaw scouting parties notified the village of the Iroquois attack the evening before the morning attack. They evacuated 30 of the infirm and elderly and about 200 Miꞌkmaq left their encampment on the shore and retreated to an island in the bay. They took cover in a cave on the island and covered the entrance with branches. The Iroquois arrived at the village in the morning. Finding it vacated, they divided into search parties but failed to find the Miꞌkmaq until the morning of the next day. The Miꞌkmaw warriors defended the tribe against the first Iroquois assault. Initially, after many had been wounded on both sides, with the rising tide, the Miꞌkmaq were able to repulse the assault and the Iroquois retreated to the mainland. The Mikmaq prepared a fortification on the island in preparation for the next assault at low tide. The Iroquois were again repulsed and retreated to the mainland with the rising tide. By the following morning, the tide was again low and the Iroquois made their final approach. They had prepared arrows that carried fire which burned down the fortification and wiped out the Miꞌkmaq. Twenty Iroquois were killed and thirty wounded in the battle. The Iroquois divided into two companies to return to their canoes on the Bouabouscache River.Cartier, second voyage, CL, IXÎle du Massacre, Rimouski, QC : Battle between Miꞌkmaq and Iroquois c. 1534  Battle at Bouabouscache River  Just prior to Battle at Bae de Bic, the Iroquois warriors had left their canoes and hid their provisions on the Bouabousche River, which the Miꞌkmaw scouts had discovered and recruited assistance from 25 Maliseet warriors. The Miꞌkmaw and Maliseet militia ambushed the first company of Iroquois to arrive at the site. They killed ten and wounded five of the Iroquois warriors before the second company of Iroquois arrived and the Miꞌkmaw/ Maliseet militia retreated to the woods unharmed. The Miꞌkmaw/Maliseet militia had stolen most of the Iroquois canoes. Leaving twenty wounded behind at the site, 50 Iroquois went to find their hidden provisions. Unable to find their supplies, at the end of the day they returned to the camp, finding that the 20 wounded soldiers that had stayed behind had been slaughtered by the Miꞌkmaw/Maliseet militia. The following morning, the 38 Iroquois warriors left their camp, killing twelve of their own wounded who would not be able to survive the long journey back to their village. Ten of the Miꞌkmaw/Maliseet stayed with the stolen canoes canoes and provisions while the remaining 15 pursued the Iroquois. The Miꞌkmaw/Maliseet militia pursued the Iroquois for three days, killing eleven of the wounded Iroquois stragglers.  Battle at Riviere Trois Pistoles  Shortly after the Battle at Bouabouscache River, the retreating Iroquois set up camp on the Riviere Trois Pistoles to build canoes to return to their village. An Iroquois hunting party was sent to hunt for food. The Miꞌkmaw/Maliseet militia killed the hunting party. The Iroquois went to find their missing hunting party and were ambushed by the Miꞌkmaw/Maliseet militia. They killed nine of the Iroquois, leaving 29 warriors who retreated to their camp on Riviere Trois Pistoles. The Miꞌkmaw/Maliseet militia divided into two companies and attacked the remaining Iroquois warriors. The battle left 3 Maliseet warriors dead and many others wounded. The Miꞌkmaw/Maliseet militia was victorious, however, killing all but six of the Iroquois, whom they took prisoner and later tortured and killed. (Cartier, second voyage, CL, IX)  Kwedech–Miꞌkmaq War  Tradition indicates that there was war in the 16th century between the Kwedech (the St. Lawrence Iroquois) and the Miꞌkmaq. The great Miꞌkmaw chief Ulgimoo led his people. The conflict was eventually settled through a peace treaty after the Miꞌkmaq were successful in removing the Kwedech out of the Maritimes.p.46 p.51 17th century A subgroup of Miꞌkmaq who lived in New England were known as Tarrantines. The Tarrantines sent 300 warriors to kill Nanepashemet and his wife in 1619 at Mystic Fort. The remaining family had been sent off to safe haven. Nanapashemet's death ended the Massachusetts Federation.  Penobscot–Tarrantine War  Before 1620, the Penobscot- Tarrantine War (1614–1615) (Tarrantine being the New England term for Miꞌkmaq) happened in current day Maine, in which the Pawtucket Tribe supported the former. This led later to retaliatory raids by the Tarrantines on the Pawtucket and Agawam (Ipswich) Tribes. In 1633 Tarrantines raid the camp of Chief Masconomet at Agawam in Essex County.  King Philip's War  The first documented warfare between the Miꞌkmaq and the British was during the First Abenaki War (the Maine/ Acadia theatre of King Philip's War), which was the Battle of Port La Tour (1677). In the wake of King Philip's War, the Miꞌkmaq became members of the Wapnáki (Wabanaki Confederacy), an alliance with four other Algonquian-language nations: the Abenaki, Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, and Maliseet. The Wabanaki Confederacy allied with French colonists in Acadia. Over a period of seventy-five years, during six wars in Miꞌkmaꞌki (Acadia and Nova Scotia), the Miꞌkmaq fought to keep the British from taking over the region. The first war where there is evidence of widespread participation of the Miꞌkmaw militias was King William's War. Prins, Harald E.L. The Mi'kmaq: Resistance, Accommodation and Cultural Survival, Fort Worth (Texas): Harcourt Brace, 1996, pp.123-129. King William's War Maliseet and Miꞌkmaw \\"attack on the [Maine] settlement\\" (c. 1690) During King William's War, the Miꞌkmaw militia participated in defending against the British migration toward Miꞌkmaki. They fought, with the support of their Wabanaki and French allies, the British along the Kennebec River in southern Maine which was the natural boundary between Acadia and New England. Toward this end, the Miꞌkmaw militia and the Maliseet operated from their headquarters at Meductic on the Saint John River. They joined the New France expedition against present-day Bristol, Maine (the Siege of Pemaquid (1689)), Salmon Falls and present-day Portland, Maine. Miꞌkmaq tortured the British prisoners taken during these conflicts and the Battle of Fort Loyal. In response, the New Englanders retaliated by attacking Port Royal and present-day Guysborough. In 1692, Miꞌkmaq from across the region participated in the Raid on Wells (1692). In 1694, the Maliseet participated in the Raid on Oyster River at present-day Durham, New Hampshire. Two years later, New France, led by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, returned and fought a naval battle in the Bay of Fundy before moving on to raid Bristol, Maine again. In the lead up to this battle in Fundy Bay, on July 5, 140 natives (Miꞌkmaq and Maliseet), with Jacques Testard de Montigny and Chevalier, from their location of Manawoganish island, ambushed the crews of four English vessels. Some of the English were coming ashore in a long boat to get firewood. A native killed five of the nine men in the boat. The Miꞌkmaq burned the vessel under the direction of Father Florentine (missionary to the Micmacs at Chignectou). In retaliation for the Siege of Pemaquid (1696) that followed, the New Englanders, led by Benjamin Church, engaged in a Raid on Chignecto (1696) and the siege of the Capital of Acadia at Fort Nashwaak. After the Siege of Pemaquid (1696), d'Iberville led a force of 124 Canadians, Acadians, Miꞌkmaq and Abenakis in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. They destroyed almost every English settlement in Newfoundland, over 100 English were killed, many times that number captured, and almost 500 deported to England or France.  18th century = Queen Anne's War  Raid on Grand Pré (1704) During Queen Anne's War, the Miꞌkmaw militias participated again in defending Miꞌkmaki against the migration of the British into the region. Again, they made numerous raids along the Acadia/ New England border. They made numerous raids on New England settlements along the border in the Northeast Coast Campaign. In retaliation for the Miꞌkmaw militia raids (and the Raid on Deerfield), Major Benjamin Church went on his fifth and final expedition to Acadia. He raided present-day Castine, Maine and then continued on by conducting raids against Grand Pre, Pisiquid and Chignecto. In the summer of 1705, Miꞌkmaq killed a fisherman gathering \\"wood off Cape Sables.\\" A few years later, defeated in the Siege of Pemaquid (1696), Captain March made an unsuccessful siege on the Capital of Acadia, Port Royal (1707). The New Englanders were successful with the Siege of Port Royal (1710), while the Wabanaki Confederacy were successful in the nearby Battle of Bloody Creek in 1711. During Queen Anne's War, the Conquest of Acadia (1710) was confirmed by the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713. Acadia was defined as mainland-Nova Scotia by the French. Present-day New Brunswick and most of Maine remained contested territory, while New England conceded Île St Jean and Île Royale; present-day Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton respectively, as French territory. On the latter island, the French established a fortress at Louisbourg to guard the sea approaches to Quebec. In 1712, the Miꞌkmaq captured over twenty New England fishing vessels off the coast of Nova Scotia. In 1715 the Miꞌkmaq were told that the British now claimed their ancient territory by the Treaty of Utrecht, in which the Miꞌkmaq were not involved. They formally complained to the French commander at Louisbourg about the French king transferring the sovereignty of their nation when he did not possess it. They were only then informed that the French had claimed legal possession of their country for a century, on account of laws decreed by kings in Europe. Native people saw no reason to accept British pretensions to rule Nova Scotia. There was an attempt by the British after the war to settle outside of Miꞌkmaw accommodation of the British trading posts at Canso and Annapolis. On May 14, 1715, New England naval commander Cyprian Southack attempted to create a permanent fishing station at a place he named \\"Cape Roseway\\" (now known as Shelburne). Shortly after he established himself, in July 1715 the Miꞌkmaq raided the station and burned it to the ground. In July 1715, two of the Boston merchants who had had their fishing vessels seized off Cape Sable by the Miꞌkmaq under renegade Joseph Mius reported that \\"the Indians say the Lands are theirs and they can make Warr and peace when they please....\\" In response, Southack led a raid on Canso, Nova Scotia (1718) and encouraged Governor Phillips to fortify Canso.  Father Rale's War  A Miꞌkmaw chief During the escalation that preceeded Father Rale's War (1722–1725), some Miꞌkmaq raided Fort William Augustus at Canso, Nova Scotia (1720). Under potential siege, in May 1722, Lieutenant Governor John Doucett took 22 Miꞌkmaq hostage at Annapolis Royal to prevent the capital from being attacked. In July 1722 the Abenaki and Miꞌkmaq created a blockade of Annapolis Royal, with the intent of starving the capital. The natives captured 18 fishing vessels and prisoners from present-day Yarmouth to Canso. They also seized prisoners and vessels from the Bay of Fundy. As a result of the escalating conflict, Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute officially declared war on July 22, 1722. The first battle of Father Rale's War happened in the Nova Scotia theatre. In response to the blockade of Annapolis Royal, at the end of July 1722, New England launched a campaign to end the blockade and retrieve over 86 New England prisoners taken by the natives. One of these operations resulted in the Battle at Jeddore. = Raid on Georgetown = On September 10, 1722, in conjunction with Father Rale at Norridgewock, 400 or 500 St. Francis (Odanak, Quebec) and Miꞌkmaq fell upon Georgetown (present-day Arrowsic, Maine). Captain Penhallow discharged musketry from a small guard, wounding three of the Indians and killing another. This defense gave the inhabitants of the village time to retreat into the fort. In full possession of the undefended village, the Indians killed fifty head of cattle and set fire to twenty-six houses outside the fort. The Indians then assaulted the fort, killing one New Englander. Georgetown was burned. That night Col. Walton and Capt. Harman arrived with thirty men, to which were joined about forty men from the fort under Captains Penhallow and Temple. The combined force of seventy men attacked the natives but were overwhelmed by their numbers. The New Englanders then retreated back into the fort. Viewing further attacks on the fort as useless, the Indians eventually retired up the river. During their return to Norridgewock the natives attacked Fort Richmond. Fort Richmond was attacked in a three-hour siege. Houses were burned and cattle slain, but the fort held. Brunswick and other settlements near the mouth of the Kennebec were burned. The next was a raid on Canso in 1723.Benjamin Church, p. 289 During the 1724 Northeast Coast Campaign, assisted by the Miꞌkmaq from Cape Sable Island, the natives also engaged in a naval campaign. In just a few weeks they had captured 22 vessels, killing 22 New Englanders and taking more prisoner. They also made an unsuccessful siege of St. George's Fort in Thomaston, Maine. In early July 1724 a militia of sixty Mikmaq and Maliseets raided Annapolis Royal. They killed and scalped a sergeant and a private, wounded four more soldiers, and terrorized the village. They also burned houses and took prisoners. The British responded by executing one of the Miꞌkmaw hostages on the same spot the sergeant was killed. They also burned three Acadian houses in retaliation. As a result of the raid, three blockhouses were built to protect the town. The Acadian church was moved closer to the fort so that it could be more easily monitored. In 1725, sixty Abenakis and Miꞌkmaq launched another attack on Canso, destroying two houses and killing six people. The treaty that ended the war marked a significant shift in European relations with the Miꞌkmaq and Maliseet. For the first time a European Empire formally acknowledged that its dominion over Nova Scotia would have to be negotiated with the region's indigenous inhabitants. The treaty was invoked as recently as 1999 in the Donald Marshall case.  King George's War  Siege of Louisbourg (1745) by Peter Monamy News of war declarations reached the French fortress at Louisbourg first, on May 3, 1744, and the forces there wasted little time in beginning hostilities, which would become known as King George's War. Within a week of the arrival of the news of war a military expedition to Canso was agreed upon, and on May 23 a flotilla left Louisbourg harbour. In this same month British Captain David Donahue of the Resolution took prisoner the chief of the Miꞌkmaw people of Ile Royale Jacques Pandanuques with his family to Boston and killed him. Donahue used the same strategy of posing as a French ship to entrap Chief Pandanuques as he does in the Naval battle off Tatamagouche, after which Donahue was tortured and killed by the Miꞌkmaq. Concerned about their overland supply lines to Quebec and seeking revenge for the death of their chief, the Miꞌkmaq and French first raided the British fishing port of Canso on May 23. In response Governor Shirley of Massachusetts declared war against the Miꞌkmaq and put a bounty out for their scalps. The Miꞌkmaq and French then organized an attack on Annapolis Royal, then the capital of Nova Scotia. However, French forces were delayed in departing Louisbourg, and their Miꞌkmaw and Maliseet allies decided to attack on their own in early July. Annapolis had received news of the war declaration, and was somewhat prepared when the Indians began besieging Fort Anne. Lacking heavy weapons, the Indians withdrew after a few days. Then, in mid-August, a larger French force arrived before Fort Anne, but was also unable to mount an effective attack or siege against the garrison, which was relieved by the New England company of Gorham's Rangers. Gorham led his native rangers in a surprise raid on a nearby Miꞌkmaw encampment. They killed and mutilated the bodies of women and children. The Miꞌkmaq withdrew and Duvivier was forced to retreat back to Grand Pre on October 5. During the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1745), the Miꞌkmaq and Maliseet took prisoner William Pote and some of Gorham's Rangers. Pote was taken to the Maliseet village Aukpaque on the Saint John River. While at the village, Miꞌkmaq from Nova Scotia arrived and, on July 6, 1745, tortured him and a Mohawk ranger from Gorham's company named Jacob, as retribution for the killing of their family members by Ranger John Gorham during the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744).Raymond, p. 42–43 On July 10, Pote witnessed another act of revenge when the Miꞌkmaq tortured a Mohawk ranger from Gorham's company at Meductic.Raymond, p. 45 = Naval battle off Tatamagouche = Naval Battle off Tatamagouche Many Miꞌkmaw warriors and French Officer Paul Marin de la Malgue were thwarted from helping to protect Louisbourg by Captain Donahew, who defeated them in the Naval battle off Tatamagouche (and had earlier killed the Miꞌkmaw chief of Cape Breton). In 1745, British colonial forces conducted the Siege of Port Toulouse (St. Peter's) and then captured Fortress Louisbourg after a siege of six weeks. Weeks after the fall of Louisbourg, Donahew and Fones again engaged Marin, who was now nearing the Strait of Canso. Donahew and 11 of his men put ashore and were immediately surrounded by 300 Indians. The captain and five of his men were slain and the remaining six were taken prisoner. The Indians were said to have cut open Donahew's chest, sucked his blood, then eaten parts of him and his five companions. This tale significantly heightened the sense of gloom and frustration settling over the fortress. On July 19, the 12-gun provincial cruiser of Donavan's the Resolution sailed slowly into the harbour with her colours flying at half- mast. The horrifying tale of the fate of her captain, David Donahew, and five crew members spread rapidly through the fortress. Miꞌkmaw fighters remained outside Louisbourg, striking at those who went for firewood or food. In response to the Siege of Louisbourg (1745), Miꞌkmaw warriors engage in the Northeast Coast Campaign (1745). The Campaign began when, on July 19, Miꞌkmaq from Nova Scotia, Maliseet and some from St. Francois attacked Fort St. George (Thomaston) and New Castle. They set fire to numerous buildings; killed cattle and took one villager captive. They also killed a person at Saco.Folsom, p. 243 In 1745, Miꞌkmaq killed 7 English crew at LaHave, Nova Scotia and brought their scalps to Sieur Marin. The English did not dry any fish on the east coast of Acadia for fear of being killed by the Miꞌkmaq. By the end of 1745, French reports were clear that, \\"the English have been deterred from forming any settlement in Acadia solely by the dread of these Indians\\" and that the French see themselves under native \\"protection\\". France launched a major expedition to recover Acadia in 1746. Beset by storms, disease, and finally the death of its commander, the Duc d'Anville, it returned to France in tatters without reaching its objective. The disease of the crew, in turn, spread throughout the Miꞌkmaw tribes killing hundreds. = Newfoundland = In response to the Newfoundland Campaign (1744), the following year the Miꞌkmaw militia from Ile Royal raiding various British outposts in Newfoundland in August 1745. They attacked several British houses, taking 23 prisoners. The following spring the Miꞌkmaq began to take 12 of the prisoners to a rendez-vous point close to St. John's, en route to Quebec. The British prisoners managed to kill their Miꞌkmaw captors at the rendez-vous site near St. John. Two days later, another group of Miꞌkmaq took the remaining 11 British prisoners to the same rendez-vous point. Discovering the fate of the Miꞌkmaw captors, the other Miꞌkmaq killed the remaining 11 British prisoners.  Father Le Loutre's War  Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Miꞌkmaq. To prevent the establishment of Protestant settlements in the region, Miꞌkmaq raided the early British settlements of present-day Shelburne (1715) and Canso (1720). A generation later, Father Le Loutre's War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749. By unilaterally establishing Halifax, historian William Wicken asserts the British were violating earlier treaties with the Miꞌkmaq (1726), which were signed after Father Rale's War. The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Miꞌkmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (Citadel Hill) (1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754). There were numerous Miꞌkmaw and Acadian raids on these villages such as the Raid on Dartmouth (1751). Within 18 months of establishing Halifax, the British also took firm control of peninsula Nova Scotia by building fortifications in all the major Acadian communities: present-day Windsor (Fort Edward); Grand Pre (Fort Vieux Logis) and Chignecto (Fort Lawrence). (A British fort already existed at the other major Acadian centre of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Cobequid remained without a fort.) There were numerous Miꞌkmaw and Acadian raids on these fortifications. = Raid on Dartmouth = Plaque to Raid on Dartmouth (1749) and the blockhouse that was built in response (1750), Dartmouth Heritage Museum The Miꞌkmaq saw the founding of Halifax without negotiation as a violation of earlier agreements with the British. On September 24, 1749, the Miꞌkmaq formally declared their hostility to the British plans for settlement without more formal negotiations. On September 30, 1749, about forty Miꞌkmaq attacked six men, who were under the command of Major Gilman, who were in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia cutting trees near a saw mill. Four of them were killed on the spot, one was taken prisoner and one escaped. Two of the men were scalped and the heads of the others were cut off. Major Gilman and others in his party escaped and gave the alarm. A detachment of rangers was sent after the raiding party and cut off the heads of two Miꞌkmaq and scalped one. This raid was the first of eight against Dartmouth during the war. = Siege of Grand Pre = Two months later, on November 27, 1749, 300 Miꞌkmaq, Maliseet, and Acadians attacked Fort Vieux Logis, recently established by the British in the Acadian community of Grand Pre. The fort was under the command of Captain Handfield. The Native and Acadian militia killed the sentrys (guards) who were firing on them. The Natives then captured Lieutenant John Hamilton and eighteen soldiers under his command, while surveying the fort's environs. After the British soldiers were captured, the native and Acadian militias made several attempts over the next week to lay siege to the fort before breaking off the engagement. Gorham's Rangers was sent to relieve the fort. When he arrived, the militia had already departed with the prisoners. The prisoners spent several years in captivity before being ransomed. There was no fighting over the winter months, which was common in frontier warfare. = Battle at St. Croix = \\"Battle Hill\\", St. Croix, Nova Scotia The following spring, on March 18, 1750, John Gorham and his Rangers left Fort Sackville (at present day Bedford, Nova Scotia), under orders from Governor Cornwallis, to march to Piziquid (present day Windsor, Nova Scotia). Gorham's mission was to establish a blockhouse at Piziquid, which became Fort Edward, and to seize the property of Acadians who had participated in the Siege of Grand Pre. Arriving at about noon on March 20 at the Acadian village of Five Houses beside the St. Croix River, Gorham and his men found all the houses deserted. Seeing a group of Miꞌkmaq hiding in the bushes on the opposite shore, the Rangers opened fire. The skirmish deteriorated into a siege, with Gorham's men taking refuge in a sawmill and two of the houses. During the fighting, the Rangers suffered three wounded, including Gorham, who sustained a bullet in the thigh. As the fighting intensified, a request was sent back to Fort Sackville for reinforcements. Responding to the call for assistance on March 22, Governor Cornwallis ordered Captain Clapham's and Captain St. Loe's Regiments, equipped with two field guns, to join Gorham at Piziquid. The additional troops and artillery turned the tide for Gorham and forced the Miꞌkmaq to withdraw. Gorham proceeded to present-day Windsor and forced Acadians to dismantle their church—Notre Dame de l'Assomption—so that Fort Edward could be built in its place. = Raids on Halifax = British Soldier of the 29th Regiment of Foot (right) guarding Halifax, Nova Scotia against Miꞌkmaw raids There were four raids on Halifax during the war. The first raid happened in October 1750, while in the woods on peninsular Halifax, Miꞌkmaq scalped two British people and took six prisoner: Cornwallis' gardener, his son were tortured and scalped. The Miꞌkmaq buried the son while the gardener's body was left behind and the other six persons were taken prisoner to Grand Pre for five months. Another author, Thomas Akins, puts the month of this raid in July and writes that there were six British attacked, two were scalped and four were taken prisoner and never seen again. Shortly after this raid, Cornwallis learned that the Miꞌkmaq had received payment from the French at Chignecto for five prisoners taken at Halifax as well as prisoners taken earlier at Dartmouth and Grand Pre. In 1751, there were two attacks on blockhouses surrounding Halifax. Miꞌkmaq attacked the North Blockhouse (located at the north end of Joseph Howe Drive) and killed the men on guard. Miꞌkmaq also attacked near the South Blockhouse (located at the south end of Joseph Howe Drive), at a sawmill on a stream flowing out of Chocolate Lake into the Northwest Arm. They killed two men. = Raids on Dartmouth = British erect a wooden palisade along Dartmouth in response to the Raid, opposite side of the harbour from the Great Pontack (Lower left corner), present-day Historic Properties There were six raids on Dartmouth during this time period. In July 1750, the Miꞌkmaq killed and scalped 7 men who were at work in Dartmouth. In August 1750, 353 people arrived on the Alderney and began the town of Dartmouth. The town was laid out in the autumn of that year. The following month, on September 30, 1750, Dartmouth was attacked again by the Miꞌkmaq and five more residents were killed. In October 1750 a group of about eight men went out \\"to take their diversion; and as they were fowling, they were attacked by the Indians, who took the whole prisoners; scalped ... [one] with a large knife, which they wear for that purpose, and threw him into the sea ...\\" The following spring, on March 26, 1751, the Miꞌkmaq attacked again, killing fifteen settlers and wounding seven, three of which would later die of their wounds. They took six captives, and the regulars who pursued the Miꞌkmaq fell into an ambush in which they lost a sergeant killed. Two days later, on March 28, 1751, Miꞌkmaq abducted another three settlers. Two months later, on May 13, 1751, Broussard led sixty Miꞌkmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the \\"Dartmouth Massacre\\". Broussard and the others killed twenty settlers—mutilating men, women, children and babies—and took more prisoner. A sergeant was also killed and his body mutilated. They destroyed the buildings. Captain William Clapham and sixty soldiers were on duty and fired from the blockhouse. The British killed six Miꞌkmaw warriors, but were only able to retrieve one scalp that they took to Halifax. Those at a camp at Dartmouth Cove, led by John Wisdom, assisted the settlers. Upon returning to their camp the next day they found the Miꞌkmaq had also raided their camp and taken a prisoner. All the settlers were scalped by the Miꞌkmaq. The British took what remained of the bodies to Halifax for burial in the Old Burying Ground. Douglas William Trider list the 34 people who were buried in Halifax between May 13 – June 15, 1751; four of whom were soldiers. In 1752, the Miꞌkmaw attacks on the British along the coast, both east and west of Halifax, were frequent. Those who were engaged in the fisheries were compelled to stay on land because they were the primary targets. In early July, New Englanders killed and scalped two Miꞌkmaw girls and one boy off the coast of Cape Sable (Port La Tour, Nova Scotia). In August, at St. Peter's, Nova Scotia, Miꞌkmaq seized two schooners—the Friendship from Halifax and the Dolphin from New England—along with 21 prisoners who were captured and ransomed. On September 14, 1752, Governor Peregrine Hopson and the Nova Scotia Council negotiated the 1752 Peace Treaty with Jean-Baptiste Cope. (The treaty was signed officially on November 22, 1752.) Cope was unsuccessful in getting support for the treaty from other Miꞌkmaw leaders. Cope burned the treaty six months after he signed it. Despite the collapse of peace on the eastern shore, the British did not formally renounce the Treaty of 1752 until 1756. = Attack at Mocodome (Country Harbour) = On February 21, 1753, nine Miꞌkmaq from Nartigouneche (present-day Antigonish, Nova Scotia) in canoes attacked a British vessel at Country Harbour, Nova Scotia. The vessel was from Canso, Nova Scotia and had a crew of four. The Miꞌkmaq fired on them and drove them toward the shore. Other natives joined in and boarded the schooner, forcing them to run their vessel into an inlet. The Miꞌkmaq killed and scalped two of the British and took two others captive. After seven weeks in captivity, on April 8, the two British prisoners killed six Miꞌkmaq and managed to escape. Stephen Patterson reports the attack happened on the coast between Country Harbour and Tor Bay. Whitehead reports the location was a little harbour to the westward of Torbay, \\"Martingo\\", \\"port of Mocodome\\". Beamish Murdoch in An History of Nova-Scotia, or Acadie, Volume 1 identifies Mocodome as present-day \\"Country Harbour\\". The Miꞌkmaq claimed the British schooner was accidentally shipwrecked and some of the crew drowned. They also indicated that two men died of illness while the other killed the six Miꞌkmaq despite their hospitality. The French officials did not believe the Miꞌkmaw account of events. The Miꞌkmaw account of this attack was that the two English died of natural causes and the other two killed six of the Miꞌkmaq for their scalps. = Attack at Jeddore = In response, on the night of April 21, under the leadership of Chief Jean- Baptiste Cope and the Miꞌkmaq attacked another British schooner in a battle at sea off Jeddore, Nova Scotia. On board were nine British men and one Acadian (Casteel), who was the pilot. The Miꞌkmaq killed and scalped the British and let the Acadian off at Port Toulouse, where the Miꞌkmaq sank the schooner after looting it. In August 1752, the Miꞌkmaq at Saint Peter's seized the schooners Friendship of Halifax and Dolphin of New England and took 21 prisoners who they held for ransom. = Raid on Halifax = In late September 1752, Miꞌkmaq scalped a man they had caught outside the Palisade of Fort Sackville.(Halifax Gazette September 30, 1752) In 1753, when Lawrence became governor, the Miꞌkmaq attacked again upon the sawmills near the South Blockhouse on the Northwest Arm, where they killed three British. The Miꞌkmaq made three attempts to retrieve the bodies for their scalps. On the otherside of the harbour in Dartmouth, in 1753, there were reported only to be five families, all of whom refused to farm for fear of being attacked if they left the confines of the picketed fence around the village. In May 1753, Natives scalped two British soldiers at Fort Lawrence. Throughout 1753, French authorities on Cape Breton Island were paying Miꞌkmaw warriors for the scalps of the British. = Raid on Lawrencetown = Michael Francklin taken captive by Miꞌkmaq (1754) In 1754, the British unilaterally established Lawrencetown. In late April 1754, Beausoleil and a large band of Miꞌkmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown. They arrived in mid-May and in the night open fired on the village. Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers. By August, as the raids continued, the residents and soldiers were withdrawn to Halifax.Diane Marshall. Heroes of the Acadian Resistance. Formac. 2011. p. 110–111 By June 1757, the settlers had to be withdrawn completely again from the settlement of Lawrencetown because the number of Native raids eventually prevented settlers from leaving their houses. Prominent Halifax business person Michael Francklin was captured by a Miꞌkmaw raiding party in 1754 and held captive for three months.  French and Indian War  St. John River Campaign: A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grimross (present day Gagetown, New Brunswick) by Thomas Davies in 1758. This is the only contemporaneous image of the Expulsion of the Acadians. The final colonial war was the French and Indian War. The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour. During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians and Miꞌkmaw militias posed within Nova Scotia but particularly to the northern New England border in Maine. The British wanted to prevent future attacks from the Wabanaki Confederacy, French and Acadians on the northern New England border. (There was a long history of these attacks from Acadia—see the Northeast Coast Campaigns 1688, 1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, 1747.) The British saw the Acadians' allegiance to the French and the Wabanaki Confederacy as a military threat. Father Le Loutre's War had created the conditions for total war; British civilians had not been spared and, as Governor Charles Lawrence and the Nova Scotia Council saw it, Acadian civilians had provided intelligence, sanctuary, and logistical support while others had fought against the British. Within Acadia, the British also wanted to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia. Defeating Louisbourg, would also mean defeating the ally which provided the Miꞌkmaq ammunition to fight. The British began the Expulsion of the Acadians with the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755). Over the next nine years over 12,000 Acadians were removed from Nova Scotia. (book in French and English) The Acadians were scattered across the Atlantic, in the Thirteen Colonies, Louisiana, Quebec, Britain and France. Very few eventually returned to Nova Scotia. During the various campaigns of the expulsion, the Acadian and Native resistance to the British intensified. During the expulsion, French Officer Charles Deschamps de Boishébert led the Miꞌkmaq and the Acadians in a guerrilla war against the British.John Gorham. The Far Reaches of Empire: War In Nova Scotia (1710–1760). University of Oklahoma Press. 2008. p. 177–206 According to Louisbourg account books, by late 1756, the French had regularly dispensed supplies to 700 Natives. From 1756 to the fall of Louisbourg in 1758, the French made regular payments to Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and other natives for British scalps. = Raids on Annapolis (Fort Anne) = Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot The Acadians and Miꞌkmaq fought in the Annapolis region. They were victorious in the Battle of Bloody Creek (1757). Acadians being deported from Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia on the ship Pembroke rebelled against the British crew. After fighting off an attack by another British vessel on February 9, 1756, the Acadians took 8 British prisoners to Quebec. In December 1757, while cutting firewood near Fort Anne, the Miꞌkmaw warriors captured John Weatherspoon and carried him away to the mouth of the Miramichi River. From there he was eventually sold or traded to the French and taken to Quebec, where he was held until late in 1759 and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, when General Wolfe's forces prevailed. About 50 or 60 Acadians who escaped the initial deportation are reported to have made their way to the Cape Sable region (which included south western Nova Scotia). From there, they participated in numerous raids on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Oral history indicates that a Samuel Rogers led a massacre against a Miꞌkmaw village at Rogers Point (present-day Point Prim), Digby in the autumn of 1759. Daniel Paul (2006) and Jon Tattrie (2013) have repeated the account as historical fact. Paul has described it as the \\"Last overt act of genocide committed by the English against Nova Scotia's Miꞌkmaq\\". The story is said to have originated from someone who participated in the raid under the leadership of Samuel Rogers. The oral history indicates that Rogers was an active member of the famous Rogers' Rangers and of equal stature to George Scott. This Samuel Rogers is also said to be the same one who was later a member of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia for Sackville (present-day Sackville, New Brunswick). These descriptions of Samuel Rogers leave the credibility of the story in serious doubt. Samuel Rogers and this expedition could not have been related to Rogers' Rangers because there were no Rogers' Rangers in Nova Scotia in the autumn of 1759. There were only four companies of Rogers' Rangers to ever fight in the colony and they departed on June 6, 1759 and were never in the western region of the colony. As well, had there been a military officer of equal stature to George Scott in the colony, certainly there would be official records that support his existence, when there is not. The Samuel Rogers of the oral tradition could not be the same Samuel Rogers who was later a member of the House of Assembly in 1775 (who was famous for becoming a leader in the Siege of Fort Cumberland). This Samuel Rogers was never connected to Rogers' Rangers and he died in 1831. Had he lived until he was age 90, he would have only been age 18 when he reached George Scott's stature and led the charge on the village. = Raids on Piziquid (Fort Edward) = In the April 1757, a band of Acadian and Miꞌkmaq raided a warehouse near Fort Edward, killing thirteen British soldiers. After loading with what provisions they could carry, they set fire to the building. A few days later, the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland. Because of the strength of the Acadian militia and Miꞌkmaw militia, British officer John Knox wrote that \\"In the year 1757 we were said to be Masters of the province of Nova Scotia, or Acadia, which, however, was only an imaginary possession … \\" He continues to state that the situation in the province was so precarious for the British that the \\"troops and inhabitants\\" at Fort Edward, Fort Sackville and Lunenburg \\"could not be reputed in any other light than as prisoners.\\" = Raids on Chignecto (Fort Cumberland) = Fort Monckton (1756) - oldest known military gravestones in the Maritimes The Acadians and Miꞌkmaq also resisted in the Chignecto region. They were victorious in the Battle of Petitcodiac (1755). In the spring of 1756, a wood-gathering party from Fort Monckton (former Fort Gaspareaux), was ambushed and nine were scalped. In the April 1757, after raiding Fort Edward, the same band of Acadian and Miꞌkmaw partisans raided Fort Cumberland, killing and scalping two men and taking two prisoners. On July 20, 1757, Miꞌkmaq killed 23 and captured two of Gorham's rangers outside Fort Cumberland near present-day Jolicure, New Brunswick. In March 1758, forty Acadian and Miꞌkmaq attacked a schooner at Fort Cumberland and killed its master and two sailors. In the winter of 1759, the Miꞌkmaq ambushed five British soldiers on patrol while they were crossing a bridge near Fort Cumberland. They were ritually scalped and their bodies mutilated as was common in frontier warfare. During the night of April 4, 1759, using canoes, a force of Acadians and French captured the transport. At dawn they attacked the ship Moncton and chased it for five hours down the Bay of Fundy. Although the Moncton escaped, its crew suffered one killed and two wounded. Others resisted during the St. John River Campaign and the Petitcodiac River Campaign. = Raids on Lawrencetown = Eastern Battery Plaque, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia By June 1757, the settlers had to be withdrawn completely from the settlement of Lawrencetown (established 1754) because the number of Indian raids eventually prevented settlers from leaving their houses. On July 30, 1757, Miꞌkmaw fighters killed three Roger's Rangers at Lawrencetown. A History of the Cutter Family of New England By Benjamin Cutter, p. 68 In nearby Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, in the spring of 1759, there was another Miꞌkmaw attack on Eastern Battery, in which five soldiers were killed. = Raids on Maine = In present-day Maine, the Miꞌkmaq and the Maliseet raided numerous New England villages. At the end of April 1755, they raided Gorham, Maine, killing two men and a family. Next they appeared in New-Boston (Gray) and through the neighbouring towns destroying the plantations. On May 13, they raided Frankfort (Dresden), where two men were killed and a house burned. The same day they raided Sheepscot (Newcastle), and took five prisoners. Two were killed in North Yarmouth on May 29 and one taken captive. They shot one person at Teconnet. They took prisoners at Fort Halifax; two prisoners taken at Fort Shirley (Dresden). They took two captive at New Gloucester as they worked on the local fort. On August 13, 1758, Boishebert left Miramichi, New Brunswick with 400 soldiers, including Acadians which he led from Port Toulouse. They marched to Fort St George (Thomaston, Maine) and Munduncook (Friendship, Maine). While the former siege was unsuccessful, in the latter raid on Munduncook, they wounded eight British settlers and killed others. This was Boishébert's last Acadian expedition. From there, Boishebert and the Acadians went to Quebec and fought in the Battle of Quebec (1759). = Raids on Lunenburg = Raid on Lunenburg (1756) by Donald A. Mackay The Acadians and Miꞌkmaq raided the Lunenburg settlement nine times over a three-year period during the war. Boishebert ordered the first Raid on Lunenburg (1756). In response to the raid, a week later, on May 14, 1756, Governor of Nova Scotia Charles Lawrence put a bounty on Miꞌkmaw scalps. Following the raid of 1756, in 1757, there was a raid on Lunenburg in which six people from the Brissang family were killed. The following year, the Lunenburg Campaign (1758) began with a raid on the Lunenburg Peninsula at the Northwest Range (present-day Blockhouse, Nova Scotia) when five people were killed from the Ochs and Roder families. By the end of May 1758, most of those on the Lunenburg Peninsula abandoned their farms and retreated to the protection of the fortifications around the town of Lunenburg, losing the season for sowing their grain. For those that did not leave their farms for the town, the number of raids intensified. Miꞌkmaq take Marie Anne Payzant (far right) captive with her children During the summer of 1758, there were four raids on the Lunenburg Peninsula. On July 13, 1758, one person on the LaHave River at Dayspring was killed and another seriously wounded by a member of the Labrador family. The next raid happened at Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia on August 24, 1758, when eight Miꞌkmaq attacked the family homes of Lay and Brant. While they killed three people in the raid, the Miꞌkmaq were unsuccessful in taking their scalps, which was the common practice for payment from the French. Two days, later, two soldiers were killed in a raid on the blockhouse at LaHave, Nova Scotia. Almost two weeks later, on September 11, a child was killed in a raid on the Northwest Range. Another raid happened on March 27, 1759, in which three members of the Oxner family were killed. The last raid happened on April 20, 1759. The Miꞌkmaq killed four settlers at Lunenburg who were members of the Trippeau and Crighton families. = Raids on Halifax = On April 2, 1756, Miꞌkmaq received payment from the Governor of Quebec for 12 British scalps taken at Halifax. Acadian Pierre Gautier, son of Joseph-Nicolas Gautier, led Miꞌkmaw warriors from Louisbourg on three raids against Halifax in 1757. In each raid, Gautier took prisoners or scalps or both. The last raid happened in September and Gautier went with four Miꞌkmaq and killed and scalped two British men at the foot of Citadel Hill. (Pierre went on to participate in the Battle of Restigouche.) Arriving on the provincial vessel King George, four companies of Rogers' Rangers (500 rangers) were at Dartmouth April 8 until May 28 awaiting the Siege of Louisbourg (1758). While there they scoured the woods to stop raids on the capital. Despite the presence of the Rangers, in April the Miꞌkmaq returned 7 prisoners and 16 scalps to Louisbourg. In July 1759, Miꞌkmaq and Acadians kill five British in Dartmouth, opposite McNabb's Island. = Siege of Louisbourg (1758) = Acadian militias participated in the defense of Louisbourg in 1757 and 1758. In preparation of a British assault on Louisbourg in 1757, all the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy were present including Acadian militia. Without any result from their efforts, the number of Miꞌkmaq and Acadians who showed the following year were much lower. The precedent for such a decline in numbers was set in the two attacks that happened in the Siege of Annapolis 1744, the Miꞌkmaq and Acadians appearing in much less numbers for the second assault after the first one had failed. New Englanders came ashore at Pointe Platee (Flat Point) during the Siege of 1745. In 1757 and again in 1758, the Natives and Acadian militias were stationed at the potential landing beaches of Pointe Platee and one further away Anse d la Cormorandiere (Kennington Cove). In the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), Acadian and Miꞌkmaw militias began to arrive in Louisboug around May 7, 1758. By the end of the month 118 Acadians arrived and about 30 Miꞌkmaq from Ile St. Jean and the Miramachi. Boishebert arrived in June with 70 more Acadia militia members from Ile St. Jean and 60 Miꞌkmaw militia. On June 2, The British vessels arrived and the militias went to their defensive positions on the shore. The 200 British vessels waited for six days, until the weather conditions were right, before they attacked on June 8. Four companies of Rogers' Rangers under the command of George Scott were the first to come ashore in advance of James Wolfe. The British came ashore at Anse de la Cormorandiere and \\"continuous fire was poured upon the invaders\\". The Miꞌkmaw and Acadian militias fought the Rangers until the latter were supported by Scott and James Wolfe, which led to the militias retreat. Seventy of the militia were captured and 50 others scalped. The Miꞌkmaw and Acadian militias killed 100 British, some of whom were wounded and drowned. On June 16, 50 Miꞌkmaq returned to the cove and took 5 seaman captive, firing at the other British marines. On July 15 Boishebert arrived with Acadian and Miꞌkmaw militias and attacked Captain Sutherland and the Rogers' Rangers posted at Northeast harbour. When Scott and Wolfe's reinforcements arrived, 100 Rangers from McCurdey and Brewer's Companies were sent to track them down. They only captured one Miꞌkmaw. (From here the Rangers went on to conduct the St. John River Campaign, in part, hoping to capture Boishebert.) = Battle at St. Aspinquid's Chapel = Site of the battle at St. Aspinquid's Chapel (Chain Rock Battery, Point Pleasant Park, Nova Scotia) Tradition indicates that at St. Aspinquid's Chapel in Point Pleasant Park, Halifax, Lahave Chief Paul Laurent and a party of eleven invited Shubenacadie Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and five others to St. Aspinquid's Chapel to negotiate peace with the British. Chief Paul Laurent had just arrived in Halifax after surrendering to the British at Fort Cumberland on 29 February 1760. In early March 1760, the two parties met and engaged in armed conflict. Chief Larent's party killed Cope and two others, while Chief Cope's party killed five of the British supporters. Shortly after Cope's death, Miꞌkmaw chiefs signed a peace treaty in Halifax on 10 March 1760. Chief Laurent signed on behalf of the Lahave tribe and a new chief, Claude Rene, signed on behalf of the Shubenacadie tribe. (During this time of surrender and treaty making, tensions among the various factions who were allied against the British were evident. For example, a few months after the death of Cope, the Miꞌkmaw militia and Acadian militias made the rare decisions to continue to fight in the Battle of Restigouche despite losing the support of the French priests who were encouraging surrender.) = Battle of Restigouche = An Acadian militia and Miꞌkmaw militia, totalling 1500 militia, organized in the Battle of Restigouche. The Acadians arrived in about 20 schooners and small boats. Along with the French, they continued up river to draw the British fleet closer to the Acadian community of Pointe-à-la-Batterie, where they were ready to launch a surprise attack on the English. The Acadians sunk a number of their vessels to create a blockade, upon which the Acadian and Miꞌkmaq fired at the ships. On 27 of June, the British succeeded in maneuvering just beyond the chain of sunken ships. Once the British were range of the battery, they fired on the battery. This skirmish lasted all night and was repeated with various breaks from June 28 to July 3, when the British overwhelmed Pointe à la Batterie, burning 150 to 200 buildings which made up the Acadian village community at Pointe à la Batterie. The militias retreated and re-grouped with the French frigate Machault. They sunk more schooners to create another blockade. They created two new batteries, one on the South shore at Pointe de la Mission (today Listuguj, Quebec), and one on the North shore at Pointe aux Sauvages (today Campbellton, New Brunswick). They created blockade with schooners at Pointe aux Sauvages. On July 7, British commander Byron spent the day getting rid of the battery at Pointe aux Sauvages and later returned to the task of destroying the Machault. By the morning of July 8, the Scarborough and the Repulse were in range of the blockade and face to face with the Machault. The British made two attempts to defeat the batteries and the militias held out. On the third attempt, they were successful.  Halifax Treaties  Pierre Maillard, Negotiator for the Miꞌkmaq, Plaque, St. Mary's Basilica (Halifax), Nova Scotia (He is reported to be buried on the grounds of St. Paul's Church (Halifax)) The Mí'kmaq signed a series of peace and friendship treaties with Great Britain. The first was after Father Rale's War (1725). The nation historically consisted of seven districts, which was later expanded to eight with the ceremonial addition of Great Britain at the time of the 1749 treaty. Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope signed a Treaty of 1752 on behalf of the Shubenacadie Miꞌkmaq. After agreeing to several peace treaties, the seventy-five year period of war ended with the Halifax Treaties between the British and the Miꞌkmaq (1760-1761). (In commemoration of these treaties, Nova Scotians annually celebrate Treaty Day on October 1.) Despite the treaties, the British continued to build fortifications in the province (see Fort Ellis and Fort Belcher). Historian's differ on the meaning of the Treaties. HIstorian Stephen Patterson indicates that the Halifax Treaties established a lasting peace on the basis that the Miꞌkmaq surrendered and chose to uphold the rule of law through the British courts rather than resorting to violence. Patterson reports that the Miꞌkmaq were not in a position of military strength after the defeat of the French. He argues that without a supply of guns and ammunition, the Miꞌkmaq lost their ability to fight and to hunt for food. As a result, the British were able to define themselves the terms of the Treaties. Patterson identifies the Halifax Treaties define the relationship between the Miꞌkmaq and the British. While the Treaties do not stipulate the laws governing land and resources, the treaties ensured that both parties would follow the laws that would eventually be made to deal with these matters and any other matters. The British, accepted a continuing role for existing Miꞌkmaw polities within the limits of British sovereignty.\\"Patterson, p. 51 Historian John G. Reid dismisses the Treaties language about Miꞌkmaw \\"submission\\" to the British crown, he believes that the Miꞌkmaw intended a friendly and reciprocal relationship. He asserts his interpretation is based on what is known of the surrounding discussions, combined with the strong evidence of later Miꞌkmaw statements. The Miꞌkmaw leaders who represented their people in the Halifax negotiations in 1760 had clear goals: to make peace, establish secure and well-regulated trade in commodities such as furs, and begin an ongoing friendship with the British crown. In return, they offered their own friendship and a tolerance of limited British settlement, although without any formal land surrender. To fulfill the reciprocity intended by the Miꞌkmaq, Ried argues that any additional British settlement of land would have to be negotiated, and accompanied by giving presents to the Miꞌkmaq. (There was a long history of Europeans giving Miꞌkmaw people presents to be accommodated on their land, starting with the first colonial contact.) The documents summarizing the peace agreements failed to establish specific territorial limits on the expansion of British settlements, but assured the Miꞌkmaq of access to the natural resources that had long sustained them along the regions' coasts and in the woods. Their conceptions of land use were quite different. The Miꞌkmaq believed they could share the land, with the British growing crops, and their people hunting as usual and getting to the coast for seafood.  American Revolution  As the New England Planters and United Empire Loyalists began to arrive in Mi'kmaki (the Maritimes) in greater numbers, economic, environmental and cultural pressures were put on the Miꞌkmaq with the erosion of the intent of the treaties. The Miꞌkmaq tried to enforce the treaties through threat of force. At the beginning of the American Revolution, many Miꞌkmaw and Maliseet tribes were supportive of the Americans against the British. The Treaty of Watertown, the first foreign treaty concluded by the United States of America after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, was signed on July 19, 1776, in the Edmund Fowle House in the town of Watertown, Massachusetts Bay. The treaty established a military alliance between the United States and the St. John's and Miꞌkmaw First Nations in Nova Scotia—two of the peoples of the Wabanaki Confederacy—against Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War. (These Mí'kmaw delegates did not officially represent the Miꞌkmaw government, although many individual Miꞌkmaq did privately join the Continental army as a result.) Months after signing the treaty, they participated in the Maugerville Rebellion and the Battle of Fort Cumberland in November 1776. During the St. John River expedition, Col. Allan's untiring effort to gain the friendship and support of the Maliseet and Miꞌkmaq for the Revolution was somewhat successful. There was a significant exodus of Maliseet from the St John River to join the American forces at Machias, Maine.Hannay, p. 119 On Sunday, July 13, 1777, a party of between 400 and 500 men, women, and children, embarked in 128 canoes from the Old Fort Meduetic ( below Woodstock) for Machias. The party arrived at a very opportune moment for the Americans, and afforded material assistance in the defence of that post during the attack made by Sir George Collier on August 13–15. The British did only minimal damage to the place, and the services of the Indians on the occasion earned for them the thanks of the council of Massachusetts.Rev. W. O. Raymond In June 1779, Miꞌkmaq in the Miramichi attacked and plundered some of the British in the area. The following month, British Captain Augustus Harvey, in command of , arrived in the area and battled with the Miꞌkmaq. One Miꞌkmaw was killed and 16 were taken prisoner to Quebec. The prisoners were eventually brought to Halifax, where they were later released upon signing the Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown on July 28, 1779.Sessional papers, Volume 5 By Canada Parliament July 2 – September 22, 1779 19th century Miꞌkmaq Veteran's Legacy Project, Headquarters, Nova Scotia Museum As their military power waned in the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Miꞌkmaw people made explicit appeals to the British to honour the treaties and reminded them of their duty to give \\"presents\\" (i.e., rent) to the Miꞌkmaq in order to occupy Miꞌkmaꞌki. In response, the British offered charity or, the word most often used by government officials, \\"relief\\". The British said the Miꞌkmaq must give up their way of life and begin to settle on farms. Also, they were told they had to send their children to British schools for education. 20th century National Aboriginal Veterans Monument In 1914, over 150 Miꞌkmaw men signed up during World War I. During the First World War, thirty-four out of sixty-four male Miꞌkmaq from Lennox Island First Nation, Prince Edward Island enlisted in the armed forces, distinguishing themselves particularly in the Battle of Amiens. In 1939, World War II began and over 250 Miꞌkmaq volunteered. In 1950, over 60 Miꞌkmaq enlisted to serve in the Korean War. The Treaties, which the Miꞌkmaw militias fought for during the colonial period, did not gain legal status until they were enshrined into the Canadian Constitution in 1982.

Early years Fabre was born in Montreal in 1867. He was the son of Hector Fabre (1834–1910) of Montreal, a French Canadian lawyer, journalist, diplomat and senator, and Flora Stein of Arthabaska, Quebec. His father was appointed Canada's first General Agent in Paris, holding office from 1882 until his death in 1910. Fabre was aged 15 when he accompanied his parents to Paris. Fabre became an actor and theatre critic. In 1887 he founded Gardénia, a theatrical and artistic circle. Gardénia included many members of Le Chat Noir, such as Alphonse Allais, George Auriol, Paul Delmet, Jean-Louis Dubut de Laforest, Hugues Delorme, Georges Fragerolle and Georges Courteline. The comedian and singer Pierre Trimouillat also became a member. Paris-Canada In February 1892 Fabre was appointed editorial secretary of the journal Paris-Canada, and two years later was made editor. Paris-Canada had been founded in 1882 with offices in Montreal, Quebec and Paris, with the purpose of making Canada well known in France, and France better known in Canada. Paris-Canada had a sophisticated Rive Droite flavor, covering Montmartre, the Grands Boulevards and the Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin. It included sections on literature, music and the theatre. In 1896 Fabre said that Paris-Canada reflected ideas, sentiments and interests of both sides of the Atlantic. He stressed that the practical goal of promoting business ties between the two countries was of great importance. However, the journal had little commercial influence compared to its significant cultural impact. Quebec Commissariat On 2 October 1896, at his father's recommendation, the Canadian government appointed Fabre secretary to the Commissariat of the Province of Quebec in Paris with a salary of $500. His father's salary was reduced by the same amount. Fabre transformed the Commissariat of Quebec into a cultural center that influenced the whole artistic community of Paris. However, his health was poor. Fabre died on 18 December 1902 at the age of 35.

He previously served as head coach of the Finnish national ice hockey team, and of the Espoo Blues and Oulun Kärpät of the Liiga. Career Marjamäki is notable for becoming a pro coach at a relatively young age, having only played a couple of seasons' worth of junior hockey semi- professionally before turning to coaching. After working the youth ranks of Finnish clubs Ilves and Espoo Blues, he joined the coaching staff of the Blues’ men's squad as an assistant in 2007. In 2011, he was promoted to the head coaching job and remained in that position until February 2013. Marjamäki took over the reins at fellow Liiga club Oulun Kärpät prior to the 2013-14 season and coached the team to back-to-back Finnish championships in 2014 and 2015. After grabbing the 2015 title, he won the Kalevi Numminen trophy as the Liiga Coach of the Year. Marjamäki has been head coach of the Finnish KHL team, Jokerit, since 2018.  National team coaching  Marjamäki was named as a Team Finland assistant coach under Erkka Westerlund for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia and also served as an assistant coach at the 2014 and 2015 World Championships, winning silver in 2014. Marjamäki was announced as the next head coach of the Finnish national team in August 2015 and he began in position in 2016, succeeding the previous head coach, Kari Jalonen. Team Finland’s first tournament with Marjamäki at the helm was the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, where the Finns placed last of eight. The team placed third in the 2016–17 Euro Hockey Tour and fourth at the 2017 IIHF World Championship in Cologne and Paris. In August 2017, Marjamäki announced that he would not take the +2 year option available in his contract, despite the Finnish Ice Hockey Association being open to the extension, and would leave the position at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season. In his second season leading behind the bench, the team were champions of the 2017–18 Euro Hockey Tour, winning both the 2017 Karjala Tournament and 2018 Sweden Hockey Games and placing third at the 2017 Channel One Cup and a respectable second at the 2018 Carlson Hockey Games. At the men's ice hockey tournament of the 2018 Winter Olympics, a loss to Canada in the quarterfinals prevented the Finns from progressing to fourth position or higher, ultimately placing sixth. The 2018 IIHF World Championship was Marjamäki’s last major tournament with the national team. Finland finished at the top of Group B, a group which included perennial heavyweights Canada and the United States, as well as recent silver-medal winners Germany.

The club house was designed by Henning Larsen Architects. The location - previously a clay pit and for the latest 60 years - a military practice area, is situated just north of Farum, Furesø Municipality, Denmark Construction The golf courses are located in the former training grounds of Farum Barracks. It was established by three passionate Danish golfers, who bought the 200+ hectare area in 2002. After four years of negotiating with the local community RTJ II with president and principal designer Bruce Charlton spent the following four years to develop two sand capped golf courses with more than 100 km of drainage, 2000 irrigation heads all fed from surface water in large lakes on just 25 percent of the exceptional area packed with fauna og flora. Rain will not stop play as the drain will carry away up to 100 millimeters of water per hour. The facilities Old Course opened in 2010 and New Course followed one year later. Golf Digest, USA, have recently analyzed 206 countries in the world to find the best courses, and in Denmark New Course is ranked #1 and Old Course #2. Golf World, UK, states that The Scandinavian is the only golf venue in Europe with both courses ranked in Top 50. Besides the courses there is a driving range with the possibility of playing in different wind directions. A large short game area is located next to covered bays with TrackMan gear free of use for the Members of the club. Four large putting greens is accessible close to the first and 10th teeboxes of both courses. The award-winning club house stands on a small plateau.

It has been in existence in various locations since 1997. The organization presents more than 300 events, classes and performances each year attended by over 24,000 patrons annually. TCAN was established as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 1997.  History  In 1997, founding director Michael Moran envisioned a coffeehouse venue in Natick Center, serving as a center of cultural and social interaction and an informal club for artists and regular members. Leasing a small storefront at 31 Main Street in Natick Center with a seating capacity of 60 patrons, TCAN hosted frequent open mic programs for local songwriters, a weekly jazz jam, small community theatre productions and visual art exhibits by local artists. In time more programs were added including a regular all-ages rock concert featuring teen bands, a classical music series and family performances for young children. The organization relied extensively on volunteers to provide staffing for events and drive marketing/fundraising activities.  Relocation to Natick Central Fire Station  The success of TCAN in its original location encouraged the organization to seek a larger and more permanent facility. After considering alternate locations, TCAN purchased the historic Central Fire Station from the Town of Natick in October 1998. Originally constructed in 1875 following a devastating fire in 1874, the Central Fire Station is located in the heart of Natick Center and is recognized in the National Register of Historic Places. A $2.5M restoration of the building included installation of a steel beam to allow use of 4,000 sq. ft. for the main performance space, reconstruction of the historic cupola that sits atop the hose drying tower, restoration of windows and masonry, installation of a new roof, and the return of the modified two double-bay entrances to the original four arched bays, complete with opening wood doors. The new TCAN facility, with four times as much seating capacity (270 seats), was opened in May 2003.  Management and Volunteers  In March 2004, shortly after relocation to the larger venue, TCAN's Board of Directors hired David Lavalley as its new Executive Director. The decision to part ways with founding director Michael Moran was met with local controversy and the departure of some volunteers, who protested his termination. TCAN is governed by an elected volunteer Board of Directors, run by a staff of full-time and part-time employees and supported by over 175 volunteers. TCAN relies on volunteers to produce events, staff its box office and support all facets of marketing, fundraising and operations.  Mission and Programs  TCAN is unique in providing a wide variety of programming, ranging from nationally known touring musicians to local performers, theatre, comedy, arts education classes and family programs. TCAN added a Cinema Room presenting art house movies in 2016. Featured Performances - Concerts feature well-known musicians and bands spanning folk, blues, contemporary, rock, jazz, fusion and classical music. See List of Notable Performances. Art House Cinema - Screenings of classic films and new releases including feature films, documentaries. TCAN Players - TCAN is home to its own community theatre troupe, who present three productions each year. Auditions are open to the public. TCAN Players, including their productions, cast and crew have been nominated and received DASH awards by the Eastern Massachusetts Association of Community Theatres. Folk Open Mic - A bi-weekly Open Mic event for singer-songwriters and musicians of all genres. Young Masters Series - A classical music series dedicated to presenting talented young classical musicians from around the world.  Strategic Partnerships  TCAN has initiated strategic partnerships to strengthen programming and expand its audience. In 2008, TCAN and the Danforth Museum in Framingham, Massachusetts announced a strategic partnership to enhance program offerings and benefits for members of their respective organizations. In 2013, TCAN and the Walnut Hill School in Natick, Massachusetts announced a partnership to share resources, facilities and expertise to advance their respective missions, enhance the Natick Center Cultural District, while also creating long-term sustainability for each organization. In partnership with Natick Service Council, South Middlesex Opportunities Council and United Way of TriCounty, TCAN offers a program called Smile in Every Seat that provides free access to TCAN’s programming for economically disadvantaged people and families in Natick and surrounding communities.

He is a social and political activist and a researcher of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and peace process. Baskin founded IPCRI in March 1988 and served as its Co-Director until January 2012. Baskin is am award winning columnist for The Jerusalem Post. His weekly column is also published in Arabic in the Jerusalem Al Quds daily newspaper and in Hebrew on the website: https://www.dyoma.co.il. He describes himself as a social and political entrepreneur. Baskin's writings and video recordings are archived on his website: http://gershonbaskin.com  Biography  In his youth, Baskin became involved in the civil rights movement and the anti–Vietnam War movement. In 1978, Baskin received his BA from New York University in the politics and history of the Middle East. He received his MA (1992) and Ph.D. (1994) from Greenwich University. His Ph.D. dissertation was on \\"Sovereignty and Territory in the Future of Jerusalem:, In September 1978, he made aliyah (immigrated to Israel) under the auspices of the Interns for Peace program. From 1979 to 1981 he was a community worker in Kafr Qara, a Palestinian Arab village in Israel. In 1982, Baskin served in the Israeli Ministry of Education as coordinator of education for co-existence between the Jewish and Arab school systems. In 1983, under the auspices of the Prime Minister's office and the Ministry of Education, Baskin founded and directed the Institute for Education for Jewish Arab Coexistence, which was funded by the Hanns Seidel Foundation. In March 1988, Baskin founded IPCRI - Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information and served as its co- director until January 2012. In mid-1989, Baskin launched three Israeli- Palestinian working groups: Economics and Business, the Future of Jerusalem, and the water experts working group. In October 1992, Baskin initiated a series of secret meetings in London with former Israeli security officers and Palestinian officials from the PLO. These talks laid down the framework for subsequent security undertaking in the Oslo Accords of September 1993. In 1994, Baskin became an outside adviser on the peace process to a secret team of intelligence officers established by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In 24 years as Co-Director of IPCRI, together with Zakaria al Qaq (for 14 years) and with Mr. Hanna Siniora (for 10 years), Baskin organised, led, facilitated, negotiated and mediated more than 2000 working group meetings of Israeli and Palestinian professionals covering every subject imaginable connecting Israeli and Palestinian societies. The subjects included: security, border management, economy and business, agriculture, regional tourism, water, environment, peace education and more. Baskin, together with other Israelis and Arabs, had worked for years to secure peace between Israelis and Arabs and had many Arab contacts. Baskin is a certified mediator (Gishur Israel) and also certified by Prof. Lawrence Susskind, Director Public Dispute Program Harvard Law School, in the Theory and Practice of Third Party Intervention in Intractable International Conflicts. Baskin also completed a 200 hour course through the Consensus Building Institute (Cambridge Ma.) Negotiation and Mediation Training for Environmental Professionals.  Baskin and Gilad Shalit  In July 2006, six days after Gilad Shalit was abducted in Gaza, Baskin unofficially opened a back channel with Hamas. Three months later Baskin successfully got Hamas to deliver a hand written letter from Shalit to his parents which was brought to the Office of the Egyptian Government in Gaza. He continued his behind the scenes efforts to negotiate a deal between Israel and Hamas throughout the five years and four months that Shalit was in captivity. He became the official intermediary between senior Hamas officials and Israeli envoy David Meidan in April 2011. Baskin's main interlocutor in Hamas was Deputy Foreign Minister Ghazi Hamad. Baskin was involved in efforts to secure Shalit's release for more than five years. Baskin's efforts are detailed in his book The Negotiator: Freeing Gilad Schalit from Hamas.  Continued talks with Hamas  Immediately after Shalit's return, Baskin and Hamad began discussing the possibility of negotiating a long-term ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. On 1 May 2012, Baskin presented the fourth draft of the proposed agreement to Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Barak formed a high level committee, composed of officials from the security establishment, to discuss the proposal. After two months, the committee decided against entering into a formal agreement with Hamas even if, as proposed, it were negotiated and formalized through the Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate. In October 2012, Baskin initiated another round of talks to reach a ceasefire—this time with Ahmed Jabari, the head of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, through Hamad. In November 2012, Baskin and Hamad met in Cairo, where they spoke with Egyptian intelligence officers and discussed possible long-term ceasefire arrangements. On 14 November 2012, Hamad met with Jabari and was planning to send a copy of a proposed ceasefire agreement to Baskin but later that day Israel killed Jabari in an air strike and started Operation Pillar of Defense. Baskin and Hamad remain in contact.  Baskin after IPCRI  Since stepping down as co-director of IPCRI on 31 December 2011, Baskin became the co-chairman of the Board of IPCRI until April 2018. He remains a member of the Board of IPCRI. He was a member of the steering committee of the Israeli Palestinian Peace NGO Forum until 2016, a member of the Board of Directors of ALLMEP – the Alliance for Middle East Peace, also until 2016, and was a member of the Israeli Board of One Voice Movement.

Faller's work has been shown in a range of exhibitions, is held in various public collections and she has received fellowships from a number of institutions. Life and work Faller was born Marion Sudol in Passaic, New Jersey. She studied at Hunter College before earning a Masters of Fine Art from the University of Buffalo in the photographic studies program at Visual Studies Workshop. Eventually, she returned to the University of Buffalo where she taught studio and history of photography courses from 1982 to 2006. In addition, she taught at Colgate University, Hunter College and Marymount Manhattan College. She often collaborated with her husband, experimental filmmaker Hollis Frampton, before his death in 1984. In later years, her photographs focused on the ways in which regular people, often New Yorkers, reflect their identities in inventive displays in and around their domestic spaces. Faller major series were Hey Baby, Take My Picture (1972-1975); Second Flora (1977-1979); Vegetable Locomotion (1978); False Impressions (1979); Time Capsule (1979–81) and Neither Nor (1988). “My work is about how individuals and communities visually express their values, their interests, and their sense of what is important and beautiful. The subject matter is usually close to home—homes, yards, small businesses and community buildings such as schools or churches. While much of my photography addresses the various ways we celebrate holidays and respond to the changing seasons, I've been photographing flags and other patriotic displays since October 2001. I am trying to document both the ordinary and the extraordinarily inventive ways people are approaching the ritual of displaying the flag— following established traditions and creating new ones. Most of my photographs were made in New York (where I’ve spent most of my adult life) and in New Jersey (where I grew up).” Hollis Frampton said of Faller’s work that it is “ambitions: aesthetically, philosophically, politically... Best of all, the wit and grace with which it is joined make her work entirely unique.” Gina Murtagh praised her “flexibility in charting the quirks of human nature…” In 2002, she participated in the online project \\"Flagging Spirits\\", hosted by the University of Massachusetts. Faller acted as a juror for Light Work, Central New York Photography Grants in 1990. She also acted as a panelist for the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) between 1981-1985. Faller continued her work with the NYSCA, serving as vise-chair between 1982-1983 and chair to the Guidelines Committee in 1984-1985. She was a founding member of Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse New York, and of Soho Photo Gallery. She was a member of Society for Photographic Education and is a gallery artist of Visual Studies Workshop Gallery.

He is the director of Chôros Laboratoryhttp://choros.epfl.ch/page-13739-fr.html and of the Doctoral Program in Architecture and Science of the City.http://phd.epfl.ch/edar He is the cofounder of the scientific journal EspacesTemps.net (). He published in French, along with Michel Lussault, the dictionary of geography and space of societies, Dictionnaire de la géographie et de l’espace des sociétés.He has contributed to in the epistemological and theoretical reform of geography as a science of the spatial dimension of the social, open to the social sciences and philosophy. Starting from political geography, he has most notably explored the city, urbanity, Europe and globalization. He works also for the introduction of non-verbal languages, especially audio-visual languages, at all levels of research. In 2013 he made a feature film, Urbanity/ies, which is intended as a manifesto for scientific film.  Biography  Jacques Lévy being awarded the 2018 Vautrin Lud Prize. Born in Paris in 1952, Jacques Lévy got his geography Agrégation [national competitive examination] at the University of Paris VII in 1974. In 1975, he became co-founder and coordinator of the editorial board of the magazine EspacesTemps. In 1984, he was hired by the CNRS as a researcher and obtained his PhD in 1993 with a thesis in political geography on legitimate space. In 1993, he was named university professor at Reims. He was a senior lecturer and then professor at l'Institut d 'études politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) from 1999 to 2007 and has been a visiting professor at the University of New York, Los Angeles (UCLA), Naples (IUO), São Paulo (USP), Mexico (Cátedra Reclus), Sydney (Macquarie University), Bergamo (Università degli Studi di Bergamo), Liège (ULiège) and a fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (2003-2004). Since 2001, he has sevred as an advisor to the French Ministry of research. He is co-director of the free social science journal EspacesTemps.net and of the L’espace en société collection at the Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes.He has been nominated for the Grand Prix International de l’Urbanisme (2017). A political geography specialist, he has conducted numerous research missions on urbanity in cities in North and South countries, and is an active participant in the debate on cities, regional development and the relationship between space and politics, Europe and globalization.  Major theoretical contributions  Jacques Lévy's work concerns the spatial dimension of societies, with a focus on political spaces. He developed a new approach on geography in his most comprehensive book L’espace légitime in which he analyzes the geographic dimension of the political function. His researches on the legitimate scale of politics include works on the city, France, Europe and the World. The notion of urbanity is also central in his work. He also supports the relevance of using non verbal languages as scientific means for researchers, especially cartography and cinema.https://vimeo.com/84507071 He is the director of a scientific film named Urbanity/ies. Conducted in interdisciplinary groups, his research focuses on such topics as urban models, mobility, the micro-geography of public spaces and the extent of globalization in metropolitan areas. His work also embraces sociology, anthropology, architecture and human geography, skillfully combining both theory and the realization of concrete projects. Within the Direction à l'aménagement du territoire et à l'action régionale (DATAR) in Paris, he has notably developed practices of participatory mapping that seek to fully involving the populations concerned.  Epistemology of geography and the theory of the social  He has actively been involved in the epistemological and theoretical reform of geography since as 1975, arguing that the latter is defined as the study of the spatial dimension of the social. The inclusion of geography in the “common trunk of social sciences” led him to develop “realistic constructivism,” a general epistemology, starting in 1994 and then in 1999. The latter seeks to make the best use of the constructivist approach (knowledge is invention) while asserting the specificity of the regime of truth of the scientific project as the cognitive goal. He likewise built a social theory based on “dialogic systemism,” i.e. a vision of society as a whole that is sensitive to the action of the actors within it and which diverges from both structuralism and methodological individualism. In the 2000s and 2010s he continued in the same vein, introducing an actor/object/environment triptych that made it possible to take into account the contributions of an “actor turn” in thinking on non-human agents, and generalize the concept of environment by refusing to limit social aggregates to \\"assemblages.\\" He is part of an informal network that includes several French-speaking geographers, including Christian Grataloup, Denis Retaillé, Michel Lussault, Mathis Stock, Olivier Lazzarotti, Anne Volvey, Boris Beaude and Marc Dumont, as well as English, Italian, German and Portuguese geographers and non-geographers, including sociologists, political scientists, historians, cartographers, planners and developers.  Theory of space  Since 1994, one of Jacques Lévy's main contributions is the formalization of a theory of social space, most notably through the building of a vocabulary that reworks basic concepts while making them coherent. The definition of space as a set of relationships of distance, in a Leibnizian perspective, helps in escaping Newtonian and Cartesian absolutism and identifying the two major attributes of space (metrics and scale) in close connection with that which, in social reality, is not spatial (substance). The territory/network, topography/topology and place/area duos, as well as his work on “interspatialities” (interaction, co-presence, nesting and “synchorization”) complete the basic glossary that the Dictionary of geography and space of the societes developed with the contributions of more than one hundred authors representative of contemporary social sciences of space. Space as an environment and spatiality as an action thus appear to be the basis of \\"geographicity\\" thus redefined. Since 2001, Lévy has revisited the concept of dwelling based on a re- historicized integration of the contributions of Martin Heidegger, in which there is tension between space and spatiality, that is, between enclosing but fragile environments and enclosed but strategic actors.  Political geography  As early as 1984, in analyzing the municipal elections in Paris, he showed the existence of a political space that was not reducible to the distribution of social groups defined on the basis of socio-economic criteria. His doctoral thesis focused on the intersection of the two dimensions of the social: the political and the spatial. The resulting book, L’Espace Légitime, is an exploration of the junction of these dimensions. First, it clarifies the concepts of politics regulated within a society by legitimacy versus geopolitics regulated between societies through violence. Moreover, the empirical corpus largely consists of French election results since World War II. Since 1997, this analytical work has been supplemented by numerous electoral studies on the France, Switzerland, the European Union and the United States, often published in newspapers and scientific journals. It appears that, when questions of openness (to Europe, migrants, religions or minority sexual orientations) arise, the electoral space is highly sensitive to gradients of urbanity. Central areas of large cities are often favorable to such otherness while those in peri-urban areas and smaller towns are more reticent or even hostile.  The city and urbanity  Starting 1983, he began work on the city which would gradually become a general theory of urbanity. The concept of urbanity, based on the multidimensional combination of density and diversity, allows for a convergence of all the work of the social sciences on the city. This makes it possible to overcome morphological tropisms and break from the historical European matrix to study the urbanization process and the dynamics of urban societies without bias. He shows that, in developed countries and soon throughout the world, urbanization is ending. Distinctions between rural and urban are giving way to internal differences of the urban world, which he calls gradients of urbanity. In the tradition of Henri Lefebvre and Jane Jacobs, he stresses the fact that urbanity is a social reality, a developmental horizon and a political issue as such, challenging economistic and communitarian approaches like those of the North American Marxists, and instead claiming the relevance of space as an interpretive lens of urbanity. This led him to criticize the use of the concept - in itself questionable - of \\"gentrification\\" to describe processes that increase social diversity in a neighborhood. Regarding urban planning practices, he is developing a theory of public space as a multi-scale concentrate of urbanity, where intimacy unfolds not less than in the private sphere, and wherein a way of doing politics based essentially on interaction and civility functions. The concept of public space (öffentlicher Raum), though separated from the more general one of public sphere (Kant and Habermas's Öffentlichkeit) convergence with works hitherto little connected: those of Norbert Elias on the society of individuals, those of Erving Goffman on interactions in public and those of Lyn Lofland on the “public realm.” He highlighted the role of serendipity as a particularly effective creative force in the public space. He has also incorporated mobility into his thinking by linking transport with the issue of public space and encouraging researchers to give greater consideration to walking. With François Ascher and Sylvain Allemand he organized a conference at Cerisy in 2003 and edited Les sens du mouvement, Belin, 2004. At the EPFL, he works in collaboration with sociologist Vincent Kaufmann on mobility issues. He currently heads the PostCarWorld network research program (2014-2016), which brings together a multidisciplinary group of Swiss researchers to propose sociological, geographical, architectural and technical simulations of a world without cars. This conceptual work is fueled by numerous field studies, particularly in the world's largest cities. He has developed a method based on free exploration of urban environments, mostly on foot, to facilitate comparisons by the body, and the scales and metrics of different cities. It is in this regard that his work is in the tradition of those of Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin, Guy Debord and Michel de Certeau. A feature film, Urbanité/s, produced by the Chôros laboratory in 2013, sums up in images the entire approach, while at the same time being intended as a manifesto of scientific cinema. He has criticized certain schools of thought in North American geography and sociology, led most notably by David Harvey and Neil Smith, for their inability to take into account the profound nature of urbanity by reducing it to a clash between communities or economic or political domination. He has characterized this movement, with its strong activist focus combining Marxism and culturalism and promoting the defense of the homogeneity of the slums, as \\"neo-structuralist,\\" whereas for Jacques Lévy, urban development should aim for sociological and functional diversity. From these theoretical and empirical explorations he concludes that the debate on desirable urbanity has becomes polarized around two models of urbanity: one is the “Amsterdam model,” which accepts urbanity and the exposure to otherness this implies, while the other - the “Johannesburg model” - rejects it, accepting urbanity only reluctantly by seeking to privatize everything that can be privatized. According to him, the first model, if adopted by inhabitants, tends to produce a “collected city” one finds mainly in large city centers in Europe and Asia. The second model, on the other hand, produces the \\"scattered and fragmented urbanity\\" often found in small towns and city outskirts in North America and Africa.  Globalization and World-society  Since 1991 and his work - first didactic, then theoretical - with Marie- Françoise Durand and Denis Retaillé, he has developed a theory of globalization using four \\"explanatory models\\" (the world as a collection of worlds, the world as a force field, the world as a hierarchical network and the world as a society), each of which considers a dimension of today's world but not all of its reality. This means that, since 1996, he has insisted that the challenge of the contemporary phase is the construction of a World- society. In the collective work L’invention du Monde, which he edited in 2008, he linked various components of today's world (including the Earth as one of the \\"natures of humanity\\") and suggested a periodization of globalization in seven phases, the first being the spread of Homo sapiens across the planet. By analyzing recent events, he confirmed the impossibility of explaining the current dynamics using only geopolitical or economic logics, as well as the need to observe the emergence of a society of individuals at the global scale through the appropriate \\"lenses.\\" In Europe: A geography he laid out the main concepts of geography, including those he tested at the global scale, to approach the highly complex space that is Europe through its history and geography.  Cartography  Since 2002 and in a more systematic way in 2004, he identified a gap between what he calls a “geographical turn” and the state of mapping. Since 1994 he has sought to use innovative mapping languages but came to the conclusion that only a “geographical turn” could connect the spatial language of maps with the theoretical demands of geography and the evolution of the world, most notably characterized by mobility, the emergence of individual spatial actors and globalization—some of the many challenges of traditional mapping. One of the evolutionary paths he explores is the broadening of the range of cartographic techniques and semiotics to escape from a \\"Euclidean prison,\\" which cannot correctly process both cities and the global scale. More specifically, he developed the use of cartograms by developing the software ScapeToad, an auto-extensive (i.e. without background) and animation map, with his team. In the Chôros laboratory, he regularly produces both maps and theoretical reflection on mapping, drawing on history as well as other mapping techniques (e.g. non-Western schools, maps from stateless societies and from contemporary art). In 2016, he edited a comprehensive synthesis about the different aspects of this “cartographic turn”.  Spatial justice and France  His interest in France as a unique space has always been obvious in his work through urban issues. He then connected the latter with his analyses of political space. Since 1996 he has been the scientific advisor for the journal Pouvoirs locaux, and contributes to French society's debate on the organization and governance of its territories. Similarly, he has participated, as a researcher, in many of the projects and studies led by the French institution DATAR - which became CEGET (Commissariat général à l’égalité des territories - general Commission for equality of the Territories) in 2014. More recently, he has been reworking a problem originally launched in 19941 – that of spatial justice, dealing with the concept in general and applying it to France specifically. On this point his approach differs from Ed Soja's neo-structuralist one by proposing a view of spatial justice based on urbanity, inhabiting and the co-production of public goods. In 2013 he published Réinventer la France, which takes stock of the end of urbanization and stipulates the idea - already put forth by Pierre Veltz and Jean Viard - of an archipelago society, to be understood here as a series of urban areas that resemble one another more so than their hinterlands, and whose differences are internal to them, by gradients of urbanity. In this book, he shows that the gap between the reality of the French space and the map of political territories is not only archaic but also unjust. Hence, his reflection is on spatial justice that addresses territorial divisions, taxation, urban planning, and public health and education policies. He concludes that space and the issues surrounding it (urbanity, mobility, dwelling, etc.) should be addressed with a view to co-producing public goods with inhabitants. In the same spirit, he has participated in the debate on \\"territorial reform\\" initiated by the Government in 2014.

Designed by Johan Otto von Spreckelsen, the rectangular building of aerated concrete was completed and consecrated in 1969. Architecture St Nikolaj Church was von Spreckelsen's first cube and square design which he developed around New Year 1968. As a result, it became known as kubekirken (the cube church). He was later to use the same approach in designing the Grande Arche in Paris, completed in 1989. The dimensions of the inner cube of St Nikolaj Church are very close to those of the \\"holy of holies\\" in Solomon's Temple as described in Ezekiel 40:5. The use of aerated concrete was unusual at the time. It was considered to be a creative, aesthetically new solution chosen by the architect who was working on a tight budget. As with von Spreckelsen's other churches, the walls are topped by a horizontal belt, in this case made of zinc. They are broken by slightly lower projecting sections with windows at the top, bringing light down into the interior. The recessed roof rests on these projections while the cube's four tower-like corners also allow light to penetrate into the church. The simple square-shaped structure is unusual for a religious building. Although small and modest, the church has a very expressive design. The geometric, crystalline form of the interior gives a spatial effect, allowing the room to grow beyond its boundaries. Lighting from above gives the white concrete walls a receding look. The woodwork is pine while the flooring is of cement tiles and pine. The altar, which stands on a low podium, stands opposite the entrance and the organ. There is a bench behind the altar for the priest while the congregation sits on pews which fan out forming a semi-circle around the altar. The complex also consists of a rectory as well as a wing with meeting rooms. The glazed passageway joining these to the church acts as an entrance to both the church and the other facilities. The church has seating for 100.

His name is attached to the Cini-Sawatzky theory (related to the Auger effect) and the ZSA (Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen) model. Education and career George A. Sawatzky earned in 1965 his B.S. in physics with Honours from the University of Manitoba and there in 1969 his PhD with thesis Some properties of Ferrimagnetic Spinels and their determination with the Mössbauer effect under the supervision of Allan H. Morrish. From 1969 to 1971 Sawatzky was a post-doc and member of the group led by Adrianus \\"Ad\\" J. Dekker and L. H. V. (Lucas) van der Woude at the University of Groningen and there from 1971 to 1979 was an associate professor and from 1979 to 1985 a professor in the Physical Chemistry Department. From 1985 to 2001 he was Professor of Applied and Solid State Physics at the University of Gronigen. From 1986 to 1997 he was also director of the Materials Science Centre at the University of Groningen. In 2001 he was appointed a professor at the University of British Columbia. From 2002 to 2007, Sawatzky was Director of the Advanced materials and process engineering Laboratory at UBC and from 2010 to the present, he is Director of the Quantum Matter Institute and the MP/UBC Quantum Materials centre at UBC. He is one of the directors of the Max Planck Institute. He has been a visiting professor at the University of Osaka and the University of Paris. He has been the thesis advisor of over 40 doctoral students, at least 14 of whom have found employment as university professors. Research Since 1966 Sawatzky has published in scientific journals more than 380 articles. His papers have been cited more than 28,000 times according to ISI Thomson. He has published 77 papers with more than 100 citations and his so-called H index (Hirsch index is 87). According to CIFAR, his research \\"focuses on: electronic structure of nanostructured strongly correlated materials, such as magnetic materials, high temperature superconductors, and materials for electronics applications; the development and use of various synchrotron-based spectroscopic methods to study such systems; as well as theoretical methods to describe the relationship between the physical properties and the chemical composition, structure and morphology.\\" Sawatzky has made major contribution to the understanding of transition metal oxides (such as gamma and alpha Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) and more generally correlated electron systems and also to the development of spectroscopic techniques suited to study the electronic structure of these systems. He generated some of the earliest ideas about effects such as transferred and, especially, supertransfered hyperfine fields and developed the theory to describe these in terms of the covalency of the Fe–O bonds. He pioneered the cluster approach now used in understanding the Fe-O-Fe bond angle, the superexchange interaction, and the supertransferred hyperfine fields, as well as the electronic structure of strongly correlated systems like the high temperature superconductors and colossal magneto resistance materials. In the early 1970s Sawatzky and his co-workers used transport measurements and various resonant techniques like ESR and NMR to study spin echo NMR. The knowledge obtained concerning spin echo NMR led to the discovery of the so-called sand memory, which is a memory based on a powder of crystalline SiO2 in which the address of information is the frequency of an electromagnetic pulse and the content of such an address is observable in an echo at a time separation equal to that written perhaps a long time ago at the same frequency. The theory describing this effect was also developed by Sawatzky in collaboration with the solid state theorist Gerrit Vertogen. In the 1980s Sawatzky showed how photoelectron and Bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy could be used to determine the Hubbard U in magnetic impurity systems and rare earths. His group was the first to directly observe the exchange splitting of the Mn3d impurity states in the Kondo-like systems containing Mn impurities. His group also showed that the band gap in NiO was of a charge transfer type and not a Mott Hubbard type. Together with Jan Zaanen and James W. Allen, Sawatzky developed the ZSA model (which became widely used) for describing the basics of the electronic structure of 3d transition metal oxides. In the mid 1980s Sawatzky was introduced to X-ray absorption spectroscopy and the use of synchrotron radiation by John Fuggle. Sawatzky and his group started a long and very productive study of X-ray spectroscopies which form the basis for widely used spectroscopies at present. Over the past 3 decades he has led important research in theories and experiments related to strongly correlated materials.

He was a prolific writer, and published many novels on topics that were considered daring for the times, some of which were serialized in the press. Life Jean-Louis Dubut de Laforest was born in Saint-Pardoux-la- Rivière, Dordogne on 24 July 1853. He attended secondary schools in Périgueux and Limoges. After studying law, Jean-Louis Laforest Dubut became an advocate and editor of the newspaper L'Avenir de la Dordogne. He was appointed prefectorial counselor in Beauvais, Oise, in 1879, but resigned in 1882 and devoted himself to literature. He wrote many novels and plays, and contributed to Le Figaro under the pseudonym \\"Jean Tolbiac\\". Dubut de Laforest was a member of Le Chat Noir and of the theatrical and artistic circle Gardénia, founded by Paul Fabre. He published a number of novels that were based on the scientific discoveries of his time, and also novels of manners: Les Dames de Lameth, Tête à l'envers, La Crucifiée, Le Rêve d'un viveur, Un américain de Paris, Belle-maman, La Baronne Emma, Contes à la paresseuse, Les Dévorants de Paris, Le Gaga, La Bonne à tout-faire, Le Cornac, Mademoiselle de Marbeuf and Contes à la lune. In Le Faiseur d'hommes (The Maker of Men) (1884), Dubut de Laforest treated the problem of artificial insemination of a woman for the first time in the history of literature. He addressed realities such as the existence of homosexual circles in Paris in La Vierge du trottoir and Esthètes et cambrioleurs. He broke literary taboos. When he published Le Gaga in 1885 he was prosecuted for obscenity before the court of Assizes. The author was sentenced to a fine of 1,000 francs and two months in prison. Collected in the thirty-seven volume series Derniers Scandales de Paris (1898-1900), his novels of manners depicted a whole parallel world of prostitutes, pimps and bad boys. He was called \\"an anticlerical and obscene novelist\\" by a conservative critic. He shared with other authors the distinction of being placed in the \\"inferno\\" of the National Library. Despite his success, Dubut de Laforest committed suicide on 3 April 1902.

The Hitler and Mannerheim recording is a voice recording of a private conversation between Adolf Hitler, Führer of Nazi Germany, and Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defence Forces, during a secret visit honoring Mannerheim's 75th birthday on 4 June 1942 during the Continuation War, a sub-theater of World War II. Thor Damen, an engineer for the Finnish broadcasting company Yle, recorded the first 11 minutes of Hitler and Mannerheim's private conversation. Damen had been assigned to record the official birthday speeches and Mannerheim's responses. However, Damen continued recording—without Hitler's knowledge—after the conversation switched from official to private. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking in an unofficial tone.  Visit by Hitler  left In June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Despite the initial and overwhelming success of the campaign, the Soviets repulsed the German assault on Moscow and stalled the German advance. Hitler required his allies to tie down as much of the enormous Soviet military machine as possible. In 1942, Hitler, under extreme secrecy, visited Finland, officially to congratulate Mannerheim on his 75th birthday. Mannerheim did not wish to greet Hitler at his headquarters, as it would have appeared like a state visit.\\"Conversation Secretly Recorded in Finland Helped German Actor Prepare for Hitler Role\\". Helsingin Sanomat. Retrieved 2014-24-04. Therefore, the meeting occurred at Imatra in Southern Finland. At Immola Airfield, Hitler was greeted and accompanied by President Ryti and other state and military officials to Mannerheim's personal train, where a birthday meal and negotiations took place.  Microphone  Hitler and Mannerheim talking in the train After the official greetings and speeches had taken place, Hitler and Mannerheim, accompanied by other German and Finnish officials, entered Mannerheim's private wagon for cigars, drinks and lunch. In this wagon, a large and visible microphone had been set up by the Finnish sound engineer, Thor Damen. The microphone recorded the first 11 minutes of Hitler's private conversation with Mannerheim. On the tape, Hitler discusses the failure of Operation Barbarossa, Italian defeats in Africa, Yugoslavia, and Albania, his surprise of the Soviet Union's ability to produce thousands of tanks, and his strategic concerns about Romanian petroleum wells. Damen had been assigned to record Hitler's official speech and birthday message to Mannerheim. Hitler was unaware that the microphone was still recording after the official speeches, but Damen continued to record the now-private conversation. After 11 minutes, Hitler's SS guards realized what Damen was doing. They made a cutthroat gesture to demand that he cease recording. The SS guards demanded the tape be destroyed, but Yle was allowed to keep the tape in a sealed container, promising never to open it again. The tape was given to the head of the state censors' office, Kustaa Vilkuna, returned to Yle in 1957, and made publicly available a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking in an unofficial tone and one of the very few recordings in which Hitler may be heard delivering a narrative without raising his voice.  Authenticity  After the tape was revealed to the public, some believed it was a fake because Hitler's voice sounded too soft. Photographs taken on the day of the event showed that Hitler had been drinking alcohol, which could have affected his voice, as he rarely drank. After listening to the recording, Rochus Misch, Hitler's former bodyguard and radio operator, said: The BKA (German Federal Criminal Police Office) later examined the tape, and Head of Frequencies Stefan Gfroerer declared that it is \\"very obvious to us that this is Hitler's voice.\\" The carriage where the meeting took place  In popular culture  The other of Mannerheim's saloon coaches, where the meeting took place is displayed outside a Shell service station by Finnish national road 12 in Sastamala.

Slides leaked by Snowden also disclose the deployment of \\"honey traps\\" of a sexual nature by British intelligence agents.  Operations  Extract from a 2011 report on JTRIG's activities, listing the cyber-techniques used. In 2011, the JTRIG conducted a denial-of-service attack (DoS) on the activist network Anonymous. Other JTRIG targets have included the government of Iran and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Campaigns operated by JTRIG have broadly fallen into two categories; cyber attacks and propaganda efforts. The propaganda efforts (named \\"Online Covert Action\\" utilize \\"mass messaging\\" and the \\"pushing [of] stories\\" via the medium of Twitter, Flickr, Facebook and YouTube. Online \\"false flag\\" operations are also used by JTRIG against targets. JTRIG have also changed photographs on social media sites, as well as emailing and texting colleagues and neighbours with \\"unsavory information\\" about the targeted individual. A computer virus named Ambassadors Reception has been used by GCHQ \\"in a variety of different areas\\" and has been described in the slides as \\"very effective.\\" The virus can \\"encrypt itself, delete all emails, encrypt all files, [and] make [the] screen shake\\" when sent to adversaries. The virus can also block a user from logging on to their computer. Information obtained by GCHQ is also used in \\"close access technical operations,\\" in which targets are physically observed by intelligence officers, sometimes in person at hotels. Telephone calls can also be listened to and hotel computers tapped, the documents ask, \\"Can we influence hotel choice? Can we cancel their visits?\\". In a \\"honey trap\\" an identified target is lured \\"to go somewhere on the Internet, or a physical location\\" to be met by \\"a friendly face\\", with the aim to discredit them. A \\"honey trap\\" is described as \\"very successful when it works\\" by the slides. The disclosures also revealed the technique of \\"credential harvesting\\", in which journalists could be used to disseminate information and identify non- British journalists who, once manipulated, could give information to the intended target of a secret campaign, perhaps providing access during an interview. It is unknown whether the journalists would be aware that they were being manipulated. A JTRIG operation saw GCHQ \\"significantly disrupt\\" the communications of the Taliban in Afghanistan with a \\"blizzard\\" of faxes, phone calls and text messages scheduled to arrive every minute. Specific JTRIG operations also targeted the nuclear programme of Iran with negative information on blogs attacking private companies, to affect business relationships and scupper business deals. JTRIG also undertook cyber- operations as part of a wider GCHQ mission to prevent the Argentine takeover of the Falkland Islands. The scope of the cyber tactics used in this operation was unclear. The name given to JTRIG's role was Operation Quito. In June 2015, NSA files published by Glenn Greenwald revealed new details about JTRIG's work at covertly manipulating online communities and internal activities within the United Kingdom. UK agencies that JTRIG says it co-operates with include the Metropolitan police, Security Service (MI5), National Crime Agency (NCA), Border Agency, Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and National Public Order and Intelligence Unit (NPOIU).

It was a dower house on the Courtown estate and is a good example of a rural regency style house. Owning two residences was not uncommon for wealthy families during the 19th century and the Stopfords (the family name of the Earls of Courtown) were no exception. Guests regularly came to stay at both Marlfield and Courtown House, the principal family home, located about three miles from Marlfield. The Stopford family was ultimately unable to support their lavish lifestyle and Courtown House no longer exists. Marlfield House was further improved in 1866 by James Thomas Stopford (1794-1858), fourth Earl of Courtown. The house has historic connections with James Walter Milles Stopford (1853-1933), sixth Earl of Courtown, Major James Richard Neville Stopford OBE (1877-1857), seventh Earl of Courtown, and James Montagu Burgoyne Stopford (1908-1975), eighth Earl of Courtown. It is now a hotel.  Architecture  Marlfield House was built in 1852 and modified in 1866 and is an important part of the 19th-century heritage of the area around Gorey.

This Asian fresh water river carp can be discovered in southern Thailand, east to Vietnam and south to Indonesia. The species is known from the Chao Phraya and Mekong rivers. This fish has been attributed to Valenciennes however, in his original notes, he claims that the fish he described \\"formed part of the collection made in Java by Kuhl and Van Hesselt; they named it Dourr.\\" Certainly, the type locality is Java, in Indonesia and the holotype is lodged at Bogor Zoology Museum.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311707821_Disentangling_the_Taxonomy_of_the_Mahseers_Tor_spp_of_Malaysia_An_Integrated_Approach_Using_Morphology_Genetics_and_Historical_Records  Validity  In recent years it has been suggested that Tor douronensis is synonymous with Tor tambra, following the work of Tyson R. Roberts in 1999. Since then, in 2017, Ng Chee Kiat et al. have published a paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316071083_Review_A_working_checklist_of_the_freshwater_fish_diversity_for_habitat_management_and_conservation_work_in_Sabah_Malaysia_North_Borneo on the fish diversity of Sabah state in Malaysian Borneo.

Taxonomic and genetic issues  Along with many mahseer species in other parts of the region, there is much confusion around the taxonomic and genetic differences between species. Tor douronensis as described from Java has a body length 4.5 times the maximum body height, a short head measuring 1/5 of the body length and 21 lateral line scales. In most places where the locals understand their fish to be Tor douronensis, the fish displays a shorter head and deeper body than Tor tambra. These fish also appear to have unusually long barbels compared to other mahseer in the area. There are studies that have looked at the genetics of the Indonesian mahseers (Tor tambra, Tor tambroides and Tor douronensis) https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrine_Rovie- Ryan/publication/231057782_Mitochondrial_DNA_Diversity_of_Tor_douronensis_Valenciennes_Cyprinidae_in_Malaysian_Borneo/links/09e415061bf0794042000000/Mitochondrial- DNA-Diversity-of-Tor-douronensis-Valenciennes-Cyprinidae-in-Malaysian- Borneo.pdfhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/231061593_Molecular_Systematics_of_Mahseers_Cyprinidae_in_Malaysia_Inferred_from_Sequencing_of_a_Mitochondrial_Cytochrome_C_Oxidase_I_COI_Gene but with the exception of Walton's study of Tor tambra none of the known studies have made comparisons with specimens collected from the type locality. Therefore, the specimens studied cannot be validated as the species named. The only way that the validity of Tor douronensis can be moved forward is by a concerted study in the river basin of the type locality.  Localities  In Indonesia this fish is locally known as kancra bodas or ikan dewa (god's fish). It is rarely found in rivers and ponds in Indonesia, especially in Java, Sumatera and Borneo. Because of its rarity, the Sundanese people consider it as a sacred fish. It can be found in rivers and ponds around Mount Cereme, West Java, such as Cibulan, Cigugur, Pasawahan, Linggajati, dan Darmaloka sacred ponds. Because of its rarity in Indonesia, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences considering to propose to CITES to give it the status as protected endangered species. In Thailand, this fish is known as pla pluang chomphu or pla vien chomphu (; lit: pink mahseer, pink brook carp) by the colour of the scales and fins are light red or pink. In 1981, this species was in an endangered status. Due to the habitat was destroyed from the Bang Lang Dam, the new dam was built. Subsequently, specimens were collected from nature for breeding. Which was successful, but it also yields less. In the year of 1999, Queen Sirikit proceeded to the Bang Lang Dam and released the fish back to nature. Later, she had the initiative to find fish to farm on the Royal Project. It can be grown in large quantities nowadays by Yala Inland Fisheries Station under Department of Fisheries. Presently, this fish has a very expensive price. They sell at 2,000 baht (about US$60) per kg. and in Hong Kong at 8,000 baht per kg. (US$242).

His daughter is Mary Brown Bullock, who was President of Agnes Scott College and a foundation executive in developing exchange with China.  Education  G. Thompson Brown (1921-2014) was born in Kuling (now Lushan) Jiangxi province, China. His parents, Frank A. Brown and Charlotte Thompson Brown, were both Presbyterian missionaries, so he attended school and grew up in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China until he graduated high school. He then moved back to the United States and attended Davidson College, where he graduated with a BA in 1942. After a brief time in the army, he then attended Union Theological Seminary, where he earned a BD in 1949 and a ThD in 1963. In 1950 he also earned a ThM from Princeton Seminary. Later in 2012 he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Honam Theological Seminary, the school he helped create.  Life  After Brown graduated from Davidson College, he served in World War II as a U.S. Army Signal Corps officer until the end of the war. Then after his graduation from Princeton Seminary, he served as the pastor at Adams Memorial and Linwood Presbyterian Churches in Gastonia, NC for two years. He was then appointed as a missionary for the Presbyterian Church to Korea in 1952. During his time there he worked with churches in southwest Korea. He later founded the Honam Theological Academy in Gwangju (now the Honam Theological University and Seminary), one of seven seminaries in Korea. After its establishment he worked there as Professor of New Testament in 1955 and later as president from 1960 to 1967, while still serving his role as PCUS missionary. From 1967 until 1973, Brown was Area Secretary for East Asia, and later Field Secretary for Korea while lecturing in New Testament at the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Seoul, Korea. In 1973, he returned to Atlanta as Director of International Missions for the Southern Presbyterian Church.

The Center includes four rotating exhibition galleries and a sculpture garden. It is member-funded and offers adult and youth classes, workshops, and programs. The Center was established in 1926 as the Sarasota Art Association. History The Sarasota Art Association (SAA) was established in 1926 as the first arts organization in Sarasota. Founder Marcia Rader, Art Supervisor of the Sarasota School System, was the driving force behind the initial meetings of local art supporters who formed the association. The first official meeting of the SAA took place on a Friday evening in February of 1932. Also in 1932, the Sarasota Art Association along with the Daytona Beach Art league, became a member of the Florida Federation of Art, a state-wide arts organization that promoted the arts across Florida, through the fellowship of independent artists, museums, and other cultural institutions. In 1941, the Association incorporated as a not-for-profit organization. At that time, the stated mission was “to promote the educational and cultural advantages of Sarasota in the field of contemporary art.\\" Many renowned local artists like Jerry Farnsworth, Elden Rowland, Syd Solomon and Hilton Leech were instrumental in establishing the center as the focal point for Sarasota's visual arts. The City of Sarasota provided the Art Association with a lease of land near the downtown area, and in 1948 the association broke ground for its present building which was designed by T.R. Martin and his son Frank Martin in the then-popular style of the Sarasota School of Architecture. The building opened in 1949 with only one gallery which is now known as Gallery 3. The association's philosophy during the 1960s, stated that “while the gallery is important to display the works of local artists, one-man shows and traveling exhibitions, there is a social aspect of the association that bears heavy fruit. It is a meeting place for all who are interested in the many phases of art; it is a place to make friends and see what is going on in Sarasota…” This philosophy is still the inherent mission of Art Center Sarasota today. In 2000 the Sarasota Art Association merged with artist and instructor Hilton Leech’s “Friends of the Arts and Sciences” and became Art Center Sarasota. An art education program was put into place along with exhibitions.

The project would cost US$5 billion to $10 billion and take six to 10 years to complete. Katz said that the project would free Israel of responsibility for controlling commerce with Gaza and \\"aims at a total break with the Gaza Strip, while now Israel continues to be responsible for the trade of this area because we have not permitted the building of a port and airport\\" ... \\"would allow us to break all ties with Gaza while maintaining our control over maritime security through the blockade, which is critical in blocking arms traffic\\" [and the plan would allow Israel] \\"to take the initiative, gain international support and open a political horizon on the key question of Gaza, without having to rely on Hamas.\\" Environmentalists and Palestinian officials described the venture as \\"fantasy\\" and \\"madness\\", and accused the minister of political opportunism. A PA spokesman said that there were lots of simpler measures to improve the lives of Palestinians. \\"If they want to help Palestinians, they must end the siege on Gaza, and allow the reintegration of the West Bank and Gaza and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Then they are welcome to make proposals.\\"  2014 PA plan  In February 2014, Palestinian Transportation Minister Nabil Dmeidi revealed that the Palestinian Authority and Egypt have been working on plans for building two airports in the West Bank, as well as a seaport in the Gaza Strip and a railway line between the Gaza Strip and Cairo.

H.R. 3590 would establish or amend certain laws related to the use of firearms and other recreational activities on federal lands. The bill also would authorize the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to permanently allow any state to provide hunting and conservation stamps for migratory birds (referred to as federal duck stamps). In addition, the bill would require the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to charge an annual permit fee for small crews that conduct commercial filming activities on certain federal lands. Finally, the bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits to certain hunters seeking to import polar bear remains from Canada. It passed the United States House of Representatives on February 5, 2014 during the 113th United States Congress. Another bill known as the SHARE Act was introduced during the 115th Congress in the House as H.R. 3668. Background According to Fishing Tackle Retailer, an industry magazine, there are over 50 million fishers and hunters in the United States. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Sportsmen's Heritage And Recreational Enhancement Act of 2013 or the SHARE Act of 2013 is divided into multiple titles. Title I: Hunting, Fishing and Recreational Shooting Protection Act - The Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting Protection Act would amend the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to exclude from the definition of \\"chemical substance\\" for purposes of such Act: (1) any component of any pistol, revolver, firearm, shell, or cartridge the sale of which is subject to federal excise tax, including shot, bullets and other projectiles, propellants, and primers; and (2) any sport fishing equipment the sale of which is subject to federal excise tax and sport fishing equipment components. Title II: Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act - The Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act would amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to: (1) authorize a state to pay up to 90% of the costs of acquiring land for, expanding, or constructing a public target range; (2) authorize a state to elect to allocate 10% of a specified amount apportioned to it from the federal aid to wildlife restoration fund for such costs; (3) limit the federal share of such costs under such Act to 90%; and (4) require amounts provided for such costs under such Act to remain available for expenditure and obligation for five fiscal years. This title would also shield the United States from any civil action or claim for money damages for injury to or loss of property, personal injury, or death caused by an activity occurring at a public target range that is funded by the federal government pursuant to such Act or located on federal land, except to the extent provided under the Federal Tort Claims Act with respect to the exercise or performance of a discretionary function. This title would also urge the Chief of the United States Forest Service and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management to cooperate with state and local authorities and other entities to carry out waste removal and other activities on any federal land used as a public target range to encourage its continued use for target practice or marksmanship training. Title III: Public Lands Filming - This title would require the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), for any film crew of five persons or fewer, to require a permit and assess an annual fee of $200 for commercial filming activities or similar projects on federal land and waterways administered by the Secretary. It would make such a permit valid for such activities or projects that occur in areas designated for public use during public hours on all federal land and waterways administered by the Secretary for a 12-month period. Title IV: Polar Bear Conservation and Fairness Act - The Polar Bear Conservation and Fairness Act of 2013 would amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to direct the Secretary of the Interior to issue a permit for the importation of any polar bear part (other than an internal organ) from a polar bear taken in a sport hunt in Canada to any person: (1) who submits proof that the polar bear was legally harvested before February 18, 1997 (current law); or (2) who has submitted, with an application submitted before May 15, 2008, proof that the bear was legally harvested before such date from a polar bear population from which a sport-hunted trophy could be imported before such date. (Polar bears were listed as a threatened species by the Department of the Interior on May 14, 2008.) Title V: Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act - The Permanent Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2013 would amend the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978 to exempt an authorized taking of migratory birds and collection of their eggs by indigenous inhabitants of Alaska from the prohibition on taking under the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act. Title V would also grant the Secretary of the Interior permanent authority to authorize any state to issue electronic duck stamps. It would also set forth state electronic duck stamp application requirements. Title V would allow the Secretary to determine the number of new states permitted per year to participate in the electronic duck stamp program. It also instructs the Secretary to require electronic stamp revenue and customer information collected by each state to be transmitted in accordance with a written agreement between the Secretary and the state. Title VI: Access to Water Resources Development Projects Act The Recreational Lands Self-Defense Act of 2013 would prohibit the Secretary of the Army from promulgating or enforcing any regulation that prohibits an individual from possessing a firearm at a water resources development project administered by the Chief of Engineers if: (1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and (2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the law of the state in which the project is located. Title VII: Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council Advisory Committee This title would amend the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act to establish the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council Advisory Committee to advise the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture (USDA) on wildlife and habitat conservation, hunting, and recreational shooting. Title VII would abolish the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council. Title VIII: Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act would declare that recreational fishing and hunting are environmentally acceptable and beneficial activities that occur and can be provided on public lands and waters without adverse effects on other uses or users. This title would require a federal public land management official, in cooperation with the respective state and fish and wildlife agency, to exercise the authority of the official under law, including regarding land use planning, to facilitate the use of, and access to, federal public land for fishing, sport hunting, and recreational shooting, except as described in this Act. It would require the heads of federal public land management agencies to exercise their discretion in a manner that supports and facilitates hunting, recreational fishing, and recreational shooting opportunities, to the extent authorized under applicable law. The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act would prohibit actions taken under this Act or actions concerning the National Wildlife Refuge System under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 from being considered to be a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act would prohibit public land management officials from being required to consider the existence or availability of recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting opportunities on adjacent or nearby lands in the planning for or determination of which public lands are open for these activities or in the setting of levels of use for these activities on public lands, unless the combination or coordination of such opportunities would enhance the opportunities available to the public. It would require that Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service land, excluding land on the Outer Continental Shelf, be open to recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting unless the managing agency acts to close lands to such activity. It would permit closures or restrictions on such land for purposes including resource conservation, public safety, energy or mineral production, energy generation or transmission infrastructure, water supply facilities, national security, protection of private property rights, or compliance with other law. The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act would require agencies to: (1) lease or permit use of federal public land for shooting ranges, and (2) designate specific land for recreational shooting activities. It would declare that the provision of opportunities for hunting, fishing, recreational shooting, and the conservation of fish and wildlife to provide sustainable use recreational opportunities on designated wilderness areas on federal public lands constitutes the measures necessary to meet the minimum requirements for the administration of such areas. It would provide that such declaration does not authorize or facilitate commodity development, use, or extraction, motorized recreational access or use that is not otherwise allowed under the Wilderness Act, or permanent road construction or maintenance within designated wilderness areas. The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act would reaffirm the provisions of the Wilderness Act that stipulate that wilderness purposes are \\"within and supplemental to\\" the purposes of the underlying federal land unit. It would require the head of each federal agency, when seeking to carry out fish and wildlife conservation programs and projects or providing fish and wildlife dependent recreation opportunities on designated wilderness areas, to implement these supplemental purposes while not impeding on the underlying conservation purpose. It would prohibit such implementation from authorizing or facilitating commodity development, use or extraction, or permanent road construction or use within designated wilderness areas. The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act would require biennial reports on closures of federal public lands to sport hunting, recreational fishing, or shooting. It would set forth requirements for specified closures or significant restrictions involving 640 or more contiguous acres of federal public land or water to hunting or recreational fishing or related activities. The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act would instruct federal public land agencies to consult with the advisory councils specified in Executive Orders 12962 (relating to recreational fisheries) and 13443 (relating to the facilitation of hunting heritage and wildlife conservation) in carrying out this Act. Congressional Budget Office report A title by title summary and report on H.R. 3590 by the Congressional Budget Office. This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced on November 21, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3590 would establish or amend certain laws related to the use of firearms and other recreational activities on federal lands. The bill also would authorize the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to permanently allow any state to provide hunting and conservation stamps for migratory birds (referred to as federal duck stamps). In addition, the bill would require the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to charge an annual permit fee for small crews that conduct commercial filming activities on certain federal lands. Finally, the bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits to certain hunters seeking to import polar bear remains from Canada. Based on information provided by the affected agencies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 3590 would have no significant net impact on the federal budget. Enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. However, CBO estimates that the net budgetary effects would not be significant in any year. H.R. 3590 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). H.R. 3590 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in UMRA by eliminating an individual’s existing right to seek compensation from the federal government for damages occurring at a public target range supported by federal funds. The cost of the mandate would be the forgone value of awards and settlements in such claims. Information from the Department of the Interior indicates that few, if any, of those types of lawsuits are brought against the U.S. government. Because such claims would probably continue to be uncommon in the future, CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would be small and fall well below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). Procedural history The Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 21, 2013 by Rep. Robert E. Latta (R, OH-5). It was referred to several committees and subcommittees, including: United States House Committee on Natural Resources, United States House Committee on Agriculture, United States House Committee on the Judiciary, United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy, United States House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Energy, and Forestry, United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice, United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. Eleven proposed amendments were ruled in order for the House to debate and vote on. On February 5, 2014, the House voted in Roll Call Vote #41 to pass the bill 268-154. Debate and discussion President Barack Obama announced his opposition to the bill, but did not threaten to veto it. The Obama Administration said that it was fine with several parts of the bill, including the polar bear trophy importation rules, issuing duck stamps electronically, and not counting some fishing equipment as a toxic substance. The administration said that it supports Titles II, IV, V, and does not object to Title I. However, the administration said that it was against Titles VIII and VI, with concerns about VII and III. The Bull Moose Sportsmen’s Alliance spoke out in favor of the bill. Their Director Gaspar Perricone described the bill as \\"a great first step towards getting a sportsmen's package passed by Congress\\" and said that it \\"addresses a lot of critical concerns for sportsmen.\\" He did say, however, that the \\"bill has a few question marks that we'd like to see clarified and we'd love to have some funding for critical conservation projects.\\" The U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance was also in favor of the bill, and urged members to call their representatives in Congress and ask them to vote in favor of the bill. Some Democrats opposed the bill because it was a \\"waste of time\\". According to Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), \\"seventy-five percent of all federal lands are open to recreational hunting, fishing and shooting.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Shooting ranges in the United States Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 3590 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 3590 *GovTrack.us H.R. 3590 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 3590 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 3590 *House Republicans' Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 3590 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Sportsmen's Heritage And Recreational Enhancement Act of 2013"},{"id":"41852413","text":"Jon Vega Villasante (born 8 June 1994) is a Spanish footballer who plays for SD Leioa as a centre back.

Motivational Speaker Jamie has delivered motivational, entertaining and inspiring talks for schools, businesses, charities, and after dinner events all around the world. Whilst sharing his adventures and hardships, he focuses on finding more motivation, never giving up, and helping people to discover more within themselves to make a difference in the world. He has received acclaim from notable people including Sir Steve Redgrave, Sir Geoff Hurst, Dame Kelly Holmes, Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Prince Harry. Author In 2017, Jamie released a book called, Adventureman: Anyone Can Be a Superhero, about his historic 5,000-mile run across Canada, that quickly became a best-seller on Amazon. Adventureman suit Whilst McDonald does his adventures, he always dresses up in his alter-ego custom made costume, Adventureman - which was designed by 10-year-old Conner Reddy who suffers with dyspraxia. Cycling Bangkok to Gloucester In 2012, McDonald bought a second hand bike and decided to cycle the 14,000 miles from Bangkok to his hometown Gloucester, passing through dozens of countries. Along the way he was shot at, arrested and slept rough. He documented his journey in a series of YouTube clips. Static Cycle World Record Two days after he finished the journey back from Bangkok; McDonald made the decision to attempt the world static cycling record, which stood at 224 hours and 24 minutes. It was a challenge he had conceived whilst cycling from Bangkok. He stepped off the exercise bike set up within a marquee in Gloucester after pedalling for a Guinness world record breaking 268 hours – more than eleven days. Solo run across Canada McDonald set off on 9 March 2013 from St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, on the Atlantic coast and completed the journey of 5,000 miles to Vancouver on the Pacific on 3 February 2014. Jamie spoke to schools and businesses throughout the entire journey to help with fundraising. His original intention had been to complete the journey before the winter. McDonald was inspired by Terry Fox, one-legged and suffering from cancer, whose run across Canada was cut short by cancer. On the route, McDonald faced a number of ordeals: he endured −40C temperatures, he was beaten and robbed celebrating the new year in Banff, Alberta, and had to push his load in a pushchair when he was no longer able to carry it on his back. Suffering from acute tendinitis in his foot, he continued his run and a bone spur has grown over the inflammation. He slept rough on the side of the road unless taken in by strangers. He wore through 10 pairs of trainers. He raised more than $500,000 (£250,000) for children's charities in the UK and Canada in a bid to give back to the charities that supported him as an unwell child. Solo run across America McDonald started his run on 10 April 2018 on the West Coast at Cape Alava, in Washington's Clallam County, and completed his 5,500-mile (or 210 marathon) run a year later on the East Coast in Gloucester, Massachusetts before his year long visa ran out. During the adventure, he fought through desolate +50C deserts, was caught in a terrifying flood in Junction, Texas, been mistaken for a Mexican drug runner, dodged striking snakes, scorpions, spiders, even a mountain lion and was ordered to come out of his tent \\"with his hands first\\" by a police officer with his hand on his holster. Throughout McDonald raised money for U.S children's hospitals and sick children in the U.K and raised nearly $200,000 (£175,000). Treadmill World Record If that wasn't enough just weeks later, McDonald then broke one of the toughest endurance world records on the planet, spending 7 days on a treadmill, surviving off less than 3 hours of sleep a night; running the most amount of miles humanly possible to this point in time; a record breaking distance of 524 miles. Jamie spent more than 20 hours a day running, covering more than 3 marathons a day - a total of 20 marathons back-to-back. During the challenge, he broke through both physical and emotional barriers, finally reaching 'the beyond', having bouts of naturally formed hallucinations and chemicals being produced around his body, surprisingly giving him power to continue on. Superhero Foundation Jamie co-founded Superhero Foundation, a charity aiming to \\"empower real-life Superheroes to change, and save lives\\". In the UK, the charity supports individuals raising money for treatment not provided by the NHS, as well as supporting kids hospitals. The charity began by helping Gloucestershire-based father James Bottger raise money to help his wheel-chair bound daughter for an operation in the US to enable her to walk for the rest of her life. Bottger climbed up and down Robinswood Hill in Gloucester, UK, 75 times, until he 'reached the equivalent of Mount Everest', raising tens of thousands of pounds in the process. Since, the charity has helped other families in similar situations. Personal life McDonald was born in Gloucester, England to Donald and Ann McDonald. As a child, McDonald battled an immune deficiency, epilepsy, and syringomyelia and was frequently hospitalised up to the age of nine. Honours and awards In December 2012, McDonald achieved a World Record for 'Marathon Static Cycling' - stepping off the bike at 268 hours (more than 12 days). In 2013, during his run across Canada, in Calgary, Jamie was Awarded the White Hat (in previous years the likes of Prince William, Kate Middleton, Arnold Schwarzenegger and many more have also been White Hatted). Voted 'Male Runner Of The Year' and awarded the 'Golden Shoe' from Canadian Running magazine. After the run across Canada, on his homecoming in Gloucester, Jamie was presented with the Medal of the City of Gloucester - the highest accolade the Mayor of Gloucester can bestow. In September 2014 McDonald was named Pride of Britain's 'Fundraiser of the Year' for the West. He was named in the Independent's 'Happy List 2014', a list of 100 people giving back to the community. Ambassador of the Year at the Believe in Gloucester Awards 2014. National Adventure Award Winner for 'Fundraiser of the Year' in 2014. Honorary Fellowship from the University of Gloucestershire in 2015. Pride of Britain winner for 'Fundraiser of the Year' - 2019.

During Tang Dynasty  It is not known when Li Sijian—likely known as Tuoba Sijian at his birth—was born. His family was of Dangxiang stock, of the Pingxia () branch. His older brother Tuoba Sigong became a warlord during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang and, for his role in aiding the Tang Dynasty imperial government against the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao's state of Qi, was given the title of military governor of Dingnan Circuit, and was also given the imperial clan surname of Li. Li Sijian would have taken the surname of Li at the same time as well.New Book of Tang, vol. 221, part 1. Li Sigong died around 886 (as he died before he could launch an army against the pretender Li Yun in support of Emperor Xizong—and Li Yun's regime was defeated in 886).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Li Sijian succeeded him as military governor of Dingnan, while another brother, Li Sixiao (), was given Baoda Circuit (保大, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi). (A different and inconsistent account, contained in the New History of the Five Dynasties, indicated that Li Sijian did not become military governor of Dingnan until 895, but that account appeared to confuse Li Sigong with another brother of theirs, Li Sijing ()New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 40. In 895, when Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong fled the capital Chang'an into the Qinling Mountains to the south of Chang'an in fear of the warlords Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), the major warlord Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) arrived in the region to aid the emperor. In response, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned him to command the operations against Wang (whom Emperor Zhaozong deemed to be more of a threat than Li Maozhen or another ally of theirs, Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (鎮國, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi)), and also commissioned Li Sijian and Li Sixiao, as well as Zhang Fan (), to aid Li Keyong in the operations. (Li Keyong subsequently defeated Wang, and Wang was killed by his own subordinates.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. In 896, with Li Maozhen again threatening Chang'an, Emperor Zhaozong fled Chang'an again, to Han's Kuangguo Circuit. While there, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned the chancellor as the overall commander of the campaign against Li Maozhen, and commissioned Li Sijian as the deputy commander, as well as the military governor of Jingnan. However, the campaign was not actually launched, as Li Maozhen claimed that he was apologizing, and Han, who was a long-term ally of Li Maozhen, also dissuaded the actual launching of the campaign. When the campaign was formally cancelled in 897, Li Sijian was made the military governor of Ningsai Circuit (寧塞, i.e., Baoda). (However, there was no real indication in historical records that Li Sijian actually reported to Ningsai.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261.  During Later Liang  In 907, the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) had Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. He bestowed on Li Sijian the honorary titles of acting Taiwei () and Shizhong ().Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 132. In 908, Li Sijian died, and his son (or grandson, or grandnephew) Li Yichang declared himself acting military governor of Dingnan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267.History of Song, vol. 485. The Later Liang emperor later formally granted full military governor title to Li Yichang.

It was introduced to the House of Commons on 5 February 2014 by Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling and received Royal Assent on 12 February 2015.  Provisions  The act's provisions include the following: * Imposing the payment of a charge of up to £600 on those convicted of a criminal offence at the point of conviction. * Making jury misconduct a specific criminal offence with a penalty of up to two years in prison. Four new misconduct laws were included to prevent jurors conducting any research into details of a case, sharing details of the research with other jurors, disclosing details of juror deliberation, and \\"engaging in other prohibited conduct\\" such as using evidence not put before the court to decide a case. These are already offences under the Contempt of Court Act 1981. * Raising the maximum age of jurors to 75 (from 70). * Amending the extreme pornography law to ban the possession of pornographic images depicting acts of rape. * Introducing a new offence of being \\"unlawfully at large\\" with a punishment of up to two years in prison for criminals who go on the run while serving the non-custodial element of their sentence. * Abolishing automatic early release for those convicted of serious terrorism charges or child rape. * Ending police cautions for child pornography offences or supplying class A drugs as well as in those cases where an offender has been cautioned or convicted for a similar offence in the previous two years. * Allowing single magistrates (rather than a bench of two or three) to preside over \\"low-level regulatory cases\\". This provision also allows certain offences to be dealt with by a single magistrate outside the courtroom. * Creating \\"secure colleges\\", a new form of secure educational establishment for young offenders. The first \\"pathfinder secure college\\" is expected to open in the East Midlands in 2017. * Restricting the judicial review process to specialist courts working to fixed timetables where only individuals or groups with a financial interest in a case can bring a challenge rather than general issue-based campaigning groups. * Making a whole life order the starting point for murder in the case of the murder of a police or prison officer in the course of their duties.  Amendments  * The March 2014 amendment modified the Malicious Communications Act 1988 and Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003. The maximum length of custodial sentencing for online harassment was increased from six months to two years, and magistrates gained the power to pass cases on to the Crown Court. * The October 2014 amendment created a specific offence of distributing a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress (commonly called \\"revenge porn\\"). The maximum custodial sentence is two years.  In committee  In April 2014 the assistant director of the British Board of Film Classification told a Parliamentary Bill Committee that the Clause 16 proposal to criminalise rape pornography would not result in the blocking of scenes of sexual imagery that bear no relation to reality. In June 2014 the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights claimed that the bill's proposals to allow staff in \\"secure colleges\\" to use \\"reasonable force where necessary to ensure good order and discipline\\" would contravene the European Convention on Human Rights.

The crisis began in 2014 when three major credit agencies downgraded several bond issues by Puerto Rico to \\"junk status\\" after the government was unable to demonstrate that it would be able to pay its debt. The downgrading, in turn, prevented the government from selling more bonds in the open market. Unable to obtain the funding to cover its budget imbalance, the government began using its savings to pay its debt while warning that those savings would eventually be exhausted. To prevent such a scenario, the United States Congress enacted a law known as PROMESA, which appointed an oversight board with ultimate control over the Commonwealth's budget. As the PROMESA board began to exert that control, the government sought to increase revenues and reduce its expenses by increasing taxes while curtailing public services and reducing government pensions. Those measures further compounded the crisis by provoking social distrust and unrest. In August 2018, a debt investigation report of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico reported the Commonwealth had $74 billion in bond debt and $49 billion in unfunded pension liabilities as of May 2017. Background Puerto Rico's outstanding debt Puerto Rico's budget expenses in relation to its debt obligations. Almost 9.6%—or about $1.5 billion—of Puerto Rico's central government budget expenses for FY2014 was expected to be spent on debt service.Beginning with Christopher Columbus's arrival on the island in 1493, Spain colonized Puerto Rico. At the end of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States. The United States then refused to pay the colony's creditors, asserting they held odious debt. Before 1898, the people of Puerto Rico had Spanish citizenship; after Puerto Rico stopped being part of Spain, the people of Puerto Rico had neither independent nor colonial citizenship. In April 1900, President William McKinley signed the Foraker Act, which allowed the popular election of only the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico. The Insular Cases, a series of Supreme Court decisions issued in the early 1900s, defined Puerto Rico as an unincorporated \\"territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States within the revenue clauses of the Constitution.\\" Although legally defined as a commonwealth or protectorate, Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States, in which ultimate economic and political decision making rests with the U.S. Federal Government and citizens who reside in Puerto Rico do not enjoy full constitutional rights, was deemed by Juan R. Torruella to be a colonial one. The political status of Puerto Rico makes it subject to U.S. laws. The Jones-Shafroth Act is one of these laws, which exempts interest payments from bonds issued by the government of Puerto Rico and its subdivisions from federal, state, and local income taxes (so-called \\"triple tax exemption\\") regardless of where the bondholder resided. This right made Puerto Rican bonds attractive to municipal bond investors. This factor led Puerto Rico to issue bonds that were always attractive to municipal investors, regardless of Puerto Rico's account balances. Puerto Rico thus began to issue debt to fund its expenses, a practice repeated for four decades since 1973. The island also began to issue debt to repay older debt, as well as refinancing older debt possessing low- interest rates with debt possessing higher interest rates. In 1984, Congress explicitly forbade Puerto Rico from declaring bankruptcy under Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code. Between 1996 and 2006, Congress eliminated the tax credits, contributing to the loss of 80,000 jobs on the island and causing its population to shrink and its economy to contract in all but one year since the Great Recession. Because the Constitution of Puerto Rico established that \\"all available resources\\" must first go towards payment of the Commonwealth's general obligation bonds, in 2006, the Commonwealth began issuing Puerto Rico Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, to avoid its constitution's limits by being paid directly into a separate urgent interest fund. Sales tax was increased to 11%. The last property tax assessment was done in 1958. It was not until Puerto Rico enlarged its outstanding debt to $71 billion—an amount approximately equal to 68% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product (GDP)—that Puerto Rican bonds were downgraded to non-investment grade (better known as \\"junk status\\" or speculative-grade) by three bond credit rating agencies between February 4 and 11, 2014. This downgrade triggered bond acceleration clauses that required Puerto Rico to repay certain debt instruments within months rather than years. Investors were concerned that Puerto Rico would eventually default on its debt. Such a default would reduce Puerto Rico's ability to issue bonds in the future. Puerto Rico currently states that it is unable to maintain its current operations unless it takes drastic measures that may lead to civil unrest. There have already been protests over the austerity measures. These events, along with a series of governmental financial deficits and a recession, have led to Puerto Rico's current debt crisis. Causes In 1917, the United States Congress authorized the government of Puerto Rico to issue triple tax- exempt municipal bonds. These bonds were highly attractive to U.S. investors and very low cost for Puerto Rican local government to issue, laying the groundwork for the ballooning national debt, and a public infrastructure built on that debt. A constitutional amendment in 1952 relaxed balanced budget requirements for Puerto Rico in comparison to the states and another in 1961 loosened the reins on debt capacity, encouraging Puerto Rico to continue to fund fiscal shortfalls through the issuance of triple-exempt municipal bonds. Cessation of federal subsidies For much of the 20th century, Puerto Rico was subject to favorable tax laws from the US federal government, which essentially acted to subsidize the island's economy. In 1996, US President Bill Clinton signed legislation phasing out important parts of the favorable federal tax code over ten years ending in 2006. The end of the subsidies led to companies fleeing the island which itself subsequently led to tax shortfalls. At first, the Puerto Rican government tried to make up for the shortfall by issuing bonds. The government was able to issue an unusually large number of bonds, due to dubious underwriting from financial institutions such as Santander Bank, UBS, Barclays, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup. Eventually, the debt burden became so great that the island was unable to pay interest on the bonds it had issued. Mismanagement and disparity Some newspapers, such as El Vocero, have stated that the main problem is local government inefficiency rather than lack of funds. For example, the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico is incapable of collecting 44% of the Puerto Rico Sales and Use Tax (or about $900 million), did not match what taxpayers reported to the department with the income reported by the taxpayer's employer through Form W-2s, and did not collect payments owed to the department by taxpayers that submitted tax returns without their corresponding payments. The Department of Treasury also tends to publish its comprehensive annual financial reports late, sometimes 15 months after a fiscal year ends, and the government as a whole constantly fails to comply with its continuing disclosure obligations on a timely basis. The government's accounting, payroll, and fiscal oversight information systems and processes also have deficiencies that significantly affect its ability to forecast expenditures. Similarly, salaries for government employees tend to be quite disparate when compared to the private sector and other positions within the government itself. For example, a public teacher's base salary starts at $24,000, but that of a legislative advisor starts at $74,000. The government has also been unable to set up a system based on meritocracy, with many employees, particularly executives and administrators, simply lacking the competencies required to perform their jobs. There are 78 municipalities of Puerto Rico, which budget $2.2 billion a year, with mayors' salaries alone costing $4.8 million. 36 of these have a budget deficit, putting 46% of the municipalities in financial stress. Each municipality's elected legislature, usually including 1,000 to 1,500 members, receive per diems and expense money. Just like the central government, municipalities would issue debt through the Puerto Rico Municipal Financing Agency to stabilize their finances, rather than make adjustments. In total, the combined debt carried by the municipalities of Puerto Rico accounts for $3.8 billion, or about 5.5% of Puerto Rico's outstanding debt. During the New Deal, an appointed Governor, Rexford Tugwell, created the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority by nationalizing the island's private utilities. The state monopoly provides free electricity to local governments, which prompted the mayor of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, to build an ice-skating rink. PREPA, uses oil-fired power plants, has had opaque purchasing practices, has resisted wind and solar power projects, and has a debt of $9 billion. PREPA has had poor bill collection practices, with FTI Consulting estimating that the utility had improperly given away $420 million of electricity and that the island's governments were $300 million delinquent in payments. In 2012, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority was forced to sell the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport to private buyers after PREPA threatened to cut off power over unpaid bills. In 2014, the Puerto Rico Energy Commission was established. Economic depression Between 2007 and 2017 Puerto Rico's gross national income declined by 14 percent, and in 2015, 46 percent of the population lived below the federal poverty line, compared to the U.S. national average of 15 percent. Puerto Rican national debt is now approximately $74 billion, but unlike mainland municipalities, Puerto Rico is not protected by Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and cannot file for bankruptcy. Tax policy A federal statute that contributed to the crisis was the expiration of Srction 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which had applied to Puerto Rico. The section was critical for the economy of the island, as it established tax exemptions for US corporations that settled in Puerto Rico and allowed its subsidiaries operating in the island to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time without paying federal tax on corporate income. The economy of the island was significantly reliant on the additional investment and spending generated by companies taking advantage of that provision and has been unable to replace the benefit after its loss. The disparity in federal social funding More than 60% of Puerto Rico's population receives Medicare or Medicaid services, with about 40% enrolled in Mi Salud, the Puerto Rican Medicaid program. There is a significant disparity in federal funding for these programs compared to the 50 states, a situation that Congress started in 1968, when it placed a cap on Medicaid funding for US territories. That has led to a situation in which Puerto Rico might typically receive $373 million in federal funding a year, but Mississippi, a state with a population similar to that of Puerto Rico, receives $3.6 billion. The situation leads to an exodus of underpaid health care workers to the mainland, and the disparity has also had a major impact on Puerto Rico's finances. Triple tax exemption Interest income paid to owners of bonds issued by the government of Puerto Rico and its subdivisions is exempt from federal, state, and local taxes, the so-called \\"triple tax exemption.\\" Unlike most other US triple tax-exempt bonds, such bonds retain their tax exemption regardless of where the bondholder resides in the United States, a marketing and sales advantage consequent to the restriction typically imposed on municipal bonds with triple tax exemption in which exemptions are available to bondholders that reside within the state or municipal subdivision that issues the bonds. Triple tax- exempt bonds are considered to be subsidized because bond issuers can offer a lower interest rate to satisfy bondholders and so Puerto Rico is able to issue more debt. Downgrade Puerto Rico was effectively downgraded to non- investment grade on February 4, 2014, by Standard & Poor's when it downgraded Puerto Rico's general obligation debt (GO) from BBB- status to BB+, one level below investment grade. The agency cited liquidity concerns for its downgrade and maintained a negative outlook on its watch. Moody's would follow three days later by downgrading Puerto Rico's GO debt on February 7, 2014 from Baa3 to Ba2, two levels below investment grade. Moody's, however, cited lack of economic growth for its downgrade while assigning a negative outlook to the government's ratings. Fitch Ratings would be the last to downgrade on February 11, 2014, by downgrading Puerto Rico's GO debt from BBB- to BB, two levels below investment grade. Fitch cited both liquidity concerns and lack of economic growth for its downgrade while assigning a negative outlook to the government's ratings. Each of these downgrades triggered several acceleration clauses which forced Puerto Rico to repay certain debt instruments within months rather than years. 2015 forbearance On June 28, 2015, Governor García Padilla admitted publicly that \\"the debt is not payable\\" and that if the government was unable to grow the economy, \\"we will be in a death spiral.. Before Padilla's admission, various government instruments had already entered into forbearance agreements with their lenders, but the warning still provoked a drop in Puerto Rican bonds and stocks. Reactions=Local market Around $30 billion, or about 42% of Puerto Rico's outstanding debt, is owned by residents of Puerto Rico. They and local businesses are the parties that are most affected by the government cuts and the increased taxes that have been imposed to stabilize the island's finances. Michele Caruso from CNBC reported on January 24, 2014, \\"Taxes and fees went up on nearly everything and everyone. Personal income taxes, corporate taxes, sales taxes, sin taxes, and taxes on insurance premiums were hiked or newly imposed. Retirement age for teachers was raised from as low as 47 to at least 55 for current teachers, and 62 for new teachers.\\" That is a significant cost to bear for a country with a purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita of $16,300 and with 41% of its population living below the poverty line. The legislative assembly, together with the governor, also reduced operating deficits, and reformed the public employees', teachers', and judicial pension systems. They also announced the intent to further reduce appropriations in the current fiscal year by $170 million and budget for balanced operations for the upcoming fiscal year. As another countermeasure, the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a bill on March 3, 2014, allowing the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank to issue $3.5 billion in bonds to recover its liquidity. The Governor promptly signed the bill the day after, effectively becoming law as Act 34 of 2014 (Pub.L. 2014-34). US municipal market Nearly 70% of US-based municipal bond funds own Puerto Rican bonds or have some kind of exposure to Puerto Rico. A notable cause for this tendency is the fact that Puerto Rican bonds are triple tax-exempt in all of the states regardless of where the bond holder resides. Despite the expected impact, pre-emptive measures slowed the damage of the downgrade's fallout. When the downgrade began to be perceived as imminent, investors were warned that it would affect the municipal market in general, and concerns of a worst-case default scenario were already being considered. However, by the end of February 2014, municipal bond funds that relied on specific debt had already experienced the backlash, which left portfolio managers with fewer options in the market. Organizations such as First Investors made it clear that they did not intend to invest in Puerto Rico for a prolonged period, at least until Puerto Rican bonds were restored to investment grade. Skepticism Several Puerto Rico senators have expressed that Puerto Rico's debt is simply impossible to repay and so they have stated that Puerto Rico should instead negotiate payback terms with bondholders. Others, such as economist Joaquin Villamil, have deemed it necessary for Puerto Rico to issue debt at least once more to return liquidity to the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank and thus be able to repay its debt. Some, like House Minority Whip Jennifer González, claim the crisis is mere propaganda, which is created so that the incumbent political party can enact, amend, and repeal laws that it would otherwise be unable to justify. Others, such as the President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, Eduardo Bhatia, claim the crisis was created by ruthless investors, who wish to profit from credit downgrades. Proposed solutions=Restructuring of debt The Capitol of Puerto Rico just outside Old San JuanIn June 2015, Governor Padilla announced that the Commonwealth was in a \\"death spiral\\" and \\"the debt is not payable\\". The government of Puerto Rico commissioned an analysis of its financial problems asking for solutions that resulted in the \\"Krueger Report\\" published in June 2015. The report called for structural and fiscal reforms as well as for a restructuring of outstanding debts. One month later, a report was published that rejected the need for debt restructuring. It was commissioned by a group of 34 hedge funds that specialize in distressed debt—sometimes referred to as vulture funds—who had hired economists with an IMF background. Their report indicated that Puerto Rico has a fixable deficit problem, not a debt problem. It recommended improvements to tax collection and a reduction of public spending. The report also recommended consideration of public private partnerships and the monetization of government-owned buildings and ports. The report made use of data of the Krueger Report and warned that the costs of default would be high. One of the authors opined that Puerto Rico has been \\"massively overspending on education\\". Detractors remark that Puerto Rico's spending on education is only 79% of the U.S. average per pupil while supporters remark that, when compared to Puerto Rico's GDP, such spending is extraordinarily high. In response to the hedge fund report, Víctor Suárez Meléndez, chief of staff of the governor of Puerto Rico, indicated that \\"extreme austerity [alone] is not a viable solution for an economy already on its knees\\". On October 14, 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that \\"U.S. and Puerto Rican authorities were discussing the possibility of issuing a \\"superbond\\" as part of a restructuring package\\". This plan would have a designated third party administer an account holding some of the island's tax collections and those funds would be used to pay holders of the superbond. The existing Puerto Rican bondholders would take a haircut on the value of their current bond holdings. Debt nullification Several lawmakers—such as MVC representative Manuel Natal—have proposed to audit Puerto Rico's debt to see whether some of the debt was issued illegally so that such debt can be nullified. That strategy has been used elsewhere in the United States and might be challenged by creditors. Change in autonomy According to Carl Meacham, Puerto Rico's financial problems are closely related to its ambiguous legal status under U.S. law. Expanding on that argument, Meacham posits that the government-debt crisis can be solved by enhancing Puerto Rico's autonomy or by giving the island protections and rights similar to those bestowed by statehood. Bankruptcy On June 28, 2014, Governor Padilla signed into law the \\"Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act\\", which sought to allow corporations owned by the Commonwealth, such as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority, and the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority to declare bankruptcy. However, in February 2015, U.S. District Judge Francisco Besosa found the act was void because it was preempted by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.Franklin California Tax-Free Trust v. Puerto Rico, 85 F. Supp. 3d 577 (D.P.R. 2015). In July 2015, that ruling was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, with Justice Juan R. Torruella concurring only in the judgment.Franklin California Tax-Free Trust v. Puerto Rico, 805 F.3d 322 (1st Cir. 2015). The following June, in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust (2016), that ruling was additionally affirmed by a U.S. Supreme Court in a vote of 5-2, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissenting. Puerto Rico or any of its political subdivisions and agencies cannot file for debt relief under Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code because it applies only to municipalities on the mainland. Puerto Rico's nonvoting representative in the US House of Representatives, Pedro Pierluisi, introduced H.R. 870 in February 2015 seeking to give Puerto Rico's public agencies and municipalities access to chapter 9. In the US Senate, members submitted similar legislation in July 2015, but neither bill was enacted. In December 2015, the New York Times addressed investments in Puerto Rico securities by major distressed-debt and other hedge funds. John Paulson's firm Paulson & Co., Appaloosa Management founded by David Tepper, Marathon Asset Management, BlueMountain Capital Management and Monarch Alternative Capital were amongst purchasers of bonds in March 2014. The Times also traced opposition from the hedge funds, US Senator Marco Rubio, and Jenny Beth Martin of Tea Party Patriots to Congressional bills which would expand public- authority bankruptcy restructuring options. Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act On June 30, 2016, US President Barack Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, which empowered him to appoint a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board, with ultimate control over the Commonwealth's budget and the power to negotiate the Commonwealth's debt restructuring. With the protection thaf the bill gave from lawsuits, the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, suspended payments due on July 1. PROMESA enables the island's government to enter a bankruptcy-like restructuring process and halts litigation in case of default. The task of the Oversight Board is to facilitate negotiations, or, if they fail, bring about a court-supervised process akin to a bankruptcy. The Board is also responsible for overseeing and monitoring sustainable budgets. The Oversight Board can also institute hiring freezes, prohibit the Commonwealth from entering contracts, and sell off assets such as (controversially) public parks. The Oversight Board meets in New York City. 2017 debt restructuring and effective bankruptcy La Fortaleza, the Governor of Puerto Rico's mansion, built in 1533 By mid-January 2017, the bond debt had reached $70 billion in a territory with a 45% poverty rate and a double-digit unemployment (12.4% in December 2016), more than twice the mainland US average. The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession. The Commonwealth defaulted on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. By mid-January, the cash-strapped government was having difficulty maintaining health care funding. \\"Without action before April, Puerto Rico's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico,\\" according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also stated, \\"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\\" In January 2017, the newly-elected Governor Ricardo Rosselló entered office and was expecting a $3 billion budget deficit, only to discover that the deficit was $7.5 billion. He proposed austerity measures such as cutting payments to government pensioners, who do not receive Social Security, by 10%, which prompted criticism from the island's chapter of the Service Employees International Union. Governor Rosselló discussed the situation in an interview with the international Financial Times in January and indicated that he would seek an amicable resolution with creditors and also make fiscal reforms. \\"There will be real fiscal oversight and we are willing to sit down. We are taking steps to make bold reforms.... What we are asking for is runway to establish these reforms and have Washington recognize that they have a role to play.\\" He had instructed Puerto Rican government agencies to cut operating expenses by 10% and reduce political appointees by 20%. With debt payments due, he faced the risk of a government shutdown. Initially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico's governor to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by January 28. Puerto Rico must reach restructuring deals with its creditors to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA. In late January 2017, the control board extended the deadline to the government to February 28 for the latter present a fiscal plan which including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31. Rosselló hired investment expert Rothschild & Co in January 2017 to assist in convincing creditors to take deeper losses on Puerto Rico's debts than they had publicly expected. According to reliable sources, the company also explored the possibility of convincing insurers that had guaranteed some of the bonds against default to contribute more to the restructuring. The governor also planned to negotiate restructuring of about $9 billion of electric utility debt, a plan that could result \\"in a showdown with insurers.\\" Political observers suggested that his negotiation of the electrical utility debt indicated Rosselló's intention to take a harder line with creditors. Puerto Rico received authority from the federal government to reduce its debt with legal action and this may make creditors more willing to negotiate instead of becoming embroiled in a long and costly legal battle. In late January, the Oversight Board set up under PROMESA gave the Commonwealth until February 28 to present a fiscal plan, including negotiations with creditors, to solve the problems. By the end of February, the Oversight Board's plan, with its focus on repayment of debts, was criticized by economists Joseph E. Stiglitz and Martin Guzman, who claimed that the Board lacked \\"any understanding of basic economics and democratic accountability.\\" With the Board's focus on debt service leading to a predicted 16.2% decline in gross national income for the next fiscal year with a further decline expected, \\"a social [and] economic catastrophe\\" would be \\"all but guarantee[d].\\" Stieglitz and Guzman proposed for steps to enhance economic growth, not repayments, to be at the center of a viable plan to solve the crisis. Similarly, an internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that most Puerto Rican economists rejected the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rosselló government on similar grounds. Owners of the Commonwealth's general obligation bonds, which are protected by the Puerto Rican Constitution, and Puerto Rico Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, which are paid directly into a trust, rather than the Commonwealth's treasury, conflict on the holder of the senior debt. In March 2017, Rosselló was permitted by the Oversight Board to offer the creditors a plan that would repay less than a quarter of debts. On May Day, protesting residents, angry about the proposed subsidy cuts, shouted, \\"Ricky is selling the island!\\" As soon as a court stay expired on May 2, 2017, bondholders and a bond insurer sued the Commonwealth for full and timely debt repayment. On May 3, Rosselló reacted by asking the Oversight Board to file in federal district court for debt relief under PROMESA, proceedings, which would be very similar to bankruptcy. On May 5, Chief Justice John Roberts assigned the case to Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. That day, the Puerto Rico Department of Education announced plans to close 184 schools. On May 17, 2017, Swain traveled to San Juan for the first day of hearings, and she ultimately agreed to allow the Oversight Board and the Commonwealth to pursue separate lawsuits at the same time in a joint adjudication. On July 2, 2017, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority filed for bankruptcy protections under PROMESA for its $9 billion in bond debt. On August 7, 2017, Aurelius Capital Management had Theodore Olson file another lawsuit, which now alleged that the selection of the Oversight Board violated the Appointments Clause of the US Constitution. After touring the damage from Hurricane Maria on October 3, 2017, US President Donald Trump announced: \\"They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street. We're going to have to wipe that out.\\" When markets opened the next day, the price on the Commonwealth's General Obligation bonds dropped to all-time lows of 32 cents on the dollar. Mick Mulvaney, the White House Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said that the president should not be taken literally and clarified, \\"We are not going to bail them out.\\" The Commonwealth's $123 billion liabilities from debt ($74 billion) and unfunded pension obligations ($49 billion) are much larger than the $18 billion Detroit bankruptcy, the recordholder for municipal bankruptcies conducted under Chapter 9. The debt restructuring procedure will also be unprecedented in that it is governed by Title III of PROMESA, instead of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Background The original lineup of the quartet included pianist Matthew Shipp, bassist William Parker and drummer Marc Edwards. Parker and Edwards were the rhythm section on Ware's previous 1988 trio album Passage to Music, but in 1989 Ware was looking for a pianist for adding to the mix.

It is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific and the western Atlantic Ocean. Description A colony of Perophora multiclathrata consists of slender, branching stolons, with unstalked zooids growing at intervals. Each zooid is long and has about twenty tentacles surrounding the buccal siphon, alternately long and short. The pharynx has five rows of stigmata, some of which extend from the first row into the second. The musculature in the atrial wall is distinctive with horizontal and radial elements and a circular muscle fibre surrounding the base of the atrial siphon allowing the atrium to become pouched and the atrial siphon to be pulled inward. Distribution and habitat Perophora multiclathrata has a widespread distribution in both the tropical Indo-Pacific region and the tropical western Atlantic Ocean. In the Caribbean Sea it is found in small colonies under stones on back reef flats, and in sheltered mangrove lagoons. In East Timor, from where the type specimen came, it is often found on sheltered reefs where there is little water movement.

Most commonly, these form from aldehyde and keto carboxylic acids, and the cyclic forms are furanoid (5-ring with oxygen) or pyranoid (6-ring with oxygen). The original pseudoacid to be described as such (using the German ) was levulinic acid (4-oxopentanoic acid).Bredt, J., 1886. Über Acetyllävulinsäure und die Constitution der γ-Ketonsäuren. Annalen der chemie 236, 225–240. Unlike the parent (open-form) oxocarboxylic acid, the pseudoacid has a chiral center. Levulinic acid open-cyclic interconversion The position of equilibrium in oxocarboxylic acids, toward the open form or the cyclic (pseuodacid) form, is influenced by a number of factors. In aliphatic 4- and 5-oxocarboxylic acids, intervening substituents assists in ring closure. Alkenes with the interacting groups substituted cis to each other also assists in ring closure. Aryl systems with the interacting groups substituted ortho to each other assists in ring closure. Other factors such as the gem-dialkyl effect (Thorpe–Ingold effect), electronic influences, and steric compression can also influence the open-cyclic equilibrium. Like carboxylic acids, pseudoacids have \\"pseudoacyl\\" derivatives. These include pseudoacyl halides, pseudoesters, endocyclic and exocyclic-N pseudoamides, and pseudoanhydrides. Like aldehydes and ketones, pseuodacids have \\"pseudocarbonyl\\" derivatives also.

Life Hugues Delorme was born on 10 April 1868 at Avize in the department of Marne with the name of Georges Thiebost. He first lived in Rouen where he worked as a journalist for several years before moving to Paris. From 1896 he frequented the cabarets of Montmartre and became a poet, humorist, playwright and actor. He was well known at Le Chat Noir cabaret. He joined Gardénia, a theatrical and artistic circle founded by Paul Fabre. Hugues Delorme was very tall and slender, and was nicknamed La Voltige. He participated with Paul Delmet, Gaston Montoya, Jacques Ferny and Marcel Legay in creating popular or sentimental songs that were mainly sung in the cabarets of Montmartre. Delorme was an editor of the journal Le Courrier français. He wrote two books about cartoonists, one about Georges Goursat (Sem) and the other about Carlègle (pseudonym of Charles Émile Egli). These two books were published in Paris in 1939. Delorme also wrote numerous plays, one-act pieces, reviews and some comedies and novels. He works were performed at neighborhood theaters and at café-concerts such as Le Coup de minuit. During his lifetime, he was best known for his classical poetry in octosyllables. His poetry was widely published in various periodicals, but hardly any of it was published in collections. Delorme died in 20 May 1942 and lies in the 89th division of the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Geneva, Musée d'Arte et d'Histoire. Alesso di Benozzo (1473 – 1528), also known as Alesso Gozzoli, was an Italian Renaissance painter. He was born in Pisa in 1473 and began his career as an assistant to his father, the famous Florentine Benozzo Gozzoli. In 1492 he signed the Tabernacle of the Visitation (Castelfiorentino, Museo Benozzo Gozzoli) together with his father, who headed the project, and brother, Francesco. Because of their similar styles, the individual contributions of each painter are not easy to distinguish, but the art historian Anna Padoa Rizzo has proposed that the more refined and elegant figures are by Alesso, whom documents suggest was Gozzoli's most esteemed son, and that the coarser passages are by Francesco, apparently of lesser renown. Padoa Rizzo in turn identified Alesso as the anonymous artist previously known by two names: the \\"Maestro Esiguo,\\" invented by Roberto Longhi in reference to the painter's skinny and exiguous figures, and the \\"Alunno di Benozzo,\\" literally the \\"student of Benozzo,\\" a nickname invented by Bernard Berenson. His works were also once wrongly assigned to Amedeo Laini, called Amedeo da Pistoia. Though a relatively minor painter, Alesso was an active member of Florence's painters' confraternity, the Compagnia di San Luca. From 1495 until 1497, he and his brothers undertook to finish the frescoed Maestà in the Palazzo Comunale, Pistoia, which their father left incomplete on his death in 1497. In addition to frescoes, Alesso painted many small-scale devotional pictures, often of the Virgin and Child or scenes from the Passion of Christ or the life of the Virgin. Examples include the Annunciation in New York (Metropolitan Museum of Art), the Crucifixion in Boston (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), the Deposition of Christ in Tulsa (Philbrook Museum of Art), and two similar panels of the Man of Sorrows in Princeton (Princeton University Art Museum) and Geneva (Musée d'Art et d'Histoire). He also painted altarpieces, like the Visitation in Castelfiorentino (Museo di Santa Verdiana) and Madonna and Child with Four Saints in Florence (Museo del Bigallo). A smaller scale altarpiece by Alesso is now at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. A significant number of drawings by Alesso have been identified, most by Berenson.
