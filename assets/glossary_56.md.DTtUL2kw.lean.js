History Lilian Ross Fraser and Joyce Winifred Vickery co-discovered Lomandra hystrix, which they published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, 62: 286 1937. Description The leaves are 80 cm to 100 cm long, and generally have a leaf of about 10 mm to 20 mm wide. It grows beside watercourses in upland and mountain rain forest. The plant is often used for revegetation and erosion control. The starchy, fleshy bases of the leaves are edible, tasting of raw peas. Even when the roots are exposed it will cling tenaciously in poor soils. This species is closely related to L. longifolia; the inner bract and flowers are similar, but it differs in leaf apex, lack of conspicuous marginal sclerenchyma bands on leaves, and in inflorescence branching.

Brewster is remembered today as one of the early founders of the Hinghwa Methodist Church. Early life and mission to China Born in Clark County, Ohio, Brewster graduated from Boston University in 1888 with a Doctorate in Theology. In 1889, the Methodist Episcopal Church dispatched Brewster to Singapore with the status of a missionary, however due to his difficulty in acclimatizing to that region he was redirected to the Foochow Church Mission Station instead. It was during this period at the Foochow Mission where Brewster became acquainted to Miss Elizabeth Fisher and they subsequently married. Missionary work in the Hinghwa Prefecture In 1890, Brewster was transferred to the Hinghwa (present day Putian) Prefecture to evangelize at that region. It was during this period when Brewster first began learning the local Hinghwa language and, in order to facilitate the missionary work, developed the Hinghwa Romanized alphabet. From 1892 to 1900, Brewster translated the New Testament Bible into the Hinghwa language and set up a local store known as the Hinghua Industrial Mission Press where the printing of Bibles were conducted. In his leisure time, he established facilities such as a Gospel Bookstore, Western Secondary school (still in existence today), and the Hanjiang Xingren Hospital (predecessor of the present day Hanjiang District Hospital). Brewster also created a local orphanage center, smoking rehabilitation facility, social welfare center and also established several industries such as the Xingshan Shipping Company (興善輪船公司), a Flour factory. The Brewsters also participated in the great Hinghwa revival during 1909 which left a lasting impact on Chinese Christians such as John Sung whom would later become a pastor and evangelist.Pheng Soon Thng, The Diary of John Sung: Extracts from His Journals and Notes, Pg.5 Brewster also exported local specialty products such as the Litchi chinensis to the United States and helped organize the Hinghwa church members in their plans to immigrate to the Sarawak region of Sibu beginning from 1912.The 100th Anniversary of the Hinghwa Puxian immigrants to Sibu In 1916, Brewster returned to the United States and died a few months later at the age of 53.

Lake Palace Lake Palace Lake Palace (formerly known as Jag Niwas) is a luxury hotel, which has 83 rooms and suites featuring white marble walls. The Lake Palace is located on the island of Jag Niwas in Lake Pichola, Udaipur, India, and its natural foundation spans 4 acres (16,000 m2). Built between 1743 and 1746 under the direction of the Maharana Jagat Singh II (62nd successor to the royal dynasty of Mewar) of Udaipur, the private summer resort of the erstwhile royal family has been turned into a luxury hotel. The hotel has been ranked as amongst the best luxury heritage hotels in the country. Gulab Bagh and Zoo A rose garden laid out by Maharaja Sajjan Singh is situated near the palace on the east side of Lake Pichhola. A library in the garden has a collection of ancient handwritten manuscripts and books. Some of the part of the Satyarth Prakash have been written in this library. Styarth Prakash stup is situated in Gulab Bagh. Within the garden, there is a zoo which used to have tigers, leopards, Chinkara gazelle, birds, and many wild animals, but now most of these animals have been moved to Sajjangarh Biological Park. Children can still enjoy a mini train, the track of which covers the main part of the garden and the zoo. Pichola Lake Lake Pichola, an artificial fresh water lake created in the year 1362 AD, is one of several contiguous lakes in the city. The lake was built by Banjara, a gypsy \\"Banjara\\" tribesman who transported grain, during the reign of Maharana Lakha. Later, Maharana Udai Singh, impressed by the charm of this lake with the backdrop of green hills, founded the city of Udaipur on the banks of the lake and also enlarged the Lake by constructing a stone masonry dam in the Badipol region on the shore of the lake. There are four islands on the lake: * Jag Niwas, where is built the Lake Palace * Jag Mandir, with the palace of the same name * Mohan Mandir, from where the king would watch the annual Gangaur festival celebration * Arsi Vilas, a small island which was an ammunition depot, and also a small palace Monsoon Palace Monsoon Palace at the hilltop Monsoon Palace was built in 1884 by Maharana Sajjan Singh of the Mewar Dynasty giving it the name Sajjangarh. The palace is near Fateh Sagar Lake. The palace was also used in the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy Moti Magri Atop the Moti Magri or Pearl Hill, overlooking the Fatah Sagar Lake is the memorial of the Rajput hero Maharana Pratap with a bronze statue of the Maharana astride his favourite horse, \\"Chetak\\".More details are available at Maharanapratap.net, a collection of facts and figures on Maharana Pratap and his life.

It was designed by Joseph Monier and built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 August 1998.  History  The Monier Ventilation Shafts are thought to have been constructed , as part of a system of ventilation shafts (either concrete or steel/iron) located at intervals along some of Brisbane's inner city arterial stormwater drains. Three concrete shafts survive (of at least five erected) and may be the first pre-cast reinforced concrete structures in Queensland. The Wickham Terrace shaft, on the footpath at the eastern end of Albert Park, opposite Twine Street, was one of a pair, the other having been erected just inside the park, opposite Lilley Street, but since removed. A concrete shaft of identical dimensions exists on the footpath of St Paul's Terrace, opposite Gloucester Street. Both the Wickham Terrace and St Paul's Terrace shafts appear to have been associated with the first Spring Hill stormwater drainage system, laid in the 1880s. A third shaft (Monier Ventilation Shaft 3), of similar but smaller dimensions, exists on the footpath near the former Queensland Primary Producers' Woolstore No. 8, in Florence Street, Teneriffe. Stormwater drains were laid in Florence and Ethel streets in mid-1904, and the concrete ventilation shaft at the east end of the Florence Street drain may have been constructed shortly afterwards. In the 19th century, the distinction between drainage and sewerage was not well defined. Drains were described as sewers and they received a combination of sullage, roof and surface run-off. They relied on rainwater for flushing, and discharged to the nearest watercourse. When Brisbane acquired municipal status in late 1859, there was no system of drainage or sewerage in the town. Most people dumped refuse in the creeks and channels, trusting that stormwater would carry it away to the river, and for some years the Municipal Council considered drainage and sewerage as one and the same thing. However, from about 1868 the Council adopted the policy of \\"rainfall to the river\\" and \\"sewerage to the land\\", developing a city drainage scheme to carry off stormwater and an earth closet sanitary service. The Brisbane Drainage Act of 1875, under which the colonial government agreed to set aside crown land for sale to finance Brisbane's drainage scheme, provided the impetus for construction of Brisbane's early arterial stormwater drains. The systems were designed by the colonial government's Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, William David Nisbet, and carried out by government contractors under government supervision. Upon completion they became the property and responsibility of the Brisbane Municipal Council, which was responsible also for laying branch drains. By 1878, the inner city was drained by three separate systems: * the Frog's Hollow system - a main drain down Albert and Margaret Streets with branches laid by the Brisbane Municipal Council * the Adelaide Street-Creek Street system, which drained the centre of the town from Makerston Street to Queen Street and the lower sections of Elizabeth and Charlotte Streets * the Makerston Street system, which served the area between Makerston Street and Petrie Terrace, and between Wickham Terrace and College Road and the Brisbane River Between 1879 and 1886 the Brisbane Municipal Council, with government loans, developed an arterial drainage system for the densely populated suburbs of Spring Hill and Fortitude Valley (even though Fortitude Valley then lay outside the Brisbane town boundary). Much of this work comprised open drains, which were covered in the late 1890s. South Brisbane and Kangaroo Point drainage systems were constructed in 1885-86. In the late 1880s, the Brisbane Municipal Council drained parts of New Farm, and a drainage system for Petrie Terrace, begun in 1883, was completed in the late 1880s. By 1890, the Brisbane Municipal Council had completed an arterial drainage scheme for the city core, at a total cost of nearly . The densely populated Booroodabin Division was annexed to the Municipality of Brisbane in 1903, and in 1908 a loan was secured to enable the Council to complete the drainage of Merthyr, New Farm, Teneriffe, Bowen Hills, Mayne and Newstead by the end of 1909. Without a proper sewerage system, Brisbane residents still tended to dispose of household and trade waste into the stormwater drainage systems. This led to the chronic pollution of local creeks, and foul smells emanating from the stormwater drains. Prior to bacterial theory being widely accepted, such miasma was thought to cause disease. The situation was compounded in 1900 with the arrival of bubonic plague in Australia, carried by rats aboard ships arriving from foreign ports. The first case of human plague in Sydney was reported in January 1900, and in Brisbane (a day and a half away by steamer) on 27 April 1900. Between 1900 and 1909, plague broke out in most of Queensland's ports, galvanising the State into developing tighter controls over public health and sanitation. In the early 20th century, the Commissioner of Public Health, using the strong coercive powers given to him under the provisions of the Health Act of 1900, required the Brisbane Municipal Council to erect ventilators in city streets to remove foul and unhealthy smells from the drainage systems. In 1900, the Council called tenders for the construction and erection of a ventilating shaft at Thorn Street, Kangaroo Point. No trace remains of this vent, except for its design, which was in the Monier system of re-inforced concrete, and identical with that of the vents that have survived on Wickham Terrace and St Paul's Terrace. The Monier system of reinforced concrete (invented by Frenchman Joseph Monier and patented in 1867) was introduced to Australia in the early 1890s by WJ Baltzer, a New South Wales engineer. Monier's was the first true reinforced concrete, based on calculations which ensured that the steel was dispersed so as to take tension and shear forces. Baltzer, in association with contracting engineers Carter Gummow and Co. of Sydney, gained the Australian rights to this innovative fabric. The company constructed the first Monier system structure (a small arch for a storm water culvert) in Burwood, New South Wales, in 1894 and a sewer aqueduct linking the Sydney suburbs of Annandale and Balmain in 1895. The first use of the Monier system in Victoria was in 1897 with the Anderson Street Bridge over the Yarra River, designed and constructed by Carter Gummow & Co. Carter Gummow and Co. began manufacture of Monier pipes in Sydney in 1897, and John Monash's Reinforced Concrete & Monier Pipe Construction Co. commenced production in Melbourne in 1903. During the financial year 1903-04, the Brisbane Municipal Council authorised the spending of on erecting sewer (drain) ventilating shafts wherever they were urgently needed. It is thought that the surviving concrete ventilation shafts were constructed in consequence.  Description  The three surviving concrete ventilation shafts are located in Brisbane's inner city suburbs of Spring Hill and Teneriffe. Two are in Spring Hill - one at the eastern end of Albert Park, on the footpath on Wickham Terrace opposite Twine Street; another on the footpath on St Paul's Terrace, opposite Gloucester Street. A third is located on the footpath in Florence Street, Teneriffe, west of the intersection with Macquarie Street. They ventilate stormwater drains rather than sewers. The Spring Hill ventilators are located on ridges, but the Teneriffe ventilator is on low ground near the Brisbane River. It is not known what rationale was adopted in deciding where the vents were to be placed. The ventilators are constructed of reinforced concrete, hexagonal in shape, with simple ornamentation at half height and apex. The Spring Hill ventilators are tall with a base width of . They have a wall thickness of at the base, tapering to at the top. The Teneriffe ventilator is of slightly smaller dimensions. All three ventilators are thought to have been constructed in accordance with the patented Monier ventilation system for venting public sewers and drains, and probably pre-cast in an hexagonal mould, with the top face open.  Heritage listing  Monier Ventilation Shaft 1 (Spring Hill) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 August 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Monier Ventilation Shafts, constructed , are important in illustrating late 19th/early 20th century attitudes toward public health and sanitation, and survive as visible evidence of Brisbane's early and extensive stormwater drainage scheme and venting system. The three surviving concrete shafts are thought to be the first pre-cast reinforced concrete structures in Queensland, and examples of the earliest application of the Monier system of reinforced concrete construction in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. They provide rare surviving evidence of this early use of true reinforced concrete, and are significant as indicators of the technically advanced state of municipal engineering and construction in Brisbane at the turn of the 20th century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. They have the potential to contribute further to our understanding of: * community attitudes toward public health in the late 19th/early 20th centuries * Brisbane's early stormwater drainage scheme * early pre-cast reinforced concrete technology in Queensland.

It was built in the 1860s for Thomas McWhinney. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001.  History  The brick cottage at 59 Birley Street, Spring Hill, was likely erected in the mid-1860s for Thomas McWhinney, plasterer. This part of Spring Hill was surveyed officially into suburban allotments in 1856, and was soon subdivided for closer residential settlement by speculative land owners. Along with Kangaroo Point and Petrie Terrace, Spring Hill was among the earliest of Brisbane's dormitory suburbs, attracting middle class residents to the high land along the ridges, and the working class to the hollows in between: Hanly's Hollow (between Wickham Terrace and Leichhardt Street), Spring Hollow (between Leichhardt Street and Gregory Terrace), and York's Hollow (to the north of Gregory Terrace - an area occupied by a number of brick-makers in the 1850s and 1860s). The site on which the brick cottage is located was part of a larger parcel of land ( - suburban portion 179, parish of North Brisbane) with a frontage to Leichhardt Street, purchased from the Crown in May 1860 by Patrick Byrne of Brisbane for the sum of . Almost immediately Byrne subdivided this portion into 10 subdivisions around a central access road (Birley Street) off Leichhardt Street. At this period, Birley Street did not extend through to Wickham Terrace. The two subdivisions at the top of the hill, with frontages to Leichhardt Street, comprised each, but the remainder, running down the hill each side of Birley Street into Hanly's Hollow, were each just under . The first transfer was recorded in August 1861 and all but one of the subdivisions sold in the period 1861-65. By the census of September 1871, there were 12 houses in Birley Street, all inhabited, accommodating 58 persons. Many of these houses appear to have been rental properties, and attracted mostly working class tenants such as bootmakers, carpenters, labourers, mariners, plasterers, printers, storemen and a number of widows, who were likely existing on modest incomes. In September 1865, Patrick Byrne sold subdivision 3 of suburban portion 179 () to Thomas McWhinney (sometimes McWhinny or McWhinnie) of Brisbane, for the sum of . This is the site of the present brick cottage. It is not known if a house was extant on the land at the time of sale, but the price suggests not. In April 1866 McWhinney took out a mortgage of on his Birley Street property from the Queensland Building Society No.2, of which he was a member. The timing, within a year of acquiring the land, suggests that the mortgage was used to help finance construction of the brick cottage. McWhinney was occupying the land in October 1872, when he applied to bring his property under the provisions of the Real Property Act of 1861, and is listed in the 1874 Post Office Directory as resident in Birley Street. McWhinney and his wife Isabella Todd and family had arrived in New South Wales by 1858, and moved to Brisbane in the early 1860s, where Thomas, who was a plasterer by trade, gained employment with James Campbell. He worked for Campbell for 26 years until his retirement , for most of that time as a foreman, supervising the plastering and designing the mouldings for most of the principal construction work undertaken by Campbell during that period. The cottage at 59 Birley Street is constructed in Flemish bond brick-on-edge ('rat-trap' bond), a form of construction used in other Spring Hill buildings of the 1860s and 1870s (such as Moody's Cottages in Rogers Street). It was a faster and cheaper form of construction, usually restricted to working-class homes and small workshops and stores. At 59 Birley Street the exterior brick work was finished with tuckpointing and the internal fireplace was plastered, which may be explained by the connection with McWhinney. By 1883 the McWhinneys had left Birley Street and had moved to Arthur Street in Fortitude Valley by 1885, but McWhinney retained his Birley Street land, likely renting out the brick cottage. In 1885, McWhinney also gained title the adjacent subdivision 6 on the northern side of his Birley Street allotment. In the 1880s there were only four or five houses along this side of Birley Street (which did not extend past Lilley Street at that stage), and it is possible (but not confirmed) that in the late 1880s, 59 Birley Street was known as Jireh Cottage, occupied by compositor Thomas Wright. In May 1894, title to subdivisions 3 and 6 was transferred to Mary Ann McWhinney of Brisbane, spinster, and in August 1896 Thomas McWhinney, aged nearly 77, died. In the mid-1890s Birley Street was extended through to Wickham Terrace and in May 1900 subdivisions 3 and 6 of suburban portion 179 were transferred from Mary Ann McWhinney to Richard Gailey, the well-known Brisbane architect, who is appears to have developed these two blocks with the construction of four timber houses for rental purposes. The existing houses on this land, one of which is now connected via an enclosed verandah to the front of the brick cottage at 59 Birley Street, appear to date from this period. By 1913, 59 Birley Street was occupied by Mrs Jane Collins. A Brisbane City Council Water Supply and Sewerage Detail Plan dated 1914 indicates a structure at 59 Birley Street which correlates with the present timber house attached to the brick cottage at the rear. In June 1916, title to subdivisions 3 and 6 of suburban portion 179 was transferred from Richard Gailey to his daughter, Evadne Jane Gailey of Brisbane. The houses on these blocks remained rental properties, 59 Birley Street attracting mainly widows. In 1952 both subdivisions passed to Alfred Roberts, and following his death in 1979, was sold in 1983 to the Queensland Master Builders Association (Union of Employers), who have retained them since as rental properties.  Description  59 Birley Street is located on the western side of Birley Street, about two-thirds of the way down toward the hollow which runs between Leichhardt Street and Wickham Terrace (Hanly's Hollow). It contains two principal structures: a high-set timber residence at the front of the block, attached via an enclosed timber verandah to a s brick cottage at the rear. The s cottage is a small, rectangular, two-roomed brick structure with gable roof and close eaves. It rests on stone (porphyry or Brisbane tuff) foundations, low at the back and approximately above ground at the front, where the land slopes. The stone blocks are roughly dressed and laid in courses, the more regular blocks placed along the exposed southern side. The roof is clad with corrugated iron, with the original shingle battens surviving beneath this. The red face brick is laid in Flemish bond but brick- on-edge ('rat- trap' bond) - a faster and cheaper method of construction often used for working-class construction in Brisbane in the 1860s and 1870s. There are remnants of white tuckpointing on the bricks closest to the eaves, but the lower sections of the western and southern external walls have been badly repaired with later cement grouting. The northern external wall has been clad with a recent \\"pebble-dash\\" render. The front (eastern) wall has been painted and with the enclosing of the front verandah, is no longer exposed to the elements. It has two window openings symmetrically positioned either side of a central doorway. The western wall, built almost on the boundary of the allotment, has no fenestration. A chimney top, nicely detailed with decorative brickwork, rises above the roof at the southern end, but the main shaft of the chimney is internal. The interior of the cottage comprises two small rooms. The former front entrance (the door has been removed) opens from a now enclosed timber verandah into the southern room, which is larger than the northern room and contains a fireplace and chimney. It is likely this room functioned as kitchen, living room and dining room. There are two windows to this room - one opening onto the front (eastern) verandah and retaining its original double-hung sash window, and the other a later opening in the southern wall beside the fireplace. The northern room is accessed from the southern room and has no external access. It originally had two windows, one in the north wall and the other in the eastern wall opening onto the verandah. The original sash window in the north wall has been replaced with louvres, and the window in the eastern wall has been in-filled with fibrous cement sheeting. Both rooms retain their early skirting boards and the interior of the cottage is lined with plaster - walls, ceilings, partitioning wall and chimney. Much of this is early lathe and plaster work and early cement render, but sections of the ceilings have been replaced with recent plasterboard sheeting. The floor boards are of pine, some of this early and secured with hand-made nails. The floor in the northern room has been replaced. The front verandah was likely replaced with the construction of the attached timber house, and is now enclosed. The northern section of this verandah has been partitioned and enclosed as a bathroom. The southern section is now an internal passageway with an external door at the southern end. This verandah links the brick cottage to the timber house. The house is a high-set, timber- framed, weatherboard clad structure with a corrugated iron hipped and gabled roof. It has a front extended gable and small front verandah which has since been enclosed. In plan, the timber house has a central corridor opening off the enclosed front verandah. On the northern side of the corridor are three rooms. On the southern side there are two. The room at the rear on the southern side appears to have been partitioned to create a corridor through to the back door which opens onto the enclosed front verandah of the brick cottage. Floorboards throughout are the original, likely pine. Rooms throughout are lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove boards and the ceilings are also tongue and groove. The house retains its original joinery, including doors and window frames, some of which are sash and some casements. All the internal doors have fanlights above. The place is remarkably intact considering that it has been occupied as a rental property for approximately a century. A yard adjoining the cottage on the southern side contains a number of archaeological deposits—horse shoes, bottles, coins, broken pottery, shells and handmade nails have been found here—and there is sub-strata evidence of an early brick pathway to the cottage.  Heritage listing  McWhinneys Brick Cottage was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. McWhinney's Brick Cottage at 59 Birley Street, Spring Hill, erected probably in the mid-1860s, has high historical significance and is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history. It is associated with the mid-19th century settlement of Spring Hill as one of Brisbane's earliest dormitory suburbs, and illustrates the nature of residential subdivisions and construction in Brisbane at this period - particularly the use of brick and stone as distinct from timber. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The brick cottage is a rare surviving example of its type and age in Brisbane, and is particularly significant for its brick-on-edge construction, for the intactness of many of the finishes, and for what it reveals of mid-19th century working-class living conditions. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Archaeological deposits in the grounds have the potential to reveal information since its non-indigenous occupation in the 1860s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The brick cottage is a rare surviving example of its type and age in Brisbane, and is particularly significant for its brick-on-edge construction, for the intactness of many of the finishes, and for what it reveals of mid-19th century working-class living conditions. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has aesthetic value engendered by the materials, form, scale and setting of the brick cottage.

In 1992, Runsvengruppen bought Överskottsbolaget with its nine stores, and later changed the retail name for all stores of the group to Överskottsbolaget (English translation: The surplus company) or ÖoB for short. The seemingly superfluous o between Ö and B was added as ÖB is short for Överbefälhavare, or Commander-in-chief, and is thus prohibited for use as a company name. = Överskottsbolaget = Överskottsbolaget first came about in 1960 when the Swedish army quartermasters (Försvarets Fabriksverk, FFV) started selling surplus items, hence the name (överskott means surplus) from the Swedish army directly to the public.

After a distinguished career as a ballet dancer and teacher, he became widely known and respected as a historian and archivist. He is celebrated as a leading figure in the dance world of Canada.Kathryn Greenaway, \\"Vincent Warren,\\" in Encyclopedia of Theatre Dance in Canada / Encyclopédie de la Danse Théâtrale au Canada (Toronto: Dance Collection Danse Press, 2000). Early life, education, and training Vincent de Paul Warren was born in Jacksonville, Florida. He and his fraternal twin Denis were the youngest of their parents' fourteen children. Influenced by his mother's love of opera and music, Vincent was a sensitive boy, receptive to what he has called \\"a fantasy life of beauty.\\" At age ten, he saw the ballet movie The Red Shoes (1948) and discovered his future profession. At eleven, he began taking ballet classes with Betty Hyatt Ogilvie, a former Balanchine dancer. His twin brother Denis was drawn to the Roman Catholic church and at thirteen left home to join the clergy. Vincent, however, continued his dance training throughout his teenage years. He graduated from high school at eighteen, and soon he, too, left home, headed for New York City with a letter of introduction to Igor Schwezoff, a Russian-trained teacher at the American Ballet Theater School. He was given a scholarship to study at the school, where he excelled in classes. As a promising student, he was soon offered another scholarship, at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, where Antony Tudor was teaching. At age nineteen, in 1957, he auditioned for a position in the company at the Met and was hired as a member of the corps de ballet.Victor Swoboda, \\"Vincent Warren: An Artist of Compassion,\\" Dance Collection Danse, no. 72 (Fall, 2012). Ballet dancer Warren danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet for two years, 1957–59, during which time he took the opportunity to expand his training with leading teachers in New York City. In dance classes with Merce Cunningham and James Waring, he became adept in the expressive styles of modern dance while continuing to study classical ballet technique with Igor Schwezoff, Anatol Oboukoff, and Antony Tudor. In 1959-60, he danced with the Santa Fe Opera Ballet and then the Pennsylvania Ballet, based in Philadelphia. In 1961, he joined Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montréal, where, except for dancing as guest artist with Ballet Nacional de Guatemala (1963) and seasons with the Théâtre Français de la Danse in Paris (1969–70) and the Cologne Opera Ballet (1970–71), he remained until his retirement from the stage in 1979.Michael Crabb, \\"Warren, Vincent,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 6, p. 364. After more than a decade of living and dancing in Canada, he became a Canadian citizen in 1973.Curriculum vitae Vincent Warren, C.M. in the archives of Dance Collection Danse, Toronto, and the Bibliothèque de la Danse Vincent-Warren, Montréal. A principal source of information given herein, used by permission of the subject. =Repertoire= With Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, Warren danced leading roles in many classical, romantic, neoclassical, and contemporary works.Curriculum vitae Vincent Warren, C.M. Among them were Albrecht in Giselle, Siegfried in Le Lac des Cygnes (Swan Lake), the Poet in Les Sylphides, and Drummer Boy and First Cadet in Bal des Cadets (Graduation Ball), David Lichine's merry romp at a girls' school celebration. He also appeared in principal roles in George Balanchine's Allegro Brillante, Divertimento no. 15, The Four Temperaments, Serenade, and Theme and Variations. Notably, Warren created many roles for the artistic director and resident choreographer of the company, Ludmilla Chiriaeff and Fernand Nault.Crabb, \\"Warren, Vincent,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998). He danced principal male roles in Chiriaeff's Bagatelle (aka Jeux d'Arlequin), Cendrillon (Cinderella), Mémoires de Camille, Pierrot de la Lune, Quatrième Concert Royal, and Suite Canadienne, among others. Her penultimate choreographic work was Artère (1976), a solo she made especially for him, set to music by Gabriel Charpentier. In Nault's productions, Warren danced leading roles in Carmina Burana, Casse-Noisette (The Nutcracker), Hip and Straight, Pas Rompu (Not Broken), and the hugely successful Tommy, set to the rock opera by The Who. In works by other contemporary choreographers, Warren was cast in leading roles in Catulli Carmina and Villon by John Butler, L'Oiseau de Feu (The Firebird) by Maurice Béjart, Icare by Lucas Hoving, Aureole by Paul Taylor, and Les Noces by Lar Lubovitch. In the ballets of Brian Macdonald, Warren starred in Diabelli Variations, Double Quartet, Romeo and Juliet, and Tam Ti Delam, set to a Québécois folk song by Gilles Vigneault. He was especially acclaimed for his interpretation of the title role in Macdonald's Adieu Robert Schumann, created in 1979 for his farewell performance, with ballerina Annette av Paul dancing as Clara Schumann and famed Canadian contralto Maureen Forrester singing Clara's reminiscences.Curriculum vitae Vincent Warren, C.M. Reviewing the performance, CBC Radio's Kati Vita wrote: \\"Vincent Warren blazes through the work like a slender crimson flame and compels such attention [that] one is oblivious to all else when he is on stage.\\"Kena Herod, \\"Vincent Warren . . . Danseur, professeur de danse, historien de la danse et conservateur de la Bibliothèque de la danse.\\" http://www.bibliodanse.ca. Retrieved January 21. 2015. Warren's curiosity about all forms of kinetic artistry led him to the postmodern experimentation at Judson Dance Theater in New York City, where he appeared in performances with James Waring and Aileen Passloff from 1959-64.Norma McLain Stoop, \\"Spotlight on Vincent Warren,\\" Dance Magazine (New York), August 1973. In Montréal, he discovered similar avant-garde dancers at work. While remaining a principal dancer with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, he danced with Le Groupe de Danse Moderne de Montréal, a company formed by Françoise Riopelle and Jeanne Renaud, and, on numerous occasions, with Le Groupe de la Place Royale, directed by Jeanne Renaud and Peter Boneham.Sara Porter, Peter in Process: Peter Boneham's Sixty Years in Dance (Toronto: Dance Collection Danse Press, 2010). With his varied training, he found that he could perform Renaud's modern minimalism with the same ease and precision he demonstrated in classical ballets. Among other works, he danced leading roles in Renaud's Blanc sur Blanc (1964) and Phases et Reseaux (1965).\\"Jeanne Renaud: Interdisciplinary Innovation; Le Groupe de la Place Royale, 1966-1971.\\" http://www.dcd.ca/exhibitions/renaud. Retrieved January 21, 2015. Some twenty years later, during the 1987 Festival de Nouvelle Danse, Warren appeared in Paul-André Fortier's Chaleurs and showed that his command of modern dance technique had not faded.Herod, \\"Vincent Warren,\\" http://bibliodanse.ca. Retrieved January 23, 2015. On television, Warren performed on many shows originating in Canada and France. In Montréal, he appeared numerous times in works by Chiriaeff, Todd Bolender, and Renaud on Les Beaux Dimanches (Beautiful Sundays) and L'Heure du Concert (The Concert Hour), which were broadcast bilingually by Société Radio-Canada across the country. On film, Warren can be seen dancing with Margaret Mercier in Norman McLaren's Pas de deux (1968), winner of seventeen awards in experimental filmmaking, including the 1969 award for best animated film by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. More recently, he also appeared in two compelling documentary films: Marie Brodeur's Danseur à tout prix (2002) and Marie Beaulieu's Les Météores: Vincent Warren, un temps en mouvements (2011). In 2016, a documentary on Warren was produced by TAP Film Inc and La Compagnie de la Marie, A Man of Dance. The film, directed by Marie Brodeur, won the Best Canadian Film at the International Art Film Festival (FIFA) in Montreal, Canada. =Technique and style= As a performer, Warren was known as a lyrical and romantic dancer, valued for his charisma, theatricality, and vivid stage presence. Although he possessed a sound classical ballet technique, he was not a bravura dancer. Spectacular feats of athleticism were not his forte, but he was a strong and attentive partner in classical roles and was favored by many ballerinas. His partners included such international stars as Ana Cardus, Janine Charrat, Alexandra Radius, Claire Sombert, and Ghislaine Thesmar as well as Canadian ballerinas Irene Apinee, Melissa Hayden, Veronique Landory, Andrée Millaire, Sonia Taverner, and Sonia Vartanian. Warren's looks, physique, and bearing made him an ideal interpreter of classical and romantic roles.Crabb, \\"Vincent de Paul Warren,\\" in The Canadian Encyclopedia (2011). As Albrecht, his partnership with German-born Christa Mertins in Giselle was highly acclaimed, especially in the ethereal, ghostly sequences in act 2.Swoboda, \\"Vincent Warren: An Artist of Compassion,\\" 2012. Warren was also celebrated in contemporary works that require emotive, expressive dancing. In London, he won high critical praise for his performance in John Butler's Catulli Carmina, set to Carl Orff's scenic cantata of the lyrical texts of the Latin poet Catullus.Hood, \\"Vincent Warren,\\" http://www.bibliodanse.ca. Retrieved January 22, 2015. Montréal critics praised him especially in roles created for him in a balletic modern idiom by Fernand Nault. Three works with religious and spiritual references were Gehenne (1965), Cérémonie (1972), and Cantique des Cantiques (Song of Songs, 1974).Iro Valasakis Tembeck, Dancing in Montreal: Seeds of a Choreographic History. Studies in Dance History, vol. 5.2 (Madison, Wis., 1994). In Gehenne set to music by Alvin Etler and named for a biblical place of extreme suffering, Warren was able to express his deep grief at the death of New York City poet Frank O'Hara, the \\"love of his life,\\" who died after a vehicle accident on a Fire Island beach in the summer of 1966.Brad Gooch, City Poet: The Life and Times of Frank O'Hara (New York: Knopf, 1993). Includes a full account of the twenty-one-month relationship of O'Hara and Warren. In Cérémonie, a rock mass that recalls Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting of the Last Supper of Jesus, and Cantique des Cantiques, inspired by the biblical Song of Solomon, celebrating sexual love, Warren drew upon his fundamental artistic vision: to give meaning to movement.Swoboda, \\"Vincent Warren: An Artist of Compassion\\", 2012. Later life and careers Following his retirement from Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1979, Warren soon put his dance talents and broad knowledge of dance history to use as he embarked on what would become multiple careers as teacher, lecturer, librarian, and archivist. =Teacher and lecturer= At the invitation of Madame Chiriaeff, director of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, Warren began teaching classes in ballet technique to teenagers in the company's affiliated school, the École Supérieure de Danse du Québec, in 1979. As his teaching skills grew, he expanded his schedule to include classes in male variations and partnering, which became popular with advanced students. He conducted his classes in the formal manner traditional in all ballet schools, but his cheerful disposition and good humor in giving technical corrections to his students lent much to his effectiveness as a teacher. He continued to teach at the school until 1992. When the instructor of dance history at the school departed, Chiriaeff asked Warren to replace him, despite the fact that he had no formal education in the field. She knew, however, that Warren had been collecting books, prints, and magazines about dance for years and that he had developed an encyclopedic knowledge. Soon after he began teaching technique classes, in 1979, Warren undertook the role of dance historian with enthusiasm and began to formulate his own system of teaching the subject. In the course of time, he was recognized by academics as a brilliant autodidact. He taught and lectured on dance history in English and French at all four universities in Montréal and at many Canadian dance institutions. His courses at McGill University (1988–1995) and at Les Ateliers de Danse Moderne de Montréal (1989–1999) were well-attended, as were his lectures at Concordia University, Ottawa University, Université de Montréal, Université du Québec à Montréal, the Musée National des Beaux Arts du Québec, the Musée des Beaux Arts de Montréal, the National Theatre School of Canada, the Banff Center for the Arts, the McCord Museum, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. In 1999, Warren was invited to lecture at four cities in India: Delhi, Hyderabad, Madras, and Bangalore. His lecture \\"Abhinaya in Ballet,\\" on the Indian concept of the art of expression, won the prize for best presentation at the Natya Kala Conference held annually at Madras. His lecture \\"Yearning for the Spiritual Ideal: The Influence of India on Western Dance, 1626-2003,\\" was published in Sruti (December 2000), an English-language monthly magazine on Indian performing arts, and in Dance Research Journal (2006).Vincent Warren, \\"Yearning for the Spiritual Ideal: The Influence of India on Western Dance, 1626-2003,\\" Dance Research Journal, 38.1/2 (Summer-Winter 2006), 97-114. Notable among his other lecture topics are the seasons of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, 1909–1929; the Ballet de l'Opéra de Paris at the time of Degas; and the Imperial Russian Ballet at the time of Fabergé. Warren continued to teach dance history at the École Supérieure de Ballet du Québec (so renamed in 2010) until shortly before his death. =Librarian and archivist= While he continued to teach classes at the École Supérieure, Warren volunteered to run the school's small dance library, thus beginning his fourth career. Despite a limited budget, he installed proper book shelves, updated the cataloging system, allowed books to circulate, and began a vigorous campaign of acquisitions to enlarge the library's holdings. Eventually, he donated his own sizeable collection of dance materials, sought donations from friends in the dance world, and continued to purchase books, videos, prints, photographs, programs, and dance memorabilia.Vincent Warren, \\"Archives of the Dance du Québec,\\" Dance Research 13 (Winter 1995), 89-94. He was officially appointed curator of the library in 1982 and served in that capacity for twenty-four years, until 2006. Now named the Bibliothèque de la Danse Vincent-Warren, in his honor, it is the largest dance library in Canada. =Related activities= During his later years, Warren was active in numerous dance-related organizations in Québec and elsewhere. He was a member of the board of directors of the Dance in Canada Association from 1979 to 1983 and was its chairman from 1981 to 1982. He also served on the board of directors of the Regroupment des Professionels de la Danse du Québec from 1986 to 1990 and as its president for the 1987-1988 term. Subsequently, he was a member of the Arts Council of the Montreal Urban Community (1993–1999), in which he took an active role. For the dance section of the Canada Council, he served on the Committee on Archives and Documentation, and he continues to serve on many artistic juries for the Canada Council and for Québec's Conseil des Arts et Lettres. He has also served as a judge for dance competitions such as the Rencontres Chorégraphiques, held at Bagnolet, France, and the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur and the International Festival de Danse Encore in Québec. Awards and honours In recognition of his accomplishments, Warren received a Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, the Dance in Canada Service Award in 1984, and the Prix Denise-Pelletier in 1992. The Queen's Jubilee Medal was awarded for his contributions to the performing arts in Canada. The Pelletier prize is one of the Prix du Québec lifetime achievement awards given annually by the provincial government. In 2004, Warren was named a member of the Order of Canada. In 2012, he was among the recipients of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, created to honour significant achievements and contributions to national culture by Canadian citizens.Curriculum vitae Vincent Warren, C.M.

It took place following the death of the incumbent Whig Member of Parliament, John Halliday. The by-election was contested by Robert Maxwell on behalf of the Whigs, and Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet for the Tories. Maxwell was elected with a majority of 56. The election had over 700 rejected votes, and the result caused rioting in Taunton, during which two people were killed. The election was fiercely contested, and both sides incurred great expenses during the campaign. There was not another contested election in Taunton for almost twenty years, and during that time the Taunton Market House Society was set up with the aim of preventing the bad blood of a contested election, and to spend money that would have otherwise been spent on campaigning on improving the town. Maxwell remained as one of Taunton's members of parliament until 1768. Background =Vacancy and nominations= In the mid-18th century, the parliamentary constituency of Taunton, which had an electorate of around 500, returned predominantly Whig members of parliament, partly due to an agreement between Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont and the local Dissenters; Lord Egremont, the chief landowner in the borough, would nominate a candidate for one of the two seats, while the Dissenters would name the second. Nationally, parliament had been controlled by the Whigs since 1715, in what was dubbed the \\"Whig Supremacy\\" by Basil Williams. At the 1754 general election, Lord Egremont put forward his brother-in-law, George Carpenter, 3rd Baron Carpenter, while the Dissenters nominated one of their own, John Halliday. The pair were elected unopposed. Two months after the election, on 8 June 1754, Halliday died, resulting in a by-election being called to fill the vacant seat. Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet, the candidate for the Tories The Dissenters proposed Robert Webb, who had previously served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754, to fill the vacancy. The recent history of the elections in Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered: the last contested election had been in 1741. That however proved not to be the case, and a group of Tories put forward their own candidate, Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon. Webb did not want the expense of a contested election, and withdrew, leaving the Dissenters without a candidate. Unable to find a suitable candidate, the Dissenters appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest. The Mayor, Henry Manly, was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, to try and secure a candidate. Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle did not want the seat to go to a Tory, and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account (more accurately the King's private money, a fund which was not accountable to Parliament). Eventually, through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle, Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate. Maxwell offered to spend up to £3,000 on the election, in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund. =Candidates= John Pole was the only son of Sir William Pole, 4th Baronet. The family owned the Shute House estate in east Devon, and had returned six generations of members of parliament, including John Pole's father. He had inherited the estate, and the baronetcy upon his father's death in 1741. Robert Maxwell was the oldest son of John Maxwell, 1st Baron Farnham, an Irish politician and peer. Robert had been a member of the Parliament of Ireland since 1743 for the constituency of Lisburn. He had not stood for the British parliament during the 1754 general election, though he was by that time almost certainly resident in England. Result When Halliday died in June, parliament was in recess. As a result of this, a writ could not be issued until parliament reconvened in the winter. This extended the election campaign to run for six months, causing major disruption to the wool trade in the town. In his History of Taunton, Joshua Toulmin reported that the length of the campaigning allowed \\"the display of every manoeuvre, and the exertion of every power, by which the parties could counteract each other's views.\\" A lot of money was spent on both sides of the election; in addition to the £3,000 which Maxwell said he was willing to spend, the government put forward £3,675 of secret service money for his campaign. Both men had plates and mugs made which were given free to the voters, generally full of food and drink. A number of delft plates bearing the inscription \\"Sir John Pole for ever\\" still exist, and one such plate sold for over £2,000 in 2011. A drinking glass with a similar inscription is housed at the British Museum in London. The public houses became aligned to one of the two candidates, and much of the campaign money was placed into these to gain their support. Toulmin lamented that \\"the houses of entertainment were kept open during all this time; [...] habits of idleness and licentiousness were formed.\\" In a letter to Lord Sackville, Maxwell wrote that the election campaign involved \\"a great deal of smoking, some drinking, and kissing some hundreds of women.\\" Maxwell travelled down to Taunton in August to contest the seat, and the vacancy was nationally advertised in October. Despite this, the voting did not commence until 10 December 1754. The voting ran for thirteen days, and closed on 24 December; Maxwell received 198 votes to Pole's 142, giving Maxwell a majority of 56. During the course of the voting, over 700 votes were discounted, and it has been referred to as being \\"notoriously corrupt\\". When the result was announced, the public showed \\"their displeasure by assaulting the friends of Mr Maxwell.\\" Maxwell himself had to be escorted back to where he was staying, but during the rioting that ensued, the houses of those known to support Maxwell were attacked. The Derby Mercury reported that Robert Pearsall, a Dissenter minister who had been prominent in Maxwell's campaign, was threatened with having his house pulled down and being sacrificed. Two people, a man and a woman, were killed during the rioting, which prompted two troops of dragoons to be sent to the town, placed at the command of the Mayor, in case of emergency. One of the murderers was caught and sent to the County Jail in Ilchester, but the other escaped. Aftermath Maxwell, who became the 2nd Baron Farnham upon his father's death in 1759, and then Viscount Farnham in 1760, was returned unopposed at the 1761 general election. He pressed for a position in parliament, suggesting \\"being in the Admiralty or being paymaster of the pensions.\\" However, this desire was only because he thought that such a position would provide a stepping stone to a higher peerage, and he was made the Earl of Farnham, in the Irish peerage in 1763. He initially stood at the general election in 1768, but withdrew from the election in the face of strong opposition. The Market House Society was formed in Taunton in 1763 by a group who wished to avoid a repeat of the expensive and violent election in 1754. They made it their aim to \\"prevent the evils and drunkenness of a contested election\\", and vowed to spend the money that would have otherwise been spent on campaigning on improving Taunton. They put forward two candidates in 1768, who after the withdrawal of Maxwell and another, were returned unopposed for Taunton.

The Great Dance of Argentina is the international name of the same company, but used outside of Argentina and Spanish speaking countries.Company and Production Homepage Both names are of the same company and same production.  History  \\"El Sonido de mi Tierra\\" was founded in 1996 with the \\"peña folklóica artística\\", organized by Luis Pereyra in \\"La Galería de Tango\\". He promoted an event in Buenos Aires, with the idea to bring together artists of both cultures of Argentina, which has been separated always: those of Argentine Folklore and those of Tango Argentino, and in this way he created a unification of one complete culture of Argentina, which represents all provinces of Argentina, which are 23, bringing them to a culture and art unification. The creator of the company is Luis Pereyra. In 2001 Nicole Nau entered the company. 2003 she becomes first dancer of the company and also gets in the general and executive production. Nicole Nau and Luis Pereyra are members of CID Unesco. 1998 the company \\"El Sonido de mi Tierra\\" performs in theatre, the Teatro Avenida, Buenos Aires and presents \\"Tango La Danza de fuego\\", a production which tells the story of \\"Orillas Maldonadas\\", written by Luis Pereyra, based on \\"El hombre de la esquina rosada\\" of Jorge Luis Borges. In 2003 the company travels to Europe, later to Japan and Central America. In 2012 appears for the first time the name \\"The Great Dance of Argentina\\". This name the company since then is using for international work, keeping the original name \\"El Sonido de mi Tierra\\" as always besides. The necessary conditions and skills for artists of this company are founded on knowledge of popular dances and music of Argentina, Tango Argentino, percussion, tap dance, vocal and playing instruments. Luis Pereyra and this company work with Tango and Folklore on a same level, as one only culture which belongs together. He follows strictly his principles to understand Tango Argentino as part of the whole Argentine Culture and Folklore. Being from Buenos Aires, the tango Argentino is the urban folklore. Roots of Folklore, Black Music, natives, migration inside the country and from abroad are showing up, in the relationship between Tango and Folklore. The instruments Luis Pereyra is using are the authentic ones of his country and those introduced by immigrants. The stage productions tells of the deepness of the culture, orientated on roots, archaic culture and symbols.

Amos Anderson grew up in the Southwestern Archipelago of Finland and studied business in Turku. He started his career in insurance, and spent two years in continental Europe studying finance and insurance. He started in press in 1905 by publishing a professional magazine for the insurance sector. His career with daily newspapers started in 1911, and in 1909 he founded a printing house together with Viktor Ek and J. O. Wasastjerna. Anderson was a Member of Parliament in 1922–1927 and a presidential elector in 1937, 1940 and 1943. The story has it that Amos Anderson had two sides to his personality: by day he was a determined businessman, and by night sensitive and sociable patron of the arts and culture. He sponsored refurbishments of churches in Turku, Pargas and Kimito, and repairs of the Swedish theatre in Helsinki. He collected 250 works of modern art, which he left in his will to a foundation he founded, Konstsamfundet. In 1913, Anderson commissioned architects W. G. Palmqvist and Einar Sjöström to design a building on Yrjönkatu. The building would function as both Anderson's private living quarters and office space for his businesses. After Anderson's death in 1961, the building was converted into Amos Anderson Art Museum which opened its doors to the public in 1965.

The parameters are Activity, Mobility, and Complexity. They are commonly used in the analysis of electroencephalography signals for feature extraction. The parameters are normalised slope descriptors (NSDs) used in EEG. Moreover, in the robotic area, the Hjorth parameters are used for tactile signal processing for the physical object properties detection such as surface textures/material detection and touch modality classification via artificial robotic skin. Parameters =Hjorth Activity= The activity parameter represents the signal power, the variance of a time function. This can indicate the surface of power spectrum in the frequency domain. This is represented by the following equation: :\\\\text{Activity} = \\\\text{var}(y(t)). Where y(t) represents the signal. =Hjorth Mobility= The mobility parameter represents the mean frequency or the proportion of standard deviation of the power spectrum. This is defined as the square root of variance of the first derivative of the signal y(t) divided by variance of the signal y(t). :\\\\text{Mobility} =\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{{\\\\text{var}(\\\\frac{dy(t)}{dt})}}{\\\\text{var}(y(t))}. =Hjorth Complexity= The Complexity parameter represents the change in frequency. The parameter compares the signal's similarity to a pure sine wave, where the value converges to 1 if the signal is more similar. :\\\\text{Complexity} =\\\\frac{{\\\\text{Mobility}(\\\\frac{dy(t)}{dt})}}{\\\\text{Mobility}(y(t))}. Tactile Signal Analysis In the earlier works, researchers employed the Fourier transform technique to interpret the obtained tactile information for texture classification. However, the Fourier transform is not appropriate for analysing non-stationary signals in which textures are irregular or non- uniform. Short time Fourier transform or Wavelet might be the most appropriate techniques to analyse non-stationary signals. However, these methods deal with a large number of data points, thereby causing difficulties at the classification step. More features require more training samples resulting in the growth of the computational complexity as well as the risk of over- fitting. To overcome these issues Kaboli et al. proposed a set of fundamental tactile descriptor inspired by Hjorth parameters. Although Hjorth parameters are defined in the time domain, they can be interpreted in the frequency domain as well. The Activity parameter is the total power of the signal. It is also the surface of the power spectrum in the frequency domain (Parseval's theorem). The Mobility parameter is determined as the square root of the ratio of the variance of the first derivative of the signal to that of the signal. This parameter is proportional to a standard deviation of the power spectrum. It is an estimate of the mean frequency. Complexity gives an estimate of the bandwidth of the signal, which indicates the similarity of the shape of the signal to a pure sine wave. Since the calculation of the Hjorth parameters is based on variance, the computational cost of this method is sufficiently low, which makes them appropriate for the real-time task.

To the left: the rubble of the home of a widow with 9 children, Israeli troops demolished her house on the 25th of January 2012. In the middle: the tinshack she now has to live in with her children in Umm al-Khair. Human rights activists and reporters have criticized the lack of amenities for the villagers while settlers nearby enjoy modern life. According to Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times Carmel is : > 'a lovely green oasis that looks like an American suburb. It has lush > gardens, kids riding bikes and air-conditioned homes. It also has a > gleaming, electrified poultry barn that it runs as a business.' Beyond its > barbed wire fencing, the Bedouins of Umm al-Kheir in shanties are denied > connection to the electricity grid, barns for their livestock and toilets, > and all attempts to build permanent dwellings are demolished. Elad Orian, an > Israeli human rights activist, noted that the chickens of Carmel's poultry > farm get more electricity and water than the Palestinian Bedouin nearby. > Nicholas Kristof, 'The Two Sides of a Barbed-Wire Fence,', The New York > Times 30 June, 2010. Hammerman writes as follows: : > Right next to the stately country homes - complete with air-conditioning, > drip-irrigation gardens and goldfish ponds - a few extended families > including old men, old women and infants live in dwellings made of tin, > cloth and plastic siding, though there are a few cinder-block structures, > too. They tread on broken, barren ground. They have no running water. They > are not connected to the power grid that lights up every settlement and > outpost in this remote region. They have no access road. David Dean Shulman has taken down the account of one of the villagers, a young man named ‘Id al-Hajalin, who after outlining their difficulties, showed two documents, a receipt for taxes he paid on his land, and another, an order from the Military Authorities to demolish his home. He commented: > “Why do they want to destroy my house? Where can I go? Can I go to America? > I have nothing, and they want to take that nothing from me. Can you help me? > Where am I supposed to go?” Umm al-Khair was one of the main subjects of the 2016 book The Way to the Spring: Life and Death in Palestine by Ben Ehrenreich.Review: 'The Way to the Spring', by Ben Ehrenreich, by Steve Weinberg, June 10, 2016, Star Tribune Umm al-Khair is also the base community for the Good Shepherd Collective, a grassroots organization resisting Israeli settler colonialism.

History The base was established in June 1966 approximately 16 km west of Kontum by the 5th Special Forces Group, Detachment A-241. In March–April 1969 the base was used as a staging base for Operation Wayne Grey an operation against the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 24th and 66th Regiments in the Plei Trap Valley. The base was transferred to the ARVN 62nd Border Rangers in August 1970. In May 1972 during the Battle of Kontum after overrunning the ARVN bases at Tân Cảnh, Đắk Tô and the Firebases along Rocket Ridge the PAVN turned their attention to the base and to Ben Het Camp which blocked the avenues for attack on Kontum. The base had been subjected to artillery fire since 24 April, but from midday on 6 May the volume of fire increased dramatically with over 500 rounds systematically destroying the base bunkers and an infantry assault by the PAVN 64th Regiment penantrated the perimeter. At 19:00 the two U.S. advisers at the base were evacuated by helicopter. The attack was repulsed and the ARVN continued to hold for a further 3 days during which time U.S. airpower, including gunships and 16 Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strikes, was concentrated on the attacking PAVN. On the night of 7 May the PAVN attempted another assault but were again repulsed suffering 300 killed. On the morning of 9 May the ARVN abandoned the base in the face of a PAVN tank and infantry assault, only 97 ARVN and their dependents reaching safety in Kontum. Current use The base has reverted to housing and farmland, the airfield is still visible on satellite images.

She is the Founder and Managing Director of Saba Consultants, which provides counsel in strategic communications planning, reputation building, and investor relations to clients in the Gulf Cooperation Council (G.C.C) countries. Previously, she was a Senior Presenter and Producer at Al Arabiya News Channel, where she conceived and launched the channel’s first business-news show, Al-Aswaq Al-Arabiya (Arabic: الاسواق العربية, meaning \\"Arab Markets\\"), in June 2005. Soon after its launch, the show became the highest-rated business program on Arab television. She anchored Al Arabiya’s main business shows five days a week for five years. Cyba Audi provides executive coaching to senior government officials and corporate managers. She is a much-solicited moderator at international forums and conferences, both locally and internationally. Audi is a feminist, who encourages Arab women to take an active role in business in the Middle East. Early life and education Cyba Audi was born in 1965 in Beirut, Lebanon. Her passion for business administration began to develop during her high school years, as she used to assist her father with running their family business. Upon obtaining her Lebanese Baccalaureate from International College, Audi pursued a Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) at the American University of Beirut, from which she graduated in 1986. Career =Private banking= Soon after receiving her B.B.A, Audi moved to London, UK, where she worked as a trust specialist and account executive at Banque Française de Londres, a small private bank. She joined Merrill Lynch in 1998 as a relationship manager. As such, she managed and rebalanced the portfolio of individuals’ investments and acted as an expert in succession planning until 2003. =Business news production = Audi's strong background in finance caught the attention of the senior management of CNBC Arabiya.

ATES is applied to provide heating and cooling to buildings. Storage and recovery of thermal energy is achieved by extraction and injection of groundwater from aquifers using groundwater wells. Systems commonly operate in a seasonal mode. The groundwater that is extracted in summer, is used for cooling by transferring heat from the building to the groundwater by means of a heat exchanger. Subsequently, the heated groundwater is injected back into the aquifer, which creates a storage of heated groundwater. In wintertime, the flow direction is reversed such that the heated groundwater is extracted and can be used for heating (often in combination with a heat pump). Therefore, operating an ATES system uses the subsurface as a temporal storage to buffer seasonal variations in heating and cooling demand. When replacing traditional fossil fuel dependent heating and cooling systems, ATES can serve as a cost-effective technology to reduce the primary energy consumption of a building and the associated CO2 emissions. In 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, many countries and regions have made targets for global climate protection. The European Union also set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase use of sustainable energy and improve energy efficiency. For this target, ATES can actually contribute significantly, as about 40% of global energy consumption is done by buildings, and is mainly for heating and cooling. Therefore, the development of ATES has been paid a lot of attention and the number of ATES has increased dramatically, especially in Europe. For example, in the Netherlands, it was estimated that about 20,000 ATES systems could be achieved by 2020. This can yield a CO2 emission reduction of about 11%, for the target of the Netherlands. Besides the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Turkey, and Sweden are also increasing the application of ATES. ATES can be applied worldwide, as long as the climatic conditions and geohydrological conditions are right. As ATES systems cumulate in urban areas optimisation of subsurface space requires attention in areas with suitable conditions.  System types  In its basic form, an ATES system consists of two wells (called a doublet). One well is used for heat storage, and the other for cold storage. During winter, (warm) groundwater is extracted from the heat storage well and injected in the cold storage well. During summer, the flow direction is reversed such that (cold) groundwater is extracted from the cold storage well and injected in the heat storage well. Because each well serves both as an extraction and injection well, these systems are called bi-directional. There are also mono-directional systems. These systems do not switch pumping direction, such that groundwater is always extracted at the natural aquifer temperature. Although thermal energy is stored in the subsurface, there is usually no intention to retrieve the stored energy. Thermal energy storage can also be achieved by circulating a fluid through a buried heat exchanger, that usually consists of a horizontal or vertical pipeline. As these systems do not extract or inject groundwater, they are called closed systems and are known as borehole thermal energy storage or ground source heat pumps. Another thermal application that uses the subsurface to provide thermal energy is geothermal energy production, which commonly uses the deeper subsurface where temperature is higher.  History  The first reported deliberate storage of thermal energy in aquifers was in China around 1960. The first ATES systems were build for industrial cooling in Shanghai. There, large amounts of groundwater were extracted to supply cooling in particular to textile factories. This led to substantial land subsidence. To inhibit the subsidence, cold surface water was injected back into the aquifer. Subsequently, it was observed that the stored water remained cold after injection and could be used for industrial cooling. Storage of thermal energy in aquifers was further suggested in the 1970s which led to field experiments and feasibility studies in France, Switzerland, US and Japan.Tsang, C.F., D. Hopkins, and G. Hellstrom, Aquifer thermal energy storage – a survey. 1980, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. There are no official statistics on the number and size of ATES systems worldwide. However, worldwide there are currently more than 2800 ATES systems in operation, abstracting more than 2.5 TWh of heating and cooling per year. The Netherlands and Sweden are considered to dominate the market in terms of implementation. 85% of all systems are located in the Netherlands, and a further 10% are found in Sweden, Denmark, and Belgium. In 2012, there were approximately 104 ATES systems in Sweden with a total capacity of 110 MW.Andersson, O., J. Ekkestubbe, and A. Ekdahl, UTES (Underground Thermal Energy Storage)—Applications and Market Development in Sweden. J. Energ. Pow. Eng, 2013. 7: p. 669 The number of ATES systems in the Netherlands in the same year was 2740, with a total estimated capacity of 1103 MW.CBS, Hernieuwbare energie in Nederland 2012 (Renewable energy in the Netherlands 2012). 2013, Centraal bureau voor de statistiek: Den Haag  Typical dimensions  Flow rates for typical applications in the utility sector are between 20 and 150 m/hour for each well. The total volume of groundwater that is stored and recovered in a year generally varies between 10 000 m and 150 000 m per well.Bakr, M., van Oostrom, N. and Sommer, W., 2013. Efficiency of and interference among multiple Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage systems; A Dutch case study. Renewable Energy, 60: 53–62. Depth at which ATES is applied varies commonly between 20 and 200 meters below surface. Temperature at these depths is generally close to the annual mean surface temperature. In moderate climates this is around 10 °C. In those regions cold storage is commonly applied between 5 and 10 °C and heat storage in the range 10 to 20 °C. Although less frequent, there are also some projects reported in which heat was stored above 80 °C.Kabus, F., Wolfgramm, M., Seibt, A., Richlak, U. and Beuster, H., 2009. Aquifer thermal energy storage in Neubrandenburg-monitoring throughout three years of regular operation”, Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Energy Storage.Sanner, B., Kabus, F., Seibt, P. and Bartels, J., 2005. Underground thermal energy storage for the German Parliament in Berlin, system concept and operational experiences, Proceedings world geothermal congress, pp. 1–8.  Hydrogeological constrains  Energy savings that can be achieved with ATES are strongly depending on the geology of a site. Mainly, ATES requires the presence of a suitable aquifer that is able to accept and yield water. Therefore, thick (>10 m) sandy aquifers are selected. Natural groundwater flow may transport (part of) the stored energy outside of the capture zone of a well during the storage phase.Sommer, W., Valstar, J., Gaans, P., Grotenhuis, T. and Rijnaarts, H., 2013. The impact of aquifer heterogeneity on the performance of aquifer thermal energy storage. Water Resources Research, 49(12): 8128–8138. To reduce advective heat loss, aquifers with a low hydraulic gradient are preferred. In addition, gradients in geochemical composition should be avoided, as mixing of water with different geochemistry can increase clogging, which will reduce the performance of a well and lead to increased maintenance costs.  Legal status  The legal status of shallow geothermal installations (<400 m) is diverse among countries.Haehnlein, S., Bayer, P. and Blum, P., 2010. International legal status of the use of shallow geothermal energy. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 14(9): 2611–2625. Regulations for installations of wells concern the use of hazardous materials and proper backfilling of the drilling hole to avoid hydraulic short circuiting between aquifers. Other legislation concerns protection of groundwater areas for drinking water supply.Bonte, M., Stuyfzand, P.J., Hulsmann, A. and Van Beelen, P., 2011. Underground thermal energy storage: environmental risks and policy developments in the Netherlands and European Union. Ecol Soc, 16(1): 22. Some countries adopt limits for minimum and maximum storage temperatures. For example, Austria (5–20 °C), Denmark (2–25 °C) and Netherlands (5–25 °C). While other countries adopt a maximum change in groundwater temperature, for example Switzerland (3 °C) and France (11 °C). Interference with chlorinated ethenes (CVOCs) ATES is currently not allowed to be applied in contaminated aquifers, due to the possible spreading of contaminants in the groundwater of the subsurface,Zuurbier, K.G., Hartog, N., Valstar, J., Post, V.E. and van Breukelen, B.M., 2013. The impact of low-temperature seasonal aquifer thermal energy storage (SATES) systems on chlorinated solvent contaminated groundwater: Modeling of spreading and degradation. Journal of contaminant hydrology, 147: 1–13. especially in urban areas. This will lead to deterioration of the quality of groundwater, which is also an important source for drinking water. Despite the regulations made to prevent the interference between ATES and groundwater contaminants, the possibility of their encounter is however rising, because of the rapid increase of the number of ATES and slow progress of remediation groundwater contaminations in urban area. Among the common groundwater contaminants, chlorinated ethenes have a most chance to interfere with the ATES system, as they are often found at the similar depth as ATES. When chlorinated ethenes present as Dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPLs), the possible dissolution of DNAPLs by ATES will cause more severe impact on the groundwater quality.Parker, J.C. and Park, E., 2004. Modeling field‐scale dense nonaqueous phase liquid dissolution kinetics in heterogeneous aquifers. Water Resources Research, 40(5). Possible application in contaminated area Illustration of relevant processes in the ATES-ENA system.The possible interference between ATES and chlorinated ethenes has been also seen as an opportunity of integration of sustainable energy technology and sustainable groundwater management. The combination of ATES and enhanced bioremediation first introduced in the “More with SubSurface Energy” (Meer met Bodemenergie, MMB) project in the Netherlands in 2009. Several scientific and practical rationales are the basics for seeing such combination as a promising possibility.Ni, Z. (2015) Bioremediation in aquifer thermal energy storage. Dissertation (in press), Wageningen University. Increased temperature around the warm well can enhance reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes. Although low temperature in cold well can hamper the biodegradation, the seasonal operation of ATES can transfer contaminant from cold well to hot well for faster biodegradation. Such seasonal groundwater transportation can also homogenize the environmental condition. ATES can be used as a biostimulation too, for example to inject electron donor or microorganism needed for reductive dechlorination. Finally, the life time of ATES (30 years) fits the long duration of in situ bioremediation. Societal impacts  The combination concept of ATES and enhanced natural attenuation (ATES-ENA) can possibly be used in the Netherlands and China, especially in urbanized areas. These areas in both countries are confronted with organic groundwater contaminations. Currently, the combination concept may be better applicable for the Netherlands with more mature technology and application of ATES. And the overlapping between ATES and groundwater contamination also promotes the need of this combined technology. However, for China where ATES is much less developed compared to the Netherlands, the important advantages are that many more demonstration pilot projects can be set-up prior to real applications, and flexible systems can be developed because of the less intense pressure on subsurface use by ATES compared to the Netherlands. For sustainable urban development, the combined ATES-ENA technology can provide contributions to the solution of both energy and environmental problems.

The organization works with a wide range of individuals with disabilities: mental retardation, developmental delays, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders, the Autism spectrum, special needs with recognized handicaps (children with minor to severe retardation, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome), and more. Founded by Kalman Samuels in 1990, the organization offers a range of programs to approximately 2000 individuals with disabilities including infants, children, and youth and their families. Non-denominational and free of charge, Shalva offers a range of therapies, inclusive educational frameworks, recreational programs, vocational training, respite and family support. Shalva advocates for the inclusion of persons with disabilities through employment programs, community initiatives, and disability research. Shalva collaborates with communities worldwide as well as government, academic, and cultural institutions to pioneer innovative therapy solutions around the common goal of improving the lives of people with disabilities and promoting their inclusion in society. The organization is supported by a wide network of volunteers from the broader community as well as National Service volunteers. Shalva's programs have been distinguished by several awards, among them: the President of Israel Prize for Excellence (1994); the Mayor of Jerusalem Award for Exceptional Service (1999); the Shalem Fund Award for “Israel’s most unique program for the mentally challenged” (2004); the Knesset Speaker’s Quality of Life Prize for Leadership and Public Excellence (2005); the Ruderman Foundation Prize for the integration of children with special needs (2012); and Consultant Status for the United Nations Economic and Social Council (2018). The organization’s management standards are recognized by the ISO 9001/2001 certification and Midot’s Seal for Outstanding Eﬀectiveness. The story of Shalva's establishment is chronicled in a memoir by the organization's founder, Kalman Samules, published by Toby Press in May 2020 called Dreams Never Dreamed. Background As parents of a child with disabilities, Kalman and Malki Samuels understood the need for the founding of an organization that would ease the burdens of families of children with disabilities. Their son, Yossi Samuels, was born a healthy child in 1977 however, after receiving a faulty DPT vaccination, he was rendered blind, deaf, and hyperactive. He was isolated in his own world without a method of communication. Based on their personal experience with the day-to-day challenges of raising a family and the constant need to care for a child with special needs, they decided to establish Shalva in 1990. The first center was established in a private apartment in the Har Nof neighborhood in Jerusalem and catered to a few dozen local children. As a greater need emerged, the organization bought an additional facility on an adjacent street and began expanding its programs; the building was later called ”Beit Nachshon” in memory of Nachshon Wachsman who was kidnapped and murdered by terrorists in 1994. Over the years, programs with innovative therapies were developed for infants, and the organization began to support research in various subjects in its field. Today, Shalva's programs are housed in the Shalva National Center in the Bayit Vegan near the Shaare Zedek Medical Center. The Shalva National Center thumb Construction of the Shalva National Center began in 2008, neighboring the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. The 220,000 sq.ft center opened its doors on September 2016 and has disability accessible facilities such as an auditorium, sports center, therapeutic and recreational swimming pools, fitness rooms, inclusive playgrounds and more. Shalva National Center served as the inspiration for Jill's House, a Christian non-profit organization located in Northern Virginia.

Description Homoranthus homoranthoides is a distinctive species recognised by its low growing prostrate habit. A shrub with greyish green linear leaves, small pendulous cream coloured flowers which turn red as they age. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1853 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Schuermannia homoranthoides and published the description in the journal Linnaea. In 1991, Lyndley Craven and S.R.Jones changed the name to Homoranthus homoranthoides. The specific epithet (homoranthoides) refers to the similarity of this species (when named as Schuermannia homoranthoides) to those in the genus Homoranthus. The ending -oides is a Latin suffix meaning \\"like\\", \\"resembling\\" or \\"having the form of\\". Distribution and habitat Homoranthus homoranthoides grows in heath and woodland on the southern part of the Eyre Peninsula. Grows on a variety of substrates in mallee heath and woodland.

In 1997 H-Net won the American Historical Association's James Harvey Robinson Prize, awarded for innovative methods of history teaching. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, under Jensen's leadership—and with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities—H-Net \\"rapidly became a forum attracting both historians with established expertise in computer-based quantitative research and younger colleagues interested in exploring the analytical possibilities of hypertext,\\" and \\"greatly assisted the development of the technical expertise and intellectual ambitions of historians who undertook a remarkable number of Web-based projects through the second half of the 1990s.\\"Paul Turnbull, \\"Historians, Computing and the World-Wide-Web,\\" Australian Historical Studies Vol. 41, Iss. 2, 2010.

Before submitting her article for publication, Fried consulted with the historian Kerby A. Miller, who had long disagreed with Jensen's thesis. Miller found her argument to be a worthy, scholarly rebuttal in need of little editing. Fried's paper provided examples of \\"No Irish Need Apply\\" in newspaper archives, contesting Jensen's thesis that there was no evidence of same. Jensen wrote a rebuttal to her argument. He said, \\"All Fried's cases melt away under classroom scrutiny. The lesson is teachers need to insist that students review the scholarly literature before they believe everything that flashes on their screens.\\" He protested blog postings that he said had recycled the so-called \\"NINA myth\\", speculated about political motivations, and suggested \\"that highly paid university professors are practically worthless because they can easily be outwitted by an eighth grader in terms of doing scholarly research.\\"Jensen, Richard, \\"No Irish Need Apply?\\" HistoryNewsNetwork.org (11 August 2015) Retrieved 22 Aug. 2015.

The tractor can tow an aircraft from the terminal gate to the take-off point (taxi-out phase) and return it to the gate after landing (taxi-in phase). The TaxiBot eliminates the use of airplane engines during taxi-in and until immediately prior to take-off during taxi-out, significantly reducing aircraft fuel usage and the risk of foreign object damage. The TaxiBot is controlled by the pilot from the cockpit using the regular pilot controls and has an 800-hp hybrid-electric engine. The TaxiBot has two models. The Narrow-Body (NB) TaxiBot will be used by existing and future single-aisle aircraft such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 while the Wide-Body (WB) TaxiBot aim for all existing and future twin-aisle aircraft such as Airbus A380 and Boeing 747. History The TaxiBot completed certification tests on July 2014, was approved for airport towing in November 2014. and had the first commercial flight dispatch-towed, Lufthansa LH140 from Frankfurt to Nuremberg, on November 25, 2014. In February 2015, the TaxiBot entered regular flight operations by Lufthansa at Frankfurt Airport. Certification tests of the wide-body model are expected to start in autumn of 2015 with aim for certification in early 2016. In October 2019, Air India became the first airline to \\"regularly\\" use the TaxiBot by deploying the unit to despatch a Delhi-Mumbai flight from Terminal 3 of Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi, one of the Top 10 airports in the world by annual passenger traffic. Marketplace The TaxiBot is the only certified and operational alternative taxiing system currently in the market. Competing products in development by WheelTug and EGTS International are different as they are installed directly on the aircraft landing gear. This allows for shorter turnaround time but adds weight to the aircraft. The EGTS partnership has been dissolved due to the new economics imposed by the sharp drop in the price of jet fuel.

Biography Fergusson, who sometimes signed her work as Chris J Fergusson, was born in Dumfries, one of five children of James Stark, a solicitor, and his wife Agnes Waugh Drape. She attended school at the Dumfries Academy before travelling in Europe where she visited France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. When she returned to Britain, Fergusson studied at the Crystal Palace School of Art in London. From about 1900 to 1906 Fergusson attended the Glasgow School of Art, first as a student and then as a tutor. She was awarded one of the first Diplomas awarded at the School of Art. She also taught for a year between 1905 and 1906 on secondment at Kirkcudbright Academy and then as Principal Teacher of Art at the Glasgow High School for Girls. Later, sho would also teach at the Benedictine Convent School in Dumfries. As well as painting, Fergusson produced metalwork and tapestry pieces and came to be regarded as one of the group, later, known as the Glasgow Girls. She was also active in the Suffragette movement. Whilst studying at Glasgow she became engaged to David Fergusson, a young solicitor, whom she married in 1908. The couple settled in Maxwelltown where they began to raise a family. The family home was decorated in art nouveau style by Fergusson. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s Fergusson travelled widely in Scotland and painted several views of the Isle of Arran, the East Neuk of Fife and of St. Abbs in Berwickshire which are considered among her best works. In 1922, a year after the birth of her third child, Fergusson was among the co-founders, along with Jessie M. King, E.A. Taylor and E.A. Hornel of the Dumfries and Galloway Fine Art Society, which in its early years, exhibited work by many distinguished Scottish artists. In 1928 Fergusson was elected to the Society of Scottish Artists. Fergusson won the Lauder Award from the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists three times, in 1933, 1938 and in 1954. An exhibition of some 116 paintings by Fergusson was held in Dumfries in 1952 and a retrospective exhibition of her work was held in the same town in 1957. Two works by Fergusson, Salutation Inn, Dumfries and The Brig-end of Dumfries hang in the Dumfries Council Chamber Room.

He is best known for being the founder and artistic director of the Hofesh Shechter Company. Shechter was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Choreography in 2016 for his work on Bartlett Sher's revival of Fiddler on the Roof. Since 2016, he has been named as one of The Stage's 100 most influential people in theatre. Early life Hofesh Shechter was born in Jerusalem, Israel, in 1975. At 6, Shechter began to study piano, later developing an interest in folk dance aged 12. At 15, he successfully auditioned for the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance as a pianist, but switched to dance upon his arrival, taking formal classes in ballet and modern dance. Whilst still training as a dancer, Shechter was conscripted into the Israel Defence Forces on his eighteenth birthday. He later described this experience as \\"like an electrical short circuit in my brain\\". Midway through the compulsory three years of his training, he moved to Tel Aviv when he was accepted as a junior into the Batsheva Dance Company. To complete his army duty, Shechter was given an evening clerical job, and would train with Batsheva by day. Career During his time with Batsheva, Shechter graduated to the main company, where he danced in works by Ohad Naharin and Wim Vandekeybus, amongst others, whilst also studying percussion. After three years, Shechter left the company in order to play drums in a rock group, The Human Beings, and study music in Paris. In 2002, he moved to London to perform with the Jasmin Vardimon Company, creating Fragments in 2003 on an interim with the company. Shechter also composed the music for the production. Shechter was then commissioned by The Place Prize in 2004 to create Cult, winning the Audience Choice Award. Further works include Uprising in 2006, In Your Rooms, which he expanded in 2007 to work for the three venues The Place, the Southbank Centre and Sadler's Wells, and The Art of Not Looking Back in 2009, for an all-female cast. In 2008 he choreographed the dance sequence that opened the second series of Skins. He formed the Hofesh Shechter Dance Company in 2008.

Early life Kantor grew up in Athens, Georgia, where he began taking piano lessons at age \\"four or five,\\" and developed an early interest in baseball through following the Atlanta Braves. He moved to the Chicago area when he was thirteen, and soon discovered Nancy Faust, the renowned organist for the Chicago White Sox. Kantor has repeatedly cited Faust as a major influence in his musical development as an organist. Kantor continued to play music through high school and college. He attended Brandeis University, where he honed his improvisation skills playing piano with a campus sketch comedy group. After college, he remained in the Boston area and began to focus seriously on playing the organ, performing with local bands and comedy groups while supporting himself by working in libraries at Boston University and Harvard Law School. Boston Red Sox When the Red Sox were looking for a new organist in 2003, Kantor was able to get an audition through the help of a friend who was working for the team. After two auditions in which he was asked to play a variety of popular songs and asked to improvise based on specific situations within a baseball game, he was hired. As of 2015, Kantor had not missed a single home game in twelve years. During Red Sox home games at Fenway Park, Kantor plays organ music before and after games, mixing traditional favorites with current popular songs. During the ballgame, organ and recorded music alternate. Kantor works closely with TJ Connelly, the DJ for the Red Sox. Kantor takes requests from fans via his Twitter account (@jtkantor) and often plays songs suggested during the game by fans at the ballpark. Sometimes he learns those songs in advance so he can play them for the requestee, a process Steve Albini called \\"incredibly charming.\\" Kantor has said that he got his idea in part from Yo La Tengo's live request fundraising shows on WFMU. Bands and other performances In addition to his work with the Red Sox, Kantor plays regularly with Jim's Big Ego, a Boston-based rock band; The Split Squad, a so-called \\"super group\\" featuring former members of Blondie and The Fleshtones; and The Baseball Project, which writes and plays songs about baseball. Kantor's high-profile job with the Red Sox has led to other notable performances including a program of ballpark music at Boston's Symphony Hall after the Red Sox's 2004 World Series championship; appearances on ESPN's SportsCenter, where he has played background music on the opening day of the baseball season for several years; and at the Todos Santos Music Festival, a multi-day arts and music festival founded by REM guitarist Peter Buck, at which Kantor plays keyboards and accordion in support of a variety of bands. He was the organist for the Dropkick Murphys \\"Streaming Outta Fenway\\" show on May 30, 2020. 7th-Inning Stretch On March 26, 2020, with the baseball season cancelled, Kantor began livestreaming a daily show called the 7th-Inning Stretch on Facebook Live. He plays requested songs, shares baseball trivia, and participates in Q&A; with viewers. The show, which is produced by his wife the Rev. Mary Jane Eaton (and Chloe Jr. a very small hippo), always includes the 7th Inning Stretch, a sing- a-long version of \\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\" with one changed lyric: \\"I DO care if I ever get back.\\" Kantor and Eaton encourage their viewers, who come from all around the world, to make donations to their local food banks in addition to being good to each other and washing their hands. The show has had a number of \\"surprise special guests\\" including Peter Gammons, Joe Castiglione, Mike Mills, Kelly Hogan, Tanya Donelly, Ted Allen, Gary Louris and John Jackson, Ira Kaplan, Haben Girma, Ben Gibbard, Dave Davis, Steve Gorman, Kathy Valentine, Nate Query and Jenny Conlee, and Nancy Faust.

He headed the Genna crime family with his brothers. Genna was ambushed by a Genna family turncoat on orders of North Side Gang leaders Vince Drucci and Bugs Moran.  Early life  Antonio Genna was born on July 12, 1890,http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=genna&GSbyrel;=all&GSdyrel;=all&GSob;=n&GRid;=3394& to Sicilian parents, Antonio Genna Sr. and Maria Concetta Utica in Marsala, Sicily. He had six brothers: Michele \\"the Devil\\", Vincenzo \\"Jim\\", Pietro \\"Peter\\", Salvatore \\"Sam\\", Angelo \\"Bloody Angelo\\", and Nicola Genna; and two sisters: Rosa Laudicina and Caterina Mariana. He and his brothers entered the U.S. through New York around 1910.  Legitimate business  Before becoming a gangster, Genna was an excellent building contractor and architect. If he stuck to this profession, he could have amounted to something honorable, but the lure of fast cash and cars and power quickly won over his mind as a way of life.  Prohibition and O'Banion  Genna reportedly had some rudimentary skill as a surgeon, and was known to operate on his soldiers if they couldn't go to a hospital for fear of arrest. They started selling their extra alcohol at cut-rate prices outside of their territory on the North Side. This caused a problem with the North Side Gang leader Charles Dean O'Banion, who in turn, went to South Side Gang boss John \\"Johnny the Fox\\" Torrio and Unione Siciliana boss Mike Merlo to get the Gennas to back down. Torrio refused, so O'Banion started hijacking alcohol shipments belonging to the Genna brothers. Torrio ordered the brothers to kill O'Banion; the brothers carried out the hit on November 10, 1924.\\"La Cosa Nostra database: Genna Brothers\\" Brothers Francesco Ioele and two Genna hitmen—Giovanni Scalise and Alberto Anselmi—entered O'Banion's flower shop, Schofield, and when Yale shook O'Banion's hand, Scalise and Anselmi shot two bullets into his chest and two in his neck. And while O'Banion was lying face-down on the floor, one of the men shot a final bullet in the back of his head.The Dean O'Banion Project  Personal life  Genna had a girlfriend named Gladys Bagwill, whom the rest of the Gennas did not like due to her not being Italian. She was a minister's daughter. Apparently, Genna had planned to marry her (before he was killed).  Gang war and death  After the O'Banion murder, Chicago erupted into a full-scale war. The North Siders—now led by Earl \\"Hymie\\" Weiss—attempted to kill Torrio outside his home, causing him to flee to Italy, leaving his second-in- command—Alphonse \\"Scarface\\" Capone—as head of the Outfit. Then, the North Siders took aim at the Gennas. On May 26, 1925, Weiss, Vincent \\"the Schemer\\" Drucci and George \\"Bugs\\" Moran wounded Tony's brother Angelo in a high-speed chase, causing him to die shortly after. Then on June 13, 1925, Mike Genna was killed by police after a shootout with North Siders. On July 8, 1925, Tony Genna was asked to meet by one of his friends—Antonio \\"Cavalero\\" Spano (aka Giuseppe Nerone)—at Grand Avenue and Curtis Street. He agreed, not knowing that the meeting was set up by Drucci and Moran. The two men met in front of a grocery store, and when they shook hands, another two men stepped out from behind Spano and shot Genna in the chest and abdomen (Spano set it up to be just like O'Banion's murder). Tony was rushed to the hospital and lived long enough to tell Sam Genna that it was Spano who lured him.  Funeral  Genna's funeral was the exact opposite of his brother Genna's funeral. It was modest and secretive. There were only two floral pieces, one from a relative and one from his remaining brothers. His casket cost $5,000. None of his brothers showed up at the funeral. Due to Tony being a slain gangster, Cardinal Mundelin refused the family Catholic funeral rites.  Aftermath  The remaining three brothers fled Chicago. On August 26, 1926, Spano was killed by one of Giuseppe \\"Joe\\" Aiello's brothers for a past transgression against the Aiellos. After the Gennas fled, the Aiello brothers declared themselves the bosses of the old Genna territory.The true and complete story of 'machine gun' Jack McGurn by Amanda Jayne Parr pg. 244 The Aiellos had an alliance with Castellammarese Clan boss Salvatore Maranzano and a close connection to the North Siders. They attempted to murder Capone to become the most powerful Italian organization in Chicago. In 1930, Joe Aiello was murdered and Capone took over the territory.

He headed the Genna crime family with his brothers. Genna and his brothers waged war against the North Side Gang before half of the brothers were killed and Genna fled.  Early life  Vincenzo Genna was born on in Marsala, Sicily. His parents, Antonio Genna Sr. and Maria had six other sons: Antonio \\"the Gentleman\\", Angelo \\"Bloody Angelo\\", Mike \\"the Devil\\", Salvatore \\"Sam\\", Pietro \\"Peter\\", and Nicola Genna (who stayed in Sicily); and two sisters: Rosa Laudicina and Caterina Mariana. He and his brothers entered the U.S. through New York around 1910.  Prohibition and O'Banion  The Genna brothers became a close knit Marsala-based Mafia and bootlegging gang. When Prohibition became a federal law in 1919, the Gennas obtained a federal license to legally manufacture industrial alcohol, in which they sold illegally.\\"La Cosa Nostra database: Genna Brothers\\" Brothers Tony and his brothers operated from Chicago's Little Italy, which was located west of the Chicago loop. During prohibition, Genna owned an illegal bar near Taylor and Halstead. They started selling their extra alcohol at cut-rate prices outside of their territory on the North Side. This caused a problem with the North Side Gang leader Charles Dean O'Banion, who in turn, went to South Side Gang boss Giovanni \\"Johnny the Fox\\" Torrio and Unione Siciliana boss Mike Merlo to get the Gennas to back down. Torrio refused, so O'Banion started hijacking alcohol shipments belonging to the Genna brothers. On November 3, 1924, Dean O'Banion inadvertently signed his own death warrant during an argumentative phone call to arch-rival Angelo Genna. Their disagreement originated at The Ship, the gambling casino that the North Side gang boss owned along with the Torrio Syndicate. On this day, O'Banion sat in with Al Capone, Frank Nitti, Frank Rio, and others to tally the week's profits. It was mentioned that Angelo Genna had dropped a large amount of cash, plus a sizable marker. Capone recommended that they cancel the marker as a professional courtesy. O'Banion, instead, got Genna on the telephone and demanded that he pay his debt within a week. With this personal insult, Angelo Genna and his family could no longer be restrained.Schoenberg, Robert J. Mr. Capone. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1992. , pg. 116 Until then, Merlo and the Unione had refused to sanction a hit on O'Banion. However, Merlo had terminal cancer and died on November 8, 1924. With Merlo gone, the Gennas and South Siders were free to move on O'Banion. Torrio ordered the brothers to kill O'Banion; the brothers carried out the hit on November 10, 1924. Francesco Ioele and two Genna hitmen—Giovanni Scalise and Alberto Anselmi—entered O'Banion's flower shop, Schofield, and when Yale shook O'Banion's hand, Scalise and Anselmi shot two bullets into his chest and two in his neck. And while O'Banion was lying face- down on the floor, one of the men shot a final bullet in the back of his head.  Gang war  After the O'Banion murder, Chicago erupted into a full-scale war. The North Siders—now led by Adelard Cunin—attempted to kill Torrio outside his home, causing him to flee to Italy, leaving his second-in- command—Alphonse \\"Scarface\\" Capone—as head of the Outfit. Then, the North Siders took aim at the Gennas. On May 26, 1925, Moran, Vincent \\"the Schemer\\" Drucci, and Earl \\"Hymie\\" Weiss wounded Tony's brother Angelo in a high-speed chase, causing him to die shortly after. Then on June 13, 1925, Mike Genna is killed by police after a shootout with North Siders. On July 8, 1925, Tony Genna was ambushed and killed by a Genna turncoat. James and his remaining two brothers fled Chicago.  Return to Italy  After three of his brothers’ deaths, Genna fled to Italy via Paris with Torrio. After arriving in Italy, Genna had spent much of his money he made from the family’s alcohol business at night clubs and from living in Via Monte Grappa. He made a plan to steal the Madonna Di Trapani church jewels in Sicily. In the first week of January 1926, Genna was arrested in Rome, Italy, for the theft of the Madonna Di Trapani church jewels. He was sentenced to a couple of years of hard labor in the jail at Favignana, and was released between 1928 and 1929.  Return to Chicago  Genna then decided to return to Chicago and get back into business as a gangster. On May 31, 1930, Genna was driving in a car with four old Genna gang members, when a large sedan pulled up alongside of them and a volley of shotgun and pistol shots into the car. Philip Gnolfo was killed and two others were wounded. Genna gave up on muscling in on the old Genna territory and fled to Calumet City.  Death and aftermath  On November 8, 1931, Vincenzo Genna died of heart disease. His remaining two Chicago brothers also died of natural causes: Pietro died on May 13, 1948, at Columbus Hospital; and on December 20, 1951, Salvatore Genna died of a heart attack in his home on 865 Blue Island Ave. See also * Italians in Chicago References Category:Bootleggers Category:1888 births Category:1931 deaths ","title":"Vincenzo Genna"},{"id":"45229030","text":"The Rivers State Ministry of Transport is the government ministry responsible for matters concerning transportation issues and policy in Rivers State, Nigeria.

From 1961 until 1963 he worked as executive vice president of Loews Hotels, and was responsible for the planning and building of six new New York hotels. Philippe is best remembered for founding the April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf Astoria in 1951, which he ran with Elsa Maxwell until his sacking from the hotel in 1959. The balls were major events in the US socialite calendar, and raised millions of dollars for American and French charities over the 28 years of its existence. His Lucullus Circle dinners also attracted some of the wealthiest businessmen of the day to feast on six to eight course meals. During his career at the Waldorf Astoria it has been estimated that Philippe was responsible for his clients spending $150 million alone on banquets, which led him to be referred to as \\"one of the truly great men this industry has ever produced\\" by George Lang. The suave Philippe led a colorful life, with many lovers including Grace Kelly and Barbara Walters, and three wives. He was investigated for tax evasion in 1958 and admitted guilt one count, for which he was fined the maximum $10,000. He had numerous other business interests and investments, and was responsible for building at least three restaurants, a casino, a theater, and an eighteen-hole golf course in Guadeloupe in the 1960s. Career =Background= The Waldorf Astoria New York Hotel Philippe was born in London in 1910, the son of a chef, and was trained at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris. By age 20, he had settled in the United States and was an assistant to the Waldorf's Oscar Tschirky. Upon Oscar's retirement in 1943, Philippe stepped into this position as Maître d'hôtel. He went on to become \\"one of New York's cuisine kingpins\\". In July 1948, Philippe hired Alexis Lichine to buy wines in Europe for the Waldorf Astoria; the two men would become close friends and business partners. =Social events= Marilyn Monroe with organizer Elsa Maxwell at the 1957 April in Paris Ball In 1951 Philippe founded the April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf. It was initially held annually in April 1952, but according to Ann Vaccaro, former executive director of the ball, it was changed to October because \\"Mr. Philippe decided that because there are so many balls in the spring he would make it in October\\". After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season; the balls were major events in the socialite calendar, and raised millions of dollars for American and French charities over the 28 years of its existence. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues. The ball was designed to cater for \\"very, very high-class people\\" according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes and even cars. It attracted many of the most famous people of the day, including Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich. By the mid 1970s his balls were charging $185 per person; the 1974 ball netted roughly $175,000. During his career at the Waldorf Astoria it has been estimated that Philippe was responsible for his clients spending $150 million alone on banquets. Philippe was also noted for his Lucullus Circle dinners and women-only luncheons, which were both very popular. The Lucullus Circle dinners, inaugurated in 1951, brought about a \\"new golden age of gastronomy\\", attracting some of the wealthiest businessmen in the world at the time to feast on some \\"six to eight food courses and two wines with each course\\". Philippe \\"enjoyed acting like a cross between a benevolent dictator and a kindly father\\" at the dinners according to George Lang. The ninth dinner featured a menu of \\"heroic proportions\\", high and wide, with over eight pages. On May 10, 1965 Claude Philippe threw a party for Chevalier off his usual site, this time in the Oscar's Delmonico wine caves. By 1972, however the dinners had begun to lose their appeal. New York Magazine noted that the dinners were still appreciated for their \\"enormous stocks of wine\\" but that it no longer seemed to \\"have the appeal of the other groups\\". They nonetheless continued. After Philippe's death, his wife, Helga, took over planning the gentlemen's dinners, as well as coordinating the wines and greeting the attendees; she was the only woman present at these events. In 2013, entertainer Harry Belafonte recalled being signed to perform at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1959 by Philippe. When it was discovered that Belafonte was an African-American, Philippe was relieved from his post of long-standing and the hotel tried, but failed, to cancel Belafonte's performances. =Later work and interests= After being sacked from the Waldorf Astoria in 1959, Philippe was appointed executive vice president of the Zeckendorf Hotels Corporation for two years, which at the time owned the Commodore (Grand Hyatt), the Manhattan and Drake hotels.(by subscription) From 1961 until 1963 he worked as executive vice president of Loews Hotels, and was responsible for the planning and building of six new New York hotels.(by subscription) After 1963 he presided his own consulting firm, taking responsibility of the April Paris Ball until his death in 1978. Philippe was the head of a group of investors who bought the noted Le Pavillon in 1967. The restaurant came on the market after the sudden death of its previous owner, Henri Soulé, in 1966.(By subscription) However, Philippe and his investment group did not own the restaurant very long; it was forced to close in October 1972 due to a lack of patronage. He was taken gravely ill three days before the 1978 ball in October and died by Christmas of that year. The La Belle Creole resort in 2007 Philippe had numerous business interests and investments, and was responsible for building at least three restaurants, a casino, a theater, and an eighteen- hole golf course in Guadeloupe in the 1960s. By 1960, Alexis Lichine and Philippe owned an extensive stretch of beach called Jack Bay. They bought a large parcel of undeveloped land in the French portion of Saint Martin around 1964, Philippe's dream had been to build a luxury resort called La Belle Creole which would be like a tiny portion of France in the Caribbean. Philippe's intended guests were the people he had been acquainted with through his hotel work. His plans were also for a casino, a nightclub and various luxury shops as part of the resort. The French government was interested enough in the project to assist Philippe by providing a desalination plant and a paved road leading to the potential resort. Philippe hired architects and designers who estimated that it would cost about $5.5 million to make the dream a reality. It was decided to break ground after an investment of $2.5 million, which was enough to construct buildings and begin the resort plans. However, Philippe's funds ran out by 1969 and work on La Belle Creole was suspended. Philippe was able to get an emergency loan of $250,000 from a Lebanese company, but this did not go very far to completing the work on the project. He got some help in redrawing his budget and a larger loan of $500,000 from a large Paris bank through J. Jay Frankel, a financier on Wall Street. Philippe's investors believed that the re-budgeting and additional loan would complete at least half of the resort and allow it to open for business, but Philippe continued to make expensive changes in the project such as adding more windows to all of the suites. When it was evident that the project was once again in financial trouble, one of the investors in the property offered Philippe a loan for an additional $750,000, provided that the project would now result in a more modest resort. Philippe was highly insulted and told the investor offering the additional funding, \\"I have created a Cadillac. You want to put into it a Chevrolet engine.\\" By the summer of 1970, funds to continue building were exhausted; work stopped on La Belle Creole and Philippe was forced to abandon his project. The resort eventually went into the receivership of the French government, who eagerly sought a buyer. Potential new investors were interested in the property, Club Med and Marriott among them, but lost their interest upon learning of the financial tangle. Aristotle Onassis also thought about La Belle Creole, but changed his mind after his representative had inspected the property. The resort began to slip into deterioration and theft was very common-resort furniture could be easily found in many local homes. Two men set up shop at the resort with the claim that they were liquidating the property's assets for its creditors, but they had no connection to the investors or the resort. Philippe refused to admit failure with La Belle Creole and until his death in 1978, continued to tell friends that his glorious resort would open soon. It was not until 1989 that the resort was completed and opened for guests for the first time. The casino and nightclub never materialized and the size of the property was reduced to 25 acres. A 1995 hurricane forced the closing of La Belle Creole and the resort has remained closed since that time. Personal life and reception Philippe was described as being tall, dark and lanky of frame, with an aquiline nose, long bony fingers and an acid tongue. He was cited as being of a \\"suave\\" and \\"polished\\" demeanor, and Life magazine remarked that he was \\"suave enough to charm the most difficult hostess\\". He was a \\"strange, extremely creative, intelligent, but a somewhat warped individual\\"; yet one, according to George Lang, who was \\"an amazingly generous person\\" who would frequently invite guests to his country estate at Watch Hill Farm. Victor Borge referred to Philippe as a \\"one-man atom\\". A workaholic, and a sometimes controversial figure, in 1958 he was indicted on four counts of tax evasion, with the Federal prosecutor believing him to have collected $300,000 in gratuities in 1952-55 alone. He pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment, and was fined a maximum $10,000.(by subscription) Philippe was a womanizer and was extremely popular with women; when visiting the hotel, \\"nearly every society lady in New York of the 1950s insisted that she either knew or was served personally by the great Claudius Charles Philippe\\". He was married three times, first to food writer Poppy Cannon from 1941 to 1949, with whom he had a daughter, Claudia; Cannon went on to marry Walter White. His second wife from 1952 to about 1961 was Comédie-Française actress Mony Dalmès, who incidentally doubled for Marilyn Monroe in a number of films, and his third and last wife was Helga in the 1970s. He was romantically involved with numerous women, including Grace Kelly before her marriage and Barbara Walters. In 1977, Philippe was said to be writing his memoirs; it is not known if he intended them to be published. George Lang of the Waldorf believed that the hotel tried to cover up his misdemeanors, noting that he had a \\"kind of arrogance, an unnecessary arrogance very often, which was counterproductive\\". However, he referred to Philippe as \\"one of the truly great men this industry has ever produced\\". Alphonse Salamone similarly remarked that \\"Claude Philippe brought an ingredient to this industry that I don't think has been surpassed\\". Jorge Hansen of Hilton Hotels stated that Philippe was \\"probably the outstanding creative sales catering director of any hotel. He knew also when sat on the client side how to get the very best for the client\\".

Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 22:267-281. is a term that was created in the early 80's to describe the fact that verb phrases are memorized better if a learner performs the described action during learning, compared to just getting the verbal information or seeing someone else perform the action.Engelkamp, Johannes & Krumnacker, Horst (1980). „Imaginale und motorische Prozesse beim Behalten verbalen Materials\\". Zeitschrift für experimentelle und angewandte Psychologie 27: 511-533. The use of gestures improves the quantity of phrases that can be recalled, the phrases can be recalled for a longer amount of time, and they can be accessed easier. Knowing that enacting improves memory performance can be useful in education and treatment of patients with memory disorders.Macedonia, Manuela & von Kriegstein, Katharina (2012) . „Gestures Enhance Foreign Language Learning”. Biolinguistics 6(3-4): 393-416. Studies showing the enactment effect In their study, Engelkamp and Krumnacker (1980) gave participants verbal phrases like “brush the teeth” or \\"shuffle the cards\\". In a recognition task and a free recall task, the memory of participants was tested under four learning conditions: one group performed the action, a second group was supposed to imagine the action, the third group watched someone perform the action, and the last group just heard the phrases. The group that had enacted the gestures performed best in both tasks. Around the same time, Cohen examined recall capacity of verbal phrases in participants under three conditions: one group performed the action on a concrete object, a second group saw the experimenter perform the action on an object, and a third group only got verbal instructions. The self-performed task led to the best results, supporting the claim that the enactment effect exists. Since then, the effect has been reduplicated in many studies. Recall after enactment tasks was shown to be superior to recall after verbal tasks in children as well as in adults.Saltz, Eli & Sizanne Donnenwerth-Nolan (1981) \\"Does Motoric Imagery Facilitate Memory for Sentences? A Selective Interference Test\\". JOURNAL OF VERBAL LEARNING AND VERBAL BEHAVIOR 20:322-332. Furthermore, the enactment effect is existent in elderly people and people with moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type.Hutton, S., Sheppard, L., Rusted, J.M., & H.H., Ratner(1996) \\"Structuring and Retrieval Environment to Facilitate Learning in Individuals with Dementia of the Alzheimer Type\\". MEMORY 4(2):113-130. Enactment effect in second language acquisition Gestures have been shown to be a useful tool in teaching a foreign language. The enactment effect can be used in second language teaching in order to learn a language more efficiently, faster, and to prevent forgetting. Various studies have shown that the use of gestures while learning new words improves recall and retention. The enactment effect in second language learning could be shown in children as well as adults.Tellier, M. (2008) \\"The effect of gestures on second language memorization by young children\\". Gesture 8(2):219-235Macedonia, Manuela & Thomas R. Knösche (2011) \\"Body in Mind: How Gestures Empower Foreign Language Learning\\". Mind, Brain, and Education 5:4, 196-211.Quinn-Allen, Linda (1995) \\"The effects of emblematic gestures on the development and access of mental representations of French expressions\\". The Modern Language Journal 79:521-529. Not only does enactment improve memorization, but also the use of words in speech production. Using gestures while learning is helpful in learning concrete words as well as abstract words such as “change” or “difference”. Studies supported this claim in showing that abstract words were better remembered when a gesture was used while encoding. Neurolinguistical research on the enactment effect In more recent studies, researchers have been trying to find the neurological explanation of the enactment effect, and the reason why memory is enhanced after enactment. It was shown that not mere physical motor information leads to the enactment effect, but that the semantic content of the gesture plays a role as well.Masumoto, K., Yamaguchi, M., Sutani, K., Tsuneto, S., Fujita, A., & M., Tonoike(2006) \\"Reactivation of physical motor information in the memory of action events\\". Brain Research 1101:102-109. Iconic gestures enhance memory compared to meaningless gestures which have no positive effect on memorization. Event-related potentials showed that enactment leads to deeper processing of new information, eliciting the assumption that by using gestures, the meaning of the new word is connected with an already existing concept in one’s native language.Kelly, Spencer D., Tara McDevitt, & Megan Esch (2009) \\"Brief training with co-speech gesture lends a hand to word learning in a foreign language\\".

A relatively young star, its age is estimated to be 16 million years, and its mass is about 90% that of the Sun. The star has an apparent magnitude of 12.3 and requires a telescope to be seen. The star's name comes from the SuperWASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) program and the star's coordinates. The star is variable due to the planet orbiting around it and has been given the variable star designation V1400 Centauri. In 2007, J1407 was observed to be eclipsed and orbited by at least one major body, 1SWASP J1407b (J1407b), thought to be either a large gas giant planet or a brown dwarf with an immense ring system. Subsequent observations have not successfully detected J1407b, suggesting that it is on a highly eccentric orbit around the star. 1SWASP J140747.93−394542.6 b The discovery of the J1407 system and its unusual eclipses were first reported by a team led by University of Rochester astronomer Eric Mamajek in 2012. The existence and parameters of the ring system around the substellar companion J1407b were deduced from the observation of a very long and complex eclipse of the parent star lasting 56 days during April and May 2007. The low-mass companion J1407b has been referred to as a \\"Saturn on steroids\\" or “Super Saturn”Gigantic ring system around J1407b much larger, heavier than Saturn’s, on University of Rochester website. due to its massive system of circumplanetary rings with a radius of approximately 90 million km (0.6 AU). The orbital period of J1407b is estimated to be around a decade (3.5 to 13.8 years), and its most probable mass is approximately 13 to 26 Jupiter masses, but with considerable uncertainty. The ringed body can be ruled out as being a star with mass of over 80 Jupiter masses at greater than 99% confidence. The ring system has an estimated mass similar to that of the Earth. A major gap in the rings at about 61 million km (0.4 AU) from its centre is considered to be indirect evidence of the existence of an exomoon with mass up to 0.8 Earth masses. J1407b is the first exoplanet or brown dwarf discovered with a ring system by the transit method. A sequence of occultations (eclipses) of the star occurred over a 56-day period in 2007. The pattern was consistent with that expected for the transit of a large array of multiple rings, indicating the substellar companion dubbed “J1407b”. The J1407b ring system has an outer radius of approximately 90 million km (about 640 times the extent of Saturn’s rings). Cleared gaps in the rings indicate satellites (“exomoons”) have formed accreted from denser rings. The young age of the stellar system (about 16 million years) and the high mass of the ring system (roughly an Earth mass) are more consistent with it being an early (proto-)exomoon or moons, rather than a long-term stable ring system in an evolved planetary system (such as Saturn's rings). J1407b has not been observed since its transit in 2007, suggesting that it is on a highly eccentric orbit around the star. Such a highly eccentric orbit around the star could disrupt the ring system of J1407b. Dynamical simulations ran by astronomers Steven Rieder and Matthew Kenworthy indicate that in order for J1407b's ring system to be stable, the rings must orbit J1407b in a retrograde motion, opposite to the direction J1407b orbits its host star. This retrograde solution for the ring system of J1407b allows for longer ring lifetimes as well as further constraints to the age of the ring system. The rings may be replenished over timescales as a result of processes that produce additional debris around J1407b, such as the tidal disruption of comets. From Earth's point of view, the ring system of J1407b would have an angular diameter of about 3.7 milliarcseconds across. For comparison, if Saturn were as many light years away, its rings in full breadth would be 0.006 milliarcseconds across.

The marriage was notoriously unhappy, and Trolle mocked Reetz in public. Mette Trolle was described as talented, educated, gifted and charming, and wrote poems in French and Dutch. She caused a scandal by her love affair with Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld. In 1670, when Griffenfeld wished to terminate their relationship and marry another, he convinced the King to appoint Jørgen Reedtz Danish ambassador to Spain and order her to accompany him there. However, she and Griffenfeld continued their love affair by correspondence. In Spain, Mette Trolle became a favourite of the regent of Spain, Mariana of Austria. She and several of her children converted to Catholicism, and when her spouse returned to Denmark in 1679, she remained. Regent Mariana awarded Mette Trolle a Spanish royal pension and the title Duchess of Avela. References * Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XVII. Bind.

After the 1973 energy crisis and the heavily increased oil prices, the ferry route got financial problems and was closed down by the headquarters in Stockholm in 1976. Their ferries departed twice every day and the total crossing time was about 10 hours. The shipping line was designed for lorries and drivers, but cars were welcome just as passengers without vehicles.

Christmas songs =Silent Night= Bing's holiday recordings began in 1935, when it was suggested that he record Silent Night and Adeste Fideles for the St. Columban Foreign Missionary Society. In a magazine article, Crosby gave the background to this. \\"Late that year (1934), a missionary priest, Father Richard Ranaghan, came into the office of Crosby Enterprises. A member of the St. Columban Missionary Fathers, he had just come from their mission in China with a film showing the work done there. He planned to travel over the United States, showing the film in parish auditoriums to raise funds, and wanted to borrow some sound equipment to record a narration. No problem to this, and in the ensuing discussion, my brother Larry came up with an idea. “Bing,” he suggested, “why don’t you sing a couple ·of songs for the narration sound track?” Who suggested “Silent Night” and “Adeste Fideles” I do not know, only I do know it was not I. Very possibly it was the good padre himself. In any event, the whole incident was just that casual. No special vocal arrangements were worked out, no particular method of styling devised. I just sang the way I sang other songs. That the hymns were a far cry from the romantic ballads and popular tunes I was accustomed to singing and that they might possibly have called for a different approach never occurred to us. The sound track turned out pretty well, and Father was enthusiastic. Then Larry hit upon another bright idea—that we cut some records of “Silent Night” and “Adeste Fideles” from the sound track for Father to take along with him. He figured that some members of the audience might buy them and thus add to the fund. The records sold well, and both sides were played over the radio in several of the towns where the film was shown. Record shops began to get inquiries. Decca, learning of these requests, suggested I cut a master record of the two hymns for them. I sang the songs in exactly the same way, but with fuller orchestral backing. The record had all immediate sale. Letters began to come in, both congratulatory and critical. Not to my knowledge, however, were there ever any complaints from religious groups or from the clergy of any denomination. Most of the protests came from music teachers and music critics. They said that neither my voice nor my styling was suited to such spiritual songs. In answering the letters, I told the simple truth—that I had intended no sacrilege by singing in my usual ballad manner. I added that the record’s sale must have brought those two beautiful songs closer to many people who had not known them too well before. The explanation evidently satisfied the critics, for all but one wrote back friendly and understanding notes…\\" Bing arranged for the profits from the record to be donated to charity.Voice of Christmas CD inner liner notes *2/21/1935- Crosby made his first recording for St. Columban Foreign Missionary Society. It was released on CD in 1998. *11/13/1935- Crosby made his second recording of the song on DLA 261 and this version charted in December 1935, December 1938 and December 1941. The disc was included in the Decca 78rpm album Christmas Music. *6/8/1942- Crosby made another recording of the song and it was included on Bing's compilation holiday album Merry Christmas *3/19/1947-Crosby made yet another recording of the song (the same day he re-recorded White Christmas) because Decca said that the master recordings for \\"White Christmas\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" had worn out because they stamped a lot of records. This was released in 1947 and went into the Billboard charts in December of that year. This version appears in all later incarnations of Merry Christmas. = White Christmas = White Christmas by far is Bing's biggest hit and the entire world's, since it has sold over 50 million copies; No song has ever come close to matching it. There are two versions of this song that were recorded in the studio and many outside of that used for TV and radio. *12/25/1941- Crosby performed White Christmas live on a Christmas Day radio broadcast for NBC's Kraft Music Hall. The recording was thought to be lost but the estate of Bing Crosby owns a copy. It is unclear whether that is the original copy on a disc or a radio airwave scan. *5/29/1942- Crosby first recorded White Christmas in the studio. It is stamped as Decca DLA 3009 on Disc 18429 with B-side Let's Start the New Year Right for the album Song Hits from Holiday Inn. An alternate copy recorded that same day was released in the 1998 compilation album Bing Crosby: The Voice of Christmas. *3/19/1947- Crosby recorded White Christmas again because Decca said that the \\"original master recording wore out\\". This version would soon replace the 1942 version and would become the standard. The 1942 version, because of no stamper disc in reasonable condition, was never released on 45rpm or LP records although it did appear in the 1998 compilation album Bing Crosby: The Voice of Christmas. Popular songs = Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral = *7/7/1944- Bing makes his first recording of the Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral. It was matrix number L3456 on Disc 18621. It was a single, and soon became a million-seller. *7/17/1945- Exactly one year and ten days later, due to mechanical difficulties with the first matrix, Crosby re-records the song for the album Selections from Going My Way. It was stamped as L3895 on Disc 18704. =Star Dust= Star Dust (sometimes spelled Stardust) is a song about love. It has over 1,500 recordings and is one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century. Bing Crosby made two main recordings during his career.Stardust (song) *8/19/1931- A very young Bing Crosby recorded the song first for Brunswick Records, stamped on disc 6169, with Dancing in the Dark as its B-side. *3/22/1939- Bing recorded the classic for Decca this time around, stamped as matrix # DLA 1733 on Disc 23285. An album was made based upon the song in 1940. =Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)= Coming into radio during the early 1930s, Crosby felt he needed a theme song. He co-wrote Where the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day and performed it as the theme for many of his radio show series. He made several recordings in the studio to be public releases with different record labels. *11/23/1931- While recording under Brunswick, Crosby makes his first recording of his theme song. *7/20/1940- Bing makes his second recording, the first for Decca in 1940. *7/17/1945- Second recording for Decca, L3897, often mislabeled as 1948 version =Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams= Shortly after leaving Paul Whiteman's band, The Rhythm Boys broke up because Crosby was beginning to be featured more and more on his own.Bing Crosby Rediscovered. PBS 2014. Bing recorded Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams with Gus Arnheim and His Cocoanut Grove Orchestra. *3/2/1931- Bing records the song with Gus Arnheim and his Cocoanut Grove Orchestra. *6/9/1939- Crosby waxes the record for Decca this time around, DLA 1767. *6/9/1939- A fluff take 'C' got out of the studio where Crosby joked \\"... he cut out eight bars, the dirty bastard...\\", \\"And I didn't know which eight bars he was gonna cut\\", \\"Why don't someone tell me these things around here.... holy christ I'm going off my nut\\". The version has been all over the media and countless bootleg pressings have been made of it. That version was released in the soundtrack to Bing Crosby Rediscovered, a documentary by American Masters.

Villanueva SDB (born December 20, 1947) is a Roman Catholic priest of the Salesians of Don Bosco, who was Rector Major of that Order between April 3, 2002 and March 25, 2014, being the 9th successor of Don Bosco,Biography Pascual Chavez. Salesians of Don Bosco. Link retrieved on January 27, 2015 the first Mexican to get such position and the second Latin American after Argentinian Juan Edmundo Vecchi. During the 26th General Chapter of the Salesians in Rome in 2008 he was confirmed for a second period, being the last Rector Major who could be reelected, because that same Chapter ruled that a Rector Major would not be reelected afterward.  Life  Chávez was born in San Luís Potosí, northern Mexico in 1947, but some years after his family moved to Saltillo, Coahuila. There he attended a Salesian school and got the idea to become a religious of Don Bosco, joining the Order in August 1970 in Guadalajara. On December 8, 1973 he was ordained priest in Jalisco. He finished Sacred Scripture at the Biblical Institute in Rome in 1977, then he started his apostolate as director of the Theological Institute of San Peter Tlaquepaque, Provincial Councilor of Mexico-Guadalajara and then Provincial Superior. He did a doctorate in Biblical Theology in Madrid from the Pontifical University of Salamanca.  Rector Major  His first approach to the leading position of the Salesians of Don Bosco came when he was elected as Regional Councilor during the 1996's 24th General Chapter with Fr. Juan Edmundo Vecchi as the Rector Major. He became then Councilor for the Inter- American Region, a Salesian administrative division in the Western Hemisphere that include Provinces in two continents: North America and northern South America. He would remain in that position until he was elected Rector Major in 2002. During his government, the Salesian Order celebrated the Beatification of Ceferino Namuncurá (August 26, 1886 - May 11, 1905) in November 2007, an Argentinian young man from the Mapuche people of Río Negro Province, Argentina. Chávez wrote a book on his life, \\"Ceferino Namuncura, Fruits of the Preventive System\\" (2004).Pascual Chávez Villanueva (2004). Cerefino Namuncurá, Fruits of the Preventive System. Salesian Bulletin, August 2004. In that same year, 2007, there was also the Beatification of the Spanish Salesian Martyrs. During the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939), about 232 religious and lay people were executed for their religious condition. Pope John Paul II beatified them as the Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War, in which many were Salesian priests and lay religious like Blessed José Calanzans Marqués, who was killed on November 23, 1936 in a road to Valencia. In that occasion, he wrote the letter \\"The blood of the martyrs, seeds of a new world\\" (2007). As Rector Major, he saw the celebration of different anniversaries in the history of the Salesian Family: the 150th anniversary of the death of Saint Dominic Savio (March 8, 2007), the 40th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council and the 150th anniversary of the foundation of the Salesian Order of Don Bosco (December 18, 2009.) He led the preparation of the Bicentenary of the Birth of Don Bosco (1815 - 2015), in which the relics of Saint John Bosco were brought to all Salesian Provinces around the world.Pilgrim Casket, 1815 - 2015.

Salomone Jr. (sometimes misspelled Salamone; 1919—March 16, 1993) was a Canadian-American hotelier of Italian descent, referred to by Ward Morehouse III as \\"one of the country's most respected hotelmen\\". He is best known for being the Vice President of the Hilton Hotel Corporation's Eastern properties and the manager of the prestigious Washington and New York Hiltons, and New York's Plaza Hotel, Ritz-Carlton, and the Waldorf Astoria New York. Early life and background Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Salomone was raised in Knoxville, Tennessee. In Knoxville he began working for the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville as a young man in the 1930s. In World War II he was promoted to a major, earning a Bronze Star for fighting in five battles in Europe. Career The Plaza Hotel in 2008 In 1947, Salomone began working for the Plaza Hotel of New York and later became its manager, before accepting a position as vice president of the Caribe Hilton in San Juan. In the 1960s he returned to the Plaza Hotel at a time of financial hardship, before becoming the president of the New York's Realty Hotels: the Barclay, Biltmore, Roosevelt and Commodore, later in the decade. By the 1980s, he was the managing director of New York's Hilton Hotel. He also held various important positions in the hotel industry including chairman of the National Hotel and Motel Exposition, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, chairman of New York's Council of Midtown Associations, vice chairman of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, and others. Salomone was also the chairman, president and chief executive officer of John B. Coleman Company, New York; Coleman had been the owner of the New York Ritz-Carlton and the Washington Ritz-Carlton. In 1982, he was honored with the Gold Key Award by the Avenue of the Americas Association. As the manager of the Plaza, Salomone was written into the Eloise series of books written by Kay Thompson, who was a long-time resident of the hotel. Salomone first appeared in print in Eloise: A Book for Precocious Grown-ups, published in 1955. When this book was made into a made-for television film for Walt Disney Television in 2003, Jeffrey Tambor played the role of Salomone. Tim Curry later lent his voice as Salomone in the 2006 animated series. Salomone, who was also a friend of Thompson, was quick to realize that publicity for the series of Eloise books also meant publicity for the Plaza. He was always ready to assist Thompson and her publisher in their ventures. Thompson wrote the last of her Eloise books, Eloise Takes a Bawth in the 1960s, but it was not published until 2002-some years after her death. Salomone appears again in this book, as he shows the small girl the flood she inadvertently caused while playing in the bath. Salomone was the manager of the Plaza when The Beatles arrived in the United States for their first Ed Sullivan Show appearance in early 1964. After seeing news footage of the crowds of young girls in the United Kingdom, Salomone worried that having the group as guests might be problematic for the hotel. He thought about canceling The Beatles' reservations, but was persuaded not to do so by his young daughter. Salomone and his wife, Bernadette, had three children: two sons, Robert and Gregg, and a daughter, Lourdes. References =Bibliography= * * External links * Alphonse W. Salomone, Plaintiff, v.

Leader of the Aycinena family, was in charge of setting up the government executive branch during this period, holding practically all of the Cabinet offices over the years. The liberal historians portray him as a villain in a despotic and tyrannical government headed by illiterate Raca Carraca - Rafael Carrera; However, research conducted between 1980 and 2010 has shown a more objective biography of both Pavón and Rafael Carrera and show that it was in fact Carrera who had the reins of the Conservative government.  Biography  Captain General Rafael Carrera, president for life of Guatemala. Pavón Aycinena attended the Pontifical University of San Carlos Borromeo and participated in the war against Francisco Morazán and his liberal forces under the command of the Governor of Guatemala, Mariano de Aycinena y Piñol as Lieutenant Colonel in the army. After Aycinena's defeat, he was banished by Morazan with another one hundred families belonging to the Aycinena clan, going into exile to Panama and then to the United States. He returned to Guatemala in 1837 when rebel general Rafael Carrera had asserted his authority in the state and managed to become one of his top aides and government ministers  Role in Rafael Carrera's government  = Executive branch = Pavón Aycinena held all the executive branch offices during Carrera's term as President; it is considered that Pavón Aycinena is responsible for the current setup of those branches. = Carrera Theater = Carrera Theater. Later on, the site became a market and on 6 Augusto 1832, then Guatemalan Governor, Dr. Mariano Galvez issued a decree to build a theater in the middle of Plaza Vieja. But the political situation of the country, with the continuous uprisings and civil wars between liberal and conservatives and a peasant revolt led by Rafael Carrera took down Galvez, who could not accomplish his infrastructure ambitions for the city. In 1852, Juan Matheu and Pavón Aycinena presented Rafael Carrera with a plan to build a majestic National Theater, that would be called Carrera Theater in his honor. Once approved, Carrera commissioned Matheu himself and Miguel Ruiz de Santisteban to build the theater. Initially it was in charge of engineer Miguel Rivera Maestre, but he quit after a few months and was replaced by German expert José Beckers, who built the Greek façades and added a lobby. This was the first monumental building ever built in the Republican era of Guatemala, given that in the 1850s the country finally was enjoying some peace and prosperity. Appleton's Guide to México and Guatemala of 1884 describes the theater as follows: «In the middle of the square is the Theater, similar in size and elegance to any of the rest of Spanish America. Lines of orange trees and other nice trees of brilliant flowers and delicious fragrances surround the building while the statues and fountains placed at certain intervals enhance even more the beauty of the place. = Carrera declared President for life = Copy of the decree by which Rafael Carrera was appointed President for Life of Guatemala in 1854 at the initiative of Pavón Aycinena After the Battle of La Arada, on 22 October 1851 presidente Mariano Paredes resigned; then the National Assembly named Carrera as his successor, being inaugurated as president on 6 November 1851 after having had the senators modify the Constitution to fit his needs. By then, Pavón Aycinena was suffering of intestine problems, which worsened with the beginning of spring each year, leaving him exhausted. In fact, on 5 May 1853 he became so ill that was put in hospice, but he managed to survive and work towards making sure that president Carrera was named president for life. Finally, on 25 October 1854, at the initiative of Pavón Aycinena, Carrera was declared \\"supreme and perpetual leader of the nation\\" for life, with the power to choose his successor; as such, Carrera served as President of Guatemala until he died on April 14, 1865.  Death  In February 1855, Pavón went to Escuintla to sped the season, but his health took a turn for the worse; the then returned to Guatemala City on 17 March, where in spite of the care of his doctor, Dr. Abella, his sickness progressed to a point that on 15 April a priest was called to comfort Pavón in his last moments. From that moment on, his confessor, —father Luis Amoros, S.J.— did not leave his side, and neither did his wife and siblings; he put his business in order and name his cousins Pedro de Aycinena —then Secretary of Interior— and Luis Batres Juarros —then Presidential Advisor— in charge in his inheritance. Pavón Aycinena was the first of the main allied of general Carrera to die; he died on 19 April 1855 at 5 a.m. in his home, and surround by his relatives and important ecclesiastic figures. General Carrera was in Chimaltenango, but from there sent instructions to take care of Pavón's funeral on 20 April. His funeral service took place in the Cathedral, where the main figures of the clerical and political circles of the country were in attendance. Later on, he was buried in La Merced Church. On 7 May 1855, upon returning from his business trip to Los Altos, Carrera commanded that a portrait of Pavón Aycinena were placed in the main room of the Presidential Palace and, taking in consideration the long list of Pavón's accomplishment, he granted his widow a lifelong pension equivalent to half of her deceased husband, —the largest pension ever granted in Guatemala up to that point.

In total, there are 26 tracks composed of early work, from when the band was known as The Ashes as well as their beginnings as The Peanut Butter Conspiracy. Background The Ashes were a folk rock group that briefly existed from 1965 to 1966. They released some singles on the Vault label that met with little success before disbanding in 1966. Three ex-members Alan Brackett, Barbara Robison, and John Merill along with newcomers Jim Foigt and Lance Fent formed the PBC in late 1966. The compilation is composed of seven official releases by the PBC that were recorded within the years 1966 and 1967. This includes their time with Vault Records and the jump to the larger Columbia Records label. Another seven, both released and unreleased, were recorded under the group's previous band, The Ashes. This compilation marked the first time The Ashes' recordings are distributed on compact disc. The Ashes' recordings are more folk rock orientated compared to the PBC's psychedelic style that is associated with them. Remaining are out-takes, demo recordings, and live takes of PBC recordings that were not yet officially released. The one live track, \\"You Should Know\\", was recorded in 1967, and gives a different perspective on the band that their studio albums could not capture. A twenty-page booklet of interviews and quotes from band members was written by Alec Palao and included in the album. The compilation was digitally re-released in 2013 by Ace Records.

In September 1989 he became a co-founder and leading member of the New Forum movement. His book \\"The Custodial State. On the Failure of Real-life Socialism\\" (\\"Der vormundschaftliche Staat. Vom Versagen des real existierenden Sozialismus\\") had appeared in April 1989 and was a powerful stimulus along the route to the Citizens' Movement that within a couple of years had led to the end of the German Democratic Republic as a standalone state. Life  =Early years= Henrich was born in Magdeburg, roughly equidistant between Hanover and Berlin, and on the eastern side of the border that divided East Germany from West Germany. After successfully completing his school career he went on to study Law at the Humboldt University in Berlin. At the age of 20 he joined the country's ruling SED (party) and three years later he became an Informal collaborator (IM / Informeller Mitarbeiter) for the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). Between 1964 and 1969 he is listed as an IM in the Stasi files under the code name \\"IM Streit\\". =The student= Twenty years later he would describe himself at age 20 as having joined the SED \\"out of conviction\\": \\"Back then\\", he later recalled, he was \\"even a bit fanatical\\"\\"[ich war]...begeisterter FDJler...Ich war damals sogar ein bißchen fanatisch. A powerful adumbration of future disenchantment with the East German regime nevertheless came in 1968, in the context of student discussions of the Prague Spring when he was officially reprimanded for \\"revisionism\\" and \\"psychologizing the law\\", and suffered the withdrawal of a previously agreed research scholarship. He was also required to change the subject of his dissertation, now addressing the subject \\"The next tasks of Soviet power\\" (\\"Die nächsten Aufgaben der Sowjetmacht\\"): he nevertheless accomplished his own task, receiving his degree-diploma with a top grade. =The young lawyer= After receiving his Law degree Henrich went on to perform his Military service in the National People's Army before taking a post as a research assistant at the prestigious \\"Walter Ulbricht\\" German Legal Academy (as it was known at the time) in the Babelsberg quarter of Potsdam. In 1973 he set himself up as a lawyer in Eisenhüttenstadt. Here he supported The Party within the local \\"Collective of Lawyers\\" (\\"Kollegium der Rechtsanwälte\\") as Party Secretary. During this period he also undertook further studies, almost certainly of a political nature, at the regional party academy in Frankfurt (on the River Oder). =Growing disenchantment= The arrest of Rudolf Bahro in 1977 affected Henrich deeply and he slowly became increasingly disillusioned with the East German regime and its Soviet-style Socialism, composing several highly critical essays (which remained unpublished). He would later recall his disenchantment, which had set in and then developed ever since he started to practice in Eisenhüttenstadt, with the way the law was applied in the German Democratic Republic. Nevertheless, Rolf Henrich remained a relatively discrete dissident through the early 1980s. He himself later spoke of the need he had experienced slowly to free himself from the old dogmatism as a laborious process of internal conflict.\\"Ich mußte mich erst langsam aus dem Dogmatismus befreien, das war ein mühsamer Prozeß innerer Auseinandersetzung.\\" He did, however, attract the interest of the Ministry for State Security whose principal office in Eisenhüttenstadt was in the Bergstraße (\\"Mountain Street\\"), close to his own office. For approximately two years, starting in 1987, the camera installed to monitor people entering and leaving the Ministry was positioned so that it could periodically swing round and point directly at Henrich's desk, through his office window across the road. =Into the limelight= Henrich's public profile was greatly raised with the publication in April 1989 of his book \\"The Custodial State. On the Failure of Real-life Socialism\\" (\\"Der vormundschaftliche Staat. Vom Versagen des real existierenden Sozialismus\\") There was at this time no question of anything so critical of the regime being published in East Germany: the book was published in West Germany where it received wide coverage in the broadcast and print media. The book's publication evidently came as a surprise to the authorities. It presented a devastating and detailed criticism of a state where socialism had not progressed beyond the \\"larval stage\\" (\\"Sozialismus im Larvenstadium\\") and the security services felt free to operate outside the law. In some ways it was a conscious follow-up to \\"The Alternative\\", the publication of which in 1977 had led to its author's arrest and subsequent deportation, but twelve years on Rolf Heinrich was much more analytically pessimistic about the way ahead for Socialism in the German Democratic Republic than Rudolf Bahro had been. In East Germany Henrich was expelled from the ruling SED (party) and excluded from the \\"Collective of Lawyers\\" (\\"Kollegium der Rechtsanwälte\\") which effectively terminated, for the time being, his legal career in Eisenhüttenstadt. The widespread assumption was that Rolf Henrich, like Bahro, would now be arrested and then deported or \\"sold\\" to the west. That did not happen this time, however, possibly because behind the scenes the East Germany leadership hardliners were themselves struggling with a loss of self-confidence resulting from the political loosening now under way in the Soviet Union itself. Another explanation is that the regime was aware of the scale of the publicity Heinrich's book had already received both within and outside the German Democratic Republic and did not arrest him \\"for political reasons\\". =New Forum= Early in September 1989, at Grünheide, Rolf Henrich was one of the 30 signatories of the founding proclamation that gave birth to the New Forum movement. By the end of 1989 more than 200,000 had signed the proclamation despite New Forum having been identified by the East German governing party as illegal. By this time, in any event, the Berlin wall had been breached by demonstrators on the eastern side early in November 1989, and when it became clear that the fraternal Soviet troops had no instructions to prevent people from crossing it, the gate was seen to have been left open for a reunification process that now appeared unstoppable. As part of that process, between December 1989 and March 1990 a Round Table forum was convened to work through the practical steps needed for German reunification. Rolf Henrich participated in the Round Table discussions on behalf of New Forum. Henrich set himself two principal tasks within the process. The hated Ministry for State Security had to be abolished. There had been some suggestion that the institution might be reconfigured as a new \\"National Security Agency\\" (\\"Amt für Nationale Sicherheit\\"). For Henrich, that would have been a mere re-labeling and as such totally unacceptable. His second task was to help draft and enact a new election law for East Germany, and to set a date for a democratically configured election to take place. On 18 March 1990 the first, and as matters turned out, last, free parliamentary election in the history of the German Democratic Republic was held. After this Rolf Henrich was satisfied that his own contribution to the Round Table exercise had been successfully completed. In November 1989 the de facto ban that seven months earlier had prevented him from working as a lawyer had been revoked and he was by now free to return to work at his lawyer's office in Eisenhüttenstadt. =Career options= Henrich later told an interviewer that Manfred Gerlach, who had been the East German head of state between 3 December 1989 and 18 March 1990, had offered him a job as President of the country's Supreme Court, but Henrich turned down that job along with an invitation to take a government post as secretary of state in the Ministry of Justice. Henrich evidently thought he might have independence issues or become a \\"figleaf\\" with a high-profile post in the East German judicial-political establishment. To maximize legitimacy, such jobs should go to an \\"outsider\\". There had also been a project involving the Gruner + Jahr publishing conglomerate to set up a pan-regional daily newspaper called \\"Die Ostdeutsche\\", based on the model of the highly successful Süddeutsche Zeitung. That project failed because the newspaper market turned out to be overcrowded already. German reunification formally took place in October 1990 and Rolf Henrich returned to his life as a provincial lawyer in Eisenhüttenstadt. His public profile never entirely vanished, however: he continued to give occasional press interviews and to publish the occasional book. In the courts he has worked as a defense lawyer in controversial cases including those involving former East German border guards charged in connection with shootings at the Berlin Wall.

Bajjaly (Eds.), The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq.] Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone & J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq (pp. 22) The Boydell press.] The world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the \\"treasure hunting\\" of old transformed into the beginnings of the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone & J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq (pp. 20) The Boydell press.] Destruction (2015) =Contents of ISIL video= In a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed \\"idolatrous\\". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah. A translation from the video is as follows: \\"These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries.\\" Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts =Damage= Not all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction. Assyrian *Nergal Gate: The Nergal Gate is located on the north side of Nineveh, an ancient Mesopotamian city located in present-day Mosul. The gate was built sometime between 704 and 690 BC, which was a time of expansion for Nineveh under the ruler Sennacherib. The gate is related to the ancient Mesopotamian god Nergal, who was associated with the summer solstice, war, destruction, and the netherworld. *Lamassu: At the Nergal Gate's entrance, and just within the entrance, stand the lamassu. These mythological figures first began appearing in art and architecture during the first half of the second millennium B.C., and are described as large winged human-headed bulls. Aside from being decoration, the lamassu are protective figures, more specifically described as \\"a benevolent spirit attached to an individual, group, a place or an entrance.\\" The lamassu erected at the entrance of the Nergal Gate at Nineveh are surrounded by relief sculpture that depicts the stages of transport of the human-headed bulls from quarries in Balatai.[Danrey, V. (2004). Winged Human- Headed Bulls of Ninevah: Genesis of an Iconographic Motif. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale. Vol. 66, Ninevah.] Lamassu and Balawat Gate in the British Museum Before the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts Balawat Gates The Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute.[J.E. Curtis & N. Tallis. (2009). The Balawat gates of Ashurnasirpal II. In Journal of the American Oriental Society. American Oriental Society. Vol. 129, No. 3. pp. 552-554.] The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a \\"'major' find from a 'minor'\\" site.[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In Iraq. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116] Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a \\"hollow-way\\" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur- Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In Iraq. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116] The displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market.Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise. Hatrene statues Hatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works.Ahmed, S. Said (1972). Hatra, Iraq. In Archaeology. Archaeological Institute of America. Vol. 25, No. 2. pp. 103-111.] Hatrene statue of Hercules The Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra Questioned authenticity of damaged artifacts According to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.The full story behind ISIL's takeover of Mosul Museum =Documentation= The 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.Learning from the Iraq MuseumWhat ISIS Destroys, Why, and Why We Must Document It The Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts. =Responses= Agencies involved *UNESCO Cultural Heritage Communities *Artist Uses 3D Tech to Recreate Past Destroyed by ISIS *Museums Responding to Mosul and Nimrud *Iraq's National Museum Reopens Earlier in Response to Outrage over Mosul *Project Mosul: Archaeologists Fight Back ISIS Heritage Destruction with 3D Museum Online See also *Mosul Museum *Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL *Mesopotamia *Archaeological looting in Iraq *List of destroyed heritage *UNESCO *Rekrei References External links * Heritage Monitor Category:Mosul Museum Category:Collections care Category:Museum collections Category:Art history Category:Museology Category:Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage ","title":"Destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts"},{"id":"45229333","text":"The Whitefin is a 92-foot sailing super yacht, racing in the \\"Spirit of Tradition\\" class.  Career  Whitefin was built between 1983 and 1984 in Camden, Maine, USA, by owner/builder Phil Long who, for the project, used the Renaissance Yacht shipyard he had created a few years before, to build the yacht Whitehawk. Both boats were designed by Californian designer Bruce King, who, after having established a reputation creating many successful, innovative ocean racing and cruising boats, moved from Newport Harbor, California, to Maine, to work on the Whitehawk project and, later, on the Whitefin project. These, for King, were just the beginning of a series of successful sailing maxi yachts like Signe (1990 - again with Renaissance Yachts), Hetairos (1993), Alejandra (1993), Sophie (1994 - again with Renaissance Yachts), Antonisa (1999), Maria Cattiva (2002) and Scheherazade (2003). Between 2000 and 2002, after almost twenty years had passed from her launch, Whitefin was given by her latest owner, Mr. Alfredo Canessa (who bought her from Pasquale Natuzzi), an eighteen months refitting, which brought her up to date with the most recent technology, in full respect of her original layout, both above and below deck, allowing her to win the most prestigious trophies in the most important regattas for her category, the Spirit of Tradition, such as: the Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup in Portocervo, Sardinia; the Vele d’Epoca di Imperia, Trofeo Prada or Trofeo Panerai, in Imperia, Liguria; and Les Voiles de Saint-Tropez, in Saint Tropez, France. With the advent of the actual ownership, from December 2014 to April 2015 Whitefin has undergone a deep upgrade preparing her to a new season of regattas. Whitefin is currently available for luxury charter.  Honours  The yacht's name is bound to the following international trophies: Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup 2002 (2nd classified), Vele d'Epoca di Imperia Trofeo Prada 2002 (1st classified), Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup 2003 (1st classified), Vele d'Epoca di Imperia Trofeo Prada 2004 (1st classified), Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup 2005 (2nd classified), Vele d'Epoca di Imperia Trofeo Panerai 2006 (3rd classified), Cannes Régates Royales 2015 (2nd classified), TAG Heur VELA Cup 2016 and 2017 (1st classified).  Description  Whitefin is built up in the WEST system fashion of multiple plies, precisely six plies each made up of 1-inch thick boards. The innermost ply and the four successive plies are Maine white cedar, while the outermost ply, laid longitudinally, is Port Orford (Oregon) Cedar. If the outside is state-of-the-art technology, combined with traditional style, the inside is pure delight of nineteenth century elegance: from the magnificent decagonal skylight and the fireplace in the main salon, to the hot tub in the owner’s suite, every part of this boat recalls the glorious years of the Gilded Era, when sailing was born as an exclusive sport for gentlemen, and them only.

Conolly (1917–2010) was a British botanist and teacher who contributed to quaternary botany and conducted important early work on the history and spread of Japanese Knotweed in the UK . Academic career She attended the University of Cambridge (Newnham College) from 1936 to 1940 and studied Natural Sciences. However, it was the University's policy at that time to not award degrees to women. She undertook doctoral studies on quaternary botany between 1940 and 1943, supported by a Rigby and a Francis Maitland Balfour studentships, under the supervision of Professor Harry Godwin. Her work contributed to the landmark book History of the British Flora published by Goodwin in 1956. Events in the Second World War meant that despite publishing several papers, she never submitted her thesis. Her first academic post commenced in 1944 as a demonstrator at Bedford College for Women, University of London, with conditional exemption from military service. In 1947 she was appointed as Lecturer at University College of Leicester (later University of Leicester) teaching plant classification, anatomy and distribution, where she remained until she retired in 1982. Her teaching of plant geography and taxonomy, especially the annual field course, were an inspiration to future botanists. Her research interest was initially quaternary botany but she developed several others. She was one of the first to become involved in the BSBI mapping scheme in the early 1950s and was principal recorder for at least six 10 km squares in North Wales. The flora of the Lleyn Peninsula, North Wales was a focus of her research for 50 years, especially the region around Pwllheli, continuing southwest of the A497 to Morfa Nefyn, mapped in 1 km squares. This expertise led to her becoming part of the management and recording of the natural history of Bardsey Island. Later Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica, subsequently reclassified as Reynoutria japonica) became her major research focus. She was made an Honorary Member of the BSBI in 2009 in recognition of her work for the society's meetings and publications. Research on Japanese Knotweed Japanese Knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), native to Asia, is one of the most damaging invasive alien plants in the world. It became her major research focus and led to publication of a groundbreaking analysis of the history and distribution of this invasive weed in 1977. She continued with this research for a further 20 years during her retirement. She used specimens from herbaria and information from the horticultural literature in Europe to show how the group of plants now called Japanese Knotweed changed from prizewinners in the Netherlands in 1847 to notifiable weeds in the UK in 1981. Her distribution maps showed how the Knotweed hybrids spread across the UK. An unusual hybrid knotweed, Conolly's knotweed,×Reyllopia conollyana (syn. Fallopia × conollyana) was named in her honour in 2001 for her 84th birthday. This is a hybrid between Japanese knotweed and Russian vine (Fallopia baldschuanica) and can form seeds that germinate, although with poor viability in the UK. Personal life She attended the private Montessori school in Purley followed by Eothen Girls School in Caterham (head girl 1934-5). She contracted polio in her teens when visiting continental Europe that resulted in impairment to her right leg. She died 17 August 2010. Significant publications *Bailey, J. P. Conolly, A. P.

He was Lord Mayor of Munich from 1925 to 1933 and again from 1945 to 1948, and in 1945 he co-founded the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU).  Life  Scharnagl first learned bakery and confectionery trades in the family business, but showed interest in a political career at an early age. His brother Anton Scharnagl was a clergyman. In 1911, at just 30 years of age, he was a deputy of the Center Party in the second chamber of the Bavarian Parliament. In 1918, after breaking off from the Centre Party, he was a member of the Bavarian People's Party, where he was a member of Parliament through two election periods 1920-1924 and 1928-1932. In 1917, he was also in the select committee of the Bavarian Association of the German Fatherland Party.  1919 to 1945  In 1919, Scharnagl was elected to the city council of Munich, 1925 vice mayor and in 1926 he was elected mayor of the city. As mayor, his attention was given to the expansion of the transport network as well as to housing. After the seizure of power by the Nazi Party in 1933, and after several clashes he resigned in office and returned to his learned profession as a baker. Although he was not involved in the failed assassination attempt of 20 July 1944, Scharnagl was arrested and detained in the Dachau concentration camp. After the liberation of the camp and the subsequent surrender of the German Wehrmacht, Scharnagl was placed by the US armed forces in May 1945 in the position as mayor of Munich. Together with Karl Meitinger he played an important role in the historicist reconstruction of the city center (\\"Scharnagl Plan\\") and was the initiator of the \\"Kulturbaufonds\\" Munich. To commemorate his plans for a traffic circle, a section of Altstadtring was named after him.  After 1945  Ostfriedhof, Munich In the summer of 1945 Scharnagl was one of the leaders in the preparations for the founding of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU). Through his organization, a meeting of twelve persons was held on August 14, which discussed the possibility of establishing a conservative-bourgeois party as a counterweight to the \\"socialist camp\\". A committee to prepare the party's founding was used and adopted at a further meeting on September 12, which is considered the actual founding meeting of the CSU, under the name of the Bavarian Christian Social Union. The statewide official founding as Christian Social Union, was on October 13 in Würzburg. On June 6, 1946 Karl Scharnagl was officially voted in as mayor in his office, but two years later he was defeated by Thomas Wimmer (SPD). He served one year as the second mayor, and then went into retirement in 1949. On May 22, 1945 Scharnagl received the allowance from the American military government the authority to re-establish the organization of the Red Cross for Bavaria. He called upon Adalbert Prince of Bavaria to become its president. On 1 June 1946 he was elected honorary president of the Bavarian Red Cross (BRK) and on 12 April 1947 he was elected president. 1948 Scharnagl co-founded the Society for Christian-Jewish Cooperation. From 1947 to 1949 he was a member of the Bavarian Senate. He was a member of the Catholic fraternity K.S.St.V. Alemannia Munich, Kartellverband. On April 6, 1963 Karl Scharnagl died.

Background The lordship of Diest, one of the smaller towns in the Duchy of Brabant, was part of the patrimony of the House of Nassau. In 1578 the town's magistrates were called upon to accept a rebel garrison, and had instead petitioned the king's governor general, Don John of Austria, to provide a royal garrison.Adriaan van Meerbeeck, Chronijcke vande gantsche werelt, ende sonderlinghe vande seventhien Nederlanden (Antwerp, Hieronymus Verdussen, 1620), p. 521. The town, strategically located at the crossroads of the roads from Maastricht to Antwerp and from Brussels to Roermond, was accordingly garrisoned by Walloon and German soldiers serving in the Army of Flanders. Taking of the town Just before dawn on 9 June 1580, a small force of French infantry soldiers serving the Dutch Republic, commanded by the Spaniard Alonso Vanegas, scaled the walls and killed the sentries.Edouard Van Even, Geschiedenis der stad Diest (1847), p. 172. They then opened the Zichem gate to a detachment of Dutch cavalry troopers from the garrisons of Mechelen and Herentals. The two Walloon companies of the garrison fled, but the three companies of Germans took defensive positions on the town square and fought to the last man. In the words of one chronicler:Meerbeeck, p. 554. > The three companies of Germans that were there, of the regiment of the Count > of Lodron, all experienced soldiers, fought valiantly against those of the > States, and with such ferocity and courage, that it was a wonder to see, by > the great constancy that they showed, such that one fell dead atop another, > without abandoning one another, to the last drop of blood in their bodies, > so that the victory of the States was a dear one. Aftermath As a result of the taking of Diest, the ungarrisoned nearby towns of Aarschot and Sichem also fell under the control of the States. William of Orange, hereditary lord of Diest, fined the town 60,000 guilders for having failed to take his side in the conflict.Van Even, p. 173 In 1582 a force of royal soldiers successfully scaled the town walls in an attempt to retake Diest, but they were unable to open a gate for their supporting cavalry, and after fierce fighting the survivors were taken prisoner.Meerbeeck, p. 584.

The ongoing research of her group focuses on the known existing clonally transmissible cancers arising in mammals. These are cancers that can be passed on between individuals by the transfer of living cancer cells that somehow manage to evade the immune system of their hosts. There are two diseases which cause clonally transmissible cancers. One is the devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), which appeared a few decades ago. This disease could make the Tasmanian devil, a marsupial that lives on the Australian island of Tasmania, go extinct. The other disease is the much older Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT), also known as Sticker sarcoma, a venereal tumor affecting dogs, which has spread worldwide. Elizabeth Murchison and her collaborators have been analyzing the genome of these cancer cells.Murchison EP et al. Genome sequencing and analysis of the Tasmanian devil and its transmissible cancer.

Built c. 1872, it is the least-altered surviving district school building of twelve originally built in the community. In the later years of the 20th century the school was used for town meetings and offices prior to the town's disincorporation in 2000. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The schoolhouse is a single story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a gable roof, weatherboard siding, and a rubblestone foundation. The main facade, facing east, has a central window flanked by two doorways, with a second window centered in the gable end. The doors and windows have simple trim. A remnant of a vertical flag pole extends upward from the upper window to the ridge line just below the small bell tower. The building is set on a sloping lot, exposing the basement in the rear, and there is a two-story ell there, which provides pit toilet facilities for the building. The two entries lead into separate vestibules, which lead into a single large chamber, which takes up the rest of the main block. These rooms are finished with horizontal pine wainscoting, and 20th-century wooden floors. Original blackboards are found on two walls. The basement of the building has modern finishes. The town of Madrid was settled in 1807 and incorporated in 1836. Its population peaked around 1860, at which time it had seven school districts and twelve schools. The property on which this building is believed to stand was sold to the town in 1872, and it is presumed that the school was built on it not long after (there is no evidence of other relevant property acquisitions by the town in the vicinity). The building was the last of the town's schools, operating until 1959. It was thereafter used as town hall, housing offices and the town polling station. The town disincorporated in 2000, and the building is now maintained by the Madrid Historical Society.

Cohan. The film stars Thomas Meighan, Mildred Harris, Charlotte Jackson, Nigel Barrie, Guy Oliver, Arthur Stuart Hull, and Sylvia Ashton. The film was released on November 13, 1921, by Paramount Pictures.Progressive Silent Film List: A Prince There Was at silentera.com Plot As described in a film magazine, wealthy Charles Edward Martin (Meighan) has been leading a shiftless, luxurious life and takes no interest in himself or others until a little boarding house drudge (Jackson), who sleeps under the stairs there and where she can hear the comings and goings of the residents, calls on him to seek his aid for a struggling young woman novelist, Katherine Woods (Harris), who lives there. The young millionaire had previously been urged to take the position as assistant editor of a popular magazine, but had declined, preferring a sodden life. The earnestness of the girl interests him and, more as an exploit than an ambition, he undertakes playing \\"fairy prince\\" to the novelist. He moves into the boarding house, where there are several humorous character sketches, and almost immediately falls in love with Katherine. He assumes the name Prince, and the novelist does not recognize him as the man whose money drove her father into financial ruin and suicide. She gives \\"Prince\\" the manuscript of a novel which he buys immediately. Charles then hastens to his magazine publisher friend Jack Carruthers (Barrie) to get it printed. Jack tells him that the magazine had already seen it and declined to publish the novel. Remembering the hope in Katherine's eyes when he pretended to buy the novel, Charles purchases the entire magazine publishing establishment, much to the consternation of his broker, J.J. Stratton (Hull). It turns out that the rather unscrupulous broker had manipulated Charles' funds so as to ruin Katherine's father without his client's knowledge.

The nickname makes reference to Silicon Valley, and was adopted because of the concentration of European headquarters of high-tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Indeed, Teckro and startups in the area. The number of tech professionals working in technology firms in the area is about 7,000. History In the wake of the dot-com bubble collapse from 1999-2001, IDA Ireland's director of operations in California, Dermot Tuohy, made moves to bring the at-the-time budding tech companies, PayPal, eBay, Overture (which would later become part of Yahoo!), and Google to Dublin. In 2002, Google executives agreed to investigate the possibility of opening operations in Dublin. They viewed the Digital Hub in the city centre west, which now houses 900 people and is the location for the European headquarters of companies such as Eventbrite and Etsy. Google's property advisors at the time also alerted them to an alternative location at Grand Canal Dock, identifying the potential of a number of buildings on Barrow Street owned by developer Liam Carroll. Within walking distance from the city centre, the location was seen by the company as having the right mix of factors to attract the type of employee they wanted in Dublin. Google's California offices encouraged a college campus-style atmosphere, something achievable in the Grand Canal Dock location. The visitors decided that once the building, which was still under construction, was complete, they would rent 60,000sq ft of Gordon House on Barrow Street, which they moved into in 2004. It's a choice still seen by those in the IDA as a seismic shift for investment in Dublin. The agency, and many others including senior Google employees, feel the decision was directly responsible for many other Silicon Valley names, such as Twitter and Facebook, choosing to set up shop nearby. Many of the new buildings around Grand Canal Dock were completed in 2007, just as the financial crisis hit Ireland. This meant that many of these high-end buildings stood empty in the period of economic uncertainty that followed. Since 2012 in the wake of Ireland's economic recovery, international investors have been buying prime office space in the area. In November 2013, a new fast-track planning scheme was approved by Dublin City Council to allow for docklands buildings of up to 22 floors in height – 50% higher than Dublin's tallest building. The Docklands Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) Planning Scheme gives council planners the power to make decisions that cannot be appealed to An Bord Pleanála, ensuring a minimum of delay for developers. The SDZ represents the first major planning initiative since the 2012 decision to wind up the Docklands Authority, but to retain an appropriate fast track planning framework to complete the Docklands project. Dublin City Council, which is taking over the Docklands Authority's powers, is determined to encourage the continued development of the 66 hectares, north and south of the river, that comprise the new planning zone. The plan identifies five specific development hubs: Spencer Dock, Point Village, Grand Canal Dock, Britain Quay and Boland's Mill. One third of the overall docklands area – 22 hectares - is ready to be developed. Buildings left uncompleted since the financial crisis are now progressively being completed. Most notably, the former Anglo Irish Bank building, the unfinished skeleton of which was an icon of the financial crisis, was finished in 2017 by its new owner, the Central Bank of Ireland. It should also be noted that due to the housing crisis in Dublin, and the marked increase in the cost of living, there is now pressure on tech firms to retain staff in the Silicon Docks area. Many of whom are looking elsewhere in Ireland to establish offices where the cost of living is more affordable. =Etymology= The name Silicon Docks first appeared in 2011 as the area made a comeback amidst economic recovery after the projects were left unfinished during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Since then, the term appeared in several articles by various media sources as well as Google Dublin's homepage.Google A book titled Silicon Docks: The Rise of Dublin as a Global Tech Hub by Pamela Newenham was released 22 January 2015, published by Ireland's Liberties Press. Other nicknames for the area include the Google Basin. Development View of the western (inner) basin from the top floor of the Google Docks (Montevetro) building. Boland's Mill, the Alto Vetro building, and The Marker Hotel can be seen. While it has been reported that the reasons behind the development of Silicon Docks are 'scarce' or 'challenging', three areas are generally focused on, including corporate tax incentive, human capital, and seed funding. =Corporate tax incentive= Ireland's low corporate tax rate—just 12.5%--has long attracted entrepreneurs, and was once the country's key selling point for foreign business owners. However, the tax implications that companies face in major deals have been described as an \\"impediment\\". The headline rate of Capital Gains Tax ('CGT') was 33% as of August 2019. =Human capital= Ireland boasts the youngest population in all of Europe. In 2012, Citibank's annual list of most competitive cities in the world ranked Dublin as the city with the best \\"human capital.\\" The city is home to dozens of colleges and universities, including Dublin City University, Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, and Technological University Dublin. The local talent pool has received a boost from Google, which opened its Dublin headquarters in 2002 and has since been recruiting highly trained tech talent from all around the world, thanks to Ireland's lenient work visa process. As of 2015, Google employs some 3,500 people in Dublin. Facebook, LinkedIn, Fleetmatics and Twitter, among others, employ hundreds more. =Seed funding= The Competitive Start Fund of Enterprise Ireland invests in 15 seed stage start-ups every quarter. There are also other accelerators in the city offering start-ups much-needed seed funding, including Launchpad. However, Prof Vinny Cahill, Dean of Research and computer science lecturer at Trinity College Dublin, explained in 2012, \\"There is definitely a growing venture capital community here. But if you look at Silicon Valley, there's a network of people who have been through the business and who encourage investment. It's starting to evolve in Dublin, but we're not at Silicon Valley's level yet.\\" Tech companies located in Silicon Docks The following is a list of just some of the tech companies located in the Silicon Docks area, divided into geographical areas.

Despite the best efforts of museum staff, museums often have FIC items. This term was developed so that collections with incomplete provenance would be handled ethically and with transparency. Depending on the paperwork and information accompanying the material, the museum has several choices in how to proceed. Occurrences Museums today are meticulous about the documentation they keep when accessioning new items into their collections. However, this was not always the case. As the museum field professionalized so did the standard of paperwork required to accession a collection. Items can become FIC artifacts if records were not kept initially or if the documentation regarding the property transfer was lost in a disaster such as a fire or flood. Additionally, if the museum is old, it has decades of accessioning paperwork that may require its own preservation plan. =Lapsed loans= FIC collections can also be the result of long-term or permanent loans where contact has lapsed between the two parties. It is for this reason that most museums now renew their loans on an annual basis.  Key participants *Registrar/Collections Manager: Ultimately registrars and collections managers are in charge of accession paperwork and artifact documentation. Collections staff are responsible for assembling as much information as possible on the provenance of the objects in order to help the Collections Committee and other staff make the most informed decision they can. * Collections Committee: A Collections Committee at a museum is composed of curators, collections staff, educators and senior administrators who decide what will become part of the museum's collection based on the museum's collections management policy. Just as importantly, the Committee rules on items that should be removed from a museum's collection due to duplication or lack of relevance to the museum's mission. The Committee will also discuss collections related issues including any FIC artifact concerns. *Legal Counsel: The Collections staff and legal counsel need to work closely together. There are very specific laws governing museums and unclaimed property. *Director/President & Board of Trustees: The Director and Board of Trustees all need to sign off and be aware of accessions and deaccessions to their museum's collection. They rely heavily on the recommendation of the Collections Committee. *Public Relations Officer: While museums try to deal with FIC items openly, the knowledge that museums may not have complete intellectual and physical control of their collections can sometimes cause controversy or public concern. The Public Relations Officer is in charge of explaining how museum's work, how the situation has occurred, and what is being done to solve the problem. Public education and transparency can go a long way towards keeping the relationship between the community and museum positive. * Claimant: During the FIC process a claimant may come forward to stake a claim to the found property. Depending on the nature of the claim and whether or not the claimant is a person or organization different procedures will be followed. However, the claimant must provide some type of documentary evidence to support their position. What constitutes ownership Museums require three pieces of information to accession a collection. # Written intent to donate on behalf of the donor. # Acceptance of the collection into the museum's holdings by the museum (usually through the Collections Committee). # Physical possession of the collection. The most common way this is achieved is through a Deed of Gift, which states these three criteria in one document What action can be taken Please seek professional legal advice when dealing with FIC materials. Regardless of whether or not the museum wishes to retain ownership of the item, if possible the collections staff should contact the previous owner to either obtain a deed of gift or return the collection. =Short term= In order to keep track of the FIC collection, a temporary number should be assigned that is completely different in format from the museum's accession number to avoid further confusion. Whether the item is to be accessioned or deaccessioned, it requires establishing a chain of custody, which can be started with the application of a temporary number and assemblage of any associated documentation. =Long term= *If the museum wishes to keep the collection: It should try to obtain ownership by following its state's unclaimed property laws or applicable international conventions. If during the found property process a claimant wishes to challenge the museum's tie to the collection, the claimant must support their case with evidential paperwork. * If the museum does not want the collection: If the museum does not want to keep the artifacts due to them being irrelevant to its mission or outside of its collecting scope, it has several options. If the museum can contact the previous owner or heirs it should do so and return the collection. If the collection has no associated paperwork, the museum should follow the appropriate laws and conventions. Once it establishes ownership through that process the museum can legally and ethically follow its deaccession procedures. This may involve transfer the collection to another cultural institution, selling the collection at public auction, or if all other methods fail, destruction of the collection.  International conventions  The 1970 UNESCO Convention was created to provide a platform and environment in which countries could discuss situations in which cultural property may have been illegally transported. Throughout history cultural property has been taken as the spoils of war or trafficked by desperate individuals in order to make a profit. For this reason museums may have to consider the 1970 UNESCO convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property when sifting through FIC collections. It is important to pay particularly close attention to documentation of items that may have been acquired from conflict zones as sometimes customs forms and bills of sale are faked. Federal legislation = Antiquities act of 1906 = The Antiquities Act of 1906, signed by Theodore Roosevelt, was the first federal law enacted in response to a growing concern regarding the protection of cultural property. The law stated that antiquities could not be removed or damaged on federal property without the express permission of the government. While not completely enforced in its day, it did set a precedent for caring for national cultural property. = Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 = The Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) was a much needed upgrade to the 1906 Antiquities Act. It updated definitions to close loopholes and increased fines and penalties for violators. If museums have FIC collections that may have been obtained in violation of the 1906 and 1979 legislation, they should seek legal advice and follow the provisions in the Acts. =Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act= The Native American Graves Protection Act (NAGPRA) was signed into law in 1990 to specifically to \\"affirm the rights of lineal descendants, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations to custody of Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony that are in the control of federal agencies and museums\\". Unfortunately throughout the history of the United States, Native American cultural property and even human remains were not acquired with the consent, let alone documentation. Because of this, Native American and Native Hawaiian artifacts are often FIC. In trying to resolve these culturally sensitive FIC items, NAGPRA legislation should be followed. Unclaimed property laws by state While most unclaimed property laws refer to unclaimed finances, the procedures regarding artifacts are similar. # Alabama # Alaska # Arizona # Arkansas # California #Colorado #Connecticut #Delaware # Florida # Georgia #Hawaii #Idaho # Illinois #Indiana #Iowa #Kansas #Kentucky #Louisiana #Maine #Maryland #Massachusetts #Michigan # Minnesota # Mississippi #Missouri # Montana #Nebraska #Nevada #New Hampshire #New Jersey #New Mexico #New York #North Carolina # North Dakota # Ohio #Oklahoma #Oregon #Pennsylvania #Rhode Island #South Carolina #South Dakota #Tennessee #Texas #Utah #Vermont #Virginia #Washington #West Virginia #Wisconsin #Wyoming References  Other resources  * Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition Edited by Rebecca A.

Ferguson syllabus provides a space for educators to discuss integrating the events happening in Ferguson into classrooms. Background On August 9, 2014 an unarmed and noncompliant black teenager, Michael Brown, was fatally shot by white police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. The disputed details of Brown's death sparked protests and civil unrest in Ferguson, across the United States, and internationally. The dispute arose from dueling narratives of why and how the altercation occurred. Officer Wilson and eyewitnesses argued different accounts of what happened. This confusion, along with aggressive policing following Brown's death, led to heated debate and examination of the relationship between policing practices and communities of color. The protests and civil unrest continued on November 24, 2014 after a St. Louis grand jury found Darren Wilson not guilty of criminal charges. After the verdict was announced protests flared in Ferguson and in nearly every major U.S. city. On November 29, 2014, Darren Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department with no severance or benefits. Although over $500,000 was raised by Wilson's supporters via crowdfunding. On March 4, 2015 The United States Department of Justice announced the findings of its two civil rights investigations into the Ferguson Police Department. The Justice Department found that the Ferguson Police Department “engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the First, Fourth, and 14th Amendments of the Constitution.” In Ferguson—a city with a population of 21,000–16,000 people have outstanding arrest warrants, meaning that they are currently actively wanted by the police. In other words, if you were to take four people at random, the Ferguson police would consider three of them fugitives. The Justice Department also stated, “That the evidence examined in its independent, federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Michael Brown does not support federal civil rights charges against Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson.” Purpose Ferguson syllabus is a crowdsourced syllabus about race, African American history, civil rights, and policing. Ferguson syllabus was created as a way to integrate conversations of what happened in Ferguson into classrooms. Dr. Marcia Chatelain, graduate from University of Missouri-Columbia and assistant professor of history at Georgetown University, created the hashtag #fergusonsyllabus so that educators could have a platform to discuss the national crisis in Ferguson, Missouri. Chatelain describes it as, “What emerged was a small call for community across the sometimes impersonal and expansive digital world.” Chatelain contacted her colleagues in and across her discipline to use Twitter as a mechanism to recommend texts, collaborate on conversation starters, and inspire dialogue about some aspect of the Ferguson events. Chatelain argues, “The academy has never owned movements, and youth outside of colleges longed for intelligent questions, honest reflection, and inspiration moving forward.\\" Collegiate professors, high school teachers, early education specialists, guidance counselors and middle-school instructors wanted ideas on how to hold purposeful dialogues around this issue. #FergusonSyllabus has now become a virtual movement used to frame how struggle has shaped American history, infused works of art and literature, and given voice to those most hurt by the failures of leadership, capitalism, and democracy. Applications =Freedom Ferguson Library= Freedom Ferguson Library is a campaign asking people who benefited from learning from the Ferguson syllabus to consider donating an item to an under-resourced school, prison literacy program, or community center. Professor Marcia Chatelain has asked that people write (or make a nameplate) with a message including the words, Ferguson Freedom Library. The expression Freedom Library comes from the Freedom Summer Project of 1964. Civil rights activists created Freedom Schools to educate children and adults. =Ferguson Theater Syllabus= Inspired by the #FergusonSyllabus, actors and playwrights crowdsourced a list from the Ferguson Moment Facebook group, asking specifically for plays that provide opportunities for conversation around this particular historical moment: the shooting of Michael Brown and the response to that shooting by citizens, law enforcement and the justice system, in Ferguson and in other places like it around the nation.

The interior is finished with vertical board wainscoting, original blackboards, and a 1927 pressed metal roof. The town of Bucksport had eighteen school districts at its height in 1859. Over the course of the second half of the 19th century it experienced a significant decline in population, resulting in the closure and consolidation of many schools. This school was built in 1895 to replace a dilapidated older structure, after long public debate over whether to consolidate further rather than build a new building.

Biography  Born in Alma, Michigan, Goggin obtained his BS in chemistry, Physics and Mathematics at Alma College in 1933, and at the University of Michigan his BS in Electrical Engineering in 1935 and his MS in Electrical Engineering in 1936. Goggin spend his most of his career at Dow Chemical Company, where he started after graduation in 1936 in the Student Training Program. He got further acquainted with the company as Engineer in the Physics Research Laboratory from 1937 to 1939, and as Salesman in the Special Products Division from 1939 to 1941. In 1941 he started in management as Assistant Manager in the Plastics Sales Division, where he became manager in 1942 and manager in the Plastics Development Division in 1943. In 1947 he moved to the Plastics Technical Service, and in 1959 became General Manager of the Plastics Department. In 1967 he moved to the Dow Corning Corporation, where he was President and Director until 1971, and then became its Chairman of the Board until 1976. In 1954 Goggin was awarded an Honorary D.Sc. from Alma College, and in 1976 he was listed unto the Plastics Hall of Fame.  Work  = Multidimensional organization = As CEO of Dow Corning from 1967 to 1971 Goggin developed a type of organization structure, which became known as the Multidimensional organization. In the 1974 article \\"How the multidimensional structure works at Dow Corning\\" in the Harvard Business Review, Goggin described the occasion and motivation of his innovation as follows: > Although Dow Corning was a healthy corporation in 1967, it showed symptoms > of difficulty that troubled many of us in top management. These symptoms > were, and still are, common ones in U.S. business and have been described > countless times in reports, audits, articles, and speeches. Our symptoms > took such form as: # Executives did not have adequate financial information > and control of their operations. Marketing managers, for example, did not > know how much it cost to produce a product. Prices and margins were set by > the division managers. # Cumbersome communications channels existed between > key functions, especially manufacturing and marketing. # In the face of > stiffening competition, the corporation remained too internalized in its > thinking and organizational structure. It was insufficiently oriented to the > outside world. # Lack of communication between divisions not only created > the antithesis of a corporate team effort but also was wasteful of a > precious resource-people. # Long-range corporate planning was sporadic and > superficial; this was leading to overstaffing, duplicated effort, and > inefficiency. Fearing that our problems would become worse instead of better > in the future, we undertook major changes in our organizational structure. > We turned to a matrix concept of organization-what we later came to call the > multidimensional organization.Goggin (1974, 54) When Goggin had joined Dow Corning, the organization was structured as matrix organization. As main building blocks were seen the profit center and cost center. Goggin explained, that in the concept of the multidimensional organization, two extra dimensions were added: > As we first thought of it, the matrix organization was to be two- > dimensional... the different businesses in Dow Corning were seen as: # > Profit centers. These were the different businesses the company was in. > Businesses were defined along product lines-for instance, rubber, > encapsulants and sealants; resins and chemicals; fluids, emulsions, and > compounds; specialty lubricants; and consumer, medical, and semi-conductor > products. In most of the cases each business's product line served a related > group of industries, markets, or customers. # Cost centers. These were > functional activities and included marketing, manufacturing, technical > service and development, and research, as well as a number of supportive > activities, such as corporate communications, legal and administrative > services, economic evaluation, the controller's office, the treasurer's > office, and industrial relations. > But soon we came to see further dimensions of the system: # Geographical > areas. Business development varied widely horn area to area, and the profit- > center and cost-center dimensions could not be carried out everywhere in the > same manner... # Space and time. A fourth dimension of the organization > denotes fluidity and movement through time (see Part D). The > multidimensional organization is far from rigid; it is constantly changing. > Unlike centralized or decentralized systems that too often are rooted deep > in the past, the multidimensional organization is geared toward the future. > Long-term planning is an inherent part of its operation.Goggin (1974, 55) About Geographical areas Goggin further explained \\"that each area is considered to be both a profit and a cost center. Dow Coming area organizations are patterned after our major U.S. organization. Although somewhat autonomous in their operation, they subscribe to the overall corporate objectives, operating guidelines, and planning criteria. During the annual planning cycle, for example, there is a mutual exchange of sales, expense, and profit projections between the functional and business managers headquartered in the United States and the area managers around the world.\\"  Selected publications  * De Bell, John M., William C.

Edmund William Creswell (7 November 1849 – 1 May 1931) was a British soldier, who played for the Royal Engineers in the 1872 FA Cup Final. As a soldier, he was engaged mainly in administrative work and never saw active service. Family and education Creswell was born in Gibraltar on 7 November 1849, the son of Edmund Creswell (1800–1877) and his wife Mary Margaret née Fraser (1826–1892). His father had been appointed postmaster of the colony of Gibraltar in 1831; in 1857, he secured funding from London for building a new post office, and amalgamated the two previous postal services, thus founding the Royal Gibraltar Post Office. Creswell was educated at Bruce Castle School, Tottenham, London followed by the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (RMA) until 1870. Creswell's brother William (1852–1933) became a vice-admiral and is known as the \\"father\\" of the Royal Australian Navy. Another brother, Frederic (1866–1948) was a Labour Party politician in South Africa, who was Minister of Defence from 1924 to 1933. A sister, Mary Catherine (1857–1892) married one of Creswell's teammates from the 1872 FA Cup Final, Hugh Mitchell in 1878. Football career The Royal Engineers team of 1872. Eight of these players played in the first FA Cup Final. Creswell is seated third from the left Creswell represented Bruce Castle School and the RMA at football. He was Secretary of the Royal Engineers Association Football Club, which, in November 1871, was among fifteen teams who entered the inaugural FA Cup competition, and were allocated a home match in the first round against Reigate Priory. Reigate Priory, however, withdrew from the competition, sending the Engineers through to the next round on a walkover. In the second round, the Engineers beat Hitchin 5–0 on 10 January 1872. At the quarter-final stage, the Engineers beat Hampstead Heathens 3–0, setting up a semi-final against Crystal Palace which was won 3–0 after a replay. The first FA Cup Final was played at Kennington Oval on 16 March 1872 between the Royal Engineers and Wanderers, the top amateur club of the day. Ten minutes into the match, Creswell was seriously injured, breaking a collar-bone in a charge on goal. Despite suffering tremendous pain, he refused to leave the pitch and played the remainder of the match out of the action as a \\"passenger\\" on the wing. Wanderers took the lead fifteen minutes into the game when Morton Betts opened the scoring from an acute angle after Robert Vidal's long dribble. Wanderers continued to exert further pressure on the Engineers' goal and, despite a late rally from the Engineers, Wanderers were able to hold on to their lead and the game ended in a 1–0 victory in their favour. In its report on the match, The Sportsman commented: \\"Too much praise cannot be accorded to him for the pluck he showed in maintaining his post, although completely disabled and in severe pain, until the finish\\". Although Creswell's football career was short, he remained an active sportsman for a long period. He played cricket for the Royal Engineers and other clubs, including the Gentlemen of Hampshire, between 1868 and 1886. Military career Creswell graduated from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich on 8 January 1870, joining the Royal Engineers with the rank of Lieutenant. Fellow graduates on the same day were two of his fellow FA Cup finalists, Hugh Mitchell and Henry Rich. Creswell was promoted to Captain twelve years later and was further promoted to Major on 1 August 1888 and to Lieutenant-Colonel on 12 August 1895, becoming a full Colonel on 12 August 1899. During his service with the Royal Engineers, Creswell was engaged mainly in administrative work and never saw active service. Between January 1870 and August 1872, he was based at Chatham, before going to India on 23 October 1872 where he worked as an assistant engineer until he returned to Chatham in February 1880. Between 1 April 1881 and 31 March 1888, he was seconded to the Ordnance Survey before going to South Africa on 19 April 1888. He returned to England on 18 November 1892 and was then based at Liverpool until 3 June 1894, when he was transferred to Shoeburyness in Essex. On 12 January 1897, he returned to India, where he remained until he retired from the army on 12 August 1900. Wives and children On 30 January 1875, he married Emma Mary Carver (1853–1899) at Byculla, Bombay, India. The couple had nine children, including a son Edmund Fraser Creswell (1876–1941), who became a Colonel in the Royal Artillery. Awarded the Distinguished Service Order in World War One, he worked for the Ammunition Department of the Ministry of Supply in the Second World War, and died following an accident on 5 November 1941. Following the death of Emma on 11 May 1899, Edmund Creswell married Isabel Agnes Vulliamy (1869–1956) from Paris, in St Marylebone, London on 19 October 1907. Their only child was Sir Michael Justin Creswell (1909–1986) who was the UK Ambassador to Finland, from 1954 to 1958, Yugoslavia from 1960 to 1964, and Argentina from 1964 to 1969.

He was killed in the 1902 Fermin rebellion when he refused to surrender his ship to the German warship . A naval base in Port-au-Prince is named after him. In 1943, he was honored with a postage stamp. Early life Killick was an \\"Anglo-Haitian mulatto.\\" His father was of either Scottish or Irish descent. Military service Haiti in Killick's time was a poor country, and its navy was ill-equipped, with many of its officers serving under contract from other nations. At any given time, the number of ships in the Navy ranged between two and four. An observer in 1899 described obsolete, possibly un-seaworthy ships badly in need of paint being cannibalized for parts. Sailors in the navy often had to go without pay, and often had little, poor quality food. Moreover, the political situation in Haiti was not stable, with President Florvil Hyppolite facing revolts and rebellions, and the scorn of the international community. As the Admiral of this poorly equipped, underfunded force a significant amount of Killick's resources went to trying to acquire more ships. In January 1894 an American yacht called the Natalie sailed out of Savannah, went missing and was presumed lost. There were rumors that the Natalie was carrying arms and ammunition to be used in a plot to overthrow Hyppolite, but her captain denied that there were any weapons on board, and claimed the trip was just a pleasure cruise. The Natalie was spotted near Long Cay, Bahamas in February. A short time later two Haitian vessels, the Defence and the Dessalines, with Killick on board, showed up near the Natalie. The Defence was carrying $25,000 in American gold to purchase the Natalie, and the Dessalines was carrying $60,000 in gold coin for the purchase of the Natalie. Killick and the Natalie's captain negotiated a purchase of the Natalie for £5,208 6s 8d, roughly $25,000. The Natalie was retrofitted in Savannah and added to the Haitian Navy. In 1896 Haiti was able to add a brand new ship to its fleet, the Crête-à-Pierrot. The Crête-à-Pierrot was commissioned to be the flagship of the navy. It was built in England and armed in France. It had 11 guns, could steam 15 knots, and displaced 940 tonnes of water. In 1899 the captain commented about how often the Admiral came aboard. In July 1898, Admiral Killick caused some anxiety in the international community when he went missing for nineteen days. Rebellion and death In May 1902, Haitian President Tirésias Simon Sam resigned in embarrassment over Haiti's inability to assert itself in the international community after the Emil Lüders incident. The 1889 constitution provided for the National Assembly to name a president, but there was an uprising demanding direct elections. A provisional government was created to oversee the election of deputies who, together with the National Assembly would appoint the president. Anténor Firmin soon emerged as a popular favorite, but he was opposed by the military and the provisional government, which both supported Pierre Nord Alexis. By June 1902 a civil war had broken out between the supporters of Firmin and the supporters of Alexis. Admiral Killick declared his support for Firmin very early on, and his support meant that although Alexis had the support of the military, Firmin had the support of the navy, and full control of the coast. As of 15 May, Killick had not only declared for Firmin, but taken the flagship of the Haitian Navy, the Crête-à-Pierrot, to Cap-Haïtien to pick up Firminist troops and transport them to Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile, the rest of the Haitian Navy, comprising a single ship, the Toussaint Louverture, was in Gonaïves, where Firmin had many supporters. Firmin campaigned to be elected deputy of both his hometown Cap-Haïtien, and Gonaïves. He was elected deputy for Gonaïves, but on June 28 fighting broke out in Cap-Haïtien between his supporters and troops controlled by Alexis, who had been sent there to supervise the elections. After the fighting broke out Firmin embarked on the Crête-à-Pierrot and sailed to Gonaïves. There he continued to protest against the way the elections were being conducted. Killick, meanwhile, proceeded to bombard Cap-Haïtien with both ships. When he left Cap-Haïtien he accidentally ran the Toussaint Louverture aground on a reef, but through the rest of the summer Killick and the Crête-à-Pierrot transported soldiers for the Firminist cause, attacked coastal towns, and isolated and slowly demobilized Alexis' forces. Meanwhile, Jean Jumeau marched on Port-au-Prince by land. Due to his role in the conflict between Firmin and Alexis, Killick was decommissioned by July 12. Although the disrupted, disputed elections were still on-going in July, by July 26, Firmin had been declared president by inhabitants of Artibonite and several other regions of Haiti, Jumeau's land forces were reported to be within one day's march of Port-au-Prince, and the Crête-à- Pierrot was in the harbor at Port-au-Prince. Eventually, Killick attempted to establish a blockade of the harbor at Cap-Haïtien. On September 2, 1902, Killick and his crew seized a German ammunition ship, the Markomannia en route to Cape Haitian to provide ammunition to Alexis' forces. Alexis asked Germany for help subduing a pirate ship. In response, Germany sent the gunboat to find and capture the Crête-à-Pierrot. On September 6, the Crête-à-Pierrot was in port at Gonaïves, with Killick and most of the crew on shore leave when the Panther appeared. Killick rushed on-board and ordered his crew to abandon ship. When all but four crew members had evacuated the ship Killick, inspired by the tale of Captain LaPorte, wrapped himself in a Haitian flag, fired the aft magazine, and blew up the ship, along with the arms that were supplied by German merchants, rather than let the Germans take her. Killick and the remaining four crew members went down with the ship. An hour later, the Panther fired thirty shots at the Crête-à-Pierrot to finish it off, then sailed away. The ship's rifles and machine guns were salvaged. Killick's body was recovered and buried that same day. Killick's sacrifice was seen as the ultimate act of patriotism, yet Firmin's struggling revolution was doomed to failure by the loss of the Crête-à-Pierrot and the support of Haiti's navy. Within a month Firmin went into exile in Saint Thomas, Barbados, where he died in 1911.

She is a writer and public speaker on the topics of rationality, science, technology, and design. She hosts Rationally Speaking, the official podcast of New York City Skeptics, which she has done since its inception in 2010, sharing the show with co-host and philosopher Massimo Pigliucci until 2015.  Biography  Galef was born in 1983 in Maryland into a Jewish family. She received a BA in statistics from Columbia University. In 2010 she joined the board of directors of the New York City Skeptics. She co-founded and became president of the nonprofit Center for Applied Rationality in 2012. The organization also gives workshops to train people to internalize and use strategies based on the principles of rationality on a more regular basis to improve their reasoning and decision making skills and achieve goals. She was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry in 2015. Popularization of rationality research In 2009, Galef began co-hosting the Rationally Speaking Podcast with the philosopher of science Massimo Pigliucci. Their first episode was released on February 1, 2010. The show has hosted conversations with public intellectuals such as Neil deGrasse Tyson, Lawrence Krauss, James Randi, and Peter Singer. Galef frequently speaks on rationality and moderates debates at skeptic conferences. She gives public lectures to organizations including the Center for Inquiry and the Secular Student Alliance. From 2010 to 2015, she was a speaker for the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism. Galef at Het Denkgelag 2015 moderating a conversation between Dawkins and Krauss. Galef began writing the blog Measure of Doubt in 2011 with her brother, as well as writing for Religion Dispatches Archived from religiondispatches.org/contributors/juliagalef/ and Scientific American. Archived from scientificamerican.com/author.cfm?id=3125 Since April 2015 she has been the sole host of the Rationally Speaking podcast. Galef's activities as a writer, podcaster and president of the Center for Applied Rationality are mentioned by The Atlantic, The Verge, and NPR. In 2014, she wrote several articles and recorded several short videos for Big Think, some of which are part of the Big Think Mentor's workshops. Subsequent to her exposure with Big Think as an expert on the topic of rationality, she was interviewed in 2014 by Forbes, Fast Company, and The Wall Street Journal. In particular her idea of keeping a \\"surprise journal\\" received attention, which is one of the techniques Galef uses to record incidents where her expectations were wrong, in order to recognize personal faulty assumptions that expose and counterweight the \\"bias blind spot\\". According to Galef, it can be easier to adjust internalized beliefs by framing the new evidence as a surprise. In February 2016, Galef delivered a TED talk on, \\"Why you think you're right — even if you're wrong\\", encouraging critical self-skepticism and prioritizing coming to the correct viewpoint using \\"scout mindset\\" instead of working to ensure your current viewpoint is seen as correct with a \\"soldier mindset\\". The talk was covered by National Public Radio's TED Radio Hour in November 2016.  Ideas on rationality  Julia Galef often explains common confusions and popular misconceptions of rationality. Frequently she distinguishes between Richard Foley'sFoley, R. (2014). The Theory of Epistemic Rationality. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 6-8. Retrieved 16 Sep. 2019, from https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/249159 concept of \\"epistemic rationality\\" from Max Weber's \\"instrumental rationality\\". She describes epistemic rationality as a way of reasoning according to logic and the principles of probability theory to form beliefs and conclusions. In contrast, she describes instrumental rationality as a decision-making process in which people choose the action that maximizes their expected utility, whatever their goals are. Galef popularized the concept of Straw Vulcan, originally coined by the website TV Tropes,, to describe the incorrect perception about rationality as a way of thinking that denies emotions such as love and lacks appreciations for beauty. It refers to the fictional character Spock (a half-Vulcan) in Star Trek, who is often seen as a poster child for this caricature of rationality. Galef argues that, given the gross irrationality Spock has seen in humans, his failure to adjust his expectations about humans' ability to make rational decisions is itself a case of irrationality. In 2011, Galef gave a talk on this subject at Skepticon.

Gary Usher, who produced their debut album, The Peanut Butter Conspiracy Is Spreading, was again the producer for this album. It was the last time the group released new material with Columbia as their contractual obligations were met. Their second album is regarded as the best of the group's outputs for its solidified sound in psychedelic music. Background Recording sessions took place in Los Angeles, and New York City in the latter half of 1967 after the band completed touring for their debut album. Their 1967 national tour had the PBC opening in high-profile venues including the Fillmore Auditorium, and the Whisky a Go-Go for contemporaries like Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane. The band was influenced by those they opened for and it was reflected on their album. For recording, the band added guitarist Bill Wolff previously from the band, Sound Machine. The second recording by the PBC emphasized a reflection of their live performances compared to their pop-driven début album. Eight of the eleven tracks extend beyond the three-minute limit conventional for songs of the period. These extended jams, most notably \\"Too Many Do\\" and \\"Ecstasy\\", most resemble the live experience of a PBC performance. \\"Too Many Do\\" became one of the first long cut recordings to be featured in extended radio play. Alan Brackett, regarding their extended tracks, said it was \\"something we enjoyed a lot and I wish we had done it more at the recording sessions\\". Many of the tracks include complex instrumental sections. Instrumentally, their sound was more experimental as the band included additional sound effects and distorted guitar solos, signatured by the chord stops and starts. Barbara Robison was limited to backing vocals on several tracks, and shared the singing duty with Al Brackett. However, when Robison did perform lead vocals, like on the track \\"Pleasure\\", she displayed a powerful voice with emotional integrity. Overall, the band's sound was more focused as they were allowed recording freedom. Release The band released the album in December 1967 on the Columbia label. The Great Conspiracy charted in the lower 90s of the Los Angeles pop charts. Two singles, \\"Turn on a Friend\\" b/w \\"Captain Sandwich\\" and \\"I'm a Fool\\" b/w \\"It's So Hard\\" did not reach the top 100 in the national charts. Their single \\"I'm a Fool\\" proved to be the most successful of the tracks when it reached number 125 on the Bubbling Under portion of the Billboard Charts, thanks to extensive west coast radio play. \\"I'm A Fool\\" and \\"It's So Hard\\" did not appear on the original release of the album, but were included in subsequent releases. These tracks did not coincide with the psychedelic style of the album as they were more blues originated. Columbia Records did not re- sign the band after their contract expired, and they signed to Challenge Records. CBS Records released The Rock Machine Turns You On, the first budget sampler LP, in the UK in 1968. The song \\"Turn on a Friend\\" was included as the sixth track on the sampler and introduced PBC to a much wider audience. On February 8, 2000, The Great Conspiracy was released in a double album along with the group's first album on the Collectables label. It included the tracks \\"I'm A Fool\\", \\"It's So Hard\\" and the previously unreleased track, \\"Peter Pan\\". The \\"Peter Pan\\" track was recorded in one take during sessions for The Great Conspiracy, but subsequently was not released until the 2000 double album release.

Nominated by SYRIZA, he was sworn in as a member of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in January 2015. Early life and career Kotzias studied Economics (Diploma) and Political Science and Philosophy (MA) in Athens and Law and Politics of European Integration (PhD and Post-doc) at the University of Giessen in Germany. According to his online biography worked as a researcher and taught at the Universities of Marburg, Oxford and Cambridge and he holds from 2008 on the position of Professor of Political Theories and International and European Studies at the University of Piraeus. He has specialized in issues of policy and political systems, societies and foreign policy of Brazil, India and Russia. He has been a member of many globally recognized international research teams on contemporary issues. In addition to numerous other publications, he wrote 24 scientific books, published the German philosopher in the tradition of critical theory Jürgen Habermas in Greece and also released a collection of poems . Political career Kotzias was active as a student in the Lambrakis Democratic Youth and during the right-wing military dictatorship in Greece was a member of the Communist Youth of Greece. He was a secretary of the Federation of Greek Fraternities in Germany as well as the coordination point of the anti-dictatorship student organizations. Later he was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Greece and was repeatedly condemned by military courts. During his years in the Greek Communist Party, he became the party's ideological instructor. He was often praised for his masterful rhetoric and his profound knowledge of Marxist philosophy. During the 1980s, he praised the Polish government's crackdown on the Solidarity movement. Kotzias broke with the Communist Party after the majority's decision to co-ally with the conservatives in order to bring Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to trial for corruption. Along with other party members, he characterized that decision as an \\"unholy alliance\\" and declared their resignation which subsequently led to the creation of a new leftist group. He is a founding member of Nikos Poulantzas leftist think tank, which was named after a Franco-Greek, Marxist oriented sociologist and political philosopher. From 1993 to 2008, he was in the diplomatic service in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the rank of ambassador beginning in 2005. As a chief diplomat, he was involved in negotiations on the Amsterdam Treaty, Agenda 2000, the Greek-Turkish relations and the European Constitution. Kotzias played an important role during the \\"spring\\" of the Greek-Turkish relations in 1999, implementing the \\"earthquake diplomacy\\" at the time when the two countries were struck by catastrophic earthquakes. He has supported the Greek-Turkish rapprochement as a new policy doctrine and introduced the confidence-building measures (CBMs). He was also the Greek representative in the 2002 Helsinki agreement which regulated Turkey's candidacy status for EU membership and paved the way for Cyprus' accession in 2004. In September 2012, Kotzias founded the progressive and democratic political movement named Pratto, whose purpose is \\"to form a radical, patriotic, democratic and social movement, advocating the interests of the country, the Greek people, the workers and the Greek natural environment\\". Current Minister of Public Order and Citizen Protection and MP Nikos Toskas is also a founding member of Pratto. In one of his interviews in Spiegel Online on 9 February 2015 he noted that he is an atheist. He speaks Greek, German as native and fluent English. Since January 2015 Kotzias is Foreign Minister in a cabinet in coalition with Independent Greeks, a right wing conservative party that also opposes austerity. =Foreign policy views= Nikos Kotzias is an advocate of a multidimensional, energetic and democratic attitude towards foreign policy. He supports the view that even a relatively small state, in terms of economic power, can take advantage of the changes that occur in a global context and increase its capacities to allow it to exercise an autonomous foreign policy according to the national interest. Supporting the view that the world has already begun to move towards multipolarity, Kotzias believes that states that wish to increase their influence and capacities should seek to forge concrete relations with the emerging powers (BRICS). =\\"Debt colony\\" theory= In one of his latest books \\"The Colony of Debt\\", Nikos Kotzias claims that the European Union is developing empire characteristics, as it perceives markets, the bureaucracy in Brussels and Germany as focal elements of its structure. In this way, he argues, the EU is rendering in a two-tier region of a rich North and poor South. =Minister of Foreign Affairs= Nikos Kotzias with Foreign Minister of Cyprus Ioannis Kasoulidis Ministerial handover to Kotzias, January 2015 On 27 January 2015, Nikos Kotzias was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs, despite not being a member of parliament. During the ceremony of the handing of the ministry, Kotzias gave a notion of his political approach stating: \\"We look forward to bridges with the new emerging world. We do not see our membership in European institutions as conflictual to our relations with emerging powers.\\" In the same night of Kotzias's appointment, the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement, issuing Greece's unwillingness to agree to key passage of statement, delaying agreement for further EU sanctions against Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine, before the extraordinary meeting of the EU Council of Foreign Ministers, which was scheduled on 29 January 2015 in Brussels. The new minister argued that \\"certain of our partners attempted to present us with a fait accomplis before the new government had even been sworn\\". He also underlined that Greece \\"would not relinquish its sovereignty and active contribution to European policy as this would be an act that circumvents a vital principle of Europeanism.\\" The 29 January meeting resulted to an improved and softened version of the statement, extending the ongoing sanctions but avoiding to include further measures, mainly due to the position that the Greek minister held. Federica Mogherini, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, stated that Kotzias's \\"attitude was extremely constructive\\" during the meeting and that \\"this was an extremely positive exercise\\" which led to \\"a consensual and substantial decision.\\" = Second term as Minister of Foreign Affairs and resignation = Kotzias with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, 13 March 2017 After the announcement for early legislative elections on 20 September 2015, Nikos Kotzias was nominated as a candidate on SYRIZA national ballots after the agreement of Pratto to co-ally with SYRIZA, and he was elected as a member of the Greek Parliament. On 23 September 2015, after the formation of a coalition government between SYRIZA and Independent Greeks, Kotzias was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs for a second time, succeeding the caretaker minister Petros Molyviatis. On 17 October 2018 Kotzias submitted his resignation, a day after a cabinet meeting during which he clashed over the Prespa agreement with Defense Minister Panos Kammenos, who has opposed the deal. He was succeeded by then PM Alexis Tsipras. Selected books and articles * Poland and Ourselves. Synchroni Epochi (1981) * Globalization, The historical place and the future.

Flammable nitrate film had previously contributed to several fires in film industry laboratories, studios, and vaults; although the precise causes were often unknown. In Little Ferry, gases produced by decaying film, combined with high temperatures and inadequate ventilation, resulted in spontaneous combustion. One death and two injuries resulted from the fire, which also destroyed all the archived film in the vaults, resulting in the loss of most of the silent films produced by the Fox Film Corporation before 1932. Also destroyed were negatives from Educational Pictures (with which Fox was then affiliated) and films of several other studios. The fire brought attention to the potential for decaying nitrate film to spontaneously ignite, and changed the focus of film preservation efforts to include a greater focus on fire safety. Background =Nitrate film= The early motion-picture industry primarily used film stock made of nitrocellulose, commonly called nitrate film. This film is flammable, and produces its own oxygen supply as it burns. Nitrate fires burn rapidly and cannot be extinguished, as they are capable of burning even under water. Nitrocellulose is also subject to thermal decomposition and hydrolysis, breaking down over time in the presence of high temperatures and moisture. This decaying film stock releases nitrogen oxides that themselves contribute to the decay and make the damaged film burn more easily. Under the right conditions, nitrate film can even spontaneously combust. In part because of substantial variability in the manufacturing of early film, considerable uncertainty exists about the circumstances necessary for self-ignition. Sustained temperatures of or higher, large quantities of nitrate film, increased humidity, poor ventilation, and aged or decaying film have all been considered risk factors. Most such fires in film archives have taken place in heat waves during summer months, in closed facilities with limited ventilation, compounding several of these variables. Especially in confined areas, such fires can result in explosions. Large and dangerous fires sometimes resulted. On May 4, 1897, one of the first major fires involving nitrate film began when a Lumière projector caught fire at the Bazar de la Charité in Paris. The resulting blaze caused 126 deaths. In the United States, a series of fires occurred at industry facilities. The Lubin Manufacturing Company's vault in Philadelphia exploded on June 13, 1914, followed on December 9 by a fire that destroyed Thomas Edison's laboratory complex in West Orange, New Jersey. The New York studio of the Famous Players Film Company burned in September 1915; in July 1920, the shipping facility of its corporate successor, Famous Players-Lasky, was destroyed by a fire in Kansas City, Missouri, despite construction intended to minimize that risk. The United Film Ad Service vault, also in Kansas City, burned on August 4, 1928, and a fire was reported at Pathé Exchange nine days later. In October 1929, the Consolidated Film Industries facility was badly damaged by a nitrate fire. Spontaneous combustion was not proven to have occurred in any of these fires, and may not have been recognized as possible before a 1933 study determined that the temperatures necessary for nitrate film to self-ignite had been overestimated. =Little Ferry= In the earlier 20th century nearby Fort Lee on the Hudson Palisades was home to many film studios of America's first motion picture industry. When Little Ferry, New Jersey, contractor William Fehrs was hired to construct a film storage facility in 1934, he designed the structure to be fireproof. The building had brick outer walls and a reinforced concrete roof. Internally, it was divided into 48 individual vaults, each enclosed behind a steel door and separated by brick interior walls. The local fire department confirmed Fehrs's fireproofing. However, it had neither a fire sprinkler system nor mechanical ventilation, and no security guard was employed to watch the facility. Despite the potential fire danger of stored film, the building was located in a residential neighborhood. Film processing company DeLuxe Laboratories owned the building and rented it to 20th Century- Fox to store the silent films acquired from Fox Film Corporation after its merger with Twentieth Century Pictures. Fire alt=Film footage of a building on fire and firemen attempting to extinguish it Northern New Jersey experienced a heat wave in July 1937, with daytime temperatures of and warm nights. The sustained heat contributed to nitrate decomposition in the film vaults, and the building's ventilation was inadequate to prevent a dangerous buildup of gases. At some time shortly after 2:00a.m. on July 9, spontaneous ignition occurred in the vault at the building's northwest corner. Local truck driver Robert Davison observed flames coming from one of the structure's window vents, and within five minutes, used a municipal fire alarm call box to report the fire. Davison then attempted to awaken the residents of the surrounding houses, many of whom were already alerted to the situation by the noise and intense heat. As the contents of additional vaults ignited, bursts of flame shot out horizontally across the ground from the windows, and a similar distance into the air from the building's roof vents. When the fire spread to the vaults in the south and east of the building, they exploded, damaging the brickwork and blowing out window frames. Anna Greeves and her two sons, John and Charles, were caught in a \\"sheet of flame\\" while attempting to flee the area. All three were seriously burned; 13-year-old Charles eventually died from his injuries on July 19. Other families were able to escape unharmed as the fire spread to five neighboring residences and destroyed two vehicles. Little Ferry firefighters first arrived at 2:26, followed by companies from Hawthorne, Ridgefield Park, River Edge, and South Hackensack. It took 150 men employing 14 hose streams to put the fire out by 5:30. All the film in the facility was destroyed; more than 40,000 reels of negatives and prints burned to ashes inside their film cans. The building was also badly damaged. Exploding vaults had destroyed segments of both the exterior walls and interior partitions and had deformed the structure's concrete roof. Total property damage was estimated at $150,000–200,000. Fifty-seven truckloads of burned film were hauled from the site to have their silver content extracted. Each can contained about five cents' worth of silver; the salvaged metal returned $2,000. Legacy Damage to 361 Main Street, the residence closest to the vaults Although 20th Century-Fox officials at the time remarked that \\"only old films\\" were destroyed, the fire is now understood as a significant loss of American film heritage. Motion picture historian Anthony Slide called the destruction of the Fox vault \\"the most tragic\\" American nitrate fire. The highest-quality examples of every Fox film produced prior to 1932 were destroyed; all known copies of many movies had been stored in the facility. Films lost to the fire include pictures starring Theda Bara, Shirley Mason, William Farnum, and many others. Tom Mix made eighty-five pictures with Fox, most of which were archived exclusively at Little Ferry. The grandfather of director Blake Edwards, J. Gordon Edwards, had directed all the highest grossing epics for Fox and all the masters for his films were lost (though a few survive as low quality prints which were housed elsewhere). For some actors, such as Valeska Suratt, none of their films survive; \\"there are entire careers that don't exist because of [the fire],\\" according to Museum of Modern Art film curator Dave Kehr. Because some copies were located elsewhere, some of Fox's silent films survive as lower-quality printsor fragmentsbut more than 75% of Fox's feature films from before 1930 are completely lost. The Little Ferry vaults also held works by other film studios that had contracted with Fox for distribution. Educational Pictures lost more than two thousand silent negatives and prints; the company's sound films survived. Also present was the original negative of D. W. Griffith's Way Down East (which Fox had purchased with the intent of remaking), the negative for the controversial Christie Productions sponsored film The Birth of a Baby and films produced by Sol Lesser under his imprints Atherton Productions, Peck's Bad Boy Corporation, and Principal Pictures. Archival material intended for the Museum of Modern Art's Film Library was lost as well. alt=refer to article text The destruction of the Little Ferry facility spurred an interest in fire safety as an aspect of film preservation. Unlike previous large nitrate-film fires, investigators determined that the spontaneous combustion of decomposing film stock was responsible. They suggested that the older nitrocellulose film in the archive was of lower quality than their current film, and thus more unstable. The Society of Motion Picture Engineers' Committee on Preservation of Film, three months after the vault fire, cited \\"recent and rather extensive film fires\\" as evidence that existing preservation efforts had failed to adequately address the risk of fire. More heavily reinforced film vaults were suggested, to prevent fires in a single vault from destroying entire archival facilities. Film storage cabinets with ventilation and cooling systems were also proposed, as was further research into improving the quality of cellulose acetate film to encourage its use as a safer replacement for nitrate film. By the 1950s, the use of nitrate film in the United States had been essentially eliminated.

Through his celebrated technique of juxtaposing and layering archive footage with text, music and photographs, Akomfrah crosses the memory landscape of Stuart Hall, Jamaican-born founder of British Cultural Studies, to reflect on the nature and complexities of memory and identity. The Unfinished Conversation was commissioned by Autograph ABP.\\"Exhibitions/Commissions John Akomfrah: The Unfinished Conversation\\", Autograph ABP. It opened at Tate Britain, London, on 26 October 2013, following its premiere at Bluecoat during the 2012 Liverpool Biennial.\\"John Akomfrah’s film installation ‘The Unfinished Conversation’ opens at the Tate Britain\\", ARC Magazine, 25 October 2013.  Summary  The Unfinished Conversation is a journey through theorist Stuart Hall's work and output on radio and television as a post-war immigrant who arrived in England in the first quarter of the 1950s and pioneered in British cultural studies, as the co-founder of the movement together with E. P. Thompson and Raymond Williams of the journal New Left Review. Director John Akomfrah, alongside his fellow Black Audio Film Collective members, was engaged with Hall's academic project since the 1970s due to his appearance in the BBC programme It Ain’t Half Racist, Mum. Consequently, The Unfinished Conversation is a personal project for the director reflecting on his own passage and research on archive-based work related to the notion of black identity.  The commission  Akomfrah's project The Unfinished Conversation started as an application to the Arts Council initiated by Mark Sealy, Director of Autograph ABP and executive producer of the project, based on the premise of commissioning a collaboration between Akomfrah and academic Stuart Hall about the notion of visual and black identity. However, the extensive availability of archive material featuring Hall on radio, cinema and television suggested a parallel project, the making of Akomfrah's documentary The Stuart Hall Project. In an interview with writer-curator Georgia Korossi, Akomfrah explains: \\"I started to play around with the idea of seeing The Unfinished Conversation as our take on Hall's legacy and implications, and The Stuart Hall Project being pretty much his take on us, and the outside world.\\" The project was made possible by Autograph ABP's commission, with the aim to bring visibility to photographic histories and practices that have often been overlooked.  The project  The acclaimed three-screen installation, The Unfinished Conversation, was developed through the study and selection from 800 hours of Stuart Hall's own archive material of audio interviews and television recordings. With reference to identity, race and memory, The Unfinished Conversation re-imagines the nature of memory itself through an individual's personal archive, marked with the music of Miles Davis, one of Hall's much loved musicians, as Hall's remarkable archive triggers the world events that were unfolding. Akomfrah's multi-layered installation celebrates Hall's groundbreaking work on culture and identity that is still relevant today. It also examines the questionable nature of the visual that reflects on Hall's work in media studies; with reference to Hall's own position in the world, growing up in Jamaica as part of the Caribbean diaspora, it tackles his central idea that identity, ethnic, cultural or sexual, is fluid and open to recreation.

Biography  Areski grew up in Versailles, where his parents, of kabyle (Berber) descent, were welcoming Algerian musicians: \\"at my house, post-war stars, old chaâbi veterans, were coming to play at my parents' home.\\"mondomix.com, 26.10.2010 As an adolescent, he watched rehearsals, for Olympia concerts, by Édith Piaf, The Beatles or Jacques Brel, in the great room of the Cyrano cinema. He began in dancing clubs, second-rate restaurants, and then went on to play at weddings, playing popular hits, and began performing on stage thanks to catholic sponsorship. Before his military service, during which he became friends with Jacques Higelin, he was playing in Saint-Germain-des-Prés caves as a drummer for jam sessions; after his military service, he started touring France as a multi-instrumentalist in various rock and jazz clubs. Belkacem recorded an album with Higelin in 1969 and his voice is heard in the song Remember, of which he composed the music. Higelin introduced him to Brigitte Fontaine, and as early as 1969, they created Niok, a mostly improvised show which remained for months at the Lucernaire theatre in Paris. At the Théâtre du Vieux- Colombier, that same year, he played with Fontaine and the Art Ensemble of Chicago on the Comme à la radio album, which would go on to be an underground classic. He then recorded his first solo album in 1970, Un beau matin, and was the protagonist of the movie Ça va, ça vient, by Pierre Barouh, founder of the Saravah label. At the same time, he composed music for the director Peter Brook and also contributed to his shows as a comedian in the International Centre for Theatre Research. His sentimental relationship with Brigitte Fontaine began after the album Brigitte Fontaine (1972), during the production of Je ne connais pas cet homme. In the 1970s, the shows of the duo Areski- Fontaine, often played in difficult conditions, mixed theatre and music, included much improvisation and few instruments or props, a unique mix of Areski's music (who also wrote some lyrics) with African and European traditional influences, and the lyrics of Fontaine. They shared lead singing on several albums (Je ne connais pas cet homme, L'Incendie, Le Bonheur, Vous et Nous, Les églantines sont peut-être formidables) produced under various situations, sometimes with little resources, exploring new ground, including some in which they are precursors (spoken poetry on Comme à la radio, electronics on Vous et Nous). Their influences range from Renaissance music to psychedelia with lyrics tackling legends, social commentary and biography. The 80s were a more difficult period, which saw the creation of Acte 2, a Brigitte Fontaine show which he performed with her. The album French corazon and the low-profile hit Le Nougat helped both of them to come back in 1992. Since then, Areski is still Brigitte Fontaine's main composer and sometimes sings duets with her on her albums, performs background vocals and does the arrangements. His work has evolved toward more contemporaneous sounds but still includes more classical influences. Named \\"Prince consort of French chanson\\" by Camille Couteau in the newspaper Le Saule in January 2011 or compared to Berlioz by Éric Loret (\\"If Gainsbourg was Chopin\\", Libération, May 2010), Areski has also collaborated with Barbara, Georges Moustaki or Sapho. With her, he contributed to the Voix de la Méditerranée festival in Lodève. He also worked with Jean-Claude Vannier and Jean-Efflam Bavouzet, Antoine Duhamel, Sonic Youth, Richard Galliano, Christophe and Grace Jones. He is considered one of the most prestigious French composers. Both Comme à la radio and Les Palaces received the Académie Charles Cros award. In parallel to his activities in chanson, Areski has also made soundtracks with his son Ali Belkacem for films (notably Jeunesse dorée in 2001 and À mort la mort by Romain Goupil in 1999) and theatre (Une liaison transatlantique). In 2004, he went studying at the Schola Cantorum de Paris to learn more about classical music. With Zep and Benoît Mouchart, he created in 2005 the music for an innovative show, the Concert de dessins which is now featured every year at the Angoulême International Comics Festival and allows the creation in music on big screen of an original comic. On 26 October 2010, he published his second solo album, Le Triomphe de l'amour. The next year, he sang a duet with Zaza Fournier at the Olympia. In 2012, he played with Benoît Poelvoorde and Albert Dupontel in Le Grand Soir. In May 2013, he contributed to the show Il n'y a plus rien mais on est là by Mounia Raoui alongside Ali Belkacem and Bobby Jocky at the Gérard Philipe theatre.

Taiaroa is monotypic in the family Taiaroidae and contains a single species, Taiaroa tauhou. The species was first described by the marine zoologists Frederick M. Bayer and Katherine Margaret Muzik in 1976. The scientific name derives from \\"Taiaroa\\", the submarine canyon off New Zealand in which the first specimens were found and \\"tauhou\\", the Maori word for \\"strange\\". Taxonomy In 1973, a new species of solitary octocoral was dredged from the seabed off the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand, at a depth of . At first it was believed to be a species of burrowing sea anemone and it was given to marine biologist Dr. Cadet Hand for examination. He quickly realised it was an octocoral and sought the assistance of marine biologist Dr Frederick Bayer, who gave it the name Taiaroa tauhou. In 1976, the suborder Protoalcyonaria was re-established to accommodate it and further specimens which had been discovered. This higher-level taxon had been erected by Sydney Hickson in 1894 for non-colonial octocorals. However, there was doubt whether these were really solitary, or whether they were just the young forms of colonial species, and it became redundant when the genera included in it were all transferred to other taxa. Description Taiaroa tauhou has a tall, cylindrical body held in place in soft substrate by numerous filaments attached to the base. The anthocodia, the upper part of the polyp bearing the eight pinnate tentacles and the mouth, can be fully retracted back into the anthostele, the rigid, lower part of the polyp. The anthostele is strengthened by spindle-shaped calcareous sclerites and has eight longitudinal ridges. It comprises more than half of the polyp's length. The largest individual examined had a total length of and a maximum diameter of . The retractible anthocodia measured . The body wall is opaque and beige in colour. The filaments securing the polyp to the substrate are encrusted with sediment. Biology Taiaroa tauhou is a solitary coral that reproduces solely by means of sexual reproduction. It may be a hermaphrodite, as one individual examined contained both eggs and spermaries (sperm producing organs), but other individuals only contained eggs or were exclusively male. It is unclear whether the gonads in the bisexual individual were attached to the body wall. It may be that the males liberate spermaries which are ingested by the females, resulting in internal fertilisation, and this would mean that the animals are not hermaphroditic.

Aaronson, was a British poet and a lecturer in economics. As a young man, he belonged to a group of Jewish friends who are today known as the Whitechapel Boys, many of whom later achieved fame as writers and artists. Though less radical in his use of language, he has been compared to his more renowned Whitechapel friend, Isaac Rosenberg, in terms of diction and verbal energy. Aaronson's poetry is characterised more as 'post-Georgian' than modernistic, and reviewers have since been able to trace influences back to both the English poet John Keats, and Hebrew poets such as Shaul Tchernichovsky and Zalman Shneur. Aaronson lived most of his life in London and spent much of his working life as a lecturer in economics at the City of London College. In his twenties, he converted to Christianity and a large part of his poetry focused on his conversion and spiritual identity as a Jew and an Englishman. In total, he published three collections of poetry: Christ in the Synagogue (1930), Poems (1933), and The Homeward Journey and Other Poems (1946). Although he did not achieve widespread recognition, Aaronson gained a cult following of dedicated readers. Upon retiring from teaching, he moved to Harpenden, Hertfordshire, where he died from heart failure and coronary heart disease on 9 December 1966. His poetry was not widely publicised, and he left many unpublished poems at his death. Life and career Aaronson was born on the 24th of December 1894 at 34 Great Pearl Street, Spitalfields in the East End of London to poor Orthodox Jewish parents who had immigrated from Vilna in the Pale of Settlement in Eastern Europe. His father was Louis Aaronson, a bootmaker, and his mother was Sarah Aaronson, née Kowalski. He attended Whitechapel City Boys' School and later received a scholarship to attend Hackney Downs Grammar School. His father emigrated to New York in 1905. The rest of the family followed in 1912, except for 17-year old Lazarus who remained in London. From then on, he lived with the family of Joseph Posener at 292 Commercial Road in the East End of London. At the time, the area was a hub of the Jewish diaspora and at the turn of the 20th century, a quarter of its population were Jews from Central and Eastern Europe. Growing up in the East End, Aaronson was part of a group of friends who are today referred to as the Whitechapel Boys, all of whom were children of Jewish immigrants and shared literary and artistic ambitions. Others in the group who, like Aaronson, later achieved distinction included John Rodker, Isaac Rosenberg, Joseph Leftwich, Stephen Winsten, Clara Birnberg, David Bomberg, and the brothers Abraham Fineberg and Joseph Fineberg. Aaronson was also involved in the Young Socialist League, where he and other Whitechapel Boys helped organise educational meetings on modern art and radical politics. Aaronson remained a committed socialist throughout adulthood. Having been diagnosed with tuberculosis and diabetes, Aaronson did not serve in the military during the First World War. Between 1913 and 1915, and again between 1926 and 1928, he studied economics with a special focus on public administration at the London School of Economics, but never completed his degree.Baker, William; Roberts Shumaker, Jeanette (2017). \\"Pioneers: E. O. Deutsch, B. L. Farjeon, Israel Gollancz, Leonard Merrick, and Lazarus Aaronson\\". The Literature of the Fox: A Reference and Critical Guide to Jewish Writing in the UK. AMS Studies in Modern Literature. AMS Press. pp. 21–30. . Aaronson was married three times. His first wife was the actress Lydia Sherwood (1906–1989), whom he was married to between 1924 and 1931. He filed for divorce on grounds of her adultery with the theatre producer Theodore Komisarjevsky, and the much publicised suit was undefended. His second marriage, which took place on 9 July 1938, to Dorothy Beatrice Lewer (1915–2005), also ended in divorce. On 14 January 1950, Aaronson married Margaret Olive Ireson (1920–1981), with whom he had one son, David, who was born in 1953. To friends and family, Lazarus Aaronson was known as Laz. He was friends with the novelist Stephen Hudson, the sculptor Jacob Epstein, the media mogul Sidney Bernstein, the artists Mark Gertler and Matthew Smith and the poets Harold Monro, Louis MacNeice and Samuel Beckett. Aaronson was also close to the economist Graham Hutton, who in 1952 made a radio programme about him for the BBC. Around 1934, he began working as a lecturer in economics at the City of London College. Upon his retirement from the university in 1958, Aaronson was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 New Year Honours, in recognition of more than twenty-five years of service. The same year he moved with his family from London to Harpenden in Hertfordshire, where he later died from coronary heart disease and heart failure on 9 December 1966, at the age of 71. He was buried in the Westfield Road Cemetery in Harpenden. His wife and young son survived him. Poetry Aaronson had literary ambitions from an early age, and by 1914 he contributed his first work for the radical literary magazine The New Age. He was often published under the name L. Aaronson. In the 1920s, he converted to Christianity. His first collection of poems, Christ in the Synagogue, published by V. Gollancz in 1930, dealt to a large extent with his conversion and spiritual identity as both a Jew and an Englishman. This subject would become a recurring theme in his numerous mystical poems. Christ in the Synagogue reached only a small audience and received fewer than a dozen reviews, but The Manchester Guardian, The Nation and Athenaeum, The Times Literary Supplement, and The New Age wrote favourably of it.Extracts of the reviews are reprinted in Notwithstanding Aaronson's small readership, V. Gollancz published a second verse collection in 1933, titled Poems. Despite being little known to the general public, Aaronson gained a cult following of dedicated readers. His third collection, The Homeward Journey and Other Poems, was published in 1946 by Christophers, a small London publisher. Some of his works also appeared in journals and anthologies such as the 1953 Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse. Since Aaronson's poetry does not display formal innovation, literature professor William Baker, characterises him as \\"A post- Georgian rather than a modernist [poet]\\". Baker further notes that Aaronson's poetry deals with several issues of his time, such as the rise of fascism and the Second World War, but points out that Aaronson did not directly write about the Holocaust. Upon Aaronson's death, the poet Arthur Chaim Jacobs compared him with Isaac Rosenberg, the more celebrated poet of the same Anglo- Jewish generation. According to Jacobs, Aaronson was \\"clearly influenced by him in terms of diction, and in a kind of verbal energy which runs through a lot of his poetry. But he was less radical than Rosenberg in his use of language, and tended towards Keatsian luxuriance and sweetness.\\" The poet Jon Silkin also unfavourably compared Aaronson to Rosenberg, writing \\"it cannot be said that his work attains to either the burning majesty or the depth of Rosenberg's poetry, and this is explicable perhaps by the fact that Aaronson does not altogether care to acknowledge his roots.\\" Although much of Aaronson's writings centred on his conversion to Christianity, Jacobs traces a continuing Hebraic mood in his poetry, and wrote that \\"his Christianity was hardly familiarly Anglican, and there is in his work an avowed sensuality which could in some ways be compared to that of modern Hebrew poets like Tchernikowsky or Shneur, or later, Avraham Shlonsky.\\" According to his friend Joseph Leftwich, Aronson himself in old age acknowledged influences from both traditional Judaism and Martin Buber's unorthodox interpretation of Hasidism. Aaronson's poetry was not widely publicised, and he left over a thousand unpublished poems at his death. Little scholarly attention has been paid to his life and poetry. Upon Aaronson's death Jacobs stated that \\"Further assessment of his work awaits more substantial publication\\"; about 40 years later, Baker, who has written most extensively on Aaronson, named him among the Whitechapel intellectual writers and artists \\"today consigned to oblivion\\".

History Following the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, the Luftwaffe secured Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik and Sola Air Station, the two land airports along the south coast of Norway. The Luftwaffe quickly assessed that there would be need for an additional airfield located between Kristiansand and Stavanger.

However, by Mandal's completion the Luftwaffe had concluded that Lista would be a more suitable site for a major air base. Planning started in August 1940 and Mandal remained in use until April 1941. It was then closed down and operations moved to Lista Air Station. A further expansion of Mandal took place in 1944, with more taxiways and aircraft stands, although these were never used. No squadrons were ever stationed at Mandal and it was closed at the end of the war in 1945. Civilian interest in the airfield arose in 1950.

The first wave of migrants were individuals who opened stores, restaurants, and private medical clinics. Chinese run stores in Kinshasa are typically scattered across neighborhoods and are not concentrated in any Chinatown. The stores carry a range of household goods and change money. The owner eekes out a small profit albeit one still higher than what is earned by neighborhood stores in China. Some small scale entrepreneurs are in mining. In Katanga Province 60 of the 75 mineral processing plants are owned by Chinese entrepreneurs. Chinese employers have been criticized for their use of child labor and lack of health and safety standards. Major deals have been signed by Chinese state owned companies and the DRC government. In 2012, Chinese investors and the Export- Import Bank of China offered to build $6 billion worth of infrastructure as part of a loan backed by collateral in mineral rights. These state owned enterprises have brought Chinese employees to the country. Anti-Chinese violence Congolese mobs have attacked Chinese businesses on at least two occasions. In December 2010, local team TP Mazembe lost to Italian club Inter Milan. Mobs in Lubumbashi were angered by the calls made by a Japanese referee who was mistaken for Chinese, provoking attacks on Chinese businesses in the city. During protests in January 2015 against the government of Joseph Kabila, Chinese businesses in the Kinshasa neighborhoods of Ngaba and Kalamu were targeted for destruction. An Agence France-Presse article on the attacks reported the motivation for violence was both resentment by local businesses that had difficulty competing against the low prices of Chinese run stores and association by rioters of Chinese nationals running stores with investment deals concluded by Chinese companies and the government.

She was mayor of the borough of York, Ontario from 1978 to 1982. Background Christie was born in Garson, Ontario just outside of Sudbury. Her parents were John and Muriel Ingle. Her father owned a Toronto insurance company. She attended Runnymede Collegiate Institute. She married John Christie with whom she had four children. Politics Christie was elected as a school trustee in 1972. She served until 1976 when she was elected alderman in ward 7 in the borough of York, Ontario. In the 1978 municipal election she ran for the position of mayor and defeated incumbent Philip White by 1,682 votes. Defeated mayor White commented on her victory. He said, \\"Christie had a well-oiled election machine. They had the troops. That's what you need and I didn't have them.\\" She was re-elected in 1980. In 1982, she was narrowly defeated by Alan Tonks by a margin of 105 votes. Christie had been criticized during the campaign for her handling of labour negotiations which led to a garbage strike and a work slowdown by civic employees. While recounts were only done for margins under 100 votes, Christie pressed for a recount nonetheless. In a negotiation between Tonks and Christie, they were both allowed to open the ballot boxes to scrutinize the contents. While Christie hinted at forcing a new election, she eventually relinquished the mayor's chair to Tonks. In 1984, she attempted to become nominated as the federal Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of Eglinton-Lawrence. She was defeated by Dan La Caprara after three ballots by a vote of 410 to 317. De Caprara lost to incumbent Roland de Corneille in the June election. In 1985, she tried for another nomination, this time as the provincial PC candidate in the riding of Eglinton. She lost to David McFadden who went on to win the riding in the May election. After politics In 1985, she was appointed as a director to the board of Air Canada by Brian Mulroney. Christie was a long-time friend of Mulroney's and worked as co-chair of his leadership campaign in 1984. The appointment was widely seen as a patronage appointment. After the appointment, Christie jokingly referred to her driver's licence as a qualification for her appointment. The humour did not go over well with Mulroney's aides. In the 1990s, she started working as a government relations consultant and lobbyist. In 2004, she became president of the Yorktown Child and Family Centre.

She has exhibited photographs and films across Australia and also internationally, focusing on politics and exposing the disparagement around Indigenous Australian cultures. She is credited with introducing the term \\"Blak\\" to refer to Indigenous Australians' contemporary art, culture and history. Early life Deacon was born in 1957 in Maryborough, Queensland, of the K'ua K'ua/Kuku of Far North Queensland (Kuku Yalanji?) and Erub/Mer (Torres Strait Islander) peoples. Deacon relocated to Port Melbourne, Victoria, in 1959 with her mother Eleanor Harding, then married to Destiny's father wharf labourer and unionist Warren Deacon. Soon after, Deacon's parents separated and she and her siblings were raised by her mother with the help of a close Indigenous community. Growing up, Deacon and her family lived in various Melbourne inner suburbs including commission housing, which while often tough opened her eyes to a whole other world. Deacon's interest in photography started at a very early age. However instead of pursuing photography Deacon decided to attend university and study politics, a field that her mother had been very interested and active within, with her involved with the United Council of Aboriginal Women. After attending the University of Melbourne and completing a Bachelor of Arts program in politics and obtaining a Diploma in teaching from La Trobe University, Deacon moved on to first become a history teacher across various community and secondary schools around Victoria, and then to a tutor and lecturer in Australian Writing and Culture, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Production at Melbourne University. It wasn't until 1990 after a stint on community radio for 3CR that she decided to move into professional photography, after holding an exhibition with a few friends. Artistic development Before her foray into professional photography, Deacon became involved with Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins, working from Canberra as a staff trainer. Her strong interest in politics led her to become one of his \\"Angels\\", which was the beginning of her artistic endeavors. Using what she had learnt about politics through Perkins, the \\"Angels\\", and her upbringing, Deacon started taking photographs of her culture using her trademark \\"black dollies\\" and other kitsch items as props to expose racism in Australia. Aesthetics Deacon said in an interview published in the Sydney Biennale 2000 \\"Photography is white people's invention. Lots of things seem really technical, for example the camera, the darkroom.. I've started taking the kind of pictures I do because I can't paint..and then I discovered it was a good way of expressing some feelings that lurk inside\\". Deacon works across a spectrum of different mediums including photography, video, installation and performance, but her most prominent is her use of dolls to convey her message about the racism that exists within Australia. Deacon's photography polarises popular Anglo culture against Indigenous existence, creating satirical images, using Aboriginal imagery, found items, family members, and friends in very strange scenarios. In Oz (1998) series Deacon incorporates Koori kitsch dolls and shows the construction of identity is an old game that she can play too. Using The Wizard of Oz as a starting point for her re-presentation of Aboriginal culture and identity, she recognises the fictionalising of history, identity and nationhood in Australia’s past – a reminder that things are not always as they appear, nor what we have been made to believe; that history is written much similar to a story. Deacon is said to have coined the term \\"Blak\\" as a reference to Indigenous Australian culture in 1991, in her exhibition entitled Blak lik mi. Using a term possibly appropriated from American hip hop or rap, the intention behind it is that it \\"reclaim[s] historical, representational, symbolical, stereotypical and romanticised notions of Black or Blackness\\", and expresses taking back power and control within a society that does not give its Indigenous peoples much opportunity for self-determination as individuals and communities. Deacon herself said that it was \\"taking on the 'colonisers' language and flipping it on its head\\", as an expression of authentic urban Aboriginal identity. Where's Mickey? (2003) shows the large difference between how Indigenous people are perceived by the white Australian population and the reality of her family and friends lives. Deacon has said about her work that the \\"Humour cuts deep. I like to think that there's a laugh and a tear in each\\". Work and exhibitions An early video work was \\"Home video\\" (1987). Deacon's first show, \\"Pitcha Mi Koori\\", was a part of the Melbourne Fringe Festival, and in 1991, her work was included in Aboriginal Women’s Exhibition, at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney. Her first solo exhibition, Caste Offs, was held in 1993 at the Australian Centre for Photography in Sydney. Deacon's work began to be included in group exhibitions in 1994, including Blakness: Blak City Culture! at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in Melbourne, True Colours: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Artists Raise the Flag at Bluecoat Gallery, Liverpool, UK; South London Gallery, London; City Gallery, Leicester and in Australia. \\"Welcome to My Koori World\\" (video, 1992) was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in a show An Eccentric Orbit: Video Art in Australia, which was also picked up by ABC Television for the Blackout series. In 1998 Deacon explored her mother's life by photographing her family in the Torres Strait Islands after her death two years previous, documenting it in a show titled Postcards from Mummy this journey \\"allowed her to come to come to terms with the loss of her mother and the importance of history, memory and place to identify\\". Deacon's work has been featured in numerous local and international exhibitions such as Perspecta (1993, 1999), Havana Biennial (1994), Johannesburg Biennale (1995), Brisbane’s Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art (1996), Melbourne International Biennial (1999), Biennale of Sydney (2000), Yokohama Triennale (2001), Das Lied von der Erde (2001) and Documenta 11 (2002). Walk & don’t look blak was Deacon's first large retrospective held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, in 2004, encompassing the past 14 years of her work and practice. From there it toured the Ian Potter Museum of Art at Melbourne University, the Adam Art Gallery and the Wellington City Gallery in Wellington, New Zealand, the Tjibao Cultural Centre in Noumea, New Caledonia, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in Japan. For 2004: Australian Culture Now at The Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, Deacon was commissioned to make a film for the programme Neighbours (the remix). In 2020 the National Gallery of Victoria mounted a retrospective exhibition of her work, the first in 15 years, curated by Indigenous curator Myles Russell-Cook, called DESTINY. Scheduled to run from 27 March to 9 August 2020, the opening of the gallery was delayed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia Russell-Cook also edited the mammoth Destiny, a monograph celebrating her art and life.

The chamber was named after the Lyon scouts, La Verna Troop, who helped in the attempted rescue of Marcel Loubens who died following a fall during the 1952 explorations. Waterfall in Salle de la Verna In 2003 a standard 4 person hot-air balloon was flown in Salle de la Verna. Geology La Verna is part of the , , and Gouffre des Partages cave system. Explorations still continue in this and in other systems within the extensive Pierre-Saint-Martin karst area where 13 underground rivers and a total of of passages, chambers and shafts have been mapped.ARSIP INFO Edition Spéciale \\"Les Traversées de La Pierre-Saint-Martin\\" p.15 - 2014 Most of the Gouffre de la Pierre-Saint-Martin is formed by dissolution in Cretaceous limestones, and the main river reaches a base level where it flows over insoluble schists of the Paleozoic basement rocks. The Salle de la Verna has formed where the river flows off the schist onto Devonian limestone. Over time, the river found a route through the soluble limestones, leaving the original downstream river passage (the Gallerie Aranzadi) high and dry. The chamber was formed by a process of solution and collapse, beginning about 200,000 years ago. The unconformity between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks is clearly exposed in the walls of the chamber. The river flowing through the chamber originated from the infiltration zones on the limestone plateaus, and emerges at springs lower, in the valley of Saint-Engrâce.Jean François PERNETTE – « Rivières sous le Pierre » - F. Nathan – 1983 Fauna In this mineral world lives a unique community of animals, adapted to the dark depths of the karst. They are small invertebrates, blind, and without pigmentation. The two most common species observed in La Verna are the Aphaenops loubensi and Aphaenops cabidochei. In order to survive, these insects need an atmosphere saturated with humidity. After fecundation, the female lays a single egg, out of which a small larva hatches. Contrary to insects on the surface, this larva immediately metamorphoses to an adult, without feeding. The biologist Michel Cabidoche studied these animals in the 60’s. Since the opening of la Verna to visitors, in 2010, a team of researchers of the French national museum of natural history, under the leadership of Professor Arnaud Faille, closely follows their evolution. History *1950-51: The discovery and exploration of the deep Lépineux shaft in the massif of La Pierre Saint Martin (at the time the deepest shaft ever descended). *13 August 1952: Marcel Loubens died as a result of a fall during the explorations. *13 August 1953: Georges Lépineux, Jimmy Théodor, Daniel Eppely, Michel Letrône and Georges Ballandraux, divided into two groups, discovered Salle de la Verna. One group opened the way, the other follows surveying as they went. They met in Salle de la Verna, where they inscribed their names. They had found what was at the time - and remained for many years - the world’s largest known underground chamber. They had also set a depth- record.Jacques ATTOUT – « Les hommes de la Pierre Saint Martin » - Collection Marabout Junior n°40 – 1954 *1956-60: The French National Electricity Company (EDF) decided to construct a tunnel. The plan was to capture the underground river that runs through the Salle de la Verna for the production of electricity. It took four years to dig the tunnel, but the project was abandoned for technical reasons. Cavers began using the tunnel as a short cut to continue their explorations.Corentin QUEFFELEC – « Jusqu'au fond du gouffre - Tome 1 » - Arcora - 1968 (réédition Spéléo Editions 1994) *2000: A private company, SHEM (Société Hydroélectrique du Midi) re-launched the hydro-electric power project. *January 2006: Work on the project began. An access-road was constructed and the tunnel restored. A dam was built across the river where it enters the Salle de la Verna creating a small reservoir of . More than of pressure pipe were installed across the chamber, out through the tunnel, and down to the bottom of the valley where a hydro-electric power-plant was built. Close cooperation between SHEM, cavers and the local authorities has led to the opening of la Verna to the public. *June 2007: The local authorities working together as a SIVU (Syndicat intercommunal à vocation unique) confirmed the exploitation of the site by the Caving Associations of the Atlantic Pyrenees. To achieve this, the cavers created a small company, which organizes guided visits. *1 July 2010: La Verna opened to the public. The cave is now accessible to everybody - including those with reduced mobility.

At the age of twelve, he began to study at the \\"Universidad Literaria de Sevilla\\", where he showed some talent as a writer, producing works on art and literature. It was also there that he had his first art lessons and became serious about an artistic career. Raphael and the English landscape painters were among his first influences. In 1862, he moved to Córdoba to manage the \\"Museo Provincial de Pintura\\".Brief biography @ Cordobapedia. Over the next few years, he founded the \\"Escuela de Música\\" and the \\"Escuela Provincial de Bellas Artes\\". He also organized and directed the \\"\\" and remained active as an author, contributing prolifically to the local newspapers and magazines. In addition to his cultural work, he was a lifetime member of the \\"Asociación de Obreros Cordobeses\\", a labor union, where he served as Secretary. Equally significant, perhaps, was his work as an art restorer. In his museum workshop, he restored paintings by Juan de Valdés Leal, Antonio del Castillo y Saavedra and many others, including the image of the \\"Virgen de Linares\\", from the Thirteenth Century. His interest in archaeology naturally led him to work for preservation as well as restoration. He was especially concerned about works of Arab and Jewish origin, which were being ignored or vandalized, so he formed an alliance with Father , a distinguished historical scholar who helped him with transcriptions. His efforts were crowned by an appointment to a seat on the \\"Comisión de Monumentos de Córdoba\\". Work His works, especially the later canvases, are classified as Costumbrista, although they often lack the anecdotal character typical of the genre. Many show the influence of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. His other two sons, Rafael and Enrique, also became painters of some note.

It was responsible for introducing new hybrids created by such important West Coast breeders as Luther Burbank and Albert Etter. History John Rock was born Johann Fels in Lauterbach, Germany, on August 19, 1836. He immigrated to the United States in 1852 and fought on the Union side in the Civil War before settling in California in 1863.  \\"Rock's Nurseries\\" in San Jose  John Rock had two nursery locations in San Jose, California, on Coyote Creek. The catalog for \\"Rock's Nurseries\\" for 1885 says that John Rock had 19 years of experience in California, putting the date of establishment at around 1865. Rock's Nurseries continued on some time after the establishment of the California Nursery Company. The San Jose City Directory for 1887 has advertisements for both the \\"California Nursery Company\\" in Niles and \\"Rock's Nurseries\\" in San Jose. There was a \\"Rock's Nurseries\\" catalog for 1888.  \\"California Nursery Company\\" in Niles  In 1884, the California Nursery Company was established in Niles, California (now a district in Fremont). After Rock's death in 1904, the nursery was run by William J. Landers and managed by W.V. Eberly. The year 1865 is often cited for the establishment of the California Nursery Company and has caused some confusion. The date 1865 probably refers to the establishment of \\"Rock's Nurseries\\" in San Jose, not the California Nursery Company. Sometime around the 1906-1907 catalog, the words \\"Established 1865\\" were added to the front cover along with \\"Incorporated 1884\\" and it was carried forward. In 1917, it was bought by George C. Roeding of Fresno. At first, the nursery was a wholesaler providing grape vines and fruit trees to California's growing agricultural industry, although early on it also supplied plants for the Palo Alto estate of California tycoon Leland Stanford. Later, in addition to its wholesale business, the nursery started a retail operation with ornamental trees and plants for homes and gardens. John Rock was interested in creating new plant hybrids and worked with West Coast plant breeders like Luther Burbank. His 1888 catalog featured some 500 varieties of fruit trees, 700 ornamental shrubs, and 270 roses. By the time Rock died, his nursery had introduced more new plant varieties to California than any other. In 1940, the northern California plant breeder Albert Etter began a partnership with the CNC with the goal of patenting and then marketing Etter's best apple varieties. The CNC introduced six Etter varieties in its 1945 catalog, including Pink Pearl. The CNC ultimately became the largest firm of its kind west of the Rockies. It was located close enough to the San Francisco Bay Area that it became a destination for gardeners and horticulturists. From the early 1930s to the mid-1960s, the CNC hosted annual bulb shows in spring that could draw up to 5000 visitors over a weekend.  California Nursery Historical Park  After 1972, some of the former nursery grounds were turned into a Fremont city park, the California Nursery Historic Park, although the family continued to lease out some land to other nurseries. Currently, the Roeding family operates the nursery as a mail-order business.

Sleeve notes  This is the Corries second volume in their two volume series \\"live from Scotland\\", recorded on tour 1974/75 at Glasgow City Hall, Motherwell Town Hall, Dunfermline Carnegie Hall and Edinburgh Usher Hall. In these two recordings, we have tried to capture the sense of occasion that a Corrie concert has become. A mammoth task from a recording viewpoint, as the tempo of the concerts, and of course the running order of the material, changes from night to night according to the mood of the boys, the accuracy of their memory, their feelings, the rapport of the crowd, the strength of the coffee at half time, I'm convinced the weather situation. These and many other excuses have been put to me by the boys for making my life a misery. To try and plot the moment to change tapes, to convince them that they won't be heard 30 feet away from the microphone, to tell them that hefty foot tapping will inevitably come over on the track, is a waste of breath and a source of endless amusement to Ronnie and Roy. Suffice to say that recording them on tour has made me lighter by nearly a stone and for that reason and of course for the laughter, the stirring moments, the sad songs, the sense of having tried and I hope achieved recording the Corries live, it hass all been worthwhile. Good listening. Alan Spence, Recording Supervisor.

There have been protests against the celebrations by groups who consider it a western influence. Almost every year, law and order problems occur on 14 February in many cities in India due to protests. Overview In the Medieval era, the acceptance of public affection died off. Lovers for different castes have been prosecuted and even sometimes there have been honor killings. Public display of affection such holding hands or kissing is considered unacceptable today in India. Following the economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, a new middle class emerged who could afford access to foreign TV channels and card shops. Valentine's Day became popular among this middle class, but not much in the lower economics classes. Many young and working Indians live away from their families. This gives, especially women, a choice in their relationships. The interest in dating sites has also increased. Commercial establishments have attempted to cash in on this new sub-culture. Unrequited love is sometimes met with harassment, which is known by the euphemism \\"eve-teasing\\"; and occasionally it becomes more violent. There have also been acid attacks. Criticism and protests Various political parties have condemned Valentine's Day as an unwelcome influence of western culture on India. Some also consider this a scam by corporations for their economic gain. Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray has called it an attack of the west on Indian culture and that it is attracting youth for commercial gain. Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray has said that people not wanting violence on the day should not celebrate it. He has also called the festival shameless and contrary to Indian culture. In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena often threatens commercial establishments to stop selling goods that celebrate Valentine's Day. The Mumbai city unit chief Nana Wadekar of Shiv Sena has stated that Valentine's Day encourages obscene and vulgar acts. Sri Ram Sena leader Pramod Muthalik has said that if his activists catch couples in public on Valentine's Day, they would be forcibly married. If the couples resist, then the girl with will be forced to tied rakhi to the boy, a ritual which would make them siblings. Other political parties and religious groups who have been known to protest Valentine's Day are, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, Sri Ram Sena, Students Islamic Organisation of India, Hindu Munnani, Hindu Makkal Katchi, etc. Activists have been known to raid card shops and burn Valentine's Day cards and flowers. Members of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal have also been known to throw rotten tomatoes at couples. There also have been reports of people attacking restaurants. Bajrang Dal has been known to put up billboards warning couples to not hold hands. Shiv Sena has warned that people expressing love in public will be photographed and the photographs will be sent to their families. Couples roaming in public parks are sometimes caught by vigilantes and their hair is cut off and their faces are painted black to humiliate them. Some groups conduct marriages of different animals like goat and dog, or dog and horse, to symbolise that the love displayed on this day is fake. Between February 3 and 15, 2010, Pune police proscribed \\"gathering in groups and disturbing peace, playing drums or any other music systems loudly, showing of affection in ways that tantamount to obscenity, throwing colours under influence of alcohol, disturbing peace in public places and obstructing traffic, doing vulgar acts in schools, colleges and encouraging anti-social activities\\" to be under Section 144 of the CrPC (unlawful assembly) in all public and private places under the jurisdiction of Pune police commissionerate. They declared that those found violating the order would be punished under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC. In February 2015, Chandra Prakash Kaushik of Hindu Mahasabha said that anyone found celebrating in public places, like malls and restaurants, in the week around Valentine's Day will be forcibly married. If one of them is non-Hindu, he/she will be converted to Hinduism before marriage. They also said that a social media team will be monitoring Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter, anyone showing love online will also be married off. =Parents Worship Day= In 2012, self proclaimed religious leader, Asaram, who is currently serving a life imprisonment for raping a minor girl, said that 14 February should be observed as \\"Parents Worship Day\\". He said instead of protesting against Valentine's Day and causing law and order problems, youth should be given an alternative. In 2015, the state of Chhattisgarh officially declared 14 February every year to be Parents' Day or Matru-Pitru Divas. It had started observing it in 2008 on the advice of Asaram. In 2013 and 2014, separate circulars were issued with instructions. On this day, parents are invited to school and students pray to them. Support and counter protests In January 2009, a pub was attacked in Mangalore by members of a group called Sri Ram Sena. Following which, the group's leader Pramod Muthalik announced that his organisation would also protest Valentine's Day. A group called \\"Consortium of Pub-going, Loose and Forward Women\\" was formed on Facebook and it asked people to mail pink underwear to Muthalik. The protest was named Pink Chaddi Campaign. About, 34,000 people participated. In Tamil Nadu, Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam, Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam and Democratic Youth Federation of India support the festival. On this day, Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam has performed inter caste marriages and Democratic Youth Federation of India has felicitated those who have entered an inter-caste marriage. On 14 February 2015, in response to Hindu Mahasabha's announcement to marry off couples found celebrating, several students of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University protested on the Mandir Marg, New Delhi, near the Hindu Mahasabha office. Many were dressed in wedding dresses and they were accompanied by a wedding band. About 220 students were arrested by the police when they began marching towards the Hindu Mahasabha office, as they had not taken permission for the protest.

Inclined towards syndicalism and standing as one of the most radical Russian unions of the period, Vikzhel played a decisive role in stymying the attempted Kornilov coup in August 1917. At the time of the October Revolution Vikzhel was the largest and best organized union in Russia. Simultaneously but independent of the Bolshevik Party's seizure of state power, Vikzhel would seize control of Russia's railways in the fall of 1917. Favoring a multi-party government, Vikzhel managed to leverage its position of strength through threat of a general transportation strike to force the Bolsheviks to add other socialist political parties to the previously all-Bolshevik government — a power play culminated by the provision of three ministerial portfolios to representatives of the Left Socialist Revolutionary Party. Vikzhel's limited success in pushing the Bolsheviks towards compromise and moderation proved to be short-lived, however, as the fledgling Soviet government soon manufactured a split of the All-Russian Union of Railwaymen and establishment of a rival governing Executive Committee known as Vikzhedor. Supplanted by the new Bolshevik-friendly organization, Vikzhel was ultimately dissolved in March 1918 by decree of the governing Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom).

During the Russian Revolution of 1905 a pioneering effort was made to organize Russian railway workers into an All-Russian Union of Railwaymen.George Jackson with Robert Devlin, Dictionary of the Russian Revolution. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 26-29. This forerunner of the 1917 labor organization by the same name conducted a strike in October 1905 which had escalated into a general strike in St. Petersburg and Moscow, paving the way for formation of the short-lived St. Petersburg Soviet of Workers' Delegates.The definitive monograph on this topic is Henry Reichman, Railwaymen and Revolution: Russia, 1905. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1987. The revolt against Tsarism soon collapsed, however, and the government of Tsar Nicholas II pushed back with a December 14 (O.S.) decree allowing railway lines to be placed under martial law.Reichman, Railwaymen and Revolution, pg. 291. The lengthy decree provided for the summary arrest of workers failing to following the orders of railway authorities, backed by jail terms of up to three months and fines of up to 500 rubles without trial. Gatherings of railway workers were prohibited, with strikers subject to immediate dismissal and possible arrest. So-called \\"punitive expeditions\\" aboard armored trains were quickly dispatched to take action against organized strikers. Some 150 railway strikers and bystanders were killed in massacres following the imposition of martial law.Reichman, Railwaymen and Revolution, pg. 292. More than 59,000 railway workers were ultimately terminated from their jobs as a result of the repression in 1906 and 1907, although many of these ultimately regained employment elsewhere in the Russian railroad industry following defeat of the revolution.Reichman, Railwaymen and Revolution, pg. 294. The Russian railway union was thus effectively crushed. =Establishment= Following the overthrow of Tsarism in the February Revolution of 1917, workers found no governmental obstacles to their self- organization into labor unions. Railway workers were in the front ranks of this effort, rapidly unionizing themselves as the All-Russian Union of Railwaymen at a convention held in Moscow on April 6, 1917 (O.S.). The 200 delegates to this gathering decided to establish themselves as a single industry-wide industrial union rather than as an alliance of specialized craft unions organizing workers based upon their specific tasks. A decentralized structure was agreed upon, which had the benefit of fostering local initiative but at the expense of united national action. The organizational conference set July 15, 1917 (O.S.) as the date for a formal First All-Russian Congress of Railwaymen to perfect its organizational form. Some 500 delegates assembled in Moscow on July 15 for the convocation of the First Congress, with the left wing of the Socialist Revolutionary Party in clear numerical domination. This gathering elected a governing council, an All-Russian Executive Committee, to conduct the affairs of the railway union between conventions. A total of 40 people were elected to this All-Russian Executive Committee of the Union of Railwaymen, known by its acronym Vikzhel. Of these, just two were members of the Bolshevik Party — which remained at this juncture a radical anti-war opposition party to the Provisional Government headed by Alexander Kerensky. These were part of a left wing of 15, which included as well Left Socialist- Revolutionaries and Menshevik-Internationalists. The majority moderate faction included members of the Right Socialist Revolutionary, Menshevik, and Popular Socialist parties. As the economic crisis of 1917 expanded and the country became more radical, Vikzhel likewise shifted to the left, with Left SR A.L. Malitskii assuming the chairmanship of the organization on September 15 (O.S.). Vikzhel remained far from lockstep with the waxing Bolshevik forces, however, with the union remaining committed to the essentially syndicalist principles of decentralization and workers' control in contrast to the hard centralism touted by the Bolsheviks. Vikzhel rapidly developed amidst the chaos into which the country had descended, establishing itself as the largest and best organized union in Russia by the fall of 1917.E.H. Carr, History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-23: Volume 2. London: Macmillan, 1950; pg. 394. =Kornilov Affair= Gen. Lavr Kornilov (1870-1918) heroically riding upon the shoulders of his officers, July 1, 1917 (O.S.). Alexander Kerensky (1881-1970), head of state of the Russian Provisional Government of 1917. One of the most historically significant episodes involving Vikzhel occurred during the Kornilov affair of August 1917. The spontaneous street riots known as the July Days had fizzled and been suppressed, leading to a public discrediting of the Bolshevik Party that had belatedly supported such direct action and a turn in public opinion towards firm central government.Alexander Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power: The Revolution of 1917 in Petrograd. New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1976; pg. 94. A sense of despair filled the country, marked by daily reports of peasant lawlessness in the countryside, worker strikes in the cities, moves toward national separation in Finland and Ukraine, collapse of military discipline at the war front, chaos and violence in the streets, and a collapse of the economic system. Prime Minister Kerensky proved powerless to stave this escalating crisis, with his cabinet disunited on a single course of action and the strength of the Petrograd Soviet looming ominously over his shoulder, ready to call the masses into the streets in protest once more in the event of a repressive misstep.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pp. 94-95. A broad array of conservative forces, including business leaders and their All- Russian Union of Trade and Industry, gentry representatives organized in the Union of Landowners, and military officers of the Union of Officers and Union of Cossack Troops rapidly lost faith in the Kerensky government to find its way out of the crisis.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pp. 95, 105. The monarchist tradition instilled by centuries of Tsarist rule loomed strong, and a drumbeat grew among the right for an overthrow of the stumbling young republic in favor of military leadership over the nation and its economy. A consensus emerged among these rightist elements to tap General Lavr Kornilov, commander-in-chief of the Russian army for the role of plenipotentiary leader of the Russian nation.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 96. Moreover, Kornilov's public status among middle class society was momentarily high, enhanced by the short-lived military successes of the army's June offensive, with which he was credited.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 98. Kornilov was dismissive of the February revolution and its move towards increased civilian control of the military and the creeping of political activity into army ranks.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pp. 101-102. He sought instead a purge of the officer corps and the expansion of special courts and capital punishment as a mechanism to restore military discipline and saw the continued existence of the moderate socialist Kerensky government as a fetter upon the implementation of this agenda. Kerensky reciprocated these feelings of mistrust, seeing in Kornilov an ambitious reactionary intent upon overthrow of the revolution and establishment of a military dictatorship in its stead — a sentiment shared by a substantial number of radicalized workers, fearing a new campaign of state repression akin to that which followed the collapse of the 1905 uprising.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pp. 104-106. In August Kornilov prepared the ground for a political offensive, visiting Petrograd and putting forward a plan to put the Petrograd Military District — previously controlled by Kerensky's Ministry of War — under his own personal authority.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 108. He also visited Moscow, upstaging the tepid reception given to the arrival of government ministers to a formal state conference with a carefully orchestrated railway ceremony featuring a military honor guard, saber-wielding Turkmen guards, and a military band.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 113. An uneasy political dance followed between Kerensky and Kornilov, in which each attempted to use the other to bolster his own claim as supreme leader of a future Russian government.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 116. Late in August (Old Style calendar) a concrete plot for a military coup was hatched for Kornilov by the Main Committee of the Union of Officers and the Republican Center and Military League, timed to coincide with the August 27 official celebration of the 6-month anniversary of the revolution.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 117. The festivities would be accompanied by street disorder, the plotters assumed, making plausible a declaration of martial law to restore order, under cloak of which a change in government could be made. Kerensky learned of the plot shortly before its execution and on August 26 sought and obtained self-dissolution of the cabinet for subsequent \\"restructuring\\" and the granting of unlimited authority by the outgoing cabinet to deal with Kornilov's \\"treachery\\" as he saw fit.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 125. Kerensky proved unable to by himself to divert the movement of Kornilov's troops to the capital, however, his telegraphic advice that \\"Petrograd is completely calm and no insurrections are expected\\" falling upon deaf ears.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 126. On August 27, troops personally loyal to Kornilov boarded trains heading for the capital city.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 127. Although the 6-month celebration of the revolution came and went, Kornilov's plan for a military takeover moved forward, with stock prices on the Petrograd stock exchange rocketing upwards on August 28 in anticipation of a rapid victory. It was here that Vikzhel played its historic role. On August 27, in conjunction with the celebration of the revolution, the Petrograd Soviet issued an emergency appeal to soldiers, telegraph operators, and railway workers to come to the defense of the revolution, declaring that orders of the military high command were to be ignored and the movement of counterrevolutionary troops stymied.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 131. That same day Vikzhel established a special committee dedicated to the military emergency created by Kornilov.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 142. Vikzhel sent telegrams up and down the railway network, demanding the stoppage of \\"suspicious telegrams\\" and the rapid transmission of information about the size and destination of any troop movements by rail. Railway workers were directed to delay and halt the movement of troops by any means necessary, up to and including sidetracking, abandoning their posts, blocking the right of way, and dismantling track. Combined with the mobilization of soldiers and formation of Red Guards units of armed factory workers in the city of Petrograd, the delaying actions of the Russian railway workers to block troop movements — coordinated by Vikzhel — proved decisive. By the evening of August 29 the inadequacy of Kornilov's forces in the face of a newly united opposition had become apparent to all, and the coup's forces began to melt away.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pg. 146. Delayed troops riding the rails were isolated and surrounded, the situation explained and illegal orders repudiated, and new vows of loyalty sworn to the revolutionary government.Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power, pp. 148-149. =October Revolution= With V.I. Ul'ianov (Lenin) and the Bolsheviks seized power in Petrograd and Moscow on October 25 (O.S.) (November 7), 1917, Vikzhel asserted itself as a rival nexus of power. As historian E. H. Carr observed: > \\"From the moment of the October revolution Vikzhel took over the > administration of the railways on its own account and acted as an > independent power. In short, it played the role of a mammoth factory > committee exercising 'workers' control.' It recognized no political > authority, and no interest other than the professional interest of the > railwayman.\\" The two sides came into direct conflict for the first time on the day after the Bolshevik victory, at the second and last session of the 2nd All-Russian Congress of Soviets. It was there that Lev Kamenev announced the appointment of a new all-Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) to head the country's executive and political functions. This information was met by a representative of Vikzhel who upon remonstration was allowed to read a written statement of Vikzhel in which the union expressed its \\"negative attitude to the seizure of power by any one political party\\" and called for the formation of \\"a revolutionary socialist government responsible to the plenipotentiary organ of the whole revolutionary democracy.\\"Quoted in Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 2, pg. 395. Moreover, Vikzhel threatened that it and it alone would assume control of the country's railways and threatened to cut off supplies to the city of Petrograd should efforts at repression be made by the new government.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 2, pg. 395. The Bolshevik authorities, struggling to maintain control of the city of Petrograd and still engaged in a fight to win control in Moscow, stood powerless to contest Vikzhel's ultimatum. Pressured by a threat of a general strike on the railroads, the Bolsheviks grudgingly entered into negotiations with other socialist parties with the object of establishing a multi-party government in accordance with Vikzel's demands. For its part Vikzhel attempted to help establish a broad coalition against one-party Bolshevik rule and the inevitable civil war which was expected to follow, joining with representatives of moderate socialist political parties to form a group called the Committee to Save the Country and Revolution with a view to the successful launch of the multi-party Constituent Assembly and to achievement of a \\"democratic peace\\" in the ongoing war with the German empire.Jay B. Sorenson, The Life and Death of Soviet Trade Unionism, 1917-1928. New York: Atherton Press, 1969; pg. 46. =Post-revolutionary discord= The October 28 (O.S.) general strike threat which put Bolshevik leaders into negotiations with other political parties did not generate an immediate agreement, however. Lenin and the Bolshevik Party stalled for two days as discord grew in the streets of Petrograd.Sorenson, The Life and Death of Soviet Trade Unionism, pg. 47. Finally the decision was made by the Bolsheviks to enter discussions with the representatives of other parties and three days of nearly continuous negotiations at Vikzhel headquarters ensued. With Kamenev leading the Bolshevik side in these negotiations, the decision was reached for the creation of a new Council of People's Commissars featuring a non-Bolshevik majority. The Bolshevik Party was deeply divided over the deal negotiated by Kamenev, with top party leaders Lenin and Leon Trotsky bitterly opposed to the surrender of control to other organizations. The majority of the governing Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party favored the continuation of negotiations, however, fearing overstepping what was possible and making a move which would alienate the party's core constituency of urban factory workers. Although power sharing negotiations were to be continued, the decision was made to harden the negotiating posture in an effort to drive out moderate elements from the discussions.Sorenson, The Life and Death of Soviet Trade Unionism, pg. 48. Opponents of this hard line were threatened with expulsion for violation of party discipline if their resistance did not cease. Vikzhel was again stalled by the Bolsheviks, who dodged a meeting scheduled for November 4 (17) and forced a rescheduling to November 6 (19), a meeting which again failed to come to an agreement on the size and structure of the division of state offices. Parties across the spectrum were alienated by the Bolsheviks' intransigence, with representatives of the Bund and Menshevik Party expressing the view that coalition government had become impossible.Sorenson, The Life and Death of Soviet Trade Unionism, pg. 49. Negotiations slowly slogged forward for more than two weeks, finally ending on November 15 (O.S.) (28), 1917 with the granting of three seats on Sovnarkom to members of the Left SR party. Somewhat surprisingly, this one-sided coalition of just two parties proved sufficient for Vikzhel's purposes, a concession sweetened with the granting of the post of People's Commissar of Communications to a former member of Vikzhel himself. Vikzhel seems to have put its faith in the forthcoming Constituent Assembly, elections for which has been held, and were willing to forgive a short-lived government with only the most limited non-Bolshevik participation in the belief that a more representative, non-Bolshevik government was in the offing.Sorenson, The Life and Death of Soviet Trade Unionism, pg. 50. The All-Russian Union of Railwaymen was at that time holding another national congress and it narrowly passed a vote of confidence in the Bolshevik government — a move taken by the Bolsheviks as an assertion of continued independent authority. The Bolsheviks, sensing a radical mood among the union's rank and file which was supportive of the Communist demand for a unified socialist government, went over Vikzhel's head, generating a split of left wing delegates to the congress.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 2, pp. 395-396. These bolters established a parallel organization, headed by a new executive body known as Vikzhedor.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 2, pg. 396. =Dissolution= Footnotes Further reading * Wilson R.

A younger son of the first marquis of Aycinena, peninsular-born Juan Fermín de Aycinena (1729-1796),Richmond F. Brown, \\"Juan Fermín de Aycinena\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 247. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Mariano was a leader of Guatemalan independence from Spain.Richmond F. Brown, \\"Mariano de Aycinena\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 247. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. He served governor of the State of Guatemala in the Central American Federation from 1 March 1827 to 12 April 1829 and patriarch of the Aycinena family. The family had the commercial monopoly in Central American during the Spanish colonial era later year thanks to the Consulado de Comercio. He was one of the signatories of Central American independence and lobbied heavily for the annexation of Central America to the Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide. This arrangement would keep the family's economic position and privileges following independence. After being expelled along with the Aycinena family in 1829 after being defeated by Francisco Morazán, went into exile in the United States and then to Mexico. He came back to Guatemala after the conservatives had allied with general Rafael Carrera; but then he retired from public life and hand the Aycinena family leadership to Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol.  Biography  Signing of the Central America declaration of independence on September 15, 1821. Mariano de Aycinena is sitting at the center of this painting of Rafael Beltranena. Member and leader of the most influential family in the Guatemalan region during the Spanish colonial era, he clashed with Captain General José de Bustamante y Guerra when Aycinena y Piñol was in charge of the Ayuntamiento (city council) in 1812.The ayuntamiento was locus of power for American-born Spaniards as opposed to the Audiencia, the high court, which was dominated by peninsular-born Spaniards. In 1821, Fernando VII power in Spain was weakened by French invasions and other conflicts, and Mexico declared the Plan de Iguala; this led Aycinena y Piñol and other criollos to demand the weak Captain General Gabino Gaínza to declare Guatemala and the rest of Central America as an independent entity. Aycinena y Piñol was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence of Central America from the Spanish Empire, and then lobbied strongly for the annexation of Central America to the Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide, due to its conservative and ecclesiastical nature. Aycinena remained in the legislature and was advisor of the Governors of Guatemala in the next few years. In October 1826, Central American Federation president Manuel José de Arce y Fagoaga dissolved the Legislature and tried to establish a Unitarian System for the region, switching from the Liberal to the Conservative party, that Aycinena led. The rest of Central America did not want this system; they wanted the Aycinena family out of power altogether, and therefore, the Central American Civil War (1826-1829) started. From this war emerged the dominant figure of the Honduran general Francisco Morazán. = Governor of the State of Guatemala = Aycinena was appointed as Governor of Guatemala on 1 March 1827 by president Manuel José Arce. His time in office was a dictatorship: he censored free press and any book with liberal ideology was forbidden. He also establisher Martial Law and the retroactive death penalty. He reinstated mandatory tithing for the secular clergy of the Catholic Church = Invasion of General Morazán in 1829 = Liberal Honduran Caudillo Francisco Morazán. Morazán and his liberal forces were fighting around San Miguel, in El Salvador beating any conservative federal forces sent by Guatemalan general Manuel Arzú from San Salvador. Then, Arzú decided to take matters in his own hands and left colonel Montúfar in charge of San Salvador and went after Morazan. After realizing that Arzu was after him, Morazan left for Honduras to look for more volunteers for his army. On September 20, Manuel Arzá was close to the Lempa River with 500 men, when he was notified that the rest of his army had capitulated in San Salvador. Morazan then went back to El Salvador with a considerable army and general Arzú, feigning a sickness, fled to Guatemala, leaving lieutenant colonel Antonio de Aycinena in command. Aycinena and his 500 troops were going to Honduras when they were intercepted by Morazan troops in San Antonio, forcing Aycinena to concede defeat on October 9. With Aycinena defeat, there were no more conservative federal troops in El Salvador. On October 23, general Morazán marched triumphally in San Salvador. A few days later, he went to Ahuachapán, to organize an army to take down the conservative aristocrats led by Mariano Aycinena y Piñol in Guatemala and establish a regime favorable to the central American Federation that was the dream of the liberal criollos. Upon learning this, Aycinena y Piñol tried to negotiate with Morazán to no avail: Morazán was willing to take down the aristocrats at all costs. Map olf Guatemala in 1829. Note that borders with Mexico, Yucatán and Chiapas are not defined. Plaza Central of Antigua Guatemala in 1829. the old Palacio de la Capitanía General was still destroyed after the 1773 earthquake. After his victory in San Miguelito, Morazán's army increased in size given that a lot of voluntaries from Guatemala joined him. On March 15, when Morazan and his army were on their way to occupy their previous positions, they were intercepted by federal troops in Las Charcas. However, Morazán had a better position and smashed the federal army. The battle field was left littered with corpses, while the allies took a great number of prisoners and weaponry. The allies continued to recapture their old positions in San José Pinula and Aceituno, and place Guatemala City under siege once again. General Verveer, Ambassador from the ruler of The Netherlands and Belgium before the Central American government and who was in Guatemala to negotiate the construction of a transoceanic canal in Nicaragua, tried to mediate between the State of Guatemala and Morazán, but did not succeed. Military operations continued, with great success for the allies. To prepare for the siege from Morazán troops, on 18 March 1829, Aycinena decreed martial law, but he was soundly defeated. On 12 April 1829, Aycinena conceded defeat and he and Morazán signed an armistice pact; then, he was sent to prison, along with his Cabinet members and the Aycinena family was secluded in their mansion. Morazán, however, annulled the pact on April 20, since his real objective was to take power away from the conservatives and the Catholic Church in Guatemala, whom the Central American leaders despised since they had had the commerce and power monopoly during the Spanish Colony. In these battles Rafael Carrera was only a 15-year-old soldier, whose family suffered humiliation and mistreatment by Morazán's troops; José Batres Montúfar and Miguel García Granados also fought for Guatemala and were taken prisoners; and Manuel Francisco Pavón Aycinena, cousin of Aycinena y Piñol, was a lieutenant colonel in the Guatemalan Army.  Exile  On 26 April 1829, from prison, Aycinena sent a letter a Morazán, protesting the pact annulment. He also pointed out to the liberal leader that there was no reason to break the pact and that, after all, he was the only responsible for what had happened and not the rest of the Aycinena family. But Morazán expelled all of them and most of the regular clergy from Central America and confiscated most of their belongings. He returned to Guatemala six years later, but had to go into exile once again, this time to Comitán, México. Finally, he returned to Guatemala in 1837, was in the legislature and was in charge of the Consulado de Comercio -Conservartive Merchant association of Guatemala-.  Death  Aycinena y Piñol returned to Guatemala after general Rafael Carrera established himself firmly in power. Aycinena retired from public life, handing over the Aycinena family leadership to Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol. He died in 1855, at a time that Manuel Francisco Pavón Aycinena had been successful in naming Carrera as President for Life and Guatemala was prosperous and in peace for the first time since the Independence.

The emblem consists of the words \\"Autonomous Administration\\" in Arabic, surrounded by seven red stars representing the regions of northeast Syria, as well as a branch of olives and spike of wheat, two crops grown in the region. Surrounding all of the symbols is the words \\"Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria\\" written in Arabic, Kurmanji, Syriac, and Turkish, the languages spoken in the region. The blue and yellow semicircles the whole emblem is put upon represents the Euphrates river and the \\"permanent spring\\" of the region. A flag with the Autonomous Administration's emblem on a white field is also used occasionally to represent the Administration itself. One of the most commonly used flags, especially in Kurdish-majority areas, is the tricolor flag that was adopted by the Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV- DEM), a prominent democratic confederalist organization in the region. The green, yellow and red colors are traditionally associated with Kurdish people, for example in the modern Flag of Kurdistan. A horizontal tricolor with blue, yellow, and red is used by the Syriac Union Party and its military wing in areas with a significant Syriac-Assyrian presence.

He is known for leading the Lingnan School's effort to modernize Chinese traditional painting as a \\"new national art.\\"Minglu, Gao, and Norman Bryson. Inside Out: New Chinese Art. San Francisco: San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1998, page 26. Along with his brother Gao Qifeng and friend Chen Shuren, Gao Jianfu brought the nihonga style of painting to China. Early life Gao Jianfu was born in 1879 in the city of Canton, located in the Guangdong Province. Education When Gao Jianfu was thirteen, he entered the studio of Chinese artist Ju Lian in Lishan, and for the next seven years he acted as his apprentice. During his time with Ju Lian, Gao Jianfu painted in a similar style as his master: bright, colorful, and realistic. The subject matter of his paintings were mainly birds, flowers, and landscapes. At Ju Lian's studio, Gao Jianfu became close friends with Chen Shuren, a fellow artist. In 1903, Gao Jianfu began working under the painter and collector Wu Deyi. Here he was introduced to works of the Chinese tradition. He studied at the Canton Christian College, now known as Lingnan University. Two of his most influential instructors included \\"a French teacher of painting only known by his Chinese name, Mai La,\\" and Yamamoto Baigai, one of the many Japanese teachers then in China. Greatly inspired by his professors, Jianfu felt compelled to leave for Tokyo. Time in Japan In the winter of 1906, Gao Jianfu left for Tokyo. After spending some time there and finding himself poor and without much food, he returned to Canton for the summer. In 1907, Jianfu returned to Tokyo with his nineteen-year-old brother, Gao Qifeng. They met up with their friend Chen Shuren. During his time in Japan, the three men were exposed to the nationalist debates \\"then ranging in the Japanese art world over the modernizing impact of Western art on Japan's local artistic traditions.\\" Jianfu became interested in the syntheses of Western and traditional approaches, which were parallel to work in the contemporary Japanese art world. Jianfu, along with his peers of the Lingnan School, saw this blend of styles as a model for modern national art. Many of the Lingnan students joined Sun Yat-sen's anti-Manchu movement, a revolutionary nationalist movement. Artwork Jianfu once wrote: \\"I think we should not only take in elements of Western painting. If there are good points in Indian painting, Egyptian painting, Persian painting, or masterpieces of other countries, we should embrace all of them too, as nourishment for Chinese painting.\\" Although Jianfu was greatly interested in Western art and joined societies that promoted this style, his artwork during his time in Japan shows little influence of Western art. His art mainly reflects the work of nihonga painters like Kano Hogai, Hashimoto Gaho, and Takeuchi Seiho. Often Jianfu would paint flowers, plants, and grasses. He also took inspiration from traditional Chinese artists Tang Yin and Lan Ying. In the 1920s, Jianfu's paintings showcased elements of \\"realism derived from Western art,\\" as well as traditional Chinese ink and brushwork. The subject matter of his work strayed away from the themes of traditional art (i.e. flowers, birds, landscapes, etc.) and focused more on contemporary reality. In 1927 the connection between his art and political agenda was made clear with the unveiling of a new exhibit in Canton. The series of airplane paintings showcased a banner with Sun Yat-sen's slogan, \\"Aviation to Save the Country.\\" This propaganda can especially be seen in Jianfu's paintings, \\"New Battlefield,\\" \\"Air Defense,\\" and \\"Flying in the Rain.\\" Throughout his time in Macao during World War II, Jianfu painted Skulls Crying over the Nation's Fate. It depicted a pile skulls lying in a field of grass. Later years =Work with Gao Qifeng= In 1912, after the overthrow of the Manchus, Gao Jianfu and his brother moved to Shanghai. They began publishing a journal titled Zhen xiang huabao (The True Record). It featured articles on art and politics, as well as published essays promoting a new, modernized national art in China. Although it ran for only a year, the journal was one of the first to bring art to the public. The brothers advocated government support of the arts. The two also opened the nation's first public galleries for the exhibit and sale of art works, the Aesthetic Bookstore. Jianfu and Qifeng stayed in Shanghai till 1918. By 1923, the brothers established the Spring Awakening Art Academy in Canton. =Later life= In 1929, Jianfu was accused of anti-foreign sentiments during his time as the chief organizer of the government's first National Art Exhibition held in Nanjing. Because The Lingnan School was featured prominently, there was hostile response for the inclusion of non-Chinese artistic tendencies. In 1936, Jianfu began teaching at Sun Yat-Sen University. He continued to publish articles, where he defended his concept of new national art. He suggested that national painting abandon the \\"elitism\\" of traditional art, and engage more directly with the Chinese public. In 1938, Gao Jianfu left Japanese-occupied Canton for the island of Macao. He returned to Canton in 1945. At the time Mao Zedong came to power in 1949, Jianfu once again fled to Macao. He died in 1951.

Liner Notes Liner notes written by Jim Bianco. \\"Whether we like it or not, in many ways, human beings are exactly the same- for the most part we all have legs that walk us, fingers that point us, minds that torture us and hearts that, when operating correctly, lead us clumsily through our lives. But still, there is something distinct in all of us that perseveres. Something singular and unrepeatable. Our memories, for example. Or the choices we have made in our lives. Or the resulting consequences of those choices that we must live with. For this record, I asked 17 different people the same 69 questions. From their answers I wrote these songs. At first, I sent out the questions with a hint of panic, concerned that I was setting myself up to write the same song over and over again, 17 times, desperately grasping for a way to change a word here or there in an attempt to make them unique. Green eyes versus brown eyes, Toledo versus Cincinnati, etc. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case. The questions are documented on the insert of this record. The answers are in the songs.

Above and Beyond documents the story of four American, foreign, and Israeli pilots who flew warplanes to help defend the new state of Israel during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War against Arab armies that sought to destroy the new country. The film was notable with the cinematography of Harris Done (The Last Days (1998)), special effects by Industrial Light and Magic, and an original score from Hans Zimmer's Studio. The film won the Philadelphia Jewish Film Festival 34 Best Documentary Audience Award. Plot In 1948, the new state of Israel is about to declare its independence after Mandatory Palestine is partitioned. The surrounding Arab states are about to launch an invasion with overwhelming superiority in numbers and weaponry compared to the emergent Israeli defences. With no air force or aircraft, American and other foreign pilots are called upon to start a nascent military air force. The first aircraft are bought from the massive U.S. government surplus stocks, and are former USAF Curtiss C-46 Commando transports, used in shipping war materiel back to Israel. Many pilots volunteered to join the Air Force in fear of a second Holocaust occurring. Facing restrictions that precluded help to belligerent nations, the first volunteers who choose to help have to find ways to work around U.S. government regulations. Al Schwimmer, a U.S. citizen, later charged with violating U.S. neutrality, takes charge of a transport operation. He registered the C-46 transports to Panama as Lineas Aereas de Panama aircraft, and flew them to Israel via a circuitous route that includes Natal, Brazil, Casablanca, Morocco, and Rome, which becomes the headquarters of the volunteer fighter pilots. The Air Force were permitted to bring five aircraft with them to battle. Chief among the group is Canadian \\"Ace-of-aces\\" George \\"Buzz\\" Beurling, who dies in a mysterious crash while testing a Noorduyn Norseman light transport. When asked about their feelings, Schwimmer replied, \\"we were proud that we were finally doing something for our homeland.\\" With the assistance of officials in Czechoslovakia, a number of Avia S-199 fighter aircraft, a variant of the Messerschmitt Bf 109, were obtained. The fighter pilots who trained in Czechoslovakia include Lou Lenart, Leon Frankel, Harold Livingston, Milton Rubenfeld, George Lichter, and Gideon Lichtman. Universally, the trainees hated the Avia S-199, called the \\"Messer- shitt\\" by Lichtman. After transporting the fighter aircraft to Israel, the first four aircraft are deployed to attack an Egyptian armored column moving on Tel Aviv. With the attack taking the enemy by surprise, the Egyptians retreat. Other air attacks help to bring about a truce between the combatants. During the truce, Israeli volunteers in the United States manage to purchase and smuggle two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers out of the country. When war is declared again, the B-17s are in the air, overflying the Middle East, and divert to an attack on Cairo. Aerial prowess proves to be a deciding factor in the coming battles, as a group of Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk IXE fighter aircraft is purchased from Czechoslovakia. Israeli fighter pilots flying a mix of Avia S-199s and Spitfires tangled with Egyptian Spitfires, with the first air-to-air combat ending with Gideon Lichtman bringing down an Egyptian Spitfire, albeit in his \\"Messer-shitt\\". As the volunteer-driven program becomes more organized, with leaders such as Modi Alon, \\"Smoky\\" Simon, Ezer Weizman, and Dani Shapira taking charge, a strong defensive Israeli Air Force is created. Unfortunately, two of the pilots who volunteered died.

Reception Above and Beyond was critically reviewed by Ben Keningsberg for The New York Times. He said, in part, \\"Drawing on interviews with historians and the surviving pilots, as well as re-enactments and archival footage, 'Above and Beyond' is partly a procedural. It explains how the pilots hopscotched countries to evade detection. (According to the film, Americans who helped Israel’s military risked jeopardizing their United States citizenship.) Some of the planes used were manufactured at a factory in Czechoslovakia that only years earlier had served the Germans. The men unabashedly reminisce about how their missions earned them female admirers. These fond recollections of derring-do hail from a different era, and the movie’s one-sided view of history is bound to start arguments. The film is best appreciated as a straightforward testimonial: old war buddies’ hurrah against anti-Semitism.\\"Keningsberg, Ben. \\"Jewish American pilots fighting for Israel; ‘Above and Beyond’.\\" The New York Times, January 29, 2015.

Although many types exist, most small molecule sensors comprise a subunit that selectively binds to a metal that in turn induces a change in a fluorescent subunit. This change can be observed in the small molecule sensor's spectrum, which can be monitored using a detection system such as a microscope or a photodiode. Different probes exist for a variety of applications, each with different dissociation constants with respect to a particular metal, different fluorescent properties, and sensitivities. They show great promise as a way to probe biological processes by monitoring metal ions at low concentrations in biological systems. Since they are by definition small and often capable of entering biological systems, they are conducive to many applications for which other more traditional bio-sensing are less effective or not suitable. Uses A Sodium-Potassium pump that causes changing concentrations of metal ions in a biological system. Metal ions are essential to virtually all biological systems and hence studying their concentrations with effective probes is highly advantageous. Since metal ions are key to the causes of cancer, diabetes, and other diseases, monitoring them with probes that can provide insight into their concentrations with spatial and temporal resolution is of great interest to the scientific community. There are many applications that one can envision for small molecule sensors. It has been shown that one can use them to differentiate effectively between acceptable and harmful concentrations of mercury in fish. Further, since some types of neurons uptake zinc during their operation, these probes can be used as a way to track activity in the brain and could serve as an effective alternative to functional MRI. One can also track and quantify the growth of a cell, such as a fibroblast, that uptakes metal ions as it constructs itself. Numerous other biological processes can be tracked using small molecule sensors as many change metal concentrations as they occur, which can then be monitored. Still, the sensor must be tailored for its specific environment and sensing requirements. Depending on the application, the metal sensor should be selective for a certain type of metal, and especially needs to be able to bind its target metal with greater affinity than metals that naturally exist at high concentrations within the cell . Further, they should provide a response with a strong modulation in fluorescent spectrum and hence provide a high signal to noise ratio. Finally, it is essential that a sensor is not toxic to the biological system in which it is used. Mechanisms of detection Cartoon depicting a shift in spectrum of a small molecule sensor upon the binding of a metal Most detection mechanisms involved in small molecule sensors comprise some modulation in the fluorescent behavior of the sensing molecule upon binding the target metal. When a metal coordinates to such a sensor, it may either enhance or reduce the original fluorescent emission. The former is known as the Chelation Enhancement Fluorescence effect (CHEF), while the latter is called the Chelation Enhancement Quenching effect (CHEQ). By changing the intensity of emission at different wavelengths, the resulting fluorescent spectrum may attenuate, amplify, or shift upon the binding and dissociation of a metal. This shift in spectra can be monitored using a detector such as a microscope or a photodiode. Listed below are some examples of mechanisms by which emission is modulated. Their participation in CHEQ or CHEF is dependent on the metal and small molecule sensor in question. =Primary Mechanisms of Detection= *Paramagnetic Fluorescence Quenching, the allowance of new electronic states upon binding a paramagnetic metal atom *Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET), the blocking of a lower energy state due to the binding of a metal atom. *Photoinduced Charge Transfer (PCT), the modulation of energy levels in a complex by charge transfer within a conjugated pi system. *Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), the transfer of an exciton from a donor to an acceptor, modulating the emission spectrum. *Excimer/Exciplex formation, the formation of a state that is a hybrid of the ground and excited states. This has novel fluorescent properties. *Chemodosimeters, complexes that undergo irreversible reactions with other species upon binding a metal to form new compounds with novel fluorescent spectra. Fluorophores Structure of Quinoline an example of a Dansyl group compound, Dansyl chloride Fluorophores are essential to our measurement of the metal binding event, and indirectly, metal concentration. There are many types, all with different properties that make them advantageous for different applications. Some work as small metal sensors completely on their own while others must be complexed with a subunit that can chelate or bind a metal ion. Rhodamine for example undergoes a conformation change upon the binding of a metal ion. In so doing it switches between a colorless, non-fluorescent spirocyclic form to a fluorescent, pink open cyclic form. Quinoline based sensors have been developed that form luminescent complexes with Cd(II) and fluorescent ones with Zn(II). It is hypothesized to function by changing its lowest luminescent state from n–* to –* when coordinating to a metal. When the Dansyl group DNS binds to a metal, it loses a sulfonamide hydrogen, causing fluorescence quenching via a PET or reverse PET mechanism in which an electron is transferred either to or from the metal that is bound. Examples =Zinc= Zinc is one of the most common metal ions in biological systems. Small molecule sensors for it include: *ZX1, a compound comprizing a dipicolylamine (DPA) Zinc binding subunit that has greater affinity for Zinc than other species found in solution such as Ca and Mg. *Zinpyr-1 (ZP1), a compound containing a dichlorofluorescein fluorescent compound bound to two 2-picolamine (DPA) species that bind Zn(II). ZP1 is part of a family of zinc sensors known as the Zinpyr series, the members of which are variants on ZP1 to enable specific affinities and fluorescence profiles. *ZnAF-1 sensors that comprise an aryl donor and a xanthenone acceptor and have a large change in fluorescence upon binding Zn(II). They have been used to study uptake of Zn(II) in CA3 pyramidal neurons. =Copper= Copper is a biologically important metal to detect. It has many sensors developed for it including: *CTAP-1, a sensor that shows a response in the UV region when Cu(I) binds to an azatetrathiacrown motif that in turn excites a pyrazoline-based dye that is attached. To use the probe, one excites it at 365 nm. If it is bound to Cu, then it will increase its fluorescence intensity. CTAP-1 is effective as it has a large modulation in its spectrum upon binding Cu, and is selective for the binding of Cu over other metals. *Coppersensor-1 (CS1) that comprises a thioether rich motif that binds to Cu(I) causing the excitation of a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dye in the visible region. The probe has good selectivity for Cu(I) over alkaline earth metals, Cu(II), and d-block metals. =Iron= Iron is used a great deal in biological systems, a fact that is well known due to its role in Hemoglobin. For it, there are many small molecule sensors including: *Pryrene-TEMPO, in which the binding of iron to TEMPO quenches the fluorescence of pyrene when no Fe(II) is bound. Upon binding however, TEMPO is reduced and pyrene regains fluorescence. This probe is limited in that an analogous response can be generated by unwanted free radicals, and that it can only by used in acidic solution. *DansSQ, in which Fe(II) binding increases fluorescence at 460 nm. It consists of a Dansyl group bound to styrylquinoline and operates by the disruption of intra-molecular charge transfer upon the binding of Fe(II). It is limited in that it is only soluble in acetonitrile in 10% H2O. =Cobalt= Cobalt sensors have been made that capitalize on the breaking of C-O bonds by Co(II) in a fluorescent probe known as Cobalt Probe 1 (CP1). =Mercury= Mercury is a toxic heavy metal, and as such it is important to be able to detect it in biological systems. Sensors include: *Mercury Sensors (MS), a family of sensors that comprise complexes of fluorescein and napthofluorescein. The MS1 probe increases its emission upon binding of Hg(II), while maintaining great affinity for mercury over other heavy metal ions. *The S3 sensor is based on a BODIPY complex which undergoes a significant increase in fluorescence upon the binding of Hg(II). *MF1 uses a soft thioether chelator for Hg(II) bound to a fluorescein-like xanthenone reporter. It has good contrast upon binding mercury and good selectivity. MF1 is sensitive enough that it has been proposed to be used to test fish for toxic levels of mercury.

Bleaching agents, usually peroxides, are usually sufficiently active only from 60 °C on. With bleach activators, this activity can already be achieved at lower temperatures. Bleach activators react with hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution to form peroxy acids, they are a component of most laundry detergents. Peroxy acids are more active bleaches than hydrogen peroxide at lower temperatures (<60 °C) but are too unstable to be stored in their active form and hence must be generated in situ. The most common bleach activators used commercially are tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) and sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (NOBS). NOBS is the main activator used in the U.S.A. and Japan, TAED is the main activator used in Europe. Structure and properties Bleach activators are typically made up of two parts: the peroxy acid precursor and the leaving group; and are modified by altering these parts. The peroxy acid precursor affects the bleaching properties of the peroxy acid: determining the activity, selectivity, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and oxidation potential. The leaving group influences the solubility, perhydrolysis rate and storage stability of the activator. Mechanism of activation Bleach activation is also known as perhydrolysis. Persalts are inorganic salts that are used as hydrogen peroxide carriers (examples include sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate). Persalts and bleach activators are included together in powder laundry detergents that contain bleach. In the wash, both compounds dissolve in the water. When dissolved in water, the persalt releases hydrogen peroxide (e.g. from sodium percarbonate): :2Na2CO3∙3H2O2 → 2Na2CO3 \\\\+ 3H2O2 In a basic wash solution, hydrogen peroxide loses a proton and is converted to the perhydroxyl anion: :H2O2 H+ \\\\+ HO2− The perhydroxyl anion then attacks the activator, forming a peroxy acid: :HO2− \\\\+ RC(O)X → X− \\\\+ RC(O)O2H The overall reaction of TAED (1) with 2 equivalents of hydrogen peroxide gives diacetylethylenediamine (2) and 2 equivalents of peracetic acid (3): center Only the perhydroxyl anion, and not the hydrogen peroxide molecule, reacts with the bleach activator. In aqueous solutions, the hydroxide ion is also present, but owing to the greater nucleophilicity of the perhydroxyl anion, it will react preferentially. Once formed, the peroxy acid can act as a bleach.  Economics  The consumption of bleach activators in 2002 was approximately 105,000 tonnes.G. Reinhardt, To Bleach or Not to Bleach – New Oxygen-Based Bleach Technology, in 5th World Conference on Detergents: Reinventing the Industry: Opportunities and Challenges, edit. A. Cahn, AOCS Publishing, 2003, . Consumption, however, is stagnant or declining due to cost pressures on detergents and the advance of liquid detergent formulations (which contain no bleach and bleach activators). The relatively high cost of conventional bleaching systems restrict their spread in emerging markets, where cold water is used for washing and photobleaching by sunlight is widespread, or the use of sodium hypochlorite solution is common (as in the US). There remains considerable potential in Europe for more active bleach activators due to the significant potential energy savings achievable by washing at lower temperatures, but their higher activity must not be accompanied by greater damage to textile dyes and fibers. In addition to stain bleaching in laundry, the disinfecting and deodorizing effects of bleach/activator combinations also play an important role. Therefore, they are also used in dishwashing detergents and denture cleaners.Clariant Surfactant Division: The Clean and Clever Way of Bleaching, PERACTIVE® (PDF; 885 kB), August 1999.  Examples  Typical bleach activators are essentially N- and O-acyl compounds that form peroxyacids upon perhydrolysis (meaning hydrolysis by hydrogen peroxide from the bleach, persalts). For example, TAED produces in the wash liquor bleach- active peroxyacetic acid or from DOBA peroxydodecanoic acid. In all cases, the activator is chemically reacted according to the degree of contamination in the laundry and thus \\"consumed\\". The literature describes a variety of active N-acyl compounds, such as tetraacetyl glycoluril and other acylated saturated nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as hydantoins, hydrotriazines, diketopiperazines, etc., as well as acylated imides and lactams. A disadvantage of these compounds compared to the standard compound TAED is their usually poorer economic and ecological performance. In addition to the acylated phenol derivatives NOBS, LOBS and DOBA (negatively charged in the aqueous medium), further bleach-active O-acyl compounds are described, for example tetraacetylxylose or pentaacetylglucose. DOBA, commonly used in Japan, is characterized by good biodegradability and greater effect on a number of microorganisms compared to TAED. Both work together synergistically.M. Sajitz, J. Grohmann: Hygiene Effects of Bleach Systems in Laundry Detergents (PDF; 401 kB), SOFW Journal 10-2012. Furthermore, nitriles, such as cyanopyridine and cyanamides, cyanomorpholine and in particular cyanomethyl trialkyl/arylammonium salts are known bleach activators (the latter, the so- called nitrile quats,G. Reinhardt et al., Neue reaktive Bleichaktivatoren – eine Gratwanderung zwischen Bleicheffizienz und Farb-/Faserschädigung, Tenside, Surf. Det., 34 (6), 404-409 (1997) are present in aqueous solution as cations). :\\\\left[\\\\ce{R^2 - \\\\overset{\\\\displaystyle R^1 \\\\atop }\\\\underset{ \\\\atop \\\\displaystyle R^3}{N+}-CH2-CN} \\\\right]\\\\ce{X-} Nitrile quats are active in bleaching even at temperatures around 20 °C and act via peroxoimino acids that are formed intermediately from peroxo compounds. These decompose to the corresponding quaternary amides, which react with the help of hydrogen peroxide to the corresponding, readily biodegradable betaines. A disadvantage of nitrile quats is the poor biodegradability of the original substances and their often pronounced hygroscopicity, which, however, can be reduced by suitable counterions. Other new bleaching systems have been developed, especially for washing at lower temperatures and room temperature and for use in liquid detergent formulations: * New and more active peroxyacids, such as phthalimidoperoxyhexanoic acid (PAP) :PAP Structure * Peracid boosters that form highly reactive intermediates with peracids (such as cyclic sulfonimines as precursors of reactive oxaziridines) or sugar-based ketones that form bleach-active dioxiranes with hydrogen peroxide * Bleach catalysts, which form as stable transition metal complexes (of metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, etc.) with persalts bleaching-active oxygen species even at temperatures below 30 °C. They exceeds the activity of the standard compound TAED by almost 100 times. Such complexes offer enormous economic (lower detergent volume, less packaging, lower transport costs) and environmental benefits (low washing temperature, low wastewater pollution). Particularly interesting are bleaching catalysts of the second generation, which already form bleaching-active species with atmospheric oxygen, i.e. they can mimic the active sites of natural mono- or dioxygenases. However, in 1994, the launch of a first generation manganese complex (\\"persil power flop\\") by Unilever in the UK failed disastrously. As a result, consumers' confidence in bleach catalysts has been shaken on a sustained basis.M. Verrall, Unilever consigns manganese catalyst to the back-burner, Nature, 373, (1995), 181 und Chemistry in action!, 45, , letzte Revision am 17. November 1996. The only use of bleach catalyst/persalt combinations to date (2017) is used in dishwashing detergents.

Personal life and occupation Isaac Newton Walker, generally referred to as Newton Walker, was born on December 18, 1803, in Madison County, Virginia, the son of Merriweather Walker and Elizabeth Kirtley. On May 14, 1834, Walker married Ann Eliza Simms (1814-1904), daughter of Colonel Reuben C. Simms and Frances M. Graves, in Madison County, Virginia. The couple moved to Lewistown, Illinois, in 1835, living on a farm that had been owned by Ossian M. Ross, the founder of Lewistown, who had subsequently moved to Havana, Illinois. The couple had four children: Mary (\\"Mollie;\\" 1835-1923), Henrietta (1839-1928), Robert (1844-1932), and Amelia (1847-1935). Ann Eliza Simms' sisters also moved to Fulton County, and three of them married notable men of the region. Elizabeth M. Simms married David H. Rutledge, brother of Ann Rutledge, who is often considered to have been the sweetheart of Abraham Lincoln; Frances M. Simms married Hon. Lewis W. Ross, a United States Congressman; and Catharine M. Simms married General Leonard F. Ross, a brigadier general in the American Civil War. Newton Walker was engaged in farming in Lewistown. He was also the owner/proprietor of a general store, dealing in merchandise ranging from \\"mackerel to French edging.\\" Military service In 1824, at the age of 21, Walker was appointed a major in the Virginia militia. He was then appointed to the command of the escort of the Marquis de Lafayette during Lafayette's fourth visit to the United States (1824-1825), accompanying him throughout Virginia. Walker continued to be addressed as \\"Major\\" throughout his life and in subsequent historical accounts. Abraham Lincoln connection Sketch of the \\"old\\" (third) Fulton County courthouse, designed by Major Walker, illustrating the outside staircase and the sandstone pillars in front.Shortly after moving to Lewistown, Major Walker was asked to design and supervise the construction of the Fulton County courthouse (actually, the third courthouse in Lewistown, and often referred to as the \\"old Court House\\"). This courthouse was built in 1838 in the Greek Revival style and featured four sandstone columns in front that were quarried from the Spoon River bottom. An outside staircase led to the upper floor. In this building, prominent local attorneys such as Abraham Lincoln, Edward Dickinson Baker and James Shields argued cases of law, and Stephen A. Douglas was a presiding judge. Lincoln and Douglas each gave speeches from between the columns, including Lincoln's famous \\"Back to the Declaration of Independence\\" speech on August 17, 1858. This courthouse burned in a fire of controversial origin on December 13, 1894. After serving as a Fulton County supervisor, Walker was elected as a Whig to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1838, representing Fulton County. Abraham Lincoln was also a member of the Illinois House of Representatives at that time, representing Sangamon County, and was a fellow member of the Whig party. Despite having the same party affiliation, the two men had political differences, and Major Walker in his later years remarked that he used to give Lincoln \\"Hail Columbia.\\" Walker strongly opposed the building of the Illinois Central Railroad, which was a major measure before the state legislature at the time, whereas Lincoln was a staunch supporter of its construction. Nevertheless, the two men became good friends during their time in the legislature. Major Walker recalled entertaining Lincoln by playing the fiddle in the boarding house near the capitol building in Vandalia, Illinois, where Walker was staying. The friendship between Walker and Lincoln continued after Walker left the legislature. Lincoln was a frequent guest in the Walker home in Lewistown, where Major Walker often played his fiddle for Lincoln in return for Lincoln's stories and anecdotes. Lincoln had his last meal in Lewistown in Major Walker's home on August 17, 1858, following Lincoln's address from the courthouse. The next morning, Walker drove Lincoln to Canton, Illinois, in his carriage. According to Walker, the two men discussed politics on the way, including Lincoln's high opinion of William H. Seward, then a U.S. Senator from New York who would later serve as Secretary of State during Lincoln's presidency. Death and legacy \\"Lincoln pillars\\" from the third Fulton County courthouse, now located in the soldiers' memorial in Oak Hill Cemetery.Major Walker died in Lewistown on September 14, 1899. He had been seriously ill with pneumonia earlier that year, and at the time of his death was nearly blind and deaf. Following his death, a number of newspapers throughout the country published his obituary, including The Denver Evening Post and the New York Tribune. Walker was interred in Lewistown's Oak Hill Cemetery, which is slightly southwest of Walker's house. Oak Hill Cemetery is also the location of the \\"Lincoln pillars:\\" two sandstone columns that were retrieved from the burnt remains of the old Fulton County courthouse that Major Walker had designed. Walker is mentioned by name in Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology:< This verse is from \\"The Hill,\\" the introductory section of the work, and it likely refers to Walker having known such men as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Henry Clay when he lived in Virginia. View of the house built by Major Walker with its distinctive corbie gables.The burning of the courthouse that Walker designed is also immortalized in Masters' Spoon River Anthology, in the section \\"Silas Dement:\\" As has been noted, Masters engaged in poetic license regarding the effects of the fire. The columns were made of sandstone, not limestone, and they remained upright after the fire. Major Walker's house, built in 1851, is still standing at 1127 N. Main Street in Lewistown. This -story brick building with hard maple flooring and cherry wood trim was built on property that Walker had bought from Ossian Ross. The house is distinguished by corbie gables at the north and south ends. Blueprints of the house plan and floor plan are available from the Library of Congress as part of the Historic American Buildings Survey collection.

She is remembered as the founder of the first kindergarten in Chicago, Illinois, the founder of the Pestalozzi-Froebel Teachers College, a school centered on training its students for teaching kindergarten in Chicago, and the fourth President of Columbia College of Expression. Biography Bertha Hofer was born December 14, 1862 in Claremont, Iowa to Andreas Franz and Marie (Ruef) Hofer. She spent her childhood there and also in McGregor, Iowa where her father and two brothers became owners and publishers of the McGregor News. When she was twelve she went to Jersey City, New Jersey, where she lived with an aunt and with whom she traveled through Europe, returning to McGregor, Iowa a few years later. She was educated at the National Kindergarten and Elementary College in Chicago and graduated in 1890, then did further graduate studies at the Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus, Berlin in 1895, where she studied under the tutelage of a niece of Friedrich Fröbel, the father of the kindergarten movement. From 1897 until 1898 she studied at the University of Chicago and from 1920 to 1921 she studied at Columbia University, New York. She taught at the Alcott School in Lake Forest, Illinois from 1890 to 1894, and started the first kindergarten at the Chicago Commons Social Settlement where she served as its first director from 1895 to 1904. Out of that grew the present Pestalozzi-Froebel Teachers College of Chicago, which she founded in 1896 and served as president until 1936. In 1896 she married the Reverend Herman Frederick Hegner, a Congregational minister, and in addition to her duties at the school, assisted him in his ministerial work for five years at Bethany Congregational Church in Chicago and for four years in the Congregational Church at Harvey, Illinois. Rev. Hegner then left the church to join his wife in developing the kindergarten college. He retired in 1931. In 1927, the Pestalozzi Froebel Teachers College acquired the Columbia College of Expression which suffered financial setbacks after the death of its founder, Mary A. Blood that same year. The Pestalozzi Froebel Teachers College and Columbia College of Expression operated as separate schools but shared the same faculty, staff, and resources until Columbia College of Expression became its own institution in 1944. She served as president of Columbia College of Expression until 1936 when she retired. She was a member of the International Kindergarten Union, the Illinois State Kindergarten-Primary Association, the Central Country Childhood Education, and Delta Phi Upsilon. She also was author of the monograph, “Home Activities in the Kindergarten,” for U.S. Bureau of Education. She retired from active teaching in 1929 due to illness and she and her husband moved to California in 1931 for her health. In the spring of 1936, she was made president emeritus of Pestalozzi Froebel Teachers College and Columbia College of Expression and her son, Herman Hofer Hegner, became president. The couple returned to Chicago around November 1, 1937 to fulfill her wish to live out her days in the Midwest. She died November 14, 1937 at her Chicago residence.

A mixed commercial and residential area on the east bank of the Little Arkansas River, it is the cultural and historical center of the city’s Hispanic community. History In the 1910s and 1920s, railroad workers recruited from Mexico settled the area along north Broadway Street called “the North End”. The area became Wichita’s first barrio and the seat of the local Mexican American community. The portion east of Broadway became known as El Huarache; the area west of Broadway and north of 21st Street became El Pueblo. In the following decades, immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America continued to settle in the neighborhood, bolstering and broadening its Hispanic character. In recent years, community organizations have formed to both preserve the neighborhood’s heritage and encourage economic development. The area has become well-known locally for its Latin American restaurants and marketplace. Geography El Pueblo is located at (37.73083, -97.34889) at an elevation of .

Z. electra is one of several Zatania species found in the Greater Antilles. History and classification Zatania electra is known from a group of three fossil insects which are entombed in pieces of Dominican amber. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America, and up to southern Mexico. The specimen was collected from an undetermined amber mine in fossil-bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains of northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera, and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene as the age range is only the youngest that it might be. At the time of description, the holotype worker and paraptype male were preserved in the American Museum of Natural History collections while the paratype worker was part of the Museum of Comparative Zoology collections. The trio of ant fossils were first studied by entomologists John Lapolla, Robert Kallal, and Seán Brady with their 2012 type description of the new species being published in the journal Systematic Entomology. The specific epithet electra is derived from the Greek word electra which means \\"amber\\", referencing the species preservation in amber. Description The coloration of both the workers and the males are hard to determine, being either a uniform reddish or dark brown. There are upright standing setae on the gaster, notum, propodeum, head and scapes, but it is hard to determine if fine pubescence is present on the head or antennae. The head is an elongate oval in outline with the rear corners rounded and indistinct. The eyes are small and notably convex while the mandibles have five possible teeth. The basal segment of the antennae, the scape, is elongated, reaching back past the rear margin of the head. The males have a slightly rectangular heads that are wider than long, and dominated on each side by convex large compound eyes. The mandibles have large apical teeth and possibly small denticles, similar to males of the living species Zatania gibberosa. As in the workers, the antennae have elongated scapes that extend beyond the rear margin of the head and have short setae on them. The genitalia are similar to the species Zatania cisipa and Zatania gloriosa, having narrow long parameres.

All parts of the plant are poisonous. The green hellebore was one of the many plants first described by Linnaeus in volume one of his 1753 tenth edition of his Species Plantarum. The species name is the Latin adjective viridis, \\"green\\". Two subspecies are recognised, subspecies viridis from Central Europe and the maritime Alps, and subspecies occidentalis from western Europe including England. Other common names recorded include bastard hellebore, bear's foot and boar's foot. Growing to around 60 cm (2 ft) high, the green hellebore is a perennial plant. The flowers appear in spring (February to April). They have five large green oval sepals with pointed tips, and seven to twelve much smaller petals. The roots are rhizomatous. Subspecies viridis has flowers of 4–5 cm diameter and leaves covered with fine hairs, while the flowers of subspecies occidentalis are smaller (3–4 cm diameter) and its leaves are smooth. The green hellebore is found in Western and Central Europe, east to eastern Austria and south to northern Italy. It grows on limestone and chalk-based soils in the south of England. The green hellebore has become weedy in North America, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and northern Germany. Consumption of any part of the plant can lead to severe vomiting and seizures. Its purgative properties meant that it was traditionally used as a folk remedy to treat worms in children and topically to treat lice.

Early life Born at Geraardsbergen, Hauchin studied philosophy at Leuven University and theology at the University of Dole and the University of Douai, where he graduated Licentiate of Sacred Theology. He was chaplain to William the Silent and in 1571 dean of Brussels minster. On 23 February 1580, the city council of Brussels (then Calvinist) ordered him, as vicar general of the diocese, to publish a decree suppressing feastdays of saints, which he refused to do. On 7 May 1580 he took part in a public disputation with Calvinists about the nature of the Eucharist. After other clashes with the civic authorities, he spent three months in prison. Archbishop On 30 October 1583 he was consecrated archbishop of Mechelen at Tournai (Mechelen itself then being in rebel hands). He entered his see in 1585. On 8 November 1585, the remnants of the relics of St Rumbold of Mechelen, saved from the desecration of the cathedral during the period of Calvinist rule, were solemnly deposited in the saint's tomb in the cathedral. In 1588 he had the Pastorale Mechliniense, commissioned from the theologians of Leuven University, published by Christophe Plantin in Antwerp. This was a handbook of the rites to be used by priests throughout the ecclesiastical province. Archbishop Hauchin died on 5 January 1589.

It may also refer to additional civil rights that are taken away upon conviction, such as holding public office and serving on a jury. In the United States, the voting rights of people convicted of a felony vary from state to state. In most states, the right to vote is automatically or eventually restored upon the completion of one’s sentence. In three states – Florida, Kentucky and Iowa – all individuals convicted of felonies lose their voting rights permanently, and they must directly petition the government to get them back. Critics of these voting prohibitions argue that voting is an unalienable right and should not be taken away from citizens who have repaid their debt to society. Background Compared to other nations, the United States is very strict with regard to denying the right to vote to people with prior felony convictions.\\"Felon voting laws to disenfranchise historic number of Americans in 2012\\", The Guardian, July 13, 2012 Under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, states are able to make their own rules on restricting the right to vote based on criminal convictions. It is estimated that there are 5.85 million people in the United States who cannot vote due to felony convictions,\\"U.S. Felony Disenfranchisement Laws By State\\", Sentencing Project including 2.6 million who have completed their sentences but are disenfranchised in states with the most restrictive policies.\\"Felony Disenfranchisement and the 2014 Mid-Term Elections\\", Sentencing Project, Oct. 2, 2014 This accounts for approximately 2.5 percent of the eligible voter population, and almost eight percent of the African- American eligible voter population.\\"Felon voting laws to disenfranchise historic number of Americans in 2012\\", The Guardian, July 13, 2012 Felony Disenfranchisement By State See “Felony Disenfranchisement, Contemporary Practice By Country, United States” Advocacy for Rights Restoration Several groups in the U.S. are active in the movement to restore voting rights to people with prior felony convictions, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Voting and Democracy, Prison Policy Initiative, Advancement Project, Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, and the Sentencing Project. Among these groups and others, core reasons for ending felony disenfranchisement and restoring voting rights to people with prior felony convictions include: =Felony disenfranchisement is used to suppress the African-American vote= Although it has existed since colonial times, voter disenfranchisement boomed after the Civil War. Afraid of large black populations finally being able to vote, Southern states looked for ways to penalize African-American citizens and deny them the vote, both through Jim Crow laws and felony disenfranchisement.\\"Felon Disenfranchisement\\", Fair Vote =Racial disparities= Due to racial disparities in the U.S. prison system, African Americans and Latinos are overrepresented in the incarcerated population. Thus, more African Americans and Latinos are often subject to felony disenfranchisement. While African Americans are only 13 percent of U.S. population, they make up 38 percent of the prison population. Latinos account for about 15 percent of the U.S. population and make up 20 percent of Americans in prison.\\"Felon Disenfranchisement and the Fight for Universal Suffrage\\", Social Work: Oxford Journals, 2011 It is estimated that one out of every 13 African Americans is unable to vote due to prior felony convictions in states where felony disenfranchisement is prevalent.\\"Felony Disenfranchisement and the 2014 Mid-Term Elections\\", Sentencing Project, Oct. 2, 2014 =Repatriation= Those in support of rights restoration argue that, once someone has paid their debt to society, their punishment should end. That should also include the ending of voting restrictions. Advocates contend that this is crucial for people with prior felony convictions to fully reintegrate back into society. “Once a citizen has done time and repaid his or her debt to society, they should not be deprived of their fundamental right to vote,” said Judith Browne-Dianis, co-director of Advancement Project.\\"Advancement Project Appaulds Virginia Governor for Expanding Voting Rights\\", Advancement Project, April 18, 2014 Studies have shown that former incarcerated people who are able to vote, find work and educate themselves are less likely to reoffend and return to the penal system.\\"Florida Parole Commission Report\\", Florida Parole Commission, June 30, 2011 2014 Changes in Rights Restoration In 2014, Virginia Gov.

The movie documents the first quest \\"to visit and document every region Marco Polo claimed to have traveled\\" using only land and sea methods of transportation. Mike Hale of The New York Times writes that the documentary includes how Belliveau and O'Donnell \\"encountered Mongol horsemen and hostile Chinese security officers and survived a firefight between Afghan factions. In the spirit of Polo's journey -- and to prove a point regarding the authenticity of his account -- they disdained airplanes, traveling by foot, on horses and camels and by jeep, boat and train.\\" A text by the same name as the video, In the Footsteps of Marco Polo, written by Belliveau and O'Donnell, and published by Rowman & Littlefield, serves as a companion to the documentary film. In the Footsteps of Marco Polo has been used by Belliveau to create a unique interdisciplinary educational curriculum that he presents at schools and libraries across the United States and internationally.  Plot  In The Footsteps of Marco Polo begins by discussing how in the 13th century A.D., a book was written \\"that would change the course of history\\"—the author was Marco Polo, who wrote about his travels in China, Persia, Tatarstan and India. Denis Belliveau and Francis O'Donnell, of Queens, New York, sought to retrace the entire 25,000 mile route of Marco Polo, eschewing aircraft and \\"going only by land or sea\\", even making a pact to return either “dead or successful”. Their main goal was to prove the validity of Marco Polo's account by capturing images of what Polo described in his Book of the Marvels of the World, or also known as, The Travels of Marco Polo. The pair started out in Venice, Italy and then sailed to Israel, where in Jerusalem they obtained holy oil from Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site of Jesus' burial, during the Eastern Orthodox Christian celebration of Easter, as Marco Polo had. Belliveau and O'Donnell then sailed to Turkey, landing in Ayaş, a small fishing village, although in Polo's time it was a large port. The duo made appearances in several local newspapers, which opened up doors with the local population. Denis and Francis then tried to enter Iran but were prohibited from doing so by the Iranian government. As a result, they picked up the trail traveled by Marco Polo's father, Niccolo and his uncle Maffeo, to Bukhara, hoping to visit Iran on the way back. The Polo brothers had opened up the land route to China, known as the Silk Road years before Polo. In Uzbekistan the two were required to have a visa for every city that they visited. Belliveau and O'Donnell, however, initially faced difficulty from the Federal Security Service (the successor of the Soviet KGB) in crossing the Friendship Bridge into Afghanistan, but were able to do so after waiting approximately three weeks, forging their visas and paying a $100 bribe. The two noticed the stark difference between this former Republic of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan—the lack of roads, goods and electricity. To get across Afghanistan, Belliveau and O'Donnell were inspired by a plan implemented by Marco Polo: Kublai Khan had provided Polo and his companions with a golden tablet or paiza on which was written that they should be given all the \\"lodging they might need and horses to escort them from one land to another.\\" The American adventurers similarly received a letter from a comrade of an Afghan warlord that enabled them to obtain twenty-five heavily armed bodyguards. While traveling to Balkh, the group was ambushed and held captive by ethnic Hazaras, the direct descendants of a tribe that attacked Polo's caravan. Denis and Francis then made their way to the Wakhan Corridor in far northeastern Afghanistan. The narrow corridor has been described by the two modern explorers as being the jewel in the crown of their achievement. The leader of the Wakhi people, a living remnant of the days of feudal lords, Shah Sayid Muhammad Ishmael, told the travelers that they were the first Westerners to traverse the legendary corridor in a generation. Belliveau and O'Donnell then crossed the Pamirs into Tajikistan on horseback, passing structures made of sheep horns (ovis poli), that guided the sojourners along the snowy trails just as described by Marco Polo and dictated by local custom. The first city that the duo encountered in China was Kashgar, where they resupplied their caravan for an arduous six week horse and camelback crossing of the Taklamakan Desert. In 1994, when they finally arrived in Dunhuang, a city in the Gansu Province, Belliveau and O’Donnell treated themselves to their first shower and hotel room after months of arduous travel. Marco Polo had written about the Reclining Buddha in Zhangye, which the pair dutifully recorded. When traveling to Mongolia, they lived in “circular houses covered in felt” called gers. They ceremoniously drank fermented mares milk called airag and partook of other various milk products used in the diet of the nomadic people residing there. The journeyers traveled throughout China visiting close to 200 places described by Polo, including Yunnan and Tibet. Finally, from Hong Kong in August 1994, they sailed on a container ship to Sumatra, where they lived with the Mentawai people and O'Donnell received a tribal tattoo, according to local tradition. They then sailed to Sri Lanka, known as Ceylon to Polo, and then at the beginning of November, they arrived in the Indian city of Madras, where they set off into the Indian subcontinent, documenting all Polo had correctly noted, including the ancient practice of astrology. They then traveled from India to Iran, called Persia by Polo. Despite the devastating refusal of entry into Iran at the start of their journey the two adventurers were finally granted a one-month visa for entry, and told they were the first Americans to receive this freedom of passage since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Belliveau and O'Donnell were thankful for the incredible hospitality of the people they met there. When the duo arrived back in Venice in March 1995 they were sailed down the grand canal in a royal regatta of gondolas, landing them in St Mark's Square, where the church bells of St Mark's Basilica rang in honor of their return. At a celebratory banquet, the Venetian mayor presented them with the keys to the city and the next morning personally walked them into the Biblioteca Nazionale to view Marco Polo's last will and testament, which they had been denied access to before they left on their epic journey.

The conservation and restoration of time-based media art is a complex undertaking within the field of conservation that includes understanding both physical and digital conservation methods; there are many facets of time-based media conservation. Its major aim is to detect and monitor short and long-term changes that an artwork may undergo in response to its environment, technological developments, exhibition-design, or technicians' preferences.Guggenheim Museum (n.d.). Establishing New Practices. Retrieved from Time-based media art Time-based media is any media that takes time to view, in other words it has a dimension of duration (e.g. five minutes and 10 seconds). Time based-media also contains a technology component, as hardware will be required to view the work.Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.). Time-Based Media Art at the Smithsonian. Retrieved from Time-based media art may be made on a physical media, such as film stock, by a digital means, or a combination of the two. Examples of time- based media include artworks and installations composed of video, audio, film, slides, software-based art or other forms of technology-based artworks. A time-based media artwork will consist of the medium- for example a video tape or DVD, the equipment it is played on, and any additional installation components.Iles, Chrissie and Huldisch, Henriette (2005). Keeping Time: On Collecting Film and Video Art in the Museum. In Collecting the New. Altshuler, Bruce (Ed.) NJ: Princeton University Press. Works containing video and/or audio may at times be referred to as \\"4D\\" (four-dimensional), referencing time as the fourth dimension, in addition to the other three dimensions in artwork: length, width, and height. Some time-based media works may overlap, in some respects, with New Media Art. Other terms that may also refer to time-based media art include \\"variable media art\\", \\"electronic art\\", \\"moving-image art\\", \\"technology-based art\\" and \\"time-based media\\". Time-based media collections may be housed in libraries and archives, but time-based media art collections are typically housed in museums, where film and video are collected as fine art and where the collection is typically smaller than in a library or archive. Museums are more likely to collect video and installation-specific equipment as well. The majority of time-based media art is completed on noncommercial films stocks, such as 8mm or 16mm, on videotape, or via a digital means. Time-based media art is differentiated from professional or commercial film-making.  Preservation and conservation strategies  Guidelines for collecting and preserving time-based media art are still evolving, and standards have not yet been reached. Generally though, video and film must be looked at differently because of the difference between the two mediums, despite having the similarity of being recorded in time. Thus procedures for preservation and conservation will vary between the mediums. Video is a coded system, the information stored on the magnetic or digital tape can be retrieved only with a specific electronic playback device; the images on the film strip, however, are legible on their own, though the projector provides the only means by which they can be viewed. When collecting film and video art, a master and at least one sub-master should be obtained. In some cases, and exhibition copy will be obtained as well, in other cases it will be copied by the museum. The Guggenheim Museum provides preservation models for Analog Standard Definition Video, Digital Standard Definition Video, and High Definition Video. Some conservators recommend that sub-masters be in digital format, as analog tape suffers from generation loss, each time it is duplicated. Digital formats can suffer from generation loss as well, but it can be avoided through good practice. The sub-master will be used to make new copies of the work and the format of the sub-master needs to be updated when it nears obsolescence. Obsolescence is of particular concern to time- based media art conservationists as many artworks are tied to hardware which is no longer manufactured or supported. File formats reaching obsolescence are another concern, as operating systems change and old formats are replaced by newer ones. Fortunately there are some methods in place to help prevent the total loss of time-based media artworks. = Preventive measures = The protection against physical loss, technological obsolescence, and digital loss of the file are important aspects of a holistic approach to preservation strategies. Measures must also be taken against environmental factors, such as humidity and pests to ensure the long-term preservation of any physical media. Integrated pest management is an important part of any museum preventive conservation plan. Preventive measures do not stop deterioration fully; they merely prolong the time it takes for the media to deteriorate. Some media, like certain film stocks, are more stable than others, and some media, such as magnetic videotape, are potentially unstable, requiring different conservation approaches.  Storage and maintenance of physical objects  Good storage practices help ensure the long life of an artwork and should be incorporated into a museum's conservation strategy. Storage practices vary by media, so a museum will need to employ a range of storage options to best care for their time-based media art collections. A variety of physical media, such as film, tape, and disks must be stored properly to prevent physical loss. Prevention is the best measure of protection against loss. How media is stored will be dependent on the type of media it is, film has different considerations than disks or videotape. Generally, time-based media storage will require cool temperatures and low humidity.IMAP. (2009). Preservation 101. Retrieved from www.imappreserve.org/pres_101/index.html Film - Film reels are typically stored in their metal or plastic canisters, laid flat, and stacked on top of each other. Film must be stored in a climate-controlled room due to its susceptibility to heat and humidity. Film may also have additional special storage considerations, which may involve low temperature freezes to retard further damage.National Park Service (n.d.) Cold Storage. Retrieved from How stable the film is depends largely on the type of stock, but film, if well taken care of, is generally able to last for long periods of time. Film has been made on a variety of materials, including nitrate-based stock (see: Nitrocellulose) and acetate-based stocks, and polyester-backed film, each have their own considerations. Nitrate film must be handled carefully, as it is highly flammable; cellulose acetate film stocks are at risk of vinegar syndrome, whereas polyester-backed films are not. Film is stored in a colder environment than other time-based media, and different types of film have different optimum storage temperatures. \\"Color film should be stored at the coldest possible temperature to reduce fading,\\" 0-30 degrees Fahrenheit, while black and white film can be stored at a temperature of 25-50 degrees Fahrenheit. Magnetic videotape- Magnetic videotape was never meant to last, and often has a short life (often only a few decades) especially if exposed to warm or humid conditions. Videotapes, should be stored in upright, under cool, dry, dust-free conditions. Videotapes may be stored in polypropylene cases, but without paper inside the cases and \\"magnetic media should never be stored at temperatures below 46 degrees Fahrenheit\\". Magnetic media should also be kept away from magnetic sources, which could demagnetize them. Optical digital media - DVDs and CDs are another media that will need storage space. Optical media should be stored in hard plastic jewel cases or other inert plastic containers; avoid storage in plastic sleeves. DVDs and CDs can be stored at temperatures ranging from 62-68 degrees Fahrenheit, with 33-45% relative humidity, but cooler temperatures are recommended to ensure a longer life. Playback devices - Because time-based media is dependent on technology to view it, playback devices must also be stored. There are some devices that will apply to many works in a time-based media art collection, but specific types of technological devices may be required for the art or preferred by the artist. Maintaining the technology that the time-based media art is played on is one conservation strategy, and what is stored depends on the device. Consumer products, for example, are not meant for repeated viewing on such a large scale and are usually not expected to have a long enough life to maintain the device well into the future. Due to rapid changes in video technology and the high cost of maintaining and storing equipment, storage and maintenance of some playback devices may not practical for a museum as a primary strategy. Museums do at times need to store obsolete technology though, such as VCRs, old computers, video game systems, etc., particularly if they have been customized for the artwork by the artist. In these cases, conservation strategies could included acquiring spare parts (early on in the acquisition process, before the technology goes out of manufacture), making new components if necessary, and/or \\"recreating significant features by inexact substitution\\" (in order words, using the \\"best match\\").Laurenson, Pip (2005). The Management of Display Equipment in Time-based Media Installations. Tate Papers. Retrieved from Until better solutions are found, keeping and maintaining old technology will remain a necessity. Unlike video equipment, film equipment is far more stable and museums may be more likely to conserve the equipment along with the media because there is less upkeep and film equipment does not need constant replacement due to obsolescence. A working projector will always run film. Technological devices should be stored in a clean, climate controlled environment, as humidity can be damaging to electronic components. Digital preservation Digital files must be preserved and stored as well, otherwise they also risk degradation. Due to the large amounts of storage space that may be needed, museums may want to employ the use of a digital repository that offers digital preservation as a service. Repositories will keep the digital file stored, perform migration (moving the old format to a new, usable format), and typically offer some guarantee of preservation for a specified period of time. Artists may also wish to seek out a repository for storage of their digital artwork. Rhizome's Artbase is an online archive that seeks to preserve contemporary digital art. Part of digital media storage is to ensure continuity of the digital file through format changes, thus migration becomes a likely strategy. Some conservators recommend that medium upgrades take place at least every five years, making duplication a main strategy of digital conservation. Time-based media art that either has an inherent digital component (i.e. a born-digital work) or has been digitized will have the need to be preserved digitally. While this work may not entirely be completed by the conservator, conservators will be aware of the methods used to preserve digital media. The Variable Media Approach, a strategy that comes from the Guggenheim Museum's Variable Media Initiative research, offers a way in which to define the artwork \\"independently from medium so that the work can be translated once its current medium is obsolete.\\" Variable Media Network (n.d.) Retrieved from http://www.variablemedia.net/e/welcome.html It is a methodology that approaches a work as independent from its media, so that is may be thought of as a behavior and not something tied to its hardware.Depocas, Alain (2003). The Guggenheim Museum and the Daniel Langlois Foundation: The Variable Media Network. Retrieved from http://www.fondation- langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=98 This process looks to preserve works despite the uncertainty of technological developments of the future. By making a work independent from its medium, the Variable Media Approach hopes to ensure the life of the artwork well into the future, beyond the obsolescence of all current technology. The approach encompasses four aspects: Storage, Migration, Emulation, and Reinterpretation.Guggenheim Museum. (n.d.). The Variable Media Initiative. Retrieved from Storage is the most basic strategy. Migration simply means to copy the files to new storage media. With migration, conservators preserve the original aspects of the work. Emulation is not as straight forward, it involves some amount of interpretation and is more an imitation of the original work. In the context of digital media, \\"emulation offers a powerful technique for running an out-of-date computer on a contemporary one\\". Reinterpretation is the most radical strategy, as it involves recreation of the work. When formats or storage media become obsolete, \\"time-based art is typically migrated to newer, accessible platforms\\".Smithsonian Institution (2010). Collaborations in Conserving Time- Based Art: A Summary of Discussion Group Sessions of a Colloquium. Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved from This will mean updating the file format so that it is playable on newer technology. In some cases, this may not be in keeping with the artist's wishes, as he or she may wish to continue viewings of their work in a specific format. If the format is integral to the work, then upkeep becomes more involved and maintaining the usability of the artwork against the odds of obsolescence in both media and technology becomes a major preservation challenge. For this reason, it is encouraged that artists allow for some flexibility in future iterations of the artwork. = Examination and documentation = Examining and documenting the physical state of an object is an important part of understanding its overall condition. The process of examination and documentation will alert conservators to any problems that need immediate or future attention.  Physical examination  The physical components of time-based media art must be examined in order to understand their physical condition. With film, physical examination will identify a variety of deterioration processes, such as vinegar syndrome in safety films or color dye fading in color film stock. It is important to identify these early, not only to try to prevent further deterioration, but to intervene with treatment or to make a duplicate copy. Without the examination process, time-based media may degrade beyond repair and possibly be lost entirely.  Condition assessments  Condition assessments are procedures that are carried out by conservators or other collections care professionals to document the overall condition of an object. These assessments are necessary for all the types of media and technology associated with time-based media art. The assessments stay in the object's file and give future conservators insight into the object's life history. They are performed upon intake of an object into a collection, before and after the object goes on loan, and as necessary. They make note of any physical issues that may be present, such as tears, stains, scratches, or other damage. Film is especially vulnerable to tears and warping, while DVDs and CDs scratch easily. Other issues cannot be seen, such as demagnetization of tape, and require other methods of examination. After the condition of a physical object is assessed, the examiner may recommend treatment if necessary. Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) recommends taking certain steps to assessing the condition of time-based media: 1) Examine the container - damage on the outside of a container could mean damaged media inside the container. Cases should be examined for dents, stains, and molds or fungus. 2) Check for odor - it may be an indication that the media has deteriorated. Vinegar syndrome emits a vinegar-like odor when present. If media smells musty it could indicate magnetic decay. 3) Examine the surface and the edges - look for powder, dust, dirt and residue, they may indicate deterioration or surface contamination. 4) Identify the format - Knowing the media format is important to proper handling. 5) Play the tape - In some cases it may be necessary to play the tape, a process that if not handled carefully could damage the media. Playback can detect \\"noise, color shift, distortion, and timing flaws\\".  Further documentation  Because time-based media has a fourth dimension of time, not present in other types of works, additional documentation to understand the allographic nature of the media may be required, and is recommended. Such documents include the Guggenheim Museum's Iteration Report or Variable Media Questionnaire (VMQ), developed as part of the Variable Media Initiative. The reports collect information about the nature or behavior of the art, so that future curators and conservators can understand it from an artistic and behavioral point of view, as well as a technical point of view. This allows museum professionals to recreate, or make a new iteration, of a particular time-based media artwork. The most common behaviors assigned to time-based media art are interactive, encoded, and networked. Because a new viewing of a time-based work can only be an iteration, by making each viewing as close to the artist's desires as possible, the nature of the artwork is conserved. The reports collect information such as how to install the artwork, what the space (walls, floors, ceilings, additions) should look like and how it should be arranged, how equipment should be installed, and the technical set-up of the work. Each iteration will be dependent on the physical constraints of the room, so that no two installations will be completely alike. In the VMQ, an artist can order his or her preferences for technical specifications and whether any technology other than the original is allowed to be used. The reports are an important means of understanding how to set-up a work and make it as close to the prior iterations as possible. =Research= The history of time-based media art is not long, compared to more traditional forms of art. Much research is still needed in this area in order to move toward and achieve standardizations of practice. Research projects Two major research projects into time-based media include the Guggenheim Museum's Variable Media Initiative and the Smithsonian's Time Based Media and Digital Art Working Group. =The Variable Media Initiative= The Guggenheim Museum's research has led to the Variable Media Approach, and the Variable Media Questionnaire, a tool of the Variable Media Approach. Beginning in 1999, the Variable Media Initiative is one of the museum's most well-known research initiatives. Originally funded by a grant from the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology in Montreal, Canada, the Variable Media Network (VMN) has grown into a group of international institutions and consultants, including University of Maine, the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archives, Franklin Furnace, Rhizome.org, and Performance Art Festival & Archives It defined a new approach to documenting contemporary artworks dependent on media, by defining the media as \\"variable\\", the artwork becomes untangled from its material aspects, allowing preservation of the work through time without loss of meaning. *Published works include: Permanence Through Change: The Variable Media Approach. *Exhibitions and case studies: Seeing Double: Emulation in Theory and Practice, Spring 2004. *Symposiums: Preserving the Immaterial: A Conference on Variable Media, March 2001.

The group includes staff from across the Smithsonian Institution and was developed to work with the Smithsonian's collection, but also to share the information and seek external ties.

TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTS IN ART: Conserving Software-Based Artworks, January 2014. =Treatment= Treatment methods of time-based media art include a mix of both traditional and new techniques. Not all of the work will fall to a conservator, because of the highly technical nature of some of the devices, \\"certain tasks have to be delegated to respective experts, such as media technicians, video engineers, programmers, film-lab professionals, service technicians, and similar specialists\\".Guggenheim Museum (n.d.). Establishing New Practices. Retrieved from The maintenance of the technology is an important part of the conservation process for many works of art. Treatment of physical objects Time-based media conservators will treat and maintain a variety of objects, including film reels, projectors, computers, TVs, and other types of technology. In cases of videotape and DVDs, migration of the work to another format will more likely be the case. Because there are so many types of media that support time-based media art, treatment of each type will vary. While the prevention of physical film degradation is important, the preservationist's main goal is to preserve the image, as the film itself often decays rapidly and beyond repair (see: Film Preservation). Film preservation falls into several categories: conservation, which is the \\"protection of the original film artifact\\"; duplication, which is the \\"making of a surrogate copy\\"; and restoration, which is the attempt to \\"reconstruct a specific version of a film\\", which will include piecing together footage from all known sources.National Film Preservation Foundation (2004). The Film Preservation Guide: The basics for archives, libraries, and museums. San Francisco, CA: National Film Preservation Foundation. Film restoration will involve the use of duplicates, not the originals. Duplication of an original to a new and stable film stock (a continuing process, as eventually the duplicate will degrade) and repairing tears in the physical film are common types of treatment for film stock. There is a growing need to understand digital processes of duplication as well. While much duplication still requires that film be moved to a new and stable film stock, digital has been advancing as a method of duplication, though many argue it should not be used alone as digital files are unproven in the long term (see again: Film Preservation). In the case of technology, treatment will look more like maintenance and will be required to keep the object functional. Obsolescence of technology is a major concern as discussed under Storage and Maintenance of Physical Objects. = Education and outreach = Access Access is the process through which artistic content is shared with public, such as providing researchers access to materials for scholarly work. Museums will more likely lend copies for study purposes, though study of the original may be warranted at times. Community outreach Festivals such as Portland's Time-Based Art Festival take place annually and are reflective of the general acceptance of time-based media art outside the walls of the museum.  Education and training =Educational programs= There are few conservation programs specific to time-based media art, but the Bern University of the Arts in Bern, Switzerland offers an MA program for the Conservation of Modern Materials and Media. Programs that include some aspect of time-based media include The Selznick Graduate Program in Film and Media Preservation at the University of Rochester in New York and New York University's Moving Image Archiving and Preservation program. At UCLA, there is an M.A. in Moving Image Archive Studies. The latter three programs deal primarily in archival film preservation, which requires specialized training in a variety of film stocks. A film preservationist must be knowledgeable about and trained to work with many types of film. In a museum context, the film is more likely to be consumer sizes like super 8mm and 16mm, not the 35mm that is used in commercial film making, as they are the preferred medium of artist and amateur filmmakers. Typically, the 35mm stock will be more prevalent in a library or archive. Because of the few formalized education programs in time-based media, most conservators of time-based media art make their way there through a professional path. =Professional training= Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) is a non-profit organization that offers training to professionals within time-based media art preservation to include workshops, cataloging training, public programs, one-on-one assessments, and technical assistance.Independent Media Arts Preservation (n.d.).

Early and personal life Birth CertFiona Plunkett was the daughter of George Noble Plunkett and Josephine Cranny and grew up on 26 Upper Fitzwilliam Street. She was the youngest of four daughters: Philomena, Mary, and Geraldine Plunkett. She also had three brothers, Jack, George and Joseph Plunkett (the latter two being signatories and participants in the Easter Rising proclamation). Her religious status was determined by her father's, who was a Roman Catholic. This would also influence where she was to later attend school to receive her education. Her father was the curator of the National Museum of Ireland, however he was forced to step down and exiled to Oxford following both his and his children's actions during the 1916 Rising. He later became a politician, being a member of the then newly formed Sinn Féin party. Although her family was heavily involved with politics, Plunkett only established her political career at the age of 26 during the Irish Civil War. Plunkett was engaged three times but never married, and died at the age of 81, in 1977 in a Dublin hospital of natural causes. Education 26 Fitzwilliam Street Upper Dublin Opportunity for the Plunkett daughters was not as high as that of their brothers. Plunkett would sit in her brothers' lessons, in an attempt to receive an education. In her later years she attended the Sacred Heart Convent School situated at Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, Ireland - however she only spent a few terms there. Later on in her academic life, she attended a catholic girls school, Mount Anville Secondary School. Plunkett had access to a large collection of books owned by her father, which allowed her to read on various topics. Political views Plunkett's political beliefs were largely influenced by other members of her family, particularly her father and three brothers. She had Irish republican ideals, and these beliefs would influence her actions throughout much of her life. As a young girl, she was part of the group of women that provided food relief to the workers effected by the 1913 Dublin Lock-out. In 1916, she was a member of the Irish Republican Women's Paramilitary, Cumann na mBan, and indirectly participated in the 1916 Easter Rising as an organiser. Joseph would later be executed for his role in the Rising while Oliver and Jack were both imprisoned in England for one year. In 1917 Cumann na mBan was beginning a regrouping period, memberships increased as did the membership of Sinn Féin. In this period, new branches of Cumann na mBan were being created and old ones were reformed. Nine executives were chosen to represent Cumann na mBan; Plunkett herself, Nancy O'Rahilly and her daughter, Margaret Pearse, Áine Ceannt, Kathleen Clarke, Nancy Wyse Power, Mary McSwiney and Madge Daly.Matthews, Ann (1995). Cumann na mBan 1913-26: Redressing the Balance. (National University of Ireland, St. Patricks Coleege, Maynooth) Plunkett was a member of the group of women left behind after the Easter Rising, that included mothers, sisters, wives and daughters. As a group they perceived themselves as being sidelined, with Plunkett resisting the move to amalgamate many of the groups into Sinn Féin in the period following the Rising. She remained particularly close to her sister-in-law Grace Gifford. In 1926, Plunkett herself would be tried and imprisoned for her involvement in the raid of the home of Edward Levi. This raid was part of an ongoing campaign against Dublin moneylenders at the time. Three IRA members, allegedly armed, had demanded that Levi hand over all of his account books. Plunkett, Domhall O'Donohue and Mick Price were charged for assisting in the formation of an illegal military force and possession of arms, ammunition and treasonable documents. In 1942, she stood onto a platform during a 1916 Commemoration at Arbor Hill church, condemning the Irish government's treatment of political prisoners (her brother Jack being one such prisoner at the time, on hunger strike in Arbor Hill Prison, next to the church) under Éamon de Valera's authority. Following her departure from the event, other demonstrators are known to have continued in her place. All references to the \\"Plunkett Incident\\" would be censored in the Irish Press in the following days. In her later years, Plunkett remained an active Republican. In 1971 her letter to the editor of The Irish Times criticised the truce in Northern Ireland at the time, urging the Irish people to stand up against \\"British Domination\\". She would go on to say that any celebrations for attained peace while Britain remains in Ireland is but a \\"hollow mockery\\" of the Irish people. In 1976, she was prosecuted for her participation in a banned commemoration of the 1916 Rising at the GPO. Death and legacy Plunkett died on 14 July 1977 at the age of 81. She was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, in a family grave at the Republican plot. Plunketts's legacy and life is recounted in the book \\"All in Blood: a memoir\\" written by her older sister Geraldine Dillon who tells the story of living with the Plunkett family.Dillon, Geraldine Plunkett (1891-1986).

She was the daughter of the merchant Nils Holmlund and Johanna Helena Torsslow. In 1849, she became one of four females accepted as students at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm: the other three being Lea Ahlborn, Agnes Börjesson and Amalia Lindegren. Between 1851 and 1854, she was a student of the genre painter Vautier in Paris. On her return to Stockholm, she founded and managed an art studio for female students. From 1858, she spent her time divided between Sweden and Düsseldorf from Germany. Jeanette Möller has been characterized as a genre painter. Her more known works include Shakespeare i sin studerkammare (Shakespeare in his chamber), Läsande munk (Reading monk), Sömmerska insomnad vid sitt arbete (Seamstress asleep at her work), Meditation and Flicka som matar höns (Girl feeding hens). Jeanette Möller was an agré of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts from 1861. Personal life In 1858 Jeanette Möller moved to Düsseldorf, Germany. In 1860, she married Norwegian painter Niels Bjørnson Møller (1827-1887). Their son Björn Möller was born during 1862. Their daughter Johanna Björnson Möller (born 1870) was married to economist Gustav Cassel (1866–1945). Jeanette Möller died during 1872 and Niels Möller died during 1887, both in Düsseldorf.

Machine tools  As a Standards Development Organization, ASME continues to develop and maintains nearly 600 codes and standards in a wide range of disciplines including pressure technology, nuclear plants, elevators / escalators, construction, engineering design, and performance testing. Machine Tool standards are developed and maintained by ASME B5 Committee, which operates under ASME's Board on Standardization and Testing. The B5 Standards Committee currently meets once a year in various locations throughout the United States. The meeting is generally held in November and is open to the public. The B5 Technical Committees usually meet in conjunction with the B5 Standards Committee. Some B5 Technical Committees also meet separately in different locations throughout the year. The B5 Standards Committee and its Technical Committees are composed of experts in the field of machine tools. Members of the B5 Standards Committee are classified in the following interest classes: Producer/Manufacturer, Regulatory, Services, General Interest, and User. The B5 Committee works on writing new ASME American National Standards, and revising current ASME B5 and B94 standards. The B5 Standards Committee operates under procedures of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Turn of the Century Machine Shop  History  The celebration of the 100th meeting in 2022 will mark the 100th consecutive year the ASME B5 committee has met. The following historical information marks only the beginning stages of copious collaborative work and continuous publication, review, and revision of ASME B5 Standards. On May 13, 1914, the ASME Committee on Meetings, Subcommittee on Machine Shop Practice began discussion on standardization of machine shop practices. It wasn't until September 1922 under the procedure of American Standards Association, the B5 committee was organized as a committee dedicated to machine tools. B5 was sponsored by the National Machine Tool Builders’ Association, the Society of Automotive Engineers, Metal Cutting Tool Institute, and The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. On December 2, 1937, the standard for Adjustable Adapters for Multiple Spindle Drilling Heads this standard was approved by the American Standards Association and designated as American Standard (ASA B5.11-1937). Work on the standardization of T-slots started in 1924 and a tentative standard was published in 1927. The first official American Standard for T-slots came in 1941. B5 Technical Committee No. 11 was organized in New York on December 4, 1928, and B5 Technical Committee No. 4 on Spindle Noses was organized on December 5, 1928. These two committees worked in close cooperation with each other and with manufacturers and users of engine lathes, turret lathes and automatic lathes in developing standards for spindle noses and chucks. B5 Technical Committee No. 3 on the Standardization of Machine Tapers was appointed in August, 1926, and held its organization meeting in September, 1926, in New Haven, Conn. Three American tapers then in use, the Brown & Sharpe (1860), Morse (1862), and Jarno (1889), and the taper series adopted by William Sellers & Co.(1862) were combined into a compromise standard series which contained twenty-two (22) self-holding taper sizes. The first edition of the Spindle Noses and Tool Shanks for Milling Machines standard, known as B5.18-1943, resulted from intensive effort dating back to 1926 by a special group of milling machine manufacturers. The effort to establish an American standard for Ball Screws began in July 1971 out of a need to obtain a consensus opinion relative to proposals for standardization of ball screw assemblies within the ISO/TC39 sub-committee Working Group 7. Out of this, the subcommittee TC43 was organized with members representing manufacturers, users of ball screws, and others of general interest. TC43 produced ANSI B5.48, which was approved as an American National Standard and published in 1977.  Charter  Machining Center The charter of the ASME B5 Machine Tool Standards committee is \\"The standardization of machine tools, cutting tools and of the elements of machine tool construction and operation relating primarily to their use in manufacturing operations, including: * Work and tool holding elements * Driving mechanisms that constitute an inherent part of the machine tool * Components and associated appurtenances * Nomenclature, designations, sizes, and capacities * Tests for accuracy of machine tools and of work and tool holding parts or elements * Movements and adjustments of machine tool elements * Parts and elements for adjusting, guiding, and aligning work or tools, including slots and tapes, but excluding, punches, dies and screw taps.\\"  Technical subcommittees  Technical subcommittees under ASME B5 address the formulation and maintenance of standards in particular disciplines within the scope of the B5 charter. Membership includes a carefully balanced representation in various interest classifications so that no one group dominates. Some examples of the various interest classifications are: users, manufacturers, consultants, insurance interests, universities, testing laboratories, and government regulatory agencies. There are over 40 Standards that are periodically reviewed to ensure they reflect new developments and technical advances (e.g., new materials, new designs and new applications). Several new standards are under development or being considered in the areas of Tool Holder Interfaces, Machine Performance Evaluation, Micromachining, Energy Assessment, and Robotics. The current list (2015) of B5 subcommittees includes: TC 11 - Chucks and Chuck Jaws TC 30 - Power Press Standards Typical Ball Screw TC 43 - Ball Screws TC 45 - Spindle Noses and Tool Shanks for Machining Centers TC 52 - Machine Tool Performance TC 54 - Tool Connection Gages for Machine Tools TC 55 - Tool Identification Systems (RFID) TC 56 - Information Technology for Machine Tools TC 65 - Micromachining TC 94 - Cutting Tools = ASME B5 also provides the ANSI-sanctioned Technical Advisory Groups to ISO regarding machine tool technology.

Long- chain acyl-CoA esters are substrates for a number of important enzymatic reactions and play a central role in the regulation of metabolism as allosteric regulators of several enzymes. To participate in specific metabolic processes, fatty acids must first be activated by being joined in thioester linkage (R-CO-SCoA) to the -SH group of coenzyme A, where R is a fatty carbon chain. The thioester bond is a high energy bond. The activation reaction normally occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum or the outer mitochondrial membrane. This is an ATP-requiring reaction (fatty acyl-CoA synthase), yielding AMP and pyrophosphate (PPi). Different enzymes are specific for fatty acids of different chain length. Then, the acyl CoA esters are transported in mitochondria. They are converted to fatty acyl carnitine by carnitine acyltransferase I, an enzyme of the inner leaflet of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Fatty acyl carnitine is then transported by an antiport in exchange for free carnitine to the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. There carnitine acyltransferase II reverses the process, producing fatty acyl- CoA and carnitine. This shuttle mechanism is required only for longer chain fatty acids. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acyl-CoA derivatives are degraded by a series of reactions that release acetyl-CoA and leads to the production of NADH and FADH2. There are four steps in fatty acid oxidation pathway; oxidation, hydration, oxidation, and thiolysis. It requires 7 rounds of this pathway to degrade palmitate (a C16 fatty acid).

Phenylacetic, 3-phenylpropanoic and 3-phenylpropenoic (cinnamic) acids are found in propolis, mammalian exocrine secretions or plant fragrances. During a systematic study of the lipids from seeds of the plant Araceae, the presence of 13-phenyltridecanoic acid as a major component (5-16% of total fatty acids)was discovered. Other similar compounds but with 11 and 15 carbon chain lengths and saturated or unsaturated were shown to be also present but in lower amounts. At the same time, the even carbon chain ω-phenylalkanoic acids of C10 up to C16 were discovered in halophilic bacteria. ω-phenylalkanoic acid (x = 1 to 17) Later, an exhaustive study of 17 genus of the subfamily Aroideae of Araceae revealed the presence of three major acids, 11-phenylundecanoic acid, 13-phenyltridecanoic acid and 15-phenylpentadecanoic acid in seed lipids. Other odd carbon number acids from C7 to C23 were detected but in trace amounts. Similarly, two series of homologous odd carbon number monounsaturated ω-phenylalkanoic acids were found. Thus, it can be stated that all odd carbon chain ω-phenylalkanoic acids from C1 through C23 have been found in nature. Furthermore, even carbon chain ω-phenylalkanoic acids from C10 through C16 were also detected. Substituted phenylalkenoic acids are periodically encountered in nature. As an example, rubrenoic acids were purified from Alteromonas rubra, compounds which showed bronchodilatatoric properties. Methyl phenylalkenoic acids (5 carbon chain) have been described from a terrestrial Streptomycete. Serpentene, a similar polyunsaturated phenylalkenoic acid, is also produced by Streptomyces and was shown to have some antibacterial properties. Several serpentene-like compounds have also been isolated from the same bacterial source. Several bicyclic derivatives of linolenic acid were shown to be generated by alkali isomerization. The stink from the stinkpot turtle (Sternotherus odoratus) contains at least four different foul smelling ω-phenylalkanoic acids, including phenylacetic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, 5-phenylpentanoic acid, and 7-phenylheptanoic acid. Bicyclic hexahydroindenoic acid Some others (alkyl-phenyl)-alkanoic acids) are formed when linolenic acid is warmed at 260–270 °C. Several forms with 16, 18 and 20 carbon atoms were identified in archaeological pottery vessels and were presumed to have been generated during heating triunsaturated fatty acids. They were used as biomarkers to trace the ancient processing of marine animal in these vessels. Several benzoic acid derivatives have been described in leaves of various Piperaceae species. Thus, a prenylated benzoic acid acid derivative, crassinervic acid, has been isolated from Piper crassinervium. Crassinervic acid Similar compounds were isolated from Piper aduncum (aduncumene) and P. gaudichaudianum (gaudichaudianic acid). All these molecules showed high potential as antifungal compounds. A prenylated benzoic acid with a side chain formed of two isoprene units has also been isolated from the leaves of Piper aduncum. More recently, three prenylated benzoic acid derivatives with four isoprene units have been extracted from the leaves of P. heterophyllum and P. aduncum. These compounds displayed moderate antiplasmodial (against Plasmodium falciparum) and trypanocidal (against Trypanosoma cruzi) activities.
