Karen Schoemer‚Äôs review of their debut album for The New York Times put their sound in historical context: ‚ÄúThis young band from Atlanta is so at home with the musical languages of past eras, one can imagine it sharing cocktail chitchat with Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra and the Gershwins.‚Äù Billboard‚Äôs Chris Morris described them as a ‚Äúsweet, swinging.‚Äù The Jody Grind opened for R.E.M., Bob Margolin, Robyn Hitchcock and Poi Dog Pondering.  History  In 1988, vocalist Kelly Hogan met Bill Taft at one of his open mic nights at the White Dot in Atlanta. A mutual appreciation of old-time jazz and swing kicked off the friendship, and Taft soon invited Hogan to perform with him. They were soon joined by David Ellis (bass) and Walter Brewer (drums) and performed as An Evening With the Garbagemen. Ellis left soon after, and the band continued as a three-piece. He was eventually replaced by Robert Hayes. By 1989, they were known as The Jody Grind. In 1990, the band released their debut album, One Man's Trash (Is Another Man's Treasure). It was produced by John Keane and released by DB Records. Said Schoemer of that debut album: ‚ÄúTheir eclecticism never sounds forced; the performances are loose and enthusiastic, and each song is linked by the smoky, sashaying vocals of Kelly Hogan Murray. Her singing, like the album, feels effortless and lovely.‚Äù By 1990 they were playing packed crowds in Atlanta, many times sharing the bill with Atlanta performance artist and poet Deacon Lunchbox. In 1992, The Jody Grind released their second album, Lefty's Deceiver. It was also produced by John Keane and released by DB Records. Soon after the album was recorded, Rob Clayton joined the band as their new drummer. On April 19, 1992, less than a week after the release of Lefty‚Äôs Deceiver, a camper driven by a drunk driver crossed the I-65 median near Greenville, Alabama, and struck a borrowed van carrying Clayton, Hayes and Deacon Lunchbox, who were heading back to Atlanta from shows in Florida. Clayton, Hayes and Deacon Lunchbox died at the scene. Hogan and Taft had decided to spend the night in Pensacola and did not learn of the crash until arriving home. After the crash, Hogan and Taft disbanded The Jody Grind and formed a duo called Kick Me. Allen Page joined Kick Me, but the band broke up following his heroin overdose in 1994. Hogan later moved to Chicago to continue a solo career, and has since played with a variety of bands, including Rock*A*Teens, Wee Hairy Beasties and Neko Case. Taft still lives in Atlanta and has been involved with several project since, including Another Evening with the Garbageman, Smoke, Hubcap City and W8ing4UFOs.

It lies in Knivsta Municipality, a suburb to Stockholm. The church is associated with the Archdiocese of Uppsala of the Church of Sweden. History and architecture Alsike Church, interior Alsike Church stands by a formerly important sea-route linking Uppsala, Sigtuna and Stockholm, in an area characterised by its old cultural landscape. Although the oldest parts of the presently visible church date from the 13th century, it was probably pre-dated by an earlier wooden church. The church is constructed largely in brick, a material not usually used in medieval churches in Uppland (fieldstone was often the material of choice). The use of brick may be explained by the vicinity to the more costly churches in Sigtuna or Sko Abbey near Skokloster Castle (Skoklosters slott). The main part of the church was probably built circa 1250-1350. The tower and the church porch date from the 15th century, and during the same century the church was also equipped with mural-decorated vaults; due to later damage these have been rebuilt and only fragments of the murals still remain. The church was rebuilt during the mid-19th century. Two transepts were added, and the exterior whitewashed. Inside the church was equipped with a new pulpit and new pews. In 1910-11, the church was redecorated internally with paintings in Art Nouveau style by architect Sigurd Curman (1879-1966). During repairs in 1947 a runestone was discovered in the church; it is displayed at the church entrance. The church is characterised by a mix of medieval and neoclassical styles as a result of the reconstruction during the 19th century. Among the furnishings, a Venetian crucifix from 1600 and a figure of Christ from the 15th century are noteworthy.

Campaigns and battles In December 1669, Colbert - who assumed command of naval (la marine) services after having nominated in November Louis de Bourbon, the legitimate heir of Louis XIV, aged only ten years, to the Admiralty of France - enacted an ordinance which created two regiments destined for naval service on the vessels and in the colonies. The regiments were designated ¬´ Royal-La Marine ¬ª and ¬´ Amiral ¬ª. The regiment Royal-La Marine was attached to the Flotte du Ponant. The Royal Navy () in need of quality marine offices, nominated the possibility of having naval officers of the two regiment as marine officers. In the same spirit on December 26, 1669, was constituted, a ¬´ Garde de Monsieur l'Amiral ¬ª ( Guard of Monsieur Admiral ), even referred as ¬´ Garde de Monsieur le comte de Vermandois ¬ª ( Guard of Monsieur the Count of Vermandois ), which was created to become a crucible of marine officers. With Louvois intervention, a new regulation of July 1670 passed the nomination of the officers of these two regiments - attached to the navy since creation - to the authority of the minist√®re de la Guerre, while also amending the possibility to pass naval officers to form the officers marine corps. Such a new regulation was the first passage of the \\"bigor\\" of the navy () to the French Army. The only service at sea of these two regiments was brief. In August 1670, they embarked on the fleet of Duquesne on their way to the Canary Islands and Green Cape, and were back in Brest on March 11, 1671. On August 13, 1704, while through the decisive Battle of Blenheim (), during the War of the Spanish Succession (), Le Royal-La Marine was part of the reserve army of mar√©chal Marsin, foreseen to support the Franco-Bavarian, placed under the command of Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard and Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. In 1720-1721, the regiment garrisoned at Souppes sur Loing (Seine et Marne) and participated to the construction of the canal du Loing. On June 27, 1743, the regiment participated to the Battle of Dettingen (). The following year, the regiment participated to the Siege of Menin, the Siege of Ypres (1744) () then Furnes, prior to joining the army of mar√©chal de Saxe at Courtrai. From 1779 to 1782, the r√©giment Royal-La Marine participated to operations in Antilles The 1st battalion of the 60th Line Infantry Regiment conducted the campaign of 1794 at the arm√©e de l'Ouest (); the 2e, embarked at La Rochelle in 1792 for Saint-Domingue, where garrison would be held until 1794. Personalities having served in the R√©giment Royal‚ÄìLa Marine *Joseph Claude Vincent de Kermoysan, Breton knight, was Captain of the Regiment between 1740 and 1750. *In 1780, Amateur-J√©r√¥me Le Bras des Forges de Boishardy (), son of a musketeer, entered the Regiment, where he stayed twelve years. *In the same year, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte (), future Marshal of France and then King of Sweden and Norway, began his military career by entering the regiment as a soldier at the age of 17. In 1789, he became sergeant.

He was a grandson of Gerald Dillon, whose elder brother Sir Robert Dillon founded the senior branch of the family which held the title Earl of Roscommon. Thomas's father, Richard Dillon, was a High Court judge. He entered the Inner Temple in 1559. Having been called to the Bar he briefly held office as justice of Wexford, then practiced on the Connacht circuit. He became Chief Justice of Connacht in 1577 in which office he gained a reputation for integrity, and was suggested as a possible Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1582. In 1593, despite the general understanding that a provincial Chief Justiceship should not be combined with a seat on the High Court Bench, he became a justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). He continued to spend most of his time in Connacht, but in 1596 he clashed with his formidable superior, Sir Richard Bingham, the Lord President of Connaught, and was committed to Dublin Castle as a result. He was restored to favour the following year, after Bingham himself suffered temporary disgrace and fled to England.

Plot A music master leads his band to a field where five telegraph lines are strung on utility poles. Hoisting up a giant treble clef, he turns the set of lines into a giant musical staff. He then uses copies of his own head to spell out the tune for \\"God Save the King,\\" and his band joins in. Production and release M√©li√®s himself plays the lead role of the music master. The superimposition effects in The M√©lomaniac, allowing multiple M√©li√®s heads to appear on the staff, were created by a multiple exposure technique requiring the same strip of film to be run through the camera seven times. The rest of the film's special effects were created with substitution splices. The film was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 479‚Äì480 in its catalogues. The film was registered for American copyright at the Library of Congress on 30 June 1903. The French film scholars Jacques Malth√™te and Laurent Mannoni believe The M√©lomaniac to be M√©li√®s's most famous trick film, and a M√©li√®s guide from the Centre national de la cin√©matographie judges that the film merits that position.

Coming with his family to Lockport, Illinois, Arnold worked in his father's store until the outbreak of the Civil War. Arnold served with the 4th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry and the Chicago Mercantile Independent Battery Light Artillery, eventually being captured and imprisoned at Camp Ford, Texas. After the war he ran his father's store and was elected to two terms in the Illinois Senate. He was later named a United States Marshal. Biography John William Arnold was born in White Creek, New York on February 14, 1842, the fourth of seven children to John H. and Lucretia Arnold. Arnold came with his family to Lockport, Illinois when he was fourteen. He graduated from Lockport High School in 1860 and briefly worked as a clerk in his father's store. When the Civil War began the next year, Arnold enlisted in the 4th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry of the Union Army. He fought with the unit at Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Corinth, Shiloh, and Hatcher's Run. He then fell ill with typhoid fever and was discharged on August 1, 1862. He returned after recovery with the Chicago Mercantile Independent Battery Light Artillery, where he fought at Arkansas Post, Port Gibson, Champion Hill, Big Black River Bridge, Vicksburg, and Mansfield. At Mansfield, the brigade was captured and Arnold made prisoner. He was confined at Camp Ford in Texas for fourteen months. After his release was negotiated at the end of the war, Arnold returned to his father's store in Lockport. He was elected postmaster of Lockport in 1888, serving for a year. In 1890, he was elected to the Illinois Senate as a Democrat. He served two two-year terms. In 1894, President Grover Cleveland appointed Arnold Marshal of the Northern District of Illinois. He served for four years and then returned to the store in Lockport and engaged in some real estate and loan dealings in Chicago. Arnold married Abbie Matthewson on December 22, 1869. They had three children, although only John W., Jr. survived it to adulthood. He was the commander of the F. L. Gooding Post #401 Grand Army of the Republic.

It has gone viral, and by 5 February 2014, had over 12 million views on YouTube. Its goal is to discourage truancy in schools. The ad was produced by Henry and Aaron, a filmmaking and comedy duo from Perth, Australia, with a history of making viral videos intended to shock, and the ad states that they did so on behalf of the \\"Learn for Life Foundation of Western Australia\\". As of June 2016 the video is currently sitting at over 20 million views of YouTube  Campaign plot  In the video, four teenagers skip school, get into a Volkswagen van and drive to the beach, where they enjoy surfing, drinking beer, and generally relaxing and enjoying themselves. However, the ad takes an abrupt turn for the worse when one of the girls steps on a land mine and is immediately blown to bits, and two of the others are dispatched in a similar way. One surviving girl is then shown screaming before zooming out to show that the beach they had driven to that day was, in fact, an explosives testing site, before the screaming stops and a mushroom cloud appears. The film ends with the slogan, \\"This is what happens when you slack off. Stay in school.\\" Reactions A reporter for the International Business Times said that the ad \\"might be the most gruesome [PSA] yet,\\" a remark that was echoed by Lee Moran writing for the New York Daily News and by The Daily Mirror's Rebecca Pocklington. Lance Richardson wrote that \\"As deterrents for skipping class go, severed body parts and a lingering mushroom cloud are pretty extreme.\\" He went on to question whether the ad was authentic, and noted that the website of the organization on behalf of which it was supposedly produced (i.e. The Learn for Life Foundation of Western Australia) \\"features stock images of smiling people, and no contacts, explanations, or further details beyond the single video and a link to its directorial team, Henry and Aaron.\\" He concluded that it was \\"probably a good bet to assume that Inglis and McCann invented the Foundation for the sake of the joke.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Public service announcements Category:Viral videos Category:2014 films Category:Australian short films Category:Australian advertising slogans Category:Words and phrases introduced in 2014 Category:Australian films Category:Online advertising ","title":"Set Yourself Free"},{"id":"41865702","text":"Bazmak or Bezmak (), also rendered as Bizmak, may refer to: * Bazmak-e Olya * Bazmak-e Sofla ","title":"Bazmak"},{"id":"41865707","text":"Plan of the building Exterior view Modiano Market or Stoa Modiano (Greek: Œ£œÑŒøŒ¨ ŒúŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒø) is an enclosed market in Thessaloniki, Greece.

Its aim is to provide risk- adjusted data for the purpose of reducing variability in adult trauma outcomes and offering best practice guidelines to improve trauma care. TQIP makes use of national data to allows hospitals to objectively evaluate their trauma centers' performance relative to other hospitals. TQIP's administrative costs are less than those of other programs, making it an accessible tool for assessing performance and enhancing quality of trauma care. Background Morbidity and mortality rates are variable across United States trauma centers. Institutional variations can be attributed to differences in both patient population and quality of care at each institution. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) report To Err is Human: Building A Safer Health System emphasized the importance of recognizing variability and inefficiencies in the United States healthcare system. To address these discrepancies, John Fildes, MD, FACS created an ad hoc work group to create and implement an outcomes- based, validated, risk-adjusted trauma quality improvement system. The goal was to utilize existing trauma infrastructures to measure and continually improve the quality of trauma care. This was done by accessing each hospital's registry database using the National Trauma Data Standard (NTDS) from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), resulting in the creation of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) by the American College of Surgeons (ACS). TQIP was preceded by surgical indicators that included the Optimal Resources for the Care of the Injured reference document, published by the ACS Committee on Trauma in 1979. The document created a framework for the trauma center verification review process with a systems approach to trauma care. The Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS) of 19821989 subsequently established the national standards for trauma care. The MTOS database also facilitated the creation of a methodology to estimate an individual trauma patient's survival probability, also known as the Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS). Other studies, such as the 2006 National Study of the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma (NSCOT), aimed to identify differences in expenditures and outcomes at various hospitals. Pilot study=Design A pilot study was initiated in June 2008 to refine the methodology and assess the feasibility of applying TQIP for quality improvement at different trauma centers. Twenty-three Level I and II trauma centers volunteered and were selected to participate in the study with ACS verification. Most Level I centers are university-based trauma centers with comprehensive services. Level II centers were included to increase geographic and patient diversity, as well as the statistical power of any analyses. Each participating center received a registrar training course that included information about TQIP objectives and infrastructures, critical data collection fields, and NTDS data definitions. Webinars with conference calls and test case data abstraction were used for follow-up training. Using NTDB data from patients admitted to trauma centers between January 1 and December 1, 2007, three cohorts were created. The first cohort included patients with blunt multisystem or blunt mechanism traumas with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ‚â• 3 in two or more regions including the head, face, neck, thorax, abdomen, spine, and extremities. The second cohort was composed of trauma patients with penetrating truncal injuries with an AIS score ‚â• 3 in at least one region including the neck, thorax, and abdomen. Patients in the third cohort had a blunt single-system injury with an AIS score ‚â• 3 in only one AIS body region, with the remaining regions having a maximum AIS score of 2. The outcomes of interest were death during hospitalization as evidenced by an emergency department (ED) discharge disposition of ‚Äúdeath‚Äù or hospital discharge disposition of ‚Äúexpired,‚Äù as well as the prevalence of inpatient complications. Results Data reports were created and distributed to each participating trauma center in June 2009. Results were consistent with the previous year's baseline findings. Cohorts of similar verified trauma centers had differences in risk-adjusted mortality rates with a large amount of variance between low-outlier and high-outlier trauma centers. The aggregate group had a relative risk-mortality of 3.3, while the single-system trauma cohort had a mortality 5.9 times higher for high-outlier facilities. The TQIP pilot results gave each trauma center feedback regarding their trauma outcomes relative to other hospitals. The results also shed light on appropriate actions to undertake in order to improve quality, such as by illuminating local or regional collaborative efforts that could implemented. Overall, the pilot study demonstrated that TQIP's anonymous measures of relative performance could successfully allow trauma centers to identify shortcomings and facilitate quality improvement using existing resources and systems at local, regional, and national levels. Methodology TQIP utilizes a retrospective cohort of trauma patients in designated and ACS-verified Level I and II hospitals in the United States and Canada. There is no minimum sample size requirement for a trauma center to participate in the program. , over 200 participating Level I and II trauma centers that vary in type (public, private teaching university, teaching community, etc.) and region participate in TQIP. Inclusion criteria To participate in the program, patients must meet the following inclusion criteria: be an adult greater than sixteen years of age with at least one valid ICD 9 CM diagnosis code, history of blunt or penetrating mechanisms of injury, or have an AIS score ‚â• 3. Eligible patients also must have emergency department or hospital dispositions available. Exclusion criteria Patients are excluded from the program if they have a pre-existing advance directive to withhold life-sustaining measures or are older than 65 years of age and have an isolated hip fracture. Patient categorization The program categorizes patients into different cohorts in order to evaluate different aspects of trauma care. The cohorts are as follows: # Blunt multisystem injury with an AIS > 3 in a least two regions of the body # Penetrating truncal injury with an AIS > 3 in the regions of the neck, chest, or abdomen # Shock patients with a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg # Patients with isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) # Elderly patients (over 65 years of age) without isolated hip fractures Outcomes This program focuses on mortality, complications, and resource use. Mortality is further subdivided into on arrival, in the emergency department, and in- hospital. Complications are further subdivided into urinary tract infections, deep venous thrombosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-related bacteremia, renal failure, and surgical site infections. Resource use is measured via length of stay in the hospital, length of stay in the intensive care unit, and number of days that a patient is on a ventilator. Data quality TQIP addresses quality issues by explicitly addressing certain care metrics, including monitoring intracranial pressure in patients with traumatic brain injuries, measuring time to operations, measuring the placement and timing of tracheostomies, measuring the time to hemorrhage control, and documenting the use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. TQIP helps ensure the quality of data by providing training for trauma registrars and data abstractors. TQIP administrators hold monthly activities, such as webinars and quizzes, to educate registrars on the importance of data quality. Administrators assess outlier values, perform internal and external validation, and perform data logic checks. Statistical analyses TQIP measures multiple variables in its risk-adjustment models. These variables include factors such as age, race, gender, initial pulse rate in the emergency department, the mechanism of injury, etc. An 18 variable multivariable logistic regression model is used to estimate risk-adjusted mortality for trauma patients. Results provide observed-to-expected ratios and a 90% confidence interval of a trauma center's data compared to other de-identified trauma centers in order to gauge relative variability. Applications TQIP is designed to give each hospital an objective measure of its trauma center's performance compared to that of other trauma centers. It is meant as a self- reflective tool to be used in determining how to improve outcomes and decrease costs by understanding the reasons for variability and identifying best practices. Results are not intended to be used for marketing purposes or bestowing competitive advantages. TQIP reports allow hospitals to focus on outcomes and workflows, including care coordination, in-hospital processes, and resource allocation. Deliverables TQIP's external benchmarking utilizes NTDB data collection and NTDS with specific enhancements. Deliverables comprise risk adjusted hospital comparisons in the form of one annual benchmark report as well as two separate annual reports related to a topic of interest and the TQIP online analysis tool. Education and training are delivered via the annual meeting, online training, monthly educational experiences for abstractors, and monthly open forum calls for registry staff. Data are submitted quarterly and quality is monitored through a data validation site visit, a TQIP validator, and data quality reporting. Feedback to participating trauma centers about their relative performance encourages the sharing of practices during the annual meeting with emphasis on high performers and web conferences. The TQIP annual fee is $9,000 and includes the deliverables above. Additional costs include the salary of the registrar and trauma registry software. As the compilation and maintenance of the trauma registry are required for verification, the additional cost to a currently verified trauma center is for participation. Debate=Data TQIP's outcome estimates are heavily dependent on data quality and sample size for each participating trauma center. Despite the development of sophisticated statistical models which attempt to mitigate errors in precision, the small sample sizes of highly specific trauma patient populations will inevitably skew results. Similarly, centers reporting data need to be hyper-aware of their reporting for data fields for certain patient populations susceptible to biased or missing data (e.g., high prevalence of low Injury Severity Scores for patients with early death who did not receive complete diagnostic testing or autopsies). Racial/ethnic minority trauma outcomes , TQIP has not incorporated measures related to racial disparities in trauma outcomes. However, there is evidence to suggest that differences in trauma outcomes are due to the overall quality of hospitals serving higher proportions of minority patients, rather than being due to discriminatory delivery of care; that is, these hospitals are less likely to provide recommended care to patients. In fact, almost 80% of trauma centers serving primarily minority patients are classified as high mortality trauma centers due to their ratios of observed- to-expected survival rates. Patients from all racial and ethnic backgrounds appear to be 40% more likely to survive when treated at low mortality trauma centers when compared with patients of the same race and ethnicity with the same injuries being treated at high mortality trauma centers. Differences between groups are relatively small compared to overall discrepancies between recommended and observed care. Still, high mortality status is not universal among institutions treating predominantly minority patients, and TQIP has not addressed this inequity. Exclusions TQIP excludes from statistical analyses all dead on arrival (DOA) patients and those who expire in the emergency department. This is done out of concern regarding varying patient transit times among trauma centers located in more urban vs. rural environments as well as the severity of injuries more likely to be present at certain trauma centers. However, this practice has the potential to remove a sizable number of patients from a trauma center's mortality index (for example, if a trauma center that is exceptionally skillful at the resuscitation phase of care may receive no credit), thus impeding analysis of a vital component of trauma care. Similarly, there can be great variation in how trauma centers classify DOA patients, leading to differences in treatment (e.g., resuscitation attempts or other invasive procedures). While independent researchers have found that inclusion of ED deaths in statistical analyses yields only small, insignificant changes in TQIP outcomes, doing so eliminates bias that might otherwise be introduced. Current status , over 200 Level I or Level II trauma centers are participating in TQIP, which is facilitating the identification of high performers. Enrollment is done on a rolling basis that allows hospitals to join at any time. Additionally, a pediatric TQIP pilot with thirty-eight participating centers is currently underway and external data validation has been implemented.http://www.facs.org/trauma/ntdb/tqip.html ReferencesExternal links * TQIP website * American College of Surgeons * Michigan TQIP Category:Traumatology ","title":"Trauma Quality Improvement Program"},{"id":"41865750","text":"Mirzamohammadi () may refer to: * Mirzamohammadi-ye Bala * Mirzamohammadi-ye Pain ","title":"Mirzamohammadi"},{"id":"41865777","text":"The Best of The Dubliners is a UK 1967 compilation album by The Dubliners.

He previously played for the Greater Western Sydney Giants from 2013 to 2016. In August of 2020, McCarthy was notified by the Fremantle Football Club that he would not be receiving a contract for the 2021 Afl Season; McCarthy and Fremantle mutually parted ways. Early career McCarthy came from a cricket background and focused on becoming a footballer after being the last player chosen in the Western Australia under 18 team in 2013, this was due to his talents in both cricket and football. He chose the AFL pathway after some inspiration from a South Fremantle colts coach. He came to prominence with an impressive AFL Under 18 Championships with the highlight being when he kicked the after-the-siren winning goal for Western Australia against Vic Country in round four of the Championships, before suffering a broken leg in the final round against South Australia. AFL career He was drafted by the Greater Western Sydney Giants with pick 14 in the 2013 AFL draft. He made his debut in round 23, 2014 against the Western Bulldogs at Etihad Stadium, McCarthy started the game as the substitute, but kicked a long goal from the boundary line with his first kick in AFL football. On 10 September 2015, news broke that McCarthy was requesting a trade to his home state of Western Australia, the next day, Greater Western Sydney \\"categorically rejected\\" his trade request due to him being contracted until the end of the 2017 season. Despite persistent efforts by during the trade period, he remained at Greater Western Sydney. After the failed bid to move to Fremantle during the home period, McCarthy decided to return to Western Australia due to homesickness and did not play for the entirety of the 2016 AFL season. He was officially traded to Fremantle during the 2016 trade period. In 2017, McCarthy kicked 25 goals from 19 games. He finished first in Fremantle's leading goal kicking. He was suspended for two weeks in round 15 for careless contact with St Kilda's Sam Gilbert. He was also surprisingly omitted from the round 23 team who took on Essendon. His most noted performance came in Round 4 where he kicked a late goal, with a toe-poke deep in the goal square, with 2 minutes remaining to lead Fremantle to a 2-point victory over Melbourne, in Melbourne. Another impressive performance was a 4-goal haul, with 18 disposals, against Gold Coast in round 20 at Domain Stadium. In 2019, ahead of the Round 1 clash with North Melbourne, McCarthy was called up to the senior team seemingly as a replacement for new recruit Jesse Hogan, despite not playing in either pre- season match. He was arguably Fremantle's best player in the demolition of North Melbourne in a career-best performance, kicking five goals and collecting 20 disposals.

The style includes a wide variety of mostly American and British recordings of R&B; and pop music made between the late 1950s and mid 1960s, often relatively obscure, and characterised by a slow or medium, rather than fast, tempo. The style has been described by musician and writer Bob Stanley as \\"possibly the last truly underground music scene in Europe\\". Origins The Popcorn music scene first developed from dances held at the Groove discotheque in Ostend, where mid- tempo soul and ska music played by DJ Freddy Cousaert became popular in the late 1960s.Michel Scarpone, \\"History of Belgium Popcorn\\", first published in Discoveries magazine . Retrieved 6 February 2014 \\"Brief overview of the birth of 'Popcorn' oldies.\\", PopcornOldies.be. Retrieved 6 February 2014 Cousaert was later responsible for Marvin Gaye's move to Belgium in the early 1980s. Bob Stanley, \\"Belgium's 'Popcorn': the last underground music scene in Europe\\", The Guardian, 5 February 2014. Retrieved 6 February 2014 In September 1969, a caf√©, De Oude Hoeve, opened in a converted farm barn at Vrasene near Antwerp, and began holding dance competitions on Sunday afternoons. Soon up to 3,000 people began attending each week, dancing in a \\"slow swing\\" style to soul and funk records. The caf√© was renamed the Popcorn ‚Äì after the James Brown hit \\"The Popcorn\\"‚Äîand DJ Gilbert Govaert began playing more early soul and other records from the 1960s to suit the dance style. According to Stanley: \\"The beat was slow and slightly rickety, martial drums rolled under melancholy minor chords‚Äîthe Marvelettes' 'Please Mr Postman' (1961) would have been typical.\\"Bob Stanley, \\"A voyage of discovery to Belgium's Popcorn clubs\\", Frieze, no. 147, May 2012 . Retrieved 6 February 2014 Following the Popcorn club's popularity, other clubs sprang up playing music in a similar style. These included the Festival in Antwerp, the Gatsby in Vliermaal, and the Versailles, beside the beach at Ostend. As well as Cousaert and Govaert, other leading DJs included Jeff Callebaut, Gerry Franken and Georges Toniotti. Radio stations were set up to play the music, and rare music on obscure labels became especially prized. The scene in Belgium in many ways paralleled the Northern soul scene in Britain, but with a slower swing style of music favoured, rather than the fast dance styles characteristic of Northern soul. In some cases, DJs slowed down records, by pitch control and by playing 45 rpm discs at 33 rpm, to achieve the desired tempo and rhythm. The range of the music also broadened, to include some British and Italian pop music from the early 1960s, and eventually local bands were formed to emulate the style. Examples According to Bob Stanley, \\"the purity of Belgian Popcorn is its very impurity. R&B;, Broadway numbers, tangos, Phil Spector-esque girl groups and loungey instrumentals, they are all constituent parts of a rare, and still largely undiscovered scene\\". Examples of highly prized popcorn records include \\"Sweetheart\\" by Peggy Lee, \\"Image\\" by Hank Levine, \\"Now I Lay Me Down to Weep\\" by Simone Dina, \\"The Tingle\\" by Jackie Weaver, \\"Who's Got the Action\\" by Phil Colbert, \\"Heartless Lover\\" by Dick Baker, \\"La Tanya\\" by Jay Abbott, \\"Carmelita\\" by Jeff Lane, \\"I'm Crying in the Rain\\" by Major Lance, \\"You Beat Me to the Punch\\" by Mary Wells, \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" by Mel Torm√©, and \\"Twine Time\\" by Alvin Cash. Continuing popularity After a period of mainstream popularity in Belgium, and to a lesser extent in France and the Netherlands, the Popcorn dance scene retreated to smaller venues and specialist clubs, while retaining a core of aficionados. By the 1990s, the style was beginning to be known and appreciated at soul music clubs in Britain, Germany, and the US, and its level of recognition has continued to increase. At least 30 compilations of American and other R&B; and pop music in the Belgian Popcorn style have been issued in Europe.

She was one of the leading European two- year-old fillies of her generation, winning three of her eight races including two of Ireland's most important races for juveniles: the Phoenix Stakes and the Moyglare Stud Stakes. She raced three times as a three-year-old in 2008, producing her best effort when a close third in the 1000 Guineas. She was sold for over ¬£2 million at the end of her racing career and became a broodmare in the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed. Background Saoirse Abu (an Irish phrase which can be translated as Freedom Forever) is a chestnut mare with a white star bred in Kentucky by White Cloud Bloodstock, Omar Trevino and N & P Partnership. Her sire, Mr Greeley was an American sprinter who won at Grade III level and finished second in the 1995 Breeders' Cup Sprint. Although he was based in the United States throughout his stud career, he had great success in Europe, siring Finsceal Beo and the Sussex Stakes winner Reel Buddy. Saoirse Abu's dam, Out Too Late was an unraced daughter of Morning Has Broken, a mare whose other descendants included Balanchine and the Prix de Diane winner West Wind. In September 2006, the filly was consigned to the Keeneland yearling sales where she was bought for $260,000 by BBA Ireland. She entered into the ownership of the County Meath-based Ennistown Stud and was sent to Ireland where she was trained by Jim Bolger at Coolcullen, County Carlow. Saoirse Abu was ridden in all but one of her races by Kevin Manning. Racing career=2007: two-year-old season Saoirse Abu began her racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Naas Racecourse on 16 May when she finished third of the twenty runners, beaten two lengths and a head by Raja and Pretty Ballerina. Eleven days later, in a similar event at the Curragh, the filly recorded her first success as she took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and won \\"easily\\" by four lengths from the colt Norman Invader. Saoirse Abu was moved up in class for her next race, the Group Three Swordlestown Stud Sprint Stakes at Naas on 4 June in which she finished second by a length to the Aidan O'Brien-trained You'resothrilling, a filly who went on to win the Cherry Hinton Stakes in England. In the Listed Saoire Stakes at the Curragh at the end of the month, the filly started 9/10 favourite but after racing in second place for the first half of the race, made no further impression and finished of the seven runners behind Listen. In July, she was moved up in distance for the Listed Silver Flash Stakes over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse. Ridden by D J Dolan (Manning opted to ride a more fancied stable companion), she finished third of the nine fillies behind Triskel and Mad About You. On 12 August Saoirse Abu was again moved up in class for the Group One Phoenix Stakes in which she was matched against colts over six furlongs on heavy ground. Equipped with blinkers for the first time, she was made the 25/1 outsider of the six runner field with Aidan O'Brien's unbeaten Coventry Stakes winner Henrythenavigator starting odds on favourite ahead of the Queen Mary Stakes winner Elletelle. Manning positioned the filly just behind the leaders before taking the lead in the final quarter mile. She was overtaken by Henrythenavigator a furlong from the finish, but rallied strongly to regain the lead in the closing stages and defeat the colt by a length with Elletelle one and three quarter lengths back in third place. Three weeks later, over seven furlongs at the Curragh, Saoirse Abu contested the Moyglare Stud Stakes, Ireland's only Group One race restricted to two-year-old fillies. Despite her previous Group One success, she was only third in the betting behind Listen and the English-trained Albabilia, the winner of the Sweet Solera Stakes. Saoirse Abu raced in third place before moving up to challenge Albabilia in the final quarter mile. She took the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and a half lengths from Listen, Mad About You and Albabilia. After the race, Jim Bolger said \\"I have been very happy with her. She is a hardy horse and is very professional. We have no definite plans as yet but I wouldn't be certain she would be seen out again on the track this season. The 1,000 Guineas is the real aim for her next year, and even at this stage, she wants a mile really\\". On 29 September, the filly was sent to England and moved up in distance for the Group One Meon Valley Stud Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse in which she was again matched against Listen. Saoirse Abu raced in second place before briefly taking the lead two furlongs out, but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and finished third behind Listen and the French-trained favourite Proviso. 2008: three- year-old season Saoirse Abu began her second season in the Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes over seven furlongs on 7 April. She started at odds of 2/1 and kept on well in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win and finished third behind and Halfway to Heaven. Four weeks later, Saoirse Abu started a 20/1 outsider in a field of fifteen for the classic 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Manning restrained the filly behind the leaders and briefly struggled to obtain a clear run approaching the final furlong. She stayed on well in the closing stages to finish third behind Natagora and Spacious, a length behind the winner. On 25 May, the filly started the 7/2 second favourite for the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh. She was held up by Manning at the back of the thirteen runner field but after moving into contention two furlongs from the finish, was unable to make further progress and finished fifth, behind Halfway to Heaven, Tuscan Evening, Mad About You and Caribbean Sunset. Saoirse Abu did not race again. On 1 December, she was offered for sale at the Tattersalls Breeding Stock Sale at Newmarket and bought for 1,950,000 guineas by John Ferguson, acting on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed. A representative of the Ennistown Stud commented \\"Maybe in 10 years' time I'll have a couple of Saoirse Abus out in the field but for me she was too valuable to hold on to\\". Breeding career Saoirse Abu was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Sheikh Mohammed's Dalham Hall stud. To date, she has produced two foals: *Ennistown (bay gelding, foaled in 2010, sired by Authorized), won four races *Bounding (bay filly, 2011, by Exceed and Excel) PedigreeReferences Category:2005 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 4-k ","title":"Saoirse Abu"},{"id":"41865916","text":"The Hon.

Chemical structure  Glufosfamide is, basically, a glycosidic conjugate between Œ≤-D-glucose and the active alkylating moiety of the well-known antineoplasic drug ifosfamide, so- called \\"isophosphoramide mustard\\".  Theoretical advantages  Glufosfamide, being a conjugate of glucose and active alkylating moiety of ifosfamide, has the better cell permeability than the parent compound ‚Äî ifosfamide ‚Äî or its metabolites. Glufosfamide utilizes the normal cell glucose transport mechanism (a sodium-dependent glucose/sodium co-transporter) for its own transport into the cell. And the glucose uptake mechanism is grossly overexpressed and upregulated in certain cancer cell lines, especially pancreatic cancer, non- small cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme. This, theoretically, should render them more sensitive to the alkylating effects of glufosfamide while relatively sparing (doing relatively little collateral damage) to the normal cells in which the glucose uptake mechanism is not so upregulated.Glufosfamide: beta-D-Glc -IPM, D 19575.Drugs in R&D; 2005, 6 (1) :49-52, .

Biography Vrioni was member of Vrioni family, a major landowning family from the Ottoman cast. He was the main landowner in the Fier region. Born in Fier in 1885. He studied economics public administration in Istanbul. Qemal Vrioni was a participant at the Congress of Durr√´s in December 1918. He was Assemblyman of Albanian Parliament during 1921-1928. He was involved in the anti-Zogist Uprising of Fier in 1935. Unlike other organizers like Costa Chekrezi, Musa Kranja, or Xhevahir Arapi who fled the country or were severely punished, he managed to come out unharmed. In 1938-1939 he was appointed in charge of SITA, an Italian corporation operating in Albania in the field of electrical equipment and infrastructure. He would be replaced later by Salih Bey Vu√ßit√´rni. In 1940, during the Italian Occupation he took over the direction of the Tomorri newspaper, a fascist media which succeeded Fashizmi (Fascism). He was Minister of Finance in the government of Shefqet V√´rlaci of 1940 succeeding Fejzi Alizoti. At the end of World War II he was arrested by the Albanian Partisans, proceeded at the Special Court of Spring 1945 which handled many previous politicians at that time. He was initially sentenced to death as \\"war criminal\\" and \\"enemy of the people\\", but later the charge was changed to prison time. According to Elsie, he died in Burrel prison in 1946. According to Aliko, he was condemned to 10 years of imprisonment, and released in 1952, being persecuted ever after. All the properties and estates were confiscated. Vrioni was accused during the 1920s for brutal behavior towards his estates' peasants, including driving them out of his land and burning their homes. He was unsuccessfully brought to court for that.

It is located 4 kilometres east of the village of Carsluith in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland (). The tombs are scheduled monuments in the care of Historic Scotland. The name Cairnholy represents Gaelic *C√†rn na h-ulaidhe ‚Äòcairn of the stone tomb‚Äô. Description The Cairnholy tombs are situated on a hillside overlooking Wigtown Bay. They are situated next to Cairnholy Farm. The site can be accessed at the end of a minor road about 1 kilometre from the A75 road. The two tombs lie within 150 metres of each other.Cairn Holy Chambered Cairns, Historic Scotland, accessed 6 February 2014 Both tombs lie open to the sky as most of their original covering stones have been taken in the past to build field walls. Both tombs were partially excavated in 1949 by Stuart Piggott and Terence Powell. Finds from the excavations are in the National Museum of Scotland. Cairnholy I Cairnholy I, fa√ßade Cairnholy I () is the more elaborate of the two tombs. It measures 50 by 15 metres and has a monumental curving fa√ßade, that formed the backdrop to a forecourt in front of the tomb. Excavation showed that several fires had been lit in the forecourt. The tomb itself has two chambers. The outer chamber, which was entered through the fa√ßade, contained a fragment of a jadeite ceremonial axe, together with sherds of Neolithic pottery and a leaf- shaped arrowhead. Late grave-goods comprised Peterborough-ware and Beaker-ware pottery sherds and a flint knife. The inner chamber was built as a closed box, and was inaccessible from the outer one. It was probably originally roofed by a great stone slab resting on the two taller end-slabs. The inner chamber contained a secondary cist, with food vessel sherds and a cup-and-ring carved stone. Cairnholy II Cairnholy II Cairnholy II () is located to the north of Cairnholy I. Local tradition maintains that it was the tomb of Galdus, a mythical Scottish king. It is from this tomb that the nearby farm takes its name. It measures 20 by 12 metres, and is less than 60 centimetres high. It has been robbed of stones but there are still two portal stones in front of the chambered tomb. There is a very shallow v-shaped forecourt at the front of the tomb. The tomb contained two chambers. The rear chamber had been previously robbed, and the other disturbed, but an arrowhead and a flint knife were found within the filling, along with secondary sherds of Beaker pottery. Other prehistoric monuments Around 160 metres to the east of Cairnholy farm is the remains of circular cairn less than 15 centimetres high (). When stones were being removed from it some time before 1849, it was found to contain human bones. The area is surrounded with rocks bearing cup and ring marks. Kirkdale Church Around 700 metres to the west are the ruins of Kirkdale Church. The church was dedicated to St Michael. Kirkdale, which belonged to Whithorn Priory, was originally a separate parish, which united with Kirkmabreck in 1618. The church is enclosed by an overgrown burial ground.

Under these conditions, assuming gravity and spacetime are quantized, there arises a repulsive 'force' derived from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The accumulation of mass-energy inside the Planck star cannot collapse beyond this limit because it violates the uncertainty principle for spacetime itself. The key feature of this theoretical object is that this repulsion arises from the energy density, not the Planck length, and starts taking effect far earlier than might be expected. This repulsive 'force' is strong enough to stop the collapse of the star well before a singularity is formed and, indeed, well before the Planck scale for distance. Since a Planck star is calculated to be considerably larger than the Planck scale, this means there is adequate room for all the information captured inside of a black hole to be encoded in the star, thus avoiding information loss. While it might be expected that such a repulsion would act very quickly to reverse the collapse of a star, it turns out that the relativistic effects of the extreme gravity such an object generates slow down time for the Planck star to a similarly extreme degree. Seen from outside the star's Schwartzschild radius, the rebound from a Planck star takes approximately fourteen billion years, such that even primordial black holes are only now starting to rebound from an outside perspective. Furthermore, the emission of Hawking radiation can be calculated to correspond to the timescale of gravitational effects on time, such that the event horizon that 'forms' a black hole evaporates as the rebound proceeds. The existence of Planck stars was first proposed by Carlo Rovelli and Francesca Vidotto, who theorized in 2014 that Planck stars form inside black holes as a solution to the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox. Confirmation of emissions from rebounding black holes could possibly provide evidence for loop quantum gravity. Recent work demonstrates that Planck stars may exist inside of black holes as part of a cycle between black hole to white hole.

The club was founded on 1 June 1999 out of a fusion of two clubs, Rood Wit-A and ASV Schellingwoude. The club hold a Sunday team, competing in the Derde Divisie (formerly Topklasse). History Rood Wit-A were founded on 13 April 1921 as VVA (Voetbal Vereniging Augustinus) joining the Katholieke Voetbalbund (Catholic football union). The name of the club was then changed to RKVVA, following the fusion of the IVCB and the KNVB, in order to tell them apart from VVA who were already competing in the KNVB. In 1957 the club merged with the gymnastics and handball clubs SVA and VDO, as well as the table tennis club KK (Katholieke Kring), becoming an Omni sports club by the name of RKSV Rood Wit Amsterdam. ASV Schellingwoude were founded on 23 July 1921 as VVS (Voetbal Vereniging Schellingwoude). The club competed in the NHVB at first, before joining the AVB, with both leagues being under the KNVB. A handball team was established as well during the club's 25th anniversary, and the name was subsequently changed to Amsterdamse Sportvereniging Schellingwoude. On 1 June 1999 the two clubs merged. The new team colors became red-blue-white, with the new name referring to the Schellingwouderdijk upon which the team's ground Sportpark Schellingwoude was built. In 2011 the club's Sunday team won their third consecutive championship, when the team was promoted for three consecutive seasons from the Vierde Klasse to the Eerste Klasse, followed by promotion to the Hoofdklasse. In 2016 they won entry to the Derde Divisie after finishing second. Team management ASV De Dijk are the first football club in Amsterdam to have a completely separate Management Column for \\"Team Development\\", working exclusively on the team's position in society as a sports club.

He was the son of Muhammad bin Musafir, the ruler of Tarum.  Conquest of Azerbaijan  In 941 Wahsudan and his brother Marzuban ibn Muhammad, with the tacit approval of their mother, deposed and imprisoned their father Muhammad, whose harsh governance had alienated many of his subjects. Wahsudan replaced Muhammad as the ruler of Tarum. Muhammad, however, was approached by Abu'l-Qasim Ja'far b. 'Ali, the vizier of the ruler of Azerbaijan, Daisam. Ja'far, who had fled Azerbaijan, offered Marzuban the chance to overthrow his master and take over the administration of the province. Ja'far, Marzuban and Wahsudan were all Isma'ilis, perhaps explaining Ja'far's decision to turn to them. In any case, Marzuban agreed and invaded Azerbaijan. Daisam's Dailamite troops defected to the Sallarid and Marzuban was able to occupy Ardebil and Tabriz, while Daisam fled to the Ardzrunids of Vaspurakan. Although Marzuban made Ja'far his vizier, the latter began to fear for his position. He went to Tabriz and invited Daisam to come there, then killed the Dailamite leaders of the city. Daisam returned and gained the allegiance of the Kurds, who were unhappy with Marzuban's administration. Marzuban and his Dailamites, however, defeated them and laid siege to Tabriz. He convinced Ja'far to leave Daisam's side; Ja'far was stripped of his position as vizier, although he was later reinstated. Daisam and his followers, however, managed to escape from Tabriz before it fell and made their way to Ardebil. Marzuban, with aid from his brother Wahsudan, besieged the town. He bribed Daisam's vizier to convince him to surrender, which he did in 942 or 943. Daisam was allowed to take charge of Marzuban's castle in Tarum. The people of Ardebil, however, were punished for their treason; a heavy tribute was forced upon them and they had to dismantle the town wall.  War against the Buyids and Kurdish tribes In around 948 Marzuban, angered by an insult his envoy had received from the Buyid amir of Jibal, Rukn al-Dawla, decided to take the city of Ray as punishment. Rukn al- Dawla managed to delay Marzuban's campaign through diplomatic means, giving him time to gather reinforcements from his brothers. At Qazvin Marzuban's army was defeated and he was captured. The Dailamite officers who had managed to escape from the battle at Qazvin decided to rally around Marzuban's father Muhammad, who was still in prison. They released him and occupied Ardebil, but Muhammad soon alienated them and was forced to flee to Tarum. Wahsudan imprisoned him and sent Daisam to Azerbaijan, in the hopes that he could aid the sons of Marzuban against an army sent by Rukn al-Dawla and led by Abu Mansur Muhammad. The latter soon decided to withdraw, allowing Daisam to take over Azerbaijan. This momentary weakness in the central administration allowed the Rawadids and Shaddadids to take control of the areas to the northeast of Tabriz and Dvin, respectively. In 953, Marzuban escaped from prison and sent an army to remove Daisam from power. The Sallarid army defeated him near Ardebil and forced him to flee to Armenia. In 954/5 Marzuban made peace with Rukn al-Dawla, who married his daughter. He also reestablished his rule in other parts of Azerbaijan. He expelled the Shaddadids from Dvin; the Rawadids kept their territory but were forced to pay tribute.  Struggle for supremacy and death  Wahsudan had been designated by his brother Marzuban as his successor. When Wahsudan came to Azerbaijan, however, the commanders of the fortresses refused to surrender to him, recognizing instead Marzuban's son Justan I ibn Marzuban I as his successor. Unable to establish his rule in the province, Wahsudan returned to Tarum; Justan was recognized as ruler in Azerbaijan, with his brother Ibrahim I ibn Marzuban I made governor of Dvin. Justan seems to have been interested primarily in his harem, a fact which alienated some of his supporters, although he and Ibrahim successfully put down a revolt by a grandson of the caliph al-Muktafi in 960. Shortly afterwards Justan and another brother, Nasir, came to Tarum, where they were treacherously imprisoned by Wahsudan, who sent his son Isma'il to take over Azerbaijan. Ibrahim raised an army in Armenia to oppose Isma'il, prompting Wahsudan to execute Justan, his mother and Nasir. Ibrahim was driven out of Azerbaijan by Isma'il, but retained his rule in Dvin. Isma'il died in 962, however, allowing Ibrahim to occupy Azerbaijan. He then invaded Tarum and forced Wahsudan to flee to Dailaman. In 966, Wahsudan defeated Ibrahim, and was further joined by the latter's deserted soldiers. Ibrahim then fled to his brother-in-law, the Buyid Rukn al-Dawla, while Wahsudan installed his son Nuh in Azerbaijan. Rukn al-Dawla sent an army under his vizier to reinstate Ibrahim in Azerbaijan, and Wahsudan was ejected from Tarum for a time. In 967 however he again sent an army, which burnt Ardabil before Ibrahim concluded a peace with his uncle, ceding part of Azerbaijan to him. Wahsudan shortly died after that, and was succeeded by Marzuban II ibn Ismail.

Many of her publications and philanthropic activities were centered on the research, restoration, and exhibition of art by women in Florence, Italy. Writing Fortune was the cultural editor of The Florentine, an English-language newspaper in Tuscany, in which she appeared as a regular art and culture columnist from the newspaper's founding in 2005 until her death in 2018. Her original column, Mosaics (2005‚Äì2008), led to her writing a guidebook on the culture of Florence, To Florence, Con Amore: 77 Ways to Love the City (The Florentine Press, 2007). The book's second edition, reprinted three years later with 13 additional chapters, is entitled To Florence, Con Amore: 90 Ways to Love the City (The Florentine Press, 2011). Fortune's subsequent books, documentaries, and essays were influenced largely by her efforts to safeguard and promote art by women artists. Her book, Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence (2009), documents women painters in Florence and their thousands of works on display or in storage, many of which are in need of restoration.Duranti, Elena. \\"Indiana Jane e i capolavori femminili perduti\\", La Nazione, November 6, 2009. pp. 8‚Äì9 In 2009, the book was presented to the Uffizi Library.

In 2006, under Fortune's leadership, The Florence Committee funded the restoration a painting in the San Marco Museum, Lamentation with Saints, a large-scale Renaissance painting by Suor Plautilla Nelli, Florence's earliest recognized woman painter to that date. In 2008, her quest continued with the restoration of David and Bathsheba by seventeenth- century Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi. Following up on these achievements, but wishing to work on a broader scope, in 2009, Fortune founded the American 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Advancing Women Artists Foundation (AWA), dedicated to researching, restoring, and exhibiting art work by women artists, particularly in Florence, Italy. Other projects in Florence Since Fortune founded the Advancing Women Artists Foundation (AWA) in 2009, it has carried out several restoration projects for drawings, paintings, and sculptures by women artists in Florence from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries including Dominican convent painter Suor Plautilla Nelli at the San Salvi's Last Supper Museum, eighteenth-century Florentine poet-painter Irene Parenti Duclos at the Accademia Gallery and nineteenth- century French sculptor F√©licie de Fauveau in Santa Croce, and Santa Maria del Carmine. The foundation also sponsors exhibitions, conference, seminars, books, and documentaries to promote the achievements of historic women artists, in addition to safeguarding their work. The foundation sponsors an honors program, 'The Nelli Awards', dedicated to recognizing modern-day women working in Florence, including women curators, artists, and restorers. In 2010, Fortune established the Jane Fortune Research Program at the Medici Archive Project in Florence, for finding new archival documents regarding the history of women artists, assisting study of this material by scholars, and mentoring young scholars in the field.

Three Carnegie libraries were built in New Mexico, in Las Vegas; Raton; and Roswell. The Raton library was demolished, the Roswell library is a vacant office building, and the Las Vegas library is still in use.  Origin  The Library's origin dates back to 1895, when a group of local women formed the Roswell Women's Club to obtain reading materials for themselves and their families. As their collection grew, the Women's Club opened a reading room in 1897. In 1900, the club began the application process to obtain a grant to build a library from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Two basic grant requirements were free title to the construction site and a maintenance fund equaling 10 percent of the grant. The club was thwarted by Carnegie's reluctance to consider applications from women. In 1902, a mill levy was passed by the male voters of the town to fund the library's maintenance. In 1904, a lot was purchased for $700 as a result of fund raising efforts by the Women's Club. In addition to this grant, the library received funding from James Hagerman, an investor in the railroad and irrigation industries in the Pecos Valley. Willa Skipworth was one of the first librarians, widow of Dr. Edwin Skipworth, a prominent doctor in the area. She went on to hold that position for fifteen years. The library operated on the maintenance funds until 1940 when a bond issue of $30,000 was passed by Roswell voters to remodel the library. Another bond issue for $50,000 was approved in 1950. All remodeling was completed by 1952, adding 5,100 square feet to the library. Recent history By 1960, the population of Roswell had grown to 30,000. Due to its small size, the Carnegie library quickly succumbed to pressures of overcrowding by patrons and limited space for collections. Failed bond issues for a new library in Roswell were proposed in 1968 and 1970. It wasn't until 1976 that a bond issue was successfully passed by Roswell voters. In 1978, the new library was built and opened, and the Roswell Carnegie Library was closed. The original Carnegie Library building was most recently renovated in 1992 to serve as office space. The building's exterior, original floors, and large windows help to preserve the history of the building. The privately owned building is currently being sold through an auction that closes February 28, 2014. The library's new location at 301 N. Pennsylvania is a 22,000 sq.ft. facility that houses over 150,000 items, including books, cds, DVDs, audio books, magazines, and e-books. As a full service library, it offers computer access, online databases, and wireless Internet access. It also has a large children's area with a diverse collection and many scheduled activities. The library has grown and continues to serve the Roswell community long after the original Carnegie facility outlived its usefulness.

Background The most notable use of a sealed train was the return of Vladimir Lenin to Russia from exile in Switzerland in 1917 - in fact that journey was not a true sealed train example because the passengers disembarked to, for example, spend the night in Frankfurt - but the practice was used a number of times throughout the 20th century to allow the migration or transport of controversial individuals or peoples.

R. Kinghorn, was an Australian naturalist, a longtime curator at the Australian Museum, and a noted lecturer and broadcaster. Early years Roy Kinghorn was born in Richmond, New South Wales, the youngest of three children of Rev. James Kinghorn (1861‚Äì1912) and his wife (Bertha) Ethel, n√©e Campbell (ca.1866‚Äì1942). He was educated at Ellengowan School, Bathurst, All Saints' College, Bathurst and the Sydney Church of England Grammar School.Rose Docker, 'Kinghorn, James Roy (1891‚Äì1983)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 2007, accessed online 7 February 2014 In 1907 he was accepted as a cadet at the Australian Museum, Sydney, specialising in crustaceans. He attended lectures at Sydney University and studied part-time at Sydney Technical College, but after failing an examination at the College, was transferred to a clerical position at the Museum. Wartime and later career Kinghorn enlisted with the AIF in June 1915 and served during World War I in Egypt and Lemnos with the Dental Corps and with the Field Artillery Brigade, mostly as a driver, but after receiving a severe knee injury in December 1917 was repatriated to Australia, and was discharged as permanently medically unfit in July 1918. He was to serve as recruiting officer for the 2nd AIF during the Second World War. He returned to the Australian Museum in 1918 and was appointed zoologist in charge of reptiles and amphibians; three years later birds were added to his portfolio. He was appointed Assistant Director of the Australian Museum around 1951 and retired in 1956. Lecturer and broadcaster Kinghorn was a popular and prolific lecturer on zoological subjects, beginning around 1924. His interest in broadcasting began around the same time, with talks and stories on the Children's Hour on Farmer's Radio Service (later 2FC). A fore-runner of the ABC Children's Hour ‚Äì 2FC became part of the ABC in 1932. Among his last media appearances was (as \\"Linnaeus\\" the naturalist) in a weekly spot during the last decade of ABC radio's Argonauts' Club. He was a regular on Captain Fortune Show, a pioneering TV series of the 1950s and the \\"Spying on Nature\\" segment of \\"Wednesday Wonderbox\\" children's show on ABC-TV (which also featured Mr. Squiggle) in the 1960s.

The USAF military installation produced motion pictures and still photographs for the United States Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) from 1947‚Äì1969. The 100,000 sq ft (9,300m) facility was built on 2.5 acres in 1941 as a World War II air defense center to coordinate Los Angeles area radar installations. When the studio was established in 1947, its purpose was kept secret. The studio consisted of one large sound stage, a film laboratory, two screening rooms, four editing rooms, an animation and still photo department, sound mixing studio, and numerous climate controlled film vaults. Using the latest equipment, the studio could process both 35mm and 16mm color motion picture film as well as black and white and color still photographs. It was declared Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument number 1098 in 2015. 1947‚Äì1960 Beginning with Trinity, the very first nuclear test in 1945, there was an obvious need to document nuclear testing with still and moving pictures photography. The film was needed for the study and understanding of the behavior of nuclear weapons. In 1946, in support of Operation Crossroads, the first atomic bomb test in the Pacific, the joint task force conducting the test had pulled together a provisional photographic unit of still and motion picture photographers to document the test. Most of these photographers were part of a small detachment of the 1st Motion Picture Unit from Long Island, New York. Operation Sandstone nuclear detonation At the conclusion of Operation Crossroads, it was determined that a permanent photographic unit, providing specialized photography and sound recording, should be established, trained, equipped and organized to obtain scientific, technical and documentary photography of recurring atomic bomb tests. Brigadier General P.T. Cullen, who had commanded the Air Photo Unit on Operation Crossroads, was directed to find a site in the Los Angeles area suitable for the accomplishment of motion picture documentation of Joint Task Force 7 (JTF-7), Operation Sandstone. After an extensive survey of the Los Angeles area, the General chose the Air Force facility at 8935 Wonderland Avenue. The facility had been constructed on two acres of land in 1943 at a cost of $132,000 to house the Los Angeles Flight Control Center. After World War II, the Los Angeles Flight Control Center was closed and the grounds and building declared surplus to the needs of the Air Force. In the fall of 1947 the 1352d Motion Picture Squadron was activated at Lookout Mountain. In January, 1948, the building was acquired from the War Assets Administration by the Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission for the Lookout Mountain Laboratory for use in support of JTF-7. Extensive remodeling commenced by the Los Angeles Office of the Army Corps of Engineers and was paid for by the AEC. One major modification was to install five individual fireproof vaults with a storage capacity of 3,500,000 feet of 35mm film. Office equipment came from Air Force supply at San Bernardino, CA and technical equipment, in excess of $500,000, was obtained from the First Motion Picture Unit in New York and various Air Force photographic units. During the period when Lookout Mountain Laboratory was used in support of JTF-7, it was under the command of the Second Air Division, which was commanded by General Cullen of the Strategic Air Command. Personnel consisted of 8 officers from the Air Force, USA, Navy and Marine Corps. Civilian photographers with Top Secret clearances were supplied by the Air Materiel Command and the Strategic Air Command on a Temporary duty assignment (TDY) basis, their salaries paid jointly by the AEC and the Air Force. In the fall of 1949, Lt. General Curtis LeMay decided that the production of motion pictures was not a proper function of the Strategic Air Command. Lookout Mountain Laboratory and all its staff were transferred to the Air Proving Ground under the command of Lt. General William E. Kepner. In December, 1949, Lookout Mountain Laboratory and the 4881st Motion Picture Squadron were assigned the responsibility for accomplishing all documentary photography for Joint Task Force 3, Operation Greenhouse. This was the first time that a photographic unit, specifically staffed and equipped for documentation of an atomic weapons test, existed during the planning stages of such test. As a result, it was possible to pre-plan the photography. In June, 1950, the Atomic Energy Commission, later the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), made funds available for further construction at Lookout Mountain Laboratory. Between June, 1950 and January 1, 1953 a new 100,000 square foot building was constructed, new motion picture processing equipment installed, more humidity controlled film vaults built, editing and screening rooms updated, a new still processing lab build and a sound stage added to the multistory building, much of which was underground having been built down into the mountain. It was agreed that the AEC would have the privilege of storing all existing AEC film pertaining to atomic weapons tests and development programs at Lookout Mountain free-of-charge. In 1953, the new Lookout Mountain Lab facility had an estimated value of $1,500,000. Formation of 1352nd Motion Picture Squadron The production credit image from a film produced by United States Air Force Lookout Mountain Laboratory On April 1, 1951 the Air Force established the Air Pictorial Service (APS) with the primary photo unit being the 4881st Motion Picture Squadron. All photography of atomic bomb tests was quickly transferred from the Air Proving Ground to the Air Pictorial Service which was under the command of Military Air Transport Service (MATS). On April 16, 1952 the Air Pictorial Service was redesignated the Air Photographic and Charting Service (APCS). APCS was responsible for mapping the world and providing accurate aerial charts to military aviators of wherever they needed. It also produced all Air Force training films, public information films and monthly newsreels. On April 28, 1952, the 4881st Motion Picture Squadron was redesignated the 1352nd Motion Picture Squadron, effective on May 1, 1952. The mission of the newly formed 1352nd Motion Picture Squadron was: \\"...to provide in-service production of classified motion pictures and still photographs for the Department of the Air Force in support of the Atomic Energy program and to provide such additional production of motion picture and still photography as directed by the Commanding General, Air Pictorial Service.\\" 1958‚Äì1969 Lookout Mountain photographer on camera mount. A re-purposed M45 Quadmount In March 1958, Lookout Mountain Laboratory was redesignated Lookout Mountain Air Force Station. On July 1, 1960 the 1352d Motion Picture Squadron was re- designated as the 1352d Photographic Group with headquarters at Lookout Mountain Air Force Station (LMAFS), 8935 Wonderland Ave, Los Angeles, CA. The offices of the Commander, Executive, Administrative, Comptroller, Manpower, Procurement, Base Supply, Civilian and Military Personnel, and Information Office were located at the \\"Annex\\" at 10850 Riverside Drive, Suite 208 of the North Hollywood Federal Building in North Hollywood. In January, 1966 the Military Air Transport Service became the Military Airlift Command (MAC) with headquarters at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. The Air Photographic and Charting Service became the Aerospace Audio Visual Service (AAVS) with headquarters at the 1365th Photographic Group, Orlando, AFB, Florida. In March, 1967, the 1352nd Photographic Group was composed of two squadrons, four Detachments (Det) and two Operating Locations (O/L). The squadrons were the 1369th Photo Sq. at Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA and the 600th Photo Sq, Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Saigon, South Vietnam. The Detachments and Operating Locations were: Det. 2 1352d Colorado Springs, CO, Det. 3 1352d Hickham Air Force Base, Hawaii, Det. 4 1352d El Segundo, CA, Det. 7 1352d March Air Force Base, CA, O/L 1 1352d Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, O/L 1 Det. 3 Yamato, AS, Japan. From 1960 to 1969, the 1352d Photo Group, Lookout Mountain Air Force Station, was responsible for all documentary photographic capabilities and the maintenance and operation of laboratories and production facilities in the western part of the United States (west of the Mississippi River), the Pacific and the Far East. Productions Production still from the film Operation Greenhouse In an average year, Lookout Mountain produced 150 reels of finished film, a reel being 10 minutes of film, or roughly 35‚Äì40 finished films. In addition, Lookout Mountain provided film input for the monthly Air Force Newsreel, shown to Air Force personnel around the world, and briefing films for HQ USAF and unclassified film clips for the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information (SAFOI) to distribute to TV media from film received daily from the 600th Photo Squadron documenting Air Force combat operations in Vietnam. Many of the Film Reports, Training Films and Special Film Projects featured well known Hollywood actors and voice-over narrators. Among those who have starred in Air Force films shot at \\"the Hill,\\" as Lookout personnel called the studio, were: Reed Hadley, Bob Hope, Jimmy Stewart, Robert Preston, James Garner, Juliet Prowse, Gregory Peck, Keenan Wynn, Marvin Miller, Les Tremayne, Kim Novak, Glenn Ford and Lee Marvin.\\"The Lookout Mt.

Johnson, 1352nd Photographic Group, LMAFS, December, 1966-March, 1968 Among Special Film Projects were films like ' which told the story of a squadron of F-105 pilots who flew to North Vietnam to bomb strategic targets and often had to fight their way in and out against North Vietnamese MIGS. USAF Combat Photography In Southeast Asia which told the story of the 600th Photo Squadron whose combat photographers documented Air Force operations in South Vietnam and which included the rescue of down pilots from North Vietnam. A Night On Jackrabbit Mesa, explained to civilian authorities, police, fire and rescue, how to secure and handle the crash of an Air Force plane. Escape and Evasion, taught downed pilots how to evade the enemy and live off the land until rescued. For years, at Christmas, the Air Force provided Bob Hope with air and logistical support for his annual Christmas tours to Vietnam to entertain the troops. As part of this support, Lookout Mountain Air Force Station provide 35mm film equipment and film crews to document Hope's tours. His tours were later broadcast on NBC as Bob Hope Specials. Lookout Mountain Air Force Station also supported the AEC with documentation of underground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), Mercury, NV. Beginning in 1951 with Operation Ranger, the first series of atmospheric tests at NTS, photographers from the 1352 Photographic Squadron and the U.S. Army Signal Corps began experimenting with different photographic methods from high-speed to wide-screen. Nuclear tests were filmed in 35mm and 16mm color, in Cinemascope, VistaVision, and even 3-D. One of the last underground nuclear tests covered by Lookout Mountain crews was Midi Mist in June, 1967. Between 1946 and 1969, Lookout Mountain studio produced more than 6,500 films for the Atomic Energy Commission and other government agencies. Many of these films remain classified.

The studio employed many talented civilians as producers, writers, directors, cameramen, editors and animators. Many of these \\"old timers\\" had worked at Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal and RKO Pictures.\\" In addition, many of the producers and directors were veterans of Frank Capra's World War II film unit, or had been with combat photo teams of the Army, Navy and Marines. W. Donn Hayes (1893‚Äì1973), who coined the name American Cinema Editors (ACE), was the past president of the Motion Picture Editors Guild and worked at Lookout Mountain as his last career assignment. Hayes had been in the film and television industries since 1916. Among his credits were Tarzan Escapes (1936), Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), and Li'l Abner (1940). Another Lookout Mountain editor, William \\"Bill\\" Holmes (1904‚Äì1978) had edited 54 feature films at Warner Bros. Holmes' credits included: Ben Hur (1925), I Was A Fugitive From A Chain Gang (1932), Dark Victory (1939), They Died With Their Boots On (1941) and Sergeant York, for which he won the 1941 Academy Award for Best Editing. Barry Shipman (1912‚Äì1994), one of Lookout Mountain's writers, had written serials for Universal Pictures including Dick Tracy (1937) and Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe (1940), and had written for such TV series as Lassie, Ramar of the Jungle, Adventures of Wild Bill Hicock and Death Valley Days.Internet Movie Data Base ‚Äì IMDb 1966‚Äì1975 In 1966 the 1352 Photographic Group took on a new role, the documentation of the growing war in Vietnam. On the 8th of February 1966, Det. 5, 1352 Photographic Group at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam became the 600th Photo Squadron charged with the increased responsibility of all USAF photographic services in Southeast Asia except reconnaissance photography. This responsibility grew over the years to include combat documentation, automatic gun-camera and high-speed pod and blister photography of ordnance deliveries, still photography, and photographic support of the Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF). Between 1966 and 1976, the 600th Photo Squadron lost 11 combat cameramen killed-in-action. Four were killed in 1968 at the height of U.S. combat operations in Vietnam. Deactivation In June, 1968, the 1352d Photographic Group at Lookout Mountain Air Force Station was discontinued and all personnel and equipment was relocated to Norton Air Force Base, CA. HQ AAVS relocated to Norton Air Force Base in July 1968. The 1360th Photographic Squadron, the USAF'S Film Depository, also relocated to Norton Air Force Base from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in July 1968. The Air Force's film depository houses over 100 million feet of 16mm and 35mm color motion picture film.LENSMAN ‚Äì October, 1969 ‚Äì Official newspaper of the Aerospace Audio Visual Service. Private use The facility was decommissioned and sold. The property was purchased at auction for $50,000. Dehl Berti, an American Indian producer, was perhaps the second private owner of the property. He struggled to keep the property and his films afloat in the late 70's-80's. With the purchase he had a full sound stage and production facility but did not include the a canon-gun pillbox structure, meant for defense of the facility, at the end of the mountain . The sound stage still had the maps of the planned flight patterns painted on the floor. A former base employee reported that these maps were used by the film crew to identify A-bomb targets as they would look to pilots from the air. He also implied that the same sound stage was used to photoshoot a moon landing back-up, in the case of transmission failure of the original landing. Berti began the addition of a two story swimming pool which could be viewed through thick glass windows in the former underground film development lab cum party room, as well as installing private showers in some of the rooms. Berti went broke and the property was repossessed by Berti's Orange County lender in the early 80's. Phil Seiflein, a local Real Estate developer, optioned the property in the mid-80's but lost control of it while traveling when his partners failed to exercise his $500,000 option and then failed to bid on it. A computer developer purchased it at auction in the mid-80's for $550,000 and completed redevelopment of the property into a liveable facility. It was resold again in 1994 for $750,000 to artist Mark Lipscomb and attorney and former judge John Ladner. It has been a private residence for many years. In 2011, the property was put up for sale for over $6 million (USD). When it was placed up for sale in 2011, the facility was a 50 thousand square foot, eight bedroom residence on a 1.5 acre property. As of November, 2012, the former Air Force film studio and laboratory had been leased by the One80Center as a rehab center which, according to broker/blogger Jimmy Bayan, will be used to \\"house up to 18 residents at a time, who will dish out up to $50,000 per month to live and recover in this historic treasure.\\" In January 2015, Academy Award- winning actor Jared Leto purchased the property for USD$5 million.

The company also operates a chain of retail stores, with 69 locations as of September 2020.  History  5.11 Tactical started in Modesto, California as a clothing line created by mountain climber Royal Robbins. Upon reaching the top of a climb in Yosemite California, he noticed that the trousers that he was wearing were not suited for climbing. Robbins decided that he needed to design something more durable and with better functionality. He owned a boot and clothing company and began manufacturing pants by the name of \\"5.11\\" that had a trademarked tactical strap and slash pocket design in 1968. The name \\"5.11\\" comes from the highest rock climbing difficulty level that was listed in the Yosemite Decimal System at Yosemite National Park, which was developed by Robbins in the 1950s. The difficulty level is somewhat jokingly defined as, \\"After thorough inspection, you conclude this move is obviously impossible; however, occasionally someone actually accomplishes it\\". Robbins sold a 51% stake in his company to Dan Costa in 1999, who, after much streamlining, noticed that the 5.11 Tactical pants were becoming popular at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Costa bought the entire company in 2002 and ended up selling Royal Robbins Clothing back to Robbins in 2003, but kept the 5.11 Tactical brand and spun off a whole new company called 511 Inc or 5.11 Tactical. Partnering with the FBI, Dan Costa and his co-partner Francisco Morales began creating additional tactical apparel and improving on the existing line. In 2006 5.11 Tactical was ranked No. 211 on Inc. magazine's list of the 500 fastest- growing companies in the nation. TA Associates, a Boston private equity firm, bought a majority stake in 5.11 Tactical for $305 million in 2007. In 2012, 5.11 Tactical purchased Seattle-based custom outdoor apparel brand, Beyond Clothing LLC, for an undisclosed amount. An April Fool's joke that same year resulted in production of the Tactical Duty contemporary kilt. Also in 2012, the company announced it was moving development jobs to Irvine, California, while leaving some functions in Modesto. In 2014, the company expanded into retail and opened pilot locations in Riverside and Las Vegas, and the following two years it opened stores in California, Colorado, Texas, Australia, Florida and Utah. In 2016, the company was acquired by Compass Diversified Holdings for US$401 million.  Retail stores  The company operates a chain of 69 retail stores across 25 U.S. states, Germany, Australia, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Ireland and Japan, as of September 2020. In 2020 they have continued their announced plan to open new stores with multiple locations under development and a plan to have 71 stores domestically by the end of 2020.  In popular culture  5.11 Tactical makes clothing, gloves, boots, holsters, knives, flashlights, slings, and packs for law enforcement use, but is popular with civilian shooters and private military contractors. Actress Jennifer Garner and her co-stars wore 5.11 watches in the 2007 film The Kingdom. Actor Ryan Philippe wore 5.11 tactical plate carriers in the television series Shooter. 5.11 is the official plate carrier of the CrossFit Games. 5.11 plate carriers are featured in the video game Escape From Tarkov. 5.11 products are featured in various Ubisoft video games including Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, Far Cry 5, Tom Clancy's The Division 2, and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint.

Bulatov was an activist and leader of the AutoMaidan, which was the mobile car-based arm of the anti-government Euromaidan movement. He is also in charge of the \\"Socially responsible society\\" NGO. Due to his activism, he was kidnapped and tortured outside the villas of Ukrainian government and business figures. Biography Dmytro Bulatov is a graduate of the National Technical University of Ukraine \\"Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\\". In 2001, he graduated from the Electronics Department with a degree in Engineering of Microelectronics and Semiconductor Devices. Between 1998 and 2014, Dmytro Bulatov had his own business and held key positions in state and private companies. He worked as the Director of the Tsentr-K Private Enterprise (1998-2003, hotel industry), as the Chief of Q-Service Group of Companies (2003-2007, marketing, advertisement and design), as the Deputy Director of ITERA Group of Companies (2007-2008, building activity), the Director of ‚ÄúPromlohistyka‚Äù LLC (2008-2009, metallurgy), and as the Director of ‚ÄúTorhovo-Promyslovyi Holding‚Äù LLC (2009-2010, oil and gas trade). In conjunction with this, he held consulting activities in the areas of marketing, advertisement and sales. Between 2010 and 2013, he was the owner of Stolnik Autocenter, but after certain events, the business vector was changed and Bulatov began to work mainly in consulting. Between May and October 2010, he worked as the Director of the ‚ÄúUkrrybproekt‚Äù Designing Institute for Fisheries and Fishery Industry and in the State Committee of Fishing of Ukraine under the Ministry of Agrarian Policy of Ukraine. During this half of the year, he turned the institute from a losing organisation to a profitable one. Dmytro Bulatov was also active in wakeboarding and took part in All-Ukrainian competitions. At the beginning of 2013, he created the ‚ÄúSocially Responsible Society‚Äù NGO. Together with the Ukrainian Philanthropists Forum, this organisation began the National Philanthropists Top List. In April 2013, Bulatov was one of the organizers of dismantling of alcohol sale points in Muromets Park in Kyiv. In September 2013, he agitated for the prohibition of alcohol festivals held at playgrounds. After Dmytro Bulatov‚Äôs son of 12 years old had gotten stuck in an open drain at the crossing of Zdolbunovska Street and Hryhorenka Street (Kyiv, Pozniaky Microdistrict) while riding a bicycle and had told about it to his father, Dmytro Bulatov, together with other activists, also came to grips with the problem of open drain covers. In autumn 2013, his organisation, at its own expense, covered dangerous open drain covers with grates and fibreglass lids that were made by Bulatov and his automobile repair shop. Such fibreglass lids were cheaper and could not be sent for scrap. Dmytro Bulatov continually appeared before mass media with an appeal to fix such lids. Dmytro Bulatov is married and has three children. AutoMaidan On November 30, 2014, Dmytro Bulatov found out about the forceful dispersal of Euromaidan and, together with his friend Oleksii Hrytsenko, decided to organise a car run across Kyiv in order to involve people in the protest. On the first day, about 300 drivers partook in the action. On the morning of December 1, Bulatov gathered with other participants (most notably Vasyl Futin, Tetiana Chornovol, Andrii Dzidzia, Volodymyr Kadura, and others) to delegate responsibility. This was the beginning of AutoMaidan. Bulatov was the organizer and took part in most of AutoMaidan‚Äôs actions, particularly in a drive to Mezhyhiria, in visits to other high-ranking person and troop leader of ‚ÄúBerkut‚Äù, and also in blocking of ‚ÄúBerkut‚Äù in Sviatoshynskyi District, Kyiv. Kidnapping On January 22, 2014, during Eurorevolution in Ukraine, the activists of AutoMaidan announced that Bulatov went missing. The last time Bulatov got in touch was the evening of January 22. On January 23, at approximate four o'clock in the morning, ‚ÄúBerkut‚Äù arrested a minimum of 15 activists of AutoMaidan who patrolled Hospital No. 17 in Kyiv and piled up nine cars. AutoMaidan announced a reward of ten thousand US dollars for information to help find Dmytro Bulatov and save his life. Subsequently, this amount was increased up to twenty-five thousand US dollars. On January 30, Bulatov got in touch with friends and claimed he had been kidnapped, and terribly tortured by captors who spoke with Russian accents. After these terrible tortures, he was brought outside the city and thrown out of a car. Bulatov managed to get to the Village of Vyshenky, Boryspil district.–ë—É–ª–∞—Ç–æ–≤ —Ä–æ–∑–ø–æ–≤—ñ–≤, —â–æ –π–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ–∑–ø–∏–Ω–∞–ª–∏ —ñ –≤—ñ–¥—Ä—ñ–∑–∞–ª–∏ –≤—É—Ö–æ and asked for help. The same day, Bulatov was admitted to the Boris Clinic, where he received first medical care. According to Petro Poroshenko, Dmytro Bulatov, Oleksandr Danyliuk, and Oleksii Hrytsenko (participant of AutoMaidan) were entered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine into the foreign travel ban list. This list was observed by the frontier guards. On February 2, Shevchenko District Court in the City of Kyiv rejected to uphold a motion of investigation to arrest Dmytro Bulatov. That same day, Bulatov went to Lithuania to be treated there in transit through Riga. On 6 February 2014, while undergoing treatment in Lithuania, Bulatov stated at a press conference in Vilnius that he was tortured to admit that his organisation was funded and aided by Americans and the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, especially, and that he was hired to organise the Automaidan and the riots against the current government. During the press conference, Bulatov repeatedly stressed that he believed he was abducted by the Russian special forces and that the leader of Ukrainian Choice, oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk, might have been involved in his abduction. After one session of torture, \\"they made me say into a camera that I was a spy for the United States, that I was a spy for the CIA, that Americans were giving me money, that Automaidan was funded by Americans, and that I was specifically hired to organize the Automaidan and the riots against the current government.\\" Bulatov also said: \\"After this torture, I said to the camera everything they asked me to say, and they recorded it all on video. I said that the U.S. ambassador gave me $50,000, which I used to buy gasoline for the Automaidan, to repair cars for the Automaidan activists, for whom I had bought several video cameras to film trips. That is, I lied only to get them to torture me less.\\" The kidnapping of Bulatov was widely condemned, including by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton.High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton. Fresh from medical care in Lithuania, Bulatov went to Germany to visit his relatives. On 15 February 2014, he held a press conference at Checkpoint Charlie Museum in Berlin where he again accused Medvedchuk of his kidnapping, but said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs only a suspicion.‚Äù He confirmed that he would re-join protests in Ukraine and would not seek asylum. On February 24, Dmytro Bulatov returned to Ukraine. Now, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine is carrying out an investigation into the kidnapping of Dmytro Bulatov. Operational-Investigations Group is investigating five cases, including intimidation in relation to social and political activity.

The historic district has 9 listed buildings, designed in the Victorian Queen Anne and Colonial Revival styles. Originally called the Montana State Soldiers' Home, and now the Montana Veterans' Home, the institution has served veterans since 1896. The mission of the home is, \\"to honor the service of Montana‚Äôs veterans by serving them in turn in their time of need.\\" It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.  History  In the 1890s, Montana had 25 Civil War veterans living on county poor farms, out of a total of 2,500 veterans. In 1895, the Montana State legislature responded to lobbying by the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.) and authorized the establishment of a soldiers' home. Columbia Falls was selected out of a group of eight communities. Its citizens donated $3,100. Additionally, 147 acres of land were donated by the Northern Improvement Co., a subsidiary of the Great Northern Railway. Charles S. Haire designed the old main building, which was built by Fred Whiteside, a builder and Montana politician, in 1896. Haire also designed a small hospital in 1900. The hospital became the Commandant's House in 1980. A new, larger hospital built in 1908 has since been demolished. The 1919 Service Building has a chapel, and housed the employees of the home. A cemetery was established in 1897. A new housing facility for veterans, the Montana Veterans' Home, was opened by Montana Governor Forrest H. Anderson at an official dedication ceremony in 1970. It provides housing and subsistence to veterans, and in some cases, to veterans' spouses. An E. M. Viquesney statue of a World War I doughboy was moved to the front of the Veterans' Home in 1972. The statue originally stood in front of the Flathead County Courthouse in Kalispell, in Main Street's median.

It takes its name from the free musical form Lament (Latin, lƒÅmentor), and from Borinquen, an indigenous name for the island. Hern√°ndez released the song in 1929 to illustrate the economic precariousness that had engulfed the Puerto Rican farmer since the late 1920s' Puerto Rico. It became an instantaneous hit in Puerto Rico and its popularity soon followed in may countries of Latin America. Renown international artists have sung it and featured it in their repertoire. Monument to the \\"Lamento Borincano,\\" in el Viejo San Juan In 2018, the original 1930 recording of the song by Canario y Su Grupo was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\\" History Hernandez composed the song while he lived in New York City, in Spanish Harlem. That same year, he also wrote his masterpiece, \\"Preciosa\\". In 1947, Hern√°ndez returned to Puerto Rico to become an orchestra director at the government-owned WIPR Radio.Hernandez Marin, RafaelRafael Hern√°ndez Mar√≠n. Encyclopedia Puerto Rico. 6 February 2014. Lamento Borincano was interpreted by dozens of artists and became an important part of Puerto Rican culture. In 1929, 17-year-old Davilita met Rafael Hern√°ndez by chance. Davilita got along quite well with Hern√°ndez Mar√≠n and was able to see the unfinished version of Hernandez's \\"Lamento Borincano\\". Davilita asked Hernandez if he could record the song but, Hernandez thought that Davilita was too young and declined his request. The song was to be recorded by bandleader Manuel \\"Canario\\" Jim√©nez and his band. A musician named Ramon Quiroz became ill on the day of the recording, so Davilita ended up as lead vocals, with Fausto Delgado on backup.music of Puerto Rico  Theme  The song reflects the economic situation of the poor farmers in the Puerto Rico of the 1920s decade leading to the Great Depression. The song starts with a cheerful and optimistic tone, presenting the j√≠barito. The j√≠barito (diminutive of J√≠baro) is a self-subsistence farmer and descendants of the intermixing of Ta√≠no and Spaniards during the XVI century, who is the iconic reflection of the Puerto Rican people of the day. The j√≠barito was a farmer-salesman who would also grow enough crops to sell in the town in order to purchase clothing, etc., for his family. The song speaks of the j√≠barito walking with his donkey loaded with fruits and vegetables from his plot of land and heading to town to sell his load but, disappointed to see the poverty prevalent even in town and unable to sell his load, the j√≠barito returns home with his load unsold. The song thus ends with a sad, melancholic tone. The song does not name Puerto Rico by its modern name, instead uses its former pre-Columbian name \\"Borinquen\\".Preciosa: The People, History, and Music of Puerto Rico. Mark U. Reimer.

She was purchased in Norway by the Polish shipping company Gdynia America Line and named after a Polish emigrants settlement in Brasil. Origins The ship was built as Consul Horn in Kiel in 1924 by Friedrich Krupp AG for the HC Horn shipping company, which operated her out of Hamburg. On 31 December 1927 the ship ran aground on Ven, Sweden. She was refloated on 4 January 1928. In 1934 she was acquired by the Knoll Shipping Company, registered in London and renamed as Hindhead. She was then acquired by A/S Sobral in 1936 and renamed Rio Negro, operating on shipping routes between Norway and South America. In 1938 she was acquired by the Polish shipping company Gdynia America Line, renamed as the Morska Wola and based in Gdynia. World War II In 1940, during the final days of the Battle of France, MS Morska Wola was in port in France, from which she escaped to the United Kingdom. She was then put to use in Northern Atlantic convoys. She took part in over 40 convoys, most notably, she was one of the ships who managed to escape, after the German heavy cruiser attacked convoy HX 84, thanks to the delaying action fought by the armed merchant cruiser . She returned to Poland at end of the war, operating on shipping routes to South America and the Levant. Post war In 1952 she was taken over by the Dalmor fishing company and converted to supply ship for fishing boats operating in the North Sea. As such she had capacity of 150 people. After six years of such work, she was crippled by damage and judged unworthy of repair. She was scrapped in 1959.

Early life Born in Arcoverde and raised in Caruaru, Cavalcanti joined Santa Cruz's youth setup in 1997, aged of 17. Released in 2000, he moved to Na√∫tico, but failed to impress. Managerial career Cavalcanti began his career after an invitation from Muricy Ramalho, at that time N√°utico first- team manager, and subsequently joined the youth team's staff. In 2006, after a year as Sport's assistant, he was appointed manager of Ulbra Ji-Paran√°, and went on to win two consecutive Campeonato Rondoniense titles with the club. Cavalcanti subsequently took over Brazsat FC during the 2008 season, winning the year's Campeonato Brasiliense Terceira Divis√£o. He subsequently joined Santa Cruz; initially an assistant to Lori Sandri, he became first-team manager after the latter's dismissal in early 2010. Cavalcanti left Santa in July 2010, and was named Am√©rica-RN manager on 13 September. Despite failing to avoid relegation, he remained in charge of the club until the following March, when he was dismissed. Cavalcanti subsequently managed Central, Icasa, Ypiranga-RS and Luverdense in the following two years, winning the Campeonato Mato-Grossense with the latter. Ahead of the 2013 season, he was appointed Mogi Mirim manager, taking the club to the semifinals of the year's Campeonato Paulista and being named the best manager of the tournament. On 6 May 2013, Cavalcanti was named manager of Paran√°. On 13 December, he was appointed manager of state rivals Coritiba for the 2014 campaign, but was sacked the following 31 March after being knocked out of the Campeonato Paranaense. On 13 April 2014, Cavalcanti took over Ponte Preta in the place of departing Vad√£o, but was relieved from his duties on 21 July. On 12 August, he was named in charge of first club N√°utico, leading the club to a 13th position in the S√©rie B. On 2 December 2014, Cavalcanti was announced as the new manager of fellow second division side Cear√°, being fired the following 12 February with only nine games in charge. Late in the month, he took over Paysandu; he won the 2016 Campeonato Paraense and the 2016 Copa Verde, but was sacked on 7 June 2016. On 1 August 2016, however, Cavalcanti was again appointed manager of Paysandu, remaining in charge of the club until the end of the campaign. On 2 December he was named at the helm of N√°utico, but left the club on 16 February of the following year. He subsequently managed CRB, only lasting three months in charge. Cavalcanti returned to Paysandu on 13 February 2018, but was sacked on 12 July. On 17 October, he returned to Paran√°, with the club seriously threatened with relegation. Cavalcanti was sacked from Paran√° on 2 April 2019, and was subsequently named manager of Bahia's under-23 squad late in the month.

Life and work Erskine studied Political Science at Yale University followed by Sculpture at University of Pennsylvania. He first encountered artists that used light as a medium when he moved to California in 1980. Erskine decided to combine light art with politics and highlight the growing environmental crisis, such as the destruction of the ozone layer and global warming. His work attempts to reveal the power and beauty of the sun, as well as humanity's precarious relationship with it. He uses prisms to allow the sun's light to be appreciated without having to look directly at it. Erskine moved to live at the CoHo Ecovillage, Corvallis, Oregon in 2007. Notable works * Secrets of the Sun: Millennial Mediations, Rome, Italy (1992) - created within the Roman Markets of Trajan. Erskine used physical and computer models to plan the light effects. * Sunrise, Essen, Germany (1999) - a heliostat was used to project light onto the city's Zollverein Coking Plant (now a museum). * New Light on Rome, Rome, Italy (2000) - Erskine projected light through prisms onto five of Rome's most important buildings, to mark the new millennium. * Inside a Diamond, CoHo Ecovillage, Corvallis, Oregon, USA (2011 ongoing) - light- refracting plastic panels were used to project light onto the communal spaces.

Life  His father, Franz Xaver, was a merchant in Mainz, and his mother Elisabeth was the daughter of a flagstone dealer. As a result of this connection, Edmund was apprenticed as a mason; a profession he practiced until 1865. His employer's brother was the animal painter, Johann Erdmann Gottlieb Prestel (1804-1885), who inspired him to become an artist. He began by dabbling in small murals at the local casinos. After six years of apprenticeship, he attended the Polytechnic School in Munich (precursor of the University of Technology) to study the building trades but, in 1866, he decided to follow his true passion and switched to the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, where he studied under Karl Raupp and Wilhelm von Lindenschmit the Younger. In addition to painting, he was also interested in illustrating and caricatures. In 1872 some of his first wood engravings appeared in a book by Friedrich Lennig, a dialect poet from Mainz. Later, he created political cartoons for Die Gartenlaube and, by the time of his death, had contributed over 1,500 humorous drawings to the Fliegende Bl√§tter. Harburger was particularly attracted to the works of the 17th-century Dutch painters, such as David Teniers the Younger and Adriaen van Ostade). From 1876 to 1878, he lived in Venice, where he copied the masters. In 1882, the firm of Braun & Schneider printed a large-format album, containing 60 of his works. Exhibitions were given at the Glaspalast, the Paris Salon (1882/84), the Academy of Arts, Berlin, and the Great Berlin Art Exhibition of 1905. He designed and built his own house in the Nymphenburger Stra√üe. Many of the major museums in Central and Northern Europe have displays of his drawings and engravings, including the Neue Pinakothek, the Landesmuseum Mainz, the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt and museums in Gdansk, Gothenburg, Leipzig, M√ºnster, Prague and Z√ºrich.

He was one of the biographer John Prince's Worthies of Devon. Origins Denys Rolle was the second but only surviving son of Sir Henry Rolle (died 1617) of Stevenstone by his wife Anne Denys, a daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Denys of Bicton and Holcombe Burnell by his wife Anne Paulet, daughter of William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester (1532‚Äì1598).Vivian, p.280, pedigree of Dennis of Holcombe Burnel His father pre-deceased his own father Sir Henry Rolle (1545‚Äì1625) of Stevenstone and thus Denys Rolle was heir to his grandfather. He was also heir to the large Denys estates of his mother, including Bicton. Career Rolle was according to most chroniclers a prodigy who died young at the age of 24 before his great potential was fulfilled. The Devon historian Tristram Risdon (died 1640) wrote of him: John Prince (1643‚Äì1723) called him Prince then relates an event in his life which illustrated his honourable disposition. Rolle loaned a large sum of money to Sir Bevil Grenville (1596‚Äì1643) in return for his written bond. Later when the two men were together in company, Rolle sent for the bond and threw it in the fire, stating that he had no need of a written bond and that Marriage and issue impaled by Rolle are visible on the monument to Denys Rolle in the Rolle Mausoleum, BictonImage of monument to Denys Rolle (died 1638) Rolle married Margaret Poulett, daughter of John Poulett, 1st Baron Poulett (1585‚Äì1649) of Hinton St George in Somerset (a distant cousin of Paulet, Marquess of Winchester) by his wife Elizabeth Kenn (died 1663).Vivian, p.653 On 1 September 1637 an agreement of mutual maintenance was signed by Rolle and his father-in-law and Elizabeth, Countess of Essex (died 1656), (Elizabeth Poulet, daughter of Sir William Poulet of Edington, Wiltshire, past High Sheriff of Wiltshire and cousin of William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester), second wife of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex (1591‚Äì1646), whom she had married in 1630 and separated from in 1631. She remained at Essex House in The Strand, London, whilst Robert \\"played soldiers\\" on his estates.) and Thomas Smyth, husband of Florence Poulett, sister-in-law of Rolle and mother of Sir Hugh Smith, 1st Baronet, which committed all parties to share a household for a period of seven years, stating the sums of money to be committed by each party. Each year's residence was to be divided between Hinton St George (Poulett seat), Bicton (Rolle seat) and Ashton (Long Ashton, Somerset, seat of Thomas Smyth).Catalogue entry by Bristol Record Office re document ref. AC/36074/73 . Transcript in Letters of John, 1st Lord Paulet to Thomas Smyth, Bristol Reference Library B/28176 He had by his wife the following issue:Vivian, p.653 *Dennis Rolle, died an infant *Florence Rolle, eldest daughter, baptised at St Giles in the Wood, the parish church of Stevenstone, on 27 February 1631. She married her cousin Sir John Rolle (1626‚Äì1706), of Marrais, who eventually inherited under tail-male the vast Rolle estates including Stevenstone and Bicton. *Margaret Rolle, 2nd daughter, married firstly Sir John Acland, 3rd Baronet (died 1655) of Columb John;Vivian, p.4 secondly Henry Ayshford (1639‚Äì1662)Vivian, p.24 of Ayshford in the parish of Burlescombe. *Anne Rolle, 3rd daughter, married William Cooke of Highnam in Gloucestershire *Elizabeth Rolle, 4th daughter, married William Strode, son of Sir George Stroud of Sussex,Prince, p.708 possibly descended from the ancient Devon family of Strode of Newnham, Plympton St Mary.Vivian, pp.718‚Äì20 *Frances Rolle (1635‚Äì1642), 5th daughter, died an infant aged 7 Death and succession Rolle was buried at Bicton on 13 June 1638.Vivian, p.653 His elaborate tomb monumentImage of monument to Denys Rolle (died 1638) with heraldic achievement Image of heraldic achievement of Denys Rolle (died 1638), Bicton Mausoleum is contained within the Rolle Mausoleum, the remnant of the former Parish Church of Bicton to the immediate east of which stands the new church of St Mary built in 1850. The Mausoleum is the private property of Lord Clinton and is not open to the public. The inscription on his monument was quoted by Swete and included a wish from his widow that their son should not die young.Swete, p.142 His widow's wish as stated on the epitaph was not met and the couple's son Dennis died soon after his father, leaving only daughters who were excluded from the inheritance by entail. The manor of Bicton, together with all the other Rolle estates including Stevenstone then passed to Henry Rolle (1605‚Äì1647) of Beam, near Great Torrington, the elder son of John Rolle (1563‚Äìpost 1628), MP, the uncle of Sir Henry Rolle (died 1617). He himself died without children and the Rolle estates, now increased by the addition of Beam, devolved following his death in 1647 upon his closest male cousin, 21-year-old Sir John Rolle (1626‚Äì1706), MP, of Marrais in the parish of St Mary Week, Cornwall. He was immediately thereupon married to his young cousin Florence Rolle of Bicton, one of the surviving daughters of Denys Rolle (died 1638).

Filmed at Wakefield Prison, it was commissioned for the purpose of educating people involved in criminal justice. The film was criticised for being inaccurate and sensational, and was quickly withdrawn. Production The film was made for educational purposes by the Central Office of Information to be shown privately to magistrates and others who were involved in administering criminal justice. The Home Office initiated production of the film, which cost ¬£16,000. It was one of three produced under Donald Taylor at the Crown Film Unit and completed in 1950. John Grierson was the producer and the film was directed by Max Anderson. Synopsis The film deals with penology. It is semi-documentary. It depicts the impact that living in prison has on four very different offenders. One is serving a short sentence for a first-time offence, one is a youthful thief who is mentally sub-normal, one is being given training to prevent him from turning into a habitual criminal and the fourth is a hardened criminal who knows the ropes of prison existence. Reception The film was aired for the first time at a magistrate's conference. The reaction was immediate and public, with the film condemned for inaccuracy and sensationalism. The magistrates said the first offender and the mentally defective thief would not in fact have been sentenced in jail. The film \\"disappeared under a ban of official disapproval.\\" Cast *William Mervyn *Arthur Mullard, Prison officer ReferencesSources   * External links * Category:1950 films Category:1950 documentary films Category:English-language films Category:Black-and-white documentary films Category:Documentary films about the penal system Category:British documentary films Category:British films Category:English films Category:British docufiction films Category:Penal system in England Category:Films directed by Max Anderson Category:Films set in England Category:1950 in England Category:Yorkshire in fiction Category:Wakefield ","title":"Four Men in Prison"},{"id":"41867737","text":"Euphorbia psammogeton, commonly known as sand spurge, is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. The specific epithet derives from the Greek psammos (‚Äúsand‚Äù) and geiton (‚Äúneighbour‚Äù), alluding to the typical habitat. Description E. psammogeton is a smooth, mat-forming, perennial herb, often with a woody rootstock. It has articulated, prostrate stems, growing to 35 cm or more. Its oblong to broadly elliptic leaves are 1‚Äì3 cm long and 0.5‚Äì1.5 cm wide, and asymmetric at the base. The tiny flower-heads are surrounded by white leaf-like bracts. Each flower-head consists of a female flower surrounded by up to five sets of tiny male flowers. The fruiting capsule is smooth and about 2 mm long. It flowers in spring/summer and fruits in autumn/winter. Distribution and habitat The plant is endemic to Australia; it is found along the coast of New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland, as well as on subtropical Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea. It occurs in sandy coastal habitats, such as coastal dunes, and on beaches above high tide level. It is listed as endangered in New South Wales. Taxonomy Euphorbia psammogeton was first described by Green (1993) as Euphorbia psammogeton. This was amended to Chamaesyce psammogeton by Forster and Henderson in 1995 and was returned to the genus Euphorbia by Halford in 2012, giving it the currently accepted name of Euphorbia psammogeton.

Originally established as Torpedo Squadron FIFTY EIGHT (VT-58) on 19 March 1946 at Naval Auxiliary Air Station Fentress in Chesapeake, Virginia, it was redesignated VA-1L on 15 November 1946 and ultimately disestablished on 20 November 1948. The squadron was the only one to receive the designations VA-1L or VT-58. History The squadron‚Äôs mission, when established, was to work with the navy's Operational Development Force (COMOPDEVFOR). That organization‚Äôs duties included the operational test and evaluation of new weapons, equipment and methods for use by the fleet; reporting the results; and recommending required training, operating procedures and tactical doctrine. To accomplish this mission, the squadron operated three different types: the F6F-5N Hellcat fighter aircraft, SB2C-5 Helldiver dive bomber and TBM-3 Avenger torpedo bomber, giving them a day and night capability. By the end of the year however, the fighter aircraft were transferred to the group's fighter unit, Fighter Squadron ONE L (VF-1L), and the now-redesignated attack squadron would focus on attack-oriented aircraft types for the duration of its establishment. The squadron was moved to Naval Air Station Atlantic City on 19 June 1946 and when the squadron received the TBM-3W airborne early warning aircraft in March 1947, it also received qualified personnel to support and operate the AEW TBM. In April and May 1947, the squadron operated aboard USS Saipan (CVL-48) during her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean, and in February the following year, TBM-3N and TBM-3E aircraft were embarked for deployment in the Caribbean about Saipan again, during which squadron aircraft participated in a fly-over during the inauguration ceremonies in Caracas, Venezuela for President-elect Romulo Gallegos. As part of Saipan's air wing CVLG-1, aircraft carried the tail code 'SA'. VA-1L became one of the first squadrons to receive the XBT2D-1, the initial prototype version of what would become better known as the Douglas A-1 Skyraider. Initial aircraft arrived in January 1948 and on October 19, production examples of the aircraft (designated AD-2). However, the squadron was disestablished shortly thereafter on 20 November 1948 with elements of the squadron joining elements of VF-1L to form Aircraft Development Squadron 3 (VX-3) which would serve in a similar role for the next twelve years before ultimately being disestablished itself on 1 March 1960. Home Port VT-58 was initially established at Naval Auxiliary Air Station Fentress in Chesapeake, Virginia, but only remained there for three months. Naval Air Station Atlantic City in New Jersey became its new home on 19 June 1946 and it would remain there until its disestablishment in 1948. Commanding officers Established under acting commander Lieutenant Dean S. Laird, little over a month would pass before the first commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Samuel G. Parsons would assume command of the squadron. LCDR John W. Shong became commander of the squadron on 20 August 1946 and would be the unit's longest-serving commander, handing over the squadron on 13 June 1948 to LCDR Laurence W. Abbott, Jr. who would see the squadron through to its disestablishment.

The Arkansas-Mississippi border follows the center of the narrow, curving lake. History Prior to 1942, the north-south flowing Mississippi River curved east into Mississippi, flowed along Tunica Lake (then called \\"Fox Island Bend\\" and \\"OK Bend\\"), and then continued its north-south route. In 1933, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began construction of 13 cutoffs along the lower Mississippi River. Previous cutoffs had been constructed along the river, and were of commercial benefit because they allowed ships to bypass lengthy U-shaped bends. Typically, cutoffs were created by digging a channel across a peninsula, leaving the bypassed bend to form an oxbow lake. Tunica Lake was created when the \\"Hardin Cutoff\\" was constructed across \\"Hardin Point\\" peninsula in 1942. It was the last cutoff constructed during that period. Communities All the communities near Tunica Lake are located in Mississippi. The present-day town of Austin was historically located directly along the east bank of Fox Island Bend. In 1884, the area was flooded when a nearby levee broke, and when the floodwaters receded, steamboats could no longer land because a large sandbar had been left between Austin and the Mississippi River. North of Austin is the community of \\"Fox Island\\". At the northern end of Tunica Lake is a small community with cottages, fishing camps, bait shops, an RV park, and four boatramps. Characteristics A small channel at \\"Shoo Fly Bar\\" on the south end of the lake connects to the Mississippi River. This channel permits spawning fish to enter Tunica Lake, and provides recreational boaters with access to the river. The channel also causes water levels in Tunica Lake to rise and fall along with the seasonal variations in water level in the Mississippi River. Fish species found in Tunica Lake include bowfin, bream (bluegill), buffalo, channel catfish, common carp, crappie, drum, flathead catfish, gar, green sunfish, largemouth bass, white bass, and yellow bass. Although the lake can be legally fished with either an Arkansas or Mississippi fishing license, all vehicles and most recreational boats can only access the lake from Mississippi. In popular culture Mississippi author Larry Brown mentioned the lake in his 2003 novel The Rabbit Factory: > It seemed his daddy had been dead forever now. He still thought about him > often, though, and about the times he'd taken him fishing for fat bluegills > at Tunica Cutoff. They used to catch piles of them.

He was murdered in the premises of the temple on 3 September 2004. The report by investigative journalist Dhanasekaran Prakash in the Tamil weekly Nakkeeran and the confession by the surrendered, lead to the arrest of Jayendra Saraswati and Vijayendra Saraswati, the seers of the Kanchi Mutt, a popular South Indian monastic institution. Sankararaman is alleged to have constantly leveled accusations against the Kanchi seers and the functioning of the Kanchi Mutt. He is alleged to have sent anonymous letters to the Mutt. The trial involved examining 189 witnesses during the trial period of 2009 to 2013, out of which 89 turned hostile. On 27 November 2013, all the 24 accused were acquitted by the Puducherry Principal District Session, quoting lack of incriminating evidence against them. The Puducherry court that pronounced the verdict on the trial noted that fair and proper trial was not performed in the case in the investigation, especially due to the active involvement of SP of Kanchipuram Premkumar IPS in the case beyond what is specified by law (Premkumar had tried to prevent Jayendra Saraswati from getting bail). Background alt=a pyramidal temple tower, with a four pillared dome in its foreground Sankararaman was the manager of Varadharaja Perumal Temple in Kanchipuram, a town in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Sankararaman constantly leveled accusations against the Kanchi seers and the functioning of the Kanchi Mutt. He is alleged to have sent anonymous letters to the Mutt. His father, Anantakrishnasharma was working closely with the 68th seer, Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi, the predecessor of Sri Jayendra Saraswathi. Sankararaman was an employee of the Mutt until the demise of Chandrasekarendra Saraswati in 1994. He detached himself from the mutt when Jayendra saraswathi became the head of the Mutt and he joined the Varadaraja Perumal temple as a manager. He was reported to be a stickler of tradition and he streamlined the assets and income of the temple. He suspended two of the temple priests when there was a robbery in the temple and refused to allow them until they paid the loss of 105,000. He made the tenants and land leasers of the temple pay the arrears amount. He filed a case in a court in 2000, against Jayendra Saraswathi visiting abroad nations, quoting that the seers of the Mutt cannot cross ocean, but can take land route. The Jagadguru cancelled the trip eventually. He was allegedly once not allowed to enter the Kamakshi Amman Temple along with his family in 2001 by the Mutt authorities. Sankararaman was murdered by a set of five gang men on 3 September 2004 in the premises of the temple using sharp weapons. While there were no eyewitnesses to the murder, the perpetrators presumably visited the house of Sankararaman an hour before to enquire about his whereabouts. His daughter, as per her statement in the court, revealed the incident. Key Accused Jayendra Saraswathi is the head of the Kanchi Mutt, one of a prominent Hindu monastic institutions in the country. An investigative journalist named Dhanasekaran Prakash in the Tamil weekly Nakkeeran alleged the reasons of the murder being the continuous infuriation by Sankararaman against Jayendrar and Kanchi Mutt. His report claimed that the letters were denting the image of the seer and the Mutt against prospective sponsors of the mutt. The report, which claimed that the murder was done at the behest of the seer and the confessions of some of accused who surrendered earlier brought Jayendrar into the spectrum of the case and necessitated his arrest. Appu alias Krishnaswamy was accused of utilizing his gang men for the murder of Sankararaman. Appu is believed to be associated with politicians from major parties and his criminal records have sandalwood smuggling and sand quarrying charges. He was arrested twice during 1996-2001 for those charges but was released immediately. Before the murder, he had nine pending cases against his name that included one murder and three attempts to murder. It was alleged that Appu directed five gang men to murder Sankararaman. Ravi Subramanian, a civil contractor who constructed buildings related to the Kanchi Mutt was alleged to have arranged Appu for the murder. Sundaresa Ayyar, the manager of the mutt for several years was added as an accused in the case as he was alleged to have arranged the funds for the murder from the Mutt accounts. A total of 24 people were accused in the case. Arrests alt=a seer in a seated posture The case involved the arrest of Jayendra Saraswati and Vijayendra Saraswati, the seers of the Kanchi Mutt, a monastic institution claimed to be established by Sri Adishankara. Jayendra was arrested on the Diwali day of 11 November 2004 at around 11:25 p.m. in Andhra Pradesh, while Vijayendra was arrested on the Mutt premises on 10 January 2005. Both the seers were in Mahabubnagar in Andhra Pradesh when the warrant was issued and the Tamil Nadu Police reached Hyderabad. Jayendrar was arrested and brought to Hyderabad airport from where he was brought to Chennai. 12 men including Jayendrar, were arrested in the case and five others surrendered in front of the George Town court. One of them confessed that he surrendered as 50,000 was paid to him for the surrender and the police arrested six men who arranged for the surrender. Appu was arrested on 11 November 2004 in Andhra Pradesh in connection with the case. Sundaresa Ayyar, the manager of the Kanchi Mutt was arrested in December 2004.Gupta 2006, p. 1227 Chargesheet The then Superintendent of Police K Premkumar who made the arrest and S P Sakthivelu, who was the investigating officer, submitted an 1875-page charge sheet before the Judicial Magistrate of Chingalpet. The charge sheet, filed on 21 January 2005, named 24 people accused in the case. There were separate charge sheets filed against Jayendrar and Vijayendrar who were the prime accused in the case. It named 377 witnesses in the case and provided 722 documents related to the case. The submission of charge sheet in the case enabled the trial to begin. Ravi Subramanian, who was a civil contractor and co-accused in the case turned an approver, and he was included as a prosecution witness. He mentioned that the arrest of Jayendrar was done based on the confession from Kathiravan, who was charged as accused number 6 in the case. Trial The bail plea of Jayendrar was declined in lower court and also in Madras High Court in December 2005.Gupta 2006, p. 1226 Jayendrar was released on bail on 10 January 2005, after two months of his arrest, by an order of the Supreme Court of India, which condemned the Tamil Nadu Police for not gathering credible evidence against the seer. The court also issued a notice to the Government of Tamil Nadu seeking explanation on detaining Krishnaswamy, one of the key accused in the case and not allowing him to be granted bail. The court also condemned the SP Premkumar for showing \\"undue interest and active participation\\" beyond his stated jurisdiction. Jayendrar was asked by the court not to visit the Mutt premises until the chargesheet was filed by the police. The Tamil Nadu government also filed a petition to the Supreme Court that the accused shall not reside in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Pondicherry during the course of investigation of the trial, but the petition was dismissed. Vijayendrar was released on bail by the Madras High Court on 11 February 2005, with a personal bond for 50,000 and two sureties. The trial was initially planned in Chengalpet court. But, the seers appealed in the Supreme Court of India against the conduct of trial in the state citing political reasons and doubting fair trial. Sankarraman's widow opposed it by quoting that the 375 witnesses were all from Tamil Nadu and the legal documents were all written in Tamil. On 27 March 2007, the court ordered the case to be shifted to the neighbouring Union Territory, Pondicherry. The trial began on 28 November 2007 in the principal sessions court in Pondicherry amidst tight security. Jayendrar also filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court on 22 July 2008, challenging the continuance of Public prosecutor appointed by the Tamil Nadu government in the Puducherry court. The court reserved its orders on transfer of the case to Puducherry on his petition in March 2007. The Supreme Court ordered the Puducherry government to appoint a public prosecutor in the case, following which, a senior lawyer, N Devadoss was appointed by the Puduchery government to handle the case. The case was the first of its kind in the legal history of Puducherry when a case was transferred to the Union Territory. Kathiravan, one of the 24 accused was murdered on 5 March 2013 by five gang men in his houses in KK Nagar in Chennai. A Trichy-based lottery businessman with whom Kathiravan was involved in a land grab issue, was allegedly found to be the reason of the murder. The trial involved examining 189 witnesses during the trial period of 2009 to 2013, out of which 89 turned hostile. The trial also saw four judges handling the case. On 27 November 2013, all the 24 accused were acquitted by the Puducherry Principal District Session, quoting lack of incriminating evidence against them. One among the 24, M Kathiravan, who was murdered on 24 March 2013, was also acquitted. The judge in his order, pronounced that the witnesses including the daughter of Sankararam failed to identify the accused in the court. The Puducherry court that pronounced the verdict on the trial noted that fair and proper trial was not performed in the case by the investigation officer due to the active involvement of SP Premkumar in the case beyond what is specified law. The court noted the same statements used by the Supreme Court against the SP when it granted bail to the seer during 2005. After opinion from Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi to the central Home ministry, the Puducherry government reversed its decision to file an appeal on the case. Political background J Jayalalithaa, the leader of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, was an ardent follower of the Shankarcharya and the Mutt. The last meeting between the seer and her had been reported on 11 August 2003, in the premises of the Mutt, when Sushil Kumar Shinde, the Maharashtra Chief Minister, was also paying a visit to the seer. The arrest of the Hindu seer in the case was seen as a political mileage for Jayalalithaa to improve her secular image to reach out to Muslim, Christian voters, with the Indian National Congress, who were otherwise part of the alliance of the opposing Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Another account claimed that Appu, one of the prime accused was working under Arcot N. Veeraswami, one of the leaders of the DMK. The seer's association with Appu, an opposition party member, is also believed to have effected in the fallout. Following the arrest of the seer, former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former president R. Venkataraman and leaders from different political parties held a protest in New Delhi condemning the arrest while the DMK party chief M. Karunanidhi welcomed the arrest. The then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh advised the state government to handle the case with care, considering the political tension surrounding it. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) organised a nationwide bandh to protest the arrest. Impact on Kanchi Mutt The Kanchi Mutt is seen as one of the prominent institutions of Hinduism and claims to have been established by Adi Sankara in 5th century BC. While the account of its origins is debated, the Mutt has been popular during the time of Chandrashekarendra Saraswati swamigal (20 May 1894 ‚Äì 8 January 1994). The Mutt was an element of criticism for the Dravidian parties in the state that follow Periyar's ideologies.Vaasanthi 2008, p. 17 It got national prominence with the involvement of Jayendrar in the Ayodhya issue. Following the arrest of the seer, all the 194 bank accounts of the Mutt were sealed as police believed that the murder was funded by these bank accounts. The Mutt operated temporarily out of Kalavai, following the release of Jayandrar on bail. The Madras High Court ruled against the Tamil Nadu Police on 11 January 2005, quoting \\"No one is above the law. But if you divert and deviate from that direction unmindful of the rights of innocent devotees of the Mutt, it would result not only in diluting the prosecution, but also cast a deep shadow on it. If there is anything wrong with the administration of the Mutt, it is for the H.R. & C.E. Department which has to comply with the procedure under the Act and to look after the said issues in terms of the provisions of the Act and it is not for the police to interfere with the functions of the Mutt while investigating a case of murder or assault.\\" NotesReferences * * Category:2004 crimes in India Category:Crime in Tamil Nadu Category:Kanchipuram district Category:2000s murders in India Category:2004 murders in Asia Category:Murder in India ","title":"Sankararaman murder case"},{"id":"41868350","title":"1916 United States presidential election in New Jersey"},{"id":"41868352","text":"Sportclub Buitenveldert are a Dutch amateur football (soccer) club from the Amsterdam borough of Amsterdam-Zuid in the neighborhood Buitenveldert, founded in 1974.

Obstacles include increasing pesticide resistance and an increasingly stringent regulatory environment. The sources of new molecules employ natural products, competitors, universities, chemical vendors, combinatorial chemistry libraries, intermediates from projects in other indications and compound collections from pharmaceutical and animal health companies.  History  Along with improved agrochemicals, seeds, fertilizers, mechanization, and precision farming, improved protection of crops from weeds, insects and other threats is highly sought. Developments over the past 1960-2013 period enabled reduced use rates, in the cases of the sulfonylurea herbicides (5), the piperidinylthiazole fungicides, and the mectin insecticides and acaricides, reaching 99%, with concomitant environmental improvements. The rate of new molecule introductions has declined. The costs to bring a new molecule to market have risen from U.S. $152 million in 1995 to $256 million in 2005, as the number of compounds synthesized to deliver one new market introduction rose from 52,500 in 1995 to 140,000 in 2005. New active ingredient registrations with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the 1997‚Äì2010 period included biological (B), natural product (NP), synthetic (S) and synthetic natural derived (SND) substances. Combining conventional pesticides and biopesticides, NPs accounted for the majority of registrations, with 35.7%, followed by S with 30.7%, B with 27.4% and SND with 6.1%.  Research process  Candidate molecules are optimized through a design-synthesis-test-analysis cycle. While compounds eventually are tested on the target organism(s). However, in vitro assays are becoming more common.  Parallels with pharmaceuticals  Agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals may operate via the same processes. In several cases, a homologous enzyme/receptor is addressed, and can potentially be of use in both contexts. One example is the triazole antimycotics or fungicides. However, the chemical environments encountered en route from the application site to the target generally require differing physicochemical properties, while the unit costs are generally much lower. Agrochemicals typically have a lower number of hydrogen bond donors. For example, over 70% of insecticides have no hydrogen bond donor, and over 90% of herbicides have two or fewer. Desirable agrochemicals have residual activity and persistence of effect lasting up to several weeks to allow large spray intervals. The majority of heterocycles found in agrochemicals are heteroaromatic.  Structure-based design  Structure-based design is a multidisciplinary process that is relatively new in agrochemicals. As of 2013 no products on the market were the direct result of this approach. However, discovery programs have benefited from structure- based design, including that for scytalone dehydratase inhibitors as rice blast fungicides. Structure-based design is appealing for crop researchers because of the many protein structures in the public domain, which increased from 13,600 to 92,700 between 200 and 2013. Many agrochemical crystals are now in the public domain. The structures of several interesting ion channels are now in the public domain. For example, the crystal structure of a glutamate- gated chloride channel in complex with ivermectin was reported in 2011 and represents a starting point for the design of novel insecticides. This structure led to a homology model for a related Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA)‚Äìgated chloride channel and a binding mode for the meta-diamides, another insecticide class.  Fragment- and target-based design  Techniques such as fragment-based design, virtual screening and genome sequencing have helped generate drug leads. Published examples of fragment-based agrochemical design have been comparatively rare, although the method was used to generate new ACC inhibitors. A combination of in silico fragment-based design with protein ligand crystal structures yielded synthetically amenable compounds. Common to all inhibitors is the methoxyacrylate \\"warhead\\", whose interactions and position are well known from the strobilurin fungicides. Fragments were linked to the warhead to form a virtual library. The likelihood of finding active analogs on the basis of a screen hit from a novel scaffold can be increased by virtual screening. Because the pharmacophore of the reference ligand is well defined, a virtual library of potential herbicidal inhibitors of the enzyme anthranilate synthase was generated by keeping the core scaffold constant and attaching different linkers. The scores obtained from docking studies ranked these molecules. Resulting novel compounds showed a primary hit rate of 10.9%, much higher than for conventional high-throughput screening. Other tools like three-dimensional (3D) shape, atom-type similarity, or 2D extended connectivity fingerprints also retrieve molecules of interest out of a database with a useful success rate. Scaffold-hopping is also efficiently achieved by virtual screening, with 2D and 3D variants providing the best results. Genome-sequencing, gene knockout or antisense knockdown techniques have provided agrochemists with a method for validating potential new biochemical targets. However, genes such as avirulence genes are not essential for the organism and many potential targets lack known inhibitors. Examples of this procedure include the search for new herbicidal compounds of the nonmevalonate, such as the discovery of new inhibitors of 2-C-methyl-D- erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (IspD, Enzyme Commission (EC) number 2.7.7.60) with the best expressing a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 140 nM in the greenhouse at . Thanks to an x-ray crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana, IspD enzyme cocrystallized with the inhibitor, a more potent inhibitor with an IC50 of 35 nM was designed. Mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) inhibitors were also found. Three hundred thousand compounds were tested against the SHMT enzyme, producing 24 hits. Among those hits, a subclass was followed with in vivo screening and compounds were promoted to field trials.  Plant activation  Plant activators are compounds that activate a plant's immune system in response to invasion by pathogens. They play a crucial role in crop survival. Unlike pesticides, plant activators are not pathogen specific and are not affected by drug resistance, making them ideal for use in agriculture. Wet- rice farmers across East Asia use plant activators as a sustainable means to enhance crop health. The activation of plant responses is often associated with arrested growth and reductions in yield, for reasons that remain unclear. The molecular mechanisms governing plant activators are largely unknown. Screening can distinguish compounds that independently induce immune responses from those that do so exclusively in the presence of some pathogen. Independent activators can be toxic to cells. Others enhance resistance only in the presence of pathogens. In 2012, five activators that protected against Pseudomonas bacteria by priming immune response without directly activating defense genes. The compounds inhibit two enzymes that inactivate the defense hormone salicylic acid (SA glucosyltransferases or SAGTs), providing enhanced disease resistance.

Her father was a newspaper publisher in that city, as were her grandfather Ebenezer Syme (proprietor of The Age), and William Spowers, the father of her friend and colleague, Ethel Spowers. Eveline Syme returned to England to study classics at Newnham College, Cambridge, but women were not granted degrees from Cambridge in her time, so she went back to Melbourne to earn an education degree.Stephen Coppel, \\"Syme, Eveline Winifred (1888‚Äì1961)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography(2002). Career Syme studied art in Paris and Melbourne, often in the company of Spowers.Felicity St. John Moore, \\"Eveline Syme, 'Tennis and Tea,'\\" in Lesley Harding and Sue Cramer, eds., Cubism and Australian Art(Miegunyah Press 2009): 107. She had her first solo show in Melbourne in 1925, and another in 1928, showing works in various media, many of them watercolor landscape studies, though she also painted in oils and drew in pencil. She and Spowers enrolled at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art in 1929, to learn more about linocuts.Stephen Coppel, Linocuts of the Machine Age: Claude Flight and the Grosvenor School (Scolar Press 1995). By the following year Syme was back in Melbourne, exhibiting and speaking about modern printmaking.Art Gallery NSW, \\"Works by Eveline Syme\\" Along with Spowers she was associated with George Bell's \\"Contemporary Art Group.\\" Late in life, she was on the executive committee of the National Gallery Society of Victoria.J ane Hyltton, Modern Australian Women: Paintings and Prints, 1925-1945 (Art Gallery of South Australia 2000). Syme was also involved in efforts during the 1930s to build a women's college at the University of Melbourne, and served as president of the University Women's College council in the 1940s.E. I. Lothian and Eveline Syme, University Women's College, University of Melbourne: A Brief History (University of Melbourne 1954). Syme died in 1961, age 72. She was buried at Brighton Cemetery.\\"Eveline Winifred Syme,\\" Brighton Cemetery Historic Interments, http://brightoncemetery.com/HistoricInterments/150Names/symee.htm She left much of her estate to the University Women's College.

With her signature silver hair and tight mermaid dresses, she became an early African-American sex symbol, garnering such nicknames as \\"The Bronze Blond Bombshell\\", \\"the black Marilyn Monroe\\", \\"The Belter\\" and \\"The Voice You'll Always Remember\\". Bryant left the industry in 1955 at the height of her popularity to devote herself to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. A decade later, she returned to show business as a trained classical vocalist and later became a vocal coach. Early life Joyce Bryant, the oldest of eight children, was born in Oakland, California, and raised in San Francisco. Her father, Whitfield W. Bryant (1904‚Äì1993), worked as a chef for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Her mother, Dorthy Constance Withers (maiden; 1907‚Äì1995), was a devout Seventh-day Adventist. Her maternal grandfather, Frank Withers (n√© Frank Douglas Withers; 1880‚Äì1952), was an early jazz trombonist. Bryant, a quiet child raised in a strict home, had ambitions of becoming a sociology teacher. She eloped at the age of 14 but the marriage ended that same evening. In 1946, while visiting cousins in Los Angeles, she agreed on a dare to participate in an impromptu singalong at a local club. \\"After a while,\\" Bryant recounted in a 1955 Jet interview, \\"I found I was the only one singing. A few minutes later the club owner offered me $25 to go up on stage, and I took it because I [needed the money] to get home.\\" Career Joyce Bryant, c. 1953. During the late 1940s, Bryant had slowly acquired a series of regular gigs, from a $400-per-week engagement at New York's La Martinique nightclub to a 118-show tour of the Catskill Mountains hotel circuit. Her reputation and profile eventually grew to the level that one night, she appeared on the same bill as Josephine Baker. Not wanting to be upstaged, Bryant colored her hair silver using radiator paint, and performed wearing a tight silver dress and silver floor-length mink. Bryant recalled when she arrived onstage, \\"I stopped everything!\\" Bryant's silver hair and tight, backless, cleavage-revealing mermaid dresses became her trademark look and, combined with her four octave voice, further elevated her status into one of the major headlining stars of the early 1950s, by which time she became known by such nicknames as \\"The Bronze Blond Bombshell\\", \\"the black Marilyn Monroe\\", \\"The Belter\\", and \\"The Voice You'll Always Remember\\". Etta James noted in her 2003 autobiography, Rage to Survive: The Etta James Story: \\"I didn't want to look innocent. I wanted to look like Joyce Bryant. [...] I dug her. I thought Joyce was gutsy and I copied her style-brazen and independent.\\" Beginning in 1952, Bryant released a series of records for Okeh, including \\"A Shoulder to Weep On\\", \\"After You've Gone\\" and \\"Farewell to Love\\". Two of her most well-known standards, \\"Love for Sale\\" and \\"Drunk with Love\\", were banned from radio play for their provocative lyrics. Upon the release of \\"Runnin' Wild\\" two years later, Jet noted that the song was Bryant's \\"first to be passed by CBS and NBC radio censors, who banned three previous recordings for being too sexy.\\" Bryant remarked in 1980, \\"what an irony that my biggest hit record was 'Love for Sale'. Banned in Boston it was, and later...just about everywhere else.\\" Bryant, who often faced discrimination and was outspoken on issues of racial inequality, became in 1952 the first black entertainer to perform at a Miami Beach hotel, defying threats by the Ku Klux Klan who had burned her in effigy. She was critical of racial billing practices at night clubs and hotels and advocated for entertainers as a group to fight Jim Crow laws. In 1954, she became one of the first black singers to perform at the Casino Royal in Washington, D.C., where she said that she had heard so much about the segregation practiced there that she was surprised to see so many African- Americans attend the downtown club. \\"It was a great thrill,\\" she said, \\"to see them enter and be treated so courteously by the management.\\" A Life magazine layout in 1953 depicted Bryant in provocative poses, which film historian and author Donald Bogle said were \\"the kind that readers seldom saw of white goddesses.\\" The following year, Bryant-along with Lena Horne, Hilda Simms, Eartha Kitt, and Dorothy Dandridge-was named in an issue of Ebony one of the five most beautiful black women in the world. Departure and return to show business Bryant earned up to $3500 a performance in the early 1950s, but she had grown weary of the industry. The silver paint had damaged her hair, she didn't enjoy working on the Sabbath, and she felt uneasy with her image. \\"Religion has always been a part of me,\\" she said. \\"and it was a very sinful thing I was doing being very sexy, with tight, low cut gowns.\\" She also recalled: \\"I had a very bad throat and I was doing eight performances a day [...] A doctor was brought in to help and he said, 'I can spray your throat with cocaine and that will fix the problem, but you'll become addicted.' Then I overheard my manager say, 'I don't care what you do, just make her sing!'\\" Further, Bryant hated the men, often gangsters, who frequented the clubs in which she worked. She was once beaten in her dressing room after rejecting a man's advances. Her disenchantment with the drug and gangster subcultures, combined with pressures from her management, led Bryant to quit performing late in 1955. Devoting herself to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Bryant enrolled in Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama. Ebony published a feature article in its May 1956 issue entitled \\"The New World of Joyce Bryant: Former Caf√© Singer Gives Up $200,000-a-year Career to Learn to Serve God\\". Traveling for years through the South, Bryant grew angry when she saw hospitals refuse care for those in critical need because they were black. As a result, she organized fundraisers for blacks to buy food, clothing, and medicine, and she continued to put on concerts wearing her natural black hair and no makeup to raise money for her church. She met frequently with Martin Luther King, Jr.-a fan of her singing-to support his efforts to bring basic material comforts to blacks. Bryant believed the struggle for civil rights to be the struggle for all people who believed in God, but when she confronted her church, asking it to take a stand against discrimination, the church refused with the reasoning, \\"But these are of earthly matters and thus of no spiritual importance.\\" Disillusioned, Bryant returned to entertaining in the 1960s and trained with vocal teacher Frederick Wilkerson at Howard University, which led to her winning a contract with the New York City Opera. She also toured internationally with the Italian, French, and Vienna Opera companies. She returned to performing jazz in the 1980s and began a career as a vocal instructor, with such clients as Jennifer Holliday, Phyllis Hyman, and Raquel Welch. A documentary, entitled Joyce Bryant: The Lost Diva, is in the works.

It was built in 1909 to house the bank, later known as Valley National Bank of Arizona, and it was listed on the Register in 1987. History The building served as the fourth branch of the Gila Valley Bank and Trust Building, which had been founded in Solomonville in 1900, and it was the first outside of Graham and Greenlee Counties. In 1922, Gila Valley Bank merged with Phoenix-based The Valley Bank and Trust to form what would become known as Valley National Bank of Arizona. Valley National Bank closed the branch in 1952,Building profile from the Globe Main Street Program and the building went through several different tenants, such as a news stand and other merchandise stores. As of 2017, it is in use as an art gallery. 2017 Flickr photo Architecture The building was designed by architects Ottenheimer, Stern & Reichert of Chicago.Economist 27 Feb. 1909: 410. It features the first known use of glazed terra cotta in Arizona as its exterior sheathing; the terra cotta was produced in Chicago. The presence of terra cotta exemplifies the economic prominence of Globe during the early 20th century as a mining and ranching center. Comparable facades were not in existence in Arizona until the late 1910s. The building is also the only Neoclassical structure in Globe, locally considered to be \\"outstanding\\". Among the architectural features of the building are Corinthian pilasters, an elaborate frieze, and several semicircular windows. Restoration work occurred in the 1980s, several years before the building was listed on the National Register. However, some alterations, such as the relocation of the entry to the corner of the building, the removal of decorative brickwork, and the addition of stucco, were preserved.

It was left unfinished at his death in 1806 and was not published until 1808. Background Ever since the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Whigs had appealed to that event as a great deliverance from the attempt by James II to set up an absolute monarchy. Fox (who was James' great- great-great nephew) was a staunch Whig and believed that his conflict with George III was similar to that between the Whigs of the late seventeenth century and James II. In August 1802, during the Peace of Amiens, Fox travelled to Paris to search the archives for his history. Talleyrand brought Fox into contact with the appropriate librarian and Fox would spend each day at the library.Mitchell, pp. 72-73. Part of Fox's motive in writing it was to correct the Tory interpretation of David Hume's History of England, who Fox considered to be \\"an excellent man and of great powers of mind, but his Partiality to Kings and Princes is intolerable\\".Mitchell, p. 189. Fox was able to glean information from what his grandfather the Duke of Richmond had heard from the Duchess of Portsmouth and he consulted fellow historians William Belsham, Sir John Dalrymple, Andrew Stuart, Charles Butler. Through his aristocratic connections, Fox was also able to access the papers of some of the British nobility and through his French connections he was able to enlist the help of Talleyrand and Lafayette to access French archives.Mitchell, pp. 189-190. Contents Fox originally wanted to carry the history down past James II's reign into that of William III but he died before he could complete it, and it was posthumously published in 1808. Fox's view is that of Whig history; that is, the history of England is an ongoing struggle between the absolutist designs of monarchs and the struggle of their subjects to assert their liberty.Mitchell, p. 191. Reception One of Fox's biographers claimed that the book \\"was cordially received by friends, criticized by others, ignored by professionals\\".Reid, p. 434. The Whig peer Lord Holland, who was Fox's nephew and who ensured its publication, considered it \\"an imperfect work but one which will if possible add to his reputation & I sometimes flatter myself infuse into posterity some little portion of that spirit of liberty which he & he alone preserved in this country for years\\".Mitchell, p. 189. Reviewing the book in the Edinburgh Review, Francis Jeffrey praised it as \\"the only appeal to the old principles of English constitutional freedom, and the only expression of those firm and temperate sentiments of independence, which are the peculiar produce, and natural protection of our mixed government, which we recollect to ave met with for very many years\\".Mitchell, p. 189. According to Lord John Russell the book was \\"a work which contains more sound constitutional opinions than any other history which I am acquainted\\".Mitchell, p. 189. The later Whig historian, Thomas Macaulay, wrote to his sister in 1833 that \\"We see in our time that the books written by public men of note are generally rated at more than their real value\\" and gave as an example Fox's history.George Otto Trevelyan, The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay. Volume I (Oxford University Press, 1978), p. 296. In reviewing Sir James Mackintosh's history of the Glorious Revolution in 1835, Macaulay claimed that \\"the superiority of Mr. Fox to Sir James as an orator is hardly more clear than the superiority of Sir James to Mr. Fox as a historian. Mr. Fox with a pen in his hand, and Sir James on his legs in the House of Commons were, we think, each out of his proper element\\".Thomas Babington Macaulay, Critical and Historical Essays: Volume One (London: J. M. Dent & Sons, 1935), p. 274. He added that Fox's work \\"will always keep its place in our libraries as a valuable book\\"Macaulay, p. 275. but that his obsessive desire not to use colloquial English was unworthy of so great a man. Macaulay also claimed that Fox's nature as an orator also hindered his ability as an historian: > There is about the whole book a vehement, contentious, replying manner. > Almost every argument is put in the form of an interrogation, an > ejaculation, or a sarcasm. The writer seems to be addressing himself to some > imaginary audience, to be tearing in pieces a defence of the Stuarts which > has just been pronounced by an imaginary Tory. Take, for example, his answer > to Hume's remarks on the execution of Sydney; and substitute ‚Äúthe honourable > gentleman‚Äù or ‚Äúthe noble Lord‚Äù for the name of Hume. The whole passage > sounds like a powerful reply, thundered at three in the morning from the > Opposition Bench. While we read it, we can almost fancy that we see and hear > the great English debater, such as he has been described to us by the few > who can still remember the Westminster scrutiny and the Oczakow > Negotiations, in the full paroxysm of inspiration, foaming, screaming, > choked by the rushing multitude of his words.Macaulay, p. 276. Charles Harding Firth considered the work to have \\"little historical value\\".Charles Harding Firth, A Commentary on Macaulay's History of England (London: Frank Cass, 1964), p. 57.

It was built in 1950 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History The building was constructed in 1950 for Valley National Bank of Arizona, the state's most prominent financial institution in the 20th century. It is located on a corner lot facing a major intersection in downtown Casa Grande, centrally located within the original town site. Valley National was one of the first banks in the state to open branches in its smaller communities. In 1934, the bank opened its first branch in town; this location was in use until 1991. The location of the building, at the intersection of Second Street and Florence, is also important to its history. In the 1940s, Casa Grande began to experience prosperity, further accelerating new, automobile-centric development not along Main Street and the railroad. The northern area of town developed such that by 1952, Second Street, not Main Street, represented the main highway through Casa Grande. Architecture The building is constructed of a steel frame with brick sheathing and is about in size. The building has a T-shaped layout, with an entry canopy that makes the building more rectangular in shape. The exterior also features accents of concrete and cast stone. Important features include the exterior canopy, windows and doors. The canopy is concrete with a brick support column, while the windows are large plate glass with aluminum frames, placed in several groupings. The building is highly horizontal; the canopy's inclusion as a soffit across the facade and the banks of windows help emphasize this design. In September 1960, the interior received a remodeling, with a replacement of the windows and doors with new, similar ones. A cast stone motif featuring a thunderbird was added to the canopies.

Background Uncle Sam reaching out for the isthmus of Panama. The direction of the film is credited to \\"P.P. Jambrina\\", which was a pseudonym used by Alfonso Mart√≠nez Velasco, who became mayor of Cali between September 1930 to September 1931. The film is a fierce critique of United States policy towards Latin America, focusing in particular on the United States' backing of Panamanian separatists that led to the partition of the former Isthmus Department from Colombia. The film's opening intertitle reads: \\"This film-novel is to protect from the oblivion of memory an important episode in modern history, which by fortune became the first stone in a landslide that tore apart our coat of arms and battered our eagles.\\" It is believed that all actors and staff involved in the film employed pseudonyms in order to avoid the fallout from what in 1926 was still a very polemical subject in Colombia. The film was censored by the Colombian government upon its release. It subsequently faded from the public view and was thought lost for decades. It was found and restored by the Fundaci√≥n Patrimonio F√≠lmico Colombiano, though only the film's beginning, end, as well as another three reels' worth of footage has been found.

The composition is considered one of Guthrie's best songs, defining his style, and demonstrating his \\"increasing comfort with writing topical songs about the poor and downtrodden\\". It has been categorized as a \\"Dust Bowl ballad\\" by music critics. The song was also included in the Library of Congress Recordings from 1940 made by Guthrie and Alan Lomax.Allmusic. [ Library Of Congress Recordings]. Retrieved on April 6, 2014. Music and lyrics The song was based on music used in Carson Robison's \\"Ballad of Billy the Kid\\" of the 1930s, which Guthrie slightly modified, adding new lyrics. It is written in a 3/4 time signature and has four-part harmony. The composition tells about the hard times that Americans experienced during the Great Depression, especially the \\"harsh weather and drought conditions\\" experienced by farm workers in the Western United States. Guthrie himself had lived in the town of Pampa, Texas, and had witnessed the devastating Black Sunday dust storm of April 14, 1935. The repetitive chorus has been described as \\"a witty, black retort, utterly negative and apocalyptic\\": \\"We talked of the end of the world, and then/We'd sing a song an' then sing it again/We'd sit for an hour an' not say a word/And then these words would be heard:/So long, it's been good to know yuh\\". Guthrie also wrote a version of the song with alternate lyrics about serving in the Second World War. Commercial success Although the song had a limited success during its 1930s release by Guthrie, its popularity soared in 1951 when it was recorded by The Weavers with different verses. The song peaked at number four on the pop music charts in 1951, and became known as one of the Weavers' \\"staple\\" tunes.  Cover versions  The song was occasionally used as a closing song on the variety show A Prairie Home Companion, usually with additional comical verses written by the host Garrison Keillor. The band X recorded a version on their 1988 album Live at the Whisky a Go Go on the Fabulous Sunset Strip. It was also a popular (often closing) number for Liverpool folk group The Spinners. Popular culture In the TV series M*A*S*H, in the episode \\"Mr. and Mrs. Who?\\" (Season 8, Episode 9, original airdate November 12, 1979), Hawkeye Pierce asks Father Mulcahy to play the song on the piano as they un-do a drunken wedding ceremony for Major Winchester. On the last day of his twenty-two years of hosting CBS Sunday Morning, Charles Osgood performed a cover of the song at the end of the show.

U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d. Web. 29 Apr. 2014. History Lysinibacillus fusiformis was initially isolated from the surface of beta vulgaris by German biologist Dr. O. Gottheil in 1901.\\"Botanische Beschreibung Einiger Bodenbakterien.\\" Internet Archive. Illinois, 1901. Web. 30 Apr. 2014. Dr. Gottheil used a variety of isolation techniques, which included cultivating the organism on carrot and beet slices. L. fusiformis was originally known as Bacillus fusiformis prior to 2007; at which point it was reclassified to the genus Lysinibacillus, along with its close relative Bacillus sphaericus.Ahmed, Iftikhar et al. \\"Proposal of Lysinibacillus Boronitolerans Gen. Nov. Sp. Nov., and Transfer of Bacillus Fusiformis to Lysinibacillus Fusiformis Comb. Nov. and Bacillus Sphaericus to Lysinibacillus Sphaericus Comb. Nov.\\" IJSEM. International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, May 2007. Web. 29 Apr. 2014. The taxonomic classification of the organism was reassigned as a result of L. fusiformis' distinctive characteristics, such as physiology, phylogeny, and peptidoglycan composition. Etymology The meaning of \\"lysini,\\" as it pertains to members of the genus Lysinibacillus, signifies the presence of lysine, alanine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid in the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. ‚ÄúBacillus‚Äù, meaning small-rod, refers to the rod-shaped physiology of the bacterial form. ‚ÄúFusum‚Äù translates to spindle and ‚Äúforma‚Äù denotes a particular figure, appearance, or configuration. Thus, ‚Äúfusiformis‚Äù is derived from the bacteria‚Äôs spindle-like structure. Morphology Lysinibacillus fusiformis is gram-positive, rod-shaped, non-motile bacterium.David Hendricks, Paul De Vos, and William Barny Whitman. The Firmicutes. 2nd ed. Vol. 3. Dordrecht: Springer, 2009. Print.

Under strenuous conditions, this microbe can generate inactive spherical endospores that are resistant to high temperatures, damaging chemicals, and ultraviolet light. The developing endospores localize either centrally or terminally within the enlarged sporangia and can remain functional for long periods of time. Ecology Lysinibacillus fusiformis is a naturally occurring bacterium and various strains have been isolated from multiple environments including farming soil and factory wastewater. This organism is considered to be altogether mesophilic; growing best at a temperature range of 17-37 degrees Celsius. L. fusiformis is also considered to be mildly alkaliphilic and moderately halophilic; growing best at a pH range of 6-9.5 and an NaCl concentration of 2-7%. Pathogenicity In the 20th Century, Lysinibacillus fusiformis was believed to cause a form of pathogenicity in humans relating to tropical ulcer formations and dermal and/or respiratory infections. Some researchers believed that L. fusiformis infections could only occur as a symbiotic relationship with certain spirochaete species. Multiple experiments to prove the existence of pathogenicity have turned up inconclusive In 2010, researchers identified a strain of L. fusiformis, B-1, from 16S rRNA gene analysis.Wang, Jun, Yanhui Fan, and Zhigang Yao. \\"Isolation of a Lysinibacillus Fusiformis Strain with Tetrodotoxin-producing Ability from Puffer Fish Fugu Obscurus and the Characterization of This Strain.\\" ScienceDirect. Elservier, 15 Sept. 2010. Web. 29 Apr. 2014. This strain has been found exclusively in the toxin of the puffer fish, Takifugu obscurus. This toxin is a tetrodotoxin, which is a highly fatal neurotoxin that destroys the central nervous system of humans causing paralysis. L. fusiformis is shown to be sensitive to the common broad-spectrum antibiotic known as tetracycline. Metabolism Lysinibacillus fusiformis tests positive for oxidase and is an obligate aerobe. This means that it can utilize oxygen to metabolize various sugars and other simple carbohydrates. However, it does not metabolize polysaccharides such as starch. This organism does not produce acid or gas from the metabolism of D-glucose or any other carbohydrates and does not reduce nitrate to nitrite. L. fusiformis can hydrolyze casein and gelatin. It can also utilize acetate, citrate, formate, lactate, and succinate as carbon sources. From a metabolic standpoint, L. fusiformis and Lysinibacillus sphaericus are nearly identical. As of now, the only known factor that distinguishes these two species is that L. fusiformis is positive for urease. This means that L. fusiformis can hydrolyze urea to produce ammonia and CO2.Brink, Benita. \\"Urease Test Protocol.\\" ASM MicrobeLibrary. American Society For Microbiology, 11 Nov. 2011. Web. 29 Apr. 2014. In 2011, the strain L. fusiformis ZC1 was shown to retain the ability to reduce chromate to chromium. Genomics As of 2014, there are a couple partial 16S rRNA gene sequences (GenBank No. AF169537 and EU430993) that have been analyzed for L. fusiformis and several whole genome sequences of various strains.Nakamura, L. K. \\"Phylogeny of Bacillus Sphaericus-Like Organisms.\\" International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 50 (2000): 1715-722. Web. There are multiple ongoing genome sequencing projects involving this organism. Currently, these genomic sequences exist as scaffolds and include the following strains: Lysinibacillus fusiformis H1K, Lysinibacillus fusiformis ZB2, and Lysinibacillus fusiformis ZC1. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, L. fusiformis ZC1 (BioProject: PRJNA226204) is the current genomic representative for L. fusiformis. The L. fusiformis ZC1 genome was sequenced using the whole genome shotgun sequencing method. Genomic analysis of strain ZC1 shows a genome with an approximate length of 4.65 megabases that contains 4,729 protein-coding genes and maintains a relatively moderate GC content (mol%) of 37.3%. The gene chrA was found in L. fusiformis and encodes a chromate Cr(VI) transporter that confirms chromate Cr(VI) resistance. Applications to science and medicine The mechanism of L. fusiformis‚Äô pathogenicity is not well understood by microbiologists. Plastic Degradation: In 2016, a group of researchers lead by Prof. A. B. Ade at the Department of Botany, Savitribai Phule University, Pune, MS, India reported 22% reduction in weight loss of the plastic (polythene) with Lysinibacillus fusiformis strain VASB14/WL after 2 months of regular shaking at room temperature .

Her father Sang-gu, a taxi driver in Gangwon Province, is proud and overjoyed when Yoon-mi gets hired as a factory worker at the Jinsung semiconductor factory. But just two years later he learns that his daughter has been diagnosed with leukemia; four years after her diagnosis, Yoon-mi dies in the backseat of Sang-gu's cab.

He makes a visit to a labor attorney to file a claim against the most powerful conglomerate in the country. Sang-gu and his family, along with their attorney and other families of leukemia patients, are soon shaken up as the company uses different methods of appeasement and pressure to keep the families from uniting, among them offering money to keep the issue from becoming public. Jinsung workers also spy on the families of the plaintiffs, stalk them and threaten them, all for the sake of their company, which they genuinely believe to be in the right.

His daughter Hwang Yu-mi was diagnosed with an advanced stage of leukemia two years after working at a Samsung semiconductor factory; she died in 2007 at age 23, four years after her initial hiring. Samsung's official stance was that there was no causal relationship between Hwang's employment with them and her sickness. Company sources pointed out that the incidence of hematological cancers, such as leukemia, in the semiconductor industry, was lower than the national average for South Korea. They also cite that independent research, including a three-year review by the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, and a study by the US consulting firm Environ International, had found no correlation between the workplace environment and employee illness. According to the Supporters for the Health and Rights of People in the Semiconductor Industry (SHARPS), however, the rare form of leukemia that afflicted Hwang Yu- mi is found in only 4.2 in every 100,000 South Koreans aged between 20 and 29. Hwang Sang-ki said that Samsung offered him a settlement in exchange for dropping the compensation claim, but he rejected the offer. \\"After I turned down an offer of one million dollars, they basically asked me to name my price,\\" he said. \\"But there was no way I could take their money, not when I knew that other families were suffering.\\" Hwang filed his lawsuit with The Korea Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service (KCOMWEL), a government agency that compensates workers and levies companies to fund the payouts. KCOMWEL found Samsung innocent, stating that there was no evidence to suggest that Hwang Yu-mi died from a work-related illness. There was little media attention on the case until 2011, when the Seoul administrative court overturned the KCOMWEL verdict, ruling that toxic chemicals at Samsung plants \\"had caused, or at least expedited\\" cases of cancer in two workers, Hwang Yu-mi included. The ruling was the first case in which an individual won a suit against a Korean conglomerate. KCOMWEL has currently filed an appeal. Since Hwang's victory, other victims and their families have begun filing similar suits. About 200 workers have made similar allegations against Samsung and other memory chipmakers, according to SHARPS. Lee Jong-ran, an industrial health rights activist and lawyer, said that from 2008 to 2013, 39 Samsung Electronics employees have filed compensation claims with the KCOMWEL for job-related illness; three were successful, 15 are still under review by the agency and 21 were rejected. Most of the semiconductor industry workers who turned to SHARPS were in their 20s and 30s when they fell ill. As of February 2014, more than 50 have since died. Samsung has not officially commented on the movie, but Kim Sun-beom, spokesman of Samsung's device solutions department, posted an online rebuttal on the company's official blog Samsung Tomorrow, saying that the movie was an \\"unfair depiction\\" and \\"oversimplification\\" of the situation, and raised concerns that the company's image was being demonized. However, with the effect of the movie, Samsung admitted on May 14, 2014 for the allegations that made former employees fallen ill after working for the company, promising compensation to sufferers of leukemia and other ailments. Samsung had agreed to set up an independent mediation committee to look at the cases of workers who have fallen ill and agree compensation. Samsung also promised an evaluation of working conditions in its factories.Samsung says sorry and promises compensation to sick workers, CNET News, May 14, 2014 The company did not follow all recommendations of the mediation committee, however, and instead installed a \\"Compensation Committee\\" on its own. Shortly afterward it was reported that Samsung had paid out some victims outside of the scheme with so-called 'hush' money, which includes no admitting of wrongdoing and the condition to drop all further claims. This prompted SHARPS to ask the public for help by publishing a letter urging Samsung to implement the mediation committee's recommendations. The letter was signed by more than 10,000 people. On October 7, 2015 a sit-in was started in front of Samsung's headquarters in Seoul. Since then Samsung has not resumed talks with SHARPS or the other victim's families. Release Another Promise premiered in the Panorama section of the 18th Busan International Film Festival in October 2013, then received a theatrical release on February 6, 2014.

It is located in the village of Leikanger, along the northern coast of the Sognefjorden. It is the church for the Leikanger parish which is part of the Sogn prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, stone church has a large wooden steeple. The building was constructed in a long church style around the year 1250 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 220 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1308, but the building was likely built around the year 1250. It may be the second church on the site, with an earlier church possibly dating back to the 1100s. Parts of the building have been renovated and rebuilt over the centuries. In the 1600s, the chancel was reconstructed and the old tower was torn down and rebuilt in a neo-gothic style. In 1872, the church was heavily renovated by the architect Christian Christie. During this reconstruction, the entire choir being torn down and rebuilt and a new tower was built. The redesigned church was consecrated on 14 November 1872 by Bishop Peter Hersleb Graah Birkeland after the extensive reconstruction. In the 1930s through the 1950s, the church was again renovated, this time under the direction of the architect Johan Lindstr√∏m.

The Clemente, which was established as a cultural center in 1993, is located on 107 Suffolk Street in the former PS 160 in Manhattan's historic Lower East Side neighborhood (known as Loisaida by locals). In addition to hosting programming related to Peforma and IDEAS City, the Center is also home to Teatro La Tea, LEFT (Latino Experimental Fantastic Theater), and the leading children‚Äôs company SEA, believed to be the only bilingual puppet theatre in the United States. The organization is based in a 1897 City owned building formerly known as P.S. 160, and designed by the architect Charles B. J. Snyder in the collegiate neo-gothic style. It is a representative example of the large number of school buildings that were erected in New York City in the late nineteenth century. In the 1970s a fire caused the school to be vacated and it remained so until 1981, when Solidaridad Humana, a community based educational organization, began to use the building as a school for Spanish-speaking immigrants. Since 1993 the administration of The Clemente has been managing a growing program of long term studios for artists, available at a subsidized license fee. The Clemente has developed an on-going performing arts and exhibition programming, and houses 4 theaters, 3 exhibition galleries, 46 subsidized artists studios, and 12 subsidized offices for arts and education non-for-profit organizations. http://www.theclementecenter.org/history-building/ In December 2019, urban anthropologist, scholar, curator and cultural organizer/producer, Libertad O. Guerra, previously Director and Chief Curator of the Loisaida Cultural Center, was selected as Executive Director of the Clemente Soto V√©lez Cultural and Educational Center.  Building: Charles B. J. Snyder  The Clemente Soto V√©lez Cultural and Educational Center is the foremost architectural landmark in that part of the Lower East Side still known as Loisaida. The Dutch Neo- Gothic building was designed as a public school by Charles B. J. Snyder. He is widely recognized for his transformation of school building design and quality during his tenure as Superintendent of School Buildings of the New York City Board of Education between 1891 and 1923. The Clemente Soto V√©lez Cultural & Educational Center is the foremost architectural landmark in that part of the Lower East Side. Snyder perceived school buildings as civic monuments that would better society and sought to provide spaces for learning that would offer a respite from noisy streets and poverty. He was an inventive designer who at his best created school buildings that were appropriately imposing in their neighborhood settings, and that also, in both their massing and their ornamentation, showed a light-handedness that kept the structures from feeling oppressive. He was concerned with health and safety issues in public schools and focused on fire protection, ventilation, lighting, and classroom size. Snyder used terra cotta blocks in floor construction to improve fireproofing, and large and numerous windows to allow more light and air into the classrooms. The subject building, located on a corner lot, is L-shaped in configuration and five stories in height. A dramatic steeply pitched roof line punctuated by dormers defines the street facades. The building has a rich variety of ornamental details in terra cotta, limestone and brick. At the time the project commenced, many of the original wood windows remained while others had been replaced with less ornate wood or aluminum frames. An iron fence surrounds the facility at the street facades and there are five entrance vestibules with wrought iron gates, bluestone steps and mosaic tile floors. After over a century of service without substantial rehabilitation, the building was in very poor condition when Superstructures began an investigation of the exterior in 2006. By that point there had been a sidewalk shed in place for eight years due to the deteriorated condition of the fa√ßade. Interviews done as part of a master planning study conducted by The Clemente during this period confirmed a deep respect and admiration for the architecture of the building‚Äôs exterior. However, there was a vital interest in improving the safety of the building and in providing a more welcoming entrance. The complete exterior restoration completed in 2012 under the direction of Superstructures Engineers + Architects included roof replacement and repair, replacement of bulkheads and copper gutters, replacement and/or repair of brick masonry, restoration or replacement of terra cotta, replacement and/or restoration of windows, cleaning of limestone and terrazzo. The NYC Department of Cultural Affairs and NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services funded the project, which was managed by the NYC Department of Design and Construction. In 2013 the exterior restoration project was recognized by the New York Landmarks Conservancy with its prestigious Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award.  History: from PS 160 to Clemente Soto V√©lez Cultural Center and Educational Center  The building served as PS 160 until the mid-seventies. In 1984 it became the home of Solidaridad Humana, a community-based bilingual education program. In 1993, Edgardo Vega Yunqu√©, Nelson Landrieu and Mateo G√≥mez, all of whom are actively involved in the Latinx arts community of New York City, founded the Clemente Soto V√©lez as a cultural and educational center. At the time, Teatro La Tea, established by Landrieu and G√≥mez, was already based at 107 Suffolk Street. Less than a year later, the trio acquired the lease to the building from Solidaridad Humana. The Clemente Soto V√©lez is a Puerto Rican/Latinx cultural institution that has demonstrated a broad-minded cultural vision and a collaborative philosophy. Clemente Soto V√©lez, a poet, journalist and activist, mentored many generations of Latinx artists in Puerto Rico and in New York City. The organization‚Äôs mission is to foster, promote, and support the development of the arts within the community and to increase appreciation of Puerto Rican-Latinx arts in the city and beyond. The Clemente currently provides studio space for over two dozen artists, as well as a home for the following institutions: * Hispanic Organization for Latin Actors (HOLA), committed to exploring and expanding available avenues for projecting Hispanic artists into the mainstream. * Afro Brazil Arts / Capoeira Angola Quintal, whose mission is to inspire achievement through capoeira, a Brazilian martial art that incorporates music and dancing. * Fantastic Experimental Latino Theater (FELT), offering interactive theater and educational programs. * Mark DeGarmo & Dancers/Dynamic Forms Inc, providing a comprehensive arts experience to students from economically disadvantaged circumstances. *The Society of the Educational Arts, Inc. (SEA), a bilingual arts-in-education organization & Latinx theatre company for young audiences. * Teatro LaTea, one of New York‚Äôs premier Off-Off-Broadway Latinx theaters.

He was expelled from the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1916 for conduct unbecoming a member of the General Court after he collected money from people interested in pending legislation. Early life Foster was born on August 27, 1871, in Swampscott, Massachusetts. He graduated from Gloucester High School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked as a civil engineer and was employed for a time by the Boston Elevated Railway Company. Political career From 1898 to 1901, Foster was chairman of the Gloucester Republican City Committee. He was a member of the party's state committee from 1900 to 1901. Foster was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1898. From 1902 to 1903 he was a member of the Massachusetts Senate. He represented the 3rd Essex District, which consisted of Essex, Gloucester, Hamilton, Ipswich, Manchester, Newbury, Newburyport, Rockport, Rowley, and Wenham. During his second term a Senate committee found Foster guilty of indiscreet, imprudent, and injurious conduct, but no action was taken. He then served as Mayor of Gloucester from 1912 to 1915. In 1915, Foster returned to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Expulsion On March 1, 1916, State Representative James M. Lyle appeared before the Legislative Committee on Roads and Bridges and accused Foster of collecting money to be used for lobbying a bill compelling the city of Gloucester and the town of Rockport to contribute about $90,000 towards the construction of a new highway through the legislature. Lyle reiterated his accusation at a session later that afternoon and added that he wanted the matter investigated and that he would present evidence at the proper time. Foster admitted to collecting money, but claimed that it was used to employ counsel on behalf of the bill. On March 3, the House voted in favor of two similar resolutions introduced by Lyle and Foster asking for an investigation of Foster by the Rules Committee. On March 16, the Rules Committee recommended to the House that Foster be expelled. In its report to the House, the committee wrote that \\"by collecting money from persons he knew interested in legislation before said General Court... in the manner and under the circumstances set forth in evidence... is guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the General Court and guilty of such conduct that it demands his expulstion from said body as a member.\\" On March 17, the House voted in favor of expelling Foster by a voice vote. Foster would be the last member of the Massachusetts House to be expelled until Carlos Henriquez's expulsion on February 6, 2014. Death Foster died on March 5, 1917, in Seward, Alaska, of apoplexy. His body was sent to Gloucester, where it arrived on March 22. The funeral was held on March 25 at the Magnolia Congressional Church.

The small convergence zone forms within specific weather conditions sometimes found in the wake of extratropical cyclones shifting east of the area. Given air pressure decreasing with both longitude and latitude, as well as weak synoptic low-level flow, winds are channeled east along the Mohawk Valley and south through the Hudson Valley, converging over Albany. With sufficient moisture in the lower atmosphere, a localized area of precipitation may form where the valleys meet, extending for several miles around Albany. The process manifests primarily in the lowest of the atmosphere. MHC-induced precipitation occurs predominately in the winter. It typically produces low clouds and light snowfall, often locally prolonging significant snow events by several hours. The strongest MHC events may yield snowfall rates approaching 1 in (2.5 cm) per hour. Occasionally, MHC contributes to shower and thunderstorm formation in the warm season. In early August 2008, two days of training thunderstorms over the Capital District were attributed to MHC; the result was locally heavy rain, amounting to over . A relatively rare variation of MHC, termed \\"Southern Mohawk‚ÄìHudson convergence\\" (SMHC), occurs in the summer, when a southwesterly wind is present in advance of an approaching cold front. In that scenario, the Hudson and Mohawk valleys may direct the flow to become more southerly and westerly, respectively, yielding the formation of thunderstorms around Albany when conditions permit. As with MHC, SMHC is most pronounced in the absence of mechanisms for strong synoptic ascent over the region. Whereas the effects of the convergence zone are generally insignificant in the winter, SMHC presents more of a forecasting challenge when thunderstorms rapidly develop threaten and to impede travel at Albany International Airport. Thunderstorms associated with SMHC have the potential to become severe.

The wind farm was refused planning permission in September 2015. History and development Eneco Energie was awarded seabed land rights to develop a Round 3 offshore wind farm by The Crown Estate in 2010. Initial estimates were that around 30% of the zone could be used for wind farm development, giving a capacity of ~900 MW. An initial \\"Zone Appraisal and Planning\\" (ZAP) report was published in December 2010.

History  The organization was originally known as the American Friends of the Anne Frank Center, and later the Anne Frank Center USA. Updated for clarification on June 29, 2017. According to the Center, it originated as an affiliate of the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. Both the House and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel, Switzerland are among the Anne Frank Center's worldwide organizational partners. It said on its website that it was founded in 1959 with Anne's father Otto Frank as one of its founders. That was disputed by The Atlantic, which reported in an April 2017 profile of the group that past staffers and documentation indicate it was actually started in 1977, with no involvement by Otto Frank. After the Atlantic article appeared, the organization provided a document from 1959 which shows that Otto Frank gave permission to use of his name in fundraising literature for the Anne Frank Foundation Inc. in the United States and Amsterdam, and that he was listed as president of the Foundation. From 2011 to 2016 the center had a small public gallery in lower Manhattan. In 2016, the board of directors brought in Steven Goldstein as executive director, changed the name to add \\"mutual respect,\\" and broadened its mission to include an emphasis on ‚Äúexposing and fighting hate.‚Äù It is described by its chairman Peter Rapaport as neither a Jewish nor a Holocaust organization. While it speaks out against antisemitism, it also criticizes what it sees as sexism, racism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and other issues. It is headquartered in New York City and its former executive director was political activist Steven Goldstein, known for his advocacy of LGBT rights as founder of Garden State Equality. The center received significant press attention in early 2017 due to its criticism of the Trump administration. Following the presidential 2016 election, Liel Leibovitz writing in The Tablet, described it as \\"one of the loudest voices in the #resistance to Trump.\\"  Criticism of the Trump Administration  In 2016 and 2017 the organization was vocally critical of the Donald Trump Administration, claiming it has failed to counter anti-Semitism and for his policies concerning refugees and immigrants. In February 2017, after the administration condemned threats against Jewish institutions, Goldstein called Trump's \\"sudden acknowledgment\\" of anti-Semitism \\" a \\"Band-Aid on the cancer of anti- Semitism that has infected his own administration.\\" Goldstein called for Sean Spicer's resignation after his comment that, unlike Bashar al-Assad, \\"Hitler didn't even sink to the level of using chemical weapons.\\" He called for Sebastian Gorka's resignation in response to allegations that the Order of Vit√©z, of which Gorka is a member, is an anti-Semitic, Hungarian ultranationalist group. The Atlantic and the daily online Jewish news site Tablet Magazine criticized the center for politicizing Anne Frank's legacy in its criticism of the Donald Trump administration. The magazines said that the media has paid undue attention to the Center because of its use of Anne Frank's name, and The Atlantic said that by \\"politicizing Anne Frank\\" it may undermine her legacy. Abraham Foxman, former head of the Anti-Defamation League, told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that he believed Frank's name was abused and that \\"every time I read that he [Goldstein] says something under her banner, I feel uncomfortable.‚Äù Foxman was himself a hidden child during the Holocaust. In a Washington Post profile, Goldstein rejected accusations that he is politicizing Anne Frank and called her ‚Äúone of the greatest feminist and social justice leaders in history.‚Äù Goldstein resigned from the center in September 2017.

Life Vu√ßit√´rni was born in Vƒ±√ßƒ±tƒ±rƒ±n, Vilayet of Kosovo, Ottoman Empire on 8 April 1880. He descended from a landowning family. Initially he served as town's hodja. In 1920 he moved to Albania and served as vice-prefect of Tirana. From 1921 to 1925 he served as Assemblyman of the Albanian Parliament representing the region of Dibra. From 1925 to 1928 he was a member of the Senate. In February 1927, following the review that showed disorder and confusion at the Albanian vakf where he was an administrator, and the failure of the reform on the medreses, Vu√ßit√´rni called for a reform on the charity institutions. The call led to controversies. From May 1928 to 1930 he served as Minister of Public Works () in the government of Kostaq Kota. During the term he was investigated for corruption. From 1928 to 1932 he was elected again in the Albanian Parliament. He was one of the two trusted men of Ahmet Zogu for reviving the Committee of Kosovo together with Ismet Bey Kryeziu of Gjakova. Once Zogu's strong opponents as Bajram Curri and Hasan Prishtina were gone and Albania was leaning towards Italy, King Zog decided to revive and finance the organization keeping connections with few pro-Zog irredentists within Kosovo. Nevertheless, the activity of the Committee of Kosovo at that time would be mainly propagandistic. Vu√ßit√´rni was elected as head of a governmental committee responsible for an Agrarian Reform in Albania, a committee which practically did not accomplish anything important beside assisting Kosovar families which were abandoning Kosovo to settle in agrarian areas of central Albania. In 1939 he was elected by the Italians as Director of SITA, and Italian company responsible for electrical energy and logistics, replacing Qemal Vrioni. In 1942 Vu√ßit√´rni would serve as manager of the properties of the Muslim Community in Albania. He would be arrested by the Albanian communists in late 1944 and sentenced as war criminal and collaborationist.

She has won many prestigious awards in the field, including the James B. Macelwane Medal of the American Geophysical Union. Her book Lab Girl (2016) has been applauded as both \\"a personal memoir and a paean to the natural world\\", a literary fusion of memoir and science writing, and \\"a compellingly earthy narrative.\\"  Early life and education  Jahren was born in Austin, Minnesota on September 27, 1969. Her father taught science at a community college and she has three older brothers. She completed her undergraduate education in geology at the University of Minnesota, graduating cum laude in 1991.  Career and research  Jahren earned her Ph.D in 1996 at the University of California, Berkeley in the field of soil science. Her dissertation covered the formation of biominerals in plants and used novel stable isotope methods to examine the processes. From 1996 to 1999, she was an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, then moved to Johns Hopkins University, where she stayed until 2008. At Georgia Tech, she conducted pioneering research on paleoatmospheres using fossilized plants, and discovered the second methane hydrate release event that occurred 117 million years ago. She also spent a year on a Fulbright Award at the University of Copenhagen, learning DNA analysis techniques. While at Johns Hopkins, Jahren received media attention for her work with the fossil forests of Axel Heiberg Island. Her studies of the trees allowed her to estimate the environmental conditions on the island 45 million years ago. She and her collaborators analyzed depletion of oxygen isotopes to determine the weather patterns there that allowed large Metasequoia forests to flourish during the Eocene. Her research at Johns Hopkins also included the first extraction and analysis of DNA found in paleosol and the first discovery of stable isotopes existing in a multicellular organism's DNA. Jahren left Johns Hopkins for a full professorship at the University of Hawaii. Her research there focused on using stable isotope analysis to determine characteristics of the environment on different timescales. On September 1, 2016, Jahren became the J. Tuzo Wilson Professor at the University of Oslo's Centre for Earth Evolution and Dynamics, where she studies how living and fossil organisms are chemically linked to the environment.  Honors and awards  Jahren has received three Fulbright Awards: in 1992 for geology work conducted in Norway, in 2003 for environmental science work conducted in Denmark, and in 2010 for arctic science work conducted in Norway. In 2001, Jahren won the Donath Medal, awarded by the Geological Society of America. In 2005, she was awarded the Macelwane Medal, becoming the first woman and fourth scientist overall to win both the Macelwane Medal and the Donath Medal. Jahren was profiled by Popular Science magazine in 2006 as one of its \\"Brilliant 10\\" scientists. She was a 2013 Leopold Fellow at Stanford University's Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. In 2016, Time Magazine named her one of the world's \\"100 Most Influential People.\\" Jahren was awarded Australian Society for Medical Research Medal for 2018. She was also elected to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 2018.  Support for science awareness  Jahren is an advocate for raising public awareness of science and has been working to lift the stereotype surrounding women and girls in science. One such example included the repurposing of the Twitter hashtag #ManicureMondays. Seventeen magazine originally came up with the hashtag, but focused mainly on manicured and painted fingernails. Subsequently, Jahren encouraged fellow scientists, specifically girls, to tweet pictures of their hands conducting scientific experiments. The idea behind this was to raise awareness of scientific research and to increase the profile of women working in science. Jahren has also written compellingly about the sexual harassment of women in science. She recommends that people draw strong professional boundaries, and that they carefully document what occurs, beginning with the first occasion of harassment.

The reforms started in 1901 and since they were implemented with the backing of the Empress Dowager Cixi, they are also called Cixi's New Policies.  Politics  In April 1901, the Qing dynasty established the Administration Office to supervise the overall plan for reform, appointing Ronglu, Qing Prince and Li Hongzhang as managers, nominating Zhang Zhidong and Liu Kunyi as coordinators. Zhang Zhidong and Liu Kunyi jointly submitted \\"Three folds for reform\\" to the imperial government, which includes setting reform direction, learning from Japan and implementing the constitutional monarchy.  Five ministers went abroad to investigate  On January 19, 1904, viceroy of Yun-Gui Ding Zhenduo and Yunnan provincial Patrol Lin Shaonian submitted the application for political reform to the imperial government. At the beginning of the July, Viceroy of Liangjiang Zhou Wei ask for the implementation of the \\"separation of the three powers\\" political system. On July 2, 1905, Yuan Shikai joining with Zhou Wei and viceroy of Huguang Zhang Zhidong required imperial government to implement constitutional government in a twelve-year period. They also asked the government to assign ministers to go abroad to investigate various political formats. On September 24, 1905, the Empress Dowager Cixi decided to assign five ministers: Zhen Prince Zaize, Financial Minister Dai Hongci, Military Minister Xu Shichang, Governor of Hunan Duanfang and Prime Minister of Business Department Shaoying to go abroad. On November 25, the imperial government set up a special institution \\"Inspection of the political pavilion\\" to study the constitutional government of each country, and provide consultation on constitutional reform. In the same year, on December 7, the first group leading by Dai Hongci and Duanfang set off at the first stop, the United States, and was met by the US President Theodore Roosevelt. On January 14, 1906, the second group leading by Zaize set out. At the end of the summer, 1906, the delegation returned to China and submitted a report arguing that ‚ÄúThe only way for state to be powerful is constitutionalism‚Äù. On September 1, 1906, the Empress Dowager Cixi promulgated an imperial decree, announcing preparatory imitation of constitution. In 1907, the preparatory office of the Zizhengyuan Institute (Parliament) was established, and Ming Lun and Sun Jiaxuan were appointed as the presidents of the Zizhengyuan Institute. Later, Zhang Jiang and Tang Shouqian established a preparatory constitutional guild in Shanghai. After that, various constitutional guilds were established in major cities all around China. In August 1908, the imperial government published \\"Constitutional Outline\\", \\"The list of Preparations in next few years\\", and three appendices including \\"Civil Rights and Obligations\\", \\"The essentials of Parliament\\", \\"Election Law Essentials\\". These proposed law regulated that provincial advisory council and Central Advisory Council would be elected in the next year and the constitution was plan to prepared in nine years. On November 15, the Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu died. In 1909, after Pu Yi, the last emperor of Qing Dynasty succeeded to the throne, the provincial advisory councils were elected. In 1910, the Zizheng Institute held its first opening ceremony. In May 1911, the prince regent Zaifeng appointed Qing Prince as the Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet to organize the new cabinet. The head of the new cabinet has 13 members, including eight Manchurians, four Han Chinese, one Mongolian. As there was seven Manchurians belonging to royal family, the cabinet was taunted as \\"royal cabinet\\".  Local administrative reform  In 1902, Shanxi governor Zhao Erxun proposed to reform the local administrative reforms such as the Baojia system, including the establishment of the modern police system and the expansion of local organizational functions. In 1907, the local official system was promulgated, and the financial power and military power of the governor were reduced. The Ministry of Civil Affairs owned the function of the national patrol.  Local autonomy reform measures  In 1906, Yuan Shikai had already established the local ‚ÄúAutonomous Research Institute‚Äù and the Tianjin County Council in Tianjin. In 1908, the imperial government also began to set up autonomous research institutes in the urban area, and draft the \\"Regulations of the Provincial Consultative Councils\\", which was scheduled to be completed in 1914.  Military = Officer training  In 1901, the imperial government abolished the test of traditional Chinese Martial and founded the training system for officers. Then, in 1903, the Central Training Command was established to coordinate the training of national army.  Ordnance  In 1901, the imperial government established three arsenals in Hanyang, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.  Army  In 1905, the Beiyang Army was reorganized into a new type of army. The imperial government originally planned to establish 500,000 regular troops in the next ten years, but until the end of 1911 (the collapse of Qing Dynasty), only about 190,000 troops had been well trained. An edict on 15 July 1909 was passed that established the Ministry of War to control the army.  Navy  In 1902, Beiyang Navy officer Sazhen Bing proposed four methods for reviving the Navy. First, sending naval officers to study in Japan. Second, setting up a naval school in Jiangyin. Third, building Mawei Shipyard as a ship repair base. Forth, setting up naval guard town in Yantai and Fuzhou.  Other aspect  The policies reformed almost every aspect of governmental affairs: * In education, traditional academies became western-style schools and abolished the imperial examinations. Each province established a military academy. * A new code and judicial system came in law. The system of fiscal control and tax collection expanded and regularized, an especially important task since the Boxer Indemnity required payments to foreign powers which exceeded the annual income of the national government. * Local and regional police forces were organized, with model prisons opened.  Evaluation  The impact of these reforms varied from place to place. Many regions were virtually unchanged, while the provinces in the lower Yangzi valley had already taken the lead. The province of Zhili (roughly present day Hebei) was a model. With the strong support of the Empress Dowager, Yuan Shikai set up a strong bureaucracy to administer tax collection, local schools and police. However, there is still debate among the academic community regarding the actual effect that these reforms had on the Chinese people, historian Immanuel Hs√º claiming that, apart from the successes in \\"...the abolition of the civil service examinations‚Ä¶ the establishment of modern schools‚Ä¶ and the sending of students abroad‚Ä¶‚Äù,Hs√º, I 2000, The Rise of Modern China, 6th edn, Oxford University Press, New York. p.412 the reforms were \\"‚Ä¶essentially a noisy demonstration without much substance or promise of accomplishment‚Ä¶\\".Hs√º, I 2000, The Rise of Modern China, 6th edn, Oxford University Press, New York. p.412 However, other historians, such as Diana Preston, place much greater weight on the influence of these reforms on the later development of China in its progression towards a more 'developed' society, contending that \\"‚Ä¶the events of 1900 and their aftermath precipitated reforms that, albeit late [and] grudging, were far-reaching and laid the foundations for a modern state‚Ä¶\\".Preston, D 2000, The Boxer Rebellion The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners That Shook the World in the Summer of 1900, 1 edn, Bloomsbury Publishing, London., p.364. On 22 July 1908 the Qing government issued the Principles of the Constitution (Qinding Xianfa Dagang), modeled on the Japanese Meiji Constitution, which provided for gradual introduction of an electoral system beginning with local elections in 1908, followed in two years by elections for provincial legislatures, then two years later, elections for a national assembly. Special bureaus were set up in each province to prepare for setting up assemblies, directly subordinated to the provincial governor and consisting of scholars and gentry. They set up regulations for carrying out the elections, a timetable for carrying them out, and notices. The first to hold elections for the provincial assembly was the Jiangsu province, in 1909, and elections occurred on time in all provinces except for Xinjiang. The New Policies also resulted in drastic change of the Manchu policy toward Mongolia from a relatively conservative-protective one to an aggressive-colonial one.Mongolia in the Twentieth Century: Landlocked Cosmopolitan, pp. 39-41 The New Policies are judged now to have been a substantive beginning for China's reorganization which was destroyed after the death of the Dowager Empress in 1908 by the intransigent stand of conservative Manchus in the Qing court.

Created and hosted by Julie Sabatier, the show explores do-it-yourself ideas from a wide range of perspectives. Rendered centers around creative people as well as the processes and resources used to create various skills, communities, and ideas. History Rendered began as a half-hour monthly show titled DIY, Portland on KBOO Community Radio in 2006. When it began airing on Oregon Public Broadcasting in 2010, it changed its name to Destination DIY and hour-long running time. In September 2014, the show joined the national podcast and radio show network Maximum Fun. In February 2015, the show changed its name to Rendered. The last episode appeared 8/31/2015. Format Each episode features edited interviews with individuals, connected by narrative commentary from Sabatier. Topics include gender and the economy, as well as more traditional DIY topics, such as construction of tiny houses.http://destinationdiy.org/post/55537838823/daunting-diy- episodehttp://destinationdiy.org.hostbaby.com/episodes/episode29.htmlhttp://destinationdiy.org/post/27782362074/diy- economy-episode Sabatier told Portland Monthly magazine that each minute of the show takes about an hour to create, from recording interviews to editing the episode's final cut. Rendered broadcasts full shows and show segments in the Pacific Northwest through NPR's Northwest News Network and nationwide through Public Radio Exchange. The show is also available as a free podcast.http://destinationdiy.org/archives Rendered segments air on several radio stations, including Oregon Public Broadcasting, Austins's KUT, and San Francisco's KALW. Response The Portland Mercury described the format of Rendered in an article about Portland podcasts: \\"Destination DIY goes beyond the crafts 'n' home repair often associated with the term 'DIY' to encompass anything people can do themselves‚Äîfrom home funerals and taxidermy to representing yourself in court. Moreover, the show maintains an artful balance of general interest content and local events.\\" In January 2011, Sunset named Sabatier \\"Portland's DIY Queen\\" and wrote that the show \\"taps into the zeitgeist that is red hot in the West.\\" Radio Survivor reported on Destination DIY's crowd-funding strategy in 2013 and described the show as a \\"polished production on par with a national public radio program.\\" Portland television station KGW has reported on two Rendered \\"Makin' It\\" parties.http://www.kgw.com/thesquare/PDX-Tonight-Makin-It-with-Destination- DIY-148988305.html Sustainable Business Oregon also reported on the \\"Makin' It\\" parties and featured an interview with Sabatier. Funding Rendered is primarily listener-funded. In 2011, the show funded a year-long season with a Kickstarter campaign that raised $9,750. In 2013, the show relaunched as a monthly podcast after raising $14,801 in an IndieGoGo campaign. The show also lists several business and non-profit sponsors and received Regional Arts & Culture Council grants in 2011 and 2013.https://www.racc.org/about/racc- awards-661543-nonprofit-organizations-schools-and-individual-artists-arts- related-projecthttp://destinationdiy.org/supporters Rendered episodes ;Hour-long episodes * \\"Representing Yourself\\" (August 17, 2010) * \\"DIY Economy\\" (August 26, 2010) * \\"Doing It Ourselves\\" (November 9, 2010) * \\"DIY Rituals\\" (Released December 3, 2010) * \\"I Made That\\" (March 24, 2011) * \\"DIY Disasters\\" (January 22, 2012) * \\"Conversations\\" (April 19, 2012) * \\"You Are An Authority\\" (February 21, 2013) * \\"Old School DIY\\" (Released June 25, 2013) * \\"Daunting DIY\\" (July 15, 2013) ;Podcast-only episodes * \\"Collective Nouns\\" (October 17, 2010) * \\"Economy of Kids\\" (February 24, 2011) * \\"Worm Bin Disaster\\" (November 15, 2011) * \\"Fish Disasters\\" (November 29, 2011) * \\"Chariots of Rubber\\" (December 12, 2011) * \\"Disaster Challenge\\" (December 7, 2011) * \\"DIY Book Tour\\" (December 21, 2011) * \\"High Rocks\\" (January 25, 2012) * \\"Gloria's Secret Cafe\\" (March 29, 2012) * \\"Seattle Maker Faire\\" (June 4, 2012) * \\"The Un-Road Trip\\" (August 1, 2012) * \\"From the XOXO Festival\\" (September 18, 2012) ;Podcast and radio episodes * \\"Salty & Sweet\\" (November 11, 2013) * \\"DIY Kids\\" (January 17, 2014) * \\"For the Love of Bees\\" (February 17, 2014) * \\"Figures in Flight\\" (March 10, 2014) * \\"Love, DIY Style\\" (August, 2014) * \\"Mother of Invention\\" (September 29, 2014) * \\"Teen Inventors\\" (July 21, 2014) * \\"Health Care Hackers\\" (June 21, 2014) * \\"Hvoom with Hvam\\" (May 19, 2014) * \\"The Sweet Science\\" (April 21, 2014) Thirty-one older episodes are archived on Radio for All.

It featured American rodeo's three roughstock events: bareback bronc riding, saddle bronc riding and bull riding. History The organization was founded in 2001. Though in its earliest years it was composed of a few annual stand-alone events, it was eventually formed into a formal sporting league. 12 bareback Bronc riders, 12 saddle bronc riders and 12 bull riders were included in each event. They each paid an entry fee to compete. All competitors competed in the first round. The top four riders in each category then moved on to the championship round to determine the event champions with the two highest scores. When the regular season ended, the top 12 riders in each event based on points would qualify for the PRS World Finals. The top riders based on overall points for the year were crowned the PRS World Champions. The first world finals event took place in 2012 in Salina, Kansas. The second world finals took place in Rapid City, South Dakota. The third world finals also took place in Rapid City. The 2015 PRS regular season ended two-thirds of the way in without its planned world finals event, which was scheduled to take place in Amarillo, Texas. In October 2015, the Professional Roughstock Series announced on its website that it was suspending operations. It was due to the loss of financial backing and the inexperience of leadership that was its ultimate demise.

History Odakyu opened both the Odaky≈´ Odawara Line electric railway from Tokyo to Odawara and the Muk≈çgaoka Y≈´en amusement park in 1927. Initially, the park was connected to the nearest station by a miniature railway, but plans to build a major road across the line led Odakyu to replace it with a monorail.Demery, Leroy W. Monorails in Japan , p.25. Carquinez Associates, 2005. Built for ¬•200 million ($550,000 in 1966 dollars), the short 1.1-km line was the first monorail built by the Nihon-Lockheed Monorail Company, a joint venture of aerospace company Lockheed with Kawasaki Aerospace Company. A trip lasted only three minutes, with the line's single two-car train running every 15 minutes during park opening hours. At ¬•100/160 one-way/return, the fare was cheaper than the regular city bus (¬•200), and was thus used by some local residents as well. By the end of the 1990s, the line was serving only on average 900 passengers a day. Cracks were discovered in the vehicle in February 2000, leading Odakyu to suspend operations and eventually decide that the estimated ¬•380 million replacement cost could not be justified. The amusement park closed shortly afterwards in 2002.

Mullan is best known for acting, writing and producing the 2012 Queer Acts Theatre Festival show Sissydude, A Dandy Rock Musical, 2013's Best of the Coast bronze medal winner. Previously, Mullan wowed audiences with his breakthrough starring role in Trrrash productions' 2009 staging of John Cameron Mitchell's musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Mullan is currently the Artistic Director of Trrrash Productions, and resides with fifteen foster cats in a haunted house under the A. Murray MacKay Bridge in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada. Early life Mullan was born in Carleton Place, Ontario on February 8, 1984, to Robert and Marianne Mullan. While George Orwell's 1984 made many accurate predictions about the world that would greet us that year, he did not anticipate the glorious arrival of this young star. Mullan is the nephew of noted character actor Ross Mullan, best known for his role as a White Walker in the hit HBO fantasy drama Game of Thrones.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1368643/ Ian graduated Mount Allison University in 2006. After attending the inaugural Sappy Festival in 2005 as back-up dancer and hype man for Shotgun Jimmie, Mullan became a regular fixture of the festival, serving as a beacon of glitter in a sea of ironic plaid. Career Mullan founded his own theatre company, trrrash productions, in Halifax in 2009. \\"trrrash was a name chosen to conjure images of gritty theatre with a healthy dose of humility‚Äî ‚Äúwe‚Äôre named after garbage!‚Äù\\" The company made its d√©but in the summer of 2009, presenting John Cameron Mitchell's cult classic Hedwig and the Angry Inch. This was quickly followed by The Santaland Diaries, an adaptation of David Sedaris memoir, in December 2009. Trrrash has staged several productions since its inception, including two original works, Sissydude, A Dandy Rock Musical (2012,2013) and Bend (2013). The success of Sissydude's original run at the 2012 Queer Acts Theatre Festival resulted in its revival in February 2013. Mullan was also featured on the cover of Wayves Magazine in 2012, along with the musical's production staff. Personal life Mullan currently works as the visitor and events co- ordinator at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, coordinating weddings and entertaining visiting seamen. In 2017, Ian married his partner, Joshua Cadegan-Syms, noted statistician and intellectual. Together, they live with their two dogs in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Awards In 2013, Mullan won a Coast Best of Awards bronze medal for the hit production Sissydude, A Dandy Rock Musical. Mullan was a runner up for best Poutine, Best Actor and Sauciest Producer in the Coast but never received mention due to overwhelming jealousy from peers. Mullan also won the Miss personality award during the 2013 Sissydude cast party, due in large part to his heart-wrenching rendition of Mitchell's Origin of Love, with the production's stage manager Drunk Mom.

Her first novel, Women on the Breadfruit Tree, appeared in serialized form in the daily newspaper Ming Pao. She has written more than forty widely acclaimed books, including novels and essay collections. She was named one of the ten richest Chinese authors in 2013, as well as one of the ten most influential microbloggers on Weibo, with more than 64 million followers.  Biography  Cheung was born in Hong Kong. She attended Hong Kong Baptist College, during which time she worked part-time as a scenarist and on the administrative staff of a TV station. Her first novel, Women on the Breadfruit Tree, was published in 1995, and as of 2014, Cheung has written more than 40 novels, most of which are in the romance genre. Her works have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines over the past two decades, particularly in the Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily. Cheung also founded the magazine Amy in 1998. Works Cheung's books are described as romance or chick lit, though their endings are often bittersweet or tragic. Many of her books depict relationships strained by social conventions or taboos that are characteristic of Chinese culture. In Hummingbirds Fly Backwards, a young woman who is the manager of a lingerie shop has an affair with a married man who will not leave his wife due to the stigma of divorce. The book is popular for its portrayal of the pressures felt by unmarried women in their late twenties or older, known as xing nu (\\"blooming women\\") in Hong Kong but socially stigmatized and referred to as sheng nu (\\"leftover women\\") in mainland China, where marriage rates are as high as over 90 percent for women aged 35. The original Cantonese title (Three A-Cup Women) is a tongue- in-cheek play on the term \\"A-quality women.\\" A Chinglish pun that can be understood by locals in the former British Hong Kong, \\"A-Cup\\" refers to the characters' bra cup sizes and sounds identical to \\"AÁ¥ö\\" (Jyutping: kap1), or \\"A-quality,\\" a term used to describe desirable women who are considered \\"the total package.\\" In For Love or Money, a mother from a well-to-do family hatches a plot to manipulate her son into abandoning his dreams of becoming an artist and joining the family business.

When it opens in 2020, it will be the second legal casino in Sydney, the other being The Star. However, unlike The Star, Crown Sydney's casino will only operate with VIP membership restrictions. With 75 floors (including mezzanines) and a height of , it surpassed Chifley Tower as the tallest building in Sydney, topping out in March 2020. History and subsequent planning approvals James Packer's casino group, Crown Resorts, presented an A$1 billion+ proposal to Premier Barry O'Farrell in February 2012 to build a hotel, casino and entertainment complex at the site on land that was set aside for open space at Barangaroo Central. The Premier initially welcomed the proposal, yet cautioned it would need to gain regulatory approval before going ahead. The proposal drew widespread criticism from the Lord Mayor Clover Moore, Paul Keating, and former government architect, Chris Johnson. In October 2012, Premier O'Farrell announced that the NSW Cabinet reviewed the proposal and decided that the government will enter into detailed negotiations with Crown Limited for the establishment of a casino and hotel complex at Barangaroo. Tony Harris, a former NSW Auditor General was critical of the decision‚àímaking process, claiming the public could miss out on millions of dollars. Packer wrote a defence of his proposal for the press. In July 2013 after a recommendation from an independent steering committee, O'Farrell announced the Crown proposal would be moved to Stage 3 of the unsolicited proposals process, the final stage where the parties will negotiate a binding contract. The government is to receive a $100 million upfront fee for the licence, despite being offered $250 million with alternative tax arrangements which the steering committee's economic advisor Deloitte calculated was a superior offer. Crown's intention is to lure Chinese high-rollers to its Sydney casino leveraging off its interests in its Macau casinos and taking advantage of a new streamlined visa process introduced by the Australian government for Chinese citizens wanting to gamble at Australian casinos. In November 2013, it was announced that Crown Sydney received approval for the casino licence and place at Barangaroo. In November 2015, Packer expressed his frustrations over the delaying of the project from strenuous government planning laws. Following this in March 2016, a series of proposals to change aspects of the building were recommended by the State Government in order for the project to receive final approval. This included the introduction of a new recess in the interior as well as new cladding on the south side of the building. An observation deck as well as public access to the upper floors was also proposed. In June 2016, the casino received final approval from the Planning Assessment Commission on condition that the casino met needs proposed by the commission, including adequate public spaces and access. Despite this approval, the Millers Point Fund lodged legal action against the project in early August 2016 challenging the validity of the casino and aiming to have construction on the project halted. Crown Resorts responded, stating they would \\"vigorously defend\\" their actions. The dispute was held in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales in late August, with a decisive dismissal of the Millers Point Fund's claims. Construction ultimately began in October 2016, with the structure topping out in March 2020. An ultimate completion date of December 2020 has been scheduled. Initial revisions estimated a completion date in 2021, however this has since been re-revised to late 2020. File:Crown Sydney2.jpgConstruction in July 2019 File:Crown Sydney UC in December 2019.jpgCrown Sydney in December 2019 File:Crown Sydney topped out 2.jpgCrown Sydney in February 2020 Sociological criticism Researchers from the Responsible Gambling Fund financed, University of Sydney Gambling Treatment Clinic, have suggested that strategies such as a minimum bet size are not likely to prevent the local community from being affected by problem gambling. They have suggested that students, new immigrants and working class individuals are typically and more likely found to be losing large amounts of money at Casino style table and electronic games. Academic researchers have suggested that while the casino is initially not licensed to offer poker machines, it will inevitably gain a licence in future years.

Though the Affordable Care Act was signed into federal law in 2010, implementation of the menu labeling requirements was delayed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration several times until they went into effect on May 7, 2018.Affordable Care Act's calorie count rules go into effect This act falls under Title IV of the ACA: Prevention of Chronic Disease and Improving Public Health, which seeks to \\"transition from a system focused primarily on treating the sick to one that helps keep people well throughout their lives.\\" Section 4205 is an amendment to the nutrition labeling requirements of Section 403(q)(5) in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA). Section 4205 mandates labeling nutrition information for foods at chain restaurants and vending machine items to help consumers make more informed food choices.  Importance  Section 4205 of the ACA addresses the issues of obesity and chronic disease by raising awareness of calories consumed outside of the home, as, according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, these types of calories increase obesity; a disease that cost the U.S. $147 billion in health care expenses in 2008.  Proposed Requirements = Covered Establishments  The FDA‚Äôs Proposed Requirements under Section 4205 apply to all ‚Äúrestaurants or similar retail food establishments with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and offering for sale substantially the same menu items.\\" The primary business activity of a covered establishment is the sale of food to consumers. A business is covered under this requirement if: # The establishment presents itself as a restaurant, or # More than 50% of the establishments total floor area is used for the sale of food. Not covered under these regulations are: * Movie theaters; * Mass transit (such as airplanes); * Bowling alleys; * All other establishments that do not exist for the primary purpose to sell food. Caloric Information Establishments must provide a calorie display, statement regarding calorie intake, and additional written nutrition information available upon request. Calorie Display * Disclose calorie count on all menus and menu boards, labelled with the words \\"Calories\\" or \\"Cal\\"; * Clear and prominent display of calories; * Disclose calorie ranges for variable menu items; * Display of calories contained per serving of foods on display or self-service foods, such as salad bars, buffets, and fountain beverages; * Food items that do not require a calorie count include: condiments and other general use items, daily specials and items appearing on the menu for less than 90 days. Statement of Caloric Intake Covered establishments must provide consumers a ‚Äúsuccinct statement concerning suggested daily caloric intake‚Äù, which is intended to increase consumers‚Äô contextual awareness of their food choice in relation their recommended daily caloric intake. Additional Written Nutritional Information * Statement of availability of additional written nutrition information available upon request must be displayed on menus and menu boards. * Additional nutrition information for standard menu items must include total calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, trans fat, sodium, total carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber and protein. Furthermore, nutrition information is to be established on a ‚Äòreasonable basis‚Äô through nutrient analysis, cookbooks, or nutrient databases. In the case that there are variations in menu items (i.e. soft drinks, flavors, toppings and combination meals), the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish standards to account for these differences.  Vending Machines  Under Section 4205, owners of 20 or more vending machines must make calorie information for each item sold in the machine visible to consumers prior to purchase, either by making nutrition information on individual packages visible or by posting calorie information in close proximity to the food. Calorie Display * Display calorie information clearly and prominently; * Utilize the term \\"Calorie\\" or \\"Cal\\" on postings of caloric information; * Post calorie information on a sign in close proximity to the article of food or the selection button with a ‚Äúclear and conspicuous statement disclosing the number of calories contained in the article.‚Äù  Other  Restaurants and vending machine owners who are not subject to the law may voluntarily participate by registering with the Secretary of Health and Human Services within 120 days of enactment.  Implementation  The requirement to implement these changes has been extended to an additional year, to May 7, 2018. Provisions for the nutrition labeling of standard menu items at chain restaurants became effective on March 23, 2010, when President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. Because specific provisions of the law depend on rules developed by the Food and Drug Administration, certain requirements could not be immediately enforced.  Provisions of Section 4205 Immediately Required upon the Passage of the ACA  Immediately upon enactment of the law, the following provisions of Section 4205 were required: Restaurants or similar food establishments covered by the provision were required to: * Disclose the number of calories of each standard menu item on menus and menu boards; * Make available written nutrition information to consumers upon request; * State the availability of written nutrition information in a \\"prominent, clear, and conspicuous\\" manner on menus and menu boards; and * Provide calorie information, per serving/food item, for self-service items and food on display, on a sign adjacent to each food item. Chain vending machine operators covered by the provision were required to: * Disclose the number of calories in each food article on a sign located in close proximity to each article of food (or the selection button), unless the Nutrition * Facts Panel is visible to the consumer. This information must be visible to the consumer prior to purchasing the items. Despite the requirement of these provisions immediately upon enactment of the law, several provisions cannot be enforced until the regulations are finalized. The FDA must establish the requirements for the following provisions before they may be enforced: * Requirements for a statement on the menu or menu board to include calorie information in terms of total daily caloric intake; and * Standards to determine and disclose nutrient content for standard menu items that come in different flavors, varieties or combinations, however, they are listed as a single menu item. The FDA may issue additional nutrient disclosure regulations under Section 4205, at their discretion, to further assist the public in making healthy eating choices.  Challenges = Cost  Covered Establishments = The FDA estimates the initial cost of compliance to be $315 million with a continuous annual cost of approximately $44 million; however, the food industry estimates that the total costs of completing nutrition analyses, updating labelling, training employees, and developing new menu boards will be roughly 1 billion dollars. According to the FDA‚Äôs Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, there are three elements of cost for this rule: # Collecting and managing nutritional analysis records; # Revising or replacing existing menus and menu boards; and # Employee training. According to the FDA, 27% of restaurant chains have obtained the necessary nutrition analysis information for their menu items that comply with state and local regulations. These establishments will not experience additional expenses associated with compliance to national policy. = Vending Machines = Over 5 million vending machines, maintained by roughly 10,800 companies, will be required to comply with nutrition labelling regulations under section 4205. The FDA estimates the cost to display this information at $25.8 million initially, with additional $24 million per year for subsequent upkeep.  Pre-existing Laws at the State and Local Level  Some states imposed nutrition labeling regulations prior to the enactment of the ACA. Section 4205 prohibits states from imposing nutrition labeling requirements that are different from or not included in section 4205. The FDA‚Äôs proposed regulations in relationship to State and local laws: * Prohibits State and local government to impose different or additional requirements for food sold in covered establishments under the Federal law; * Enables State and local governments to establish nutrition labeling requirements for establishments not covered under Federal law.

Cazale, which is a small village in Haiti about 45 miles away from Port-au-Prince in the Grand'Anse Department, is the main center of population of the Polish community in Haiti, called La Pologne (Poland). The name Cazale, or the home of Zalewski as many locals believe, originates from the popular Polish surname Zalewski and the Haitian Creole word for home (); is the home to those of Polish descent. History Dating back to the Haitian Revolution, the Polish influence started in the town of Cazale. In 1802, Napoleon added a Polish legion of around 5,200 to the forces sent to Saint- Domingue to fight off the slave rebellion. However, the Poles were told that there was a revolt of prisoners in Saint-Domingue. Upon arrival the Polish platoon soon discovered that what was actually taking place in the colony was a rebellion of slaves fighting off their French masters for their freedom. During this time, there was a familiar situation going on back in their homeland as these Polish soldiers were fighting for their liberty from the occupying forces of Russia, Prussia and Austria that began in 1772. As hopeful as the Haitians, many Poles were seeking union amongst themselves to win back their freedom and independence by organizing an uprising. As a result, many Polish soldiers admired their opponents, to eventually turn on the French army and join the Haitian slaves. Polish soldiers participated in the Haitian revolution of 1804, contributing to the establishment of the world's first free black republic and the first independent Caribbean state. For their loyalty and support in overthrowing the French, the Poles acquired Haitian citizenship after Haiti gained its independence. Haiti's first head of state Jean-Jacques Dessalines called Polish people \\"the White Negroes of Europe\\", which was then regarded a great honour, as it meant brotherhood between Poles and Haitians. Many years later Fran√ßois Duvalier, the president of Haiti who was known for his black nationalist and Pan-African views, used the same concept of \\"European white negroes\\" while referring to Polish people and glorifying their patriotism. In the \\"Papa Doc\\" era, the small town of Cazale became a communist stronghold where many young intellectuals clashed with the dictator's regime. As a result of their political indifference, March 29, 1969 became known as the worst day for the people of Cazale as Duvalier's Tonton Macoute (private army), built a barricade around Cazale, and murdered many young men. In 1983, Pope John Paul II visited Haiti. He mentioned how the Polish contributed to the slave rebellion leading to Haiti's independence. Several Haitian Poles were selected from the most populous Polish areas of Haiti by Duvalier to attend the various ceremonies planned for the Pope's visit. One of the most worshiped Polish religious symbols is the icon named the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa which was absorbed by Haitian Voodoo as Erzulie, or Ezili Dantor. This image of black Virgin Mary holding the dark- skinned Infant Jesus that influenced the vision of one of the Haitian Loa spirits was originally brought to Haiti by the Polish soldiers who settled there and never returned to Poland. To this day, many Polish Haitians still live in Haiti and are of mixed racial origin, as some have blonde hair, light eyes, and other European features. Most settled in Cazale, La Vall√©e-de- Jacmel, Fond-des-Blancs, La Baleine, Port-Salut and Saint-Jean-du-Sud.

He spent almost a decade as an administrator at the UCLA School of Law before leaving in 1980 to become a full-time agent. Slaughter has represented professional basketball and American football players. He was also the labor union leader for referees in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Early life Slaughter grew up in Topeka, Kansas. He attended Topeka High School, where he was the leading scorer on their basketball team, as well as the top player in Kansas. Despite a weight problem, he was also a state-champion sprinter in the 100-yard dash. He was timed at 9.9 seconds in the 100 and was sought after by multiple colleges as a track athlete. Slaughter was heavily recruited by universities, and received 104 athletic scholarship offers. Instead of staying in-state and attending college at University of Kansas or Kansas State University, Slaughter wanted to attend UCLA. He preferred the \\"better weather\\", and he wanted to go to a basketball program he \\"could help get on the map.\\" Since UCLA's basketball coach, John Wooden, did not recruit outside of California, Slaughter wrote Wooden and asked to join their team. Wooden had coached at UCLA for 12 years, where the Bruins were consistent winners but not yet a powerhouse. The school offered him a scholarship split between track and basketball. College career Slaughter chose to attend UCLA, part of a trend their basketball team developed to build a strong nucleus of native California athletes along with a few African Americans from out of state. The school developed a reputation for fair treatment of blacks. In his first year, Slaughter led the freshman basketball team in scoring, a feat he also matched on the freshman track team. However, Slaughter did not excel in any particular track event. At , he was considered small for a center, and his scoring opportunities decreased as his career progressed; his role was reduced to setting screens and other less glamorous duties. Still, Slaughter was the tallest member of UCLA's 1963‚Äì64 team, but the Bruins outrebounded each of their opponents during their 30‚Äì0 season. This included their championship game against the Duke Blue Devils, who had two starters (Hack Tison and Jay Buckley), but the Bruins outrebounded them 51‚Äì44 and forced 29 turnovers in a 98‚Äì83 victory. It was Wooden's first championship, and the beginning of a UCLA dynasty that would win nine of the next 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During the season, UCLA ran a 2-2-1 zone press; it was fronted by Gail Goodrich and Slaughter, who was broad enough at to make breaking the press difficult for opponents, but fast enough to race back if they advanced the ball. In each of their 30 games, the Bruins used the press to produce at least one run of two or three minutes where they outscored the opposition by at least 10 points. Known as \\"Bruin Blitzes\\", these often occurred before halftime. \\"There's nobody who doesn't want to score, and it took the edge off it for me,\\" said Slaughter. \\"But how could I question it? It was successful.\\" In 2004, Slaughter was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional career After he graduated with a bachelor's degree in marketing, Slaughter earned an MBA at UCLA. Urged by friends such as former Bruins teammates Goodrich and Walt Hazzard, he also earned a law degree at Columbia University. He became a sports agent in 1969, when there were few in the industry and he was virtually the lone African American. \\"People hadn't really realized that the professional athlete needed help,\\" Slaughter said. \\"\\"I realized it and went to school and did everything I had to do to prepare for that.\\" From 1972 to 1980, Slaughter served as assistant dean of Admissions and Student Affairs for the UCLA School of Law from 1972 to 1980. Afterwards, he became an agent full-time. During his career, Slaughter has represented pro basketball and American football players. By 1989, he was the only black to have become a top agent for National Basketball Association (NBA) players. The New York Times in 1995 called Slaughter the \\"dean of black sports attorneys.\\" His clients have included Hall of Fame basketball players Dennis Johnson, Jamaal Wilkes, and Clyde Drexler. Slaughter was also leader of the National Basketball Referees Association (NBRA), the labor union for referees in the NBA. In 1990, he sent a memo to referees advising them to \\"not to try to get cute with your receipts\\"; however, multiple referees were later found guilty of tax evasion by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for falsifying expense reports on their airline tickets. He also represented the NBRA during their lockout from the league in 1995. Personal life Slaughter married his wife, Kay, who earned a bachelor's degree in nursing from UCLA and became a hospital nurse. They had two children. He died on October 6, 2016, at the age of 74 in Santa Monica, California.

Plot  Anna Carson awakens from a recurring nightmare, and later has unsatisfying sex with her husband, a businessman named David, as a prowler watches the two of them through their living room window. The next morning, Anna and David argue about the long hours David has been working, and about how bad their sex has become. Anna then drives into town, followed by the voyeur, as her car radio discusses the Long Island Rape Murderer, a serial killer who has been raping and killing women and children. At a train station, Anna meets Maggie Ronson, a photographer who later tracks Anna down to a beauty salon, to return a datebook Anna had dropped. In the Carson home, Anna and David discuss their failing marriage before David goes to work, where he makes dinner plans with his secretary. While out shopping one night, Anna is sexually assaulted by the Long Island Rape Murderer. After Maggie invites her over, Anna confides in Maggie about being attacked, and the two enter a relationship, while David begins an affair of his own with his secretary. The Long Island Rape Murderer continues to stalk Anna, steals objects like pictures and underwear from her, and has erotic fantasies about her. Anna has sex with David (flashing back to being raped in the midst) and afterward tells him about how she believes Maggie can help their floundering relationship. The Long Island Rape Murderer is shown angrily destroying a photograph of Anna, who has dinner with David and Maggie, then a threesome. After the trio finish, Maggie is revealed to be the Long Island Rape Murderer, and she shoots David and Anna. The police arrive, and as they arrest the seemingly catatonic Maggie, she shoots a detective, and is turn brought down in a hail of gunfire by a lieutenant.

Accessed 2014-02-07. Wind and swell were high and 296 tonnes of bunker fuel were released into Spencer Gulf. The incident resulted in 500 oiled birds and damage to 15 km of mangrove and seagrass habitat south- west of Port Pirie.  Spill = 30 August  Port Bonython, Upper Spencer Gulf The spill occurred at 10.52am, as the Era was berthing at the Port Bonython wharf in rough seas. The vessel had arrived to load oil for the Kwinana refinery. The Era was chartered by BP and the tugboat involved, Turmoil, was property of the Adelaide Steamship Company.Pearce, Wade \\"Chemicals attacking 2km slick - Oil spill threat to Gulf animals\\" The Advertiser, South Australia (1992-08-31). Also present were the tugboat Taminga and the line-boat Wanilla. A lug on the Turmoil's bow pierced the hull of the tanker, leaving a 20 cm hole in the hull and rupturing her fuel tank.

A total of 296 tonnes of heavy fuel oil had escaped into the sea.  Response  The slick was described in the official report as \\"a moderate sheen with streaks of heavy dark oil moving round the stern of the vessel.\\" Tug boats were driven through the slick in an attempt to break it up, and the spraying of chemical dispersant commenced soon after the spill occurred. 400 litres of Corexit 7764 and 4200 litres of Corexit 9527 were supplied by Santos. The absence of an appropriate crane at the jetty made loading Turmoil with dispersant at Port Bonython impossible. Instead, the tugboat proceeded to Whyalla to load, while the dispersant was transported there by road. The Santos-owned Shark Cat Tregalana loaded in Santos' boat harbor. The other vessels present were unable to assist due to the Wanilla requiring towing by the Taminga. A line had fouled its propeller during the berthing of the Era. Three different chemical dispersants were used: Corexit 7764, Corexit 9527 and Ardrox 6120. Strong north-westerly winds of up to 25 knots combined with tide and current initially transported the oil slick eastwards, towards Port Germein. The high winds prevented the early use of containment booms.

The spill had attracted national news media attention.\\"Editorial Opinion - Grave Reminder\\" Whyalla News, South Australia (1992-09-01) A visible 10-20 tonne slick remained on the water's surface after the majority of the oil had been sprayed with chemical dispersant. The dispersal of the slick involved 50 people, five boats, a helicopter and spotter aircraft. 25 Special Emergency Services (SES) personnel were placed on standby. Staff from the Australian Marine Oil Spill Centre (AMOSC) were present to supervise the use of booms to channel the oil, and some oil was recovered by this method. At this time, there had been no reports of dead fish or birds. About 10 volunteers were ready at Port Pirie to handle any oiled wildlife. Council workers were also dispatched from the Mount Remarkable District Council to assist. Professional fishermen, including the 39-member Spencer Gulf Prawn Fishermen's Association called for an independent inquiry into the incident and a review of all berthing procedures. Spokesperson Mick Puglisi stated that he believed the Era should never have berthed in such extreme weather. A Department of Marine and Harbors spokesman said that it was unlikely that anyone would be charged under the Marine Pollution by Oil and Noxious Substances Act. Local pilot Syd Cheesman said that he had seen places where \\"the oil is on the bottom and the water is on top of it.\\" He also described the slick as covering \\"an extensive area\\".Uren, Kate \\"Oil slick clean-up continues - Concerns\\" The Recorder, Port Pirie, South Australia (1992-09-02) Pg.1  2 September ‚Äì Day 4  About 10 tonnes of oil had washed into mangroves overnight. A slick 15 km long had been seen drifting 1 km off Port Pirie. A makeshift animal hospital was established in Port Pirie. Small boats searched at first light for oiled birds. The visible oil was described by David Gray of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority as 'a sheen on the water'. Some of this sheen impacted the mangroves and a number of tidal creeks to the south-west of Port Pirie. The estimated number of impacted birds was revised from 100 birds to up to 500 birds as the search and recovery efforts began. Rescuers expressed concern about the birds' ingestion of oil as a consequence of preening.Kriven, Sylvia \\"Wildlife dies in worst SA oil slick\\" The Advertiser, South Australia (1992-09-03). Pg.1.  3 September ‚Äì Day 5  The oil had settled in the mangroves south-west of Port Pirie. More than 500 birds had now been affected and 20 dead birds had been recorded. Prawn fishermen and Fisheries officers collected samples of prawn larvae and seabed sediment for analysis. Fisherman David Wilks participated in the bird rescue and recovery and described the scene: > \\"As the tides recede, oil is plastered black all over the mangroves, oil is > pouring out of the creeks with the tides and there's a film of oil left > behind which is seeping into the seagrass beds.\\" Teams of volunteers scrubbed oiled birds overnight and prepared them for transport to the RSPCA in Lonsdale. Treated birds included pelicans, cormorants, grebes and herons. More than a dozen dead birds were collected on this day.\\"Rescuers out to save birds from oil slick\\" The Canberra Times, Australian Capital Territory (1992-09-04). Retrieved 2013-11-20. Most of the dead birds recovered were cormorants. Fauna rescue researcher Ms Erna Walraven was intended to receive the dead birds in Sydney for further study. National Parks and Wildlife put a call out for more flat-bottomed boats and experienced boat operators to assist.Kriven, Sylvia \\"Desperate bid to save birds\\" The Advertiser, South Australia. (1992-09-03) Pg.2 Senior Environment and Planning Department officer Brian Wagstaff said the spill posed no long or medium-term ecological risk. He stated: \\"There won't be a die-back of mangroves, although there may be some loss of leaves... it's the birds that are the main concern.\\"\\"Wildlife dies in Gulf oil slick\\" The Advertiser, South Australia (1992-09-04).  Impact  At the time of the spill, environmental scientist Doug Reilly warned of the risk the slick posed to important breeding grounds of western king prawns. He also raised concerns about the potential threat chemical dispersant could pose to marine ecosystems. Mangrove and seagrass habitats were impacted, as were native birds and the local fishing industry.  Fishing industry  10 days after the spill, the South Australian Fishing Industry Council stated that 25 families had lost their income in the short term due to the spill. The Council stated that if the spill was found to have caused long-term damage to fishing grounds, millions of dollars in compensation would be sought from whoever was deemed liable.\\"Fishers may seek compo for spill income loss\\" The Canberra Times, Australian Capital Territory (1992-09-09).

The film depicts the Holodomor, a genocide committed by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin against Ukrainians to destroy their culture through mass starvation. The film stars Max Irons, Samantha Barks, Barry Pepper, Tamer Hassan and Terence Stamp. The film was directed by George Mendeluk and was written by Canadian screenwriter-actor Richard Bachynsky Hoover, based on his own Holodomor research. He was also credited as the executive producer, for arranging to have the film's investor, Canadian- Ukrainian president of Generation Capital Ian Ihnatowycz, be the primary producer. The film producers and crew used authentic Kyiv locations, sets and props.  Plot  The Ukrainian Cossack Ivan Kachanuik defends his family in the Central Ukraine country village Smila. Years later, in 1932, Ivan's artist grandson Yuri marries his childhood sweetheart, Natalka, and studies at the Kyiv Art Academy. His family are independent Cossack farmers, \\"kurkuli\\". They make a living from grain, sunflowers and other crops until Joseph Stalin's collectivisation campaign sends the Soviet army to requisition 90% of Ukraine's harvest. The State Art Institute is forced to replace the art instructors with communist instructors who censor art such as Yuri's, condemning its expression of Ukrainian cultural identity as anti Soviet. Yuri storms out in disgust. During a memorial in a pub for a friend who committed suicide a drunk Soviet captain insults the Ukrainians folklore, music, songs, and dance, starting a fight during which Yuri stabs the captain. Yuri is locked up in a brutal Soviet prison with farmers and nationalists and others whom Stalin deems \\"enemies of the people\\". He witnesses daily mass executions and is in line for execution himself when the prison director demands he paint his portrait in return for his life. Yuri is sure the director will have him killed as soon as the portrait is completed. During their second sitting Yuri stabs the director with his paintbrush, killing him, and escapes in the director's uniform during a snow blizzard while being hunted by the Bolshevik soldier guards. Meanwhile back in the Cossack farming village Smila, Yuri's wife and family are enduring the terror of farm director Commisar Sergei Koltsov. He attempts to rape Natalka and uses food as a weapon to control her but Natalka poisons his borscht with wild mushrooms. He survives as Natalka flees to joins the other peasant women. She plans a revolt which backfires and they are overpowered by the Bolshevik attack. Yuri's family and the villagers are imprisoned and tortured in the local church that becomes a makeshift torture chamber and prison cell. While being hunted by the Bolshevik police and soldiers in the northern Kyivan forests Yuri comes across a hungry desperate boy named Lubko who asks Yuri to help him survive as he offers his help through the forest to a cattle train stop towards Smila . That evening they are joined at their camp by the Kholodnoyarska Ukrainian Cossack detachment. They plan an attack on the Bolsheviks and wind up in a bloody battle the next morning against the Bolsheviks gatling gunning down the uprising. Both sides suffer heavy casualties. Yuri and Lubko survive and continue their journey towards Smila by sneaking aboard a cattle train full of starved Ukrainian corpses. They witness massive starvation and death of their fellow Ukrainians on the roadsides and in pits. Nearing Smila they hijack a loaded Soviet grain truck whose Bolshevik soldier driver immediately joins Yuri's rescue mission, bringing grain to Yuris family and the villagers. Yuri, Natalka, and Lubko escape, others of the family starve or are murdered by Koltsov's forces. They are pursued onto another cattle train of Ukrainian corpses on their way to be dumped into fire pits, and, jumping the train, are chased to the Soviet border, the cold and turbulent Zbruch River. They dodge bullets under water crossing to Polish-controlled West Ukraine to get to the city of Lviv, hoping for help from the priest Andrey Sheptytsky to exchange the vast rich pastures of Ukraine for the prairies of Manitoba, Canada.  Cast  Production  Researching his father Yaroslav's Ukrainian heritage and roots, and reading many books about Ukraine's history, Bachynsky Hoover decided to visit the country in 1999, 2000 and in 2004. After his mother Ada had passed away from brain cancer, Bachynsky Hoover joined the half million protesting activists in the Orange Revolution that year. He realised that Stalin's Holodomor famine that had been waged across Ukraine had to be dramatised in an English language feature film in order to be acknowledged by the global masses unaware of the 1932/33 genocide. He rough drafted the screenplay over several years and in 2010 sought financing from the Ukrainian Government and various Ukrainian oligarchs, who were not interested. In 2011, he approached fellow Ukrainian Canadian investor Ian Ihnatowycz, who kickstarted Richards' screenplay research and its development and eventually in 2013 committed to financing the $21 million film in its entirety. Filming began on location in Ukraine by November 15, 2013, under its original title The Devil's Harvest. Attempting to uncover parts of Kremlin history, producer Ian Ihnatowycz stated, \\"Given the importance of the Holodomor, and that few outside Ukraine knew about this man-made famine because it had been covered up by the Kremlin regime, this chapter of history needed to be told in English on the silver screen for the first time in feature film history.\\" On February 5, 2014, Variety reported that the shoot had just ended in Kiev. Several local crew including Richard Bachynsky Hoover took part in the concurrent Euromaidan demonstrations. In early 2014, post-production continued at London's Pinewood Studios, using the official James Bond filming tank for underwater filming. Skyfall editor Stuart Baird and SFX teams worked on the film in post- production.  Release  The film was acquired by Roadside Attractions an Indy arm of Americas Lions Gate Films corp.for a 1st quarter 2017 US release. Roadside Attractions released the film in the US on February 24, 2017. \\"D\\" Films Canada will launch Bitter Harvest on March 3 in Canada as well as many other film distributors who have bought the rights for the film in major countries globally who will also launch the film during the first quarter of 2017.  Reception = Box office  The final US Canada Europe box office and Dvd sales were $5,570,241. Its widest release was in 127 USA theaters but screened in various venues and sold on Amazon and other online sites marketing dvd and many Pay Tv and pay streaming in more than 100 countries in 2017/18  Critical response  Bitter Harvest received generally negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 14% approval rating, based on 59 reviews. The consensus states, \\"Bitter Harvest lives down to its title with a clich√©d wartime romance whose clumsy melodrama dishonors the victims of the real-life horrors it uses as a backdrop.\\" Sheri Linden of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"utterly devoid of emotional impact\\". Several reviews agreed that the film would raise awareness, but did not do justice to the subject matter, with Peter Debruge of Variety stating that \\"there can be no doubt that the events deserve a more compelling and responsible treatment than this.\\" George Weigel of the National Review wrote that \\"the film, while perhaps not great cinema, succeeds in personalizing the Holodomor and reminding us that this genocide happened\\". Michael O'Sullivan wrote for The Washington Post, \\"The Holodomor ‚Äì an early 1930s famine in which millions of people in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, are said to have died when their foodstuffs were confiscated by the central Soviet government under Joseph Stalin ‚Äì could have made for a tale of great, stirring tragedy on the silver screen. 'Bitter Harvest,' alas, is not that movie.\\" The Ukrainian American Coordinating Council (UACC) criticized O'Sullivan's review for seeming to deny that the Holodomor was a man-made famine; The Washington Post later posted an editor's note clarifying that the Holodomor was \\"an act of genocide\\", and parts of the review were re-written. Among more positive reviews, Adrian Bryttan of The Ukrainian Weekly praised the film: \\"Director George Mendeluk is first and foremost a master director and Doug Milsome as a DOP as well Kingston Ontario born Canadian Richard Bachynsky Hoover is a master storyteller in his screenplay writing , breathing vivid life into the nuanced characters in their epic-romance ... Richly layered and rewarding repeated viewings, Bitter Harvest is the world-class Ukrainian art film of our time.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald called the film \\"a rousing tale with political pertinence\\".

The film stars an ensemble cast featuring Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Aaron Paul, Clifton Collins Jr., Norman Reedus, Teresa Palmer, Michael K. Williams, Gal Gadot, Woody Harrelson, and Kate Winslet. The film was released on February 26, 2016 in the United States by Open Road Films. The film polarized critics and audiences, and was a box office disappointment, grossing $25 million against its $20 million production budget. Plot In Atlanta, criminals Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Russell Welch (Norman Reedus) and his brother Gabe Welch (Aaron Paul), and corrupt cops Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.) rob a bank to retrieve a safe deposit box. The box contains information that could overturn the recent conviction of a Jewish-Russian Mafia boss. When Michael brings the safe deposit box to the boss' wife, Irina (Kate Winslet), she withholds their reward money and gives Michael and his crew another mission, which involves breaking into a government office and stealing more data on her husband. To convince them to take the job, the mafia tortures and then dumps a mortally wounded Russell off in front of the crew, forcing Michael to mercy-kill Russell in front of them, traumatizing Gabe. The group decides to go forward with the job. As they think of ways they can pull it off, Marcus and Franco suggest a Triple 9 scenario, which involves an officer down call that sends all of the police to the location of the incident, with Marcus nominating his new partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck) as the cop to be killed. Marcus tries to befriend Chris as they go out on calls together. During one call, Chris attempts to question a local gang member, Luis Pinto (Luis Da Silva), about a gang-related homicide, only for Luis to attack Chris before being detained for his actions. Chris's uncle, Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson), is a Sgt. Detective in the police force working on the bank robbery case. Jeffrey gets a lead and discovers that Gabe is one of the people involved in the bank robbery. Gabe, still grieving over his brother, tries to stop the heist from happening by following Chris and Marcus around and telling Chris, but is stopped both by Michael and Jeffrey. On the day of the heist, Marcus takes Chris to an abandoned housing project to meet an informant with information on their homicide case. As they walk around the building, Marcus slips away, and Luis comes in and tries to find Chris. Chris bumps into Gabe who tries to warn him that he is going to die. Luis then charges in and tries to shoot Chris but hits Gabe. As Luis runs away, Chris confronts a critically wounded Gabe. Before Gabe can say anything, Marcus comes in, triggering a shootout between the two. Gabe is killed, and Marcus is shot in the head. Fearing Marcus is dead, Chris makes the Triple 9 call. Thinking his nephew is the officer down, Jeffrey rushes to the scene. Meanwhile, Michael and Franco break into the government office and steal the information with little police disruption. Luis flees the projects and is later shot dead by SWAT after barricading himself in a nearby home. In the aftermath, Marcus survives but is in critical condition. Michael meets with Irina and her henchmen for the exchange. He has a gift for his son to give to him upon their reunion. Irina gives him the money but does not bring Michael's son as she had promised to earlier. Michael and Irina were earlier revealed to have a family relationship: the mother of Michael's son is Irina's sister; nonetheless, Irina refers to Michael as a \\"monkey.\\" After being beaten by her henchmen, Michael walks back to his car and triggers a bomb that was wired into his gift, killing Irina and her thugs. As he drives away, Michael is pulled over by Franco, who kills him and steals the money. After investigating Luis's belongings at the morgue, Chris finds a note in Luis's wallet, which contained the location where Marcus took him the day of the shooting. Chris later finds out that Marcus met Luis the day of the shooting, letting him know where to kill Chris. Angered, Chris visits an unconscious Marcus to try to get answers but is interrupted by Franco, who invites Chris back to the station to get his account of the shooting. As the two head to the car, Chris receives a call from Jeffrey, who tells him that Franco has been cleaning house and that he might be next. Chris, clutching his holstered weapon, stops and tells Franco that he'll meet him at the station. Franco, realizing Chris has been tipped of his involvement, agrees to meet Chris there. As the two head out to their respective cars, Jeffrey is seen inside Franco's car, and they both shoot each other when Franco takes a seat in his car. Franco is killed, and Jeffrey is shot in the abdomen. As Chris makes a Triple 9 call, Jeffrey calmly pulls a joint and smokes it. Jeffrey's fate is left unknown.

Cook's script was included in Black List scripts of 2010. Hillcoat confirmed his direction of the film later in May 2012; the casting of LaBeouf and Nick Cave scoring the music for the film were also confirmed. Later, Cave left the project and Atticus Ross came on board to compose the score for the film. In February 2014 Open Road Films acquired the US distribution rights to the film and Worldview Entertainment came on board to finance the film after the exit of Panorama Media. Casting The film went through many casting changes. Shia LaBeouf was initially attached to star in the film but later left the project and was replaced by Charlie Hunnam. In December 2013, Hunnam also left the project and was replaced by Casey Affleck. In August 2013, Cate Blanchett and Christoph Waltz were in talks to join the cast but later dropped out and instead Kate Winslet and Woody Harrelson came on board. Casting completed in March 2014, as Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Gal Gadot, Teresa Palmer, and Clifton Collins Jr. rounded out the cast. Hillcoat talking about filming schedule said that, \\"It's a challenge, arranging everyone's schedules and trying to accomplish something with eight main characters. I've never worked on something quite like this.\\" Filming Principal photography began on May 28, 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia. On June 5, filming took place at St. Regis in Buckhead, Atlanta, with Winslet. Filming took place at Centennial Olympic Park Drive, Atlanta from June 23 to June 25, 2014. In early July, filming moved to Decatur, scenes were shot from July 9‚Äì12, 2014 in the 200 block of Kings Highway. Additionally stretches of Ansley Street and Kings Highway were also be used as establishing shots. Scenes were also shot on White Street, South East of Westview Cemetery, Atlanta. On July 17, 2014, a scene was shot in Atlanta with real paramedics, SWAT officers and police officers along with the principal cast. Due to heavy rain, some scenes remained unfinished while shooting at Centennial Olympic Park, where filming again took place from August 5‚Äì6, 2014. After that, filming was wrapped. Music Atticus Ross composed the music for the film along with his wife Claudia Sarne, brother Leopold Ross and Bobby Krlic. Talking about the music of the film, Ross said that \\"he [Hillcoat] had a particular vision for the music on this movie which was very raw sounding electronics; with bizarrely a saxophone in there. With this film, it was difficult because we were trying to get the story right and one would write the music, but then the scenes would change around and it all becomes redundant. So it was quite a bit of work.\\" A foreboding version of This Little Piggy was featured in the trailer of the film.  Release  On August 27, 2014, Open Road set the film for a nationwide release on September 11, 2015. But on June 10, 2015 it was announced the release date of the film has moved from September 11, 2015 to March 4, 2016. In October 2015, the release date was moved up to February 26, 2016. Promotion The first trailer for the film was released on October 5, 2015. Home media Triple 9 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 31, 2016.  Reception =Box office Triple 9 grossed $12.6 million in North America, and $13.3 million in other territories, for a total gross of $25.9 million, against a production budget of $20 million. In the United States and Canada, pre-release tracking suggested the film would gross $7‚Äì9 million from 2,205 theaters in its opening weekend, trailing fellow newcomer Gods of Egypt ($12‚Äì15 million projection) but similar to Eddie the Eagle. The film made $2.1 million on its first day and $6.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing 6th at the box office. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 53% based on 169 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Triple 9s pulpy potboiler thrills don't quite live up to the ferocious talents of its cast, but the film's efficient, solidly crafted genre fun is often enough to balance its troublesome flaws.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Tom Huddleston of Time Out gave Triple 9 four out of five stars, positively comparing the film to Michael Mann's Heat. Huddleston praised the ensemble cast and concluded that the film is \\"carried off with brashness and momentum by a director who genuinely seems to be having a blast.\\" Variety's Justin Chang was less receptive towards the film's narrative, but applauded its action sequences and wrote that the \\"result is a film that conveys the eerie sense of lying in wait for all its characters, and the paranoia is infectious, with at least two scenes certain to have viewers checking their car backseats upon exiting the theater. In a mixed review, Empire's Ian Freer gave Triple 9 three out of five stars. Freer praised the cast's performance, but criticized the film's screenplay and second half, surmising that \\"the interesting world of the film doesn't get the story it deserves.\\" While praising Anthony Mackie's performance and Nicholas Karakatsanis's cinematography, Indiewires Oliver Lyttelton criticized the film's narrative structure as unsatisfying, suggesting that \\"perhaps there's a longer cut out there‚Ä¶ perhaps that cut led to a film that felt like it was actually about something.\\" Alonso Duralde of TheWrap also panned Triple 9, in particular disapproving of the film's screenplay and third act. Duralde writes: \\"‚Ä¶[Triple 9] somehow managed to collect an impressively A-list cast on its way toward becoming a cop movie that's not just dumb, it's disastrous.\\"  References  External links   * Category:2016 films Category:2016 action thriller films Category:2016 crime thriller films Category:2010s heist films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American police detective films Category:American heist films Category:English-language films Category:Fictional portrayals of the Atlanta Police Department Category:Films about police misconduct Category:Films directed by John Hillcoat Category:Films scored by Atticus Ross Category:Films set in Atlanta Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Open Road Films films Category:Worldview Entertainment films ","title":"Triple 9"},{"id":"41870071","text":"St. Joseph may refer to: *Port St. Joe, Florida, the county seat of Gulf County *St. Joseph, Gulf County, Florida, a former town near Port St. Joe *St. Joseph, Pasco County, Florida, an unincorporated community *St. Joseph, Seminole County, Florida, a former unincorporated community ","title":"St. Joseph, Florida"},{"id":"41870090","text":"Bundaberg North is a suburb of Bundaberg in the Bundaberg Region, Queensland, Australia.

He gained a classics scholarship to King's in December 1914 postponed his further education to serve with the Rifle Brigade during World War I. By 1919 he was a captain commanding the drill unit of the Central School of Instruction at Berkhamsted.
