Description Eucalyptus cullenii is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has thick, rough, dark grey or black, deeply and widely furrowed ironbark on its trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull, linear to narrow lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, the same dull green or greyish green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to spherical or pear-shaped, green to yellow, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from January to May and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody hemispherical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with the valves close to rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus cullenii was first formally described in 1920 by Richard Hind Cambage from a specimen collected at Almaden in 1913. The specific epithet (cullenii) honours William Portus Cullen, a barrister and later Chief Justice of New South Wales. Distribution and habitat Cullen's ironbark grows in red podsols and shallow stony soil in hilly or undulating woodland on the northern and eastern parts of the Cape York Peninsula.

Biography  His father was a coppersmith. He displayed artistic talent at an early age and went to Paris to begin his studies at the École des Beaux-arts in 1830. At various times, he worked with Antoine-Jean Gros, Merry-Joseph Blondel and David d'Angers. After several unsuccessful attempts to win the Prix de Rome, he left school. For several years, he was a regular participant in the Salon and received good critical notices. Despite this he returned to his hometown and got married. Once established there, he produced works in a variety of genres, religious and secular, including over 200 portraits. Among his notable patrons was the Delzons family; descendants of Alexis Joseph Delzons, one of Napoleon's generals. After 1845, he began to suffer from gout. As his condition worsened, he gradually gave up painting. He did not, however, become completely inactive. In 1853, he was named the first Director of the \\"Museum of Art and Archaeology of Aurillac\\"; a position he held until his death. At present, only an estimated 10% of his known works have been accounted for; consisting largely of landscapes, genre scenes and portraits of prominent local people; nobility, bourgeoisie and politicians. Most of his identified works are in the Museum. Some are in private collections, and it is believed that is where the bulk of his unfound ones are located. A street in Aurillac has been named after him. A major retrospective of his works was held at the museum in Aurillac in 2012.  Sources  *Oriane Hébert, Eloy Chapsal (1811-1882).

Gray (c. 1847 – January 8, 1893) was an American educator from the U.S. state of Virginia. Biography Sarah A. Gray was born in Alexandria, Virginia to parents William and Laura Dundas Gray. As her father was free and her mother was emancipated, she was able to attend St. Francis School in Baltimore (an opportunity which was not afforded to most African Americans at the time, under slavery). She began teaching at age 14. As the Civil War progressed, many former slaves fled to Alexandria. To address the educational needs of their children, Gray and colleague Jane A. Crouch founded the St. Rose Institute, which remained open throughout the war. Gray established the Excelsior School in 1867, and became a teacher at Alexandria's first public school for black girls, Hallowell School, in 1870. She was named Hallowell's principal in 1883. During her tenure, she traveled to Northern states to study new educational methods and added high school classes to Hallowell's curriculum. She retired in 1892 for health reasons, and died in 1893. Honors In 1920, Hallowell School for Girls was consolidated with Snowden School for Boys. The combined institution was named Parker-Gray School, in honor of Sarah A. Gray and fellow African American educator John F. Parker. After this closed, a new Parker-Gray High School was established in 1950. This remained open until 1965, when all Alexandria schools were integrated. In 1983, T. C. Williams High School's stadium was renamed Parker-Gray Memorial Stadium. The original school also lent its name to the surrounding neighborhood. In 2016, Sarah A. Gray was honored by the Library of Virginia's Virginia Women in History program.

Mead and Deakin Ltd had started in business making cycle and motor cycle components. They also made the \\"Canoelet\\" sidecar. In 1912 they made at least two cyclecars under the name of Medea with 1244cc Chapuis-Dornier engines but these did not go into series production. In 1921 they decided to return to car making and created a subsidiary company called the Rhode Motor Co with a factory at Blythswood Road, Tyseley, Birmingham. The name was taken from Cecil Rhodes. In 1926 it was claimed that 50 cars a week were being made. In 1928 the company was taken over by Thomas McKenzie and H. B. Denley who had been in charge of sales. Production was moved to smaller premises at Hall Green, Birmingham. No engine making facilities existed and the last few cars had Meadows engines. The last cars were made in 1930 or possibly 1931 but were still listed until 1935. Rhode 9.5 The \\"9.5\\" was unusual in having a four-cylinder engine with overhead camshaft. With a capacity of 1087 cc and made in-house, drive was to the rear wheels through a three speed transmission and at first no differential. The engine had no oil pump with lubrication relying on oil being picked up by the flywheel and being fed by a gallery to the valve gear. The conventional chassis had quarter elliptic springs all round. Braking was by either a transmission brake or a single drum on the solid rear axle. The original coachwork was described as the \\"Occasional four\\" indicating that there was just room to squeeze in two rear seat passengers. The de-luxe \\"Norwood\\" tourer model was added in 1923. A Sports version was added in 1923 with a two-seater body with the spare wheel at the rear. The aluminium wings and bonnet were usually left unpainted. The engine was tuned with a high lift camshaft, special cylinder head and fully counterbalanced crankshaft. Options included an electric starter and a differential. A top speed of 65 mph (105 km/hour) and fuel consumption of 45–50 miles per gallon (6.2 to 5.6 L/100 km) was claimed. About 1000 cars are thought to have been made. Rhode 10.8, 11 and 11/30 In 1923 the engine was enlarged to 1223 cc by increasing the cylinder bore from 62 to 66mm and the model name changed to the \\"10.8\\". A choice of coachwork with \\"light four seater\\", coupe and \\"enclosed four seater\\" versions were initially available joined by the \\"All-weather\\" in 1924. The cheapest version took the \\"11\\" name.The sports version now had an output of . In 1925 the Wrigley gearbox was replaced by one of their own manufacture with four speeds and the name changed to the \\"11/30\\". Four wheel brakes were also made available. The engine changed from overhead cam to pushrod overhead valves in 1926 and the name reverted to the \\"10.8\\". 1500 \\"10.8\\"s, \\"11\\"s and \\"11/30\\"s are thought to have been made. Rhode Hawk The final model was the Hawk launched in 1928. The engine reverted to overhead cam and the chassis was lengthened. The only body seems to have been a four-door fabric saloon.

According to the Jain chronicles, he was the son and successor of Yashovarman.  Jain account  The Jain chronicle Bappabhatti-Suri-Charita states Yashovarman's chief queen Suyasha gave birth to Āma during her exile at Ramasainya. Also called Yashodevi, the queen was exiled because of a conspiracy by another queen. Āma was brought up by the Jain monk Siddhasena at Modherakapura, but he and his mother were later restored to their royal positions. As a prince, Āma was a spendthrift, so Yashovarman asked him to be frugal. This annoyed Āma, who returned to Modherakapura. According to the Prabandha Kosha, when Yashovarman fell ill towards the end of his life, he recalled Āma to Kannauj and appointed him as the new king. The Prabhavaka Charita and Prabandha Kosha suggest that Āma ascended the throne during 749-753 CE (807-811 VS). According to Prabhavaka- Charita, Āma once caught a cobra (naga) with a radiant jewel on its head. Because of this, the Jain monk Bappabhatti gave him the title \\"Nagavaloka\\". Āma subdued the kings Samudrasena of Rajagriha (Magadha) and Dharma of Gauda. According to Prabandha Kosha, the poet Vakpati composed Madra-Mahi-Vijaya (\\"the conquest of Madra\\") during his reign; Prabhavaka Charita calls the text Madhu-Matha-Vijaya instead. Āma lost control of Kannauj, and moved to Gopagiri (modern Gwalior). He was inclined towards Jainism. The Prabandha Kosha states that he built a shrine of Mahavira in Gopagiri (modern Gwalior). Under Jain influence, he abdicated the throne in favour of his son Dunduka. He retired to Magadha-tirtha, where he died in 832-833 CE (890 VS). Dunduka was killed by his son Bhoja. There is no information about Bhoja's successors.  Skanda Purana account  According to the Skanda Purana, Āma was a powerful king of Kanyakubja (Kannauj). During his reign, the Vaishnavites of his kingdom converted to Buddhism under the influence of a Buddhist monk, but re-converted to Vaishnavism sometime later. He had a daughter named Ratnaganga, who married his former feudatory Kumarapala. Kumarapala originally ruled in the Punjab region, but later became the ruler of Moharapura.  Historicity  The Jain chroniclers' claim that Āma was the son and successor of Yashovarman seems to be historically accurate. No other king is known to have ruled at Kannauj in mid-8th century CE, until the advent of the Ayudha dynasty in the last quarter of that century. The Jain accounts of Āma's subjugation of Samudrasena and Dharma contain mythical elements, but appear to be based on historical events. These two regions were part of Yashovarman's territory, and their rulers may have declared independence following Yashovarman's defeat against Lalitaditya Muktapida, or following his death. The identity of Samudrasena is not certain. Some historians have identified Dharma with the Pala king Dharmapala, although Dharmapala conquered Kannauj during the reign of the later Ayudha kings. According to historian Shyam Manohar Mishra, Āma probably defeated Dharmapala before the Palas became powerful, but ultimately, Dharmapala emerged victorious. According to D. C. Sircar, Āma probably fought with an earlier Pala king, whom the Jain chroniclers may have confused with Dharmapala. According to Vakpati himself, he composed Madhu-Matha-Vijaya before he wrote Gaudavaho during Yashovarman's reign. Thus, the Prabhavaka Charita claim of Madhu-Matha-Vijaya having been composed during Āma's reign is historically inaccurate. The correct name of the text composed during Āma's reign appears to be Madra-Mahi-Vijaya (\\"victory over Madra region\\"). The name suggests that Āma conquered the Madra region, which Lalitaditya is also said to have conquered. Shyam Manohar Mishra theorizes that Lalitaditya's successors may have lost the area to Āma, until Jayapida recaptured it. Mishra interprets Āma's association with Gopagiri or Gopalagiri (Gwalior) during the last years of his reign as follows: Āma lost control of his kingdom during the Tripartite Struggle for his capital Kannauj between the Palas, the Pratiharas and the Rashtrakutas. As a result, he had to move to Gwalior, where he probably ruled as a vassal.  Identification with Nagabhata II  The Jain chronicles mention Nagavaloka as an epithet of Āma. Based on the similarity of \\"Nagavaloka\\" to \\"Nagabhata\\", several earlier historians identified Āma with the Pratihara king Nagabhata II. These historians include F. Kielhorn, G. H. Ojha, D. R. Bhandarkar, K. M. Munshi, Dasharatha Sharma and B. N. Puri. This identification is based on the following points: * Both the kings ruled in the first half of the ninth century, and died around 833 CE * Both of them bore the title Nagavaloka. * Both had grandsons named Bhoja * Both were rivals of the king Dharma[pala] of Gauda Shyam Manohar Mishra (1977) disagrees with this theory based on the following arguments: * The Jain chronicles unanimously describe Āma as the son of Yashovarman, while Nagabhata II was the son of Vatsaraja * According to the Jain chronicles, Āma ascended the throne around 750 CE, while Nagabhata II ascended the throne nearly half a century later. * No historical records mention Āma and Nagabhata II as the same person. * The title Nagavaloka was not exclusive to Nagabhata II; other kings (such as Nagabhata I) also bore it * Jain accounts state that Āma patronized the poet Vakpati and the Jain monk Bappabhatti: these two figures are not associated with Nagabhata II * The son and successor of Āma was Dunduka, but the son and successor of Nagabhata II was Ramabhadra * According to the Jain accounts, Āma's grandson Bhoja was an insignificant Jain king who killed his father. On the other hand, Nagabhata's grandson Bhoja was an important king and a Vaishnavite.  Other identifications  In the first half of the 9th century CE, Kannauj was ruled by a family of rulers whose name ended in -ayudha. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar theorized that Vajrayudha and Indrayudha were alternative names of Āma. But this theory is contradicted by the Jain accounts. Historian Buddha Prakash identified Āma with Avantivarman, a king mentioned in an inscription found at Ranod near Gwalior. But there is no concrete evidence to support this theory.

It has an area of . It is the largest protected area in the state. The APA adjoins the Cantão State Park and the Araguaia National Park to the west. It contains the buffer zone of the state park. The boundary with the state park is defined by the Coco River, and the boundary with the national park by the Javaés River. The APA would be included in the planned South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor. Environment The Cantão State Park is one of the most important protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon. The Cantão has great biological diversity, including some species at risk of extinction, and is in a good state of preservation. The park covers the inland delta of the Javaés River, with more than 800 lakes and channels, subject to annual flooding. It holds a complex ecotone with elements of Amazon rainforest, cerrado, pantanal and Atlantic Forest. The APA serves as a buffer zone for the state park. Vegetation in the APA is 12% open rainforest, 8% dense rainforest and 27% savanna contact rainforest. History The Ilha do Bananal / Cantão Environmental Protection Area was created by state law 907 of 20 May 1997. This law also created the co-management council. The management board of the APA is deliberative. The name was altered to the Leandro APA by law 1.013 of 29 October 1998, but subsequent documents continue to call it the Ilha do Bananal / Cantão APA. In 2003 the state governor approved a project to survey organizations in the APA and discuss how they could help improve sustainable development of the APA. The project was cut short before completing its work, but resulted in formation of COAFA, the organization of agricultural families of the APA. In 2004 the state government presented a bill to the legislature to reduce the APA by over 80% to make way for agricultural expansion. The proposal was approved, but a campaign was launched against it by university students, teachers and NGOs. They developed a manifesto that said the APA is a place with hundreds of families, traditional communities and rich biodiversity with many species still unknown to science. In response, the federal court in Tocantins suspended the proposed law. The members of the council took office of 22 April 2008. Management rules related to turtle conservation were issued on 22 July 2008. In December 2013 the management plan was being revised by the Instituto Natureza do Tocantins (Naturatins) with the participation of local rural producers. Economy The objectives are to improve the quality of life of the residents and to protect regional ecosystems. Exploitation and direct economic use of natural resources is allowed, but in a planned and regulated manner. The APA is divided into zones with four types of land use: *Special uses zones (1.27%) are totally modified landscapes containing housing or the urban periphery *Economic development zones (65.10%) are used for agriculture and livestock raising following rational and sustainable practices *Wildlife conservation zones (17.46%) have special environmental conservation needs, with more stringent protective measures and environmental recovery projects where needed. *Wildlife preservation zones (16.22%) have minimal interference with the fauna and flora a little or no human pressure on the environment.

It is one of six known Big Sioux phase villages from the Middle Missouri Tradition that existed between 1100-1250 C.E. The site, located on a terrace overlooking the Big Sioux River, has well- preserved features, including earth lodge and storage pits, and evidence of fortifaction. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010, and as a National Historic Landmark in 2016.. Description Kimball Village is located in northwestern Iowa, in rural Plymouth County. It is set on a terrace set between the Big Sioux River and the Loess Hills. The site is identifiable as a mound rising in the floodplain, and occupies an area of just under . Dr. Charles R. Keyes, a professor at Cornell College in Iowa, his assistant Ellison Orr, and 14 workers from the Works Progress Administration first excavated the site in 1939, after Keyes heard that artifact hunters were finding objects in this area. They discovered houses, hearths, storage pits, burial features, and over 9,000 artifacts. Other excavations have been done in 1942, 1963 and 2009, the latter determining the full extent of the site. These investigations revealed that the village had at least 20 dwellings organized in five rows facing south. It was fortified by a timber palisade and possibly also a ditch. As of its designation as a National Historic Landmark in 2016, the site was described as remarkably well preserved, having suffered little erosion damage. Only 3% of its area had been investigated by archaeologists.

It was designed with outside contract assistance. The glider is now out of production. Design and development The company decided to contract out design work on the glider, rather than establish its own design department, as its limited line of gliders was intended to fill particular market niches, rather than offer a complete line of gliders and this made contract design more cost efficient.Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003-04, page 30. Pagefast Ltd, Lancaster OK, 2003. The aircraft was designed as a beginner and intermediate glider. It was certified as a purely DHV Class 1 glider, from which it takes its name. The four model sizes produced are each named for their relative size. The design is made from high- tenacity, low-porosity material of 49 g/m2 and incorporates diagonal tapes instead of the more commonly used whole diagonal ribs. The tapes form triangles, in conjunction with reinforcement tapes on the bottom surface of the glider wing and prevent airfoil deformation. The wing also is constructed with a trailing edge tape that extends across the complete wing's span. This tape reduces canopy oscillations and stiffens the wing in flight. Small intermediate ribs are also sewn into the wing's trailing edge to improve stability. The wing also has \\"safety cells\\" of line attachment tapes that extend to the wing top surface, reducing the risk of \\"zipper\\" line failures. These design features result in a wing that provides good performance with high stability. Flight testing showed that the wing inflates easily, regardless of wing layout on the ground. Operational history Reviewer Rainer Lodes described the One in a 2000 review as having \\"achieved an optimum synthesis of a nice, co-ordinated handling with a high level of passive safety at the same time. The well balanced handling should satisfy even very demanding pilots: Even small movements on the controls are directly converted by the One without any delay. If you want to turn flat or tight, this glider does not leave any desires unsatisfied. The control forces are progressively rising and can be described as average high ... This canopy shows a convincing safety even when the pilot makes major mistakes like the too fast release of a spiral dive or high wing overs without counter-breaking or even when doing a provoked 50 percent asymmetric deflation and holding the A-risers down without counter-breaking.\\" In evaluating the One, Lodes concluded, \\"the performance data are not far from cross country gliders anymore – combined with excellent handling characteristics and really maximum safety. The One can without a doubt be called a trend setter.\\" Variants ;One S :Small-sized model for lighter pilots. Its span wing has a wing area of , 56 cells and the aspect ratio is 4.8:1.

Before disappearing, he worked as a Royal Air Force Regiment gunner. McKeague was last seen, on town centre CCTV footage, entering a cul-de-sac which contained a number of wheelie bins. His mobile phone was tracked by masts along a route between Bury St Edmunds and a landfill site near Barton Mills. Suffolk Constabulary were initially reluctant to search the site for McKeague's remains because a bin lorry that had travelled that route at that time had been estimated to have been carrying a load of only . In March 2017, however, the police discovered that the lorry had a significantly larger weight; more than . Whilst McKeague's disappearance remains under investigation and the case continues to attract widespread publicity, the belief by authorities, but not the family, is that McKeague was crushed to death by the bin lorry and his remains are at the Barton Mills landfill. Suffolk Constabulary have spent more than £2.1 million investigating McKeague's disappearance, making it one of the most expensive missing persons investigations that the force has conducted and, in the words of Suffolk police, one that has brought unique pressures on the force. The search for McKeague was stood down in March 2018. Life McKeague was born in Perth in September 1993 and was raised in Cupar, Fife, before moving to Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland at the age of nine, following his parents' divorce. McKeague and his two brothers, Darroch and Makeyan, were raised by their mother and attended St Margarets Primary School and St Columba's High School in Dunfermline. McKeague joined the RAF Regiment in 2013 and was posted to No. II Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment based at RAF Honington after his initial Regiment training at the same base. McKeague is a Senior Aircraftman gunner and medic on the squadron. In January 2017, April Oliver, aged 21, announced that she was pregnant with McKeague's baby. Neither she nor McKeague were aware of the pregnancy at the time of his disappearance. They had only been dating for five months. Miss Oliver was on a holiday in the United States when McKeague disappeared, but cut the holiday short to return to the UK. On 18 June 2017, Oliver announced that she had given birth to a daughter, Ellie-Louise, on 11 June 2017. Disappearance Sketch map of Bury St Edmunds town centre where McKeague disappeared, showing position of CCTV cameras On the night of 23 September 2016, McKeague was out drinking with friends in Bury St Edmunds. He had driven himself to the town with the intention of leaving his car overnight. He separated from his friends in the early hours of 24 September, after leaving the Flex nightclub on St Andrews Street South. The doorman at Flex recalls asking McKeague to leave because he was too drunk to stay. He remarked that McKeague was 'no trouble' whatsoever and that they chatted afterwards on the street outside. McKeague was in the Mama Mia's takeaway restaurant, reportedly his usual takeaway restaurant, between 1:15 am and 1:30 am. The last known sighting of McKeague was on CCTV at 3:25 am on Brentgovel Street, walking into the \\"Horseshoe area\\" where there were a number of wheelie bins. There was no footage of him ever emerging. CCTV footage also suggested that McKeague had slept briefly in a doorway before waking up and moving on. It is not believed that he intended to walk back to his base, RAF Honington, which is north east of the town along minor unclassified roads. Nicola Urquhart, his mother, said in a statement dated 3 October 2016, which was released to the public and reported on by Evening Standard, that her son has never walked back to Honington on any previous occasions, and that leaving on his own, getting food and sleeping for a short time were all things McKeague had done in the past. As he had the weekend off, McKeague was not reported missing until the 26 September (the following Monday) when he failed to report for work. Since he was reported missing, the Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue team (SULSAR) have been involved with the police in searching the area around Bury St Edmunds and Honington alongside the RAF's own search and rescue teams which have been bolstered by searches involving police helicopters. There was one unconfirmed sighting of McKeague at the back of a sugar factory at Bury St Edmunds at 4:20 am, but police have stressed this has now been investigated and the person involved is not McKeague. The last known authenticated sighting was on the CCTV at Brentgovel Street. Investigation=Early theories On the morning of McKeague's disappearance, his Nokia Lumia mobile phone had moved from Bury St Edmunds to Barton Mills, some to the north west, along the corridor of the A1101 road. Phone data indicated that this journey took 28 minutes, which meant that it could not have been carried the distance by someone walking on foot. In October, Suffolk Constabulary seized a bin lorry that was said to have contained his mobile but the line of enquiry led to nothing. It was noted that the bin lorry seized was only carrying a weight of and so could not have been carrying McKeague himself as he weighs around . This led to searches being carried out along the lorry's route between the two towns. The mobile phone was either switched off at 8:00 am, ran out of battery power or was damaged and it was not found. One focus of the investigation has been whether or not someone gave a lift to McKeague as he was walking back to his base. His mother stated that Corrie would have accepted a lift if offered to him, as he would offer a lift if he was driving and saw someone walking on their own. She also appealed for anyone who might have given him a lift to come forward, even if something untoward had happened. Police believed that McKeague was not in Bury St Edmunds. Superintendent Katie Elliott stated in an interview to Forces TV with Nicola Urquhart that there could have been third party involvement and that the police would not rule anything out. The investigation also covered parts of the Hollow Road Industrial Estate in Bury St Edmunds and Great Livermere, a small village close to RAF Honington on McKeague's supposed route back to his base. Along with the British Transport Police, the Suffolk Constabulary searched along railway lines in the area and some of the roads were closed to enable thorough searches. In November 2016, a stretch of the eastbound carriageway of the A14 road, was closed between junctions 44 & 45 (Moreton Hall and Rougham) to search for McKeague. On 10 October, a dismembered and burned body was found in a suitcase off the A628 road near Tintwistle in Derbyshire. Initial investigations led police to state that the body was that of a white man under the age of 50. A DNA analysis, however, later proved negative and Derbyshire Constabulary confirmed that the body was not that of McKeague. CCTV evidence and searches In November 2016, it was revealed that in the two hours between 3:00 am and 5:00 am on the morning of 24 September 2016, 39 people could be seen on the same CCTV camera as the last one to record McKeague's last movements. Despite repeated inquiries and appeals, 23 of these people could not be identified. Suffolk Constabulary installed a 'pod' at a Christmas Fair in Bury St Edmunds, between 24 and 25 November 2016 and the public were encouraged to visit the pod to help establish the identities of the 23 people. By 4 December, 13 had been positively identified. In December 2016, of woodland between Barton Mills and RAF Honington was searched by volunteers and staff from the Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue Team. The search area, previously not examined, centred on the King's Forest area, with the possibility that McKeague had been hit by a vehicle on his way home. The area was declared officially cleared by the end of 17 December. Urquhart said that she had prepared herself mentally for finding her son's body. Urquhart statement and mobile phone In December 2016, Urquhart publicly went on record as saying that Suffolk Constabulary were not properly investigating her son's disappearance. The appeal fund raised in Corrie's name had attracted funds of more than £50,000 by the end of December 2016 and Urquhart was considering hiring a private investigator to pursue lines of enquiry which she believed the police had failed to follow. Suffolk Constabulary defended their actions stating \\"We are very focused on finding Corrie. Although it is a missing persons inquiry, we have given it the same resources as a major investigation. We have not ruled out any possibility.\\" Urquhart postponed hiring an investigator after Suffolk Constabulary agreed to investigate an incident where three men had been seen, on 25 September, setting fire to a car. The police later said that there was no link between the car fire and McKeague's disappearance. In the same interview, Urquhart described her son as a \\"social hand grenade\\" and that he would have been happy to get into a stranger's car. In January 2017, the back of a mobile phone was found close to where the last signal from McKeague's phone was detected. However, as the part contained \\"no essential components\\", such as a SIM card or any electronic parts, the police said it would be impossible to link it with the disappearance and that no further analysis would be performed. However, police announced they were examining McKeague's activities on swinger websites. His family had provided Suffolk Constabulary with his username for at least one site. Landfill search In February 2017, police started searching the landfill previously identified as being the last place his mobile phone was located when it connected to a tower. This was in the belief that McKeague had slept in a bin in the Horseshoe area and had been crushed to death when the bin lorry collected the contents of the bin and transported them to the landfill site. Whilst Suffolk Police stated that McKeague had gone and slept in a bin in the Horseshoe area, his family said that they did not believe this version of events. They point to the fact that he was proud of his appearance and if necessary, he could have gone and slept in his car which was not very far away. The search was planned to cover to a depth of and was expected to take ten weeks. On 13 February, McKeague's mother announced that a £50,000 reward, offered for information about her son, was to be withdrawn if nobody came forward in the following week. By May 2017, it was revealed that search had cost Suffolk Police £1 million and that it might take longer than the estimated 10 weeks. This makes the case one of the most expensive missing person enquiries that the Suffolk Police have ever dealt with. By May, they had sifted through of waste. On 1 March, a 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice. He was not the driver of the bin lorry nor a relative of McKeague. On 7 March, the suspect was released and the police stated that they believed he had genuinely made a mistake and that the charge had been dropped. In conjunction with this, police revealed that an error had been made in the calculations of the weight of the bin lorry and that it was close to . Urquhart stated on Facebook that \\"This can really, devastatingly, only mean one thing\\". On 5 June, it was announced that police were finding \\"items from the right time\\" and place of McKeague's disappearance. About 4,430 tonnes of waste had been searched, but a police spokeswoman said: \\"The work is constantly being reviewed and, as the search team are still finding items from the right time frame that are identifiable as coming from the town, the search will continue on a week by week basis.\\". On 21 July 2017, 20 weeks into the landfill search, Detective Superintendent Katie Elliott, of Suffolk Constabulary, announced at a press conference, that the search of the landfill had come to an end with no positive results on McKeague. A human skull was found at the site in April 2017, but was found to be from a female and dated back to before 1945. Police managed to trace the person who had sent it to landfill and they deemed there to be no suspicious circumstances. Between February and July, the police had sifted through of waste at the landfill site. The search will now focus on incinerated waste and the police will also initiate a comprehensive review of the investigation. Nicola Urquhart also publicly acknowledged the possibility that McKeague may never be found but has criticised the police's decision to hand the landfill site back to the owners and sought an injunction to prevent the area where his remains are believed to be from being disturbed. Police were criticized for not continuing the search as they had stated that it was not about the money being spent on the landfill dig. A former police officer stated that if it was not about the money, then there was no reason to not go searching. Dr. Stuart Hamilton, a forensic pathologist, stated that if McKeague's body had been in the bin lorry and it was crushed, then the rate of decomposition would have been faster than normal for a human body. With the amount of waste on the site cross-contamination from other human DNA was also a strong possibility. In August 2017, it was revealed that police were also sifting through \\"incinerated material\\" that was transferred from the landfill site. Occasionally, waste from the landfill is taken to Red Lodge transfer station and then on to an incinerator at Great Blakenham near Ipswich. Bones that had been found at the incinerator were being investigated, although police said it was more likely that McKeague's body was still at the landfill site. This supposition was later confirmed in the same month when the police announced that the bones were not human. Also in August 2017, the family reinstated the £50,000 reward for information. The money was donated by a local businessperson earlier in the investigation, but had been withdrawn when the police started searching the landfill site. Release of CCTV images On 21 September 2017, Suffolk Police released four CCTV images of people who they said could have been witnesses to McKeague's disappearance twelve months previously. They also set up a 'pod' in Bury St Edmunds town centre to appeal for information and hopefully engender new lines of enquiry. Second landfill search In October 2017, Suffolk Police announced another search would be started at the landfill site at Milton in Cambridgeshire. This search would focus on an area adjacent to the previous search area, but believed to contain waste taken to the site around the time that McKeague disappeared. A review of the investigation into McKeague's disappearance by a specialist police unit based in the East Midlands, supports Suffolk Police's theory that McKeague climbed into a bin in the Horseshoe area of Bury St Edmunds and was brought by a bin truck to the landfill site at Milton. Despite this, the police have intimated that the search for McKeague at the landfill site will be wound down by Christmas 2017. Suffolk Police announced on 26 March 2018 that the search for the missing airman would be stood down as there were \\"no realistic lines of enquiry left\\". The Suffolk Police Federation noting that the investigation had brought \\"unique pressures\\" to the force. The day after the Suffolk Police's winding down of the case, McKeague's mother and brothers appeared on the Victoria Derbyshire show to highlight what they cite as \\"inconsistencies\\" with the raw data referring to the weight carried in the bin lorry. Mckeague's mother stated that either the data was manipulated or \\"someone is lying to police\\". In April 2018, Corrie McKeague's father, Martin, acknowledged that his son was probably dead and that he hoped to hold a memorial service in the summer of 2018 to \\"help him and loved ones gain some closure following the police’s decision [to stop searching the landfill site and wind down the investigation].\\" Some people, including McKeague's father in an interview with the UK tabloid Daily Mirror, had suggested the possibility that Corrie McKeague had killed himself because of the pressures of fatherhood. This was refuted by the rest of the family who explained that the first text notifying McKeague that April Oliver was pregnant did not get sent to his phone until after he had disappeared. His father later released a statement on social media that said McKeague was in the Suffolk waste disposal system somewhere but that \\"his remains are essentially irretrievable.\\" Martin McKeague acknowledged that his son was prone to sleeping in and on top of bins and that he was in the bin that the bin truck delivered to the waste site on the morning of 24 September 2016. At the same time, McKeague's mother stated that she would continue to look for answers citing the fact that the coroner had not issued a death certificate as he was still presumed missing rather than presumed dead. Theories A retired senior Metropolitan Police detective, Colin Sutton, went on record stating that McKeague's disappearance had not been intentional, as making preparations always leaves a digital footprint. Sutton also said that McKeague was shown walking into a cul-de-sac that was blocked off by a high wall and a fence and that there was no CCTV of him leaving it. He doubted whether McKeague would have been aware of where the CCTV cameras were located which, Sutton said, was also indicative of not leaving intentionally. The CCTV cameras, operated by the town council, did not provide 100% coverage. Even after a review of privately operated CCTV recordings, there were no further sightings of McKeague. McKeague's uncle, Tony Wringe, said that the area off Brentgovel Street that McKeague was shown walking into on CCTV, had been physically tested and it was shown to be impossible for him not to have been recorded on CCTV if he had left on foot. Sutton said that his guess was that there was another person, or other people, involved in McKeague's disappearance. McKeague's job with the RAF was not a contributory factor, according to the lead detective in the investigation. Intended disappearance was also put in doubt by McKeague's happy mood at the time; he was making plans to meet up with his brother, Darroch, on the night that he went missing, with his last text being sent at 03:08 am. He had also booked flights to go home to Dunfermline for Halloween. His mother also pointed out that he loved his dog which he kept at RAF Honington and would not have left it behind intentionally. She has stated that there were three possible scenarios: that he met with an accident and was dead, that he left voluntarily or that a third party was involved. In December 2016, it was revealed that McKeague's bank and social media accounts had not been touched after his disappearance.https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2016-12-29/facebook- video-appeal-by-mother-of-missing-corrie-mckeague/ Although not openly discussed, some parallels have been drawn between the proximity ( away) of McKeague's disappearance to an attempted kidnapping of a serviceman at RAF Marham in July 2016. Whilst kidnapping was one route for the investigation, McKeague's mother, who is a family liaison officer with Police Scotland, said that it was not something that the police were discussing with her. In December 2016, the outgoing Station Commander of RAF Honington, Group Captain Mick Smeath ruled out any link between the attempted abduction at RAF Marham and the disappearance of McKeague. In November 2016, the family issued a statement on Facebook saying that they were unhappy with the police investigation. McKeague's uncle, Tony Wringe, said that \\"This is a Major Investigation Team in name not function\\". The family also said that a decision not to search a landfill in the Barton Mills area for McKeague's phone had been wrong. After the police stopped the landfill search in July 2017, Nicola Urquhart went on record to say that she did not agree with the version of events being put forward by Suffolk Police. They maintain that McKeague slept in a bin, which was then emptied into the truck and he was crushed and then either buried at the landfill or incinerated at Great Blakenham. Nicola Urquhart points out that Corrie had been asleep in the doorway of a shop in Brentgovel Street for nearly two hours. She finds it hard to believe that he would then go and sleep in the bin; she maintains that a third party was involved. She also disputed the evidence about the bin load, which the police had said was an unusual , by stating that loads over were not out of the ordinary for that route from the Horseshoe area in Bury St. Edmunds. At the same time, in August 2018, she also maintained that it may have been possible for McKeague to have left the Horseshoe area without being detected by CCTV, when a pivotal part of the enquiry had focused on the belief that it was impossible to have not detected McKeague on CCTV if he had left the area on foot. As the two year anniversary of McKeague's disappearance approached, Nichola Urquhart revealed that the police only had CCTV footage on the Saturday morning up until 12:00 pm. She states that McKeague could have got up from sleeping in the Horseshoe area and left anytime after the CCTV footage stops. As the 28 day period for retaining CCTV imagery has passed, there is no way of ascertaining if McKeague does leave the area later in the day. In a Facebook post in November 2018, Nichola Urquhart states that on her last meeting with Suffolk Police, she was shown some CCTV footage of people going in and out of the Horseshoe area on the morning that McKeague disappeared. All the people in the footage were wearing dark clothes apart from one individual who is seen leaving the area wearing light coloured trousers, the same colour that McKeague was wearing on the night in question. Urquhart acknowledged that it was possible that McKeague left and is now AWOL. However she also stated that she has never believed this is probable, Corrie made no plans, had no reason and has never been seen after the immediate sightings. In October 2018, Suffolk Police revealed that they had analysed the data for the bin weights as carried from the Horseshoe area to the landfill site at Milton and it was normally between and during the period shown as January 2016 to February 2017. It was only nearly once in that entire time; therefore, on the morning of the 24 September 2016, when the load was registered as , it was determined that McKeague was inside the bin that had been emptied. The police stated that they believed McKeague's remains to be somewhere in the landfill tip at Milton. Police costs By December 2017, Suffolk Police revealed that the inquiry had cost more than £1.2 million , more than of earth and waste had been sorted in the second search at the landfill and that they had assessed over 2,000 hours of CCTV imagery. By January 2018, the total cost of the search was £2.1 million; with Suffolk Police having an annual budget of £122 million. The search for McKeague, officially known as Operation Phonetic, was revealed to have been the most expensive Suffolk Police operation in the ten years between 2009 and 2019. Peter Aldous, the Conservative MP for the Waveney Constituency, petitioned Parliament in February 2018 to back a proposal to refund the Suffolk Constabulary for their costs in the Corrie McKeague disappearance. Effectively, this would mean the Home Office 'reimbursing' the police with £2.15 million to cover the amount spent in searching for McKeague.

Annual figures reported by the theatre include 20 new productions, 1,100 performances, and 350,000 spectators. The theatre has 250 permanent members of staff, and operates across 6 stages. History The theatre has its roots in two organizations: Helsingin Työväenteatteri (\\"Workers' Theatre of Helsinki\\", established in 1902) and Helsingin Kansanteatteri (People's Theatre of Helsinki, established in 1934). These two merged in 1948 to form Helsingin Kansanteatteri- Työväenteatteri (\\"People's and Workers' Theatre of Helsinki\\"), which eventually transitioned into the Helsinki City Theatre in 1964. The rebranding was largely a result of the emergence of the Helsinki Theatre Foundation, who owns the theatre, and whose members are elected by the City Council of Helsinki. Prior to 1965, the Helsinki City Theatre operated on third-party stages, after which the organization chose to construct a theatre building of their own. They held an architectural competition for the design of the new building, which was won by Timo Penttilä. The building designed by Penttilä opened in 1967. In 1989, an annex building was constructed, which was also designed by Penttilä's architectural firm.

The diameter of a set by definition is the least upper bound of the distances between all pairs of points in the set. A shape covers a set if it contains a congruent subset. In other words the set may be rotated, translated or reflected to fit inside the shape. The problem was posed by Henri Lebesgue in a letter to Gyula Pál in 1914. It was published in a paper by Pál in 1920 along with Pál's analysis. He showed that a cover for all curves of constant width one is also a cover for all sets of diameter one and that a cover can be constructed by taking a regular hexagon with an inscribed circle of diameter one and removing two corners from the hexagon to give a cover of area 2 - \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\approx 0.84529946 . The shape outlined in black is Pál's solution to Lebesgue's universal covering problem. Within it, planar shapes with diameter one have been included: a circle (in blue), a Reuleaux triangle (in red) and a square (in green). Known bounds In 1936 Roland Sprague showed that a part of Pál's cover could be removed near one of the other corners while still retaining its property as a cover. This reduced the upper bound on the area to a \\\\le 0.844137708436. In 1992 Hansen showed that two more very small regions of Sprague's solution could be removed bringing the upper bound down to a \\\\le 0.844137708398. Hansen's construction was the first to make use of the freedom to use reflections. In 2015 John Baez, Karine Bagdasaryan and Philip Gibbs showed that if the corners removed in Pál's cover are cut off at a different angle then it is possible to reduce the area further giving an upper bound of a \\\\le 0.8441153. In October 2018 Philip Gibbs published a paper on arXiv using high-school geometry and claiming a further reduction to 0.8440935944. The best known lower bound for the area was provided by Peter Brass and Mehrbod Sharifi using a combination of three shapes in optimal alignment giving a \\\\ge 0.832.

The company manufactures testing and monitoring equipment for networks. It also develops optical technology used for a range of applications including material quality control, currency anti- counterfeiting and 3D motion sensing, including Microsoft's Kinect video game controller. The company was spun off from JDSU when the company divided itself up in August 2015. History=As JDSU VIAVI Solutions' history dates back to 1979 when Uniphase was started in a San Jose, California garage, as a manufacturer of lasers for chip makers and scanners. Through mergers and acquisitions, the company eventually became known as JDS Uniphase, or simply JDSU. In August 2015, JDSU split into two new independent companies: VIAVI Solutions and Lumentum Holdings, which was JDSU's former Communications and Commercial Optical products division. Post-JDSU In August 2015, after the JDSU split, former CEO Tom Waechter stepped down and VIAVI Solutions appointed Richard Belluzzo as interim president and CEO. In September 2015, the company announced the release of GigaStor Software Edition, software designed to capture packet data from software-defined networking (SDN) platforms, for purposes of performance and forensic analysis. In February 2016, Belluzzo became Chairman and Oleg Khaykin became president and CEO. The same month, the company announced that Frontier Communications had selected VIAVI's Ethernet Assurance Solution (EtherASSURE) for help with network performance management, troubleshooting and service level agreement (SLA) management. Also in February 2016, VIAVI Solutions added functionality to its CellAdvisor Base Station Analyzer to allow baseband testing during tower installation, in order to reduce the number of tower climbs and improve safety. The company also announced the GEOson network automation and management tool for 4G and 5G network testing, developed with technology from earlier acquisitions of networking companies Reverb Networks and Arieso. In March 2016, the company announced it had added a fully DOCSIS 3.1 (D3.1)-compliant signal meter to its OneExpert CATV Signal Analysis Meter, allowing service providers to test D3.1 signals in the field. Also in March 2016, the company announced MicroNIR near infrared spectrometer tools that allow quality control managers to inspect organic materials in the field. In July 2016, the company partnered with fellow networking vendor Brocade to use Brocade's Packet Broker and Session Director tools to capture and send subscriber traffic to VIAVI’s xSIGHT Targeted Subscriber Search (TSS) for analysis.  Products = Network Enablement (NE)  The Network Enablement segment develops testing products for broadband/IP network operators to build and maintain their networks. The products are used in lab and production environments as well as in the field. NE products are divided into wireline, wireless and lab groups. The company also produces the StrataSync cloud management platform for remote data collection and management for its equipment. VIAVI's wireline NE group consists of performance monitoring; Ethernet service assurance; and video analytics and assurance products. The company produces compact optical network field testers under the brand name T-BERD in the US, and MTS in Europe. The devices support network rates up to 100G. The company produces the OneExpert line of handheld signal meters which are used to install and troubleshoot cable service (OneExpert CATV) up to DOCSIS 3.1 (D3.1) and telco service (OneExpert xDSL) up to G.fast. The wireless NE group includes CellAdvisor, a portable tester for testing radio frequency (RF) signals over fiber. It allows baseband testing during cell tower installation, in order to reduce the number of tower climbs and improve safety. Lab testing equipment in the NE group includes the Optical Network Tester (ONT) product family, which is designed for testing multi- protocol and multi-rate services, for optical network elements designed to carry 100G, 400G and other high-speed optical network technologies. The group also produces the Xgig 1000, a lab-based tester for iSCSI and Fibre Channel protocols used with Storage Area Networks. Service Enablement (SE)  The SE segment provides systems and services for broadband/IP network operators and data centers. EtherASSURE is Ethernet equipment for testing physical and virtual networks. xSIGHT is a customer service tool for mobile operators, for scaling and monitoring wireless technologies such as 4G. The GEOson network automation and management tool automates management of 4G and 5G networks by combining machine learning and geolocation data. The Observer family of service enablement products includes Observer Gigastor, a packet capture and analysis tool for enterprises, and Observer SightOps, a tool for cloud and on- premises monitoring. The Observer Gigastor product came from VIAVI's-predecessor JDSU's 2013 acquisition of Network Instruments, and the Observer Sightops product came from a partnership with network monitoring company ScienceLogic.  Optical Security and Performance Products (OSP)  The OSP segment utilizes optical coating technology for anti-counterfeiting products, and other optics. The anti-counterfeiting products are Optically Variable Pigment (OVP) and the newer Optically Variable Magnetic Pigment (OVMP), colors used in modern currency to create color shifting effects. The group also supports anti-counterfeiting efforts by producing hard to copy labels for pharmaceutical and consumer-electronics products. The group's ChromaFlair color-shifting paint is used by automobile manufacturers. The group's optical thin-film coating technology is used for light sensors; 3D sensors, used with Microsoft's Kinect video game platform; wafer level patterning; linear variable filters, and for coating large scale optics. The group also manufactures MicroNIR Spectrometers that are used in the field for real-time, non-destructive chemical and physical analysis of materials and monitoring of processes. The group's optical products for aerospace and defense include optics for guidance systems, laser eye protection and signature management.

History City hall of Praia Praia was founded as a small village near the natural harbour in the early 16th century. Due to its strategic position on a plateau it was easily defended against pirate attacks, which gave it a large advantage over the older city of Ribeira Grande (Cidade Velha). It gradually superseded Cidade Velha to become the most important settlement of Cape Verde, and became the seat of the colonial government in 1770. In the course of the 19th century, the Plateau was completely redeveloped with streets according to a grid plan, lined with grand colonial buildings and mansions.Antigas residências senhoriais do Centro Histórico da Praia, Domingas Andrade Silva Barbosa de Pina, Universidade de Cabo Verde, 2009 Since 2016, the historic centre of Praia is on the tentative list of World Heritage sites.Centre historique de Praia, UNESCO Nossa Senhora da Graça (Our Lady of Graces) cathedral Cityscape Quartel Jaime Mota The streets of Plateau are laid out according to a grid plan.

Stone was stabbed by a 28-year- old California man, James Tran. The event received considerable attention in the U.S., in part because Stone had helped stop a gunman on a Paris-bound train traveling from Amsterdam via Brussels two months earlier in August 2015.  Background  Stone in 2015. Two months prior to the initial confrontation, Spencer Stone, a then-United States Air Force senior airman, along with his friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler, stopped a gunman on a Paris-bound train travelling from Amsterdam via Brussels in August 2015. Stone was serving at the United States Air Force 65th Air Base Group at the time of the event. A 25-year-old Moroccan man, believed to be Ayoub El-Khazzani, was in train car No. 12, armed with an AKM assault rifle and equipped with 270 rounds of ammunition. After being instructed by Skarlatos, Stone tackled the armed suspect, and was stabbed in the neck and eyebrow and almost lost his thumb. The event and its aftermath received attention in the U.S. and abroad, with Stone gaining international attention and recognized by U.S. Ambassador to France Jane D. Hartley for \\"his actions in saving countless lives\\", U.S. President Barack Obama, with a ceremony held at The Pentagon to honor Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler. Stone was honored with the Airman's Medal and a Purple Heart, among other decorations and awards.  Incident  During the dawn of October 8, 2015, Spencer Stone along with one male and three female friends, were exploring nightlife activities in downtown Sacramento. Shortly after visiting the Badlands Dance Club, Stone's group was near 21st and K streets when a member of a group, among them including James Tran, used a cell phone to take video of women in Stone's group. \\"There was a dispute that led to the altercation,\\" Deputy Police Chief Ken Bernard said. There was a verbal argument which subsided and both groups began going on their separate ways. Tran, however, then engaged Stone again, and, \\"it escalated from there into a physical fight,\\" Sacramento Police Chief Sam Somers Jr. stated. At around 12:45 am, Tran then circled behind Stone and stabbed him multiple times in the back and torso with a knife that had been concealed on Tran's person. After the stabbing, Tran and his group fled the scene in a 2009-2012 dark Toyota Camry. A woman who was with Stone was also involved in the altercation, according to eye witness taxi driver Kennedy Hailemariam who pulled up to the intersection where the fight took place. \\"She tried to protect him too, but she got hit too,\\" Hailemariam said to CBS-13. \\"Like you know, big punch, like boom.\\" Stone's companions and bystanders summoned emergency services. First responders recognized the seriousness of Stone's injuries, and rushed him to University of California Davis Medical Center (UCDMC). On arrival, medical staff determined that Stone had sustained multiple life-threatening injuries, and underwent emergency open heart surgery to repair wounds to his lungs, liver, and heart. Stone recovered, and was released from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives were assigned to the case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of the assailant, and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime did not appear to be a retaliatory strike by a terrorist organization (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated at the time of the assault.  Trial  Tran made his first appearance in Sacramento County Superior Court on November 6, 2015, charged of the attempted murder of Stone with an allegation of using a dangerous weapon, a knife. He did not enter a plea, was ordered to be held without bail, and was scheduled to return to court December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, Tran again appeared in the Sacramento Superior Court for a bail review hearing. This was subsequently postponed, with Tran held without bail. On January 7, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another preliminary hearing was set for February 26, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if the defendant is found guilty. Judge Goodman ordered another hearing to be held on March 30, 2016, to determine whether or not prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with the charges against Tran. Tran plead guilty and on May 12, 2017 was sentenced to nine years in state prison. He is currently incarcerated at Folsom State Prison with a scheduled release date of December 2021. That could be sooner with good time credit, or later, if he was to be found guilty of behavioral problems while incarcerated.CDCR inmate locator, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

Skæring Hede was originally a large heath but today only a fraction of it remains as encroaching suburbs and areas with summer houses have gradually taken over much of the natural land in the area, through the 70s and 80s. The remaining area of are mainly forest, although some heath do remain, and is managed as a public forest park by Aarhus Municipality. Today Skæring Hede is one of only a few public forests in Skæring and the northernmost park in Aarhus. The forest is mainly mixed pine and birch forest with a number of walking paths crossing through it and it is home to a World War II memorial. Skæring Hede is well known as the place where five Danish resistance fighters were executed during the Second World War in one of the first mass executions during the war. Parking facilities on Åstrup Strandvej. The forest has a Grejbase (Equipment base), an equipment locker which can be rented by teachers and other educators on excursions. The base in Skæring Hede is focused on marine biology due to the proximity to the coast and shallow, rocky beach. The forest today is a recreational space in Skæring and an important local landmark. History The heath at Skæring was a relatively remote and unused area up to the 1940s when it was still some 10–15 km. outside the city. When the German army occupied Denmark it also eventually took possession of the heath and by 1943 had turned it into a shooting range. On 17 November 1943 the Danish resistance blew up 3 bridges at Langå, severing the railroad between Aarhus and Randers. The resistance group was commanded by Kai Hannibal Hoff and consisted of Jørgen Røjel, Ejvind Jacobsen, Ole Hovedskov, Sven Johannesen and Oluf Kroer. The operation was a success, for a month German rail-borne troop transports from Norway had to be stopped or redirected. However, the Gestapo quickly started tracking down the resistance members and 4 men from Randers were arrested while Jørgen Røjel and Ejvind Jacobsen managed to escape and eventually made it to neutral Sweden. Kai Hannibal Hoff, the leader of the operation, was arrested on 30 November and moved to Randers Barracks where he was killed trying to escape. Seven people were arrested in all, 5 were sentenced to death and two were given life in prison. On 2 December 1943 early in the morning in Skæring Hede, the five death sentences were carried out by shooting. The bodies of the five executed men and the body of another resistance fighter were subsequently buried in secret at Husbjerg Klit, a remote military training ground in south-west Jutland. The memorial on Skæring Hede has a connection to another Danish World War II memorial in Allerstrupgård Skov. It is located at the meadow codenamed \\"Mustard Point\\" where the Hvidsten Group received supplies from the Allies during the war. The 8 members of the group were arrested March 1944 and executed 9 June 1944 in Ryvangen. After the war the bodies were exhumed and brought back to the village Hvidsten where the \\"Mustard Point\\" meadow was donated by the town as a cemetery and memorial which was inaugurated 18 July 1945. It was the Hvidsten Group that supplied the explosives that made it possible to bomb the Langå bridges. Memorial The memorial is in a clearing close to the water and in view of the Bay of Aarhus and Helgenæs. The main component is a massive granite boulder with text inscriptions listing the men who were executed there and a short poem by Kaj Munk. The memorial is dedicated to the five men who were executed there and Kaj Munk. In addition there is one oak tree which was planted for each of the five men killed there.

Life He was the \\"grandson of a lyrical singer, in a family that had produced generations of musicians\\", and the son of Jean-Claude Beïret Montagné, a radio and electronics engineer who during the Vichy years went underground rather than submit to forced labor conscription; was imprisoned in Pamplona under the Franco regime; but eventually joined the Free French in Casablanca. In 1972 he graduated from René Simon's acting school and quickly found employment in the films of Robert Manuel as well as Luis Buñuel, who cast him as the Young Monk in The Phantom of Liberty (1974).  Career  From 1976 to 1978, Guy Montagné portrayed in several episodes the role of Guyomard in the television series Commissaire Moulin. In 1978, Stéphane Collaro engaged him to perform imitations and write comic texts of his radio program on Europe 1. Having found the sitcom Tous les chemins mènent au rhum, the first political radiophonic sitcom, propelled Collaro and Montagné at the top of the radio audience. These audience successes then became televisual from 1979 to 1981 with Le Collaro show. The Collaro troop pass from Antenne 2 to TF1 and the show was retitled Co-Co Boy where Guy Montagné met American coco-girl Terry Shane. She then became his wife and his screenwriter for his one-man shows. In 1985, he is the French voice of Donald Duck in the television program Le Disney Channel on FR3. For a decade from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, he knew his period of success, where he was very popular, with his neurotic, hot-tempered and talkative character. After that period, due to the departure of Stéphane Collaro for the channel La Cinq in 1987, the following period was darker and more difficult. In the 1990s, he began a career in cabaret where he played numerous shows, but the successful period of the 1980s was far. He asked from time to time his friend Patrick Sébastien to participate at his television shows, which gave him the opportunity to begin in the television field. But in the meantime, the audience began more attracted to other comics like Alex Métayer and Élie Kakou. His repertoire had no evolution and since the 1990s, his situation was similar to Jean Roucas. Willing to start again his career in cinema, he made the mistake in 1992 participating at the film of the return of Les Charlots without Gérard Rinaldi entitled Le Retour des Charlots. The film was a commercial failure and considered as a flop, which compromised his film career with a lot of refuses to castings. Guy Montagné was in the 1990s one of the most important personalities of the radio program Les Grosses Têtes hosted by Philippe Bouvard and also participated at the occasional television programs of the same name. In February 2014, he was victim of a facial nerve paralysis on the left side called Bell's palsy, due to the stress of the ticket theft of the show he had to play in the town of Muzillac in the department of Morbihan, and the way he was treated by the municipality after the theft, who refused to reimburse him. He then made a sketch of it. Treated at La Pitié-Salpêtrière in Paris, he was cured two months after the incident.  Filmography  * La Bonzesse (1974) ....

The peridinin molecules absorb light in the blue-green wavelengths (470 to 550 nm) and transfer energy to the chlorophyll molecules with extremely high efficiency. PCP complexes are found in many photosynthetic dinoflagellates, in which they may be the primary light-harvesting complexes.  Structure  The noncrystallographic trimer thought to be the biologically functional state of the A. carterae PCP complex. The lower left monomer is shown with pigments and lipids and is colored to indicate the pseudosymmetrical repeat; for the other two monomers, only the protein is shown, in tan and red. The PCP protein has been identified in dinoflagellate genomes in at least two forms, a homodimeric form composed of two 15-kD monomers, and a monomeric form of around 32kD believed to have evolved from the homodimeric form via gene duplication. The monomeric form consists of two pseudosymmetrical eight-helix domains in which the helices are packed in a complex topology resembling that of the beta sheets in a jelly roll fold. The three-dimensional arrangement of helices forms a boat-shaped molecule with a large central cavity in which the pigments and lipids are bound. Each eight-helix segment typically binds four peridinin molecules, one chlorophyll a molecule, and one lipid molecule such as digalactosyl diacyl glycerol; however, this stoichiometry varies among species and among PCP isoforms. The most common 4:1 peridinin:chlorophyll ratio was predicted by spectroscopy in the 1970s, but was unconfirmed until the crystal structure of the Amphidinium carterae PCP complex was solved in the 1990s. Whether formed from a protein monomer or dimer, the assembled protein-pigment complex is sometimes known as bPCP (for \\"building block\\") and is the minimal stable unit. In at least some PCP forms, including that from A. carterae, these building blocks assemble into a trimer thought to be the biologically functional state. When the X-ray crystallography structure of PCP was solved in 1997, it represented a novel protein fold, and its topology remains unique among known proteins. The structure is referred to by the CATH database, which systematically classifies protein structures, as an \\"alpha solenoid\\" fold; however, elsewhere in the literature the term alpha solenoid is used for open and less compact helical protein structures.  Function  A single peridinin molecule. Photosynthetic dinoflagellates contain membrane-bound light- harvesting complexes similar to those found in green plants. They additionally contain water-soluble protein-pigment complexes that exploit carotenoids such as peridinin to extend their photosynthetic capacity. Peridinin absorbs light in the blue-green wavelengths (470 to 550 nm) which are inaccessible to chlorophyll by itself; instead the PCP complex uses the geometry of the relative pigment orientations to effect extremely high-efficiency energy transfer from the peridinin molecules to their neighboring chlorophyll molecule. PCP has served as a common model system for spectroscopy and for theoretical calculations relating to the protein's photophysics. PCP complexes are thought to occupy the thylakoid lumen. After energy transfer from the peridinin to the chlorophyll pigment, PCP complexes are believed to then transfer energy from the excited chlorophyll to membrane-bound light harvesting complexes.

History  The area where the museum is located was the first oil exploration in Miri which used the Grand Oil Lady drilling rig. It produced oil starting from 22 December 1910 to 1972. One year after retirement on 1 October 1973, the Sarawak Shell Bhd handed over the property to Sarawak State Government in a simple ceremony. Four months after the handover ceremony, a bush fire occurred on the rig but was later extinguished quickly. Now the area no longer produces oil and has been declared as a protected historical site by Sarawak State Government. The museum was officially opened to the public on 20 May 2005 after it was financed by Shell Malaysia and Petronas.  Exhibition  The museum showcases various exhibits relating to history of petroleum industry in Malaysia. Inside the museum there are earthquake simulator, oil rig models etc. Outside the museum building is the Grand Old Lady oil rig. The former oil rig stands 30 meters tall.

Like other games, it follows the same basic structure: when a stage begins, the character receives introductory dialogue between playable characters, leading to the scenario on the battlefield. To complete a scenario, the player must accomplish scenario objectives. Some scenarios are longer, with multi-part missions or have new objectives added as the story unfolds. On battlefield, the player and enemy take turns to order their units with commands available, such as movement, attacking, forming squads and casting \\"Spirit Commands\\", a set of magic-like spells unique to each pilot. Once the scenario is cleared, more dialogue is exchanged between characters before the player is taken to an intermission menu. Here, units can be upgraded or optional parts installed, characters' stats and skills can be changed or upgraded, and other maintenance actions can be performed before the player continues on with the game. Newer gameplay elements is also been brought into the game with the reintroduction of the Beginner's Mode. It also introduces a new Skill Route and Skill Program function, which allows players to fully customize pilot's skills using Tactical Points, which were obtained through the game's play-through. The game also features two new gameplay mechanics: Extra Order and Extra Action. Extra Action allows player units to use ExC points in each stage to gain advantage in battle while Extra Order allows battleship units to raise spirits of each units. Aside from the new features, combination attacks also return in the game as well as a Remote Play and Cross Save function to play the game in both the Vita and the PlayStation 4 without losing progress. Both games won't allow any recording and screenshots except to certain scenes of the game. Like the previous games, Super Robot Wars V will have paid downloadable content in the future and comes with some downloadable content. Plot The creation of the first unified government over all humanity, the Earth Federation, marked the beginning of a new era: New Correct Century, and the beginning of humanity's expansion into space. However, it was also said to be the beginning of a new era of war. The battle between Earthnoids and Spacenoids that began with the One Year War raged on through Char's Rebellion, giving way to the so-called 10 Year Void, a decade-long gap in recorded history. A century has passed since then, and after the end of the Jupiter War, the Earth Federation was invaded by an alien species known as the \\"Gamillas\\". The Gamillas established a forward base on Pluto, and launched planet bombs at Earth. The planet bombs destroyed the space colonies and devastated Earth. The oceans were evaporated, the air was polluted, and the survivors were forced to retreat to shelters deep underground. Scientists estimated that only one year remained before humanity's extinction. The story revolves around Soji Murakumo and Chitose Kisaragi, who were caught up with the war with the Gamillas in the New Correct Century. While on their escape to the last hope of mankind: the space battleship Yamato, Soji/Chitose stumble upon a mysterious mobile unit constructed by the federation. Dubbed the VangRay, he/she pilots it in order to fend off the Gamillas invasion and buy time for the Yamato to appear and score humanity's first victory against them. With a promise of salvation from a distant planet known as Iscandar, Soji/Chitose join up with the Yamato crew in order to save mankind and depart on a journey of one hundred and sixty- eight thousand light years to Iscandar, not knowing they will encounter strange dimensional disturbances on the way. Development First announced at the 25th Anniversary Live Event alongside Super Robot Wars Original Generation: The Moon Dwellers, Super Robot Wars V continues the trend of the series for being a crossover tactical role-playing game featuring various mecha anime series from other studios. It is also announced in the live event that it is the second game in the series to officially receive an English release in Asia and the first game in series to be given a C rating by CERO. In addition to the enhanced animation and graphics seen in 3rd Super Robot Wars Z: Celestial Prison Chapter, the game also includes a cross-save feature like the previous entry. The game itself marks a lot of new entries to the series and also a lot of returns. The game marks the return of both Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ and Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam into the series proper, the first introduction of the second Brave Series into the game in the form of The Brave Express Might Gaine, and the debut of a non-mecha space opera anime series into the game in the form of Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2199,. However, the game marked as the first Super Robot Wars game to not include a series animated by Toei Animation. In the game's first promotional trailer, the game debuts the , an upgrade to Tetsuya's Great Mazinger, making it the second original Mazinger Mecha to debut in the game since Mazinkaiser. The game also introduces the original mecha , designed by Linebarrels of Iron Author and Mecha Designer Eiichi Shimizu, piloted by Soji Murakumo and Chitose Kisaragi. The game also reintroduces both the original versions of the Huckebein and the Grungust, piloted by Veltav Text and Charlotte Hastings, making it the third game to reintroduce both units since Super Robot Wars Alpha and five years after the absence of both the Huckebein and the original Grungust in 2nd Super Robot Wars Original Generation. According to Takenobu Terada, the \\"V\\" in the title stands for \\"Voyage\\", which represents the Franchise's new growth such as its marketing and localization outside Japan. Also, a Premium Sound edition of the game has been announced. Bandai Namco later announced that the second promotional video was released on January 17, 2017, revealing more information about the game including the game mechanics and gameplay.

It consists of three chapters: \\"Religion Versus the Religious,\\" \\"Faith and Its Object,\\" and \\"The Human Abode of the Religious Function.\\"  Summary  Dewey's overarching theme in A Common Faith is the role of distinct religious experience (separate from religions themselves, as outlined in the first chapter) in realizing human potential through action and imagination. Dewey lays out the direct purpose of this work in his closing statement at the end of the third chapter: \\"Here are all the elements for a religious faith that shall not be confined to sect, class, or race. Such a faith has always been implicitly the common faith of mankind. It remains to make it explicit and militant\\" (p. 80).Dewey, J. (2013). Terry Lectures: A Common Faith (2). T. A. Alexander (Ed.). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. Much like in many of Dewey's other works, democracy is a common theme throughout his statements in A Common Faith. There are three major themes present in A Common Faith. The first establishes distinct differences between \\"the religious\\" and religions themselves as experience. The second affirms God as \\"creative intersection of the ideal or possible and the real or actual,\\" while the third establishes \\"the infusion of the religious as a pervasive mode of experience into democratic life\\" (Alexander, p. 23).Dewey, J. (2013). Terry Lectures: A Common Faith (2). T. A. Alexander (Ed.). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. In his review of A Common Faith, A. E. Elder states that \\"There is potential in man a religious attitude towards life - a natural capacity for faith - which can so enrich life and advance human well-being, that if through misunderstanding or other causes it is suppressed, then human life as a whole is adversely affected and remains a poor and stunted thing\\" (p. 235).Elder, A. E. (1935). Reviewed Work: A Common Faith by John Dewey [Review of the book A Common Faith, by John Dewey]. Philosophy, 10(38): 235-236. . However, this religious attitude is not necessarily expressed through devotion to one particular religion; Dewey argues that this faith is present in experience itself. R.S. states in his review of A Common Faith that \\"…the central argument, as those who are acquainted with Professor Dewey's philosophy might expect, is designed to show that religion should be detached from its supernatural associations within organized historical institutions, and widened, on the basis of its function in experience, so as to cover all devotion to ideal ends inclusive enough to integrate a whole self and arouse emotional support\\" (p. 584).R. S. (1934). Reviewed Work: A Common Faith by John Dewey [Review of the book A Common Faith, by John Dewey]. The Journal of Philosophy, 31(21): 584-585. . In reference to the idea of the religious in A Common Faith, Baurain states that for Dewey, \\"…the religious is characterized by a rejection of creeds, doctrines, rituals, and other elements of organized religion. Instead, an authentically religious attitude or orientation is existential and humanist. Moral faith rests not upon a divine Supreme Being or divinely revealed truths, but upon the dynamic potential of inquiry to discover knowledge and pursue ideals, that is, to act on experiential knowledge in order to improve life\\".Baurain, Bradley. (2011). Common ground with a common faith: Dewey's idea of the \\"religious\\". Education & Culture 27 (2): 74-91. Retrieved from http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1268&context;=eandc. Central to this work is the idea that religious experience itself is not explicitly tied to singular religions, and that experience can and should be creatively harnessed to enrich life. According to Ralston, Dewey unified the ideal and the real under the banner of religious experience in A Common Faith so as to avoid the metaphysical dualisms implicit in most doctrinal religion: \\"Dewey’s union of the ideal and the real under the heading of religious likewise reflects an attempt to 'convert the ontological . . . into the logical' by showing that religious is a quality of lived experience, not of a supernatural thing, church, object of reverence, divine idol or realm of supersensible objects. To do otherwise endangers the process of inquiry by bifurcating reality into pregiven realms of religious and nonreligious objects; the former transcending the experiential conditions of the latter.\\" Ralston, Shane. (2007). John Dewey ‘on the side of the angels’: A critique of Kestenbaum’s phenomenological reading of A Common Faith. Education & Culture 23 (2): 63-75. Retrieved from https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context;=eandc. However, Dewey carefully defines the difference between ‘religion’ and ‘the religious’ in the first chapter of A Common Faith. M. C. Otto traces this difference, stating of A Common Faith that \\"Perhaps the most arresting thing is the distinction insisted upon between religion, any religion past or present, and the religious attitude or function. This is so sharply drawn that it almost seems as if Mr. Dewey were saying that every activity in the world may take on a religious character, excepting religion\\" (p. 496).Otto, M.C. (1935). Reviewed Work: by John Dewey [Review of the book A Common Faith, by John Dewey]. The Philosophical Review, 44(5): 496-497. Alexander posits that \\"...one of the central points Dewey seeks to make in A Common Faith is that both \\"faith\\" and the religious attitude have nothing to do with \\"doctrines\\" of any sort… Dewey states explicitly that his lectures were addressed to the antireligious naturalists and humanists who, he feared, had set up a new dualism, that between \\"Man vs. Nature,\\" in place of the old\\" (p. 356).Alexander, Thomas M. (2013). The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence. New York: Fordham University Press. In this way, this common faith is a push against the strict, binding doctrines of religious creed or scientific law that suppressed creativity and lived experience, disenfranchising many. In fact, in direct reference to A Common Faith, Dewey himself states that \\"…my book was written for the people who feel inarticulately that they have the essence of the religious with them and yet are repelled by the religions\\" (quoted in Webster p. 622).Webster, R. S. (2009). Dewey's democracy as the kingdom of God on earth. Journal of Philosophy of Education 43: 615-632. Dewey utilizes the word ‘common’ in the title of this body of work, referring to the potential for religious expression and spirituality in everyone and echoing his views on democracy. Alexander states, \\"To see something as \\"common,\\" for Dewey, is to grasp it imaginatively in terms of its possibilities for growth. Dewey's use of the word \\"common\\" should not be taken to indicate a complacent optimism based on satisfaction with things as they are now. To grasp the possibilities in the present requires creative exploration and struggle\\" (p. 23).Dewey, J. (2013). Terry Lectures: A Common Faith (2). T. A. Alexander (Ed.). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. Much in line with Dewey's other philosophies, Alexander goes on to say that \\"…a \\"common faith\\" means a faith in the potentialities of human life to become genuinely fulfilled in meaning and value, but only if those potentialities are actualized through action\\" (p. 21).Dewey, J. (2013). Terry Lectures: A Common Faith (2). T. A. Alexander (Ed.). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. Ultimately, in order to achieve this ‘common faith,’ Alexander states, \\"Dewey urges that we put the question of revealed truth aside and look at the effect such experiences have on the lives of the individuals who undergo them\\" (p. 24).Dewey, J. (2013). Terry Lectures: A Common Faith (2). T. A. Alexander (Ed.). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.

Lu was an influential and prolific Chinese language reformer in the late Qing dynasty (1644–1911) and early Republic of China (1912–49). Lu was born in Fujian Province on the southeast coast of China and was raised in Xiamen (historically called Amoy) where Christian missionaries had introduced a romanization of the local variety of Chinese that was widely used in newspapers and books. When he was 18, Lu Zhuangzhang failed the imperial examination for the civil service, and he subsequently converted to Christianity and sought out opportunities in the missionary community. In 1875, at the age of 21, Lu moved to Singapore where he intensively studied English. After returning to Xiamen in 1879, he worked as a language tutor and translator for Chinese and foreigners. John MacGowan of the London Missionary Society recruited Lu to help compile the English and Chinese Dictionary of the Amoy Dialect (1883), which used the romanization system from Carstairs Douglas' Chinese–English Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language of Amoy (1873) (Tsu and Elman 2014: 131). While assisting MacGowan, Lu extensively worked with the missionaries' system of huàyīn (話音 \\"speech-sound script\\") that used Latin alphabet letters to transcribe local varieties of Chinese, and came to believe that he could develop a better system. The speech-sound script required several letters to convey a pronunciation, making some word spellings longer than others. Lu devised a streamlined system of 55 distinctly pronounced zimu (字母 \\"alphabet letters\\"), symbols largely derived from the Latin alphabet. Based on the traditional Chinese fanqie method of indicating pronunciation with one Chinese character for the initial consonant and another for the final sound, Lu's system spelled each syllable with two zimu signs denoting the initial and final (Kaske 2008: 97). Lu Zhuangzhang's Qieyin Xinzi system was designed for Southern Min varieties of Chinese, specifically the Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou varieties, but he said that it could also be adapted for the other languages of China (Chen 1999: 165). Lu believed that his romanization method was easy to learn and claimed that a student could pick it up in a few weeks. However, when he tried teaching it to his family members, few could master the complex spelling rules, principles, and exceptions. The historical linguist Luo Changpei found Lu's scheme cumbersome and esoteric, \\"neither Chinese nor Western\\" (Tsu and Elman 2014: 132-134). After two decades of work on developing his New Phonetic Alphabet, Lu's innovative Yimu liaoran chujie: Zhongguo qie yin xin zi Xia qiang (一目了然初階: 中国切音新字廈腔 \\"First Steps in Being Able to Understand at a Glance: Chinese new phonetic script in the Amoy topolect]\\") was published in 1892. Victor H. Mair, a sinologist and professor of Chinese at the University of Pennsylvania, calls it \\"the first book written by a Chinese which presented a potentially workable system of spelling for a Sinitic language\\" and says Lu is now viewed as the \\"father of script reform\\" (2002). Among other improvements, Lu's Chinese romanization system links up syllables into words and separates them with spaces. Lu's 1892 preface to the Yimu liaoran chujie explains the New Phonetic Alphabet's pragmatic advantages. > Chinese characters are perhaps the most difficult of all characters in the > whole world today…. Normally, when one writes poems and essays, one uses > only a little over 5,000 of these characters. But if he wants to recognize > these several thousand characters, even the most intelligent person will > have to spend more than ten years of hard work. Herein lies the suitability > of spelling. In my humble opinion, the wealth and strength of a nation are > based on science; the advancement of science is based on the desire for > learning and understanding principle of all men and women, young and old. > Their being able to desire learning and understand principle is based on the > spelling of words.

It is > because they spell their words, because the written and the spoken word are > the same, and because the strokes of the letters are simple... That men and > women of foreign nations all can read is due to spelling. (tr. Mair 2002) The publication of Lu's work opened the floodgates for new systems of Chinese transliteration, and inspired others to develop 29 phonetic schemes between 1892 and 1910 (Kaske 2008: 152-158, Theobald 2011). When Lu later supervised a language school in colonial Taiwan, he realized the flaws with his Qieyin Xinzi and attempted to redesign the system on the basis of the Japanese kana syllabary, but there were already too many competing schemes (Tsu and Elman 2014: 134). Lu Zhuangzhang continued to work on reforming written Chinese, and in 1912 he was appointed as one of 55 members in the Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation, which developed Zhang Binglin's Jiyin Zimu (記音字母 \\"Alphabetic Phonetic Notation\\") into the Bopomofo transcription system, which the Beiyang government adopted in 1918 (Hsia 1956: 108). The linguist, sinologist, and lexicographer John DeFrancis dedicated his innovative ABC Chinese-English Dictionary to Lu Zhuangzhang and five other advocates of Chinese script reform, and described him as the \\"Pioneer reformer whose publication in 1892 of alphabetic schemes for several varieties of Chinese marked the beginning of Chinese interest in reform of the writing system\\" (1996: vi).

Founded in 1890, the club has held regular meetings at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for over 125 years, and has published the periodical Cassinia since 1901. Membership is open to any dues paying person with an interest in birds. The club organizes birdwatching field trips throughout the Delaware River valley region, including a dedicated year-round trip schedule within the city limits of Philadelphia (BirdPhilly).  History  The DVOC in 1898 The DVOC was founded on February 3, 1890 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by seven young men: (1) William Lloyd Baily, an architect who held the post of Inspector of Birds and Mammals at the Port of Philadelphia for 45 years; his uncle of the same name had authored the popular book Our Own Birds; a familiar natural history of the birds of the United States in 1867, (2) George Spencer Morris, an architect who was the great-nephew (on his mother's side) of Dr. John Spencer; Spencer had been a friend of Edward Harris, patron of John James Audubon, (3) J. Harris Reed, an architect who later became Philadelphia City Inspector, (4) Samuel Nicholson Rhoads, a farmer and bookseller who later suffered a mental breakdown and spent the remainder of his life in sanitariums, (5) Witmer Stone, who would become a famed naturalist and President of the American Ornithologists' Union and editor of its journal The Auk, (6) Spencer Trotter, a medical doctor and Professor of Biology at Swarthmore College, where Trotter Hall bears his name, and (7) Charles Voelker, a German-born taxidermist. Many past and present members of the DVOC have been active at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University. The founders and other early members of the DVOC contributed 2701 bird specimens, 65% of which were collected in the Delaware Valley, to the Ornithology Collection at the Academy.  Female Membership  The original constitution stipulated that members \\"shall be persons who are interested in ornithology considered in its widest sense,\\" and so did not technically prevent women from joining the DVOC. Notwithstanding, the culture of the club was not welcoming to them, and a separate organization (ironically, named after a man—the Spencer F. Baird Ornithological Club) was formed in 1900 by an enthusiastic group of female ornithologists in Philadelphia; but enthusiasm and membership eventually waned and that club was disbanded. The issue of female membership was formally discussed by DVOC members in November 1951, and thereafter became a hot-button issue in the club until membership was eventually granted to women in 1982: > \\"A committee had been appointed for the purpose of proposing a change in the > Constitution. After spirited discussion a vote was taken. The stand-patters > not only won the day with enough votes to keep the status quo, but succeeded > in making it official and not just implied by having the word \\"male\\" > inserted in Article II so that it read that the members \\"shall be male > persons.\\" A smoldering fire flares up into flame occasionally, and this was > no exception.

As Commissioner, it was she oversaw New Jersey's Department of Human Services. She served as Commissioner from 2007 to 2015 under Governors Jon Corzine and Chris Christie. Early life and education Velez was born in Englewood, New Jersey. Velez's parents divorced when she was still a toddler. Velez's family struggled financially, at times relying on public assistance programs. Velez's mother remarried and the family lived in South Hackensack before moving to a trailer park in Moonachie, New Jersey. Her mother worked as a secretary and her step-father worked in a factory. At a young age, Velez worked two paper routes to earn money. Velez attended Wood- Ridge High School and later Drew University. After graduating from Drew, Velez spent a year working in the underwriting department of an insurance company. She then returned to school, attending Rutgers Law School. Career= Early career  After graduating from law school, Velez began practicing law at Day Pitney. The focus of her practice was labor and employment law. Velez was unhappy in private practice and decided to move to government work after reading a newspaper profile of Bill Waldman, then the longest serving Commissioner of the Department of Human Services. Velez responded to the idea of working with people who needed help and began seeking out a job in the government. Velez's government job was working of the Chief Counsel's office during Republican Governor Christie Todd Whitman's time in office. Velez asked to be assigned to Human Services. She became Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Human Services in 2006. State Human Services Commissioner Governor Jon Corzine appointed Velez the State Human Services Commissioner in February 2007. She was confirmed and sworn in on June 21, 2007. As Commissioner, Velez was responsible for running the Department of Human Services, New Jersey's largest agency. The agency employed 15,000 people and had the largest budget of any individual state department. Following Chris Christie's election as governor in 2009, he reappointed Velez to the position of commissioner. During her tenure, Velez worked constructively with state legislatures and social services professionals. Velez advocated for individuals with developmental disabilities to live in homes that allow them to be part of the community. Velez oversaw the Medicaid expansion in New Jersey under the Affordable Care Act, providing Medicaid coverage for an additional 300,000 people statewide. Velez helped the state of New Jersey secure a waiver for a Medicaid overhaul in the state in 2012. The advocacy group Disability Rights New Jersey filed two major lawsuits filed against the state of New Jersey. The group accused the state of improperly segregating people with mental illnesses developmental disabilities. Velez was also criticized for the closing of two developmental centers and a psychiatric hospital which she oversaw. Critics of the closings, including disability advocates and family members of patients, argued the process was rushed and influenced by politics. In February 2015, Velez announced she would be leaving her post as Commissioner at the end of that month. Her eight-year tenure in the position was the longest in New Jersey history. Upon her resignation, Governor Christie praised Velez as \\"one of the smartest and most dedicated people\\" he knew in government and a \\"tremendous advocate in our efforts to deliver effective, cost-efficient, and high quality services to the most vulnerable New Jerseyans.\\" Velez was succeeded in the position by her chief of staff, Elizabeth Connolly. Connolly was sworn in as Acting Commissioner on February 28, 2015. Return to private sector Upon leaving the position of Commissioner, Velez accepted a position as Senior Vice President for Strategy and Planning at Barnabas Health. She officially joined Barnabas Health on March 10, 2015. In January 2016 was promoted to Senior Vice President of Population and Behavioral Health Integration, Barnabas Health.

This formation was assigned to the Western Front in mid-December as the Soviet winter counter-offensive west of Moscow was developing, but had the misfortune to be cut off and destroyed behind German lines. The division was formed again nearly two years later, this time in 1st Ukrainian Front, and served with distinction with this Front during the final twelve months of the war, winning honors for its roles in the fighting in Poland, Breslau and Berlin before ending the war near Prague. 1st Formation The division first formed on 1 September 1941 in the Oryol Military DistrictWalter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 at Voronezh, right alongside the 327th Rifle Division. Col. Nikolai Matveevich Makovchuk took command the same day and remained in that post until 7 February 1942. The division's basic order of battle was as follows: * 1110th Rifle Regiment * 1112th Rifle Regiment * 1114th Rifle Regiment * 895th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 78 In late October the division was assigned to 26th Reserve Army, which was forming up in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. At the beginning of December, the 329th was in the Moscow Defense Zone in the 60th Reserve ArmySoviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 8 before being reassigned to 5th Army in Western Front. Battle of Moscow 5th Army went over to the counteroffensive on December 6. By the close of December 11 the 329th, along with the 108th, 144th, and 19th Rifle Divisions had pierced the defensive front of the German 252nd, 87th, 78th and (coincidentally) 329th Infantry Divisions, and had reached the area of Lokotnya and Kolyubakovo. Western Front issued further orders for a continuation of the offensive on December 13. As well, Maj. Gen. Lev Dovator's 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps was moved to the 5th Army sector in the woods north of Kubinka. After a series of quick blows the rifle divisions mentioned above, plus the 50th, went over to the attack. Due to strong enemy resistance and extensive fortifications the assault made little immediate headway. However, enough of a gap was forced in the German line on the boundary between the 329th and the 19th divisions that the cavalry was able to pass through along a forlorn and roadless forest sector, beginning a deep raid which would disrupt and demoralize the enemy; already on the next day 5th Army resumed its advance. On December 20, the 19th and 329th Rifle Divisions forced the Ruza River and liberated three villages. But this river line had been fortified by the Germans, and 5th Army's forces had lost many men and much equipment over the course of its fighting pursuit, so it was necessary to call a halt.The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 3 In January 1942, the division formed part of the assault group of 33rd Army, which was driving through the lines of Army Group Center towards Vyasma. This objective was not quite reached, and the army was cut off behind German lines by counterattacks in early February. On the 8th, the division came under the command of Col. Kornei Mikhailovich Andrusenko. By the beginning of May, Western Front was developing a plan to break through to these isolated pockets with major forces and to hold them as staging areas for further operations. On May 10, Colonel Andrusenko handed command of the division to Col. Nikolai Lavrentevich Soldatov, who would hold the post until the division was disbanded. On May 20, by Front order, the \\"Special Group of General Belov\\" was created and consisted of Lt. Gen. Pavel Belov's 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, the 329th Rifle Division, units of the 4th Airborne Corps, and several large partisan detachments. However, the plan was never implemented, due to renewed German offensive action and the poor organization of the airlift operations that were intended to support Group Belov.Svetlana Gerasimova, The Rzhev Slaughterhouse, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, p. 55 Late winter snow and early spring mud had delayed the inevitable, but by the end of the month the Germans had reduced the remaining men of the 329th to small, barely organized groups. The division was carried under the Western Front reserves until June, but by then it was clear that not enough of these men would slip out of the forests and back to Soviet lines, and on August 22 the unit was officially disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 78 Colonel Andrusenko was one of those fortunate enough to escape, but his story nearly ended tragically as he was put on trial before the military tribunal of Western Front \\"for criminal inaction\\" during the encirclement battle. On April 6 he was deprived of his military rank and sentenced to death. He applied to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR for a pardon, and on May 4 his sentence was reduced to 10 years in the Gulag without full loss of rank, although he was demoted to Major. The sentence was also deferred until after the end of the war, so he continued to serve at the front. While Andrusenko had a further run-in with the military authorities later that year, he went on to regain his rank, be awarded the Gold Star Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership in crossing the Dniepr, and take command of the 55th Rifle Division.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=4530. Retrieved Jan. 6, 2017 2nd Formation After an effective absence of more than two years from the Red Army order of battle, a new 329th Rifle Division was formed on 4 May 1944, in the 3rd Guards Army of 1st Ukrainian Front, near Lutzk in the Kiev Military District.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p 125. Sharp states that the OoB of this formation was likely different from the 1st Formation, because many late-war divisions used lower regimental numbers made available by the conversion of rifle divisions into Guards units in 1942–43. Maj. Gen. Aleksei Aleksandrovich Yamanov was appointed as commanding officer on the same date; he was replaced by Maj. Gen. Zakhar Trofimovich Trofimov on July 26 when Yamanov was promoted to command of 21st Rifle Corps. The division remained in the same army and Front for the duration of the war. For most of 1944 it was in either 21st or 22nd Rifle Corps, but during the last weeks of the war it was in 120th Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 125 General Trofimov made way for Col. Ivan Ivanovich Yaremenko to take command a month later, and Yaremenko would remain there until the first few days of the next year. During the Vistula-Oder Offensive, on 15 January 1945 the division was recognized for its role in the liberation of the Polish city of Kielce: The division saw one more change of command on 4 February, when Col. Fyodor Fyodorovich Abashev took command and led the division to the war's end. On 5 April, the 329th was recognized for its contributions in the fighting around Breslau with the award of the Order of Kutuzov. When the division completed its combat path in Czechoslovakia in May, it carried the full title of 329th Rifle, Keletz, Order of Suvorov, Order of Kutuzov Division. (Russian: 329-я стрелковая Келецкая орденов Суворова и Кутузова дивизия.) Postwar On June 4 the 329th gained further distinction for its role in liquidating enemy forces in the southeast sector of the city during the Battle of Berlin with the award of the Order of the Red Banner. The division was disbanded \\"in place\\" with the Central Group of Forces in the summer of 1945.

It is said to be the controlling centre known as Parakramapura of Dakkhinadesa (South Country) in the 12th century, when it was ruled by Parakramabahu. The remaining ruins of the ancient kingdom still can be seen at Kotampitiya area which lies along Wariyapola-Chilaw main road about away from Wariyapola town. Name The so- called Chakrawalaya, foundations of a circular building or tower, and the subject of numerous stories The current site has been identified as Parakramapura, the city of Dakkhinadesa, founded by king Parakramabahu the great when he was the sub king of the territory, and called as Panduwasnuwara presently. It is believed that the name Panduwasnuwara was come to the usage during recent Kurunegala period. Due to its name this site is erroneously identified by the locals as the ancient capital of king Panduwasadeva who ruled the country in 504 BC to 474 BC. They believe that the structure known as Chakrawalaya which is situated in the site as the ektemge (a circular tower) where princess Unmada Chitra was confined by her brothers and also a nearby village called Dorabawa to be the Doramadalawa village where prince Pandukabhaya spent his childhood. But still there is no archaeological evidence to prove such stories. According to another belief the name Panduwasnuwara had been formed due to an ancient tank called Panda Wewa which is situated in nearby area. History The ruins of palace (12th century) As the Successor of his uncle king Kirti Sri Megha, prince Parakramabahu became the ruler of Dakkhinadesa in 1140 A.D. It was the first capital of Parakramabahu and one of the three discrete kingdoms into which the Island was divided. Historical evidences prove that king Parakramabahu had made steps to develop the infrastructure and other common facilities in the ruling territory. During this time period he had constructed a separate tooth temple at Panduwasnuwara Raja Maha Vihara premises for tooth relic of Buddha to keep it safe. After series of successful battles with his enemies Parakramabahu managed to conquer the control of entire nation and moved to Polonnaruwa where his new capital was built. The tooth relic of Buddha was also brought with him as the reputed symbol of principality. Ruins Ruins of Buddhist Panchayathana The ruins scattered over about 20 hectares in Panduwasnuwara are belong to 12th century A.D. Among the ruins a palace, monasteries, image houses, dagobas and monks' living quarters, carved pillars, guard stones, and other ancient constructions can be seen. The remains of the palace is bounded with moat and a brick rampart and the ground plan of the palace is similar to the palace of king Parakramabahu of Polonnaruwa. According to Stone seat inscription, a slab inscription established in the palace premises records that king Kirti Sri Nissankamalla (1187-1196 A.D.) visited this palace once on the way of his one of tours. From the south and north areas of the palace are remains of several monasteries belong to Panchayathana architectural style. Stupa, image houses, Bodhighara and dwelling houses are available in each monastery. Beside the Sinhalese inscriptions there is a Tamil inscription belonging to reign of Nissankamalla, in one monastery premises. Middle of the ruin site a modern temple, Panduwas Nuwara Raja Maha Vihara is situated and where small Tempita Vihara (Temple on pillars) and several pillar inscriptions belonging to 9-10th century A.D can be seen.

It details how to identity APTs and prioritize actions by applying skilled field-tested private- and government- sector processes and methods which often involves cyber deception. Content The book reviews most historical and significant malware: Titan Rain, Moonlight Maze, Stakkato and Stuxnet are reviewed in light of APT criteria. The exploitation's of the Stuxnet and these major cyber events are reviewed in an operational aspect. These exploits were so complex and were very expensive and that approaches an even less discussed concept that because the development of the APT is resource intensive, it is most often believed to be sponsored by a government in essence conducting an offensive action. In some countries this can be a crime while others consider it as an aggressive defensive technique. The work contains four stories regarding deception and counter deception. These are explained to be fictionalized works from actual events which occurred somewhere in the law enforcement and intelligence world, but there is no way of vetting this and it is not clear if these works are rooted in US domestic or international work. The cases are varied and considered compelling by noted cyber critics and reviewers of this work. The authors introduce the first theory for classifying a threat on the opportunistic-APT continuum as either persistent on non-persistent. The APT classifications and criteria are now widely used in the industry and are built off of an evaluation of these following criteria: APT CRITERIA * Objectives * Timeliness * Resources * Risk tolerance (by the adversary) * Skills and methods * Actions * Attack origination points * Numbers involved in the attack * Knowledge source * Threat Intelligence * Analysis of cyber espionage tactics contrasted with types of permissible countermeasures * How to use deception and disinformation campaigns * Case studies and real stories from the authors’ FBI, DOD, NSA, and private sector work. * Value Chain Management * Counter espionage and espionage * Legal interpretations of capacities, limitations, and stipulations for assisting law enforcement investigations.

It has a single spreading, hairy leaf and up to three small mustard-coloured flowers with red stripes. It is only known from a small coastal area near Cape Leeuwin where it grows in clumps of ten or more.labellum detail Description Caladenia caesarea subsp. maritima is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which often occurs in clumps of ten or more. It has an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. There are up to three flowers borne on a stem high and each flower is long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals are spread widely. The labellum is mustard-yellow with brownish-red stripes, projects prominently, has an irregularly serrated edge and two rows of shiny yellow calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to mid-September and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia caesarea was first formally described by Karel Domin in 1912 and given the name Caladenia filamentosa subsp. caesarea. Domin's description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany but in 1989 Mark Clements and Stephen Hopper raised it to species status. In 2001 Hopper and Andrew Brown described three subspecies, including subspecies maritima and the descriptions were published in Nuytsia. The epithet (maritima) is a Latin word meaning \\"of the sea\\", referring to the \\"coastal habitat of this species\\". Distribution and habitat Cape spider orchid occurs in the south-west corner of Western Australia between Dunsborough and Cape Leeuwin in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region where it grows in shallow soil on granite outcrops. It is endemic to Meelup Regional Park. Conservation Caladenia caesarea subsp. maritima is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"rare flora\\" under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950.

Mining is one of the main industries in Malaysia. Malaysia produces aggregate, bauxite, clay, coal, copper, feldspar, gold, gravel, ilmenite, iron ore, kaolin, limestone, mica, monazite, sand, silica sand, struverite and tin. History Tin mining in Perak around 1910. Tin mining is one of the earliest type of mining operated in Malaysia, starting in the 1820s in Perak and in 1824 in Selangor. The development of mining industries in Malaysia attracted many Chinese immigrants who came to the state in 18th and 19th centuries to work and develop the mine fields. Government Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources Mining-related activities in Malaysia is regulated by the Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources. The current Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resourcest Minister is Xavier Jayakumar Arulanandam from Pakatan Harapan-PKR. Economy Expansion of the tin mining began in the 1870s. As of 2003, mineral industry contributes to 7% of the GDP of Malaysia. Total export value were MYR143 million (mineral), MYR25 million (metallic mineral ores and concentrate), MYR93.5 million (non- metallic minerals). There are 70 mines operating around the country employing 3,249 workers. Types of mining=Aggregate Aggregate is produced in Malaysia from quarry and river bed which are mostly found in Johor, Perak, Sabah, Sarawak and Selangor. In 2012, the annual production of aggregate was 122,00,000 tons. Bauxite Bauxite is produced in Johor and Pahang. In 2012, the annual production of bauxite was 117,232 tons. In 2016, the Malaysian government bans bauxite mining activities until end of the year due to environmental damage and water contamination in Kuantan. Clay Clay deposits in Malaysia are mostly found in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Penang, Perak, Sarawak, Selangor and Terengganu. In 2012, the annual production of clay was 29,000,000 tons. Coal Major coal reserves in Malaysia are mostly located in Sabah and Sarawak with smaller reserves in Perak, Perlis and Selangor. The Labuan coal field produced coal starting 1848 until 1912. As of 1986, coal reserve in Malaysia was 965 million tons in which mostly are bituminous coal. The total known coal area is 5,823 km2. In 2012, the annual production of coal was 2.9 million tons. Feldspar Feldspar deposits in Malaysia are limited, but can be found in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang and Perak. In 2012, the annual production of feldspar was 350,000 tons. Gold Major gold mines in Malaysia are in Pahang, amely Penjom, Raub and Selinsing, as well as some minor areas in Kelantan and Terengganu. In 2011, the annual production of gold was 4,219 kg. As of 2012, there are active 15 gold mines.. There are no gold mines in Sabah and Sarawak Iron ore Currently there are 98 iron ore mines in operation in Malaysia. Most of them are small mines operating in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Malacca, Pahang, Perak and Terengganu. In 2012, the annual production of iron ore was 10,077,136 tons. Kaolin Kaolin reserves in Malaysia is estimated to be around 112 million tons which are spread in Johor, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Sarawak and Selangor. In 2012, the annual production of kaolin was 390,000 tons. Limestone Limestone deposit in Malaysia is abundant, with reserve estimated to be 12 billion tons located throughout Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Sabah Sarawak and Selangor. In 2012, the annual production of limestone was 36 million tons. Mica There are two mica mines in Malaysia, which are located in Bidor, Perak. In 2012, the annual production of mica was 4,000 tons. Sand and gravel Sand and gravel are found in Johor, Kedah, Perak, Sarawak and Selangor. In 2012, the annual production of sand and gravel was 40 million tons. Tin In 1979, Malaysia produced almost 63,000 tons of tin, accounting for 31% of world's output. Tin deposit spreads across western Peninsular Malaysia, particularly the Kinta Valley in Perak. In 1883, Malaysia was the largest tin producer in the world. In 1885, 12.8 km of railway was constructed connecting Taiping to Port Weld in Perak. The first trunk road in Peninsular Malaysia was constructed passing through major mining towns in Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan in which it was mostly used to transport tin from mines to ports. In the 1920s, dredging machines were introduced to boost the production of tin. Starting from the 1980s, tin mining in Malaysia experienced sharp decline due to competition from Brazil and the falling of tin price. In 1989, the Malaysian Tin Products Manufacturers' Association was established to promote and protect the downstream business of tin industry in the country.

She published under the name Tomiko Kōra ( '). Early life and education Kōra was born Tomi Wada on July 1, 1896 in Toyama Prefecture. She graduated from the Japan Women's University in 1917. While a student, she attended the funeral of Tsuriko Haraguchi, held at the university. Haraguchi was a psychologist and the first Japanese woman to obtain a PhD; Kōra was reportedly inspired by Haraguchi to continue her advanced studies in psychology. Like Haraguchi, she attended Columbia University, earning her Master's degree in 1920 and her Ph.D. in 1922. At Columbia, she collaborated with Curt Richter to conduct her experiments on the effects of hunger. Kōra's doctoral dissertation, completed under the supervision of Edward L. Thorndike, was titled An Experimental Study of Hunger in its Relation to Activity. She was the second Japanese woman to obtain a Ph.D. in psychology, after Haraguchi.  Career  After returning to Japan, Kōra worked as an assistant in a clinical psychiatry laboratory and taught at Kyushu Imperial University. She was promoted to associate professor, but was met with resistance because she was unmarried at the time. She resigned from the institution in 1927 and took a post at Japan Women's University, where she became a professor. Kōra was a member of the Japanese Christian Women's Peace Movement, and travelled to China. There, in January 1932, she met the Chinese writers Lu Xun and Xu Guangping at a bookstore owned by the Japanese Kanzō Uchiyama; shortly after, Lu Xun wrote a poem for her. Kōra was elected as a Councillor in the 1947 Japanese House of Councillors election, as a member of the Democratic Party. She switched to the Ryokufūkai party in 1949, and served in the House of Councillors for 12 years. In April 1952, Kōra attended the International Economic Conference in Moscow. Per a request from the US embassy, the Japanese Foreign Ministry had refused to issue passports to those who wished to travel to the Soviet Union; Kōra got around this restriction by travelling to Moscow through Paris, Copenhagen, and Helsinki. They met with vice-minister of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade Lei Rei-min and were invited to Beijing. At the time, the Japanese government did not recognize the legitimacy of the PRC government. That May, she visited Beijing as a member of the House of Councillors Special Committee for the Repatriation of Overseas Japanese. The visit was a diplomatic breakthrough, resulting in the first PRC–Japan private-sector trade agreement (signed June 1, 1952) and the resumption of the repatriation of Japanese left in China following the end of World War II. Both praise and opposition greeted the trade agreement from Japanese legislators. Kōra spent four days as a guest at the Women's International Zionist Organization in Israel in April 1960. Personal life In 1929, Kōra married psychiatrist Takehisa Kōra. They had three daughters, including the poet Rumiko Kōra. Kōra was a practising Quaker.

The festival includes &PROUD; LGBTIQ Film Festival, which usually occurs during the second weekend. In addition, there is an 'On The Road' programme that takes film screenings to other towns, cities and universities around Myanmar. Since 2019, &PROUD; runs an LGBTIQ community space in the Sanchaung Neighbourhood of Yangon as well as a mental health service called Yin Pwint Yar ('Open Your Heart'). The organizations receives funding from international donors such as embassies, UN organizations and INGOs.  History  &PROUD; was founded in 2014 by 3 co-founders, with the backing of Colors Rainbow (the main LGBT rights organization in Myanmar). At the time, there were no large public LGBT events in Myanmar, and same-sex relations remain illegal in Myanmar to date. &PROUD;'s first activity was a queer photo exhibition with work from Myanmar and Vietnam. As the exhibition was a success and without any government interference, the first LGBT film festival was organised at the French Institute in Yangon in November 2014. Between 2014 and 2017 &PROUD; continued to organise both a yearly film festival and photo exhibition, as well as film-making workshops and small screenings around Myanmar. In 2018 the organisation has received government permission to organise the festival at Thakhin Mya Park in downtown Yangon. That year, the festival was held over 2 weekends at the end of January, with the first weekend being a large Pride event in the park. In 2019 the festival changed its name to become Yangon Pride and the River Pride Boat Parade was added as a yearly event.https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/1618630/myanmars-first-lgbt-pride- boat-parade-sets-sail  Film Festival  The &PROUD; Yangon LGBTQ Film Festival had its first edition from November 14 to the 16 during the year of 2014 at the French Institute in Yangon.

Morazzone served as a simple parish priest in Lecco from his ordination as a priest in 1773 until his death and became noted amongst the faithful for his personal holiness and dedication to the sacraments. Morazzone's beatification process started in 1864 but later halted due to issues in Milan and the cause remained inactive until its revitalization in the 1950s. He was named as Venerable in 2007 and was later beatified at the Milanese Duomo on 26 June 2011. Life Serafino Morazzone was born in Milan in 1747 to Francesco Morazzone. He received his education from the Jesuits. In 1760 he was vested in the cassock and in 1761 was given the tonsure; he later received two minor orders in 1764 and the other minor orders later in 1771. In 1773 he was ordained as a sub-deacon and then a deacon and was ordained to the priesthood on 9 May 1773 at the church of Santa Maria at San Satiro.

Beatification The beatification process opened in Milan after Archbishop Paolo Angelo Ballerini inaugurated the diocesan process in 1864 and later closed it in 1867; the cause remained inactive due to situations in Milan despite attempts to revitalize it. Theologians later approved all of Morazzone's spiritual writings on 24 May 1958 and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated the informative process on 29 January 1993. Historians approved the cause on 15 December 1998 while the postulation later submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. in 1999; theologians approved it on 20 April 2007 as did the C.C.S. on 20 November 2007.

Carrillo describes him as \\"un dramaturge ...\\" He was born in Guatemala to María Isabel López Santa Cruz and Luis Dionisio Galich Urquía and was one of four children. In 1928 he received a scholarship and was accepted into the Escuela Normal para Varones, where he began his secondary schooling. Due to a strike at the Escuela Normal, he was transferred to the Instituto Nacional Central para Varones. There he obtained a masters in Primary Education and a bachelor's degree in Science in Letter. Manuel's artistic gifts were confirmed this year as he wrote and directed his first play titled Los conspiradores, which began his development as a playwright. One year later he imparted chairs of Pedagogy, Literature, Grammar, and History in the Escuela Normal Central para Varones and in the Instituto Normal Central para Señoritas Belén. In 1933 Manuel Galich entered into the Universidad Nacional from which he graduated as a lawyer. Two years after graduation he was appointed as Vocal II for the College of Lawyers before the Joint Directive of Faculty for the Legal and Social Sciences. From a very early age Manuel Galich was involved in theatre. During his time as teaching, Manuel Galich wrote theatre pieces with his students as the assembly. He began as an actor when he was eleven years old and also did work as a member of the “radioteatro” (radio theatre) for the official radio TGW of Guatemala. After some time he became an author of very valuable works of theatre. Manuel Galich was one of the most representative young people fighting against the dictatorships of both Jorge Ubico Castañeda and Federico Ponce Vaides. He also served as a revolutionary during the Revolution of October 20, 1944. In his book Del pánico al ataque tells of the fights his generation had to fight against the dictatorship. From 1944 to 1954 he held various positions including President of the Congress, Minister of Education, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and ambassador to Uruguay and Argentina during the Jacobo Árbenz government.

It has a single spreading, hairy leaf and up to three small lemon-yellow flowers with red stripes. It is only known from a single small population near the town of Williams. Description Caladenia caesarea subsp. transiens is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and about wide. There are up to three lemon-yellow flowers borne on a stem high and each flower is long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals spread widely. The labellum is lemon-yellow coloured with brownish-red stripes, projects prominently with a curled tip, has an irregularly serrated edge and two rows of shiny yellow calli along its centre. Flowering occurs between September and October and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described by Karel Domin in 1912 and given the name Caladenia filamentosa subsp. caesarea. Domin's description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany but in 1989 Mark Clements and Stephen Hopper raised it to species status. In 2001 Hopper and Andrew Brown described three subspecies, including subspecies transiens and the descriptions were published in Nuytsia. The epithet (transiens) alludes to the shape of the labellum which is intermediate between that of Caladenia filamentosa and the other subspecies of Caladenia caesarea. Distribution and habitat Dwarf mustard spider orchid only occurs near Williams in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region where it grows under dense rock sheoak and wandoo trees. Conservation Caladenia caesarea subsp. transiens is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

Tidal flooding, also known as sunny day flooding or nuisance flooding, is the temporary inundation of low-lying areas, especially streets, during exceptionally high tide events, such as at full and new moons. The highest tides of the year may be known as the king tide, with the month varying by location. Tidal flooding is capable of majorly inhibiting natural gravity-based drainage systems in low-lying areas when it reaches levels that are below visible inundation of the surface, but which are high enough to incapacitate the lower drainage or sewer system. Thus, even normal rainfall or storm surge events can cause greatly amplified flooding effects. One passive solution to intrusion through drainage systems are one way back-flow valves in drainage ways. However, while this may prevent a majority of the tidal intrusion, it also inhibits drainage during exceptionally high tides that shut the valves. In Miami Beach, where resilience work is underway, the pump systems replace insufficient gravity- based systems. United States Saltwater in drain on a bayfront street (Brickell Bay Drive) in Miami just up to street level; while not a direct flood, this inhibits normal passive, gravity-based drainage. Edgewater. In Florida, controversy arose when state-level government mandated that the term \\"nuisance flooding\\" and other terms be used in place of terms such as sea level rise, climate change and global warming, prompting allegations of climate change denial, specifically against Governor Rick Scott. This amid Florida, specifically South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area being one of the most at risk areas in the world for the potential effects of sea level rise, and where the frequency and severity of tidal flooding events increased in the 21st century. The issue is more bipartisan in South Florida, particularly in places like Miami Beach, where a several hundred million dollar project is underway to install more than 50 pumps and physically raise roads to combat the flooding, mainly along the west side of South Beach, formerly a mangrove wetland where the average elevation is less than . In the Miami metropolitan area, where the vast majority of the land is below , even a one-foot increase over the average high tide can cause widespread flooding. The 2015 and 2016 king tide event levels reached about MLLW, above mean sea level, or about NAVD88, and nearly the same above MHHW. While the tide range is very small in Miami, averaging about , with the greatest range being less than , the area is very acute to minute differences down to single inches due to the vast area at low elevation. NOAA tide gauge data for most stations shows current water level graphs relative to a fixed vertical datum, as well as mean sea level trends for some stations. During the king tides, the local Miami area tide gauge at Virginia Key shows levels running at times or more over datum. Fort Lauderdale has installed over one hundred tidal valves since 2013 to combat flooding. Fort Lauderdale is nicknamed the \\"Venice of America\\" due to its roughly of canals. A recent University of Florida study correlated the increased tidal flooding in south Florida, at least from 2011–15 to episodic atmospheric conditions. The rate was about 3/4 of an inch (19 mm) per year, versus the global rate of just over a tenth of an inch (3 mm) per year. History erosion and tides reached the foundation. Due to changing geography such as subsidence, and poorly planned development, tidal flooding may exist separate from modern nuisance flooding associated with sea level rise and anthropocentric climate change. The widely publicized Holland Island in Maryland for example has disappeared over the years mainly due to subsidence and coastal erosion. In the New Orleans area on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, land subsidence results in the Grand Isle tide gauge showing an extreme upward sea level trend. In March 2018, South Florida experienced significant coastal erosion and flooding outside of the usual king tide or hurricane season during a Nor'easter event.

It was closed down in 2010 upon orders from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, SEBIname=\\"forbes\\"> Founding Osian's art fund was India's first arts based fund. It was established in 2007 in Mumbai by Neville Tuli, an Indian who had reportedly spent eight years gambling in the UK (mostly on horses at Ladbrokes)and had returned to India in the early 2000s. The fund consisted of numerous schemes, which allowed people to invest a minimum of Rs 10 lakh and in multiples of Rs 5 lakh thereafter, promising annual returns of 10 percent. The fund in turn invested in art by Indian painters. The fund was not registered with SEBI. A similar fund floated by another company called \\"Yatra Art fund\\" also used a similar modus operandi. It too was finally closed down by SEBI in 2015. Modus Operandi The fund invested funds in art, including paintings, and had a functioning art auction house. As per Forbes and Moneylife India, Tuli built up a clientele in the nascent art scene in India, by attending socialite parties and get togethers, portraying himself to be an expert on art, writing books and subsequently floating an art fund that would invest in art. Investments in this art fund were sold through a tie up with the Indian division of ABN Amro, a Dutch bank. A high entry load was charged to all investors, and this was used for a while to pay them back. Subsequently, the fund ran out of money and after complaints were lodged by customers, it was investigated by the enforcement directorate in India. Osian's most popular fund offered was the \\"Osian’s Art Fund – Scheme Contemporary 1\\", a three-year scheme which matured in July 2009 and had 656 unit holders. Returns of up to 40 percent were promised to investors. The company in turn purchased art by Indian artists including MF Husain and FN Souza, but was only able to sell them at a loss, thus leaving its investors with their initial investments eroded. As per an investigation co0nducted by SEBI, the scheme had thus collected 102.4 crore rupees. A fund management fee of 3% was charged for purchasing units of Rs. 100 each, with an agreement to share the profits of sales with customers on a 30:70 basis and a promised hurdle rate of 15 percent. Closure Following complaints of non payment, the SAT (Securities Appellate Tribunal) ordered an investigation into the schemes floated by Osian. After hearing the case for over five years, it finally decided in April 2013 that the schemes floated by Osian were illegal 'Collective Investment Schemes', all carried out under the umbrella of \\"Osian's Connoisseurs\\", a sponsor and asset management company for Osian Art Fund. Thus they came under the gambit of SEBI and needed to be both registered as well as needed to comply with SEBI guidelines. Connosiers of Art pvt. ltd., the holding company of Osian's art fund was finally ordered to be closed in 2013 by the Securities and exchange board of India. Most of its customers did not receive their principal back. Its outstandings were to the tune of Rs. 40 crores in 2014. No charges were levied against the founder Tuli who continues to operate Osian from New Delhi under a revised banner. In 2014, Tuli appealed to a tribunal to allow Osian to continue, while he tried to pay back at least some of its customers. In April 2017, the art fund was formally closed down, though Osian continues to work in other fields including wildlife. Meanwhile, Abraaj Capital, a Dubai-based investment company filed a suit in London’s commercial court against Osian to recover the $23.7 million it gave Bregawn Jersey, one of Tuli’s many offshore companies, to seed an international venture called the India Asia Arab Art Fund. Osian’s most ambitious project, Osianama, an art conservatory and pop culture museum, is yet to rise from the land in Central Mumbai where the famed Minerva theatre once stood. As per Forbes, the list of people who invested in Osian's art funds including the \\"Connoisseurs of Art\\" fund includes Sanjeev Khandelwal (Khandelwal Laboratories), industrialist Gautam Thapar, Pramit Jhaveri (Citibank), Sheshasayee Properties (Kumar Mangalam Birla), Priya Paul (Apeejay Surendra Group), HCL Corporation Ltd., Roshni Nadar, Ashok Alexander (Gates Foundation), celebrity cook Tarla Dalal, Jaithirth (Jerry) Rao (the founder of MphasiS), Kamal Morarka (Gannon Dunkerly) and Sangita Kathiwada.

Ciesielski was married and was also a close personal friend of Karol Józef Wojtyła – the future Pope John Paul II. Ciesielski worked as a professor and was a civic engineer himself and died in an accidental shipwreck in the Nile River. Ciesielski's beatification cause started under John Paul II in 1992 and the confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis to name him as Venerable on 17 December 2013. Life Jerzy Ciesielski was born on 12 February 1929 in Kraków to Philip Ciesielski and Maria Tatarczany; his older brother was Roman (1924–2004) who became a professor of civil engineering. Ciesielski was a civil engineer and worked as a professor at the Tadeusz Kościuszko University of Technology as well as at the University of Khartoum. Ciesielski loved handball as well as canoeing and camping and rowing and was known for being an avid sportsman. He was a close personal friend of Karol Józef Wojtyła – the future Pope John Paul II – and the two were close for decades until Ciesielski's death. The two first met while he was a student and the then Father Wojtyla invited him to join his youth groups out in the country alongside other students and this was how he met his future wife who would later recall: \\"Father Karol came with us on trips to concerts, to the theatre and the cinema ... we talked during excursions, around the fire and at organized meetings which took place in our homes\\". He married Danuta Plebańczyk on 29 June 1957 in a marriage that Bishop Wojtyla officiated at. The couple went on to have three children: * Maria (b. 1958) * Kasia (1961 – 9 October 1970) * Piotr (1962 – 9 October 1970) In 1968 he first came into contact with the Focolare Movement and he became quite impressed with their mode of evangelical life that he and Doctor Giuseppe Santacnhé (part of the Italian branch) went to Cardinal Wojtyla for his blessings and also in the hopes of allowing for a Polish-based branch. He joined Focolare in the summer of 1969 after a week-long vacation he spent in Zakopane. Ciesielski died on 9 October 1970 on the Nile River in a shipwreck. His children Kasia and Piotr also died in that accident while his wife was at their hotel it occurred. Cardinal Wojtyła returned from Rome when he heard about what had happened and presided at the funerals for the three. Ciesielski's remains were relocated in 1998 to the Church of St. Anne, Krakow in Kraków. Beatification process The beatification process commenced in Kraków in a diocesan process that Cardinal Franciszek Macharski inaugurated on 31 December 1985 and closed later on 29 May 1990; the formal introduction came under Ciesielski's old friend John Paul II on 7 February 1992 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled him as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. validated the diocesan process on 21 February 1992 and received the Positio from the postulation for assessment in 1995. Theologians voiced their assent to the dossier's contents on 25 September 2012 as did the members of the C.C.S. on 17 December 2013. Pope Francis named Ciesielski as Venerable on 17 December 2013 after confirming that he had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is the Rev. Michał Jagosz.

The film is about a ‘rite of passage’ or, more accurately, a ‘baptism of fire’ that three children are initiated through. On a more theoretical level, the film can also be interpreted as a simile expressing the trials and tribulations of societies or nations during the course of progress. Mehrdad Oskouei's documentary must not simply be seen as only a tale about the lives of children in a juvenile detention centre. It is also a reflection of some of the most compelling problems faced by individuals as they struggle toward maturity and the strongest emotions felt as they grapple with social and personal evolution. Stages of development and their corresponding emotions are depicted through the experiences of Oskouei's three protagonists, Vahid, Ali and Sajad. By describing the ordeal of three boys in a house of correction he is simultaneously prescribing possibilities for instilling hope; gaining knowledge through feelings of regret; and understanding the significance of innocence in the face of injustice.

Simplot Company, and his first wife Rudy Rosevear. He received a Bachelor of Science in Business from the University of Idaho in 1968 and went on to earn a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973. Career Simplot first obtained a seat on the J.R. Simplot Company board of directors in 1970 and was hired as the company's director of planning and information technology in 1973, following his graduation from Wharton. He was quickly promoted to more senior positions and became chairman of the board of directors in 2001 after he reportedly \\"pushed out\\" his father, J.R.; the two adopted markedly different approaches to management. During his time at J.R. Simplot Company, Simplot has been credited with engineering the company's lucrative early-stage investment in Micron Technology, which grew to 22-percent of that company by 1996. He is also responsible for the company's 2003 purchase of the Australian arm of John West Foods. In addition to his seat on the J.R. Simplot Company board, he also serves on the boards of directors of nearly a dozen other companies. In 2016, Forbes named him the wealthiest man in Idaho, with an estimated net worth of $2.1 billion. Personal life Bloomberg News described Simplot as being \\"unassuming, with a thoughtful, almost professorial air,\\" a marked contrast to his gregarious father, which was reflected in their different management styles with J.R. acting on hunches and Scott preferring detailed analysis of potential business actions. He is divorced and has two daughters. His sister, Gay Simplot, is also a billionaire and works with Scott in running the J.R. Simplot company. Gay is divorced from the former Governor of Idaho, Butch Otter.

The film stars Iko Uwais as a man with amnesia who must battle a criminal syndicate to protect the doctor (Chelsea Islan) who saved his life. Headshot was released on September 9, 2016, at the Toronto International Film Festival. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Synopsis In the prologue, mobster Lee (Sunny Pang) escapes from prison in a shootout that leaves dozens of prisoners and guards dead. Two months later, a comatose man of unknown identity (Iko Uwais) is being cared for by Dr. Ailin (Chelsea Islan) in a rural hospital on a small island. He awakes, but with no clear memory of how he was injured or even his name. He adopts the name Ishmael from Moby-Dick, which Ailin is reading. He learns he was found on the beach by a man named Romli (Yayu Unru). Meanwhile, Lee and his henchmen Rika (Julie Estelle) and Besi (Very Tri Yulisman) violently eliminate a rival gang. One of the gang's survivors tells Lee about Ishmael, and Lee sends the man to investigate. Ishmael and the thug have a brief altercation after the man threatens Ailin. Ailin travels to the mainland to seek better care for Ishmael, but her bus is stopped by Lee's men, who are looking for Ishmael (who they call Abdi). They kill every passenger but Ailin and a young girl, whom they kidnap. Called by Ailin, Ishmael and Romli hurry to the scene of the bus attack. Ishmael kills a few of Lee's thugs who remain at the scene, but Romli is also killed. An Interpol agent tells Ishmael about children kidnapped by Lee's syndicate and bred to be devoted smugglers and criminal enforcers; Ishmael was one of these children. The agent is killed when a group of Lee's killers attacks the police station in an attempt to take out Ishmael/Abdi. Ishmael puts down the attackers instead and escapes. Ishmael must then go to war with the syndicate to save Ailin. While traveling, he encounters Besi near a well, and it is revealed that he, Rika and Besi trained together. Lee would put children in the well and starve them. After a few days, he would put food in there, and the child who killed all the others to get the food would be freed. Ishmael tries to persuade Besi to not be on Lee's side, but Besi refuses out of loyalty. They soon enter in a fight, and Ishmael gains the upper hand. After Besi dies, Rika finds out and attacks Ishmael. Ishmael defeats Rika despite multiple wounds from the latter, and it is revealed that Rika was the one who shot Ishmael and gave him memory loss. When Rika holds Ishmael at gunpoint, she can't bring herself to shoot Ishmael again, and instead shoots away from Ishmael, wasting her bullets. In the confusion, Ishmael accidentally deals Rika a mortal injury by reflexively throwing a knife. After comforting her in her dying moments, Ishmael finds Lee's hideout. Meanwhile, a henchman is about to rape Ailin, but Ailin and the child fight him off, eventually shooting him with his own rifle. Ishmael and Ailin meet each other, and even though Ailin threatens Ishmael because she was kidnapped due to their relationship, Ishmael convinces her not to, and they embrace. However, Lee arrives, and is enraged that Ishmael killed Rika and Besi, whom he had considered favorite \\"children.\\" They then enter a brutal fight, with Lee gaining the upper hand due to his strength. However, Ishmael finally beats Lee outside, and impales him on the sharp branch of a tree trunk. In his death throes, Lee is about to kill Ishmael by pulling him closer to the same sharp trunk, but Ailin saves Ishmael. Lee finally succumbs to his wounds, and dies. In the aftermath, Ailin is recovering in the hospital, with Ishmael wounded severely. However, he wakes up with Ailin by his side, and Ailin smiles.Iko Uwais Starrer ‘Headshot’ Scores Global Deals – Toronto Cast * Iko Uwais as Ishmael/Abdi * Chelsea Islan as Ailin * Sunny Pang 馮推守 as Lee * Julie Estelle as Rika * David Hendrawan as Tejo * Zack Lee as Tano * Very Tri Yulisman as Besi * Bront Palarae as Interpol Agent Ali * Yayu Unru as Romli * Ario Bayu as Jakarta Police Captain * Hirooki Goto as Japanese Thug (Cameo) Production Headshot was directed by Timo Tjahjanto and Kimo Stamboel, known as the Mo Brothers, who had never directed an action film before.

The building houses the art collection of the counts of Harrach.  Medieval castle and \\"Herrschaft\\" or dominion  In the 12th century, the Marquis of Cham and Vohburg held the area around Rohrau. Dietrich de Rorow was first mentioned in 1240 as living in the Haus Liechtenstein. His line died out in 1278 with Dietrich III. His daughter Diemut married Leutold I von Stadeck († 1292/95). After the death of the last Johann Stadeck in 1399, Duke Wilhelm wanted to give it to his brother Ernst dem Eisernen, but heiress Guta married Hermann II, Count of Celje and received it from King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia as a gift. In 1402, Rohrau came into the hands of Ulrich, son of Hugo von Montfort-Pfannberg, who inherited from Guta. In 1404, King Ruprecht gave the Montforts the castle and dominion, which they owned for 120 years.  Harrach family  The Harrach family first appeared in southern Bohemia in the 13th century, later in neighbouring Mühlviertel, including the wealthy town of Freistadt. The Harrachs owned estates in Styria and Carinthia at one time, but their main interests shifted to Vienna (see Palais Harrach) and Lower Austria. Leonhard III von Harrach inherited the castle and in 1524, during the Counter- Reformation, his son Leonhard IV took the side of the Catholics. He was granted nobility in 1552 and, in 1584, the Order of the Golden Fleece. In 1586, he retired after 55 years of service to the court of Vienna and devoted himself to the Rohrau castle. He died in 1590 and was buried in the Augustinian Church, Vienna. In 1593, the Turks stormed the castle. The damage was repaired in 1599–1605 and is documented in the family's archives.Gräflich Harrachsches Familienarchiv, Schachtel 716  Art collection  View of the Gemäldegalerie der Harrach´schen Familiensammlung The castle houses the Graf Harrach’sche Familiensammlung, one of the largest private collections in Austria.

With a total installed capacity of , it is one of the largest pumped-storage power stations in Japan. The facility is run by the Kyushu Electric Power Company. The power plant started operation in July 2007 and all four units were commissioned by July 2011. Like most pumped-storage facilities, the power station uses two reservoirs, releasing and pumping as the demand rises and falls. Oseuchi Dam and Kanasumi Dam form the upper artificial reservoir, while Ishikawauchi Dam on the Omaru river (Omarugawa) forms the lower reservoir. Ishikawauchi Dam is a 47.5 m concrete gravity dam, while Oseuchi and Kanasumi dams are rock-fill dams, 65.5 m and 42.5 m high, respectively. The natural influx on water on the upper reservoir is limited, therefore the plant can be considered almost pure pumped-storage. The entire upper pond was made waterproof with asphalt to avoid leakage in the surrounding permeable soil. The two reservoirs are connected through underground penstocks. The power plant is located underground in the middle. The power station employs 4 pump-generators. Unit 1 and 4 were manufactured by Hitachi, while units 2 and 3 are from Mitsubishi. The maximum amount of water used by the plant is 222 cubic meters per second, for an effective storage capacity of 7 hours. All units are adjustable speed systems, allowing for a rapid variation of power levels during both pumping and generation. A visitor's center, Pino' Q Park, was opened by Kyushu Electric Power in July 2008. The center features miniature models of the power plant, videos and other media to explain the operation of the pumped-storage plant.

Life=Family provenance and early years Carlos José Lambert is believed to have been born in or near La Serena. However, surviving records of his birth and baptism have not been identified. (In the 1820s members of the European expatriate community frequently attended to baptismal formalities not in Roman Catholic churches onshore, but on British ships moored offshore.) His father Charles Saint Lambert (1793-1876), was a prominent, and increasingly prosperous, mining entrepreneur who had been born near Strasbourg and emigrated to Chile in 1817. He established contacts in England, acquired British nationality and returned to Chile in 1823 as a representative of a British company called the \\"Chilean Mining Association\\", which later went bankrupt. The career of Charles Saint Lambert (the father) continued to prosper, however. Little is known of his mother, who is frequently described as \\"English\\", although at least one source indicates that she was born further north, in Scotland. Charles Joseph Lambert spent much of his childhood in Britain. Around 1840 his father relocated the family base to Swansea which was becoming the principal smelting centre for industrial scale copper (and other) ores from Chile, following the exhaustion of principal mines closer to hand in Cornwall. In Swansea he was involved in regular commercial negotiations with Edward Bath, scion of a major industrial family in the area (and subsequently his brother-in-law twice over). In practice, he appears to have divided his time between Chile and South Wales throughout his working life. Activities in Chile As a mining engineer he exploited new copper-smelting technology employing \\"coal-using reverbatory furnaces\\" which his father had introduced to Chile during or before the 1830s and which at this stage gave an important competitive advantage. He was also active as a farmer, with an extensive property in the valley of the Rapel River, centred on a Welsh style farmhouse. This farm also included silver deposits which he exploited. He actively promoted the construction of the railway connecting La Serena with the port of Coquimbo, taking a significant shareholding in the project, which also linked up two of the family's smelting locations. He promoted the exploitation of sheep imported from England and Australia, as well as raising sheep himself. In La Serena he also backed the drainage project, proposing the construction of a canal to divert water from the Elqui River to an outlet near the port which would drain the coastal area of the Bay of Coquimbo. At the start of the Pacific War in 1879 he is identified as the originator of fortifications along the Bay of Coquimbo. This involved (at least) three gun emplacements covering the bay. There were good strategic reasons to protect the port in order to avoid the interruption of the transport of ores from the Lambert mines to the industrial processing plants in Swansea and to prevent an attack on the domestic smelting works at \\"La Compañía\\", a couple of kilometers inland from the bay. It was thought likely that Peruvian forces would attempt to paralyse the mining industry in the region which was seen as vital to sustaining the economy in wartime. Philanthropy Lambert was an active philanthropist, funding the construction and operation of hospitals in La Serena and Vicuña. He funded the health commission to combat cholera and smallpox. At Christmas he was in the habit of appearing on the city streets accompanied by his family loaded with parcels for distribution to the poor families of La Serena. Round the world in 713 days On 5 May 1880, embarking from Cowes on the Isle of Wight (England), Charles Joseph Lambert set sail aboard the company yacht for a round the world trip, accompanied by his wife, their four youngest children, a governess, a nurse, a maid, a valet, a footman, a minister of the church and an artist called Robert Prichett. Their boat, \\"The Wanderer\\", was coal powered, also capable of sail propulsion when the wind blew appropriately. Lambert kept a detailed record of the adventure in which he recorded that 1265½ (British) tons were consumed by the voyage. The ship was operated by 8 officers and 35 crewmen (not necessarily all at once) and the staff also included 7 ships' stewards. It may have been this voyage that inspired William Stanley Lambert, the couple's youngest son, who celebrated his eleventh and twelfth birthdays during the voyage, regarding his subsequent decision to join the British navy, which he did in 1885. During the voyage the family were able to visit Hawaii to pay their respects to their dead son Carlos who had drowned there on 20 November 1870 while serving in the navy. The family had already erected a memorial to their dead son back home at \\"La Compañía\\" outside La Serena, and now they were able to erect another \\"cenotaph\\" with a cross near the site of his death. Death Charles Joseph Lambert himself died on 11 July 1888. He suffered \\"an epidemic of ‘choleric diarrhoea’\\" and booked a passage on a steamship to Liverpool where he spent his final months staying in an hotel beside the Royal Yacht Club. The actual death took place not in Liverpool, however, but at Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

Its aim was to take control of the rebel-held part of western Ghouta. The main rebel stronghold in the region was the town of Khan al-Shih. The offensive The offensive was launched on 1 October 2016, with the Army taking control of 10 kilometers of farmland around the town of Deir Khabiyeh, east of Khan al-Shih, within 24 hours. All of Deir Khabiyeh's farmland had been secured by 3 October. Ten days later, the military seized a former air-defense base west of Deir Khabiyeh, partially surrounding the town on its western and southern side. The following day, the Army captured Deir Khabiyeh, after which they turned their focus to Khan al- Shih. Between 7 and 9 October, government troops captured the Milano Steel factory near Al-Mokaylebah, as well as the Al-Wadi area one kilometer west of the town, while also advancing in the northwestern outskirts of Khan al-Shih. On 18 October, a potential agreement on a rebel surrender in the town of Zakiyah was reached. By 21 October, after advancing in the Al-Buwaydah Farms on the southwestern outskirts of Khan al-Shih, government forces broke through rebel lines, securing the southwestern axis of the town. Two days later, the northwestern farms of Khan al-Shih were also captured, partially surrounding the town. On 24 October, a rebel counter-attack at Khan al-Shih was repelled. On 28 October, Khan al-Shih was fully surrounded after a nearby air-defense base was captured by the Army and thus cutting the rebel's supply route between Khan al-Shih and Zakiyah. Between 2 and 3 November, government forces again advanced in the Al-Buwaydah Farms areaمعارك مستمرة في غوطة دمشق الغربية مع قصف مكثف بالبراميل المتفجرة على المنطقة and ultimately seized the village of Al-Buwaydah on 4 November.قوات النظام تواصل تقدمها في غوطة دمشق الغربية وتضيسق الخناق على خان الشيح On 3 November 33 rebels were killed in the fighting. On 5 November, the rebels in Khan al-Shih started negotiating to surrender and be evacuated from the area. Concurrently, over the next 24 hours, the Army dropped about 35 barrel bombs on the town. On 6 November, the negotiations collapsed and the Army continued with its operations, taking control of the air-defense housing. Two days later, a rebel counter-attack against Al-Buwaydah Farms was repelled. The Army then proceeded to take control of the Drosha road, tightening the siege of Khan al-Shih, which resulted in a new round of surrender negotiations. As of 9 November 48 barrel bombs had been dropped on Khan al-Shih and 23 ground-to-ground missiles had been fired at the town. On 10 November, the rebels managed to make some advances in the area between Al-Buwaydah and Deir Khabiyeh. Between 11 and 13 November, another 73 barrel bombs were dropped on Khan al-Shih. During this time, the Army established fire-control over the Zuhair area in the eastern outskirts of Khan al-Shih and managed to fully besiege the town. They also took control of the largest rebel weapons factory in the western Ghouta, an animal farm and Khirbet Khan al-Shih near the Air Defense housing.قوات النظام تحقق تقدماً جديداً في محيط خان الشيح المحاصرة بعد قصف مكثف استهدفها وغارات تخلف جرحى بالغوطة الشرقية A new rebel counter-attack at Khan al-Shih was repelled on 16 November. The following day, the Army took control of farms near the town of Mid’aani, as well as reportedly the Skaik farms of Khan al- Shih. On 19 November, the Army made new advances with the capture of the Qusur district in the east of Khan al-Shih, while they also advanced again in the west of the town. In the evening, an agreement was reached for the rebels to surrender the town. Under the terms of the agreement, the Army withdrew from the Qusur district it had captured a few hours earlier and a 48-hour ceasefire came into effect. If the ceasefire would hold, the rebels would be evacuated to rebel territory in the Idlib Governorate. 1,000 rebels were to be transferred to Idlib, while those staying would have their cases settled by the Syrian authorities. On 27 November, the rebels handed in their heavy weapons and 1,450 fighters and 1,400 of their family members departed for Idlib the following day. On 29 November, militants from Zakiyah also handed over control of the town to the Syrian government and set off towards Idlib, while insurgents in three other nearby villages also agreed to withdraw from Western Ghouta. The final batch of rebels from Khan al-Shih and all of the nearby villages was evacuated between 30 November and 1 December, leaving the area firmly under government control.

Biography  Born in 1957 in London, Roger Wagner won an open scholarship to read English Literature at Lincoln College Oxford in 1975. While a student he attended classes at the Ruskin School of Drawing, where he now teaches, and in 1977 edited The Oxford Art Journal, the forerunner of the present academic journal that began the following year. From 1978 to 1981 he studied at The Royal Academy Schools under Peter Greenham, and subsequently returned to Oxford where he now lives and works. In 1985 he had his first exhibition with Anthony Mould who has represented him ever since. Alongside the paintings were wood- engravings from his first book of illustrated poems Fire Sonnets. An exhibition in 1988, In a Strange Land, included a book of that title which included poems and a translation of psalm 137 illustrated with wood-engravings of the London docklands. Several more recent exhibitions have included successive volumes of The Book of Praises: an illustrated translation of the psalms, the first volume of which appeared in 1994. This was the year of his retrospective exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, whose attendance figures broke all records.Katherine Eustace, Roger Wagner Paintings, Anthony Mould (1995) In 2004 the Ashmolean had a second exhibition of his work to celebrate the acquisition of his large painting Menorah which now hangs on permanent loan in St Giles Church. In 2012 he made his first stained glass window, opposite John Piper’s window in St Mary’s Iffley, followed by a font cover made in collaboration with Nicholas Mynheer. Both were nominated for the ACE prize for art in a sacred context. In 2014 he painted the first portrait of the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, which now hangs alongside Thomas Lawrence’s portraits in Auckland Castle. In 2016 Oxford University Press published The Penultimate Curiosity co-authored with Andrew Briggs, the Professor of Nanomaterials at Oxford.In 2019 The Canterbury Press published The Nearer You Stand, Poems and Images.  Style and Influences  Wagner’s work has been described as ‘totally unlike any other modern artist’.Richard Harries, The Image of Christ in Modern Art, Ashgate (2013) p147 In 1988 the poet Peter Levi wrote of his second exhibition that ‘Nothing could be less expected than his paintings; they are completely careless of fashion. In some ways they are very old fashioned indeed, but in the most important way modern. He has the power to create a myth’.Peter Levi, In a Strange Land, Anthony Mould (1988) An early influence was the painting of Giorgio de Chirico whom he met in Venice in 1973. Chirico described his own style as ‘metaphysical’ and though very different the same term could be applied to Wagner’s work. This has been described as ‘imbued with Fra Angelico, Blake, Palmer and Traherne’,Anne Wroe, Six Facets of Light, Jonathan Cape (2016), p179 but it also often imbued with what Samuel Johnson described as a characteristic of the metaphysical poets in which ‘the most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together’.Samuel Johnson, Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets, vol. 1 (1779) Thus Rowan Williams has described Wagner’s ‘fusion of Jewish and Christian symbols with the cooling towers of Didcot power station – Jewish victims of the Shoah wandering in the neighbourhood of a distantly seen, conventionally depicted crucifixion, the background dominated by the immense towers arranged in the pattern of the ceremonial candlestick, the menorah that gives this 1993 painting its title.’, as this is ‘very dense imagining indeed, but it manages a representation of the creatively and theologically uncanny that is haunting’.Rowan Williams, The Guardian, Books 31 January 2004  Collections  *NatWest Collection, London *The Takeover Panel, City of London *The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford *St Giles Church, Oxford *Auckland Castle *Dioezesanmuseum, Regensburg  Bibliography  *Fire Sonnets, The Besalel Press 1984 *In a Strange Land, The Besalel Press 1988 *The Book of Praises: A Translation of the Psalms, The Besalel Press 1994 *A Silent Voice, The Besalel Press 1996 *Out of the Whirlwind, Solway 1997 *Art and Faith, in Public Life and the Place of the Church, Ashgate 2006 *The Book of Praises: A Translation of the Psalms (Book Two), The Besalel Press 2008 *The Book of Praises: A Translation of the Psalms (Book Three), The Besalel Press 2013 *The Penultimate Curiosity (with Andrew Briggs) OUP 2016 * The Nearer You Stand, Poems and Images , Canterbury Press 2019  Further reading  *Roger Wagner Paintings 1982-1994.

It has rough, flaky bark on the base of its trunk, smooth coppery-coloured bark above, lance- shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and conical to cup-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus cuprea is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough flaky, box-style bark for up to of the trunk, smooth copper-colour to pale orange-grey bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped, dull greyish green leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy green on both sides long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, about long and wide with a rounded operculum, usually with a small point on the tip. Flowering occurs between August and November and the flowers are white or creamy-white. The fruit is a woody conical to cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with the valves deeply enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus cuprea was first formally described in 1993 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper from a specimen collected by Brooker north of the Murchison River in 1984. The specific epithet (cuprea) is a Latin word meaning \\"coppery\\" in reference to the seasonal colour of the smooth bark. Eucalyptus cuprea belongs in Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Adnataria (also known as the boxes). Within the Adnataria section, E. cuprea is part of a subgroup, series Buxeales which are all found in south-eastern Australia, with only three occurring in Western Australia, those being E.cuprea , E. absita and E. lucasii. All three have inflexed stamens which separates them from the eastern species. Distribution and habitat Mallee box is found in a small area in the Geraldton hills in the Mid West region of Western Australia where it grows in shallow sandy soils over granite. It occurs in almost pure stands. Conservation status Eucalyptus cuprea is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). An Interim Recovery Plan has been prepared. The main threats to the species include farming activities such as grazing by sheep, weed invasion, land clearing, firebreak maintenance and inappropriate fire regimes.

Improper use of asbestos and injury from exposure is addressed through administrative action, litigation, and criminal prosecution. Injury claims arising from asbestos exposure may be tried as mass torts. Civil litigation Asbestos litigation is the longest, most expensive mass tort in U.S. history, involving more than 8,000 defendants and 700,000 claimants. By the early 1990s, \\"more than half of the 25 largest asbestos manufacturers in the US, including Amatex, Carey-Canada, Celotex, Eagle- Picher, Forty-Eight Insulations, Manville Corporation, National Gypsum, Standard Insulation, Unarco, and UNR Industries had declared bankruptcy. Analysts have estimated that the total costs of asbestos litigation in the U.S. alone will eventually reach $200 to $275 billion.\\" The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases. Claims made against employers by injured workers will typically be in the form of a workers compensation claim, although the long onset for diseases such as mesothelioma may make it impossible for a worker to pursue workers' compensation benefits. However, it is possible for an injured worker to also bring a product liability claim against a third party that is responsible for introducing asbestos into the workplace. Plaintiffs' attorneys have attempted to offer \\"every exposure\\" or \\"substantial factor\\" liability theories under which they do not need to prove defendants were the proximate cause of plaintiffs' injuries because no level of asbestos exposure is safe.. This approach has been rejected by U.S. District Judge David C. Norton. Asbestos lawsuits in the U.S. have included the following as defendants: # manufacturers of machinery that are alleged to have utilized asbestos- containing parts; # owners of premises at which asbestos-containing products were installed; # retailers of asbestos-containing products, including hardware, home improvement and automotive parts stores; # corporations that allegedly conspired with asbestos manufacturers to deliberately conceal the dangers of asbestos; # manufacturers of tools that were used to cut or shape asbestos-containing parts; and # manufacturers of respiratory protective equipment that allegedly failed to protect workers from asbestos exposure. Common defensesThird-party liability= Manufacturers of machinery in which asbestos-containing parts were used have contested liability on the grounds that nearly all of them either did not ship asbestos-containing parts with their products at all (that is, asbestos was installed only by end users) or did not sell replacement parts for their own products (in cases where the plaintiff was allegedly exposed well after any factory-original asbestos- containing parts would have been replaced), and either way cannot be responsible for toxic third-party parts that they did not manufacture, distribute, or sell. In 2008, the Washington Supreme Court, the first state supreme court to reach the issue, decided in favor of the defense.Braaten v. Saberhagen Holdings, 165 Wn.2d 373, 198 P.3d 493 (2008) and Simonetta v. Viad Corp., 165 Wn.2d 341, 197 P.3d 127 (2008). On January 12, 2012, the Supreme Court of California also decided in favor of the defense in O'Neil v. Crane Co.O'Neil v. Crane Co., 53 Cal.4th 335, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 288, 266 P.3d 987 (2012). =Chrysotile vs. amphibole= Another area of dispute remains the so-called chrysotile-defense. Manufacturers of some products containing only chrysotile fibers claim that these are not as harmful as amphibole-containing products. As 95% of the products used in the United States historically were mostly chrysotile, this claim is widely disputed by health officials and medical professionals.Straif K. The Carcinogenicity of Asbestos – Evaluations by IARC and WHO, Recent Developments and Global Burden of Asbestos-Related Cancer. Abstract SY02-07 of paper presented during Symposia: Asbestos – A Global Disaster in Seoul, Korea. Page 28-29, Collection of Conference Abstracts of The XVIII World Congress on Safety and Health at Work. The World Health Organization recognizes that exposure to all types of asbestos fibers, including chrysotile, can cause cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovary, mesothelioma, and asbestosis. =Ethics= Defendants in asbestos litigation have accused the lawyers who represent plaintiffs of unethical conduct, but those allegations have not been successful in stopping the litigation, nor have courts been sufficiently convinced by the allegations to sanction the law firms against whom the allegations have been raised. * Screening and solicitation: Defense firms allege that most lawsuits involving claims for non-malignant asbestos injuries are generated by asbestos screening companies, firms that are generally closely connected to trial lawyers but are run by people with no medical training. Some legal scholars suggest that because lawyers often find screening companies using union locals as intermediaries the rule is not violated. Defendants also allege that plaintiffs' obtain diagnoses from physicians who do not follow proper standards when testing patients. * Excessive legal fees: Defendants have attempted to claim that contingency fees in asbestos cases are unreasonable, because the cases may not involve much risk or effort on the part of the plaintiff's lawyer. However, these claims have proved unsuccessful. * Product identification: As product identification is the most important part of preparing witnesses in asbestos cases, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they were exposed to enough asbestos for a long enough time derived from the product of a particular defendant in order to win their claim. Defendants have claimed that plaintiffs' lawyers manipulate their clients to identify solvent companies as suppliers instead of those that have filed for bankruptcy. No court has accepted this allegation. Asbestos bankruptcy trusts Since the bankruptcy filing of Johns-Manville in 1984, many U.S. and U.K. asbestos manufacturers have avoided litigation by filing bankruptcy. Asbestos bankruptcy trusts are personal injury trusts established by firms that have filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code to pay personal injury claims caused by exposure to asbestos. At least fifty-six trusts were established from the mid-1970s through 2011. The largest 26 of these trusts paid about 2.4 million claims totaling about $10.9 billion up to 2008. The trusts are governed by trust advisory committees that are generally controlled by lawyers from a few prominent law firms such as Baron & Budd, P.C. and Weitz & Luxenberg P.C. Bankruptcy trusts may pay pennies on the dollar to people injured as a result of asbestos exposure. At the same time, these trusts may permit larger numbers of claimants to receive some kind of compensation, even if greatly reduced from potential recoveries in the tort system. =Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement= The federal Medicare Secondary Payer law imposes penalties for paying settlements directly to claimants without repaying the government for medical costs covered under the same programs under the legal doctrine of subrogation. In late 2016, attorneys general from 13 states sent demand letters to bankruptcy trusts for Armstrong World Industries, Babcock & Wilcox, DII, and Owens Corning. The purpose of the demand letters was to determine if the funds are reimbursing states for medical treatment received under Medicaid and Medicare. =Bankruptcy trusts and litigated claims= The pursuit of compensation for asbestos injuries often involves both litigation against solvent defendants and filing claims against asbestos bankruptcy trusts. The amount of compensation recovered by an injured plaintiff may depend on whether evidence of exposure to products from bankrupt firms is introduced at trial. If no evidence of exposure from bankrupt firms is presented then increased financial responsibility is likely to be assigned to solvent defendants. Researchers from RAND Corporation found that if a company filed for bankruptcy plaintiffs claimed exposure to their products in interrogatories and depositions at significantly reduced rates. When a plaintiff claiming an asbestos injury has filed a claim against a solvent defendant, courts may extend or reopen discovery when it is discovered that the plaintiff failed to disclose a trust claims. For example, in the 2008 case of Edwards v. John Crane-Houdaille, Inc production of claim forms was delayed until two weeks before trial.Edwards v. John Crane-Houda ille, Inc., No. 24X08000351 (Md. Cir. Ct. Balt. City July 31, 2008). In the 2004 case of Stoeckler v. American Oil Co.Stoeckler v. Am. Oil Co., No. 23,451 (Tex. Dist. Ct. Angelina Cnty. Jan. 28, 2004). the defendants discovered that the plaintiff did not disclose trust claims only three days after the start of the trial, resulting in the re- opening of discovery. To help avoid this type of issue, Judges will often adopt mandatory disclosure obligations for bankruptcy trust claims. Regulation According to a September 2004 of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, asbestos is still a hazard for 1.3 million US workers in the construction industry and for workers involved in the maintenance of buildings and equipment. Asbestos is not part of an ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) E 1527-05 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA). A building survey for asbestos is considered an out-of- scope consideration under the industry standard ASTM 1527-05 Phase I ESA (see ASTM E 1527-05). ASTM Standard E 2356-04 should be consulted by the owner or owner's agent to determine which type of asbestos building survey is appropriate, typically either a baseline survey or a design survey of functional areas. Both types of surveys are explained in detail under ASTM Standard E 2356-04. Typically, a baseline survey is performed by an EPA (or state) licensed asbestos inspector. The baseline survey provides the buyer with sufficient information on presumed asbestos at the facility, often which leads to reduction in the assessed value of the building (due primarily to forthcoming abatement costs). Note: EPA NESHAP (National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants) and OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) Regulations must be consulted in addition to ASTM Standard E 2356-04 to ensure all statutory requirements are satisfied, ex. notification requirements for renovation/demolition. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ) innocent purchaser defense. In some instances, the U.S. EPA includes asbestos contaminated facilities on the NPL (Superfund). Buyers should be careful not to purchase facilities, even with an ASTM E 1527-05 Phase I ESA completed, without a full understanding of all the hazards in a building or at a property, without evaluating non-scope ASTM E 1527-05 materials, such as asbestos, lead, PCBs, mercury, radon, et al. A standard ASTM E 1527-05 does not include asbestos surveys as standard practice. Federal In 1988, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued regulations requiring certain U.S. companies to report the asbestos used in their products. A Senate subcommittee of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee heard testimony on July 31, 2001, regarding the health effects of asbestos. Members of the public, doctors, and scientists called for the United States to join other countries in a ban on the product. Several legislative remedies have been considered by the U.S. Congress but each time rejected for a variety of reasons. In 2005, Congress considered but did not pass legislation entitled the \\"Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005\\". The act would have established a $140 billion trust fund in lieu of litigation, but as it would have proactively taken funds held in reserve by bankruptcy trusts, manufacturers and insurance companies, it was not widely supported either by victims or corporations. On April 26, 2005, Philip J. Landrigan, professor and chair of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, testified before the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary against this proposed legislation. He testified that many of the bill's provisions were unsupported by medicine and would unfairly exclude a large number of people who had become ill or died from asbestos: \\"The approach to the diagnosis of disease caused by asbestos that is set forth in this bill is not consistent with the diagnostic criteria established by the American Thoracic Society. If the bill is to deliver on its promise of fairness, these criteria will need to be revised.\\" Also opposing the bill were the American Public Health Association and the Asbestos Workers' Union. On June 14, 2006, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved an amendment to the act which would have allowed victims of mesothelioma $1.1M within 30 days of their claim's approval. This version would have also expanded eligible claimants to people exposed to asbestos from the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and to construction debris in hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Ultimately, the bill's reliance on funding from private entities large and small, as well as debate over a sunset provision and the impact on the U.S. budgetary process caused the bill to fail to leave committee. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has no general ban on the use of asbestos. However, asbestos was one of the first hazardous air pollutants regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act of 1970, and many applications have been forbidden by the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). State In 2010, Washington state passed a ban on hazardous materials in automotive brakes, phasing out asbestos in vehicle brakes, starting in 2014. In 2013, Ohio passed became the first state to pass a law requiring transparency in asbestos bankruptcy trust claims. The same year Oklahoma passed a similar law called The Personal Injury Trust Fund Transparency Act. This law applies to all personal injury trusts. It requires plaintiffs to disclose all previously filed and anticipated trust claims for personal injuries within 90 days of filing a personal injury tort but not until at least 180 days before the assigned court date. If the plaintiff anticipates filing a trust claim all proceedings are stayed until their filing is complete. Filing new claims or amending claims after the initial disclosure triggers a new disclosure requirement. The law also allows defendants to stay proceedings by showing that the plaintiff could make a good faith filing with a trust. The law gives plaintiffs ten days to either file such a claim or show that it would probably be unsuccessful. In South Carolina in 2015, State Senator Shane Massey introduced Senate Bill 281, \\"The Court Transparency Act.\\" S.281 would prohibit the state of South Carolina from hiring outside lawyers. Similar bills have been passed into law by 18 states. The bill would also prevent juries from awarding damages that exceed actual out of pocket costs incurred by plaintiffs. In June 2015, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, signed Texas House Bill 1492 into law. The law was written to end so-called asbestos \\"double dipping\\" in Texas. This law requires asbestos victims to perform more actions before proceeding to trial, and lowers the standard of proof of asbestos exposure for manufacturers to shift the blame onto other bankrupt companies. A year earlier, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed a similar bill into law. In June 2016, President Obama signed into law the Frank R. Lautenburg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 2576). It serves to reform the TSCA of 1976 and aims to make federal safety regulations on toxic substances and chemicals effective. In 2017, Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota all passed asbestos trust claims transparency laws. Abatement Old Wailuku Post Office sealed off for asbestos removal. Asbestos abatement (removal of asbestos) has become a thriving industry in the United States. Strict removal and disposal laws have been enacted to protect the public from airborne asbestos. The Clean Air Act requires that asbestos be wetted during removal and strictly contained, and that workers wear safety gear and masks. The federal government has prosecuted dozens of violations of the act and violations of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) related to the operations. Often these involve contractors who hire undocumented workers without proper training or protection to illegally remove asbestos.Father and Son Get Long Terms In Defective Asbestos Removal\\", The New York Times, December 24, 2004. Retrieved 2008-04-04. W. R. Grace and Company faces fines of up to $280 million for polluting the town of Libby, Montana. Libby was declared a Superfund disaster area in 2002, and the EPA has spent $54 million in cleanup. Grace was ordered by a court to reimburse the EPA for cleanup costs, but the bankruptcy court must approve any payments. Notable cases=Civil The U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with several asbestos-related cases since 1986. Two large class action settlements, designed to limit liability, came before the court in 1997 and 1999. Both settlements were ultimately rejected by the court because they would exclude future claimants, or those who later developed asbestos-related illnesses. These rulings addressed the 20-50 year latency period of serious asbestos-related illnesses. =Borel v. Fibreboard Corp.= In this case a federal appeals court ruled that an insulation installer from Texas could sue asbestos manufactures for failure to warn. Borel's lawyers argued that had warning labels been affixed to Fiberboard's products he would have been able to protect himself more effectively. =Manville= The Manville Corporation, formerly the Johns-Manville Corporation, filed for reorganization and protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code in August 1982. At the time, it was the largest company ever to file bankruptcy, and was one of the richest. Manville was then 181st on the Fortune 500, but was the defendant of 16,500 lawsuits related to the health effects of asbestos. The company was described by Ron Motley, a South Carolina attorney, as \\"the greatest corporate mass murderer in history.\\" Court documents show that the corporation had a long history of hiding evidence of the ill effects of asbestos from its workers and the public. =Garlock= In a decision from January 2014, Gray v. Garlock Sealing Technologies had entered into bankruptcy proceedings, and discovery in the case uncovered evidence of fraud that led to a reduction in estimated future liability to a tenth of what was estimated. =RICO cases= A number of lawsuits have been filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in response to what defendants claim to be fraudulent asbestos-related lawsuits. RICO suits are civil in nature and brought by private parties. They typically allege that the suits themselves are forms of racketeering or that lawyers and experts had to engage in racketeering activities in order to bring them. For example, *in 2012 a lawsuit was filed by CSX Transportation Inc. alleging that lawyers and a doctor who represented plaintiffs in asbestos cases had engaged in acts of civil racketering in their pursuit of fraudulent claims, resulting in a verdict in favor of CSX Transportation. The lawsuit was later settled on appeal, leaving in place the civil racketeering verdict in favor of CSX Transportation. *In 2014, attorneys for Garlock Sealing Technologies, LLC, filed a lawsuit against four asbestos litigation firms, alleging civil racketeering. In March 2016 Garlock, and its parent company EnPro, entered into a settlement that involved the dismissal of their racketeering claims and the payment of $480 million to settle related asbestos injury claims. *In 2016, John Crane Group filed lawsuits against Simon Greenstone Panatier and Shein Law Center in federal court, alleging that the defendant law firms withheld evidence in violation of the RICO Act. One of the defendant law firms has filed a motion to dismiss the claims. Criminal Some companies and their executives have faced criminal prosecution for their actions in exposing workers to the dangers of asbestos, or their improper handling of asbestos waste. =Adamo Wrecking Company= On February 20, 1973 a federal grand jury in Detroit, Michigan indicted Adamo Wrecking Company (\\"Adamo\\") for violating provisions of the Clean Air Act by knowingly causing the emission of asbestos by failure to wet and remove friable asbestos materials from demolitions. Adamo was one of a number of demolition contractors indicted throughout the country for the alleged violation of the Clean Air Act. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan dismissed the criminal indictment on the ground that it was not an \\"emission standard,\\" but a \\"work practice standard,\\" which under the terms of the statute, did not carry criminal liability. The government appealed and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, stating that it erred in determining that it had jurisdiction to review the validity of the standard in a criminal proceeding. Adamo's attorneys appealed to the Supreme Court.\\"Summary of Actions by Supreme Court on Various Cases\\", New York Times, April 5, 1977. On January 10, 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Adamo when it held that the trial court did have jurisdiction to review the standard in a criminal proceeding and also agreed with the trial court that the requirements in the act were \\"not standards\\" but \\"procedures\\" and therefore the proceedings were properly dismissed. =W. R. Grace and Company= A federal grand jury indicted W. R. Grace and Company and seven top executives on February 5, 2005, for its operations of a vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana. The indictment accused Grace of wire fraud, knowing endangerment of residents by concealing air monitoring results, obstruction of justice by interfering with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation, violation of the Clean Air Act, providing asbestos materials to schools and local residents, and conspiracy to release asbestos and cover up health problems from asbestos contamination. The Department of Justice said 1,200 residents had developed asbestos-related diseases and some had died, and there could be many more injuries and deaths. On June 8, 2006, a federal judge dismissed the conspiracy charge of \\"knowing endangerment\\" because some of the defendant officials had left the company before the five-year statute of limitations had begun to run. The wire fraud charge was dropped by prosecutors in March. =Other prosecutions= On April 2, 1998, three men were indicted in a conspiracy to use homeless men for illegal asbestos removal from an aging Wisconsin manufacturing plant. Then-US Attorney General Janet Reno said, \\"Knowingly removing asbestos improperly is criminal. Exploiting the homeless to do this work is cruel.\\" On December 12, 2004, owners of New York asbestos abatement companies were sentenced to the longest federal jail sentences for environmental crimes in U.S. history, after they were convicted on 18 counts of conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, and actual violations of the Clean Air Act and Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The crimes involved a 10-year scheme to illegally remove asbestos. The RICO counts included obstruction of justice, money laundering, mail fraud and bid rigging, all related to the asbestos cleanup. On January 11, 2006, San Diego Gas & Electric Co., two of its employees, and a contractor were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that they violated safety standards while removing asbestos from pipes in Lemon Grove, California. The defendants were charged with five counts of conspiracy, violating asbestos work practice standards and making false statements.

It has smooth, powdery white bark, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus cupularis is a tree that typically grows to a height of , sometimes as high as , and forms a lignotuber. It has powdery, white smooth bark that is pale pink when young. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section and egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same dull green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds usually sessile. Mature buds are oval, glaucous, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. Flowering occurs between October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to conical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim. Eucalyptus cupularis is similar in appearance to and closely related to the Kalumburu gum (E. herbertiana) and the mountain white gum (E. mooreana). Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus cupularis was first formally described by the botanist Charles Austin Gardner in 1964 from a specimen collected on stony hills to the west of Halls Creek and the description was published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet (cupularis) is the diminutive form of the Latin word cupa meaning \\"cup\\", hence \\"little cup\\", referring to the shape of the fruit.

In 2008, she adopted her second artist name \\"Kennedy James\\" and moved to NYC with an artist visa. Since 2015, she goes as \\"govy\\", her rare French family name.  Early work  Before debuting her visual work with photography, govy performed in a few theater, video pieces and films but then decided to focus on writing. In 1999, she published the first book on the internet that actually looked like a real book, which would be published in 2001 under the title \\"Mes Cendres Nues\\" by French publisher IDLivre. Her early writing is also part of the French Poetry Anthology \\"Les Nouveaux Poètes Français et Francophones\\", published by Edition Huguet in 2004. In 2000 she started an interactive piece where she would photograph her daily life during one year without interruption. This early piece launched her career as a visual artist as it was one of the first interactive pieces on the internet at the time and created before the fashion of photographic diaries via blogs would start spreading worldwide in 2004. In retrospect, it could be considered an art piece very much about growing up on the Autism Spectrum and struggling with a personal quest of identity. This work has received two awards and has been exhibited internationally in art galleries and museums.  Muse  In 2011, her face launched the storytelling website Cowbird, with the first story published \\"1000 Words\\" written by Scott Thrift. The City and Horses pop band wrote a song about their relationship in 2013.

Elspeth Reoch (died Kirkwall 1616) was an alleged Scottish witch. She was born in Caithness but as a child spent time with relatives on an island in Lochaber prior to travelling to the mainland of Orkney. At that time the Orkney archipelago was under the legal jurisdiction of Scotland which, with the implementation of the Scottish Witchcraft Act of 1563, made witchcraft a capital offence, therefore punishable by death. The early years of the 17th century were a time of political turmoil on the islands as the transition of power between Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney and the staunch episcopalian Bishop James Law took place. Once in control, Bishop Law instigated court reforms in 1614 that academics considered had a significant impact on witchcraft trials in Orkney. Any references to a fairy in statements given to interrogators by alleged witches were routinely changed to read devil or demon. At her trial in Kirkwall on 12 March 1616 Reoch confessed to charges of witchcraft and deceiving islanders by pretending she was mute. Asserting she had received instructions on how to acquire magical powers when she was twelve years old while she was staying with an aunt in Lochaber, she claimed to have clairvoyance abilities. She also professed to being able to induce or cure illness by reciting chants while plucking petals from the melefour herb. Her lifestyle was that of a wanderer or vagabond who used her magic to support herself. Reoch was found guilty and executed by strangulation; her body was burned that afternoon. Background The islanders of Orkney had a long tradition of belief in broadly construed forms of witchcraft, sorcery and supernatural creatures. Magical powers were accepted as part of the general lifestyle and were not questioned. Witch hunts in Scotland began in about 1550; the parliament of Mary, Queen of Scots passed the Scottish Witchcraft Act in 1563, making witchcraft convictions subject to capital punishment. Although the Orkney archipelago was officially under Norwegian law until 1611, it had been held by Scotland from 1468 under the rule of Scottish earls. Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney, known as Black Patie, had control of the islands in 1594 at the time of the initial witch trials but the early years of the 17th-century were a period of political turmoil. Black Patie was incarcerated and eventually executed after he enraged King James who appointed James Law, a staunch Episcopalian, as Bishop of Orkney. Law took on the role of sheriff and oversaw later trials. The historian Liv Helene Willumsen considers the court reforms instigated by Bishop Law around 1614 and the restoration of the bishops impacted significantly on the witch trials but failed to improve the neutrality of the proceedings. Personal life Reoch's father, Donald Reoch, was a piper in the service of the Earl of Caithness. She had a sister and a brother. Although born in Caithness she stayed on an island in Lochaber, where at least two of her aunts lived, before arriving in Orkney. No clear records of Reoch's marital status exist, but she bore at least two children to two men. After the birth of her first child Reoch maintained she was unable to speak. By this time her father had died leaving her brother as her most senior relative. She was violently beaten by him in his attempts to force her to talk. Using a form of torture that was similar to one later utilised by Graham of Claverhouse, he tightened a bowstring around her head; he also used a bridle with an iron bit to beat her. The beatings proved unsuccessful so he made her attend church with him to pray for help curing her; Reoch however remained mute for a lengthy period. Orcadian historian Ernest Marwick describes her lifestyle as that of a wanderer, a person with nomadic tendencies or a beggar, whose claims of extrasensory perception provided her with an income. He considered her to be \\"harmless\\", a \\"poor deluded creature much abused by men whom she took to be fairies\\". She may have suffered from a type of sleep paralysis and also have been subjected to some form of trauma, possibly rape or incest, memories of which formed the basis of the story she relayed to her inquisitors. Historian Diane Purkiss speculates that Reoch's brother may have been her incestuous partner although this opinion is not shared by other academics. Charges and confession Under interrogation Reoch stated that when she was twelve years old she was staying in Lochaber with one of her aunts. While she was standing at the side of the loch, waiting for a boat, she was approached by two men, one dressed in black the other in a plaid of green tartan. The man in green told her he thought she was pretty; despite protests from his companion, who felt Reoch would be unable to keep a secret, the man suggested he could tell Reoch how to know anything she wanted. Keen to possess mystical powers, Reoch pressed him to tell her what to do. He told her to boil an egg but she must not eat it. Instead she was to use the condensation from cooking the egg to rub on her eyes with unwashed hands, which would give her the power to see and know everything she wanted. She said the man dressed in green told her to go to the house of another one of her aunts who had a widow and her granddaughter either lodging or visiting. The family were unaware that the child, who was a similar age to Reoch, was pregnant by a married man until Reoch confronted her about it in front of them. After initially denying the accusation, the child pleaded with Reoch to help abort the pregnancy but she refused, telling her to ask Allan McKeldow who also declined to become involved. Less than two years later, after Reoch produced her own illegitimate child, one of the men appeared again at her bedside in her sister's house. She admitted that she had sexual intercourse with the \\"Farie man\\" after he had visited her on three nights in succession; this was the man who had been dressed in black when she first encountered them at the lochside. She claimed he was a relative named Johne Stewart, who had been fatally attacked, and that he informed her \\"he was neither dead nor alive but was forever trapped between heaven and earth\\". He told her that to retain her magic skills \\"she should henceforth be dumb\\". Reoch confessed that by using her clairvoyance skills she had foreseen a group of men at an afternoon drinking session in the house of Edmond Callendar. These men included Patrick Traill, a man who she was pregnant by, and Robert Stewart, the illegitimate son of Black Patie; they all had ropes around their necks. The prediction had been made before the Earl of Caithness arrived in Orkney. She also admitted creating a magic spell to cure illness by chanting \\"In nomine Patris, Filii, et Spiritus Sancti\\" while pulling the petals from the melefour herb between her thumb and finger. Trial In contrast to the Scottish mainland, where the Privy Council managed trials, there are no records of it having any involvement on Orkney where, from 1615, the Procurator Fiscal instigated hearings in the Sheriff Court or they were heard by the church elders. It was common for inquisitors to transcribe the word devil or demon in place of any appellation for a fairy an alleged witch may have used in their statement. The charges were brought against Reoch by Robert Coltart, the Procurator Fiscal appointed by Bishop Law. She was accused of deceiving the King's subjects with her charade of being unable to speak and committing the \\"abominable and divilesch cryme of witchcraft\\". At her trial on 12 March 1616 in Kirkwall, Reoch admitted to having had several rendezvous with the Devil, who had assumed the form of a fairy; she said one of the meetings occurred on Halloween. At one of their assignations he informed her that \\"Orkney was Priestgone, as there were too many ministers in it\\". Reoch was found guilty and executed; she was strangled and then her body was burned that afternoon.

The game was released onto Microsoft Windows and OS X on August 20, 2015, and onto iOS and Android on June 20, 2016. The game tasks players to look after a pot of succulents. The game takes on a freemium model, meaning the game is free-to- play, but contains microtransactions. Gameplay In Viridi, the player is tasked with looking after a pot full of different varieties of succulents in real-time, while a snail circumnavigates the edge of the pot. The camera angle is changed by dragging the mouse on PC or swiping on mobile. Moving the camera enables the player to view their other succulents. The succulents eventually become \\"thirsty\\", requiring the player to water them to become \\"sated\\". If watered too much, they become \\"overwatered\\" and if the watering continues, they will become \\"waterlogged\\" and will die. The player is able to sing to the succulents, resulting in faster growth. The snail can also be sang to and watered, changing its emotion from \\"wow cute\\" to something else, including \\"pleased\\", and \\"wet\\", respectively. Weeds start to grow in the pot and the player is able to remove them by clicking on them. Microtransactions are included in the game. The shop contains different species of succulents and additional pots and backdrops that the player can purchase. All of the succulents cost $0.99, but depending on the type, the quantity changes with the most being ten and the least being two. Along with the pot full of succulents awarded at the start of the game, each week, a free seedling is given to the player. Development and release Ice Water Games initially conceived Viridi as an up-front purchase, giving players access to new plants as they met goals in-game. However, fearing that this made the game \\"just another chore\\" instead of a relaxing experience, the developers changed to the free-to-play model as an alternative means of distributing plants over time. \\"People would play just to unlock the next plant,\\" explained technical lead Kevin Maxon, \\"which was antithetical to the spirit of the game: we want people to love the plant they have.\\" Viridi was released onto Steam for Microsoft Windows and OS X on August 20, 2015, and was released onto iOS and Android on June 20, 2016. Two days before the game's Steam release, on August 18, 2015, the original soundtrack became available on the Steam website as DLC. It contains 16 instrumental tracks from the game in WAV format, which were composed, performed, and mixed by Michael Bell. Reception Viridi received mixed reviews from critics. Janine Hawkins of Waypoint called it \\"a slow burn of a game as much as it is a small, meditative window to somewhere and something else.\\" Rock, Paper, Shotguns Philippa Warr was critical of the game's payment model, saying that the presence of a real-money shop interfered with Viridis purpose as a safe haven. As of 1/9/2017, it has received an overall satisfaction rating of 89% from 4,185 users on Steam, earning a \\"Very Positive\\" status. The game was also nominated for the community-created \\"Sit Back and Relax\\" award in the 2016 Steam Awards.

Among his interests were the importation of beef from Argentina as well as shipbuilding at the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, and the establishment of freight transport networks, for example, through the British and South American Steam Navigation Company.London Evening Standard, London, England: 24 Jun 1871, BRINDISI MAIL ROUTE to INDIA, CHINA, AUSTRALIA - A WEEKLY EXPRESS, via Ostend or Calais, Brussels, Cologne, Munich, and Verona (Messrs Rolt & Co.) listing Peter Rolt, Lord Alan Spencer-Churchill and Joseph Churchward (of Dover) He entered tourism through the hotel venture that was the new Imperial Hotel at Torquay.Spencer-Churchill's role in Joseph Churchward's Transatlantic mail consortium https://doverhistorian.com/2015/08/08/packet-service-part-iii-churchward- founder-of-the-packet-yard-and-politician/ Retrieved 3 November 2016The Weekly Reporter - Vol XV.

Aman works for a real estate company while Divya works in a media company. Aman is fed up of being middle-class and wants to become rich and live in luxury. He, therefore, often cheats his company to make quick money. In one such deal, he borrows money from Raghuveer (Devendra Chowhan) and invests that money to book a plot of land to build a home for himself and his wife Divya.

L. Lucas. His first novel, it was published in 1926. The title is taken from a poem by T'ao Ch'ien, translated by Arthur Waley, three lines from which form the novel's epigraph. Plot summary Written in the form of a journal with inserted letters, the story begins in early 1913, with the narrator, David Halliday (a Cambridge Classics graduate, aged 22, working on a fellowship thesis on Theocritus) holidaying happily alone in the Lake District. In Yorkshire, on his way back to Cambridge, he visits student-friend Philip Winton, for whom \\"in the odd dispassionately passionate Cambridge way\\", as one reviewer put it,H.W. in The Observer, 17 Oct. 1926 he feels a strong affection. A request by Philip's mother that he help find Philip a wife stirs in David a feeling of possessiveness. A former college friend, Hugh Fawcett, now in the Foreign Office, warns David that Philip will drain him of emotional vitality. At dinner in Cambridge with his Supervisor, Mr Dodgson, and his wife, David meets the youngest sister of Mrs D., Margaret Osborne, 25, a young woman who has just \\"perpetrated\\" a first novel, The Crystal Cabinet (\\"oh, quite shocking, my dear\\"). David reads the novel and praises it to his confidant-uncle, who notices his admiration for Margaret: :\\"If you ever fall in love, David, with a real person, don't be too prudent, too easily daunted into silence by bars of circumstance, too ready to suffer dumbly, too sure it's all no use. A real person can be trusted with the truth.\\"Lucas, F. L., The River Flows (London 1926), p. 45 Presenting Philip with the volume, David invites Margaret to meet his best friend; then regrets having no opportunity to talk to Margaret alone. He has fallen in love with her. He agonises for days over whether he should act upon it, given his uncertain circumstances. Finally, resolving to be bold, he invites her to tea alone. She does not show up. That evening, Philip tells David that he and Margaret have become engaged. A letter of apology from Margaret arrives, excusing her absence and expressing the hope that she will not come between the two friends. Full of self- contempt, David takes comfort in the fact that Margaret and Philip haven't noticed his passion. Already struggling with his thesis, he abandons it and takes reviewing work with a 'highbrow' weekly in London. He visits Philip and Margaret in Yorkshire, where he notes signs of incompatibility and basks in Margaret's company. Philip's mother is all admiration for his skills as matchmaker. The following spring (1914) David is invited to join the couple as organiser, interpreter and friend, on a tour of Greece. He knows he shouldn't go, but convinces himself he will be strong enough not to come between them. In Greece, however, with David in his element, Philip's jealousy awakens; it irritates Margaret. In a dramatic crisis near Olympia, Margaret and Philip quarrel and by bad luck are separated during a long mountain hike, Margaret being benighted with David. David confesses all. Next day, convinced that he has been betrayed (he hasn't), Philip strikes his friend and returns alone to Athens, where he attempts suicide. The attempt leaves him suffering from memory-loss, depression and a nervous possessiveness. Margaret and David, now lovers, nurse him and bring him back to England. The pair steal night meetings on the moors (the novel \\"contains a scene of love in the heather above Swaledale that was considered unusually frank for 1926\\", recalled a colleague of Lucas's at King's).Wilkinson, L. P., 'F. L. Lucas' in King's College Report, November 1967The River Flows, p.151-2 War breaks out in Europe; David, after much inward debate and discussion with friends, applies for a commission in the army. On leave from training and later from the Front, he visits Margaret and Philip in Yorkshire, the two lovers resuming the secret affair. Growing careless, one dawn they are discovered by Philip, whose memory of events at Olympia horribly returns. The lovers part for the last time. David returns to the Trenches. His journal ends abruptly in September 1915, in mid- sentence. Background Lucas did not write a World War I memoir as such, but described some of his wartime experiences in The River Flows, in Journal Under the Terror, 1938 (1939) and in autobiographical essays in The Greatest Problem, and other essays (1960).Journal Under the Terror, 1938 (1939), pp.12-19, 38-39, 95-96, 235-236, 257-259; The Greatest Problem (1960), pp.143-151; final section of The River Flows (1926), pp.166-203. Some of the events the novel is loosely based on occurred in 1919-1921 (see F. L. Lucas, Biographical), but Lucas moved them to a pre-War setting in order to conclude with the War pages (1914–15). Margaret Osborne is based on Lucas's first wife, the novelist E. B. C. Jones, Philip Winton on Sebastian Sprott (to whom the book was dedicated), Hugh Fawcett (\\"the best brain in the Foreign Office\\") on John Maynard Keynes, Mr Dodgson on Donald Robertson of the Trinity Classics department. Jones had recently written a novel, The Wedgwood Medallion (1923, the model for The Crystal Cabinet), about a similar love-triangle, while her Inigo Sandys (1924) had been, in part, about passionate male friendships at Cambridge University. Lucas had visited Greece in 1920 (with Sebastian Sprott) and in 1921 (alone), and used recollections from these visits in The River Flows. Themes The novel traces the way a scrupulous, sensitive young intellectual, diffident but proud, highly intelligent but inexperienced, is drawn by emotion into betraying the values he believes in (loyalty, unselfishness, the importance of not causing pain), while forging new ones he only half believes in ('love' and living to the full). The New Statesman called the novel \\"a candid, delicate, though not a profound study of jealousy\\".New Statesman, 5 Feb. 1927, p.506 \\"Nothing is quite so horrible as jealousy,\\" observes Margaret Osborne. \\"It attacks the best as much as the meanest; and it spoils and debases them under your eyes.\\"The River Flows, p.199 The novel is also notable for its admission – not so common in War memoirs of the 1920s – of the \\"strange repellent fascination\\" of war. \\"Squalor, foulness, utter boredom – yet at instants this strange repellent fascination, that seized me the moment I set eyes on Fricourt and Mametz and the great heave of the gaunt uplands of the Somme. And I abandon myself to it when it comes, as to some turbid, heady wine. There is poison in the dregs, and the cold dread of death. Yet it intoxicates. This insignificant 'I' loses itself for a moment in a grapple of empires, the agony of a world.\\"The River Flows, p.197-8 Reception While praising the power and beauty of the scenes in Greece, several reviewers found the form of a confessional-diary with inserted love-letters improbable, and the book as a whole \\"young\\". Desmond MacCarthy in the New Statesman, however, reminded them that that was the whole point,New Statesman, 5 Feb. 1927, p.506 and indeed the narrator, looking at his early diary entries with hindsight, admits as much.The River Flows, p.178 L. P. Hartley in the Saturday Review found the characters too rational and analytical: \\"they ask for and need no interpretation from us\\" and have within them \\"no force of unexplored, unreasoning life\\";The Saturday Review, 13 Nov. 1926, p.592 while Edwin Muir in The Nation and Athenaeum felt that though the narrator's thoughts were set down with passion, \\"the desires which colour them are never sufficiently realised\\".Nation and Athenaeum, 23 Oct. 1926, p.118 The Times Literary Supplement believed that Lucas had developed \\"to an unnecessary extent the personal views of the narrator\\".The Times Literary Supplement, 14 Oct. 1926, p.694 Nevertheless, it noted, \\"The book sheds a not uninteresting light on the Cambridge scene\\".The Times Literary Supplement, 14 Oct. 1926, p.694 Admirers of the novel included T. E. Lawrence, who found that \\"Parts of the book come back to my memory without warning at odd times as I lie about brooding. The Greece part, especially. You get a tense effect out of quite simple words,\\" he wrote to Lucas. \\"Somehow actual sentences have stuck to me\\".Lawrence, T. E., letter to Lucas, in Wilson, Jeremy, & Wilson, Nicole, eds., T. E. Lawrence, Correspondence with E. M. Forster and F. L. Lucas (2010), p.265 Lucas dedicated his next novel, Cécile (1930), to Lawrence. Publishing history T. S. Eliot, as literary editor of Faber and Gwyer, hearing that Lucas had written a novel, wrote to him offering to look at it with a view to publication.The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Vol. 2, 1923-1925; Letter, 31 Dec. 1925 The sequel to this offer is not known. The novel was published by the Hogarth Press, London, in October 1926 – Lucas was a friend of the Woolfs – and reprinted later in the same month,Woolmer, J. Howard, and Gaither, Mary E., A Checklist of the Hogarth Press, 1917-38 (London 1976) and by the Macmillan Company, New York, 1926 (reprinted by Macaulay Co., New York, 1926).

It has smooth, greyish bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and more or less spherical fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus cyclostoma is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and has a lignotuber. It has whitish-grey-cream, brown and pinkish grey coloured bark that is flaky to ribbony can be rough or smooth. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same dull, bluish green on both surfaces, lance-shaped, long and wide with a base that tapers to the petiole and a pointed apex. It blooms between February and April and produces white flowers. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between seven and eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are cylindrical to pear- shaped with a beaked operculum with inflexed stamens and oblong anthers. The fruits that form after flowering are shaped like a truncated sphere long and wide on a pedicel long. The fruit has three or four valves at about the level of the rim. The brown seeds inside have a flattened ovoid shape and a length of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Ian Brooker in 1981 in the journal Brunonia from a specimen he collected west of Balladonia in 1970. The specific epithet (cyclostoma) is derived from the Ancient Greek words kyklos meaning \\"circle\\" or \\"ring\\" and stoma meaning \\"mouth\\" in reference to the marked rim of the fruit. Eucalyptus cyclostoma is part of the subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Dumaria in a sub-group of nine closely related species in the series Ovulares. The other members of this series include the smooth barked E. cylindrocarpa, E. exigua and E. oraria, and the rough barked E. ovularis, E. aequioperta, E. brachycorys, E. myriadena and E. baudiniana. Distribution This eucalypt is found on limestone plains on the south western Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia growing in sandy loam or red sand soils. It has a limited range around Balladonia and Zanthus where it forms part of low woodland communities.

Built in two parts (1896 and 1905), it is a reminder of the city's railroad-related history, and served for many years as an enduring commercial presence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The former Giroux Furniture Company Building is located in central St. Albans, on a block bounded by Market, Lake, and Catherine Streets. It is set directly Lake Street from the Central Vermont Railway Office building, and across Market Street from the main railroad tracks. The front portion of the building is triangular in shape, an artifact of the historic alignment of Market Street, which angled toward Federal Street east of the railway office. It is two stories in height, built out of wood frame faced in brick veneer. A single-story showroom facade is built along the angled side of the building. To the rear of the triangular section is a large two-story warehouse of similar construction. with The rear warehouse portion of the building was built in 1896 by Hiram Weeks, who operated a feed store. He chose the location to efficiently move large volumes of goods from the railroad tracks to the west into the building, and then move smaller (but still large) quantities of goods to his customers on the east side. The feed business, eventually renamed or sold to City Feed Company, remained on the premises until 1936, adding the front triangular section in 1905. This addition was made to provide space for a vehicle repair business operated by Frederick Bedard and Henry Carlisle. In 1937 the building was acquired by the Giroux brothers, who opened what they claimed was Vermont's largest furniture retailer, also capitalizing on the presence of the nearby railroad for delivery of their goods. The Giroux Furniture Company closed in the 2000s, after nearly 70 years of operation.

History and classification O. paleomyagra is known from a single ant found in the Czech Republic.Wappler et al pg.495 The specimen was described from a compression fossil preserved in lignite deposits of the Most Basin. The site is exposed in workings of the Bílina Mine, an opencast lignite mine in Bílina, Bohemia, Czech Republic. The mine exposes an approximately thick sequence of deposits recording the progression of a delta lake and bog ecosystem.Kvacek et al pg.4–5 Fossils of elevenKvacek et al pg.8 different insect orders are recorded in the Bílina site, representing members of 31 different insect families, with formicids being the most common insects, being nearly 40% of the specimens collected.Wappler et al pg.497 Over the lifetime of the lake, the Bílina area was a delta region of a large drainage system emptying into a shallow lake, with expansive peat bogs surrounding it. There are several different fish and at least one frog from the genus Rana also known from the Bílina mine area that may have fed on the ants that fell into the lake. The low bog forest where O. paleomyagra lived had a mix of temperate plants such as alders, oaks and swamp cypress along with more tropical plants such as climbing fern, palmetto and rattan palms.Kvacek et al pg.13–14 Odontomachus assiniensis worker O. paleomyagra head The fossil was studied by a team of paleoentomologists led by Torsten Wappeler, with the group's 2014 type description of the new species being published in the journal Paläontologische Zeitschrift. The specific epithet paleomyagra is a combination of the Greek words for \\"ancient\\", \\"mouse\\", and \\"trap\\".Wappler et al pg.498 When first described, O. paleomyagra was one of three Odontomachus species that had been described from fossils, with both Odontomachus pseudobauri and Odontomachus spinifer being described in 1994 from fossils found in Dominican amber. Both Dominican amber species are placed in the Odontomachus haematodus species group, which is neotropical in distribution. O. paleomyagra is distinct from haematodus group species in the less complex mandible dentition, and in the shape of the head.Wappler et al pg.499 The simpler mandibles of O. paleomyagra are closer to those of the extant south-east African species Odontomachus assiniensis and to the south-east Asian species group rixosus, including Odontomachus rixosus, Odontomachus monticola, and Odontomachus latidens. Unlike these species however, O. paleomyagra has a shorter more squared off head, rather than the elongated heads of the modern species. Description The O. paleomyagra queen is estimated to have been long in life, and the fossil has a total preserved length of . The head is nearly square in outline, being only 1.2 times longer than wide, with slightly bowed-in sides, rear corners which are rounded, and the rear edge which is concave. The front region of the head has distinct striations and the small oval eyes are placed notably close to the front edge of the head. There is little constriction of the head to the rear of the eyes, with the width across the eyes 1.06 time the width across the vertex of the head. In front of the clypeus, the bases of the long straight mandibles are placed close together. On the masticatory margin there are no denticles, with possibly three teeth present at the tip end of each mandible, though only two are visible. The thorax is slightly elongated, with a mesoscutum that is a little wider than long and attaching with no overhang of the sclerites to the propodeum. The petiole is rounded and narrow, without a spine on the upper surface.

In its earlier days it was made from port wine with the addition of extracts of coca leaf, kola nut and beef. From around 1923 its only advertised additive was the kola extract. The brand name was later used in Australia for a similar product, locally produced. History Sedna was first manufactured by Snaed Manufacturing Company (later Deans, Logan & Co. Ltd.), of 16 Commercial Court, Belfast, and went on sale in 1897. In 1898 the company had secured 10 outlets, which had grown to 100 in 1899. It has been suggested the brand name was chosen as \\"Andes\\" (source of the coca extract) spelled backwards, but it may be significant that both \\"Sedna\\" and \\"Snaed\\" are anagrams of \\"Deans\\". Alex Deans was a principal of the company, and uncle of George Deans (1875–1938), head of Charles Moore and Co.'s Perth, Western Australia, emporium. The company was in the hands of a liquidator in 1932. Australia Sedna was from 1908 imported into Australia and marketed by the Seppelts wine company. The trade ran both ways – Deans and Logan marketed Australian wines in Britain. In New Zealand it was classed as a \\"tonic\\" and only sold in chemist's shops, while in Australia it was classed as an alcoholic beverage and legally sold only in licensed premises. In 1920 two Rundle Street, Adelaide businesses were fined for selling the product: Foy & Gibson (a major department store), and Birks Chemists. Chemists in country areas were convicted of sale of Sedna and Maltox (a similar product made by Bickford's), evidence being produced by police \\"sting operations\\". Outrageous behaviour by persons who became inebriated on the tonic has been ascribed to the cocaine and caffeine content of Sedna. After 1923 advertisements no longer mentioned coca and beef in advertisements for the product, kola remaining an essential ingredient. At some stage Sedna sold in Australia was locally produced by the Seppeltsfield company, and it is likely but by no means certain that Seppelts purchased rights to the brand name from Deans & Logan's liquidators c. 1932. Later bottles are clearly marked \\"PRODUCE OF AUSTRALIA\\", and the product has been identified by wine writer Philip White as based on Grenache port from the Para vineyard. It was sold in 750ml bottles and had an alcoholic content 33% proof. It has been reported as containing 15 grains per fluid ounce (around 30g/litre) of kola nut powder, This reference is alone in giving Sedna a cinchona extract (quinine) component (c. 10ml/litre). perhaps 60 mg/100 ml of caffeine. (Red Bull contains 32 mg/100 ml). Marketing of Sedna in Australia ceased some time after 1950. Early postcards advertising the product appear to be quite collectible and are advertised for sale at prices between $50 and $100. It has no connection to the wine made in the Napa Valley AVA or the vodka made in Newfoundland.

The park covers an area of about . Most of the park is in Novo Mundo but part of the extreme west of the park is in Alta Floresta. Its shape is roughly rectangular, extending east-west and north-south. The park is on the border of the \\"arc of deforestation\\" in the Amazon rainforest. In the north it borders the Brazilian Airforce base in Pará, which contains a large area of native vegetation. The state park is surrounded by farms to the west, east and south. The Cristalino River enters the park from Pará to the north, then flows westward through the park below the Pará border before turning south and flowing to the Teles Pires in the southwest. The Serra do Mateiro is in the west of the park. The Rochedo River rises in the east of the park, flowing through the Serra do Rochedo on the park's south boundary. The Nhandú River defines the eastern boundary of the park. The park is accessible by water via the Teles Pires River to the mouth of the Cristalino River, then up that river through the park. The park can also be reached by the unpaved Quarta Leste road from the municipal center of Alta Floresta, taking a ferry across the Teles Pires River. The road runs through the park as far as the Cristalino River. Another dirt road from the Primeira Leste highway runs parallel to the boundary with Pará to the Cristalino River. Unofficial roads opened by ranchers and loggers enter the eastern end of the park, but do not reach the Cristalino River basin. SEMA has a station for researchers and students, including a house with four bedrooms, one bathroom and a power generator. Environment The climate is hot and humid, with annual average temperatures over and average annual rainfall above . There is a dry season from May to September with monthly total rainfall is less than . The park is in the ecotone or transition zone between Amazon rainforest and cerrado. The reserve would be in the proposed South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor. Vegetation includes rainforest, seasonal forest, campinarana, rocky fields and pioneer fluvial or lacustrine formations. 515 species of birds have been recorded, with 55 endemic species, 43 of reptiles, 29 of amphibians, 36 of mammals and 16 fish species with commercial or sports value. Ecotourism, including observation of wildlife and hiking, generates some income and may help encourage sustainable environmental development in the surrounding area. However, the park has been threatened since the time of its creation with land clearance for cattle pasture, illegal logging and construction of infrastructure such as small hydroelectric plants. Little has been done to prevent damage to the environment, and there is lack of local community support for the park. Threats include illegal logging, which has steadily advanced north into the park, family agriculture producing annual crops such as rice and beans, and cattle farming. Legal history The Cristalino State Park was created on 9 June 2000. It had an initial area of . Objectives were to preserve animals and native species of trees threatened with extinction. The Cristalino II State Park was created by decree 2.628 of 30 May 2001. These two contiguous parks together have an area of . The park is administered by the State Department of the Environment (SEMA).

She was recognised by her research regarding Roman Imperial coins and as \\"a living link with the pioneers of archaeological research\\".  Early life and education  Anne Strachan Robertson was born in Glasgow on 3 May 1910. Her parents, Margaret Purden and John Anderson Robertson, were both school teachers. She was educated in Glasgow at Hillhead High School and the Glasgow High School for Girls. In 1928 she attended the University of Glasgow, where she was impressed by the work and teachings of S.N. Miller relating to Roman history. In 1930 Robertson won the Cowan Medal and she obtained the approval of Sir George Macdonald, then Honorary Keeper of the Hunterian Coin Cabinet. After graduating with a Master of Arts with Honours in Classics in 1932, she started her studies for a second MA, this time in archaeology, at the University of London. In London, she obtained different scholarships to participate in Mortimer Wheeler's excavations, to work at the Coin Room of the British Museum, and to several academic papers on numismatics. She graduated in 1934, having acquired considerable experience in archaeological methods, particularly as result of her participation in Wheeler's excavation of Maiden Castle.  Career  Robertson returned to Glasgow in 1936 when she was appointed Dalrymple Lecturer in Archaeology. In 1938, she joined the staff of the University of Glasgow involved in the curation of the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery. In 1952 she became Under (Deputy) Keeper of the Museum. In 1964 she was appointed Keeper of Cultural Collections, and was promoted to Reader in archaeology at the University in the same year. In 1974 she was given the honorary title of Professor and became the Keeper of Roman Archaeology at the museum. She was President of the Glasgow Archaeological Society from 1954 to 1957, having been vice-president from 1945 to 1954. Following her presidency, Robertson served as Honorary Secretary of the Society from 1965 to 1972. A special issue of the Glasgow Archaeological Journal was published in her honour in 1976 \\"in gratitude for her outstanding services to scholarship - specifically, to the study of Roman Scotland - and to the Glasgow Archaeological Society\\". She served on the Council of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland from 1946, and was the first woman to be elected to Council. Robertson was a prolific excavator of Roman sites, notably Castledykes near Lanark (1937), Duntocher on the Antonine Wall (1947–51), Birrens in Dumfriesshire (1962-7), and Cardean in Angus (1968–75). She was Secretary of the Scottish Field School of Archaeology from 1948 to 1973.  Honours  Robertson became a Fellow of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1937, and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1941. Robertson was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1958. Robertson was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1975 (FRSE). Her proposers were Alex Haddow, Robert Alexander Rankin, Stuart Piggott, Sheina Marshall, Edward McGirr and Agnes Miller. She was elected to an Honorary Membership of the Glasgow Archaeological Society in 1976. In 1964, she was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society, followed by the Huntington Medal from the American Numismatic Society in 1970.

The three Teenagers were converts from the indigenous traditions of their families to the Roman Catholic faith and received their educations from the Order of Friars Minor who baptized them and evangelized in the area. Their activism and evangelical zeal led to their deaths at the hands of those who detested their newfound faith and perceived them as dangers to their values and rituals. The teenagers were beatified in Mexico in mid-1990 by Pope John Paul II. Pope Francis – on 23 March 2017 – issued a decree that the three teenagers would be canonized without having a miracle attributed to their intercession as is the norm. The teenagers were canonized as saints on 15 October 2017.Pope Francis canonizes the martyred children of Tlaxcala Life Image in Mexico of the three children. The primary source for the life of the Tlaxcalan Child Martyrs is Toribio Benavente Motolinia who described their life in 1539, with later texts in Nahuatl by Juan Bautista.Haskett, R. (2008). Dying for conversion: Faith, obedience, and the Tlaxcalan boy martyrs in New Spain. Colonial Latin American Review, 17(2), 185-212. Cristobal Cristobal was born either in 1514 or in 1515 as the son to an indigenous leader. He was considered the heir of his father Acxotécatl. He had three brothers: Bernardino and Luis in addition to one whose name is unknown. His mother was Tlapaxilotzin – she was Acxotécatl's first wife before the latter married Xochipapalotzin. He converted to Roman Catholicism and received his education in Tlaxcala from the Order of Friars Minor – at their first school – who baptized him and instilled in him deep religious values and practices. The Franciscan brother Motolinia often called him \\"Cristobalito\\" – translated as \\"little Christopher.\\" His father did not want to send Cristobal – his favorite son – to the Franciscan school but was convinced to do so when the Franciscans and Cristobal's brothers persuaded him to do so. His father did not give much importance to Cristobal's spirit of evangelism – which was constant and persuasive – but could tolerate it no longer when his son starting breaking indigenous religious symbols in their home. He first forgave Cristobal but grew infuriated and planned to murder him. His stepmother also did not like his evangelism and pressured her husband to do something drastic to stop it. Acxotécatl planned a feast for the household and ordered all his sons to be present before sending them – at one point – out of the room to be with Cristobal alone. His father grabbed his hair and dragged him along the floor and kicked him. He horsewhipped him with a thick holm oak club until his son's arms and legs were broken which caused profuse bleeding. It became clear to him that Cristobal would not renounce his faith and revert to the indigenous values, so he took Cristobal and burned him over a bonfire. Cristobal died the next morning from his grievous injuries in 1527 after calling out to his father and expressing his forgiveness. Acxotécatl also killed Cristobal's mother when she tried in vain to defend her son. His father buried his remains in a room of the house where it might not be discovered but he was soon apprehended for the murder and the Spaniards sentenced him to death for the crime. In 1528 the Franciscan friar Andrea found his remains and had them exhumed for formal interment elsewhere. Antonio and Juan Antonio was born either in 1516 or in 1517 as the grandson of the noble Xiochténacti and was considered his heir being the first grandson. He converted to the Roman Catholic faith and began to detest the native rituals of the indigenous peoples including his own. Antonio served as an able interpreter for the Franciscans in the area. Antonio and his servant Juan were caught desecrating indigenous religious effigies and were murdered in 1529 when the locals caught them. Antonio came out of the room to find Juan dead and asked the attackers the reason Juan was targeted and not Antonio – the teen admitted he was the one desecrating the effigies and died when the attackers in turn attacked him. Juan was born either in 1516 or in 1517 and was of humble origins; he too converted to Roman Catholicism and worked as Antonio's servant. Juan died alongside Antonio in 1529 and died as soon as the club struck him. The bodies of both teenagers were thrown off a cliff but the Dominican friar Bernardino recovered them and moved them to Tepeaca to be interred. Canonization The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 7 January 1982 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled the three teenagers as Servants of God. A cognitional process was held in the Diocese of Tlaxcala that Bishop Luis Munive Escobar oversaw; the C.C.S. later validated this process on 8 November 1985 and historians approved the cause on 8 November 1985 after deeming no historical obstacles existed to impede the cause. The postulation sent the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 1989 which allowed for theologians to approve its contents on 24 November 1989 and the C.C.S. to do so as well on 6 February 1990. Pope John Paul II – on 3 March 1990 – confirmed that the three teenagers were killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) and beatified them on 6 May 1990 on his apostolic visit to Mexico in the capital of Mexico City.AMERICA/MEXICO - The child martyrs of Tlaxcala declared Patrons of Mexican childhood It had been reported that the three teenagers could be proclaimed as saints either in 2017 or in 2018 since the cause was in its \\"advantaged stages\\" according to Cardinal Angelo Amato in a meeting with the postulation. The cardinal also expressed that Pope Francis was monitoring the cause and had expressed his own closeness to this particular cause. The 30 C.C.S. members met to approve the cause on 14 March 2017 before passing it to the pope for approval; Pope Francis approved the canonization without the required miracle on 23 March 2017 thus confirming the three teenagers would be canonized. The date was formalized at a gathering of cardinals on 20 April and the children were canonized as saints on 15 October 2017. The postulator for the cause at the time of their canonization was the Franciscan Giovangiuseppe Califano.

He distinctly specialized in sociology and anthropology. For a short period of time he became a professor at Kent State and at Western Michigan Universities. Even with all of the other sociologists back then, Lemert was able to view how most of the social acts are viewed as deviant acts. While studying drug addiction, he admired a powerful force at work. Beside the physical changes due to the addiction and all of the economic issues it can cause, there was an immense process of learning one's identity and justifying every action, \\"I do these things because I am this way.\\" Activities such as drinking and/or shoplifting do not reflect on an individual's personality. Lemert once wrote: \\"His acts are repeated and organized subjectively and transformed into active roles and become the social criteria for assigning status.....When a person begins to employ his deviant behavior or a role based on it as a means of defense, attack, or adjustment to the overt and covert problems created by the consequent societal reaction to him, his deviation is secondary\\".

This means that the ratio of brightness of the emission line to the brightness of the nearby continuum decreases with increasing luminosity of the continuum.  Discovery and observations  The effect was discovered in observations of high-redshift quasars reported in 1977, and has been commonly named after the discoverer Jack Allen Baldwin, an astronomer at Lick Observatory. It was found that the equivalent width of the broad ultraviolet C IV (λ 1549) emission line, caused by the presence of thrice ionised carbon C3+, decreased with increasing continuum luminosity of the source. For flat-spectrum, radio-loud quasars the relation W_\\\\lambda \\\\propto L^{-2/3} was found. The same effect has been observed for other spectral lines such as the Ly-α hydrogen line and the C III] (λ 1909) line of twice ionised carbon. It has also been found for spectral lines in the infrared range, e.g. in several Seyfert galaxies.  Explanation  More or less satisfactory explanations of the phenomenon have been attempted using photoionization models, continuum beaming, variability, or continuum shape. An adequate, but not exclusive explanation is offered as a consequence of the presence of massive accretion disks in the centres of active galaxies and quasars. However, a complete explanation is still outstanding.

She paints in oil on stretched rectangular canvases of varying size. By means of close observation of everyday subjects--leaves of a tree seen through a window, a section of floor tiles, an old fashioned light fixture-- she makes, as one critic says, \\"quiet, abstract manifestations of observed realities.\\" She is a studio artist who paints not what she sees in an instant but rather what she observes continuously, day after day. The result, she says, is not so much temporal as durational. Her paintings compress many instances of observation so as to become, as she sees it, \\"a parallel system to a lived experience.\\" The paintings lack spatial orientation and, as a critic says, can \\"be described as both highly realistic and abstract without compromising either term.\\" In 2008, Alan G. Artner, writing in the Chicago Tribune, said \\"This is work of small refinements and adjustments. The world of everyday things generates it, but Fish's qualities of seeing and touch elevate the things to a plane on which they leave behind their humble character.\\" Early life and training In 1950 Fish was born on the Oregon coast in the small community of Toledo . She has said that her parents, who refused to have a television in their house, guided her to develop an early interest in reading, drawing, and music. She attended the Museum Art School of the Pacific Northwest College of Art in Portland, Oregon, and there obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1976. She later praised the high quality of that school's teachers, the intensity of its classes, and a prevailing atmosphere which encouraged close interaction among its students. After graduating from PNCA she crossed the continent to attend the Mount Royal School of Art within the Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland, obtaining a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1982. Career=Iowa, 1982-1985 Between 1982 and 1985 Fish was a visiting artist and assistant professor of painting and drawing at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. During her student years she had made large, abstract paintings. After the move to Iowa, her work became smaller and less abstract. She has said that, in part, she felt an emotional connection with to the landscape paintings of John Frederick Kensett, Martin Johnson Heade, and Albert Pinkham Ryder. In 1984 Fish was given a solo exhibition called \\"Drawings 1976 -1984\\" at Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon. That year she also participated in a faculty exhibition at the University of Iowa Museum of Art and in the late 1970s and early 1980s her work appeared in group shows at Mount Hood Community College (in 1978 with Esther Podemski); the Hallie Ford Museum of Art; Willamette University (\\"Oregon Women Artists\\" 1979); Linfield College, McMinnville, Oregon (\\"Current Concerns\\" 1983); and the Meyerhoff Gallery in the Maryland Institute College of Art (\\"Ten Years, Mount Royal School of Painting\\" 1985). Chicago1985-1990= In 1985 Fish moved to Chicago. At that time or sometime during the previous few years she married the sculptor, Richard Rezac. Like her, he was a graduate of PNCA (B.F.A. 1974) and MICA (M.F.A. 1982). That year she showed in commercial galleries for the first time: an invitational show at a gallery called Feature, Inc. concurrent with a group exhibition at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery, both in Chicago. In 1986 she participated in a dual exhibition at Feature, Inc. along with her husband and in two other group shows, one at the Hyde Park Art Center and the other at the Robbin Lockett Gallery. The name of the last of these shows, \\"Abstracted Landscapes,\\" indicates the nature of her paintings at this time. A critic called them \\"reticent pieces,\\" free of bombast, that were \\"romantic, hazy, and soft-edged in form\\" and said they were not so much landscapes as the memoir of landscapes. Fish's work appeared again at the Robbin Lockett Gallery in one solo (1987) and two group shows (1988 and 1991). At the time of her 1988 appearance at this gallery a critic said Fish was one of the fortunate few among Chicago artists who was able to sell all that she exhibited and had a waiting list of collectors willing to buy. The wait might be a long one since Fish worked slowly. In 1987 Fish participated in the inaugural exhibition of José Freire's Fiction/Nonfiction Gallery in Manhattan's East Village, her first appearance in a New York gallery. Since that early appearance Fish has frequently exhibited in Manhattan galleries including the Loughelton Gallery (solo,1988 and 1989), the Amy Lipton Gallery (solo 1992), the Lipton-Owens Company (solo, 1995), Feigen Contemporary (group 1998, solo 1999), the Hollis Taggart Galleries (group 2015), and the David Nolan Gallery (solo 2015, group 2016). In 1988 Fish described the slow process by which most of her work evolved. She said, \\"It's very unusual that I'll see something, go to the studio, draw it and paint it. That rarely happens. I'll see it and it will stay in my head for a while, and maybe later I'll try to figure out through drawing what I saw. But sometimes it's a delay of two months, or four or six. That's part of the distilling, getting a sense of what's literal there, what's tangible and intangible, what's abstract and some other kind of order.\\" In 1989 Fish contributed a painting called \\"Rock\\" in her first museum exhibition in Chicago. Held by the Renaissance Society, the show paired one piece from each of twenty-three artists with one of the Date paintings by the Japanese artist On Kawara. She participated in other Renaissance Society group shows in 1994 and 1996, and was given a solo exhibition in 2015 (discussed below). =1990-2000= Julia Fish, Entry (Fragment One) Negative, 1998, Oil on linen, 11½ x 20½ inchesIn the early 1990s Fish began making small paintings of objects in her immediate environment generally showing a section rather than the entire unit. These subjects included part of a brick wall, the winter sky seen through a window, hexagonal tiles on a bathroom floor, and tar paper siding on a neighboring building. A reviewer said, \\"There is something comforting, and charismatically fascinating in staring at these familiar patterns.\\" Of this new work she said, \\"I encounter the subjects continually so they become extremely familiar, though I don't work from observation. I don't place the canvas next to the window and paint what's outside. I don't look at the subject and paint at the same time. So there's memory and recollection in the work, but time is telescoped.\\" The floor tile paintings appeared on canvas in the exact dimensions of the original. To make them she would first trace a section of tile for use as template for a painting that would follow. Quoting Walter Benjamin's comment that \\"to dwell means to leave traces,\\" she said she wished such traces of personal presence to manifest themselves in her paintings . By 1999 she thought the floor tile project, which she called Entry, was completed. On a trip to Vienna, however, she gave close examination to the exterior of the Portois-Fix Palace designed by the architect, Max Fabiani and discovered in its facade a constantly shifting visual experience. Drawing on this discovery she made a series she called Entry (borders and corners) in 2000. Julia Fish, Entry (Fragment Two), 1998, oil on canvas, 17½ x 16½ inchesIn 1996 the Renaissance Society mounted a solo retrospective of her work in the decade from 1985 to 1995. The exhibition's thirty-five paintings and drawings documented her transition from atmospheric subjects--such as rain or sky--and natural objects--such as leaves or rocks--to closely observed elements within and near to the prosaic urban building where she lived. She usually retained the color of the subject, rendering it in subdued hues and subtly enhancing it in multiple thin layers of paint. In both the earlier choice of subjects and the newer one Fish used \\"abstraction,\\" as she said, \\"to purify or distill an image.\\" Her paintings usually have recognizable subjects but give no illusion of depth. They are abstract in the sense that the viewer tends to concentrate on the surface of the canvas, its weave and the pigment upon it. She achieved an elusive balance between the exact transcription of the objects she so closely observed and the abstraction of those objects on the painting's surface. She said she aimed to recast her subjects so that they retained all their properties but also incorporated her understanding of abstraction. In addition to the Renaissance Society retrospective Fish contributed works to group and solo exhibitions at a large number museums and private galleries during the 1990s. These included the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University (group, 1990), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (groups, 1990, 1991, 1996, 1998), the Christopher Grimes Gallery, Santa Monica (group, 1992, and solo, 1993, 1995, 1998), three German galleries (group, Berlinische Galerie 1994; group, Galerie Klaus Fischer 1997; group, KunstMitte Berlin/Galerie Klaus Fischer, Berlin 1998), as well as commercial galleries in Chicago and New York. =2000-current= While continuing to choose her subjects from her immediate urban environment, Fish changed her approach roughly at the turn of the century. Closely observed objects such as sections of floor tile and asphalt siding gave way to abstractly rendered thresholds, stairs and stair landings, a light fixture, and floor plans of rooms in her home. Like her earlier work, these paintings, she said, were impressed on the surface of the canvas in a way that approximated the experience of seeing the same things over and over, day after day. She came to see transitions as the subject of her work, the sense of walking across a threshold, moving from room to room; or the sense of light moving through a room during the day and into it from a wall fixture at night. She understood such transitions to be both actual and metaphorical. The visual elements she put on her canvases were meant to convey physical objects but also her own motion through the spaces they represented and the light that came from fixtures in the rooms and through the windows. The result could be seen, as one reviewer said, \\"as a thoughtful meditation on the nature of occupancy within a domestic environment, exactingly rendered in multiple paint layers.\\" Detail (bottom right) from: Julia Fish, Threshold, NorthWest—One (spectrum: violet with grey), 2010-2011, 2014, oil on canvas, 23 x 38 inchesShe said her Living Rooms project evolved from her examination of Fabiani's architecture both in Vienna and other cities. When she and her husband took possession of the building in Chicago that was their home they were given a set of floor plans for the structure. The plans and inspiration from Fabiani led to a series of drawings and paintings she created during the decade from 2001 to 2011. She made all the paintings at the same time, keeping them in view on the walls of her studio as her ideas evolved during the period of their creation. Each is one seventh the size of the room it represents and all are abstracted dramatically by elimination of elements in the plans from which she worked and by inclusion of shapes that denote motion and light. Her intention was to use these marks to convey life as she experienced it in the rooms. Describing them as \\"acrobatic,\\" she aimed to activate the marks in the eye of the observer. While working on the Living Rooms series, she also made a series called Stairs and Landings (2006-2007, 2009) and Thresholds (2009-2015) as well as a set of drawings and paintings of a light fixture (2014-2015). Of the two latter sets one reviewer said, \\"Only by prolonged looking do you become aware of how masterful Fish is in coaxing paint to evoke something as ephemeral as a light fixture seen in the dark or the striations of light seen on a floor connecting one part of the house to another.\\" Fish has participated in many group and solo shows from 2000 onward including eight appearances in group shows at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and four at the Art Institute of Chicago. Her work appeared in three group and two solo exhibitions at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago, and one group and one solo at the David Nolan Gallery in New York. In 2010 the Illinois State University College of Fine Arts gave Fish a retrospective exhibition of studies and drawings from 1996 onward. She also showed three Threshold paintings in the 2010 Whitney Biennial. In 2015, a reviewer said of her recent work, \\"It is this quality of scrutiny — of looking with such focused intensity that the commonplace things in the world become mysterious — that I find compelling. Fish is able to revisit the familiar in paint so that it moves closer to its original state of incomprehensibility.\\"  Exhibitions  ;Solo exhibitions *Julia Fish: bound by spectrum, DePaul Art Museum, Chicago, IL, 2019 Books, monographs and catalogs *Fish: bound by spectrum, (exhibition catalog), contributions from Julie Rodrigues Widholm, Kate Nesin, Dan Wheeler and Colm Tóibín, 2019 NotesReferences Category:1950 births Category:Painters from Oregon Category:21st-century American painters Category:American women painters Category:American contemporary painters Category:Maryland Institute College of Art alumni Category:Pacific Northwest College of Art alumni Category:Art educators Category:Living people Category:People from Lincoln County, Oregon Category:21st-century American women artists ","title":"Julia Fish"},{"id":"52159014","text":"Ganapavaram mandal is one of the 48 mandals in West Godavari district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

They are threatened by various human activities. Geography The succulent woodlands are found in the southwest and centre-west of Madagascar, in the rain shadow region that receives less moisture than the east and the Central Highlands. The climate is tropical and dry, with rainfall ranging from 575 to 1,330 mm per year, and a marked dry season from May to October. To the north, the succulent woodlands make a transition into the Madagascar dry deciduous forests, while to the south, they border the even drier Madagascar spiny thickets and to the east, the Madagascar subhumid forests. Flora The vegetation is similar to the dry deciduous forests to the north, but includes more dry-adapted, xerophytic species. Forests, reaching in height, contain trees and shrubs of the families Burseraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, and Sapindaceae. Notable endemics include two species of baobab, Adansonia za and A. grandidieri (near threatened and endangered, respectively), and succulents in the genus Pachypodium. Fauna Between 60 and 90 bird species and eight lemur species are found in the ecoregion and a number of mammals, frogs, and reptiles are endemic to the area. A notable lemur species is the endangered Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate. Threats and conservation The Madagascar succulent woodlands are threatened by burning, logging (which impacts species such as the endemic tree Hazomalania voyroni), cattle and goat farming, and hunting of several mammals.

Early life Johnson was born in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, and spent his formative years in Worsbrough. He was educated at The Kingstone School and Barnsley College. Johnson studied Geography at the University of Leeds, followed by a postgraduate diploma in Broadcast Journalism at City, University of London. Career in journalism Johnson began his career with the BBC in 2008 as a journalist for BBC Radio Sheffield, moving to television in 2011 when he joined the newsroom as a reporter for BBC Look North. His recent time at the BBC has been controversial. Johnson has been criticised for pursuing headline grabbing stories which are based on dubious sources. Media commentators have claimed that his research methods are impact driven, rather than evidence based. Mr. Justice Mann, in his judgement against the BBC, described Johnson as \\"capable of letting his enthusiasm for his story get the better of his complete regard for truth on occasions\\". Battle of Orgreave In October 2012, Johnson investigated the events at the 1984 Battle of Orgreave, and the trials which arose from it, for BBC One regional news and current affairs programme, Inside Out: Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The programme examined the evidence that senior officers with South Yorkshire Police (SYP) had conspired to co-ordinate statements to wrongly charge arrested miners with riot, an offence which at the time carried a punishment of life imprisonment. Following the broadcast, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the House of Commons that the issue needed to be investigated, and SYP referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The subsequent IPCC investigation concluded that there was \\"evidence of excessive violence by police officers, a false narrative from police exaggerating violence by miners, perjury by officers giving evidence to prosecute the arrested men, and an apparent coverup of that perjury by senior officers.\\" Previously, Johnson had been the principal researcher for David Hencke and Francis Beckett's Marching to the Fault Line: The Miners' Strike and the Battle for Industrial Britain (2009). Cliff Richard property search In July 2014, Johnson was alerted by a source that Cliff Richard was being covertly investigated by South Yorkshire Police (SYP) over an alleged historical offence of sexual assault. On 14 July, he contacted Carrie Goodwin, SYP's communications director, and detailed the information he had received. Chief Constable David Crompton said: \\"We were placed in a very difficult position because of the original leak and the BBC came to us knowing everything that we knew, as far as the investigation was concerned.\\" Contrary to established procedures, under which Johnson's disclosure of the leak \\"should have been treated as a critical incident and should have triggered a Gold Group [a meeting led by the Association of Chief Police Officers] under a Chief Officer to determine the next steps\\", the police controversially struck a deal with Johnson and the BBC giving them exclusive access to, and insider knowledge of, the investigation. This led to the BBC having a news crew and helicopter in position at Richard's home in Berkshire to provide live news coverage as the police commenced a raid on the property on 14 August 2014, and extraordinary contact between Johnson and SYP's press officer. Johnson received a text alerting him that the police were \\"Going in now, Dan\\", to which he replied \\"Give me a shout before they take anything out, so we can get the chopper in place for a shot.\\" Awards *The Guardian Student Media Awards – Runner up, Student Feature Writer of the Year 2006; Runner up, Diversity Writer of the Year 2006. *Royal Television Society Awards (Yorkshire) – Most Promising Newcomer 2012. *Royal Television Society Awards (Yorkshire) – Regional Factual Programme 2013; News Coverage 2013; Runner up, Journalist of the Year 2013. *O2 Media Awards (Yorkshire and Humber) – Scoop of the Year 2013 Inside Out: Yorkshire and Lincolnshire – \\"The Battle of Orgreave\\"; Runner up, Best News Reporter 2013; Runner up, Best TV Journalist 2013.

They may treat both the itching caused by bites and may remove or kill the fleas themselves.  For humans  The itching associated with flea bites can be treated with anti-itch creams, usually antihistamines or hydrocortisone. Calamine lotion has been shown to be effective for itching.  For pets  Flea and tick repellant powder being applied to a dog. Modern flea control is approached using integrated pest management (IPM) protocols at the host (pet) level. IPM is achieved by targeting fleas during at least two separate life stages, with at least two separate molecules. This is typically achieved using an adulticide to kill adult fleas and an insect development inhibitor (IDI), such as lufenuron, or insect growth regulator (IGR), such as methoprene, to prevent development of immature stages. Flea adults, larvae, or eggs can be controlled with insecticides. Lufenuron is a veterinary preparation (known as Program) that attacks the larval flea's ability to produce chitin, necessary for the adult's hard exoskeleton, but it does not kill fleas. Flea medicines need to be used with care because many of them also affect mammals. Flea treatments meant for dogs can be hazardous to cats. Flea and tick ointment is also hazardous to humans. If the product comes into contact with human skin, it is recommended to wash thoroughly with soap and water.Label of Bio Spot spot on flea and tick control for dogs. 2007, 2010. Phoenix, AZ: Farnam Companies, Inc. Since more than three-quarters of a flea's life is spent somewhere other than on the host animal, it is not adequate to treat only the host; it is important also to treat the host's environment. Thorough vacuuming, washing linens in hot water, and treating all hosts in the immediate environment (the entire household, for example) is essential for successful eradication. These steps should be performed on a regular basis. Contemporary commercial products for the topical treatment of flea infestations on pets contain pesticides such as imidacloprid, permethrin, and (S)-methoprene. All flea-control products are recommended to be used at least half-yearly because the lifecycle of flea can last up to a year. Although these products are effective in fighting against flea and tick infestations, they have different active ingredients and, because cats cannot metabolize some of the compounds of the product, care must be taken in their use.  For the home  Flea infestation in the home is treated in various ways. Insecticides. A spot-on insecticide kills the fleas on the pet. A fogger or spray insecticide containing an insect growth regulator, such as pyriproxyfen or methoprene can kill eggs and pupae, which are quite resistant to insecticides. A comparison of 3 insecticides (selamectin, fipronil, imidacloprid) showed that selamectin reduced larval cat fleas ≥93.5% after 24 h at doses of ≥0.3 μg. In contrast, at 24 h neither fipronil nor imidacloprid reached 90% reduction, even at the highest doses tested (0.5 μg for fipronil and 5.0 μg for imidacloprid). A similar pattern of activity was observed at both 48 and 72 h, but higher percentages of larvae were killed for each of the compounds as the incubation time increased. Flea fecal material, coiled larva, and fleas in the pupal stage combed from a cat, are also called flea dirt. Vacuuming. Frequent and thorough vacuuming is also helpful. The vacuum must be used around everything the animal frequents in order to pick up all the larvae and eggs. Traditional advice recommends disposing of the bag after each vacuuming. One very limited experiment (only one vacuum sweeper used on a single type of carpeted surface) found that vacuuming killed 96% of adult fleas and 100% of younger fleas. This preliminary study's applicability to other circumstances is unclear. Diatomaceous earth can also be used as a home flea treatment in lieu of acetylcholinesterase inhibitory treatments or insecticides which carry with them a risk of poisoning for both humans and other animals. However, diatomaceous earth dust is harmful to pets and people when inhaled, requiring use of a dust mask to apply. Bathing dramatically reduces the flea population on a badly infested animal, especially when in combination with a mild detergent or shampoo and brushing or combing. Borax can be used to treat flea infestations. It kills fleas by dehydrating them, but its safety for pets is untested. Temperature. Fleas cannot withstand high temperatures, so a turn through the dryer on medium or high kills fleas on clothing. Water and detergent. Fleas can be drowned by immersion for about 24 hours; they may appear to be dead if immersed for shorter times, but can revive after some hours. Soaps and surfactants can facilitate the death of fleas in bathing. The process of washing the flea (and the pet) removes integumental waxes on the flea's body and it dies from dehydration.

The city center, focused on the confluence of the Winooski River with its North Branch, has been economically driven by state government since 1805, and had industry powered by the rivers. Its center reflects a diversity of 19th century architecture. In addition to the Vermont State House, the district includes The Pavilion, the commercial downtown area, and residential areas to the east and north. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and enlarged in 1989 and 2018. Description and history Montpelier was chartered in 1781, and was a sleepy rural community when it was named the state capital in 1805, primarily for its geographically central location and access to road and waterways. This inaugurated a development boom, with State Street forming an important axis between the state complex and the town center. The town was named the county seat of what is now Washington County in 1811. Industrial development was enhanced by the arrival of the railroad in 1849, and the town's economy boomed after the American Civil War. It was reincorporated as a city in 1895. Growth slowed after World War I, with the rise of the automobile and increasing suburbanization. with The historic district is defined in large part by its two principal waterways. The North Branch flows south into the west-flowing Winooski River, with the central business district mainly northeast of their confluence. Major roadways parallel these two rivers, with State Street running west to the state capitol, and Barre and Berlin Streets running east. Main Street runs north- south to a branching point with Elm Street, where it turns east, constrained by the steep contours of the surrounding hills. The central business district is largely characterized by brick buildings built after twof fires swept the area in 1875.

During her time on the New England blockade, \\"Rifleman had more punishments, with a higher number of lashes, than any other British ship in New England waters.\\" In June 1814 Rifleman was under the command of Commander Henry Edward Napier, who sailed her for North America and the West Indies. On 26 August 1814, a British squadron from Halifax moved to capture the Down East coastal town of Machias. The intention of the expedition was clearly to re-establish British title to Maine east of the Penobscot River, an area the British had renamed \\"New Ireland\\", and open the line of communications between Halifax and Quebec. The expedition was under the overall command of Sir John Sherbrooke and Rear Admiral Edward Griffith Colpoys controlled the naval elements. En route, the squadron fell in with Rifleman and learned that the , commanded by Captain Charles Morris, was undergoing repairs at Hampden, on the Penobscot River. The British commanders then decided to capture Adams. The first ships to go were , , , , , as well as some transports. , , Rifleman, and joined on the 31st.

Their objective was , of twenty-six 18-pounder guns, which had taken refuge some 27 miles up stream at Hampden, Maine. Here Adams had landed her guns and fortified a position on the bank with fifteen 18-pounders commanding the river. Moving up the river took two days, but eventually, after the Battle of Hampden, the British were able to capture the American defenders at Bangor, though not until after the Americans had burnt Adams. The British also captured 11 other ships and destroyed six. The British lost only one man killed, a sailor from Dragon, and had several soldiers wounded.The Anglo- American Magazine, (Toronto: Maclear), Vol. 5, pp.418-9. On 8 September, Bacchante, Rifleman, Tenedos, and Pictou captured the American schooner Fox at Machias, Maine. The British took the opportunity to confiscate a quantity of meat that they loaded on to Fox before they sent her to Saint John, New Brunswick. Commander George Bennet Allen replaced Napier on 22 August 1815. (Napier declined accepting a piece of plate with which Nova Scotian merchants had wished to acknowledge his care in the conduct of convoys between the port of Saint John, New Brunswick and Castine, Maine.) Commander Houston Stewart replaced Allen a year later, in August 1816, at Jamaica. On 11 May 1817, Rifleman captured a brigantine off Aux Cayes, whose crew reported that she had been the famous Charleston privateer schooner Saucy Jack. The brigantine was armed with one 12-pounder gun and one 12-pounder carronade. She had a crew of 18 men \\"of all colours and nations\\", and was loaded with plunder. She had been a prize to the Carthaginian privateer Creole, which had fitted her out to cruise. However, part of the crew had mutinied and been landed. Rifleman took the 18 prisoners on board, brought them to Kingston, Jamaica, and handed them over to the police as pirates. A British prize crew, under a lieutenant, sailed the brigantine for Port Royal.Lloyd's List, № 5196. In June Commander Robert Felix replaced Stewart. Three months later, in September, Commander Norwich Duff replaced Felix. He sailed Rifleman to Portsmouth where she was paid of on 11 August 1818. Between January and July 1820 she underwent repairs. She was not fitted for sea, however, until April to July 1823. In April, Commander James Montague recommissioned her for the Halifax station. Commander William Webb replaced him there in July 1824. In December 1826 Commander Frederick Thomas Michell was in command and sailed Rifleman to the Mediterranean. There he was attached to the commissariat of the French army in the Morea. Rifleman did not participate in the battle of Navarino, though Admiral Sir Edward Codrington had her surveil the port for a period prior to the battle.

The Durationator takes research done at the law school and transforms it into code using what is designed to be an accessible tool, to determine the copyright status of a work. The Durationator began as an idea in 2007, when Matt Miller, then a 2L law student with previous coding experience, applied to be a research assistant. Townsend Gard had been working on copyright, and in particular the copyright status of works. Legals terms can be complicated, and the idea was to blend the research and code. Initial estimates were for the project to be completed in the summer. Although both the initial \\"logic engine\\" for the Durationator code and a prototype of the legal framework were developed that summer, the process of researching worldwide laws and reducing those laws to a finite number of questions with discrete answers took ten years. The research has focused on all of the elements that need to go into making a decision about the status of the work in whatever country is being searched. These elements can vary greatly. The team has also attempted to gather every law regarding copyright, creating a searchable database. The tool uses Logicnets as its platform, a logic tree search engine.

He currently competes on the independent wrestling circuit in the Great Lakes region as Rob Clooney. Teet is best known for his accomplishments in beach wrestling, where he has earned All American honors four times, an alternate for the United States wrestling team twice, and earned All World honors as a member of the U.S. wrestling team at the 2011 World Beach Wrestling Championships. Teet is also an All American in belt wrestling. Early life Teet was a fan of professional wrestling in the late 1980s, and expressed interest in participating in amateur wrestling. Growing up in River Rouge, Michigan, there weren't amateur wrestling clubs available. He finally had the chance to compete after his family moved to Brown City, Michigan during his freshman year in high school. Teet won the team's \\"Rookie of the Year\\" award, was a part of the school's first team district championship during his sophomore season, and qualified for the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) individual state championships his junior year. By the end of his junior season, Teet became the first wrestler from Brown City to have more than thirty wins in a season and held the school record for pins in a season. Before the start of his senior year, Teet enrolled in Riverview Community High School. MHSAA rules prohibited Teet from competition during the first semester, which resulted in Teet not getting enough matches to qualify for the post-season. He did not wrestle in college. Professional Wrestling Teet began his pro wrestling training with the National Wrestling Alliance-Great Lakes in 2000, making his debut in 2001 as Rick Solid. He often teamed up with real-life best friend, Raymond Gold, as the team Solid Gold. The duo won a pair of tag-team championships before Teet embarked a singles career. During his tenure as Rick Solid, Teet won the Underground Wrestling Alliance's Heavyweight and I-C Championship, the Livonia Entertainment Wrestling Championship, the Xtreme Boarder Wrestling Championship, and the Blue Water Championship Wrestling Cruiserweight Championship. He won the BWCW Tag-Team Championship with Buddy Hanlon, and won the 2002 King of the North tournament. He also wrestled for Thunderzone Wrestling, Superior Wrestling Alliance, Independent Wrestling Revolution, Urban Wrestling Alliance, and Universal Wrestling Alliance. Other career highlights include a successful BWCW Cruiserweight title defense against Shark Boy and an unsuccessful attempt at winning the X Division Championship in a match featuring then-X Division Champion Chris Sabin, Truth Martini and Buddy Hanlon. Teet took time away from professional wrestling in late 2003, to mourn the death of Raymond Gold. He returned to the ring in the spring of 2005, eventually changing his name to Rob Clooney and teaming up with Deuce Diamond as the Motor City High Rollers. Return to Amateur Wrestling Anthony Gallton (left) vs Teet (right) at the 2010 USA World Team Trials Teet left professional wrestling early in 2007 to compete in amateur wrestling. He competed weekly in local Amateur Athletic Union tournaments, winning the AAU- Michigan State Championship in folkstyle wrestling. He competed at the 2007 USA Wrestling Beach Wrestling National Championships in Rochester, New York, where he became an All American after placing third in the 150 pound weight class. The top three finish qualified him for the World Team Trials in the Lightweight division (187 pounds and lower), where he placed fourth to become an alternate for the 2007 U.S. Wrestling Team. During the Trials, he pinned 187 pound National Champion, Neil Cook, to earn a spot in the bronze medal match. Teet again won the AAU-Michigan State Championship in folkstyle in 2008, along with the Florida Ironman Championships. He finished in second place at the Beach Wrestling National Championships, but failed to win a match during the World Team Trials. In 2009, Teet suffered an injury that kept him out for the year. He made a comeback in 2010 and placed second at the Beach Wrestling National Championships, and finished in 4th place at the World Team Trials to be named an alternate for the U.S. Team for the second time in his career. United World Wrestling (then known as FILA) expanded the number of weight classes for Men from two to four in 2011. The United States selected their members for the 2011 Beach Wrestling U.S. Team, in which Teet was selected to represent the 154 pound (70 kg) weight class. During the World Championships, held in Batumi, Georgia, Teet wrestled American teammate Donovan DePatto for the silver medal. Teet lost the match, finishing 4th place in the competition to earn All World honors. The match between Teet and DePatto marked them as the first two athletes from the western hemisphere to compete for a medal other than bronze at the Beach Wrestling World Championships. Teet has been involved in beach wrestling as an athlete, referee, coach, and tournament director. Teet retired from amateur wrestling in 2013, but has on occasion entered beach wrestling competitions. He won the Michigan USA Wrestling State Championship in 2015 and 2017, and earned All American honors in beach wrestling and belt wrestling in 2018. Return to Professional Wrestling Teet returned to the ring in 2013, and reformed the Motor City High Roller team with Deuce Diamond, until Deuce retired in early 2016. He has competed for Blue Water Championship Wrestling, Pro Wrestling All Stars, Pure Pro Wrestling, and Takedown Wrestling Alliance. He reached the finals of the Raymond Gold 10 Year Memorial Tournament, losing to Breyer Wellington. He has teamed up with \\"The Maize Rage\\" Rampage in 2016, and the team known as All American Aggression won the TWA Tag-Team Championship near the end of the year and held the titles for a 910-day reign.

Geography The Ishas are bounded to the north by the Northern Nago groups of the Bassila arrondissement, to the east by the Mahi- Gbe people, to the south and the west, by Ife-Ana people. The region is characterized by large concentrations villages. These villages have on average about three thousand individuals who usually, mostly belong to the lineage of the original founding groups. The terrain is about 70% plateau covered in rolling grassland savannah and 20% hills of varying elevations of between 200 and 400 meters, the highest among them being Koubete and Olaje hills, while the other 10% is lowland and water bodies. The Isha live in a zone of transition between the sub-equatorial climate of southern Benin and the Guinea-Sudan climate of northern Benin. The dry season generally lasts from December to March, while the rainy season from April to November. The average annual rainfall between the years 2005 and 2009 was 1093 mm.http://www.mairie- bante.com/description.pdf History The Isha have been at their present location for a very long time. Ethnographers are of the belief that the whole of middle /central Benin was historically covered by a large Yoruba group called the Isha. Upon subsequent periods of tumults and wars, other groups came to be found in the area as well, especially the Mahi, a Fon offshoot, whose settlement divided the previous local population into eastern and western groups. The eastern groups include the Shabe and Idaasha, whose territories are contiguous with the rest of Yorubaland, while the Ana-Ifes, Ishas and Northern Nago-Manigri groups form the left bank groups. This is evidenced in the remnant or articles of \\"Isha\\" which are replete in the names of settlements in the area, which include, but are not limited to: Idaasha, Shawuru, Isha, Ishabe, E.tc. The history and present social dynamic of the group who presently self identify as Isha is a result of long migratory movements accompanied by numerous wars and conquests. Indeed, the Ife people and Isha were formed by three successive waves of migration from further east in present-day Nigeria. The first and the oldest are said to have migrated from Ilesha. The two most recent, from Oyo and Ile- Ife.http://www.memoireonline.com/07/10/3708/Determinants-socio-culturels-de- la-persistence-de-lexcision--Pira-Benin.html The first Isha villages founded are: Banon, Bobe, Adjantè, Djédia, Kubètè, Koko, Lougba, Akpassi and Djagballo. This is the first nucleus that gave birth to the current Isha people in central Benin. This original Isha group from Ilesha were the largest group and the first to settle at the present site. After passing through the towns of Tchaourou and later Bassila, they first settled in Eastern Togo, in the regions of Popo and Kpessi, but they had to later retreat into the collines of Benin due to pressure from marauding soldiers of Opoku ware, king of the Ashanti. The most recent of the migration waves, that of Oyo were led by a hunter named Obinti who had a long stay in the hills of Igbo Idaasha then Igbo Ogou forest, before settling in the current Ile lakun quarter of Bante. Then came the Ife group led by a warrior called Oji. They crossed Agbassa, Igbo-Ilu-odji (now Igbo-Nan-odji) to occupy today Ilé-Ilu-odji (Lozin). Ultimately, the current Ife and Isha country was gradually established through the original migratory waves of Ijesha, Oyo and Ife Yoruba groups from Nigeria. Community The Isha society is patrilineal in nature, and married women move off to live with their husbands and his family. Villages generally comprise multiple homes, each home containing one or more extended families and others living under the authority of the court Head, (Baba Ile). Inside the courtyard (Agbo-Ile), there are a number of homes clustered around small courtyards (Ojulé) to the end of which is a small court (Ba-Ile). Organization is in a maze in which stratification match the different kinship groups. The human ideal pursued by the Isha sociocultural group is the Omo-Oluwabi (Omo = child, Oluwa = lord/god & Bi = born/result) .Omoluabi is the child that the Lord has created, the perfect model human in deeds and in character. Agriculture remains the main economic activity of Isha land with an involvement rate of around 63.57%. Corn, peanuts, Yams, Cassava, Cotton, Cowpea, Cashew, Pepper, Sesame, Beans, Soybeans, Pigeon peas and Fruits are the products that provide money to residents. The importance of land used for each plant varies from one locality to another. Settlements Isha townsvillages include Bantè, Agoua, Akpassi, Atokoligbé , Bobè, Koko, Gouka, Lougba and Pira, which are also all arrondissements or local divisions under the Commune of Bante. Dialect The Isha people refer to their dialect as Ede Isha, or simply Isha. According to Ethnologue, the dialect exhibits a Lexical similarity of 83% with spoken Yoruba of Porto- Novo.https://www.ethnologue.com/country/bj/languages References Category:Yoruba subgroups ","title":"Isha people"},{"id":"52159171","text":"Don't Smoke Rock is the first collaborative studio album by rapper Smoke DZA and producer Pete Rock. It was released on December 2, 2016, by Babygrande Records, Sony Music and The Orchard. The album features guest appearances from Dave East, Rick Ross, Royce da 5'9\\", Cam'ron, NymLo, BJ the Chicago Kid, Jadakiss, Styles P, Wale, Big K.R.I.T., Dom Kennedy, theMIND and Mac Miller.  Critical reception  Bringing a taste of the Golden Age into 2016, Pete Rock and Smoke DZA remind listeners that solid production and thoughtful, socially relevant rhymes are timeless on their collaborative effort, Don't Smoke Rock. Employing his trademark sample style, the legendary Rock weaves jazz and soul snippets throughout each track, as DZA and a stacked roster of guests take turns with bars reminiscent of the '90s, a time when there was more to mainstream hip-hop than mumbling. The results are refreshing, nostalgic, and extremely satisfying for fans of that period. Released in the same year that saw the return of De La Soul, The LOX and A Tribe Called Quest, Don't Smoke Rock serves as another link between eras: paying respects to old- school hip-hop legacy with updated perspectives and production quality. In case their intent was unclear, DZA even introduces the LP reminiscing about a pre-gentrification \\"old Harlem\\" on \\"Intro\\" and later pining for the good old days on the creeping Cam'Ron & Nymlo track \\"Moving Weight, Pt. 1.\\" Rock's samples range from dramatic strings (\\"Wild 100s\\"), haunting hypnotic loops (the monstrous Wale track \\"Show Off\\"), and booming horns (the Dave East joint \\"Limitless\\") to inspired comedic bits from Bernie Mac (\\"I Ain't Scared\\") and Chris Tucker (\\"Until Then\\"). Highlights are numerous. On \\"Black Superhero Car\\", DZA and Rick Ross trade verses over a throwback sample that sounds like early-era Pete Rock-disciple Kanye West. Royce Da 5'9\\" contributes to the plaintive, aptly titled piano-looper \\"Hold The Drums\\", and an all-star cast of BJ The Chicago Kid, Jadakiss, and Styles P descend upon \\"Milestone\\". The 13-track time machine does not relent or disappoint, making Don't Smoke Rock a standout for hip-hop fans in need of quality nourishment.

It yields a Pareto-efficient division that maximizes the rank of the agent with the lowest rank. This corresponds to the Rawlsian justice criterion of taking care of the worst-off agent. The procedure was developed by Dorothea Herreiner and Clemens Puppe.  Description  Each agent is supposed to have a linear ranking on all bundles of items. The agents are queried in a round-robin fashion: each agent, in turn, reports his next bundle in the ranking, going from the best to the worst. After each report, the procedure checks whether it is possible to construct a complete partition of the items based on the reports made so far. If it is possible, then the procedure stops and returns one such partition. If there is more than one partition, then a Pareto- efficient one is returned. The procedure produces \\"balanced\\" allocations, that is, allocations which maximize the rank in the preference ordering of the bundle obtained by the worst-off agent.  Limitations  The procedure requires the agents to rank bundles of items. This is feasible when the number of items is small, but may be difficult when the number of items is large, since the number of bundles grows exponentially with the number of items. The procedure does not guarantee envy-freeness; see envy-free item assignment for procedures that do guarantee it.

His subordinate units, establishments, and staff were sometimes informally known as the Dover Command. History In late July 1914, with war looming, 12 Tribal-class destroyers arrived at Dover to join the near obsolete destroyers already at anchor in the harbour, most of them built in the late 19th century. These destroyers formed the nucleus of the fledgling Dover Patrol, which, from its early beginnings as a modest and poorly equipped command, became one of the most important Royal Navy commands of the First World War. The command was instituted on 12 October 1914 under the command of Rear Admiral Rear Admiral Sir Horace Lambert Alexander Hood. Following the extra strain thrown on the Admiral of Patrols Rear Admiral George Alexander Ballard and his staff caused by the beginning of mine laying and the evacuation of Antwerp, the Admiralty decided to create a separate command encompassing the patrols from the naval base at Dover, the naval base itself, and the Downs Boarding Flotilla. Command was transferred to Rear-Admiral The Honorable Horace L. A. Hood on 11 October, and he hoisted his flag on 13 October. He was given the title of Rear-Admiral Commanding the Dover Patrol and Senior Naval Officer Commanding, Dover, with the short title \\"Rear- Admiral, Dover Patrol\\". The Dover Patrol operated continuously through the end of the war, with its strength consisting primarily of the Sixth Destroyer Flotilla, the Fifth Submarine Flotilla, the Downs Boarding Flotilla, and at times a collection of monitors. Its primary mission was to monitor barriers and defences at the eastern end of the English Channel to prevent U-boats from gaining access to western areas. It also harassed German fortifications on the coast of occupied Belgium. During the Second World War, like Rosyth, and Orkneys and Shetlands, this former Great War command was re-established in 1939 to control and protect sea traffic in the Straits of Dover. It was formed by removing the Straits from Nore Command. Its function was to protect the supply lines to France. Its primary role failed disastrously during its supervision of the evacuation from Dunkirk code-named Operation Dynamo. Once the threat of a German invasion subsided in 1941, its continued existence as a separate command from Nore Command was perceived by some quarters as more to do with prestige. The command played a prominent part in the Normandy landings. Administration of Dover command=World War OneCommander-in-Chief, Dover= Post holders include: * Rear-Admiral The Hon. Horace L. A.

Early life  Dessa was born into a Jewish family in Southern Rhodesia, the daughter of a Polish mother and a Hungarian father, who completed his medical training in Italy. Her father established the first private medical practice in Bulawayo for Black Africans. As a young child, Dessa had instruction in ballet and piano, the latter playing a central role in her art. After matriculating she lived in Israel from 1965 to 1976, where she studied occupational therapy. In 1977 she moved to Paris and then to Switzerland in 1981, becoming a Swiss citizen in 1983.  Career  Dessa grew up in a society determined by racial divisions. This experience is reflected in her art, which synthesizes associations and transcend borders. Her creative output reflects her cultural diversity, both in the choice of her subjects (through which she explores her identity), and the mediums and means of expression she utilizes. In her early period she explores the relationship between visual art and music. Many works from this period arose from meditations on specific works, complemented by musicological research, resulting in paintings in which the music guides her artistic expression. Composers whose music has inspired visual responses include Béla Bartók, Leonard Bernstein, Ernst Bloch, Benjamin Britten, Unsuk Chin, Detlev Glanert, Dominique Gesseney-Rappo, Erich Korngold, Gustav Mahler, Olivier Messiaen, René Oberson, and Nino Rota. The scope of her work has expanded since 2000, as her works take on a profound historical dimension, integrating copious research as well as rare archival materials.  Visual works in dialogue with music  > Dessa's art works are, in fact, dialogues expressed as paintings. They are > dialogues that often resemble spiritual exercises. Because – if they are not > in direct communication with a musician like today's improvisation – they > require a lot of solitude, concentration and sacfrifice. With interlocutors > such as Mahler, Schreker, Ullmann or Britten one simply cannot discuss. One > has to love them, know them well, their ideas, their destiny, their tragedy. > Without this, they do not open up to us.Frank Harders-Wuthenow. Do we smile > or do we weep? Paintings based on Benjamin Britten's Four Sea Interludes and > Passacaglia from Peter Grimes, Assens, May 31, 2015. The scope of her musical collaborators has enlarged to include living composers (Unsuk Chin und Detlev Glanert). Additionally she has collaborated on several \\"live-painting\\" concerts, e.g. Flying Colours and Musiques et Pinceaux, 2008. The music of Viktor Ullmann, specifically the last Piano Sonata No 7, brought to life the loss of her grandparents in Auschwitz concentration camp. Ullmann, who had been deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp, composed his final works there, before he was deported to the camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where he was murdered on 18 October 1944. Her 1997 project \\"Ein Vermächtnis aus Theresienstadt\\" (A Legacy from Theresienstadt) was exhibited both in the Berliner Dom in 2000 as well as in Theresienstadt in 2002. > The music gives rhythm to the gesture and allows the color to unfold... > Dessa seizes the canvas, sets in motion powerful waves that burst into foam > with their disheveled splatters, ground-swells that tear the surface of > their irresistible force...

The Kaufhaus N. Israel was not only for a time the largest department store in Berlin but also one of the largest retail establishments in Europe, employing over 2,000 people. The album that Dessa found was one in a series of fifteen annual publications that the Kaufhaus N. Israel published between 1900 and 1914.Alice Lanzke. \\"Ich folge meinem Weg – Deborah Petroz-Abeles ist stolz auf ihr Judentum und ihre afrikanische Herkunft\\", Jüdische Allgemeine, Berlin , 12 November 2015. Dessa created a series of paintings entitled \\"Stolzesteine\\", both as a tribute to N. Israel and as a reaction to the Stolperstein which she encountered in Berlin. In her view, the Stolperstein are a particularly problematical method of commemorating murdered Jews, nonetheleast because they are trampled on and dirtied. The artist is extremely critical of any \\"mass\\" project which collectively represents Holocaust victims by reducing their existence to a single symbol, as this method of portrayal invariably calls to mind the marking of Jews with the yellow star by the Nazis.Alice Lanzke.

In 2015, Dessa embarked on an ambitious project engaging with the legacy of Dr Alice Salomon, social reformer, educator, economist, feminist and peace activist, though her project titled « The Art of Remembrance: Alice Salomon\\". Salomon’s doctoral thesis expounded the inequality of wages between men and women, and she founded the Social School for Women in Berlin in 1908. Salomon was exiled from Germany in 1937 on account of her Jewish origins and international peace activities. In addition to her own research and writings, Dessa used various techniques to engage the viewer with Alice Salomon’s intensive and extensive life: paintings, collages, objects, installations and an imaginary conversation form a thorough narrative. As in many of Dessa’s other works, several paintings (here four separate portraits) feature a commemorative stone which has been inserted into the painting.Ariadne Forum für Frauen- und Geschlechtergeschichte 75. \\"Gleichberechtigung als Prozess\\", Ariadne 75: Gleichberechtigung als Prozess, Kassel 2019.

He was detained in 2016 in compromising circumstances, while allegedly trying to hide bags containing millions of dollars in a convent. The event In the early morning hours of June 14, 2016, López allegedly drove to the convent of Our Lady of Fátima on the General Rodríguez Partido and started to throw bags over the fence. Afterward, he climbed over the fence himself. A neighbor noticed and called the police, fearing for the safety of the three elderly nuns who lived there. According to security tapes retrieved afterwards, López took his rifle and the bags to the door of the convent, left them there, and returned to the fence to retrieve more bags, while the nuns took the bags inside. The police arrived at 4:00 AM and initially detained López for illegal possession of a .22 caliber rifle. The police then found the bags containing approximately $7 million in plastic-wrapped dollars, euros, yens, and other currencies, as well as some luxury watches. The police found more money in the trunk of López's car, and in the convent kitchen. According to Security Minister Cristian Ritondo, López may have tried to bribe the police, to no avail. He was then charged for money laundering. Police investigators suggest that López's plan, in case he could successfully leave the money at the convent, would be to go to the San Fernando Airport and escape in a private plane, which was ready to depart. This plane was usually used by the sons of Lázaro Báez, who are also detained on corruption charges. A detailed investigation of the convent revealed three hidden vaults, discovered by police dogs. The main one measured , and may have contained $480 million. The nuns said the vault had been set aside to house the remains of the elder Mother Alba. Judicial case The López case is headed by judge Daniel Rafecas. Although court psychologists declared López fit to testify, he wanted to be declared incompetent. His lawyer Fernanda Herrera, who is also a cumbia singer, claimed that López was delirious and suffered hallucinations. López was also indicted in a case involving the former governor Eduardo Fellner and the social activist Milagro Sala, who are suspected of stealing money earmarked for public works. López was taken to Jujuy to be formally notified of the charge and his right to a defense, but he refused to make any comments. Although the dollars were plastic-wrapped in a way that only the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) is authorized to use, the BCRA was unable to identify the money and locate its source. It was pointed out that the BCRA only keeps track of official money movement. The confiscated money is being kept in a vault at the BCRA, for the duration of the case. If López is found guilty, the money would return to the state; otherwise, it would be returned to López. The nun Alba Martínez, who led the convent, was declared incompetent to testify at trial by the judge. Aged 95, she suffers cognitive impairment and moderate dementia, and may not be able to answer questions with veracity. The prosecutor Federico Delgado will not appeal the ruling. Rafecas also declared the nun Inés Aparicio (who appears in the security tapes carrying bags into the convent) to be innocent, as she claimed that she thought that the bags contained food for welfare purposes. Prosecutors Delgado and Moldes do not trust her, and asked for her indictment. Notebook scandal Since his detention, José López had only given vague and scant answers about the source of the money. When the Notebook scandal started, he agreed to give a full testimony and turn state's evidence. The judge accepted it, and he was removed from the prison in Ezeiza (shared with other convicted officials of the Kirchner government) to an undisclosed location. López pointed to Néstor and Cristina Kirchner as the masterminds of the operation. His lawyer, Pamela Bisserier, asked for his release from prison. She argued that he had given testimony and helped the investigation, and that there was no risk of escape or interference. The prosecutor did no agree, and the judges Ricardo Basílico, Adrián Grunberg and Juan Michilini voted against the release. They considered that there was still a risk of escape, despite the collaboration, and that both cases are treated independently. They pointed that the deal between López and Claudio Bonadio, judge of the Notebook scandal case, is protected under seal, and considered that they do not know enough about it to justify a release.

It is located in the historical Castello district. The building had been originally built in the 14th century and became the seat of the viceroy since 1337, at the behest of Peter IV of Aragon.Cagliari, Palazzo Regio URL consultato il 30 dicembre 2007 Over the centuries the building underwent several modifications and extensions. Particularly significant were the 18th century restorations; in 1730, at the hands of the Piedmontese engineers de Guibert and de Vincenti it was built the grand staircase leading to the main floor, the rooms of which were restored in 1735 by della Vallea. The west facade, with the main portal in line with the staircase, was arranged by 1769, as evidenced by the inscription on the window bezel door that opens onto the central balcony. Between 1799 and 1815 the palace was the official residence of the royal family and the court, in exile from Turin occupied by Napoleon. In 1885 the palace became property of the Province, who established its representative office and oversaw the restoration of the interior, in order to adapt to the new function. In 1893 began the work of decoration on the Council room, by the perugian Domenico Bruschi for the frescoes and dell'Angeletti for the stuccos. The work was completed in 1896.

He is an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy and the Indian Academy of Sciences and a recipient of the National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2010, for his contributions to biological sciences.  Biography  Sanjeev Galande, born on 20 September 1967 in Pune, in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, did his master's degree in biochemistry (MSc) at Savitribai Phule Pune University before obtaining his doctoral studies from the Indian Institute of Science in 1996. He moved to the US the same year to join the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to complete his post-doctoral studies on the role of MAR-binding proteins in tumorigenesis in 2001 and on his return to India, he joined National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) as a senior scientist. He headed the Sanjeev Galande Laboratory at NCCS till 2010 when he shifted to the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune as a professor and established the Centre of Excellence in Epigenetics (CoEE) there. He heads the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics where he hosts a number of researchers who focus their studies on evolution of epigenetic mechanisms using multiple model systems. He also serves as an adjunct faculty at Savitribai Phule Pune University.  Legacy  Galande's early researches during his doctoral studies were on MAR-binding proteins and carcinogenesis but later he shifted his focus to cell-type specific patterns of gene expression and how chromatin levels influence them which was the theme of his researches at NCCS. His team demonstrated the effect of cellular signaling pathways impact the chromatin levels. After his move to IISER, Pune, he started working on epigenetic regulation on various substrata viz. yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans (round worm), Drosophila (fruit flies), Zebrafish and humans, using them as biological model systems. His team investigate biological processes such as transcription, gene regulation, cell proliferation, self-renewal and regeneration and their interrelations for which they employ genetic, biochemical, molecular and computational approaches. His studies are reported to have assisted in widening our understanding of the development and differentiation of T cells and the impact of Wnt signaling pathways in the process. He is involved in three running projects; Intergenerational programming of diabesity in offspring of women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (InDiaGDM), Role of chromatin organizer SATB1 in T cell development and differentiation and The role of Chromatin reorganisers in X inactivation. Galande has detailed his researches by way of a number articles and ResearchGate, an online article repository has listed 87 of them. He has mentored several scholars at his laboratories in NCCS and IISER and coordinated the National Research Scholars Meet in Life Sciences in 2005. He has also established a number of multidisciplinary academic programs at IISER which covers such topics as biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, cell biology, proteomics, and genomics and has participated in several seminars on these topics.

It is a residential subdivision, formed into small grid by Lakeside, Wright, Conger, Central, and Harrison Avenues. Most of the residences in the area are multiunit buildings housing anywhere from two to twelve units. The buildings are all of wood frame construction, with some finished in a brick veneer. There are five designs that are widely used, with a duplex configuration the single most numerous building type. Most of the block bounded by Central, Wright, Conger, and Harrison is an open field for public passive recreational use. with This residential area was laid out, built, and managed by the Queen City Cotton Company, and is the only company- built residential area of its type in the city.

The majority of the building recognizable today was constructed in 1901 over a previous building built in 1892-3 that was never completed to its full plans. Built as a response to the boom created by the Yukon Gold Rush, the Colonial Hotel operated as a hotel into the 1970s and in the 1980s it was restored into apartments and connected to its southern neighbor, the Grand Pacific Hotel. Both were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Today they are known collectively as the Colonial Grand Pacific. History Following the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, the northward expansion of Seattle's business district from Pioneer Square, already in the planning stages prior to the fire, took on a rapid pace. A quick glut of new office space created by the boom however left many buildings incomplete and many more lots undeveloped as the economy began to cool in 1891. The 4-story Starr Building, built in 1890 on the west side of 1st Avenue between Spring and Seneca Streets, stood alone on the block until a second wave of construction began in 1892. The Kenyons Jacob Gardner Kenyon, a traveling ventriloquist and magician, first passed through Seattle in the early 1880s and with the ticket sales from his first show at Yesler Hall, purchased several lots on 1st Avenue before leaving town, purchasing even more on his second tour. The value of his property skyrocketed following the great fire but he refused all offers to lease it. In mid-1892, Kenyon commissioned prominent architect John Parkinson to design a six-story building of granite and white pressed brick to be built on his corner lot adjoining the Starr Building. Construction began in October 1892, and was only completed to the first floor on 1st Avenue, with the top 3 floors to be completed later. Kenyon died on December 22, 1892 and the property, along with all of Kenyon's Seattle holdings was willed to his son, Benjamin Kenyon. Litigation involving unpaid loans and under-compensated heirs soon followed along with the Panic of 1893, preventing the completion of the building for the rest of the decade. James Clise In December 1900, Prominent Seattle businessman and investor James Clise purchased the incomplete Kenyon Building and one other nearby lot from the Kenyon Estate for $430,000 and immediately made plans to complete the building to house a hotel to meet the demands of a city once again booming as a result of the Yukon Gold Rush. He commissioned architect Max Umbrecht, who had come to Seattle from Syracuse, New York earlier in the year under the employ of L.C. Smith. He designed several buildings for Smith's Pioneer Square properties and would go on to design several more for Clise and many more buildings in Seattle. Umbrecht chose an eclectic Federal motif for the top 3 floors of the building that would be built on top of the existing Kenyon building and likely inspire the hotel to be called the Colonial. In 1906 Clise sold the hotel to Sigmund Aronson and Harold Preston for $180,000. Weyerhaeuser In the mid 1960s, while many small downtown hotels in Seattle were being closed by the city's Nuisance abatement board, The Colonial Hotel was deemed to still be in fine condition and was allowed to stay open. Beginning in the late 70s, The Colonial and other historic buildings in the area were restored and redeveloped by Cornerstone Development Co, a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser as part of the Waterfront Center project, which combined new construction with older buildings restored for housing. During restoration, The Colonial Hotel was interconnected with the Grand Pacific Hotel to the south and the complex became known as the Colonial Grand Pacific Apartments. The Colonial Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 13, 1982.

Early life and education Tsai was born in 1960 to a family of farmers in Puli, Nantou. He graduated from a two-year college then associated with National Chengchi University. Political career The Kaohsiung Incident occurred while Tsai served in the Republic of China Armed Forces. After his discharge from the military, Tsai advocated for the further democratization of Taiwan. He was elected to the Puli township council in 1984, and joined the Democratic Progressive Party in 1987 upon the lifting of martial law and assorted restrictions on opposition parties. Tsai was later elected to the Nantou County Council and worked for legislator Hsu Jung-shu before his 1995 election to the Legislative Yuan. Tsai had become the chief executive of the DPP caucus by 2001, rising to caucus whip by 2004. In 2005, Tsai briefly resigned from the legislature to run for Nantou County Magistrate. Starting in 2006, Tsai was the party's spokesman and deputy secretary general. As a legislator, Tsai participated in many discussions pertaining to national defense and has served on the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee. In 2010, Tsai aided a Taiwanese man in processing a relinquishment of Bolivian nationality, so he could pursue a military career. The next year, Tsai was one of many DPP politicians to openly accuse China of interfering in Taiwan's elections. After an influx of cheap hairy crabs to the Taiwanese market in 2012, Tsai led calls to investigate the quality of all imported hairy crabs. Later that year, Tsai criticized the United States for linking its beef imports to the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement discussions. In 2013, Tsai planned to contest the Nantou County magistracy for the second time, but later ended his campaign. As the 2014 Taiwan food scandal unfolded, Tsai berated the Ministry of Justice for ineffectiveness in handling related cases. In 2016, he was invited to serve on the New Southbound Policy committee. Political stances Throughout his legislative tenure, Tsai has been concerned with the state of Cross-Strait relations, specifically the military threat of China, as well as the PRC's economic and diplomatic influence. Ma Ying-jeou and the China- friendly Kuomintang have been a frequent target of Tsai's criticism. Tsai has repeatedly asked the Ma Ying-jeou administration to protest China's military actions in the Taiwan Strait. After Su Tseng-chang became DPP chairman in 2012 and announced a softening of party policy toward China, Tsai chose to support the new stance. He backs closer Japan–Taiwan relations. Controversy The Taiwan High Court found Tsai guilty of bribery in 2011, after eight years of legal action. Upon retrial, Tsai was determined to be innocent of the charges. After further appeals, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's not guilty ruling in 2016.

Built in 1996, ERDF collects low-level waste, mixed waste, and other hazardous materials that are generated at Hanford. It does not collect any radioactive waste or other hazardous materials from other sites or the public. The hazardous waste dump was designed to be expanded as needed. The main storage facilities consist of single layer tanks that hold in all more than 17 million tons of nuclear waste. As of 2011, two new super tanks which hold double the amount of the single layer tanks were installed, providing safer levels of radioactivity in the surrounding ground areas and water sheds. Liners were previously installed to collect liquid released by the tanks or rain water that may seep in. The ERDF does not accept liquid waste, but water that seeps into the landfill is treated to keep the surrounding environment safe. Clean-up of waste is done by clean-up crews around the property. It is trucked to the main facilities to be processed and packaged. At its height there were more than 600 truckloads a day. Since clean-up began, more than 12,000,000 miles have been logged by truck drivers transporting waste containers to the facility. Processing is done by compacting waste and hazardous materials to make sure no air pockets remain. After adding support to the waste by adding cement blocks so the area will not sag, a temporary cap is placed over the waste until a permanent cap seals all the waste off from the site.

Example  Suppose there are four items: w,x,y,z. A person states that he ranks the items according to the following total order: :w \\\\prec x \\\\prec y \\\\prec z (i.e., z is his best item, then y, then x, then w). Assuming the items are independent goods, one can deduce that: :{w,x} \\\\prec {y,z} – the person prefers his two best items to his two worst items; :{w,y} \\\\prec {x,z} – the person prefers his best and third-best items to his second-best and fourth-best items. But, one cannot deduce anything about the bundles {w,z}, {x,y}; we do not know which of them the person prefers. The RS extension of the ranking w \\\\prec x \\\\prec y \\\\prec z is a partial order on the bundles of items, that includes all relations that can be deduced from the item-ranking and the independence assumption.  Definitions  Let O be a set of objects and \\\\preceq a total order on O. The RS extension of \\\\preceq is a partial order on 2^O. It can be defined in several equivalent ways.  Responsive set (RS)  The original RS extension is constructed as follows. For every bundle X\\\\subseteq O, every item x\\\\in X and every item y otin X, take the following relations: *X\\\\setminus{x} \\\\prec^{RS} X (- adding an item improves the bundle) *If x\\\\preceq y then X \\\\preceq^{RS} (X\\\\setminus{x})\\\\cup {y} (- replacing an item with a better item improves the bundle). The RS extension is the transitive closure of these relations.  Pairwise dominance (PD)  The PD extension is based on a pairing of the items in one bundle with the items in the other bundle. Formally, X \\\\preceq^{PD} Y if-and-only-if there exists an Injective function f from X to Y such that, for each x\\\\in X, x\\\\preceq f(x).  Stochastic dominance (SD)  The SD extension (named after stochastic dominance) is defined not only on discrete bundles but also on fractional bundles (bundles that contains fractions of items). Informally, a bundle Y is SD-preferred to a bundle X if, for each item z, the bundle Y contains at least as many objects, that are at least as good as z, as the bundle X. Formally, X\\\\preceq^{SD} Y iff, for every item z: :\\\\sum_{x \\\\succeq z} X[x] \\\\leq \\\\sum_{y\\\\succeq z}Y[y] where X[x] is the fraction of item x in the bundle X. If the bundles are discrete, the definition has a simpler form. X\\\\preceq^{SD} Y iff, for every item z: :{x\\\\in X x \\\\succeq z} \\\\leq {y\\\\in Y y\\\\succeq z}  Additive utility (AU)  The AU extension is based on the notion of an additive utility function. Many different utility functions are compatible with a given ordering. For example, the order w\\\\prec x\\\\prec y\\\\prec z is compatible with the following utility functions: :u_1(w)=0, u_1(x)=2, u_1(y)=4, u_1(z)=7 :u_2(w)=0, u_2(x)=2, u_2(y)=4, u_2(z)=5 Assuming the items are independent, the utility function on bundles is additive, so the utility of a bundle is the sum of the utilities of its items, for example: :u_1({w,x})=2, u_1({w,z})=7, u_1({x,y})=6 :u_2({w,x})=2, u_2({w,z})=5, u_2({x,y})=6 The bundle {w,x} has less utility than {w.z} according to both utility functions. Moreover, for every utility function u compatible with the above ranking: :u({w,x}). In contrast, the utility of the bundle {w,z} can be either less or more than the utility of {x,y}. This motivates the following definition: X\\\\preceq^{AU} Y iff, for every additive utility function u compatible with \\\\preceq: :u(X) \\\\leq u(Y)  Equivalence  * X\\\\preceq^{SD} Y implies X\\\\preceq^{RS} Y. * X\\\\preceq^{RS} Y and X\\\\preceq^{PD} Y are equivalent. * X\\\\preceq^{PD} Y implies X\\\\preceq^{AU} Y. Proof: If X\\\\preceq^{PD} Y, then there is an injection f: X\\\\to Y such that, for all x\\\\in X, x\\\\preceq f(x). Therefore, for every utility function u compatible with \\\\preceq, u(x) \\\\leq u(f(x)). Therefore, if u is additive, then u(X) \\\\leq u(Y). * It is known that \\\\preceq^{AU} and \\\\preceq^{SD} are equivalent, see e.g. Therefore, the four extensions \\\\preceq^{RS} and \\\\preceq^{PD} and \\\\preceq^{SD} and \\\\preceq^{AU} are all equivalent.  Responsiveness  A total order on bundles is called responsive if it is contains the responsive-set- extension of some total order on items. I.e., it contains all the relations that are implied by the underlying ordering of the items, and adds some more relations that are not implied nor contradicted. Responsiveness is implied by additivity, but not vice versa: * If a total order is additive (represented by an additive function) then by definition it contains the AU extension \\\\preceq^{AU}, which is equivalent to \\\\preceq^{RS}, so it is responsive. * On the other hand, a total order may responsive but not additive: it may contain the AU extension which is consistent with all additive functions, but may also contain other relations that are inconsistent with a single additive function. For example, suppose there are four items with w \\\\prec x \\\\prec y \\\\prec z. Responsiveness constrains only the relation between bundles of the same size with one item replaced, or bundles of different sizes where the small is contained in the large. It nothing about bundles of different sizes that are not subsets of each other. So, for example, a responsive order can have both {x} \\\\prec {y, z}and {w, x} \\\\succ {w, y, z}. But this is incompatible with additivity: there is no additive function for which u({x}) < u({y,z}) while u({w,x}) > u({w,y,z}).

Early life Sylvia Hope Ruxton was born in London, the daughter of William Fitzherbert Ruxton and Sylvia Howland Grinnell Ruxton. Her father was an admiral in the Royal Navy; her mother was American-born, the daughter of Henry Grinnell and the sister of Henry Walton Grinnell. Sylvia and her mother moved to Paris in 1896, where she attended school. Sylvia's memoir, Cocks in the Dawn (1944), recalls this time as the beginning of her lifelong attachment to France.Helen Callaway, \\"Sylvia Hope Leith-Ross\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press 2004). Career In 1907, as a new bride, she moved to Zungeru in Nigeria, where her husband was the chief transport officer for the British protectorate. She returned to Nigeria in 1910 as a widow, to stay with her brother and his wife Geneviève. The two women published a cookbook, West African Cookery (1908),Sylvia Leith-Ross and Geneviève Buxton, West African Cookery (informally published at Zunguru, 1908). which was popular with young European men new to Nigeria and unfamiliar with either cookery or West African produce. In 1921, she published Fulani Grammar, a basic guide to the Fulani language with some translated folktales.Sylvia Leith-Ross, Fulani Grammar (Secretariat Stationary Store 1921).W. A. C., review of Fulani Grammar, in Journal of the African Society 21(1922): 249–252.

In 1931 she was sent back to England to recover her health. When she returned again, she used a Leverhulme Research Fellowship to conduct anthropological studies among the women of eastern Nigeria, following the Women's War; this work resulted in the book African Women: A Study of the Ibo of Nigeria (1939).W.

During World War I, Sylvia Leith-Ross, using her fluency in French, volunteered in military hospitals under the supervision of the French Red Cross. That work led to a job at a clinic in London from 1920 to 1925. She also worked at military hospitals during the Spanish Civil War and early in World War II. She was in Nigeria for the rest of the second World War, in part to provide intelligence on the French colonies to the Political and Economic Research Organization.

Early life  Ernest Bashford was born in Bowdon, Cheshire, as the eldest son of William and Elizabeth Bashford. He attended George Heriot's School before studying at the University of Edinburgh. At Edinburgh he was Vans Dunlop Scholar in anatomy, chemistry, zoology and botany, Mackenzie Bursar in practical anatomy, and won the Wightman Prize in Clinical Medicine for his essay, “Some notes on cases treated in Ward XXVI of the Royal Infirmary during winter session 1896-97”, the Patterson Prize in Clinical Surgery, was appointed to the Houldsworth research scholarship in experimental pharmacology and won the Stark scholarship in clinical medicine and pathology. He graduated with an MB ChB in 1899, followed by an MD in 1900.  Career  Following graduation, he was awarded the McCosh graduate scholarship for study and research in Europe, an award which enabled him to travel to Germany, where he worked with Paul Ehrlich at the Royal Prussian Institute for Experimental Therapeutics, Frankfurt am Main, and then with Oscar Liebreich in the Pharmalogical Institute in Berlin. In 1901 he won the Milner Fothergill Gold Medal in Therapeutics at the University of Edinburgh and returned there to work as an assistant to Thomas Richard Fraser, professor of clinical medicine. In 1902 he married Elisabeth Alfermann, with whom he had a daughter, and also obtained his MD. That year he was appointed general superintendent of research at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and in 1903 he became director of the Fund's laboratories in London. During this time, he established the modern practice of experimental investigation of cancer in Britain, asserting that it was a biological problem and not confined to human pathology. From articles in the British Medical Journal and other publications, he prepared a volume of reprints concerning the problems, growth and heredity of cancer, and experiments with breast cancer in mice. In this period he oversaw more than 200,000 experiments on animals to study their resistance to transplanted tumours. His criticism of the work of Dr Robert Bell, who believed that all cancers were caused by disorder of the blood and that surgery could not be an effective cure, resulted in a libel trial from which Bell was awarded damages of £2,000. During the twelve years that he directed the laboratory, he established the Imperial Cancer Research Fund as an experimental research institution of international status. He was also president of the first International Cancer Congress in Heidelberg in 1906 and a delegate of the British government to the International Conference on Cancer Research in Paris in 1910.  Later life  In 1914 he resigned from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund on the grounds of ill health, and was succeeded as director by J.A. Murray. From 1915 he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, initially with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and then in France, where he held the post of adviser in pathology in the Army of Occupation. He was appointed OBE in 1919 and died from heart failure in Germany on 23 August 1923.

She was an editor, with her mentor Michael Samuels, of the world's largest and first historical thesaurus, the Historical Thesaurus of English, first published in 2009 as the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary (HTOED), a project to which she dedicated 40 years (1969 to 2009). Kay also founded the Scottish Corpus of Texts and Speech and published work on historical semantics and lexicography, and contributed metaphor and semantic annotation based projects on the Historical Thesaurus of English dataset.  Biography = Early life  Kay was educated at The Mary Erskine School in Edinburgh. She completed a MA in English Language and Literature at the University of Edinburgh, before continuing on to Mount Holyoke College, Massachusetts, USA. After this Kay took on English language teaching in Sweden, as well as professional lexicography.  Professional career  Kay first arrived at the University of Glasgow as a research assistant. At the age of 27, she became one of four co-editors and in 1979 she became a full-time lecturer in the English Language Department. Of her career, Professor Kay is quoted as having said, > \\"I never intended to be an academic. I worked in journalism, English- > language teaching and publishing before becoming a research assistant and > then a lecturer at Glasgow. The common thread is an interest in language.\\" Recognised as an efficient and effective academic leader, and an ambitious, yet selfless scholar, over the course of her career, Kay had under her employ in 233 researchers and production staff. In 1995 Kay and Jane Roberts published A Thesaurus of Old English, and in 1996 Kay was promoted from Senior Lecturer to Professor. Kay was the original convenor of the board of Scottish Language Dictionaries (SLD), which was formed in 2002. Retiring in 2005, Kay remained active in the facilitation and research in Thesaurus-derived projects. She continued to actively support the completion of the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary which was published on 22 October 2009. Kay is credited to have created the first computer laboratory for English studies in the world, developing cutting-edge teaching software, and first of its kind research-led courses in literary and linguistic computing. In 2013, the University of Glasgow awarded her Professor Kay an honorary D.Litt. for her outstanding contribution service to the study of the English language.  Work on the Historical Thesaurus of English  In 1989, when Professor Samuels retired, Kay became Director of the Historical Thesaurus project. The result of 44 years of work, the HTOED received critical acclaim and was awarded the Saltire Society Research Book of the Year Award in 2009. In review by The New York Times, the commentator noted, > \\"historians, sociologists, philosophers and literary critics will soon > wonder how they got by for so long without it... indispensable.\\" Randolph Quirk, Emeritus Quain Professor of English Language and Literature at University College, London reported, > \\"Forty five years of exacting scholarship by a well-led team have had a > triumphal outcome. This book is a magnificent achievement of quite > extraordinary value. It is perhaps the single most significant tool ever > devised for investigating semantic, social, and intellectual history.\\" An overwhelming success, the HTOED has generated significant royalties allowing for a legacy of funding for postgraduate studentships continuing research into the linguistics of English and of Scots.  Death  Kay died in 2016 at the age of 76. She is survived by her sister and brother. She requested no funeral.

She uses elements from both Korean music and Western contemporary composition techniques.  Career  Woo was born in Seoul in 1974. Her father was an artist, her mother a pianist. She graduated from Sungshin Women's University. In 1995 she became composer in residence with the Seoul Ladies' Singers, conducted by Hak-Won Yoon whom she had met singing as a student in the Yongrak Presbyterian Church Choir which he also conducted. She received a commission to compose a missa brevis for women's choir to be performed on an Asia tour in 1996. From 1999 she composed for the Incheon City Chorale, also conducted by Yoon. In 2002 she composed Gloria for a concert tour of the Asian Youth Choir. She wrote an oratorio, Moses, in 2011. In several works, she combines influences from Western contemporary music and from Korean traditional music, creating new Korean choral music. The musicologist Yoonchung Chang analysed the combination specifically for Gloria in a 2012 thesis. Traditional elements include scales and rhythmic patterns. She also uses Sikimsea, Korean melodic ornaments with \\"subtle shading and nuance of tone using degrees of vibrato and sliding of pitch\\". Another characteristic element is the distinction of vibrato, often reserved for the main note of a scale, and non-vibrato. The vibrato is different on a long note, which should be sung first \\"in a straight style and then begin to vibrate slowly over a wide range, becoming increasingly faster and narrower\\", and on short notes when it begins right away. Woo taught music at the Seoul Theological University and Hansei University. She has taught at the Chorus Center Academy in Seoul and is a guest lecturer at the University of Michigan. Her works have been performed internationally. Her oratorio Creo on the Creation was performed as part of the 10th World Symposium on Choral Music in Seoul in August 2014, conducted by Hak-Won Yoon. It was given its US premiere by the Manhattan Chorale conducted by Craig Arnold in New York on 18 October 2016, and its European premiere in Reims, France, by the Choeur Nicolas de Grigny in November 2016.

It can deliver substantial benefits and advantages to its partners. It has been known as a cooperative strategy when one or more companies or business units work together to create mutual benefits. There are two main types of supply chain collaboration, vertical collaboration and horizontal collaboration. Vertical collaboration is the collaboration when two or more organizations from different levels or stages in supply chain share their responsibilities, resources, and performance information to serve relatively similar end customers; while horizontal collaboration is an inter- organizational relationship between two or more companies at the same level or stage in the supply chain in order to allow greater ease of work and cooperation towards achieving a common objective.  Different forms and approaches of supply chain collaboration = Collaborative communication  Collaborative communication is the contact and message transmission process among supply chain partners in terms of frequency, direction, mode, and influence strategy. Open, frequent, balanced, two-way, multilevel communications indicate close inter-firm relationships.  Collaborative Execution  Collaborative execution is the process of executing supply chain transactions in a collaborative manner. Suppliers will work with Buyers to ensure the right quantity is delivered in the right time as per the contract. As the purchase order goes through a life cycle of order to delivery, at each stage there need to be a tight collaboration between the trading partners for the correct and efficient execution  Coordinating contract  Coordinating contract is defined as a coordination mechanism that provides incentives to all of its members so that the decentralized supply chain behaves nearly or exactly the same as the integrated one, by specifying contract parameters such as quantity, price, quality and deadlines, contracts are designed to improve supplier-buyer relationship.  Information sharing  Information sharing is the extent to which a firm shares a variety of relevant, accurate, complete, and confidential ideas, plans, and procedures with its supply chain partners in a timely manner.  Joint decision making  Joint decision making refers to the process where supply chain partners orchestrate decisions in supply chain planning and operations that optimize supply chain benefits.  Joint knowledge creation  Joint knowledge creation is the extent to which supply chain partners develop a better understanding of and response to the market and competitive environment by working together.

Early life and education  Renwick was born at 32 Kelvin Drive, Glasgow, on 6 January 1889, the youngest of five children of Jane Renwick (née Lindsay), a teacher of English, and William Kirkwood Renwick, a mercantile clerk. Raised in the family home at 12 Arlington Street, Glasgow, he was educated at the local Woodside School. Although, Renwick always maintained strong links with Glasgow, he had a strong affinity to the Borders where his paternal grandfather was a shepherd near Garvald. In October 1907, he enrolled at the University of Glasgow and graduated with an ordinary MA degree on 10 June 1910 having taken classes in mathematics, logic, and moral philosophy. His contemporaries at University were Walter Elliot, John Boyd and George Buchanan Smith. He was active in Union discussions, contributed to debates, and in literary societies such as the Mermaid Club. He was also subeditor of the University Magazine 1909-1910 and some of his contributions appear in two anthologies of the University of Glasgow verse. In the 1910/11 session, he took classes in English and History, graduating with first class honours in English. In 1912, he was awarded the George A. Clark Scholarship which allowed him to study French and Italian at the Sorbonne, Toulouse and the British School in Rome.  First World War  With the outbreak of World War I, Renwick joined the tenth battalion of the Cameronians (The Royal Scottish Rifles) on 27 September 1914. He experienced trench warfare with this regiment and rose quickly in the ranks to become a Captain, serving at home and in France where his battalion took part in the Battle of Loos. After experiencing this particularly devastating attack, according to his entry on the University of Glasgow’s Roll of Honour, he felt ‘like a ghost, an old ghost, sceptical and disillusioned.’\\" Six months later, he was invalided and sent home for hospital treatment. Thereafter, he undertook instructional duties. On 11 October 1917, Renwick married his fellow University of Glasgow graduate, Margaret Lang, at Eastwood Parish Church. Margaret’s brother, Arthur Lang, another Glasgow honours graduate, was killed in action in August 1916.  Interwar years  Renwick returned to civilian life in 1919 and studied at Merton College at the University of Oxford and was awarded with a B.Litt degree for his thesis on the renaissance poet, Edmund Spenser. He then returned to Glasgow where he lectured for a short spell at the University of Glasgow; residing at 32 Keir Street, Pollokshields. It was during this period of 1920-21, that he enrolled for one year in evening classes at Glasgow School of Art to learn bookbinding. Following this, William moved to Newcastle-upon- Tyne to become Professor of English Literature at Durham University in 1921. In April 1926, he was awarded a DLitt by the University of Glasgow for his thesis, Edmond Spenser : an essay on Renaissance poetry, and received an honorary doctorate by the University of Bordeaux in 1934. He remained Professor of English Language and Literature at King's College, Durham University, for 24 years from 1921 to 1945.  World War Two and later life  Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, William joined the Home Guard where he was made a commander. He also spent a year in China as a visiting Professor, lecturing with the British Council on a tour of Chinese Universities offering support to academic staff from 1943-1944. Following the end of the war in 1945, William was appointed Regis Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at the University of Edinburgh. Moving to a new home in Edinburgh overlooking Arthur’s Seat, he was to remain in this role until he retired in 1959. The sub-department of English for Foreign Students was established in this period and he was also involved in the setting up of the School of Scottish Studies in 1951. In 1953, Renwick was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Law by the University of Glasgow. He died on 25 November 1970, aged 81, in an Edinburgh hospital. The Renwicks left 26 works of art to the University of Glasgow in 1986/7 through the bequest of William's wife, Margaret, in 1985. The collection highlights in particular the Scottish artists of the twentieth century.

In parallel she's actively pursued archeology and writing, and in later life contributed new interpretations on early European civilizations.  Background and education  Adele Hankey was daughter of Robert Hankey, 2nd Baron Hankey. From 1948 to 1953 she studied ballet at the Elmhurst Ballet School with a focus on art and design, as well as theatre at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. From 1960 to 1963 she took a series of design courses under Paul Colin, and studied art at the Académie Julian and with André Lhote at his studio. In 1972 she studied television and film at the College of San Mateo.  Career  Änggård has had a long and prolific career in theatre, contributing to some 80 productions between 1957 and 2000. Her designs were often noted for an essential simplicity, which integrated the visual part of a performance with the drama and acting as a whole.

Later, as an extension of her theatrical career – so as to better understand Greek play scripts – she studied archaeology at Södertörn University, receiving a bachelor's degree. Following extensive research, she published A Humanitarian Past in 2016. The book adds a sophisticated social dimension to early European history, and challenges modern conceptualizations of the earliest European ancestors as being underdeveloped and prehistoric art as primitive.

Nevo Syndrome is caused by a NSD1 deletion, which encodes for methyltransferase involved with chromatin regulation. The exact mechanism as to how the chromatin is changed is unknown and still being studied.Kanemoto N, Kanemoto K, Nishimura G, et al. (December 2005). “Nevo syndrome with an NSD1 deletion: A variant of Sotos syndrome?” 140A (1) 70-73.

American Journal of Medical Genetics. 76: 67-70 Overgrowth syndromes are characterized with children experiencing a significant overgrowth during pregnancy and also excessive postnatal growth.Cohen M, Neri G, Weksberg R. Overgrowth Syndromes. New York: Oxford University Press; 2002. Studies concerning Nevo Syndrome have shown a similar relation to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder. Nevo Syndrome is associated with kyphosis, an abnormal increased forward rounding of the spine,Newton, J. (2015). “Kyphosis: Causes, Methods of Treatment and Potential Complications”. 7. joint laxity, postpartum overgrowth, a highly arched palate, undescended testes in males, low-set ears, increased head circumference, among other symptoms. Signs and symptoms One of the most prominent and visible symptoms of Nevo Syndrome is the prenatal overgrowth, which continues into the infant and toddler stage. This excessive weight gain can be attributed to the low concentrations of growth hormone and insulin growth factor that are normally present to regulate weight gain. Other common symptoms associated with Nevo Syndrome are the outward wrist-drop, edema in hands and feet, undescended testes, low-set ears, hypotonia, the presence of low muscle tone in children,Soucy E, Wessel L, Gao F, et al. (March 2015). “A Pilot Study for Evaluation of Hypotonia in Children with Neruofibromatosis Type 1”. 30(3): 382-382. and long tapered fingers, and a highly arched palate. Diagnosis Nevo Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder. Most times in which a child is afflicted with Nevo Syndrome, both their parents are of average height and weight. It is only until after birth when the characteristic physical traits associated with disease are manifested, and the disorder is actually diagnosed. One study showed that despite the increased growth rates, the patient was completely healthy up until age 6, when he was admitted into the hospital. Nevo syndrome is usually associated with early childhood fatality. Children with Nevo Syndrome have a high occurrence of death due to cardiac arrest because their developing hearts cannot keep up with their overgrown body. TreatmentHistory Nevo Syndrome is considered to be a rare disorder. Since its first appearance in 1974, only a handful of cases have been reported. Studies have shown showing similarities between Nevo Syndrome with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome as well as Sotos syndrome. There is an astounding overlap of phenotypic manifestations between Nevo Syndrome and the more frequent Sotos syndrome, which are both caused by the NSD1 deletion. Sotos syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition associated with learning disabilities, a distinctive facial appearance, and overgrowth.Tatton-Brown K, Rahman N.

It is located on 16 Kaļķu iela, Riga. The Mikhail Chekhov Riga Russian Theatre (known before 2006 as Riga Russian Drama Theatre) was founded in 1883, making it the oldest Russian- language drama theatre outside Russia. The original troupe consisted of sixteen actors. The theatre grew during the 19th century and had something of a golden age during the leadership of K.N. Nezlobin, prior to the Russian Revolution. The theatre continued to operate after Latvia became an independent country following the Latvian War of Independence (1918-20). During the subsequent Soviet occupation of Latvia, the theatre continued to operate, but had to adapt to the political censorship of the day. It did not put on any performances during World War II. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the re-establishment of Latvian independence, the theatre can once more offer a mix of classical plays and new, innovative plays. In 2006, it was named after Michael Chekhov, who spent two years in Riga (1932-1934) and influenced the Latvian theatre and performing arts. Since the 8 January 2018, the theatre has been led by Dana Bjorka, general manager and member of the board.

Pulgram, a Holocaust survivor, began his career in the late 1940s, drawing concrete details and wall sections as he worked on construction documents at Finch Alexander. As his career progressed, he began to specialize in corporate interiors, as a number of interior designers did. This esteemed group includes Davis Allen, Florence Knoll, Margaret McCurry, and Margo Grant Walsh. Pulgram's philosophy was that interior design is a continuation of the architecture of the space and needs to be carefully designed and contracted for; he was an advocate for architecture firms moving into the area of commercial interiors. In 1963, he created his own firm – Associated Space Design. The focus of his firm was interiors – he was known for his corporate environments including Coca-Cola and Black & Decker. His book, Designing the Automated Office, focused on how technology was changing the office environment and how architects should design for that. He worked tirelessly throughout his career to create interior contract documents – which are still used today. Childhood and WWII William Pulgram was born on January 1, 1921 in Vienna, Austria to Sigmund Pulgram (tailor and manager of a fine clothing store) and Giselle Bauer Pulgram. He had two siblings, a younger sister, Lilli, and older brother, Ernst. Life in the United States His brother, Ernst, had already made it to America and served in the United States Army until he was released on medical leave. William enlisted and served with special services entertainment, playing the piano. He served for three years ending in 1946. He served in McPherson and Los Angeles. Education In 1946, he attended Georgia Institute of Technology, at twenty five years old, and graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1950. He studied under the G.I. Bill. William meets his wife, Lucia, while studying at Georgia Tech. He continued his education at Ecole des Beaux Arts where he won first prize for design. Career He then joins the firm Cecil Finch Alexander in Atlanta where he begins working on creating contract documents for the firm's interior projects. He then creates a subsidiary firm of Finch Alexander Rothschild and Pascal focusing on interiors. He leaves and begins his own firm – ASD, for the design of interior spaces –in 1963. His firm focuses on the development of corporate environments such as Southern Bell, Coca-Cola, and Black & Decker. His firm works to insure they respond to the needs of the employees as well as their automated working tools. He is currently the chairman emeritus of ASD. He spend time consulting internationally on architecture and facility planning with an emphasis on effects of the information based society. Associated Space Design William Pulgram started his company as the interior design department of Finch, Alexander, Barnes, Rothschild, and Pascal, where William stayed for five years. William Pulgram had built up a first rate interior design firm while contributed to it as a designer and leader in the field of interior design. It became its own firm in 1963. It is one of the largest interior design firms in the country. The firm does not market itself, work is obtained by referral. Associated Space Design offers complete design services, including product and graphic design. Some of ASD's projects include corporation offices, banks, public institutions, and a number of government jobs. Interiors Contract Documents In 1972, he is the chair of a taskforce for the AIA documents committee for developing interiors contract documents. This committee was full of members of the AIA and ASID. In 1975, he is the chairman for the AIA's pioneering Interiors Committee, within two years. The committee developed contract documents and start publishing information on starting a practice, differences between interiors and architecture practice, client relationships and obtaining new work. The Interiors Committee now has nearly 1,500 members when it begun it has almost fifty. Book In 1984, Pulgram and Richard Stonis wrote the book, Designing the Automated Office, which focuses on the need to plan for new technologies in offices. Their book discusses how the design community must educate itself on office technology and how it will affect the way offices work. They believed there were six factors: flexibility, human factors, project team, spacing planning, building systems, and furnishings that affect the design of the automated office. Programming for machines becomes necessary as well as the design and layout of workstations to focus on the productivity and comfort of the worker. The book contains workstation suggestions and different desk set ups for different task jobs. The book addresses different office layouts and the effect on communication between employees. They also discuss electricity, how lighting affects people and costs, acoustics and its effects on people/privacy, as well as wall assemblies and new furniture technology. Their book won the Designer's book club of the month award and was later translated into Japanese. Projects Previously the Pulgram Residence, the Huff-Feldman House was built in 1953, it is 3,000 square feet. It was remolded in 1955,1958 and again once it was purchased by the Feldman's and restored by Margaret Gilchrist Serro and interior designer Herbert Brito in 2000. It is one of only five houses designed by Pulgram. In 1970, he created the TRM (task response module) System. Eppinger Furniture, INC used in opening planning for offices. TRMs are similar to wall units in homes used to hold decorations, books, and stereos. A TRM can hold any necessary item while also allowing the occupant to add items to make them feel more comfortable. Tampa Electric Company in Tampa, Florida. 1979. A main focus was the atrium overlooking offices. Old Post Office in Washington, D.C. 1979. An adaptive restoration, the first project of its type in the U.S. government, it was completed as part of the Pennsylvania Avenue Redevelopment Project. Hurt Building Redevelopment in Atlanta, Georgia. 1985. Ground floor arcade and art gallery. Alma Desk showroom in Atlanta, Georgia. Associated Space Design created a space where each showroom has a different perception of the community. ASD allows the space to form different spaces. The spaces created double as offices for the showroom staff. McDonald's Oak Brook headquarters is an interiors project where Pulgram removed the desks, and replaced them with task response modules that hold telephones, create writing spaces, drawing boards, and typewriters. There are few doors or walls, the space is separated by TRMs and cabinets. He created a ‘think tank’ where a hidden door led visitors to a small arena with a waterbed in the floor- where they can relax and take time to take care of their minds – creating a space where they can be creative. The space is created with irregular shapes and padded walls. Awards He was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and a member of the American Society of Interior Designers, The National Committee on Interiors, the Architectural Research Council, the AIA Foundation, and the Atlanta Arts Association. Personal life With his wife Lucia (1925–2020),Lucia Fairlie Pulgram obituary he had four children, Christopher, Anthony, Laurence, and Dierdre. Christopher was a violinist with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Anthony was an opera singer with the New York City Opera, and Laurence worked as an attorney in San Francisco. He died in April 2020 at the age of 99. Conclusion In the aftermath of World War II, Mies van der Rohe and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, were building modern office blocks across the globe. Multinational corporations were drawn to them. It was not immediately clear how modernism would be applied in the realm of office interiors. Pulgram is one of those who provided an answer. The now ubiquitous open office plan, with workstations, file banks, and low-height partitions needed an advocate and a philosophy, and Pulgram stepped into the void.

He is trying to associate himself with the sangat so that the work of the sangat will come in the coming time. Baba ji was a resident of village Jagatpur but his parents' name was not known even in Shergill clan. His wife's name was Kajali, and he had three sons, 'Raja ji', 'Bhaga ji', 'Jaga ji'. Whenever there is talk of the Chowk Mela, its beginnings and history begin with Baba Ji. One day Baba Ji encountered the entire server of Lakhdata Ji's servants. He asked what you do in Bhai, whose name do you ask and where do you go, and whom do you adore, they answered the question and said that we are the servants of millions of governing associations. And we ask in His name, whatever pleases Him with a sincere heart, His desires are fulfilled. He rides in millions of jobs, pays for everyone. Even then it is called the Giver of Millions. Baba ji said that if my wishes were fulfilled then I would ask him, what are your demands. Baba ji - If I give a little of my cattle then I will give that extra wine to millions of donors. The servants prayed in earnest for six prayers and Bhai Ram Singh also prayed before the donor. Years went by while doing such labor. As the months passed, Bhai Singh Ji continued to serve the horse, and began to heal the time. Then, when the time came, the horse gave a very beautiful appearance, and the mind itself was very happy. That millions of donors have heard. Then those days come, in the month of thugs. Servants would think and say in their heartfelt words: \\"Jut is very good-hearted, so that no one gets angry and the giver hears.\\" . When the servants met with Bhai Ram Singh, they asked what Sardar ji Chhodi gave, then he said that my donor ji had listened, the jhodi had given extra, so the happiness of the servants was no limit. Kotti-koty thanked you and said that thank you maid for keeping our shame. But then Baba ji bole bhai sevak is such that it is worth many millions but if I give Manu a little more, he should give to his Guru, Anandpur, Guru Ji too should be cheated. The servants then prayed, complaining that you have a desire for your name, please put the shame of our poor as before. With such prayers, the servants left for the next village, returning to their homes as they filled the outposts, hitting the floors of Pir Jussa, saluting Multan Panchase and bowing at the court. The following year, the little ones made a difference, and when the servants of the millions came to know, there was no limit to their happiness. Bhai Ram Singh also made up his mind to go out to the posts. Your wife, Kajali Ji, prepared herself for the trip. He started the village journey and the first phase of the Sangha was at Bada village. The first Lakdatta ji changed his face to beg for himself at Bada village and said, \\"Your request of the horse has been fulfilled. . Baba ji said that it was not possible to meet this pillar and then the next journey to Bhutar began. Likewise, from Bada village to Boparao, Roarka Kalan, Vadalas, Jandiala Manjki, Boparaya Donna, Heran, Khanpur Khandpur, Khondpur, Khondpur, Khondpur. ) And the next stage is Talwandi Choudhury. Lakh donor ji changed his face several times in the face and asked for his horse but he did not rush and said that Pir himself would come and cheat. Once Pir came to change the face of identity and asked for horses with Rohb but he was not scared and answered his questions and said that Pir himself would come and cheat. The sangat likewise crossed the Beas river and filled the outposts from the adjoining villages and proceeded to the next stage by watering. The river crosses Beas to Goindwal, Fatehabad, Naurangabad, Kot Dharmachand, Sarai Amanat Khan and Pir Raza Tal and beyond to Multan. Baba ji and other sangat also made Multan Panchha, Sajda Salam, paid their vows and asked for other prayers Baba ji tied the horse with a tree and started waiting for Pir Ji. Kept waiting It is said that there used to be a dog that Pir ji also came in disguise and demanded horses, but he refused. At last the Sakhi Sultan, the son of Multan, the son of Multan, the son of Mata Mum and everyone who filled the pockets of his brother, completed the examination of his servant and made a conspiracy in front of Baba Ji. Baba ji saluted himself and continued to look after the donor for a long time. Then he cheated the donor but Pir Ji said that horses should not be taken like this, if they were to be taken like this, they would have taken a very village. Take this horse, we will come to Anandpur Sahib and take it from you. Likewise, he returned to the village, promising to visit Anandpur and shared the whole conversation with his family.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Sam Alden and Jesse Moynihan, from an outline by Ashly Burch, Moynihan, showrunner Adam Muto, Jack Pendarvis, and head writer Kent Osborne. The episode, which debuted on May 12, 2016 on Cartoon Network, guest stars Melissa Villaseñor as Grob and Justin Roiland as Lemongrab. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Normal Man (voiced by Tom Kenny) asks for Finn and Jake's help in order to save his brother, Glob (voiced by Kenny). Eventually, Glob and Normal Man are able to make amends, and Normal Man returns to Mars to ascend the Martian throne. \\"Normal Man\\" was the final episode of Adventure Time to have been storyboarded by Moynihan. Initially, he contemplated working on the episode alone, but Muto convinced him otherwise. The original story that Moynihan developed was much darker, but eventually a lighter plot was agreed upon. Upon its airing, the episode was seen by 1.38 million viewers and received largely positive reviews from critics, with Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club applauding the episode's consideration of forgiveness. Plot=Background Hundreds of years before the events of the series, Magic Man (voiced by Tom Kenny) was a brilliant magician and scientist from Mars. However, after a magical accident, he lost his mind and developed the nihilistic tendency to spread chaos. As such, he was banished to Earth by the King of Mars (voiced by Pendleton Ward) and Magic Man's four-headed brother, Grob Gob Glob Grod (whose heads are voiced respectively by Melissa Villaseñor, Tom Gammill, Kenny, and Miguel Ferrer). In the sixth season episode \\"Astral Plane\\", Grob Gob Glob Grod sacrificed their body to stop a comet from destroying Mars, leaving the planet rulerless. Later, in the episode, \\"You Forgot Your Floaties\\", another magical accident removed the magic, madness, and sadness from Magic Man's warped brain, reverting him to his original self. However, since he can no longer perform magic, he takes on the moniker Normal Man. Events Normal Man is determined to make amends with his brother Glob, whose head is currently in orbit around Earth, so he sends Tiny Manticore (voiced by Kenny) to retrieve his brother from space. Upon successfully retrieving Glob, Tiny Manticore reveals to Normal Man that he is going to steal the head away to a dangerous mountain so as to make Normal Man suffer for all the pain he inflicted in the past. Normal Man is despondent and calls on the aid of Finn and Jake. The trio brave the terrors of the mountain, and successfully reach its summit, only for Tiny Manticore to drop Glob from the peak. Normal Man dives after his brother and grabs him; as they free-fall, the two make amends. Tiny Manticore sees that Normal Man has indeed changed, and so he saves the two. Normal Man, grasping the head of Glob, then uses a Martian transporter to beam themselves to Mars. En route, Glob bites Normal Man's hand, causing him to drop the head. Glob says that the days of Mars being ruled by Grob Gob Glob Grod are over, and that it is time for Normal Man to rule the planet. Once on Mars, Normal Man attempts to woo the terrified citizens of the planet with brownies. They do not trust him at first, but it is suggested that they embrace him as their leader. Production This was the final episode of Adventure Time to have been storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan. \\"Normal Man\\" was storyboarded by Sam Alden and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Ashly Burch, Moynihan, Adam Muto, Jack Pendarvis, and Kent Osborne. Supervising direction for the episode was carried out by Andres Salaff, whereas Sandra Lee handled the episode's art direction. This was the final episode of Adventure Time that Moynihan worked on. Moynihan, who had been a storyboard artist on the show since the second season episode \\"Crystals Have Power\\", left the show in order to finish his web comic Forming.Moynihan, Jesse (Storyboard artist). 2013. \\"Crystals Have Power\\" [Commentary track], Adventure Time Season Two [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Cartoon Network. Alden noted that the episode was \\"a thematically appropriate cap to [Moynihan's] run on\\" the series, and that the two of them \\"were both happy with how it turned out.\\" Moynihan had originally thought about storyboarding the episode by himself, but Muto convinced him otherwise, for near the conclusion of season six, Moynihan had specifically asked Muto to persuade him against pursuing solo storyboards in the future. Ultimately, Moynihan felt that storyboarding the episode with Alden was a good choice, and on his personal website, he mused that \\"Normal Man\\" was the best episode that he and Alden produced together. Because this was going to be his last episode, Moynihan desired to help come up with the story. Originally, he wanted it to be much darker, and focus on Magic Man, Margles (Magic Man's former wife, voiced by Gillian Jacobs), and Betty (Simon Petrikov's fiancée, voiced by Lena Dunham in seasons five and six and Felicia Day in season nine). Hoping to distance himself from the dark tone that characterized season six, however, he chose to pursue a different story about Magic Man being forced to live as a \\"normie\\" and eventually reclaiming the Martian throne. In this episode, Tom Kenny plays the roles of Normal Man, Tiny Manticore, and Glob. Series creator Pendleton Ward also voices Lumpy Space Princess, as well as Abraham Lincoln. Finally, the episode guest stars Melissa Villaseñor as Grob, and Justin Roiland as Lemongrab. Reception \\"Normal Man\\" aired on May 12, 2016. It was seen by 1.38 million viewers and scored a 0.4 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic (Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States), which means that the episode was seen by 0.4 percent of all individuals aged 18 to 49 years old who were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club compared this episode favorably to the preceding eighth season episode “Bun Bun”, pointing out that the two installments deal with characters making amends for past wrongs. This in turn led him to note, \\"People’s capacity for change has been a recurring theme of Adventure Time's [eighth] season, and it’s a big reason why the show has maintained such a high standard of quality.\\" Sava was also complimentary towards the scenes that take place on the mountain, likening them to “one long platformer [video game] with a bunch of really cool opponents.” Andrew Tran of Overmental noted that because Magic Man had been a representation for \\"the cruel randomness of waking life, the tragedy of bad things happening senselessly to good people\\", there is a certain irony in the fact that Normal Man suffers so much in this episode. The suffering that Normal Man must endure is a direct response to his previous actions as Magic Man, and so he goes on a \\"'holy mountain'-style ordeal\\" to spiritually renew himself and cleanse himself of the \\"original sin\\" that he technically did not commit (for it must be remembered that Magic Man's personality and behavior was engendered by magical accident), but for which he nonetheless must pay. In the end, \\"Normal Man prove[s] his sincerity, and so inherit[s] the Earth (or more precisely, Mars).\\" Explanatory notesReferencesExternal links * * Category:2016 American television episodes Category:Adventure Time (season 8) episodes ","title":"Normal Man"},{"id":"52161096","text":"Joseph John Sotak (February 9, 1914 – December 11, 2007) was an American professional basketball player.

Claire and TFail) was an American musician and artist who specialized in street art.  Biography  Tina St. Claire was a self-taught artist whose easily distinguishable work could be found throughout the city of Los Angeles, sometimes on abandoned structures or alongside graffiti. St. Claire displayed her work in over 100 gallery spaces throughout the U.S. She was also featured in Juxtapoz in 2012. St. Claire's art often complimented her partner, fiancé and frequent collaborator, Dereck Seltzer. Often shown together, his work leans on the masculine and sharp side of aesthetic while St. Claire's lingers in the darkness but lives in the light, feminine edge of contemporary street culture. Her creations are heavily infused with mysticism and street art style. With a background in wheat pasting and mural-style street art, her design-heavy artistic style, whether on panels, canvas, skateboard decks, or paper, is heavily informed by the street. Most of her pieces surround the female form or face, and a ghostly energy with crystals, skulls, and pupil-less eyes peering into the depths of your soul. With fangs, sharp jaw lines, and a feminine strength that is unmatched, her work stands out from the crowd of other L.A. artists. Together, the collaborative works of Dereck and Tina—or Haunted Euth and TFail is unmistakable and hypnotic. St. Claire is remembered as an illustrator above all else, but she also worked with high end clients, studios, companies and organizations, and she taught herself a multitude of disciplines in order to be the best artist she could. Her work tends to be multi-disciplinary in her style and technique. She created thousands of pieces of art in her lifetime that varied from full paintings, sketches in her moleskin journals, silk screen print editions, numerous legal and illegal street installations, stickers, tapestries, zines, clothing of her designs, and fine art.  Music  St. Claire first picked up a guitar when she was 13. Her inspiration for doing so came from bands such as Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Silverchair. She joined her first real band around 15, and hung around with that band until she was 18. They toured the mid-western U.S., played shows in Hollywood and all over California, but ultimately, it didn't progress into anything bigger. She left that band and started her own band, called LiaFail in July 2003. With a strong desire for an all girl line-up, and a passionate grouping of musicians including Mikaela Mayer, Nita Strauss, Henry James (aka Heather D. Welborn) and Kirsten Schlüter. The band toured the US a few times and played a number of well known clubs, events, and festivals including Warped Tour multiple times in the United States before disbanding (in 2008). It was through the band that she adopted the name TFAIL—a reference to the band's namesake. Lia-Fail was not a “cause” band nor did they shy away from heavy subjects. They'll address the serious issues of today but not in any way you'll expect. Their last concern was image and their first concern was having a kick-ass time playing shows and making great music. Playing typically male-dominated types of music was like walking a fine line for them. They were constantly fighting the “chick” stereotypes, but wanted to be watched and valued for their music more than their bodies. They were not the typical female band in that they were not afraid to bring the pain and heaviness and were not concerned with being “ladies.” These girls just wanted to play shows and have a good time doing it, according to a press release from the band back in 2006.  Artwork  ; TMRWLND TMRWLND (spoken as \\"Tomorrow Land\\") is a hardcover book that also exists as a compendium of all three issues of the zine by the same name, made by St. Claire and Seltzer. Established in 2013, TMRWLND morphed from a zine project into a full-time creative studio entity and working space. The collaborative zine project and book highlighted the two artists’ individual talents and distinctive individual styles of art and art-making. The artists used techniques such as inking, drawing, silkscreen printing, and hand painting, in TMRWLND. The artwork of the TMRWLND zines and book showcases this complimentary relationship between TS Claire's and Dereck Seltzer's styles, with imagery that is self-curated to represent their individual bodies of work. ; Street art St. Claire created many large scale hand painted pieces that she installed around the city of Los Angeles. The work was instantly recognizable and stylistically unlike anything being done in L.A. at the time. Every piece was drawn, painted and installed by hand. She utilized wheat pasting, graphic design, silk screening, acrylic, spray and enamel painting in her work on the street, and stood out as a force in the L.A. street art scene with her distinctive style. Most of her pieces surround the female form or face, and a ghostly energy; crystals, skulls, pupil-less eyes, peer into the depths of your soul. With fangs, sharp jaw lines, and a feminine strength that's unmatched, her work stands out from the crowd of other L.A. artists. ; Fine art St. Claire's paintings, drawings, and mixed media works could be spotted a mile away—there weren't many other artists with such striking style during her heyday. Tina's work often featured “feminine” color schemes, but with strong and sometimes jarring images of women skulls, symbolism, cats, crystals, and other personally significant imagery to Tina. Her paintings were shown all over the country, and were collected at reasonable prices by people all over the world. Her pieces evoked a kind of inspiring and powerful feeling in their audience. The subjects in most of her paintings and drawings were life forms of some kind, whether animals, animal skulls or women, and they always had empty eyes, full of power and promise, of mysticism and magic. Her online following was enormous, and helped her artwork sales and popularity. Her Tumblr, Instagram, blogspot and other social media sites were constantly flooded with great content, messages, and fantastic original works of art, whether in-progress or completed. Her fiancé Dereck Seltzer curated a memorial exhibit of her last series of work called “Eternal” in April 2016, at the Surf Club Gallery in Hollywood, presented by The Artillerist. ; Collaboration with Dereck Seltzer Tina St. Claire and Dereck Seltzer (Haunted Euth) met in October 2011 and began dating and working together creatively shortly after. The two partnered on murals, installations, pop-up shows and the now internationally published book TMRLWND, despite having very little to almost no backing or support from the contemporary Los Angeles art scene. Over the next five years, their installations and murals could be seen in the Downtown L.A. Arts District, Culver City Arts District and along Sunset Boulevard most frequently. Seltzer proposed to Tina St. Claire shortly before her hospitalization for cancer treatment in 2016. He stayed with her day and night while she resided in the hospital and actively worked to raise money to support her medical bills through a Gofundme Campaign.  Charity  St. Claire devoted countless hours to helping to try and balance the gender and racial inequalities in the art world, both on the street and in the gallery; and she has worked independently to create artwork, imagery and content that represents those who have been marginalized or looked over by society as a whole, bringing awareness and thought to valid current social issues. St. Claire painted a large mural for Temple Magnet School (LAUSD) for which she received a letter of recognition from the school board and Los Angeles. She also hand-painted numerous skateboard decks for charity which were auctioned off to help the Venice Family Clinic in Los Angeles. “She believed wholly in the individual’s power to change the world and she did so herself, donating monthly (in secret no less) to charities that supported animal rights, peace, and the idea of equality for people of all color and genders.”  Death and legacy  St. Claire passed away as a result of Gliobastoma Multiforme grade 4 on March 9, 2016 in Los Angeles. Her recently published book TMRWLND is now available internationally, through Not A Cult publishing. There is a second book of her art in the works, currently untitled, curated and designed by her fiancé Dereck Seltzer. There is currently an \\"untitled\\" documentary about her life and art in production with Director Rich Ragsdale at the helm. There is charity being developed as well, in her name, that uses the TMRLWND art that she and Dereck Seltzer created together and gives its profits to Glioblastoma Multiforme research.

The Lumière brothers used a cinematograph to film this motion picture in Seville, Spain. Plot Procession at Seville and bullfighting scenes depicts the traditional Spanish Holy Week celebration, portraying Spain in the 19th century. This recording includes a traditional parade and bullfights in Spain, representing how this holiday was celebrated at the time. At the beginning, the short film shows the Procession Parade from the Christ of Sorrows. This celebration occurs during Holy Week in Seville which is celebrated one week before Easter. It includes decorated chariots that are pulled around the city streets by Costaleros. The Penitentes, dressed in tunics and a cape, march together in the procession along with the chariots and other people wearing traditional and formal clothing During the bullfighting celebration, the Banderillero entertains the bull and plays with it, meanwhile a Picador (Lancer) enters the spectacle. The Picador is riding a horse and manages to stab the bull. The short film displays the process of bullfighting and how each participant plays their specific role, as well as the traditional parade. Production and development=Production To create the short film, the Lumière Brothers used a cinematograph, a new projection device which was beginning to be used at that time. The brothers sent different equipment all over the world in order to film a variety of scenes and images. Two of the main filming locations were France and Spain. This short non-fiction film marked the first time that someone filmed the Spanish Holy Week. Distribution and reception The first 1,000 copies of this film were distributed by Auguste and Louis Lumière. Procession at Seville and bullfighting scenes was found later on a 16mm reel and a videocassette, along with other 46 Lumière films.

MASCSG was first described by Skálová et al. in 2010. The authors of this report found a chromosome translocation in certain salivary gland tumors that was identical to the (12;15)(p13;q25) fusion gene mutation found previously in secretory carcinoma, a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.  Fusion gene  The translocation found in MASCSG occurs between the ETV6 gene located on the short arm (designated p) of chromosome 12 at position p13.2 (i.e. 12p13.2) and the NTRK3 gene located on the long arm (designated q) of chromosome 15 at position q25.3 (i.e. 15q25.3) to create the (12;15)(p13;q25) fusion gene, ETV6-NTRK3. This mutant fusion gene also occurs in congenital fibrosarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, secretory breast cancer (also termed juvenile breast cancer), acute myelogenous leukemia, ALK-negative Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, and radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma.Majewska H, Skálová A, Stodulski D, Klimková A, Steiner P, Stankiewicz C, Biernat W. \\"Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary glands: a new entity associated with ETV6 gene rearrangement.\\" Virchows Arch. 2015 Mar;466(3):245-54. doi: 10.1007/s00428-014-1701-8. Epub 2014 Dec 12. The MASCSG gene codes for the transcription factor protein, ETV6, which suppresses the expression of, and thereby regulates, various genes that in mice are required for normal hematopoiesis as well as the development and maintenance of the vascular network. The NTRK3 gene codes for Tropomyosin receptor kinase C (also termed TrkC or TEL), the receptor for neurotrophin-3. TrkC is a RTK class VII tyrosine kinase receptor. When bound to neurotrophin-3, it becomes active as a tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate cellular proteins and thereby stimuulate cell signaling pathways that lead to cellular differentiation and growth while inhibiting cellular death. TrkC makes particularly important contributions to development of the central and peripheral nervous systems. NTRK3 forms chromosomal translation-mediated fusions with many other genes in addition to ETV6 to form fused genes that are associated with the induction of a wide range of cancers including those of the lung, thyroid gland, colon, rectum, and brain. ETV6-NTRK3 fusion genes in some MASCSG disease cases display atypical exon junctions and may be associated with more tissue infiltrating disease and less favorable clinical outcomes.  Fusion protein  The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene's product, ETV6-NTRK3 protein, contains the N-terminus of ETV6 that is responsible for its dimerization/ polymerization ETV6, a step required for it to inhibit transcription. The protein's C-terminus contains the C-terminus of the TrkC. The fusion protein lacks transcription regulating activity but has dysregulated, i.e., continuously active tyrosine kinase activity. In consequence of the latter effect, the fusing protein continuously stimulates pro-growth and pro-survival pathways and thereby the malignant growth of its parent cells.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma occurs somewhat more commonly in men (male to female ratio of <1.5:1.0). Patients with this disease have a mean age of 46 years although ~12% of cases occur in pediatric patients. Individuals typically present with symptomless tumors in the parotid salivary gland (68%), buccal mucosa salivary glands (9%), submandibular salivary gland (8%) or in the small salivary glands of the lower lip (5%), upper lip (4%), and hard palate (4%). Histologically, these tumors are described as have a morphology similar to secretory breast carcinoma; they typically having one or more of the following histological patterns: microcystic, papillary-cystic, follicular, and/or solid lobular. Other histological features of these tissues include: the presence of eosinophilic secretions as detected by staining strongly for eosin Y; positive staining with periodic acid-Schiff stain (often after diastase); the presence of vesicular oval nuclei with a single small but prominent nucleolus; and the absence of basophilic Haematoxylin or zymogen granules (i.e. vesicles that store enzymes near the cell's plasma membrane). The cited histology features are insufficient to distinguish MASCSG from other Salivary gland neoplasms such as acinic cell carcinoma, low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma, and adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified. MASCSG can be distinguished from these and other histologically similar tumors by either tissue identification of a) the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene using Fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction gene detection methods or b) a specific pattern of marker proteins as registered using specific antibody- based detection methods, i.e. MASCSG tissue should have detectable S100 (a family of calcium binding proteins), Mammaglobin (a breast cancer marker, Keratin 7 (an intermediate filament found in epithelial cells), GATA3 (a transcription factor and breast cancer biomarker), SOX10 (a transcription factor important in neural crest origin cells and development of the peripheral nervous system), and STAT5A (a transcription factor) but lack antibody-detectable TP63 (a transcription factor in the same family as p53) and Anoctamin-1 (a voltage sensitive calcium activated chloride channel).  Clinical course and treatment  MASCSG is currently treated as a low-grade (i.e. Grade 1) carcinoma with an overall favorable prognosis. These cases are treated by complete surgical excision. However, the tumor does have the potential to recur locally and/or spread beyond surgically dissectible margins as well as metastasize to regional lymph nodes and distant tissues, particularly in tumors with histological features indicating a high cell growth rate potential. One study found lymph node metastasis in 5 of 34 MASCSG patients at initial surgery for the disease; these cases, when evidencing no further spread of disease, may be treated with radiation therapy. The treatment of cases with disease spreading beyond regional lymph nodes has been variable, ranging from simple excision to radical resections accompanied by adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, depending on the location of disease. Mean disease-free survival for MASCSG patients has been reported to be 92 months in one study. The tyrosine kinase activity of NTRK3 as well as the ETV6-NTRK3 protein is inhibited by certain tyrosine kinase inhibitory drugs such as Entrectinib and LOXO-101; this offers a potential medical intervention method using these drugs to treat aggressive MASCSG disease. Indeed, one patient with extensive head and neck MASCSG disease obtained an 89% fall in tumor size when treated with entrectinib. This suppression lasted only 7 months due to the tumor's acquirement of a mutation in the ETV6-NTRK3 gene. The newly mutated gene encoded an entrectinib-reisistant ETV6-NTRK3 protein. Treatment of aggressive forms of MASCSG with NTRK3-inhibiting tyrosine kinase inhibiting drugs, perhaps with switching to another type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug if the tumor acquires resistance to the initial drug, is under study.STARTRK-2  References  Category:Salivary gland neoplasia Category:Oncogenes ","title":"Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma"},{"id":"52161247","text":"Bernard Reymond (7 January 1933) is a Swiss pastor and theologian, honorary professor of practical theology at the Romand pastoral Institute of the University of Lausanne, which belongs to the current of Liberal Christianity.

It originally aired on ABC on March 29, 1973 as part of the network's ABC Theater series. Essentially a videotaped stage production, Pueblo was the story of the capture and imprisonment of the crew of USS Pueblo, a US Navy vessel captured while spying off the coast of North Korea, in 1968. The production starred Hal Holbrook as Captain Lloyd Bucher, commanding officer of Pueblo. The structure of the play consists of Captain Bucher answering questions of two tribunals, with the scene switching back and forth between his interrogations by the North Koreans and the inquiry by the US Navy (after his return) into his possible misconduct in the Pueblo Incident. As Bucher describes incidents during the capture of the ship and during the crew's subsequent captivity, the viewer is shown re-enactments of the same. At the 26th Primetime Emmy Awards, the program and its performers were nominated for seven awards and at the ceremony on May 28, 1974, won five. Holbrook won two Emmy Awards for his performance in Pueblo, one as Best Lead Actor in a Drama and another for Actor of the Year. Director Anthony Page was nominated for Best Director in Drama a Single Program but did not win. The program won technical awards for Film Sound Editing, Film or Tape Sound Mixing, Video Tape Editing, and was nominated for Technical Direction and Electronic Camerawork. Pueblo received critical praise, with the New York Times stating, \\"Pueblo succeeds powerfully as television\\".

Previously he was associated with the UK Independence Party (UKIP); he contested its leadership in November 2016, coming third with 18.1% of the vote, and again in 2017, coming fourth.  Personal life  Rees-Evans was born in Hampshire and educated both in the UK and overseas, including at the Jeppe High School for Boys in Johannesburg. Since 2011 he has lived in Penrhiwceiber with his family and has a professional background in business, particularly adventure tourism. Controversially, he once claimed that a \\"homosexual donkey\\" had tried to rape his horse. He clarified his statement, saying that \\"I was asked to respond to quite a bizarre statement ... and so I tried to give the only kind of answer I knew how to give because, frankly, I do not have any experience of homosexuality, or humans copulating with animals.\\"  Political career  He contested the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth in the 2015 general election, receiving 13.8% of the vote, with a swing of 11.2% to UKIP. Rees-Evans declared his candidacy for UKIP leader on 24 October 2016. He has pledged to ensure the UK leaves the EU and that the government is reduced in size and function. He believes that the current political class in Westminster is out of touch with citizens, and pledged to make politics more transparent and open if elected UKIP leader. Rees-Evans differed radically from the other candidates, advocating the introduction of direct democracy first within UKIP and then seeking to use it with intention to cause massive reform of the entire UK political system. He also supported capital punishment for child killers and sexual abusers of children, but only if the victims were \\"pre- pubescent\\" and looked under the age of 18 (the age of consent in the UK is 16 years), saying that 13-year-olds were \\"fair game for the current punishment\\". Rees-Evans has said that he opposes same-sex marriage. He was the last remaining Faragist candidate in the race, which was won by the self-described \\"unity candidate\\" Paul Nuttall. He walked out of tightly-controlled hustings after being told \\"not to rock the boat\\", and then embarked on a nationwide tour of membership similar to that of Nigel Farage prior to the 2016 EU membership referendum. The late Sam Gould, former chairman of UKIP's Caerphilly branch, commented: \\"Policy-wise he is similar to Raheem. John is a gentleman and has done so much for UKIP, helping them produce party political broadcasts and has raised a lot of money for the party, too.\\" In August, Rees- Evans announced a proposal to offer £9,000 and health insurance to Britons with dual nationality, in return for them moving to countries where they have the right, or could obtain the right, to settle. They would be required to start a business and trade with the UK, exporting products that the UK did not manufacture. This would be to help achieve \\"negative net immigration towards one million a year\\", reduce UK living costs post-Brexit, and would initially be funded by cutting the foreign aid budget. He was condemned by rivals Whittle and Collins. Both Collins and Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake compared the proposal to the BNP's manifesto, however, when interviewed by Asian Voice, Rees-Evans explained that the initiative was inspired by the decision of his father in the late 1970's to leave the UK to start a business in Africa, that there was nothing in his original comments that in any way alluded to the race of prospective candidates, and that this inference was manufactured without justification by his political opponents. He finished fourth in the 2017 UKIP leadership election. He later quit the party to form his own group, \\"Affinity\\". After quitting UKIP, Rees-Evans joined the Democrats and Veterans party instead of forming his own party and assumed leadership of the party.

Founding  Prior to 1998 the Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association (CSAA) operated as a grassroots community based organization and focused much of its efforts on organizing school reunions for former Shingwauk Indian Residential School students. These reunions invited former staff, students, and community members connected to the Shingwauk School to return to the School site, talk about their experiences, and connect with other members of the survivor community. The Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association (CSAA) held its first official meeting in 1998 and established an office at Algoma University College in the same year. The Shingwauk Project and the CSAA also established the Shingwauk Healing Project in 1998, dedicated to sharing, healing and learning in relation to the legacy of residential schools.  Shingwauk Reunions  The first Shingwauk reunion was held in 1981 at Algoma University College on the former site of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School. Ten years later, in 1991, the second Shingwauk reunion was held on the same site. Advertised as \\"Shingwauk Reunion 1991: 160th anniversary of Chief Shingwauk's Vision\\" the event resulted in hundreds of residential school survivors, community members, politicians, clergy, and residential school staff gathering at Algoma University College. The 1991 event also marked a shift in the discussion of life residential schools and many of the former students began to speak out about their experiences, including the abuse at the Shingwauk School. The third gathering of the former students and staff of the Shingwauk School was held July 4–7, 1996. At this reunion the Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association issued a \\"Declaration of the Shingwauk Reunion 1996\\" in which the former students pledged themselves to the fulfilling the vision of Chief Shingwauk and the ongoing work related to healing and education. This declaration and subsequent activities resulted in the formal establishment of the Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association.  Relationship With Algoma University  The organization has a longstanding relationship with the administration of Algoma University and other partner organizations located on the historic Shingwauk site. The CSAA has two seats on the board of the Shingwauk Education Trust, are represented on a number of internal Algoma University committees such as the Anishinaabe Peoples' Council, and holds a seat on the Algoma University board of governors. In 2006 the relationship between Algoma University and the Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association was formalized through the signing of an articles of agreement which governs the relationship of their partnership. This document also outlines governance of the CSAA archival collection held in the Shingwauk Residential Schools Centre in partnership with Algoma University. Since 2006 the CSAA has continued to be involved in University decisions relating to Indigenous communities, reconciliation, and residential schools. The 2017 Algoma University statement on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada drew heavily on the experience of the CSAA and committed the University to marking the history of the survivors of the Shingwauk Residential School.  Programming  In 2003 CSAA became a founding partner of the National Residential School Survivor Society, a national organization which provided a survivor advocacy voice during the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement process. In the following year the CSAA was selected by Indian Residential Schools Resolutions Canada to act as the Ontario site for the Alternative dispute resolution pilot project. From 2008 to 2014 the CSAA held the Ontario portion of the Health Canada health and cultural support worker contract in relating to the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement. This included providing health and cultural support services at community and commemoration events, at national Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada events, and as part of the Independent Assessment Process under the settlement agreement. In 2014 the Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association cut ties with this program and this work was taken over by Ontario Indian Residential Schools Support Services. In 2012 the CSAA in partnership with Shingwauk Kinoomaage Gamig launched the Charlie Hunter Scholarship fund for residential school descendants who are studying at Algoma University. The scholarship is in memory of Charlie Hunter, a student who passed away while at St. Anne's Indian Residential School. Charlie was buried at the residential school against the wishes of his family and the Hunter family worked for over thirty years to bring Charlie's body back to his home community. In 2011 Charlie's body was finally returned to his home community of Pewanuck, Ontario. Past winners of the scholarship have included: Frank Belleau (2015), Mitch Case (2015). In 2016 the Children of Shingwauk Alumni Association through the work of the Shingwauk Residential Schools Centre partnered with the Archives of Ontario to contribute to the \\"Family Ties: Ontario Turns 150\\" exhibit which featured content relating to the Shingwauk family and Shingwauk Residential School.  Logo and Commissioned Artwork  The CSAA logo utilizes the public domain image of Chief Shingwauk from the 1850 Robinson-Huron Treaty signing. Chief Shingwauk was a signatory to the 1850 Robinson Huron Treaty and the Shingwauk Indian Residential School was named after him. Since 1981 CSAA has commissioned a number of local Indigenous artists to create artwork to be used in promotion and educational programming. This artwork is currently part of the Shingwauk Residential Schools Centre archival holdings and is on display in Algoma University.

McKee's parents died when he was fourteen forcing him to quit school and take care of his brothers and sisters. McKee married Minnie Jackson in 1939 and went to work as the head mail clerk with Horton Motor Lines. He also began tending bar at various restaurants around Charlotte, where he eventually got the idea to start the Excelsior Club, the first night club for African Americans in the Charlotte area. In 1944 the first African American club became a reality when McKee bought a house on Beatties Ford Road. He renovated the house in new Art Moderne style complete with a dining and banquet room as well as a bar. The club became a favorite place for civil rights activists to meet during the 1950s and 1960s. The club hosted many famous musicians including Nat King Cole and local player Wilbert Harrison who started out at the Excelsior Club before rising to national fame. The club became the leading private black social club in the Southeast and the largest one on the East Coast. Community leader \\"Genial Gene\\" Potts, the WGIV radio host, made the club his informal base of operations. A variety of men and women's social clubs also called the Excelsior home as well as African American fraternities and sororities. After McKee started the club, he became a successful Charlotte businessman, contributing to Johnson C Smith University, NAACP, Colored NC Police Association, Democratic Party and YMCA. McKee was awarded man of the year in 1957 by the Charlotte Post newspaper. McKee died from cancer on July 25, 1985 at the age of 72. Upon his death Ken Koontz made sure the club continued. Representative William \\"Pete\\" Cunningham purchased the Club becoming the sole owner of the Historic Excelsior Club in 1988-2006. He sold it in 2006 to Civil rights attorney James Ferguson and his family bought the club and continues to run and maintain it. As of May 2017 the wife of former Rep. Pete Cunningham, Carla Cunningham has become the sole proprietor. The Club was designated as a historic property in 1986.  References External links * McKee Papers:J.

Description A kronkåsa is a drinking vessel where the handles are exaggeratedly long and elaborate, thus forming a kind of crown above the cup, hence the name. The crown cups made during the Renaissance were carved from a single root of spruce trees. Later copies from the 19th century were made using other types of wood. The decoration of the crown is likely derived from forms found in the woodwork details of imported late Gothic altarpieces. Many of the cups were painted brightly red. History Kronkåsor were used in Sweden during the Renaissance as a form of elaborate drinking vessel among the Swedish nobility. Although little is known of their origin, it has been suggested that they reflect an old tradition of elaborately carved wooden drinking vessels popular in Northern and Eastern Europe. The popularity of kronkåsor during the 16th century coincides with a breakthrough in the quality and popularity of wood carving as an art in general in Sweden. According to Olaus Magnus, writing in his A Description of the Northern Peoples in 1555, kronkåsor were made in south-western Finland (at the time part of the Swedish realm) and possibly in Västerbotten. About 20 kronkåsor survive to this day, most of them preserved in museums. Many of them are intimately connected to the Bielke family. When the Swedish National Heritage Board was created in 1630, its objective was to preserve ancient monuments and cultural heritage, including kronkåsor. Usage Kronkåsor were probably used during festive occasions and seem to have been only used by members of the nobility.

From 1894 to 1916, it served as venue for various exhibitions and festivals, as well as a field for USC Trojans football games. History Fiesta Park was located in a block bordered by Grand Avenue, 12th Street, Hope Street, and Pico Boulevard. This lot had originally belonged to Victor Ponet, a banker and undertaker who also founded Evergreen Cemetery. From 1894 to 1916, it served as a venue for La Fiesta de Los Angeles, a springtime parade and festival celebrating Los Angeles' multicultural heritage. In 1901, then-President William McKinley was an honored guest at the Fiesta during a trip to the West Coast. Around the turn of the century, the grounds were used for a variety of sports and entertainment events, ranging from football and baseball games to pony races to a production of \\"Faust\\". A number of minor league baseball teams played at Fiesta Park, including the Los Angeles Trilbeys and Los Angeles Echoes. The grounds served as the home field for the Los Angeles Rangers soccer club, a side composed primarily of expatriate Englishmen. In 1910, Fiesta Park was covered with a canvas big top and pressed into service as the venue for the Los Angeles Auto Show. This event coincided with a move by many of the California schools from football to rugby, so following the 1910 Auto Show, Fiesta Park was used primarily for tented exhibitions, though bleachers were restored in time for the 1916 football season. Following World War I, the festival was discontinued and the grandstands were transported to Bovard Field. Football The USC Trojans (then called the Fighting Methodists) played several football games in the 1890s and all of their 1916 home football schedule at Fiesta Park. Fiesta Park also served as a home field for St. Vincent's College (now Loyola Marymount University)'s football team. Occidental College also played some home games in the stadium, as did numerous high school teams, particularly Los Angeles High School (then located Downtown on Fort Moore Hill) and Polytechnic High School. In the first decade of the 20th century, USC played LA High annually, with the game usually being played at Fiesta Park.

DaLuz was born in Hanford, California. His works have been published in art periodicals, such as American Art Collector, Fine Art Connoisseur, The Artist, Professional Artist, The Huffington Post and Poets and Artists magazine, where he received the cover for the Nov 2009 Issue. Considered \\"ethereal and transcendent\\", his artwork has been said to combine \\"a spectacular dissertation on light and shadow with a brilliant collection of colors\\".
