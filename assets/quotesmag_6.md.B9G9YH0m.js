Burnham, who was apparently a wealthy man, lived in three different houses in the area from the 1670s to 1703. This is house is believed to be one that he purchased from Samuel Poad in 1677, based on what is known of the various properties and related transactions. The main body of the house exhibits no exposed evidence of its 17th century origins, but analysis of its structure reveals a set of features that make it nearly certain that it was built well before 1700. These diagnostic features include unusually large rooms, of a scale comparable to others in Ipswich, a spacing between joists that is distinctive to pre-1683 Ipswich houses, and a relatively steep roof pitch. Most of these features were covered over by alterations made to the interior during the Federal period, and the building's attic space has been finished over. A two-story ell was added onto the back of the house in the 19th century, and a porch was added in the 20th. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

It was developed and sold by ICD, Inc. in 1987-1993, and many years later picked up by the third-party community SpartaDOS X Upgrade Project, which still maintains the software.  History  SpartaDOS X is named after its predecessors, SpartaDOS 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 (also ICD products), and enjoys good level of backward compatibility with the older SpartaDOS software. But it is not, contrary to what can be thought considering the name and the version number, a newer version of SpartaDOS 3.0. It was a completely new system, written from scratch. SpartaDOS X 4.0 was originally developed by Michael Gustafson in 1987-89,Atari 8-bit FAQ http://faqs.cs.uu.nl/na-dir/atari-8-bit/faq.html and shipped on 64k ROM cartridges by ICD, Inc.ANTIC VOL. 7, NO. 11 / MARCH 1989 / PAGE 15 http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n11/spartados.html up to version 4.21. The cartridge contained an additional cartridge slot on itself, so that it was possible to plug-in another cartridge, such as ICD's R-Time 8 battery-backed clock, a language cartridge (Action!, MAC/65 etc.) or a game cartridge, and use it in conjunction with the DOS. In 1992 Atari Corp. dropped all the official support for their 8-bit computers, and so did ICD shortly after that. The rights for the 8-bit ICD inventory were purchased in November 1993 by Michael Hohman, officially as Fine Tooned Engineering. FTE released a slightly updated version 4.22 on 5 November 1995, and, after two or three years, disappeared together with all the items and rights it owned. Ten years later development of SpartaDOS X, then considered abandonware, was picked up by its enthusiasts, as SpartaDOS X Upgrade Project. It resulted in several unofficial revisions of the software, incorporating many of the utilities written since 1992, cleaning many identified problems and including numerous improvements. the published versions are: * 4.31 (2005) * 4.39RC (2006) * 4.40 (a leaked-out beta, 2006) * 4.41 (Feb. 2008) * 4.42 (Dec. 2008) * 4.43 (Apr. 2011) * 4.44 (Jun. 2011) * 4.45 (Nov. 2011) * 4.46 (Jan. 2013) * 4.47 (Feb. 2015) * 4.48 (Jul. 2016) * 4.49 (Apr. 2020)  Characteristics = General  SpartaDOS X is a non-multitasking operating system intentionally modeled after and closely resembling MS-DOS in look and feel. It consists of the kernel, the system library, several types of drivers, the shell (called COMMAND.COM) and a number of utility programs. SpartaDOS X is written in 6502 machine language and fits into a 128k file-oriented ROM cartridge.  Supported storage devices  SpartaDOS X disk editor utility There is full support for Atari- type serial disk drives as well as for parallel hard drives, as long as they conform to Atari standards (i.e. as long as they use the \\"plug-and-play\\" Parallel Bus Interface (PBI) mechanism implemented in the ROM OS of the XL/XE computers). For those which do not, and for ramdisks and the like, up to four block-device drivers can be installed. Nonstandard hard disk interfaces are handled by specialized drivers. The maximum number of drives (or hard disk partitions) connected at the same time is 15 as of version 4.40 (9 in earlier versions).  Kernel built-in functions  The kernel allows to open files and directories in read-only, write-only, write-append and read-write modes. It also maintains environment variables, and programs may request files to be searched through directories specified in $PATH. The variables also control some settings for the DOS as well as for programs, for example the format of date and time to be displayed (the choice is between the \\"European\\" DD-MM-YY and 24-hour clock, and \\"American\\" MM-DD-YY and 12-hour clock).  The file system drivers  Thanks to some form of virtual filesystem, practically any filesystem can be directly accessed, if an appropriate filesystem driver exists and was loaded to the memory. Up to eight such drivers can be installed at a time. The main filesystem driver (fitting within less than 4.5 KB) can search directories (FFIRST/FNEXT), read/write files (FREAD/FWRITE), retrieve or change the current position within a file (FTELL/FSEEK), retrieve the file's length (FILELENG), delete files and directories (REMOVE/RMDIR), rename files and directories (RENAME/RENDIR), make directories (MKDIR), change attributes in files and directories (CHMOD), change current directory (CHDIR), retrieve path to current directory (GETCWD), collect information about the disk (GETDFREE), and make a binary file bootable (SETBOOT). It also maintains the queued buffer cache that can hold up to 16 sectors (8 KB) at a time.  The SpartaDOS file system  SpartaDOS X 64-column text mode The proprietary file system format, called SpartaDOS FS (unrelated to and not compatible with MS-DOS FAT), offers full support for subdirectories, MS-DOS-like attributes (AHPS: Archived, Hidden, Protected, Subdirectory), modification date and time stamps, random access to data within a file, sparse files. The file naming convention is 8+3 (this scheme, inherited from CP/M, is normal on Atari). The directory structure is hierarchical, there are no other than practical limits in nesting directories. A directory can contain up to 1423 entries of files and other directories. The file system is 16-bit: a drive can contain up to 65,535 logical sectors (sector 0 does not exist on Atari disks). The logical sector size is 128 or 256 bytes in earlier versions, and 128, 256 and 512 bytes as of v. 4.40. This makes a maximum capacity of 16 MB per partition in earlier versions, and 32 MB as of v.4.40. A 4 GB per disk ‚Äì by making sector clusters, up to 65,536 bytes per cluster ‚Äì is theoretically possible, but not yet implemented.  The DOS library  The system library contains a binary loader supporting standard, address-dependent Atari binaries as well as SpartaDOS X address-independent (\\"relocatable\\") binary files. It also facilitates such tasks as error handling, parsing the command line, as well as managing memory, file and device resources etc. The library also contains a menu-driven disk formatter, that can be invoked at any time, not only from the DOS' Command Processor, but also from within an application program. The entire library occupies 24 KB of the cartridge (in three banks, 8 KB each) and can be switched off as necessary to release some memory.  COMMAND.COM  The SpartaDOS X default user interface is a command-line interpreter with the same name as the one used by MS-DOS: COMMAND.COM. The SpartaDOS X COMMAND.COM program is less than 4 KB and includes roughly 45 internal commands such as DIR, CD, DEL etc. I/O redirection uses \\"<<\\" and \\">>\\" instead of \\"<\\" and \\">\\" of UNIX and other systems (this is because the \\">\\" sign is the SpartaDOS native path separator). Pseudo-pipelines are available as of SpartaDOS X version 4.42. Batch files can contain structured conditionals such as IF ... ELSE ... FI, GOTO, GOSUB, procedures, and loops. The environment variable $COMSPEC may point to an alternative command-line interpreter, to be loaded instead of COMMAND.COM.  Commands, utility programs and optional extensions  SpartaDOS X Menu utility Additional utility, called RUNEXT, allows to associate data types with programs to be invoked automatically, when the user enters the name of the data file at the DOS prompt and hits the Return key. A program called MENU facilitates complex file management tasks and can serve as a replacement shell. Other utilities allow to change disk names, search disks for files, undelete them, install keyboard buffer, edit system files (CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT) and so on. A port of ARC provides file compression facilities. Among the dedicated programs, which are not directly available on the cartridge and thus are not bundled with DOS itself, there are disk editors available as well as utilities to check and repair filesystem consistency. The following commands are supported by SpartaDOS X. SpartaDOS X 4.48 User Guide * APPEND * ARC * ATR * ATTRIB * BASIC * BLOAD * BOOT * CAR * CD * CHDIR * CHKDSK * CHTD * CHVOL * CLR * CLS * COLD * COMMAND * COMP * CON * COPY * CREDIR * CWD * DATE * DEL * DELDIR * DELETE * DELTREE * DEV * DF * DIR * DIRS * DUMP * ECHO * ED * ERASE * FIND * FMT * FORMAT * KEY * LESS * LOAD * MAN * MAP * MD * MDUMP * MEM * MENU * MKDIR * MORE * PATH * PAUSE * PEEK * POKE * PROMPT * PWD * RD * REN * RENAME * RENDIR * RMDIR * RS232 * SAVE * SET * SETPATHS * SIOSET * SORTDIR * SWAP * TD * TIME * TYPE * UNERASE * VER * VERIFY * X  Configuration  At startup, a text file called CONFIG.SYS is read from the boot disk. The contents of the file decides, which memory the DOS will use to keep the bulk of its code and drivers (the choice is between the extended memory and two areas of the conventional 64K), how many files can be opened at a time, the size of the buffer cache and its location in the memory (same choices as for the DOS code), the default environment variables, and which drivers to load. Apart from the \\"main\\" one, there can be up to 9 alternative configuration files (or 19 as of v.4.45). The choice between them is offered at startup in a form of a menu. When no CONFIG.SYS file is present, the default one is loaded from the cartridge. The other default file that can be used for configuration is AUTOEXEC.BAT. It is a batch file that is run by the COMMAND.COM, when the COMMAND.COM is loaded for the first time.  Requirements  SpartaDOS X requires an Atari 8-bit (400, 800 or XL/XE models) computer equipped with at least 48 KB of conventional memory to run, or 64 KB to be truly usable (on a 48K machine there is too little memory left as to execute most programs). The recommended configuration, though, is at least 128 KB of RAM (64k conventional plus at least 64k extended). The DOS can use the extended memory to keep large portion of its code, buffer cache and internal structures thus releasing the conventional memory. The rest of the extended memory can be used for additional drivers or ramdisks.  Relation to other DOS-es for Atari  Unlike its predecessor, SpartaDOS 3.0, SpartaDOS X is not what is commonly referred to as a \\"DOS\\" in Atari 8-bit parlance. The Atari 8-bit Operating System consists of two main parts: the ROM-based \\"OS\\" and bootable \\"DOS\\". The common misconception about that division is that these respective parts correspond to BIOS and DOS on an IBM PC compatible machine. In reality the \\"OS\\" is responsible for communication not only with the block devices (like PC BIOS), but also for character devices, including file- oriented ones (like PC DOS). Consequently, all the file management functions are centralized in the \\"OS\\"-part, and the \\"DOS\\"-part is only one of its subordinated device drivers, that performs on a mass-storage media (like floppy disk). A \\"DOS\\" for Atari, then, typically consists of the aforementioned device driver (called FMS, \\"File Management System\\"), and an application program playing the role of the OS shell. This shell is typically called DUP, \\"Disk Utility Package\\". All the communication between the user programs (including the DUP) and FMS goes through the CIO (\\"Central Input/Output\\") residing in ROM. Such a design has some shortcomings, for example, no typical DOS is able to keep more than eight files opened at a time, because this is the limit imposed by the API of the ROM-based \\"OS\\". Now SpartaDOS X, even though it is registered in the ROM-based CIO as a device driver and (for backward compatibility) performs all typical DOS functions as requested that way, is in fact independent of the CIO. Instead, it has own \\"I/O centre\\" (known as \\"the kernel\\"), not related to the ROM-based OS, with own set of specifiers and drivers for both character devices (like CON: or COM:) and block devices. Under SpartaDOS X programs can perform all the I/O operations through the SpartaDOS kernel bypassing the Atari OS in ROM completely. Thanks to that it was possible to break many of its limitations: e.g. there can be as many as 16 files opened at a time. This also makes SpartaDOS X (unlike, for example, its predecessor SpartaDOS 3.2, or any other DOS for Atari) an operating system, not just another device driver with some sort of a shell.

The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof providing a full third floor and a clapboarded exterior. The front facade is defined by projecting polygonal bays which extend into the roof line, which are joined together by a single-story porch that shelters the centered entrance. The roof is pierced by segmented-arch dormers on the projections, and a gabled dormer at the center, each with bracketed moulded surrounds. Windows in the bays have similar surrounds, with projecting segmented-arch moulded projections above. The porch is supported by square posts, and projects forward beyond the flanking bays and outward to encompass their inner faces. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows. The porch roof and main roof each feature decorative brackets. The house was built in 1875 as a single-family residence, and was only later converted to two- family use. J.E.

He was born in 1668 in Amsterdam. On 19 December 1683, he left for Batavia on board the Juffrouw Anna as an assistant in the service of the Dutch East India Company. He arrived in Batavia on 19 June 1684 and began working in the General Secretariat. He was regularly promoted. In 1686 he was promoted to Accountant, in 1690 to First Clerk to the General Secretariat, and in 1691 to Buyer. In 1696, he was appointed as Secretary to the High Government (de Hoge Regering). In 1700 he became Raad extra-ordinair (Counsellor extraordinary) and President of the College van Weesmeesteren (an orphanage). In 1701 he was named Raad ordinair van Indi√´ (Full Counsellor of the Indies). On 3 May 1703 he became President of the College van Schepenen (Aldermen) at Batavia. Following the death of Governor-General Abraham van Riebeeck, the Council (Raad) chose van Swoll, by a slim majority, as Governor-General (on 17 November 1713). This proposal was sent to the 17 Lords of the Indies (de Heren XVII) on 18 May 1714 who confirmed his appointment in 1715, despite his difficulty character. His honesty was the deciding factor in those times of corruption and maladministration. As Governor-General, he put a lot of energy into dealing with the private, or unofficial, trade. In this he was not really successful. In general, there was nothing particularly remarkable about his time in office. He was no great promoter of development, such as extending coffee farming. He was also against extending the territory of the Company, because he thought it would then become ungovernable. He suddenly dropped the price the Chinese got for tea by a third. The result was that the trade in tea (and porcelain) collapsed for years. Four years after his provisional appointment as Governor-General, he died in Batavia on 12 November 1718\\\\. He was buried in the Church of the Holy Cross (Kruiskerk). His successor was named as Hendrick Zwaardecroon.

Appears on the portrait of Isaac Milles by George Vertue, and on the funerary hatchment of Jeremiah Milles (d. 1797) in Sawbridgeworth church, Hertfordshire. Isaac Milles or Mills (19 September 1638 ‚Äì 6 July 1720) was an English cleric, often described as the model parish priest of that day. Origins Milles was born on 19 September 1638, the youngest son of Thomas Milles, esq., \\"a plain country gentleman\\" of Carrington's Farm, Cockfield, near Bury, Suffolk. He was born and baptised 30 September 1638. The family were however distinguished enough to bear arms, which were: Argent, a chevron between three millrinds sable, with motto \\"Pietate et Prudentia\\". These arms are visible on the engraving of Isaac Milles by George Vertue in the British Museum.Burke's General Armory, 1884; Babbington, Churchill, Materials for a History of Cockfield, Suffolk, published in Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology & Natural History, 1880 Of his elder brothers, Samuel, of Queen‚Äôs College, Cambridge, was a vicar of Royston, Hertfordshire, and John ‚Äòa very considerable tradesman‚Äô at Dedham, Essex. Education After spending seven years at King Edward VI School. Bury, where Lord-keeper North was among his schoolfellows, Isaac was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1656, and graduated M.A. in 1663. His tutor at Cambridge was Francis Turner, afterwards the nonjuring bishop of Ely, who was his lifelong friend. Career On leaving the university Milles took holy orders, and became curate in sole charge of Barley, Hertfordshire, the rector, Dr. Joseph Beaumont, master of Peterhouse, being non-resident. In 1674, by the influence of his friend Chief Baron Atkins, he obtained the vicarage. There he made the acquaintance of Henry Dodwell, and became intimate with Dr. Martin Lluelyn, whose epitaph in Wycombe Church he wrote. While at Cambridge he had met Edward Colman, Titus Oates‚Äôs victim, and seems to have read Colman‚Äôs letters to P√®re la Chaise before they were printed. He came to the conclusion that no popish plot existed, and gave offence by expressing his conviction to that effect in his sermons. It was only the reputation which his high character had won for him which save him from prosecution. In 1680 he was presented by Sir Robert Sawyer to the living of Highclere, Hampshire, where he remained till his death. Milles took pupils there, including the sons of Thomas Herbert, eighth earl of Pembroke, the new proprietor of Highclere. Chief among his friends at this period were Dr. George Hooper, incumbent of East Woodhay and Ashmandsworth, afterwards bishop of St. Asaph and Bath and Wells, and his successor at Woodhay, John Hern, canon of Windsor. For some time he had scruples taking the oath of allegiance after the revolution, Turner the nonjuror appears to have persuaded him to do so. Milles, a strong tory and high churchman, was a model parish priest. The parish register of Highclere describes him as ‚Äòfor 39 years 2 months and 7 days the constant resident rector and pastor of this parish,‚Äô and records his ‚Äòprimitive integrity and piety‚Äô and his charity to the poor. ‚ÄòHe never refused any of his neighbours that desired to borrow any money of him, leaving it to them to take their own time to repay it, without usury.‚Äô He laid out between 400l. and 500l. on the parsonage house and outhouses but ‚Äònever exacted the utmost of his tithes.‚Äô Marriage and children Milles married in 1670 Elizabeth Luckin (died 1708) of Springfield, Essex, who died of smallpox on 4 January 1708. They had children including: *Thomas Milles, eldest son, Bishop of Waterford. *Jeremiah Milles (1675‚Äì1746), fellow and tutor at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1696 to 1705, became rector of Riseholm, Lincolnshire, in 1704, and was rector of Duloe, Cornwall, from 1704 until his death. His son was Jeremiah Milles (1714‚Äì1784), Dean of Exeter and antiquary. *Isaac Milles the younger (fl. 1701-1727), B.A. of Balliol College 1696, graduated M.A. from Sidney Sussex, Cambridge, in 1701, was treasurer of the diocese of Waterford 21 May 1714, and prebendary of Lismore 6 September 1716, but was non-resident, and carried on his father‚Äôs school at Highclere. In 1727 he resigned his Irish benefices to become rector of Ludshelfe or Litchfield, Hampshire. **Richard Pococke, Bishop of Meath, was a grandson.Tours in Scotland: 1747, 1750, 1760, by Richard Pococke, edited with a biographical sketch by Daniel William Kemp, Edinburgh, 1887. Death and burial He died of paralysis on 6 July 1720, and was buried on 9 July in the chancel of Highclere Church, where a black marble slab with a Latin inscription was put up to his memory by his children. A white marble monument with inscription was also placed by his eldest son on the north wall of the chancel. Bromley mentions a rare engraved portrait of him, signed by George Vertue.

The theory describes dynamical phenomena which occur on objects modelled by fractals. It studies questions such as \\"how does heat diffuse in a fractal?\\" and \\"How does a fractal vibrate?\\" In the smooth case the operator that occurs most often in the equations modelling these questions is the Laplacian, so the starting point for the theory of analysis on fractals is to define a Laplacian on fractals. This turns out not to be a full differential operator in the usual sense but has many of the desired properties. There are a number of approaches to defining the Laplacian: probabilistic, analytical or measure theoretic.

Now largely defined by 19th century architectural trends, it includes the city's commercial downtown (Main Street), its civic heart on Dale and Prospect Streets, and some adjacent residential areas. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Gloucester, which takes up much of Cape Ann on the northeastern coast of Massachusetts, was settled by English colonists in 1623. By the early 19th century it was well on its way to become a major fishing port, and the fishery remains an important aspect of its economy. Its downtown area is located on the north side of its inner harbor, east of the southern mouth of the Annisquam River, a tidal river separating the cape from the mainland. This area was shaped to a significant degree by major fires in 1831 and 1868, and has been impacted by 20th-century development and urban renewal. The historic district is roughly divided into three contiguous areas. The commercial heart is located on Main Street, extending eastward from Washington Street to Pleasant Street, and a short way north on Pleasant. The civic core is just to the north, clustered on Dale Street, which runs parallel to and west of Pleasant. Adjacent to the civic core are densely set residences. Running parallel to Main Street to its north is Middle Street, where a number of high quality homes, most built before 1840, are located. At the far western end of Main and Middle Streets are also clusters of densely built residences, extending as far north as Pine Street. Prominent buildings in the district include Gloucester City Hall, an elaborate Second Empire structure built in 1870 after the 1868 fire, and the Front Street Block, a collection of four joined buildings at the western end of Main Street, which were built after the 1831 fire.

It consists of several methods to assign a fractal dimension and other fractal characteristics to a dataset which may be a theoretical dataset, or a pattern or signal extracted from phenomena including natural geometric objects, ecology and aquatic sciences, sound, market fluctuations, heart rates, frequency domain in electroencephalography signals, digital images,Fractal Analysis of Digital Images http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/Fractals.htm molecular motion, and data science. Fractal analysis is now widely used in all areas of science. An important limitation of fractal analysis is that arriving at an empirically determined fractal dimension does not necessarily prove that a pattern is fractal; rather, other essential characteristics have to be considered. Fractal analysis is valuable in expanding our knowledge of the structure and function of various systems, and as a potential tool to mathematically assess novel areas of study.  Underlying principles  Fractals have fractional dimensions, which are a measure of complexity that indicates the degree to which the objects fill the available space. The fractal dimension measures the change in \\"size\\" of a fractal set with the changing observational scale, and is not limited by integer values. This is possible given that a smaller section of the fractal resembles the entirety, showing the same statistical properties at different scales. This characteristic is termed scale invariance, and can be further categorized as self-similarity or self- affinity, the latter scaled anisotropically (depending on the direction). Whether the view of the fractal is expanding or contracting, the structure remains the same and appears equivalently complex. Fractal analysis uses these underlying properties to help in the understanding and characterization of complex systems. It is also possible to expand the use of fractals to the lack of a single characteristic time scale, or pattern. Further information on the Origins: Fractal Geometry  Types of fractal analysis  There are various types of fractal analysis, including box counting, lacunarity analysis, mass methods, and multifractal analysis. A common feature of all types of fractal analysis is the need for benchmark patterns against which to assess outputs. These can be acquired with various types of fractal generating software capable of generating benchmark patterns suitable for this purpose, which generally differ from software designed to render fractal art. Other types include detrended fluctuation analysis and the Hurst absolute value method, which estimate the hurst exponent. It is suggested to use more than one approach in order to compare results and increase the robustness of one's findings.  Applications = Ecology and evolution  Unlike theoretical fractal curves which can be easily measured and the underlying mathematical properties calculated; natural systems are sources of heterogeneity and generate complex space-time structures that may only demonstrate partial self- similarity. Using fractal analysis, it is possible to analyze and recognize when features of complex ecological systems are altered since fractals are able to characterize the natural complexity in such systems. Thus, fractal analysis can help to quantify patterns in nature and to identify deviations from these natural sequences. It helps to improve our overall understanding of ecosystems and to reveal some of the underlying structural mechanisms of nature. For example, it was found that the structure of an individual tree‚Äôs xylem follows the same architecture as the spatial distribution of the trees in the forest, and that the distribution of the trees in the forest shared the same underlying fractal structure as the branches, scaling identically to the point of being able to use the pattern of the trees‚Äô branches mathematically to determine the structure of the forest stand. The use of fractal analysis for understanding structures, and spatial and temporal complexity in biological systems has already been well studied and its use continues to increase in ecological research. Despite its extensive use, it still receives some criticism. = Animal behaviour = Patterns in animal behaviour exhibit fractal properties on spatial and temporal scales. Fractal analysis helps in understanding the behaviour of animals and how they interact with their environments on multiple scales in space and time. Various animal movement signatures in their respective environments have been found to demonstrate spatially non-linear fractal patterns. This has generated ecological interpretations such as the L√©vy Flight Foraging hypothesis, which has proven to be a more accurate description of animal movement for some species. Spatial patterns and animal behaviour sequences in fractal time have an optimal complexity range, which can be thought of as the homeostatic state on the spectrum where the complexity sequence should regularly fall. An increase or a loss in complexity, either becoming more stereotypical or conversely more random in their behaviour patterns, indicates that there has been an alteration in the functionality of the individual. Using fractal analysis, it is possible to examine the movement sequential complexity of animal behaviour and to determine whether individuals are experiencing deviations from their optimal range, suggesting a change in condition. For example, it has been used to assess welfare of domestic hens, stress in bottlenose dolphins in response to human disturbance, and parasitic infection in Japanese macaques and sheep. The research is furthering the field of behavioural ecology by simplifying and quantifying very complex relationships. When it comes to animal welfare and conservation, fractal analysis makes it possible to identify potential sources of stress on animal behaviour, stressors that may not always be discernible through classical behaviour research. This approach is more objective than classical behaviour measurements, such as frequency-based observations that are limited by the counts of behaviours, but is able to delve into the underlying reason for the behaviour. Another important advantage of fractal analysis is the ability to monitor the health of wild and free-ranging animal populations in their natural habitats without invasive measurements.

He served as a Japanese-language intelligence specialist with Merrill's Marauders in the Burma Campaign during World War II, earning a Bronze Star and the Legion of Merit. Matsumoto remained in the Army for 20 years, retiring after a career in military intelligence as a master sergeant in 1963. At the time of his death, he lived with his wife on San Juan Island, Washington. In 1993, Matsumoto was inducted into the U.S. Army Rangers Hall of Fame and four years later was inducted into the Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame.

Rails would be laid eastward from this point in downtown Whitby to Bownmanville. This image shows the eventual fate of the Toronto Eastern in 1927; a CNR train is dismantling the rails between Whitby and Oshawa. The berm of the railway shows up clearly in winter when snow improves the contrast. This section runs through Courtice towards Bowmanville. The railway ran through Oshawa on a separate right of way that has mostly been reused for roads and other purposes. This short section is one of the only portions left in the city. The Toronto Eastern Railway, or Toronto and Eastern Railway, is a noted \\"ghost railroad\\" in southern Ontario, Canada. It was part of William Mackenzie's ambitious plan to provide high- speed electric \\"interurban\\" service throughout the district that first appeared in 1910; however, those plans fell afoul of World War I and, later, political manoeuvres. The railway was incorporated on 4 April 1910 to build a high-speed route from Toronto east to Pickering, Whitby, and Oshawa. The company acquired by Canadian Northern Railway interests in 1911, who extended the proposal east of Oshawa to Bowmanville and Cobourg. They also applied for additional rights of way, north from Cobourg or Port Hope to Peterborough, north from Oshawa to Linsday, north from Scarborough to Markham, Stouffville or Uxbridge, and south from Oshawa to the shore of Lake Ontario.\\"Toronto Eastern Railway Company\\", The Toronto World, 7 January 1915, p. 50 Construction begun on the mainline in 1912, and by 1913 track was in place from Bowmanville to Whitby, when construction halted. In September 1918 the Canadian Northern was nationalized and reorganized as part of the Canadian National Railways (CNR). On 26 December 1923 CNR merged the Toronto Eastern with its other electric holdings to form the new Canadian National Electric Railways. In 1923, existing tracks were reconstructed and new trackage built from Whitby to Pickering, and a few \\"test trains\\" were run. One of these carried the line's only passenger, an uninvited youth who sneaked onto a train in Bowmanville and disembarked when the train reached Oshawa. In 1924, the Provincial government refused to provide the additional funds necessary to turn the project into an operating railway. Although this was largely due to the political infighting of the time, it is fairly certain that the new railway was already obsolete, since the ownership of automobiles (many built in Oshawa) was becoming much more common at that time. The Bowmanville to Whitby section, already fully built and ready for use, was abandoned then, with the railway having never carried a paying passenger. The rails were pulled up during World War II's steel shortages, as were any steel bridges or trestles. Small portions of the railway were used for other purposes for a time. A section in Oshawa was incorporated into the Oshawa Railway Company, and about two miles of track to the Ontario Missionary College (today's Kingsway College) was used between 1924 and 1936 for freight service. After this a short section by Ritson Road was used by McCallum Transport to load cars from the General Motors \\"North Plant\\" in downtown Oshawa.Jennifer Weymark, \\"End of the Oshawa Railway Company\\", Oshawa Express, 2010 Most remaining traces of the railway have disappeared during the relentless \\"suburbanization\\" of the area. One lasting legacy is the alignment of roads in downtown Oshawa; Bond Street, the westbound section of Highway 2 through the city, suddenly turns north for a section, before re-joining King. Between the two is a long empty lot. This land is actually owned by Ontario Hydro, the legal successor to the railway, and carries a medium-voltage overhead line. A small portion of the old alignment is also used in Courtice, Ontario, as the basis for a walking trail, just west of the Courtice Community Complex.

The three plays are Origo Mundi (The Origin of the World, also known as Ordinale de Origine Mundi, 2,846 lines), Passio Christi (The Passion of Christ, also known as Passio Domini Nostri Jhesu Christi, 3,242 lines) and Resurrexio Domini (The Resurrection of Our Lord also known as Ordinale de Ressurexione Domini, 2,646 lines). The metres of these plays are various arrangements of seven- and four-syllabled lines. Ordinalia means \\"prompt\\" or \\"service book\\". (in: Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature) (in: Koch and Minard edd. The Celts) The opening verses of Origo Mundi, the first play of the Ordinalia First play The first play, called Origo Mundi, begins with the Creation of the World, the Fall of Man, and Cain and Abel, followed by the building of the Ark and the Flood; the story of the temptation of Abraham closes the first act. The second act gives us the history of Moses, and the third represents the story of David and of the building of Solomon's Temple, curiously ending with a description of the martyrdom of St Maximilla as a Christian by the bishop placed in charge of the temple by Solomon. An offshoot of the Origo Mundi is the Creation of the World with Noah's Flood (Gwreans an Bys: the Creacon of the World), written in Cornish with English stage directions, copied by William Jordan in 1611. (Appendix I, The Cornish Trilogy, The Death of Pilate Second and third plays The second play, Passio Domini, represents the Temptation of Christ in the desert, and the events from the entry into Jerusalem to the Crucifixion, including the Passion. This goes on without interruption into the third play, Resurrectio Domini, which gives an account of the Harrowing of Hell, the Resurrection, and the Ascension, with the Legend of St Veronica and Tiberius, the death of Pilate, the release of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus from prison, The Three Marys. As in the Poem of the Passion, the pseudo-Gospel of Nicodemus and other legendary sources are drawn upon.

Life Kasper Franck was born in Ortrand, Saxony. His parents were Lutherans, and he was initially a Protestant minister and preacher. Ladislaus von Fraunberg, Count of Haag (de) (1505‚Äì1566), who had recently introduced the reformed faith into his province, invited him to his court. The premature death, however, of Ladislaus prevented Franck from carrying out the proposed plans of reform. Albert V, Duke of Bavaria, the successor of Ladislaus, resolved to restore the Catholic religion, and called in the convert and preacher, Martin Eisengrein. His intercourse with Eisengrein led Franck to an eventual conversion to Catholicism. In 1566, he matriculated at the University of Ingolstadt, devoted himself to the study of the Church Fathers and the early Christian Church, and on 25 January 1568, made a formal profession of the Catholic faith. Albert recognized in him as a man of great usefulness and obtained from Pope Pius V a dispensation to have him ordained a priest. Before beginning his missionary labours, he published a work setting forth the reasons and justification of his return to the ancient faith.\\"Klare vnd Grundtliche vrsachen Warumb M.

In 1572, he was again in the University of Ingolstadt, pursuing his theological studies and the following year he was appointed its rector, which office he again held later for several consecutive terms. On the occasion of the Jubilee in 1575, he set out for Rome, won at Siena a doctorate in theology, and shortly afterwards Pope Gregory XIII conferred on him the titles of Prothonotary Apostolic and Comes Lateranensis.

It is one of the oldest surviving bridges in North America, and is probably the oldest in Massachusetts. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History The stone bridge was built in 1764 with funds provided by the town of Ipswich and Essex County. Construction was supervised by Colonel John Choate, in whose honor the bridge was named. Choate was allegedly the first person to ride his horse over the bridge.William M. Varrell \\"Ipswich\\" (Arcadia Publishing, 2001) In 1838 the single lane bridge was widened to two lanes by adding to the eastern side of the structure. In 1989 the bridge was extensively renovated. There are two known bridges of greater age still in use in the United States: the Pennypack Creek Bridge in Philadelphia, a double arch stone bridge built in 1697, and a single arch stone bridge in nearby Rowley, Massachusetts, built in 1643 and rebuilt in the 19th century. Description The bridge has a total length of , with two stone arches, each spanning . It is constructed out of roughly dressed granite; the original 1764 arches are wide, with the 1838 addition adding . The arch facing of the older portion is finished with lime and mortar, while the newer is dry laid. The older western spandrel wall is fashioned out of heavily chinked rubble, while that on the eastern side is fashioned out of larger blocks that are drill-split rubble. The bridge has low parapets on either side; that on the west is presumed to be original to the bridge's 1764 construction. All of the stone elements have seen numerous repairs and evidence of repointing prior to the 1989 rehabilitation. The central pier has an extended nose on the upstream side of unknown age.

It was listed on the National Register in 1982. Description and history The Cochran House is set back from the north side of Burnham Road, just east of its crossing of some railroad tracks. It is a rectangular brick structure, 2-1/2 stories high, with a side gable roof and twin interior chimneys. A large modern addition has been built to the right of the original structure that rivals it in size. The windows are six-over-six sash, with granite lintels, and the center entry is flanked by sidelight windows. The property also includes a small vintage barn. The house, built in the 1830s, is uncommon because most houses in the area of that period were built of wood. Jehiel Cochran, the builder and owner, was an Andover native who owned a brickyard nearby. Cochran was apparently associated with the brickyard for some time, but was listed as a farmer when he died in 1860.

The Greek Revival building was constructed in 1838, and architect, Richard Bond (1797‚Äì1861). Salem City Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Located on the 2nd floor of Salem City Hall, the City Council Chamber Room serves as the site of bimonthly city council meetings and other regular board and commission meetings. History City Hall was built in 1837‚Äì38 under the supervision of Mayor Leverett Saltonstall and a committee appointed for that purpose. The cornerstone was laid on September 6, 1837. Artifacts buried beneath the cornerstone included copies of local newspapers, the Mayor's speech for the organization of City Government (May 9, 1836), and the new City Charter. The building was enlarged in 1878 by an extension in the rear which did not alter its appearance as seen from the street. The extension doubled the size of the building and brought all existing city offices under one roof. In 1837, under the administration of President Andrew Jackson, the United States Treasury held a surplus in the amount of nearly $40 million. This surplus was distributed to the various states, which in turn distributed this money to the cities and towns. City Hall was built from this surplus revenue, as Salem's share was nearly $34,000. The building and furnishings cost approximately $22,878 and when finished, and this is perhaps one of the few municipal structures in existence paid for without taxing the citizens. City Hall was first occupied by the City Council on the evening of May 31, 1838. A formal dedication was held on June 8, 1838. Since 1837, the building has served as the focal point for the decision making process in Salem. This two-story building was designed and constructed in the style of Greek Revival. The original dimensions were 32 feet high, 45 feet wide and 68 feet long. The side and rear elevations are unadorned brick while the main facade is dressed granite. Three bays wide, this facade is broken by four giant pilasters, one on each corner and one on either side of the recessed center bay. The bays are set with tall windows, 6 over 6. The central entrance is reached by a short flight of granite steps; a cast iron lamp on a bracket projects from above. The tall front double doors are made of mahogany with brass studs outlining the center panels. In 1979 an expansion was done to house city archives. In 2010, an exterior elevator was installed to the back of the 1979 expansion. Handicapped access was installed to help modernize an existing historic public facility and to make Salem City Hall accessible to people with disabilities. These improvements were paid for with $300,000 from the U.S. Government. In 2012 a $2 million restoration was begun that was to be completed in 2013. This renovation will be for total exterior work & the repairs will replace or repair the brick walls, roof and windows on Salem City Hall. City Hall, from Robert N.

Tuller had erected the Hotel Tuller in 1907, and the success of that enterprise led him to build the three Park Avenue hotels in 1924. When constructed, the Royal Palm contained 180 rooms with baths, a restaurant, and five retail spaces on the first floor. However, Tuller overextended himself financially, and in 1928 lost all three Park Avenue hotels in foreclosure. The Royal Palm and the Eddystone were purchased by David P. Katz. Katz owned the building until 1966, when his business empire collapsed.

All three are on the National Register of Historic Places. The Park Avenue Hotel was demolished in 2015. The Eddystone was the first of these hotels to be built. Tuller had already other hotels, and by the early 1920s the northern portion of Park Avenue looked like an ideal place to expand his hotel empire. Tuller hired Louis Kamper to design the hotel on the corner of Park Avenue and Sproat, and the building was constructed in 1924. The hotel had 312 rooms, most of which were rented monthly. Tuller, however, had overextended himself financially in building his hotels, and in 1928 lost all three Park Avenue hotels. Financier David P. Katz purchased the building, and owned it until 1966. However, the area surrounding the Eddystone became more impoverished, and as the neighborhood's fortunes declined so did the Eddystone's.

As UVES call and response volume increased several more station were acquired to help spread resources over the TOU response district. In 1987 a property already owned by the TOU was donated to UVES at Maple Street in Endicott, and soon a station was built, where ambulances and squad members could be stationed. Several response headquarters were located in Johnson City, NY and finally in 1990 a single building was deemed \\"Panko Station\\" (named after Nick Panko for his efforts) which housed additional ambulances and squad members. Out of these three station the entirely volunteer squad responded to a rising call volume of 3,000 calls a year. As call volume again increased exponentially for UVES ambulance services, and in 1992 hired a director of operations who established a third-party billing system.

Built in the early 18th century, it is a rare local example of a plank-framed house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It presently serves as part of a homeless shelter. Description and history The Davis-Freeman House stands on slightly more than on the south side of Essex Avenue (Massachusetts Route 133) in a rural- suburban area of western Gloucester. It's set just north of the Little River, a tidal tributary of the Annisquam River. It's a 2-1/2 story plank construction, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its second story projects beyond the first in front, where the exposed timbers are seen to be hand-hewn, and moulded post heads are visible. The windows and central chimney are the product of a c. 1930s restoration. It's had a few 20th century additions. In 1709 Jacob Davis acquired a grant of land at the head of the Little River, and by 1712 he had built this house and a mill on it. For most of the 18th century the house was used as a hostel and tavern. In 1860 it was purchased by Robin Freeman, an escaped slave, and it remained in the Freeman family until 1929. In that year its original chimney was destroyed in a chimney fire. It was then purchased by Peter Keffer, who undertook the restoration of the property. It now serves as part of a homeless shelter.

Ralaimongo wanted Madagascar to become a French d√©partement and therefore part of France. He came to prominence after 3,000 demonstrated following speeches in a cinema in 1929. Biography Ralaimongo was born in 1885 to a pastor at one of the missions in Madagascar. This was the same year that a treaty was made between the main ruler of the Island and France. The terms of this treaty would serve as a pretext for France to invade ten years later. Ralaimongo became a teacher and after visiting France in 1910 he, like 40,000 of his fellows, served in the first world war. A fifth of these 40,000 did not return, but those who had shown this allegiance to France may have felt that France may also owe them some allegiance. Ralaimongo wanted to be given the chance to be a Frenchman.The French Empire Between the Wars, Martin Thomas, accessed 6 August 2008 In 1913, the Vy Vato Sakelika was formed. Nominally a cultural organisation, the literal translation of VVS as the iron and steel network gives better clues to its intentions. The authorities convinced by its cell network, sentenced some members to imprisonment in 1916 using tribunal power. These sentences were not removed until November 1922. As leaders of VVS, both Ralaimongo and D were watched closely, although Ralaimongo's intentions were not at that time militant. He wanted to see On Madagascar become part of France and saw the naturalisation of his fellow citizens as a gradual way forward. However the authorities tried and convicted him of sedition in July 1922. Faced with imprisonment he went to Paris and became involved with journalism. He founded a paper called L'Opinion which together with other newspapers they arrange to have published in their home state. At the beginning of 1924 Ralaimongo was still in Paris meeting others of a socialist view including the future Ho Chi Minh.African Politics, P.F.Gonidec, 1980, , accessed 8 August 2008 Ralaimongo returned to Madagascar later that year and became involved with labour relations.Country Studies - Madagascar, accessed 6 August 2008 A system was introduced by the French to put forward two committees that would be delegates for the people views, but these people had no power. These committees were called D√©l√©gations √âconomiques et Financi√®res and were a victory for Ralaimongo, but the administration led them strongly, arguing with the colonists views and ignoring the Malagasy. This is regretful as the population gained little experience of democracy.The Cambridge History of Africa: Volume 8: c. 1940 to c. 1975, Chapter 13: Madagascar, 1984, Bonar A. Gow, accessed 6 August 2008 In 1929, 3,000 protesters arose after a meeting at a cinema on 19 May where they heard a speech by Paul Dussac. They gathered around the Governors office in Tananarive where they were armed with sticks and red flags. By the time the next Governor General arrived, L√©on Cayla, the police repressions had made heroes of the leaders of the 19 May demonstration. The new General tried to increase the number of applications approved for French citizenship but it was still very low, and far short of the demonstrators demand for mass naturalisation. Ralaimongo and Joseph Ravoahangy were placed under house arrest in 1930, and not given an amnesty until 1936.Historical Dictionaries of Africa - Madagascar , Philip M. Allen and Maureen Covell, 2005, accessed 8 August 2008 Afterwards Ralaimongo died in 1944 and it was only at the end of the second world war that the French Government allowed some form of democracy. At the end of 1945, two people were elected by the Malagasy to represent them in Paris. These were Joseph Raseta and Joseph Ravoahangy. Both of these were now committed to self-determination for Madagascar. On March 29, 1947 the French put down an uprising in Madagascar.

Early life Rose was born on January 16, 1896 to a playwright, Edward E. Rose. At age 14 she first appeared on the Broadway stage doing various ingenue parts. In 1926, Rose was working as the official historian on a New York Zoological Society expedition to the Galapagos Islands, led by William Beebe. Ernest Schoedsack was working as a cinematographer on that same expedition, just after he had made the film Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life (1925) with Merian C. Cooper. Rose and Schoedsack met there and fell in love. In 1926 they were married. She joined Schoedsack and Cooper in some of their other adventures and productions, including the film Chang (1927). King Kong In the early 1930s, Cooper began development for his film King Kong. He had already gotten two other writers to work on Kong. The first one, Edgar Wallace, died before he could make any significant changes, and the second, James Ashmore Creelman, wrote a screenplay that was too slow-paced, descriptive, and had too much flowery dialogue according to Cooper. So he hired Rose to rework it. Rose cut out many of the long, unimportant scenes that Creelman had written, in order to make it more fast-paced. She is credited with writing such famous lines as \\"Oh, no. It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.\\" She also based the character of Carl Denham on Merian Cooper and Jack Driscoll she based on her husband, Ernest Schoedsack. It was now more like one of the earlier Cooper-Schoedsack adventures. Later life After the success of King Kong, Rose wrote several other movies including Blind Adventure, Son of Kong, She, The Last Days of Pompeii, and Mighty Joe Young, another giant ape adventure. Her Kong screenplay was the basis for two remakes of King Kong, one in 1976 and one in 2005. Rose did not write any more films before her death on June 8, 1978, although she did many rewrites and dialogue changes down through the years. She was survived by her husband and her only child, Peter, born in 1929 with cerebral palsy.

It is mostly located within Hudson Township with a very small portion extending south into neighboring Medina Township. The park was established in 1979, and it encompasses 2,796 acres (4.37 sq mi; 11.32 sq km) surrounding the Lake Hudson reservoir. Lake Hudson is recognized as the first dark-sky preserve in the United States, when it was designated as such in 1993. It is governed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and is operated and maintained by the nearby Hayes State Park in the northern portion of the county. Lake Hudson The main geographic feature of the recreation area is Lake Hudson (sometimes referred to as Hudson Lake). It encompasses 502 acres (2.03 sq km) and has a maximum depth of . The lake was originally three separate smaller lakes called Bear Lake, Covell Lake, and Haley Lake. All three lakes were connected by Bear Creek. The creation of a small earthen dam at the southern end of Bear Lake eventually flooded the area and connected the three lakes, which are combined today as Lake Hudson. Lake Hudson contains a single public access boat ramp. Despite the lake's larger size, the entire lake is designated as a \\"no-wake\\" lake. While motorized vessels are permitted, it is unlawful to move at speeds creating a wake. The lake is a well known fishing destination, as it is frequently stocked by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources with walleye and muskellunge. The largest muskellunge caught in Lake Hudson is recorded in the state's Master Angler Entries at 47 inches (119 cm) long. Several similarly sized muskellunges are also listed. In addition to walleye and muskellunge, other fish species in the lake include black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and yellow perch. Activities Lake Hudson Recreation Area campground The Lake Hudson State Recreation Area includes a semi-modern campground consisting of 50 campsites. The campground features electrical hookups but no sewer connections or shower facilities, and a hand pump is the only source of potable water. There are vault toilets in the campground, boating access site, and the day-use beach area. The forest area surrounding Lake Hudson is commonly used for seasonal game hunting, including waterfowl, turkey, and deer hunting. The forest contains numerous trails, but motorized vehicles are not permitted off the main roads. In addition to camping, fishing, and hunting, other activities within the recreation area include picnicking, metal detecting, swimming, bird watching, hiking, photography, and geocaching. In 1993, Lake Hudson was designated as the first dark-sky preserve in the United States. It is currently one of seven such preserves in the state of Michigan, along with Negwegon State Park, Port Crescent State Park, Rockport State Recreation Area, Thompson's Harbor State Park, Wilderness State Park, and the internationally recognized Headlands Dark Sky Park. As required by the designation, the park must utilize measures to reduce light pollution, such as dimming headlights and outdoor lighting. Sizable communities near Lake Hudson include the village of Clayton about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) north, the city of Hudson eight miles (12.9 km) northwest, and the city of Morenci nine miles (14.5 km) south. Nearby state parks within 30 miles (48 km) include Hayes State Park, Cambridge Junction Historic State Park, and Watkins Lake State Park and County Preserve, as well as Harrison Lake State Park south in Ohio.

The Diamond Historic District encompasses 590 contributing resources. Wave Street Atlantic Street Ocean AvenueAlthough the Washington Square section of the Diamond Historic District--which is arrayed along Broad Street--was first settled by Europeans in the 1630s, the oldest surviving structure in the Diamond District is the c. 1825 Daniel Newhall House. Most of the District's earliest surviving houses are conservative, 2.5-story, center-chimney Federal buildings, but several Greek Revival structures also are extant. The Diamond District was substantially developed after 1840, when the area became a fashionable coastal summer resort. Accordingly, mid- and late-19th century architectural styles dominate. The style best represented is Colonial Revival, with numerous exemplars built between 1890 and 1940--notably the Charles Lovejoy House, which was added to the National Register in 1978. A significant number of Italianate, Queen Anne, and Second Empire houses also are present, including the Lucian Newhall House, which was added to the National Register in 1985. The American Shingle Style also is well represented. Although predominantly residential, the Diamond District includes a handful of commercial buildings, which are located on Broad and Lewis Streets,. The District also includes four religious structures, the oldest being a Quaker meetinghouse, built c. 1825.

Taxonomy The Inca jay was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1775 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Corvus yncas in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. Buffon's specimen came from Peru; in 1953 the American ornithologist John Todd Zimmer restricted the type location to Chilpes, Department of Jun√≠n. The Inca jay is now one of 17 species placed in the genus Cyanocorax that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826. The name of the genus is from Ancient Greek kuanos \\"dark-blue\\" and korakos \\"raven\\". The specific epithet yncas is from Incas, the inhabitants of Peru in pre-Columbian America. Five subspecies are recognised: * C. y. galeatus (Ridgway, 1900) ‚Äì west central Colombia * C. y. cyanodorsalis Dubois, AJC, 1874 ‚Äì central and east Colombia, northwest Venezuela * C. y. guatimalensis (Bonaparte, 1850) ‚Äì north Venezuela * C. y. yncas (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì southwest Colombia, east Ecuador, Peru to central Bolivia * C. y. longirostris (Carriker, 1933) ‚Äì Mara√±on Valley (north Peru) Some ornithologists treat the green jay of North America and the Inca jay as conspecific and with C. yncas luxuosus as the green jay and C. yncas yncas as the Inca jay. Description The Inca jay is in length. The crown can appear mostly white, with blue limited to the frontal crest and nape. A black bib forms a broad band up to the sides of the head as well as a stripe through the eye line and one above it. The breast and underparts typically are bright yellow. The upper parts are rich green. The color of the iris is bright yellow. Voice As with most of the typical jays, this species has a very extensive voice repertoire. The bird's most common call makes a ' sound, but many other unusual notes also occur. One of the most distinctive calls sounds like an alarm bell. Distribution and habitat The range extends southwards in the Andes from the Colombia and Venezuela through Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Behaviour and ecology=Breeding Inca jays usually build a nest in a tree or in a thorny bush or thicket, and the female lays three to five eggs. Only the female incubates, but both parents take care of the young. In Colombia, Inca jays are recorded as retaining offspring for several years, and those young help the parents raise more chicks.Green Jay, Life History, All About Birds ‚Äì Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Allaboutbirds.org. Retrieved on 2013-03-30. In Venezuela, they have been observed being victims of nest parasitism by giant cowbirds.

The well-preserved building with its massive original hardwood frame has many surviving early components including a rare original enclosed stairway, doors, wooden latches, hardware, cupboards, brick nogging in the walls, and early paint. The house was the original home of the Georgetown Historical Society. The Society moved to the Brocklebank-Nelson-Beecher House in 1975 and sold the Dickinson-Pillsbury-Witham House to an archaeologist, who took meticulous care of the property for over 40 years. During that time the building was the subject of a survey by architectural historian and genealogist Abbott Lowell Cummings. The oldest part of the 2.5 story wood frame colonial house was built circa 1692-1700 by James Dickinson, and consisted of the chimney and rooms to its right. The left side rooms are also First Period, apparently built soon afterward, based on similar construction methods used on the two sections. In 1856 a knee-wall cape was moved to the lot and attached as an ell on the right-hand side against the oldest end of the dwelling. In addition to historical integrity, the house is notable for being the home of War of 1812 veteran and inventor Paul Pillsbury, who purchased the property about 1801. His inventions included devices for pegging shoes, milling bark off tree sections, and stripping kernels from ears of corn. Paul Pillsbury and his wife Elisabeth Frink had a family of seven sons and one daughter. Elisabeth died in 1829 at age 41. Pillsbury remarried in 1843 to Sarah Andrews Pike, the widow of Benjamin Pike and mother of CSA Brigadier-General Albert Pike.

In part this was attributable to the Western Sahara War in which Mauritania was briefly engaged, but the driving distance from Europe was also a factor when compared to Algeria whose profile similarly benefitted from the rise of the original Paris-Dakar rally in the early 1980s. Around the same time in France, a TV show by desert doyen Th√©odore Monod (who'd travelled widely in Mauritania with camels from the 1930), also helped raise the country's profile. It was the 1991 ceasefire with the Polisario Front along with the escalating Algerian Civil War of the 1990s which saw the so-called Atlantic Route open up to trade and tourism, when Algeria and its trans-Saharan routes closed. Initially Moroccan army convoys loosely escorted travellers, which included a healthy trade in used carshttps://sahara-overland.com/2013/09/05/desert- dealers-mauritania-1997/ from Dakhla, Western Sahara to the Moroccan border with Mauritania. Once in Mauritania one drove across the sands to Nouadhibou where local guides were needed to travel the desert and beach piste to the capital, Nouakchott. In 1999 Trailblazer Guides published the original, 650-page edition of Sahara Overlandhttps://trailblazer-guides.com/book/sahara- overland/ which included several routes in Mauritania. Similar route guides were available in French and German, with many more books in French describing the geography of the country. Some intrepid travellers hitched a ride (or loaded their cars) eastwards on the Mauritania Railway which brought iron ore to Nouadhibou from the mines inland at Zouerat. From Choum this provided access to Atar, at the foot of the Adrar plateau, scenically and culturally the gateway to Mauritania‚Äôs touristic heartland. Around the turn of the millennium the completion of a new inland road linking Nouadhibou with Nouakchott (the first sealed road to cross the Sahara from north to south)https://sahara-overland.com/routes/, as well as the advent of inexpensive charter flights from France directly to Atar by Point- Afriquehttps://point-afrique.fr/qui-sommes-nous/une-aventure-historique/, helped inexpensive fly-in tourism gain a foothold in Mauritania. A shocking set back, especially among French visitors, was the murder of the Tollet familyhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2008/01/2008525142216351304.html and their guide near Aleg on Christmas Eve, 2007 which led to the cancellation of the Dakar Rally (and its eventual relocation to South America). Then in November and December 2009 two kidnappingshttps://sahara- overland.com/kidnappings/ set things still further. In fact tourist traffic from Moroccan Western Sahara never stopped, despite over-cautious travel advice issued by the European government foreign ministries. In 2018, the improvement of the security situation saw the resumption of the renamed Le Point Voyages charter flights to Atar. Featured on French television,https://www.francetvinfo.fr/economie/emploi/metiers/restauration- hotellerie-sports-loisirs/mauritanie-le-retour-des-touristes_2682378.html it was hoped to kickstart a revival of desert tourism in Mauritania‚Äôs Adrar region, although the current climate in the Sahara makes it unlikely tourism will quickly return to their brief heyday. The Mauritanian army make sure the largely desolate far north and east of the country remain off limits to regular tourists. As it is these places were virtually never visited by tourists, except by some trans-Saharan expeditionshttps://sahara- overland.com/2017/02/14/sahara-west-to-east-crossings/ in less volatile times. Along with some on the ancient settlements listed below, other tourist highlights in the Mauritanian Sahara include the Richat Structure just beyond Ouadane, Fort Saganne, the nearby Amojjar Pass and the sandy Tifoujar Pass; Terjit oasis and the medieval ruins of Ksar el Barka. * In 2010's, Mauritania visited by 1,500 tourists each year. This number is extremely low relative to size of local population. In late May 2019 total local population of Mauritania stood at 4,077,000 inhabitants. This give a ratio of 1 tourist for every 2,718 locals. Ancient cities The old cities of Ouadane, Chinguetti, Oualata, Tichitt, Ksar el Barka, Aoudaghost and Koumbi Saleh are all vestiges of a rich past during the apogee of the trans-Saharan trade from Black Africa. Many of these cities developed into religious and cultural centres of learning. The expansion of Europeans maritime trading saw to the decline these once great cities. Chinguetti right Chinguetti is 86 km from Atar, 90 km and 128 km from Ouadane, along the plateau track. Regarded as the 7th Holy City of Islam, Chinguetti was a religious centre and famous for its many Koranic schools and universities. The city also played a significant commercial role during the camel trading era. The influence of Chinguetti largely exceeded the borders of current Mauritania, with scholars renowned as far as the Orient. Mauritania was once known as the \\"Bilad Chenguetti\\" ‚Äì the Land of Chinguetti which reached its apogee during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the 1980s the town was shot up during an attack by Polisario guerrillas which contributed ld to Mauritania withdrawing from that conflict. Today the older south side of the town is partly ruined or buried under dunes, but it still offers an impressive spectacle to the visitor. Some old buildings, including the 13th-century mosque with its rectangular minaret still survive in the old city, The libraries or 'document repositories' of Chinguetti contain hundreds of invaluable and well preserved medieval manuscripts, detailing commercial transactions, aspects of Koranic law and scientific observations. Ouadane Ouadane is 128 km from Chinguetti and 180 km from Atar. right Ouadane, or the city of the \\" two oueds\\" is an ancient settlement whose foundation dates back to 1140. In the following centuries it flourished caravan city on the Trans-Saharan trade from Timbuktu when it was the most significant city of the Mauritanian Sahara, renowned for its palm groves, mosques and libraries. In the 17th century the city was visited by the Portuguese who established trade links and at which time Ouadane reached its apogee. Its decline started when European mariners saw to the diversion of sub-Saharan trade from the end of the 17th century. UNESCO classifies the city as part of the World Inheritance to humanity. Perched on an escarpment covered in ruined stone buildings, Ouadane evokes the past glories of the Sahara. Recommended places to visit: the old mosque, the palm plantation, the old city and the Richat Structure as well as the meteorite studied by Theodore Monod, El Beyedh, the mysterious Armakou Pass and the fort of El Ghallaouya. Oualata Oualata is 90 km north of N√©ma, an old city and is famous for its bas relief mural decorations. Paintings with various motifs decorate the houses. Oualata was an active city during the Middle Ages. It was built on the site of Birou in the 11th century. It was a caravan city on the trade route from Timbuktu. Tichit Tichit is an isolated but historic town, 230 km east of Tidjikja and 490 km from Nema along the sandy Dhar Tichit piste. Tichit's history dates back to the 12th century when it was a commercial metropolis on the Saharan trade. The city was also famous for its libraries and for its 700-year-old mosque. Venetian glass beads have been found here, traded during the medieval era.  References  External links  Mauritania ","title":"Tourism in Mauritania"},{"id":"18745799","text":"The E. P.

Built without mortar between the stones, parts of it date back to 1735. It was used to handle traffic between Methuen and Salem, New Hampshire. History The location, along the old Dracut Path, was a marshy area of the Spicket River that could be forded by horse or cart. The ford eventually was bridged. The earliest town record, from the Town meeting of 1730, show a simple plank bridge was used which required regular maintenance at the cost of the township. The wooden bridge was replaced with the more durable stone arch bridge in 1835. Solid abutment supports were constructed on each river bank. A wooden frame shaped like the underside of the bridge, was constructed over the river. The stones where then set on the frame, without mortar. The bridge was filled in with rubble and dirt, which over time would compress against the abutments. The wooden frame was then removed. If constructed correctly a stone arch bridge should last indefinitely, but the Sands Bridge is not a well built bridge. Photographic evidence shows the keystone had slipped by the late nineteenth century. The bridge was used consistently until it was taken out of service in 1963 when the Spicket River was rerouted and Interstate 93 was built. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places June 20, 1984. Current status In May 2009, the bridge was in a terrible state of disrepair and in danger of collapse. However, Methuen city officials wanted to make the area more accessible to the public and have unveiled plans to restore the bridge and build an adjoining park with walking paths, viewing areas, \\"rustic seating\\" and a parking lot. As of Sept. 2012, the city of Methuen has allowed the bridge to fall further into disrepair. City officials have not taken any action to care for the bridge.

It is seen as a counter- project to the plan to build the Visaginas nuclear power plant in Lithuania and is considered not only as an energy, but also as a geopolitical project. In June 2013 the construction was temporarily stopped for the project to be redesigned. Motivation The nuclear power plant is foreseen to secure power supply for the Kaliningrad Oblast and to replace natural gas-based power generation. It has been mentioned that the Kaliningrad Oblast needs the project \\"because for the time being it imports energy from NATO countries.\\" The excess electricity was planned to be exported into the EU market. According to Sergey Boyarkin, deputy general director of Rosenergoatom, the first reactor would be sufficient for Kaliningrad Oblast's needs, while electricity produced by the second reactor would be exported when not filling gaps in generation caused by refuelling and downtime. Lithuania, Poland and Germany were named as potential export markets. Sergey Boyarkin has said that the shutdown of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant combined with Polish plans to scrap coal-fired generation in compliance with environmental regulation means that the Baltic region faces an energy crisis by 2015. He also has said that Kaliningrad Oblast will be isolated from electricity supplies from Russia if the Baltic states de-synchronize themselves from the Russian electricity grid and join the synchronous grid of Continental Europe (ENTSO-E grid). He also mentioned technical complications and unreliability in electricity transfer from Smolensk Nuclear Power Plant, the main supplier of Kaliningrad Oblast, via Belarus and Lithuania. On the other hand, the project has been seen as a counter-project to the Visaginas nuclear power plant project in Lithuania. Russia invited Lithuania to participate in the project, instead of building the nuclear power plant in Lithuania. History A framework construction agreement was signed between the head of Rosatom Sergei Kiriyenko and Governor of Kaliningrad Oblast Georgy Boos on 16 April 2008. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed the order for construction of the 2,300 MW plant in September 2009. Ground preparation works started on 25 February 2010. The first concrete was scheduled to be laid in April 2011, but was delayed until February 2012. On 4 June 2013, an order of Atomenergoproject, dated 30 May 2013 and published on 4 June 2013, ordered a series of staffing and budgeting overhauls \\"in connection with the mothballing of the Baltic NPP and NIAEP budget adjustments for 2013.\\" It was later said that the project will be temporary stopped to reconsider the project's design in case there will be no export to the European Union. On 4 July 2013, Sergey Kiriyenko, head of Rosatom, announced that both units will be built like previously planned, with two VVER-1200 and no smaller reactor. Technical features The original design had foreseen two VVER-1200/491 pressurized water reactors in an AES-2006 standard design configuration. The reactors have a capacity of 1150 MWe each and would be supplied by Atomstroyexport. The first reactor was planned to be operational by 2017 and the second reactor by 2018. Cost was expected to be around ‚Ç¨6.8 billion (US$8.8 billion) Two further reactors could be added in the future depending on economic development in Kaliningrad and in the Baltic region in general. The redesigned plan may consist of two reactors by capacity of 640 MW (VVER-640) and 40 MW (KLT-40S). An alternative foresees up to eight reactors by capacity of 40 MW each. Project development The project is developed by Rosatom's subsidiary Inter RAO UES. According to Rosatom, 49% of shares in the project will be offered to European companies. This would be the first Russian nuclear power plant with foreign participation. Potential investors named in this context are ƒåEZ, Enel, and Iberdrola. However, as of June 2013, no foreign partner has joined the project.

The most common tuning is the pentatonic scale without semitones, for example do re mi sol la, which varies by region. The music played on the sanza is polyrhythmic with overlapping rhythms. The instrument is often used to accompany the voice, to great effect. The keys are attached to a sounding board by metal strips or wires and placed over a gourd or clay resonator of varying sizes. The number of keys varies by region, as well. Within each region the instrument can take on a variety of shapes. The sanza in the accompanying photo has a resonator made from a turtle shell that has been attached to the sounding board with natural fibers.

Playing career=Naxxar Lions Orosco Anonam was born in Nigeria, but moved to Malta at an early age and began his playing career with Naxxar Lions of the Maltese Premier League. His first season with the club was the 1998‚Äì99 season. He found himself a regular in the team and 21 appearances, and scored seven goals in his debut season, as Naxxar Lions recorded a 6th-place finish in the Maltese Premier League. Anonam continued to impress at Naxxar Lions, and went into the 1999‚Äì00 season hoping to help the club maintain a respectable league position. He helped Naxxar Lions finish in 7th position in the Maltese Premier League that season, making 19 appearances, and scoring a very impressive 13 goals. Sliema Wanderers Following a string on impressive performances for Naxxar Lions, Orosco left the club and joined fellow Maltese Premier League outfit Sliema Wanderers for the 2000‚Äì01 season. In his first season with Sliema Wanderers, Anonam made 26 appearances and scored 22 goals, helping his new club to a place finish in the Maltese Premier League. For the 2001‚Äì02 season, Orosco was loaned out to Hungarian outfit Vasas SC. The stint was only a brief one, with Anonam making just two appearances, but failed to score. He returned to Sliema Wanderers for the remainder of the 2000‚Äì01 season, he went on to make 24 appearances and scored seven goals, helping Sliema Wanderers to a 2nd-place finish in the Maltese Premier League. Anonam went into the 2002‚Äì03 season, making another loan move overseas, this time joining Cypriot side APOEL, the stint lasted longer than the previous one. Orosco again returned to Sliema Wanderers for the remainder of the 2002‚Äì03 season, he went on to make 15 appearances and scored six goals, helping Sliema Wanderers to a 3rd-place finish in the Maltese Premier League. Orosco went into the 2003‚Äì04 season hoping to win some silverware with Sliema Wanderers, Anonam achieved this as the club recorded a 1st-place finish in the Maltese Premier League. Over the course of the season Orosco made 24 appearances and scored six goals. For the 2004‚Äì05 season, Orosco and Sliema Wanderers continued to emulate the successes of previous season. Anonam made 21 appearances and scored four goals, as Sliema Wanderers completed the domestic double, finishing in 1st position in the Maltese Premier League and winning the U*Bet FA Trophy. Anonam and Sliema Wanderers went into the 2005‚Äì06 looking to add to their previous successes, however Anonam did not have a great deal of impact on the season as the club failed to retain the Maltese Premier League title, which Birkirkara went on to win by two points, with Sliema Wanderers recording a 2nd-place finish, Orosco made 11 appearances, but failed to score during the season. Orosco went on to the 2006‚Äì07 hoping to win more trophies, however Sliema Wanderers recorded another 2nd-place finish, but were beaten comprehensively by Marsaxlokk, who won the title by 11 points. Anonam made 19 appearances and scored two goals. The 2007‚Äì08 season turned out to be Orosco's last season with Sliema Wanderers. The club had a disappointing season by their own high standards, finishing in 4th position in the Maltese Premier League. Orosco notched up 23 appearances and scored three goals, throughout the season. Floriana Orosco Anonam joined Maltese Premier League rivals Floriana from Sliema Wanderers just before the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Floriana hoped that signing Anonam would boost the club's attacking line up, although he primarily took up a role of playing just the front man. Orosco added experience and talent to a relatively young side and showed great versatility that would pay dividends to him and the team throughout season. In his debut season with Floriana, Orosco made 25 appearances and scored 7 goals, as Floriana recorded a place finish in the Maltese Premier League. The 2009‚Äì10 season began with the appointment of Irish manager Roddy Collins as the new manager of Floriana. He found himself using Orosco as a central defender, mainly due to injuries and a shortage in experienced players to play the position. Anonam's excellent versatility continued to show. On the opening day of the season, Orosco scored a fantastic goal, when he hit a cracking drive from the edge of the box against Qormi, capping off an impressive first competitive outing in defence. In October 2009, assistant manager Tony Alamango left the club. Orosco was appointed as the club's new assistant manager, as well as still continuing in a playing capacity. Manager, Roddy Collins left the club in January 2010, with Anonam been given the role of the club's caretaker manager, until Serbian Zoran Popovic was re-appointed as the club's manager. Orosco returned to his role of player-assistant manager. The 2009‚Äì10 season proved to be another difficult one for Floriana, with the club slipping into the relegation pool, but Orosco helped the club finish safely in 7th position. Over the season, Anonam played 21 games and scored two goals. Tarxien Rainbows On 24 July 2010, Orosco Anonam left Floriana and joined fellow Maltese Premier League team Tarxien Rainbows, signing a two-year deal with the club.

Early career Milburn started a career as a journalist, but then worked freelance for a number of charities including CAFOD. She also worked as a researcher on a number of BBC television appeals, including Challenge Anneka from Malawi, Going Live and Blue Peter specials from Jamaica. In 1993 she became the Chief Executive of the Association of Spinal Injury Research Rehabilitation and Reintegration (ASPIRE) charity for seven years, where she ensured that the Aspire National Training Centre was completed on time and on budget. In July 2000 she became the Chief executive of the BBC Children in Need Appeal. Prince's Trust In May 2004 Milburn became Chief executive of The Prince's Trust, succeeding Sir Tom Shebbeare who had been at the Prince's Trust for 16 years. Milburn was appointed Group Chief Executive (covering the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States and International) in 2017. Milburn regularly speaks publicly about the Prince's Trust's work with young people and in August 2008, spoke of how research suggested that young people are creating their own \\"youth communities\\" and gangs. At the same time the Prince's Trust was running a campaign, Change the Record, to counter the negative images that the media give about young people. Milburn has also explained how The Prince's Trust's Team programme is part of a joined up package of support which helps three in four young people to achieve positive outcomes. She said about The Prince's Trust Team program in 2008 that \\"Our great worry was that, on The Prince's Trust Team programme, you took them through the 12 weeks, you built up their expectation and [then] they fell off the cliff face. When Milburn joined the Prince's Trust in 2004, the charity was helping 41,680 young people a year, and by 2007‚Äì08 41,324. During Milburn's time as chief executive the charity has increasingly directed its help to young people who are long term unemployed, and the charity has increasingly measured its success as an organisation by how many young people they have got off the unemployment register, by getting them into some employment, training or education. This figure has risen over four years from 76% to 79%. Milburn regularly attends high-profile royal events as the representative of the Prince's Trust.  Media Trust  Milburn has been a trustee of Media Trust, the UK's leading communications charity, since October 2009. Personal life Milburn is the eldest of five sisters. She has been married twice, and her current husband Keith works for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Honours In the 2012 New Year Honours, Milburn was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to charity. In the 2017 New Year Honours, she was appointed Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (DCVO) in recognition of her service as chief executive officerExecutiveof The Prince's Trust Group.

Along with the stories there appeared a page intended to start a V-Man fan club amongst the readers, called the V-Boys and V-Girls. The series only lasted two issues (January and March, 1942). V-Man then made appearances in seven issues of Fox's Blue Beetle comic, starting with issue #13. In 2008, V-Man, along with many other characters who‚Äôd fallen into the public domain, was included in Dynamite Entertainment‚Äôs Project Superpowers; after decades of being trapped in the Urn of Pandora, he was now transformed in such a way that anyone who comes near him becomes fatally ill, and he has to be constantly quarantined as a result. According to writer Jim Krueger, he now represents ‚Äúthat person who gets out of prison but can‚Äôt live a free life.‚ÄùWizardUniverse.com: The Power Players of Project Superpowers Fictional biography During World War II, American Jerry Steele freed the inmates of a German prisoner-of-war camp, but was himself captured and apparently executed; however, a peasant was able to revive him with an herbal remedy and smuggle him to a safe haven. There, a man named Father Duroc asked Steele to take an oath called the V-Pledge, after which Steele was suddenly possessed of greater physical and mental fitness and courage, and garbed in a patriotic costume. As V-Man, he fought enemy soldiers in Europe and England. His principal gimmick was a ring which picks up radio, TV and \\"spot-focusing\\" rays. He was aided by a group of teenagers called the V-Boys, who each wore a sweater with a large V on the front. The V-Boys were aware of V-Man's secret identity and communicated with him using the aforementioned ring. Project Superpowers After the war, V-Man was one of many heroes who were trapped and imprisoned in the Urn of Pandora by the misguided Fighting Yank. Decades later, the Urn was broken and the heroes were freed, some having new superpowers as a result of their imprisonment; V-Man, however, was now a ‚Äúwalking, talking plague,‚Äù causing anyone who comes close to him to become fatally ill.

International achievements In 1932 Heron achieved international success by beating Doug Tomalin to win the British Diving Championship at Leeds.Irish Independent, 2 Aug. 1932 In preparation for the 1936 Summer Olympics, Heron spent the first six months of the year in Miami, Florida, where he trained with Pete Desjardins, the 1928 Olympic champion.Irish Independent, 25 Jun. 1936 However, due to a dispute as to which sporting body should represent Irish athletes, Ireland did not participate in the 1936 Olympics.Patrick O'Sullivan, \\"Ireland & the Olympic Games\\", History Ireland, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Spring, 1998), pp. 40-45 The next games took place in London in 1948 but another dispute over jurisdiction led to Heron and his team mates withdrawing from all swimming and diving events. Heron did, however, compete in the opening heats of the diving competitions before the withdrawal. Later years Although Heron retired from competitive diving in 1950, he was persuaded to take part in the 1968 Irish three-metre springboard championship held at Blackrock Baths in Dublin. At the age of fifty-seven, he took the title by defeating the reigning champion, George Matulevicze.Irish Times, 24 Aug. 1968 He continued to take part in diving exhibitions and competitions well into his sixties.Irish Times, 6 Aug. 1976 At the annual Texaco Sports Star Awards held in January 1977, Heron received the Hall of Fame award from Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave.Irish Press, 1 Feb. 1977 Personal life Heron was married to Helen (‚ÄòNellie‚Äô) McGuirk; they had no children.

He was a cousin of Sayf al-Dawla and a member of the Hamdanid dynasty, who were rulers in northern Syria and Upper Mesopotamia during the 10th century. He served Sayf al-Dawla as governor of Manbij as well as court poet, and was active in his cousin's wars against the Byzantine Empire. He was captured by the Byzantines in 959/962 and spent several years at their capital, Constantinople, where he composed his most famous work, the collection of poems titled al-R≈´miyyƒÅt (ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸàŸÖŸäÿßÿ™). He was ransomed in 966, and was killed in 968, when he raised a revolt against his nephew Sa'd al-Dawla, Sayf al-Dawla's successor. He is considered among the greatest figures of classical Arabic poetry. Life Family tree of the Hamdanids He was born in 932 or in 933, probably in Iraq and specifically in Baghdad, as his father Abi'l-Ala Sa'id‚Äîa son of the Hamdanid family's founder, Hamdan ibn Hamdun‚Äîoccupied a distinguished position in the court of the Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadir (reigned 908‚Äì932). Abu Firas' mother was a Byzantine Greek slave concubine (an umm walad, freed after giving birth to her master's child). His maternal descent later was a source of scorn and taunts from his Hamdanid relatives, a fact reflected in his poems. His father was killed in 935, during a dispute over possession of Mosul with his nephew, Nasir al-Dawla, and Abu Firas' mother fled to the protection of Nasir al-Dawla's brother, Sayf al-Dawla, and when the latter occupied Aleppo and northern Syria in 944/5, Abu Firas was welcomed at his cousin's court. There he was raised under the supervision of Sayf al- Dawla, who also married his sister. Aside from being a renowned warrior, Sayf al-Dawla was famous for his patronage of scholars and poets, and the young Abu Firas grew up in a culturally vibrant atmosphere, which saw assembled at Aleppo some of the finest minds of the Muslim world: the preacher Ibn Nubatah, the philosopher and musician al-Farabi, and the great poet al-Mutanabbi, while the grammarian Ibn Khalawayh was his tutor. Map of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine frontier zone, where Abu Firas was active Abu Firas soon distinguished himself both for his martial as well as for his literary ability, and in 947/8, when he was only 16, Sayf al-Dawla appointed him governor of Manbij, close to the border with the Byzantine Empire, to which the governorship of Harran was later added. Despite his youth, he distinguished himself both in the conflicts with the Nizari tribes of the Diyar Mudar and the Syrian Desert, as well as in his cousin's frequent raiding campaigns into Byzantine territory. Thus, in 952, he defeated the Byzantines under Bardas Phokas the Younger or his son Constantine Phokas, when the latter tried to interfere with Sayf al-Dawla's refortification of the towns of Ra'ban and Mar'ash in the frontier zone. His captivity by the Byzantines is variously dated by the Arabic sources. According to Ibn Khallikan, he was first captured by the Byzantines in 959, but escaped captivity at the fortress of Kharshana by jumping into the Euphrates; this tale is however dismissed by some modern commentators. Most sources place his capture in 962 (in November, according to Ibn al-Athir). The Byzantine general Theodore Parsakoutenos led a raid of 1,000 or 1,300 men in the vicinity of Manbij, and when Abu Firas set out with only seventy men to obstruct their plundering, he was captured. Ibn Shaddad reports the story with slight differences, but states that the event took place in 959/960. Parsakoutenos tried to have his high-ranking prisoner exchanged with his own brother and father, who had become prisoners of Sayf al-Dawla at Hadath in 954. Despite sending repeated letters to his cousin pleading for his release, Abu Firas spent several years as a captive at the Byzantine capital Constantinople, as Sayf al-Dawla did not consider it proper to ransom him while leaving thousands of other captives to languish in captivity. Abu Firas was eventually released as part of a general prisoner exchange at Samosata in 966. During his captivity, Abu Firas wrote some of his finest poetry, the collection known as al-R≈´miyyƒÅt (R≈´m was the Arab name for the Byzantines). In the meantime, Abu Firas' mother had died, her passing a source of lamentation in Abu Firas' poetry. After his release, Abu Firas was restored to his position and was named governor of Homs, but the situation was rapidly changing: less than a year after his release, Sayf al-Dawla died, and the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo began to crumble. Abu Firas quickly quarreled with Sayf al-Dawla's 15-year-old heir, Abu'l-Ma'ali, the son of Abu Firas' own sister, Sakhinah. Overestimating the support he enjoyed among the Arab tribes, Abu Firas revolted against his nephew, but was defeated and killed on 4 April 968 by Abu'l-Ma'ali's general Karghawayh. At the news of his death, Sakhinah was reportedly so overcome with grief, that she plucked out one of her own eyes. Work and legacy Abu Firas enjoys a prominent position among the greats of classical Arabic poetry. His near-contemporary, the eminent scholar and statesman Sahib ibn Abbad, summed up the esteem in which Abu Firas was held already in the 10th century in a phrase that was frequently quoted by later authorities: \\"Poetry began with a king (i.e. Imru al-Qays) and ended with a king (i.e. Abu Firas)\\". The corpus of his works was edited after his death by Ibn Khalawayh, who also attached a commentary, largely written by Abu Firas himself. Nevertheless, in later times several manuscript versions of his works with significant variations between them were extant, which indicates that Ibn Khalawayh's edition was not the only one. Abu Firas' early work comprises poems in the classical qa·π£ƒ´da form in praise of the Hamdanids and their deeds‚Äîthe 225-line ·∏§amdƒÅniyyah is perhaps the most notable‚Äîand shorter poems in the  øIrƒÅqƒ´ form on courtly themes of love, wine, hunting and friendship. He also produced several pro-Shia poems attacking the Abbasids. Although his early works and the al-R≈´miyyƒÅt inevitably show al-Mutanabbi's influence, Abu Firas was the great poet's rival, encouraged by his tutor Ibn Khalawayh, a bitter opponent of al-Mutanabbi. According to H.A.R. Gibb, the qa·π£ƒ´da poems \\"are remarkable for their sincerity, directness, and natural vigour\\", in contrast to the elaborate style of al-Mutanabbi, while the  øIrƒÅqƒ´ poems are merely \\"elegant trifles, formal and unoriginal\\". It is the al- R≈´miyyƒÅt, however, and their \\"combination [...] of pathos, dignity, and pride\\" (El Tayib) that have secured Abu Firas' place among the greats of Arabic poetry. In addition, according to H.A.R. Gibb, his personal traits helped spread his reputation: from his noble descent and fair appearance, his bravery and generosity, to his tendency to egotism and over-reaching ambition, \\"he lived up to the Arab ideal of chivalry which he expressed in his poetry\\".

These include Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). Nef localizes primarily to the cytoplasm but also partially to the Plasma membrane (PM) and is one of many pathogen-expressed proteins, known as virulence factors, which function to manipulate the host's cellular machinery and thus allow infection, survival or replication of the pathogen. Nef stands for \\"Negative Factor\\" and although it is often considered dispensable for HIV-1 replication, in infected hosts the viral protein markedly elevates viral titers.  Function  The expression of Nef early in the viral life cycle ensures T-cell activation and the establishment of a persistent state of infection, two basic attributes of HIV infection. Viral expression of Nef induces numerous changes within the infected cell including the modulation of protein cell surface expression, cytoskeletal remodeling, and signal transduction. Since the activation state of the infected cell plays an important role in the success rate of HIV-1 infection, it is important that resting T-cells be primed to respond to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimuli. HIV-1 Nef lowers the threshold for activation of CD4+ lymphocytes, but is not sufficient to cause activation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. By down regulating cell surface expression of CD4 and Lck, Nef creates a narrow TCR response which likely optimizes HIV-1 viral production and generates a susceptible population of cells to further infect. Nef retargets kinase-active Lck away from the plasma membrane to early and recycling endosomes (RE) as well as the Trans-Golgi network (TGN). RE/TGN associated Lck sub-populations in Nef expressing cells are in the catalytically active conformation and thus signaling competent. While TCR signaling takes place at the plasma membrane (PM), activation of the Ras- GTPase takes place in intracellular compartments including the Golgi apparatus. Nef induced enrichment of active Lck in these compartments results in an increase of localized RAS activity and enhanced activation of Erk kinase and the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2). Since IL-2 is known to activate the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of T-cells to become effector T-cells; this is a self-serving effect that creates a new population of cells which HIV-1 is able to infect. Self-activation of the infected cell by IL-2 also stimulates the cell to become an effector cell and initiate the machinery which HIV-1 relies upon for its own proliferation. To further evade the host immune response, Nef down-regulates the cell surface and total expression of the negative immune modulator CTLA-4 by targeting the protein for lysosomal degradation. In contrast to CD28 which activates T-cells, CTLA-4 is essentially an ‚Äúoff-switch‚Äù which would inhibit the viral production if it were activated. Lentiviruses such as HIV-1 have acquired proteins such as Nef which perform a wide array of functions including the identification of CTLA-4 before it reaches the PM and tagging it for degradation. Nef is also known to phosphorylate and inactivate Bad, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family thus protecting the infected cells from apoptosis. Cytoskeletal remodeling is thought to reduce TCR signaling during early infection and is also modulated to some degree by Nef. Actin remodeling is generally modulated by the actin severing factor cofilin. Nef is able to associate with the cellular kinase PAK2 which phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin and interferes with early TCR signaling.  Clinical significance  The Sydney blood bank cohort (SBBC) were a group of eight patients who were asymptomatic many years after initial infection by transfusion from an infected blood donor. Later analyses showed that the virus strain was a Nef-deleted variant.  Vaccine  A Nef-deleted virus vaccine has not been tried in humans although it was successfully tested in Rhesus macaques.

He had five siblings, four of whom selected lives in religion as well. After receiving a public education in Beacon Hill from 1919 to 1923, Power attended St. Mary Parochial School from 1923 to 1927, whence he entered O'Dea High School before leaving a year later for St. Joseph College in Mountain View, California. He studied at St. Patrick Seminary in Menlo Park from 1933 to 1935, and St. Edward Seminary in Kenmore from 1935 to 1939. While at St. Edward, Power was a classmate of Joseph McKeirnan of Pomeroy, Washington. Power was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Gerald Shaughnessy, S.M., on June 3, 1939, and then served as assistant pastor at St. James Cathedral until 1940. He was subsequently sent to study canon law at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. from 1940 to 1943. Upon his return to Washington, he was chaplain of Holy Names Academy (1943-1952) and of St. James Cathedral (1952-1955).

It was first published in 1924, so it is restricted by copyright. However, brief parts of it are quoted here as fair use, and the whole poem is available elsewhere on the Internet. Overview The poem comprises five sections, each of six tercets, describing the same seascape as viewed from the deck of a ship. Each section repeats the description in different terms but uses recurring words (slopping, chocolate, umbrellas, green, blooms, etc.) and often the same syntax. In each section the last line of the fourth tercet is written in French. Rhymes are used in somewhat changing patterns, but the final line of each section always rhymes with the final line of the preceding tercet. Essentially the poem is structured as a set of variations on a theme. Section III, quoted here, figures in Joan Richardson's reading of \\"Sea Surface\\" as having Stevens's sexuality as its \\"true subject\\". The prelude describes (\\"most hermetically\\") the period preceding sexual climax. The reference to a piano is explained by the fact that his mother and his wife, Elsie, played the piano. \\"For him, the piano and other keyboard instruments are always attached to something magical connected with the idea of beauty and the allure of the female, as, for example, in \\"Peter Quince at the Clavier,\\" Richardson writes, \\" Accordingly, the machine of ocean, his projection, is now \`tranced,' carried away by the rapture of the \`uncertain green... as a prelude holds and holds.\\"Richardson, p. 64 Richardson continues: > He imaginatively records both his sensations and those of his wife. The > female is felt by him as \\"silver petals of white blooms/ Unfolding in the > water,\\" and he, in his maleness, is \\"feeling sure/ of the milk within the > saltiest spurge.\\" He goes on to express the feelings of both of them > throughout this section and in part of the next. The climax itself is > described as, \\"The sea unfolding in the sunken clouds/ Oh! [marking the > surprise of the moment of climax] C'√©tais mon extase et mon amour.\\" Richardson explicitly invokes Stevens's distinction between the true subject of a poem and the poetry of the subject, in order to justify a reading that dwells on what she takes to be the true subject. She writes, > In closing, I offer the following observations taken from \\"The Irrational > Element in Poetry:\\" \\"One is always writing about two things at the same time > in poetry and it is this that produces the tension characteristic of poetry. > One is the true subject and the other is the poetry of the subject. The > difficulty of sticking to the true subject, when it is the poetry of the > subject that is paramount in one's mind, need only be mentioned to be > understood.\\" Buttel does not draw the distinction, but he implicitly focuses on the poetry of the subject, the \\"Poetry of sky and sea\\" in the concluding two stanzas, discussing not deep psychology but rather the syntactical and semantic features of Stevens's style. > The verse moves fluently from line to line, and the variations intensify the > exultation in the open-air vividness and splendor of the seascape and > skyscape....the combination of accents and alliteration in \\"clouds came > clustering,\\" with \\"came\\" in this context picking up a stress, heightens the > impressiveness and drama produced by the image of the \\"sovereign\\" cloud > masses \\"clustering\\" -- just the right word in meaning and sound -- into > transitory form. The metrical regularity of the following sentence, abetted > by the repetition of sound in \\"conch\\" and \\"conjuration,\\" contributes to the > majestic authority of the note sounded by Triton. The suspended moment of > turning is caught in the hovering emphasis on \\"green blooms turning,\\" even > though the long spondee adds an extra accent to the line; and this prepares > for the immense satisfactionn of \\"clearing opalescence\\" -- the jewel-like > iridescence dissolving into an instant of transfiguring clarity.

About \\"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\\", she writes, \\"in his witty moments, Stevens practices legerdemain with the world's \`reality' and produces a fantasia of shifting possibles, the brilliant changes of \`Sea Surface Full of Clouds'.\\"Vendler, p. 35 Significantly, this reference occurs in the midst of a long discussion of Stevens's use of grammatical particles like \\"if\\" and \\"as if\\" in order to achieve the effect of \\"something half-glimpsed, half-seen, and that is, finally, what Stevens achieves over and over: if he has a dogma, it is the dogma of the shadowy, the ephemeral, the barely perceived, the iridescent.\\" It can't be denied that each approach‚ÄîRichardson's true-subject reading and Buttel's poetry-of-the-subject interpretation‚Äîbrings with it some insight into the poem. One might venture that the two approaches are in principle individually necessary and jointly sufficient for full understanding. The ideal joint account would not necessarily sign off on every detail of any given individual account, and the two approaches might have different weight for different poems. For instance, relatively little weight might attach to the \\"true subject\\" of The Revolutionists stop for Orangeade because of its devotion to light-hearted word play. In a poem like this, the poetry of the subject seems to be most of the story.  Notes  References  * Buttel, Robert.

Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009  History  The old Ottoman Turkish name of the town was Kurtbunar (\\"well of the wolves\\"): the village was first mentioned in Ottoman tax registers of 1673, although the area has been inhabited continuously since antiquity by the Getae tribe of Thracians, then the Slavs and the Bulgars, and constituted a part of the Bulgarian Empire during most of the Middle Ages. In 1878, Kurtbunar became part of the newly liberated Principality of Bulgaria and it was promoted to a district centre of Silistra County on 26 July 1882. The village was part of Romania along with all of Southern Dobruja between 1913 and 1940, and the name was rendered as Curtbunar. It was also a district centre of Durostor County under Romanian rule. The modern Bulgarian name honours Tervel of Bulgaria, a successful 8th-century Bulgarian monarch. The former village was proclaimed a town in January 1960. Tervel has a museum opened in 1986.

It lies between Hylton Road and Chester Road (A183 road). History Due to the cholera epidemic of 1831 and the subsequent overcrowding of churchyards, it was decided to build new cemeteries in Sunderland after the passing of the Burial Act 1852 and 1853. The chosen for Bishopwearmouth Cemetery lay on the edge of the county and parliamentary boundary of Sunderland and was glebe land, owned by the Parish of Bishopwearmouth. The land was sold by the parish for ¬£275 (¬£17,839.73 in 2007) per acre and the cemetery cost ¬£2000 (¬£129,743.47 in 2007) to build. It opened in July 1856, on the same day as another new cemetery, Mere Knolls Cemetery, situated in Fulwell. All religious denominations were allotted separate areas and it soon became the town's main burial site. In 1891, the cemetery was extended further west and further extended in 1926. The whole site now covers . Jewish burials Sunderland once had a thriving Jewish population. In 1856, the only Jewish cemetery, at Ayres Quay in Bishopwearmouth, closed. A site at the new Bishopwearmouth Cemetery for Jewish burials was then dedicated in the north east corner of the cemetery (the first cemetery in County Durham to do so), adjacent to the Roman Catholic section. On the cemetery's expansion in 1926, another section was dedicated at the new western edge and on the cemetery's final expansion in 1926, the new north-west section was dedicated and a Jewish prayer house was built; this section is currently fenced-off from the other wards of the cemetery. War Graves In the First World War, part of Ward 3 (Section A) of the cemetery was set apart for burials of servicemen. This plot, at a central point on the path linking the cemetery's two entrances, was extended in the Second World War. In all, 237 Commonwealth service personnel (all but about 100 of whom were buried in the plot) from the First World War and 156 from the Second are buried in this cemetery. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission are also responsible for 31 non-World War service burials and one Dutch war grave. CWGC Cemetery Report.

In 1981, she became an investor in London's Embassy Club, where celebrities mixed with the aristocracy.  Life  She was born Edith Sybil Lambart on 11 June 1918, the daughter of Captain Hon. Lionel John Olive Lambart, son of the 9th Earl of Cavan, and Adelaide Douglas Randolph. In 1940 she married the film producer Ivan Foxwell, among whose movies was The Colditz Story (1955). After her uncle, Horace Lambart, inherited the earldom of Cavan, she was granted the rank of a daughter of an earl by Royal Warrant of Precedence in 1947. In her role as a producer's wife she began meeting many celebrities and showed the forcefulness of her personality when she locked the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas in a room for five days, forcing him to remain sober long enough to complete a film script that her husband was producing. She also used to lunch regularly with No√´l Coward when he was in London. She was one of the few members of London society who remained close friends with Margaret, Duchess of Argyll after the \\"headless man\\" scandal which, combined with the Profumo affair involving Christine Keeler, threatened to topple the Government of the day. In the 1970s she began running the Embassy Club in Mayfair, which was London's first modern New York City-style nightclub and which attracted many celebrities, including Marvin Gaye, who became a frequent guest at Lady Edith's estate at Sherston, Wiltshire. The Sherston house became notorious for its sex and drugs parties attended by a mixture of show business celebrities and members of the aristocracy. It was reported, in the April 2004 issue of GQ magazine, that Lady Foxwell and Marvin Gaye had an affair. The report quoted writer/composer Bernard J. Taylor as saying he was told by Foxwell that she and Gaye had discussed marriage before his death. Lady Edith divorced Ivan Foxwell in 1976, after the couple had two daughters, Zia and Atalanta.  The Embassy Club  Lady Edith Foxwell was an investor in a consortium that bought the club in 1981, which was headed by Stephen Hayter, the manager of the club under its previous owner. The Embassy had been revived spectacularly by Jeremy Norman, opening in 1978 at almost the same time as the dance film Saturday Night Fever premiered. The Club opened with a star-studded fashion show by Ossie Clark, where guests included Lady Diana Cooper and Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll. Norman employed Michael Fish, the men's fashion designer and society darling, as his \\"greeter\\". The club was an instant success and its heyday lasted for about two years until the fashion for Disco faded in 1980. During the period of Norman's ownership, the Embassy played host to nearly all the prominent names in the entertainment, fashion and young society worlds - a melting pot and crossroads of many cultures. As at New York's Studio 54, everyone came out to party, young and old, including many who had never come out on the scene before.

He was a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. . Also published in Historical Records of Australian Science 7 (1): 109‚Äì122, . An abridged version is online at the web site of the Australian Academy of Science. First published in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 18, (MUP), 2012. Biography Thomas Room was born on 10 November 1902, near London, England. He studied mathematics in St John's College, Cambridge, and was a wrangler in 1923. He continued at Cambridge as a graduate student, and was elected as a fellow in 1925, but instead took a position at the University of Liverpool. He returned to Cambridge in 1927, at which time he completed his PhD, with a thesis supervised by H. F. Baker. Room remained at Cambridge until 1935, when he moved to the University of Sydney.. During World War II he worked for the Australian government, helping to decrypt Japanese communications. He was one of four in a \\"cypher section\\" at the University of Sydney who were recruited by Eric Nave and moved to FRUMEL in June 1941. He moved to the Army Central Bureau with Nave in October 1942. After the war, Room returned to the University of Sydney, where he was dean of the faculty of science from 1952 to 1956 and again from 1960 to 1965. He also held visiting positions at the University of Washington in 1948, and the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University in 1957... He retired from Sydney in 1968 but took short- term positions afterwards at Westfield College in London and the Open University before returning to Australia in 1974. He died on 2 April 1986. Room married Jessica Bannerman, whom he met in Sydney, in 1937; they had one son and two daughters.. Research Room's PhD work concerned generalizations of the Schl√§fli double six, a configuration formed by the 27 lines on a cubic algebraic surface. In 1938 he published the book The geometry of determinantal loci through the Cambridge University Press. Nearly 500 pages long, the book combines methods of synthetic geometry and algebraic geometry to study higher- dimensional generalizations of quartic surfaces and cubic surfaces. It describes many infinite families of algebraic varieties, and individual varieties in these families, following a unifying principle that nearly all loci arising in algebraic geometry can be expressed as the solution to an equation involving the determinant of an appropriate matrix.Review of The geometry of determinantal loci by Virgil Snyder (1939), Bulletin of the AMS 45: 499‚Äì501, . In the postwar period, Room shifted the focus of his work to Clifford algebra and spinor groups. Later, in the 1960s, he also began investigating finite geometry, and wrote a textbook on the foundations of geometry. Room invented Room squares in a brief note published in 1955.. A Room square is an n √ó n grid in which some of the cells are filled by sets of two of the numbers from 0 to n in such a way that each number appears once in each row or column and each two-element set occupies exactly one cell of the grid. Although Room squares had previously been studied by Robert Richard Anstice,. Anstice's work had become forgotten and Room squares were named after Room. In his initial work on the subject, Room showed that, for a Room square to exist, n must be odd and cannot equal 3 or 5. It was later shown by W. D. Wallis in 1973 that these are necessary and sufficient conditions: every other odd value of n has an associated Room square. The nonexistence of a Room square for n = 5 and its existence for n = 7 can both be explained in terms of configurations in projective geometry. Despite retiring in 1968, Room remained active mathematically for several more years, and published the book Miniquaternion geometry: An introduction to the study of projective planes in 1971 with his student Philip B. Kirkpatrick. Awards and honours In 1941, Room won the Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal of the Australian National Research Council and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society..Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal , Australian Academy of Science. Retrieved 6 June 2010. He was one of the Foundation Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science, chartered in 1954.

As in other works by Puig, the story is formally experimental, consisting of mostly unattributed dialogue, digressing into stories within stories. It also bears many of Puig favorite motifs, including sexuality and leftist revolutionary politics. Plot introduction The novel is set in Greenwich Village, near Washington Square. Larry, a poor and otherwise-unemployed former college student, accepts a part-time job taking care of 74-year-old Mr. Ramirez. Mr. Ramirez is an Argentine expatriate who has apparently lost his memory, as well as his understanding of basic concepts such as love and sexual arousal. Though the two men are ostensibly strangers, their conversations reveal that they may somehow have intimate knowledge of each other's pasts. Abruptly and without clear explanation, dialogue often digresses into elaborate melodramatic reenactments of events that may or may not have happened to the two men.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and represents a major expansion of the Old Town Hall Historic District, which was listed in 1972. When first listed in 1972, the district consisted of a cluster of buildings around Salem's Old Town Hall on Derby Square and Essex, Washington, and Front Streets. The Essex Street pedestrian Mall was closed off to vehicular traffic in 1976 and was made open only to pedestrians and delivery vehicles. The 1983 expansion significantly enlarged the district to encompass a significant portion of Salem's historic downtown. It includes two properties previously listed individually on the National Register: the Joshua Ward House, and City Hall, both on Washington Street. Joshua Ward House The Joshua Ward House is a historic house at 148 Washington Street, built in 1784. It was added separately to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Salem City Hall Salem City Hall, the oldest continually run city hall in America, opened in 1837 and is located at 93 Washington Street in Salem. Constructed in the style of Greek Revival, it was added separately to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It notably survived the Great Salem Fire of 1914. Salem Old Town Hall Old Town Hall is the earliest surviving municipal structure in Salem (dating from 1816‚Äì17) and is an outstanding example of Federal architecture. The second floor of the building, Great Hall, has always been used as a public hall, and contained town offices until 1837. The first floor, originally designed as a public market, now houses the Salem Museum. Salem - 1820 The building and its Derby Square site maintain historical associations with Salem's prominent 18th and 19th century Derby family for whom Derby Square, Derby Wharf, Derby Street and the two Derby houses on the Salem waterfront were named. The building contains elements attributed to both Charles Bulfinch, the most influential Boston architect of the Federal period, and Samuel McIntire, Salem's renowned architect and woodcarver. The structure was saved from demolition by Salem preservation architect Philip Horton Smith in the 1930s, and underwent a partial restoration in the 1970s.

It is set on a rise facing south. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof and single end chimney. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance set in the leftmost bay. The brick on the facade and east side is laid in Flemish bond, with short-end bricks highlighted by their blackened ends. Window and door openings are topped by segmented arches, and there is a stringcourse of corbelled brickwork between the first and second floors. The brick exhibits patching in a number of places, where openings were once made but afterwards closed during restoration. The house is believed to have been under construction by farmer and brick-maker Thomas Duston at the time of the 1697 attack on Haverhill during King William's War.H. D. Kilgore, \\"The Story of Hannah Duston\\" (1940) It was during this raid that his wife, Hannah Duston, in bed at their existing home a half mile away, was captured by Native Americans. Cotton Mather later wrote a popular captivity narrative about her experience.Cotton Mather,(1702) Magnalia Christi AmericanaDustin Griffin (2014). \\"Cotton Mather and the Emerson Family,\\" Massachusetts Historical Review, 16, 1-48. doi:10.5224/masshistrevi.16.1.0001 Deed research however, suggests that the Dustins never occupied this house, and that it was probably built for the Kimball family. The house is one of a very small number of brick houses in eastern Massachusetts from the First Period of colonial architecture, and consequently provides an important window into masonry techniques of the period. Its form is also unusual for northeastern Massachusetts, and more closely resembles the stone-enders of early Rhode Island. The building underwent a major restoration in 1946 after its acquisition by a Dustin family association.

The now predominantly residential district is bounded on the north and west by East Street, running from its junction with North Main and High Streets to Jeffrey's Neck Road. The eastern boundary includes the Ipswich River and Turkey Shore Road from its junction with Labor- in-Vain Road to Green Street, and the southern boundary runs along Green Street to North Main. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Historically, the district encompasses the part of Ipswich that served as its access to the sea. The very earliest structures in the new settlement were built in the area near what is now Town Wharf, and development radiated from that point. In the early years, this was a center of economic activity, with lumber and fishing interests shipping their products out. A shipbuilding industry was active in the area, and there were workshops for a diversity of trades, including pottery and tanning. By the 19th century these early industries were in decline, and industrial activity in other parts of the town took over in importance, so the area began to develop a more residential character. The early First Period, Georgian, and Federalist houses began to be joined by 19th century housing featuring Greek Revival, Second Empire, and Italianate architecture. The Green Street bridge tied the area to the South Green area, leading to some further development along Turkey Shore Road, south of the Ipswich River. The district has more than sixty houses representing these periods of development.

The film was released on October 17, 2008 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The film chronicles a real-life crew training and competing in the 44th Transpacific Yacht Race aboard a TP52 class sailing yacht, Morning Light.  Plot  Morning Light is a documentary that follows the youngest crew (by average age) to compete in the Transpac. All crew members were between 18 and 23 at the time. The film follows the formation of the Morning Light sailing team, their six months of training in advance of the yacht race, and finally the weeklong Los Angeles to Honolulu race itself. The crew numbered 15 young sailors of varied experience: Chris Branning, Graham Brant-Zawadzki, Chris Clark, Charlie Enright, Jesse Fielding, Robbie Kane, Steve Manson, Chris Schubert, Kate Theisen, Mark Towill (at 18, the youngest crew member), Genny Tulloch, navigator Piet van Os, Chris Welch, Kit Will and the 21-year-old skipper, Jeremy Wilmot.  Production  Executive producer Roy Disney was a sailing enthusiast and Transpac competitor who held several sailing speed records including the Los Angeles to Honolulu monohull time record, which he set on his boat Pyewacket in July 1999. The concept for the film came from TP52 Class Association executive director Tom Pollack, who passed it on to former ESPN producer Leslie DeMeuse, who has worked with Disney on other sailing-related film projects. In early 2006, Roy E. Disney, longtime sailing master Robbie Haines and DeMeuse considered 538 applications and picked 30 finalists, from which 15 were chosen in a week of selection trials in Long Beach, California. Training began in Honolulu, Hawaii in January 2007, for two weeks at a time through late June, with time off in May. The team trained aboard the Morning Light, which Disney purchased from software executive Philippe Kahn. Filming coincided with training and the race itself, which started July 15, 2007 and concluded ten days later.  Release  The film was released on October 17, 2008. Prior to theatrical release, private screenings were held for yacht racing enthusiasts, including one hosted by Roy E. Disney for U.S. Sailing on March 14, 2008 in Newport, Rhode Island.

Built in 1895-96 to a design by John Ashton, the Colonial Revival brick building is the oldest firehouse building in the city, and its design was used in the development of other city fire stations. Shuttered by budget cuts in 2009, it was reopened in 2012, and continues to serve its original purpose. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history Engine House No. 6 is set at the top of Prospect Hill on Lawrence's northeast side. It is a densely-populated residential area, with the Richardsonian Romanesque John R. Rollins School across the street serving as a complementary municipal site. From the front the brick building appears to be 2-1/2 stories in height, but it has a full third story below due to its steeply sloping lot. The front facade is three bays wide, with the left two taken up by a projecting section that includes two truck bays, with groups of three sash windows above, and a hip-roof dormer (faced in copper) which also has three windows. The right bay has a clapboarded entrance, which was once an open porch, with an oriel window above. The truck bay openings are topped by granite lintels, and there is a granite beltcourse around the building just below their level. The north facade has a rounded bay section, affording views down the hill. The firehouse was designed by John Ashton, a local architect, who deliberately embellished the building's design with details taken from the neighboring Rollins School. It was built in 1895-96 to address the need for fire protection in the rapidly developing Prospect Hill neighborhood. The building's design was reused in 1908 by the city for its No. 9 (Bailey Street) station, adding only a hose drying tower. The firehouse was one of three closed due to budget concerns in 2009.

It is a part of Lynn Public Schools, and the largest school in the Lynn school system. The name \\"Lynn English High School\\" comes from the Boston area secondary education practice of establishing an English secondary school to provide working-class students with curriculum designed to prepare for entry into the workforce directly from high school. This was in contrast to Latin or Classical secondary schools, which provided education on the classics for future academic pursuits such as college, ministry, and further academia. Lynn Classical High School, located in West Lynn, offered a classical education option to Lynn students when it opened. Throughout the later 1900s, the curriculum across Lynn high schools was standardized; currently, both schools offer college preparatory curriculum. In 2019, the student population was 1,786 according to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education School Report Card.http://reportcards.doe.mass.edu/2019/01630510 According to the most recent graduation data in the report card, in 2018 the 4-year graduation rate was 72.7%.

We foster respectful, responsible behavior and leadership in a safe and supportive environment.\\" School history In the mid- to late 1800s, there was one Lynn High School located in downtown Lynn. In 1892, construction of the first English High School in Lynn began on Essex Street. The class of 1889 was the first to graduate from under the Lynn English High School name. According to the Boston Globe, the original building was the biggest non-factory building in Lynn (home to a General Electric plant) and boasted three stories with 60 classrooms, an assembly hall, and \\"chemical, physics, and botanical laboratories... electrical works and library.\\"\\"One Fatally Injured at Lynn School Fire\\", The Boston Globe, March 30, 1924, page one and page twelve. The school garnered news attention in 1893 as the first American public school to offer a course in Spanish. In 1907, a complete set of printing presses was installed in the school and \\"manual training\\" courses began. A four-story extension of the original Essex Street building was completed in 1914, and in 1916 a $325,000 gymnasium was added. On March 29, 1924, the Essex Street building caught fire with $450,000 of damage. One firefighter was killed. The school has been in its current location on Goodridge Street in East Lynn since 1931.https://lynnenglishalumni.org/about-us/history-2/ Construction of the Goodridge St building cost $1,800,000. Upon completion of the Goodridge Street building, it was planned that Lynn English High School would relocate and open under the new name Eastern Senior High School. This meant that Lynn English High School would cease to exist. The Alumni Association staged a parade with over 2000 people, 100 cars, and a drum and bugle corps to protest the new name and demand the Lynn English High School name be retained.\\"2000 March at Lynn in Protest of Name\\", The Boston Globe, July 15, 1931, page seventeen. Ultimately the name change was cancelled and the new building took the Lynn English name. The current building was constructed in the shape of an E, which can be seen from an aerial view. A notable feature of the school is the Lincoln Foyer, an entryway adjacent to the auditorium that holds a lifesize statue of Abraham Lincoln. The statue was donated by the class of 1934; a 2010 restoration effort was led by local historian Tim Ring, a Lynn English teacher and alum. For several decades, the boots Abraham Lincoln had worn on the night of his assassination were owned by a Lynn English teacher, Ruth Hatch, who brought them to school and allowed students to wear them before donating the boots to the National Park Service in 1947.Laidler, John. \\"Lincoln's boots made journey to Lynn\\", The Boston Globe, June 3, 2010, page P3.

Site plan of the Essex Company complex as it appeared in 1850. Note that north is at the bottom of the plan.To attract manufacturers, the Essex Company dammed the river with the Great Stone Dam and created a canal to provide a power source for the future businesses. The machine shop was created at the head of the canal as part of a foundry to service the Essex Company and tenant manufacturers. The facility consisted of the machine shop, a foundry, a forge shop containing 32 forges, and a chimney connected via an underground flue to the forges. The entire complex was warmed by steam and had power provided by two Fourneyron water turbines. A branch of the Boston and Maine Railroad encircled the complex to allow for delivery of raw materials and coal. In 1850, the complex employed 400 but was designed with the capacity to employ 800-1000 workers.

It consists of a compact group of properties associated with the Essex Institute, founded in 1848 and merged in 1992 into the Peabody Essex Museum. Listed by increasing street number, they are: the Crowninshield-Bentley House, the Gardner-Pingree House (a National Historic Landmark), the John Tucker Daland House, and the Phillips Library (the latter two are physically connected). The John Ward House, which fronts on Brown Street but shares the 132 Essex Street address, is another National Historic Landmark within the district. The Andrew Safford House at 13 Washington Square West, built in 1819, was said to be the most expensive home in New England at the time. The principal buildings of the district are the Daland House and the Phillips Library, the latter of which was the main Essex Institute building. The Daland House was built in 1851, the Library in 1857, and the combination now serve as the library and research facility of the Peabody Essex Museum. The Library is a two-story building, although the second floor is two normal stories high (with suitably large windows), and originally served as exhibition space. The area behind the Phillips Library and south of Brown Street is a garden area that includes two other historical structures: the Vaughan Doll House, a modest late 17th century one-room structure that may have been a Quaker meeting house, and the Lyle-Tapley Shoe Shop. They both stand near the John Ward House, which faces into the garden as well. Just to the east of the Daland House stands the Gardner-Pingree House, an elegant Federal mansion built in 1804 by noted Salem architect Samuel McIntire. To its east, at the corner of Essex and Washington Square West, stands the Bentley-Crowninshield House, a c. 1727 Georgian house that was relocated from a site across Essex Street in 1860. The Andrew-Safford House is behind the Bentley-Crowninshield House, facing Salem Common. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972; all of the properties in the district were also included in the Salem Common Historic District in 1976. On December 8, 2017, much to the dismay of Salem residents, Dan L. Monroe, PEM's Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo Director and CEO, issued a press release announcing that the 42,000 linear feet of historical documents will be permanently relocated to Rowley, MA and Plummer Hall and Daland House, the two historic buildings which had housed the Phillips Library, will be utilized as office and meeting space.

It was produced through a collaboration between Polycom and Ericsson. G.719 is based on modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) coding. It incorporates elements of Polycom's Siren22 codec (22 kHz) and Ericsson codec technology, as well as Polycom's Siren7 and Siren14 codecs (G.722.1 and G.722.1 Annex C), which have been used in videoconferencing systems for many years. As ITU-T Recommendation G.719, it was approved on June 13, 2008. G.719 is optimized for both speech and music. It is based on transform coding with adaptive time-resolution, adaptive bit-allocation and low complexity lattice vector quantization. The computational complexity is quite low (18 floating-point MIPS) for an efficient high-quality compressor. The codec operates on 20 ms frames, and the algorithmic delay end-to-end is 40 ms. The encoder input and decoder output are sampled at 48 kHz. In addition to the nominal bit rates of 32, 48 and 64 kbit/s, the G.719 codec has an inherent feature of flexible rate selection. In fact, it is possible to accommodate any rate between 32 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s by steps of 4 kbit/s. Moreover, the codec can also provide higher rates than 64 kbit/s and up to 128 kbit/s. Amendment 1 of the ITU-T G.719 specification defined the use of the ISO base media file format (ISO/IEC 14496-12 a.k.a. MPEG-4 Part 12) as container for the G.719 bitstream. It also defined stereo and multichannel use of G.719 bitstreams in the ISO base media file format. It addresses non-conversational use cases of the codec (e.g. call waiting music playback and recording of teleconferencing sessions, voice mail messages).ITU-T (2009) ITU-T Recommendation G.719 Retrieved on 2009-06-17 Thus, media file formats such as MP4 (audio/mp4 or video/mp4) and 3GP (audio/3GPP and video/3GPP) can contain G.719-encoded audio.RFC 5404 - RTP Payload Format for G.719, Page 18, Retrieved on 2009-06-17 RFC 5404 defined media type audio/G719.

A wing extends to the rear of the main block, housing most of the book stacks. Middleton's first library collection was established in 1772 as a private lending collection. Middleton native Charles L. Flint in 1879 offered the town funding and a seed collection of books to establish a public library. This initial collection was merged with the private collection, and was initially housed in a room in town hall. After Flint's death in 1889, the town received a $10,000 bequest from his estate. The resulting building was designed by George Loring and Stanford Phipps, regional architects known for their public buildings, and was completed in 1891.

Fort Pickering operated as a strategic coastal defense and military barracks for Salem Harbor during a variety of periods, serving as a fortification from the Anglo-Dutch Wars through World War II. Construction of the original fort began in 1643 and it saw use as a military installation into the 20th century. Fort Miller (Fort Darby prior to the Civil War) in Marblehead also defended Salem's harbor from the 1630s through the American Civil War. Fort Pickering is a First System fortification named for Colonel Timothy Pickering, born in Salem, adjutant general of the Continental Army and secretary of war in 1795.Roberts, pp. 407‚Äì408 Today, the remains of the fort are open to the public as part of the Winter Island Maritime Park, operated by the City of Salem. 17th century Winter Island at the time of English settlement in the early 17th century was an island separated from the mainland, held as common land by the Proprietors and used as a fortification and for fishing activities.Perley, 1924 In 1643 Fort William was begun on the island.  18th century  Circa 1702, during Queen Anne's War, Fort William was renamed Fort Anne (for then Queen Anne), and was rebuilt around 1706 under the direction of the Royal Engineers, who were earlier sent by King William III to fortify the colonies.Finch, 1998: Salem Observer 1978 It is unclear how much was accomplished, as a debate on whether the town or the province should fund the rebuilding lasted past 1711, when the war ended for the American colonies. In 1735 the Massachusetts General Court provided 600 pounds to rebuild the fort to hold 15 guns. It was rebuilt again by the town and known as Fort Number Two in Patriot hands during the American Revolutionary War. In 1794, the City of Salem ceded the fort to the federal government and a new fort was constructed in its place, part of the first system of U.S. fortifications. The 1794 U.S. Army report on fortifications called for the fort to have eight artillery pieces, a blockhouse, and a magazine. The fort's garrison was proposed to consist of one officer and 22 enlisted men.American State Papers. Military Affairs. Vol. 1. Document No. 22. pg. 73. Major repairs to the fort were conducted in 1796 and a restoration in 1799. Later in 1799 it was renamed Fort Pickering in honor of Timothy Pickering, then Secretary of State of the U.S. Hand-drawn picture of Fort Pickering from the Pictorial Fieldbook of the War of 1812 by Benson Lossing (1869) One of three 19th- century ammunition bunkers  19th century  The fort was rebuilt in 1800 and 1808 to mount six guns as part of the second system of U.S. fortifications. In a report on the conditions of fortifications of the United States submitted to Congress by President Jefferson on January 6, 1809, the following is stated regarding Fort Pickering - \\"The fort and block house, ... with a magazine under it, have been repaired and a new barrack erected.\\"American State Papers. Military Affairs. Vol. 1. Document No. 84. pg. 238. Another report in December 1811 stated the fort was \\"an enclosed work of brick and sods, mounting six heavy guns, covered by a block house\\".Wade, p. 242 Regular Army commanders of the fort (combined with Fort Sewall in Marblehead) from 1800 to 1812 included Capt. Alexander D. Pope 1800‚Äì1802, a detachment of Capt. Nehemiah Freeman's company 1802‚Äì1803, no federal garrison 1804‚Äì1808, and Capt. Stephen Ranney 1809‚Äì1812.Wade, p. 247 Massachusetts militia camps on Winter Island in the 1850s and 1860s included Camp Sutton (1853, 1855), Camp Edmunds (1856), Camp Banks (1858), and Camp Gardner (1860s). Camp Sutton existed in 1853 and 1855. The camp was named for general William Sutton and was occupied by the 2nd Division. Camp Edmunds existed in 1856. The camp was named for Major General B.F. Edmunds and was occupied by the 4th Brigade. Camp Banks existed in 1858. The camp was named for Major General Nathaniel P. Banks and was occupied by the 2nd Division. The fort received another military restoration in the War of 1812. In 1820 it had a capacity of 11 guns.Manuel 2019, pp. 32‚Äì35 During the 19th century, the island was used primarily for fortification and in 1864 the City of Salem again ceded the island to the federal government in support of the Civil War efforts. Although the capacity remained at 11 guns, the area of the fort was increased, with earthwork parapets built outside the stone fort and gun embrasures added for improved protection. The magazine was also increased in size. To defend against land attack, the gorge at the rear of the fort was guarded by two curtain walls and a wet moat. The walls were part of a bombproof shelter with loopholes for small arms. Facilities outside the fort included a guard house, hospital/commissary, barracks/mess hall, stable, sink, and well.Manuel 2020, pp. 68‚Äì70 An armament report by Major Charles E. Blunt dated January 31, 1865 shows the fort had six 24-pounder smoothbore guns, three 32-pounder rifles, and two 24-pounder rifles.Manuel 2019, p. 42 It was also called Salem Barracks in that war. From May 1864 to June 1865 Fort Pickering was garrisoned successively by the 3rd and 17th Unattached Companies Massachusetts Volunteer Militia.Higginson, pp. 318, 323  20th century  Abandoned seaplane hangar at former Fort Pickering, 2016 In 1935 most of the land on Winter Island became the newly established Coast Guard Air Station Salem. The air station had a hangar and ramp for seaplanes. Aircraft from the station conducted anti-submarine patrols during World War II and search and rescue missions until it was closed in 1971. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In 1994, the National Register designated the entire collection of cultural resources at Winter Island and Fort Pickering as the Winter Island Historic District and Archaeological District.

In it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History The settlement was established in October 1984 by the Poalei Agudat Yisrael movement, and was named after the biblical city of Nahaliel and a book by Isaac Breuer, the founder of Poalei Agudat Yisrael. According to ARIJ, Nahliel was built on land confiscated from two Palestinian towns; 396 dunams from al- Ittihad and 19 dunams from al-Zaitounah.Al-Itihad Town Profile (Beitillu, Jammala & Deir 'Ammar), ARIJ, pp. 16-17AL-Zaytouneh Town Profile, ARIJ, p. 18 Most of the founders were members of the religious youth movement Ezra. The settlers initially lived in ten temporary houses that were not connected to electricity or water supplies. A trailer carrying water was delivered each day for several weeks until a water tower was erected, which was also supplied by a daily delivery. A minimal supply of electricity was provided by a tiny generator that the builders left for their use during the night. Until the start of the First Intifada in 1987, relationships between the settlers and residents of surrounding Palestinian villages were positive, with Palestinians visiting the settlement and settlers using the shops in the adjacent villages. During the Second Intifada, two Israeli women were ambushed and wounded by Palestinian militants near Nahliel. In March 2005 a group of 30 to 40 Jewish seminary students used clubs and stones to beat eight Palestinian men employed in Nahliel as they were entering the settlement. Dror Etkes of Peace Now, writing in 2005, stated that some of the residents were \\"radical settlers\\" on the fringes of ultra-Orthodox society, making it atypical among the ultra- Orthodox settlements.Dror Etkes, Lara Friedman, \\"The Ultra-Orthodox Jews in the West Bank\\", Peace Now, October 2005. North and east of Nahliel are lands belonging to the Palestinians of the village of Beitillu, whose residents are only allowed to work on their orchards for a few days a year. Significant damage to the Palestinian olive groves adjacent to the settlement was caused in 2012, but the culprits were unknown. The area is surrounded by barbed wire.Amira Hass (16 July 2012). \\"Uprooting Palestinian trees - and lives\\". Haaretz (Tel Aviv).

It is located at Gale's Head, the northeastern point of the main Marblehead peninsula, on a promontory that overlooks the entrance to Marblehead Harbor. Until 1814 it was called Gale's Head Fort. History Gale's Head was first fortified in 1634, and was one of the oldest English coastal fortifications in the United States. A more permanent fortification was built in 1742 during King George's War and it served through the French and Indian War.Roberts, p. 410 Gale's Head Fort was rebuilt in 1775 during the American Revolutionary War. It was garrisoned by Colonel John Glover's Marblehead Regiment in 1775‚Äì76. After the American Revolution, the federal government took over the property during an expansion of the nation's coast defenses from 1794 to 1807, which is known as the First System of U.S. fortifications. A blockhouse was added in 1794, with further rebuilding in 1799; magazines from both of these rebuildings remain. Fort Sewall was also rebuilt in 1809 with 8 guns as part of the Second System (1807 to 1820).

Despite lacking the ammunition and powder needed to sink or drive off the two frigates, the fort's garrison was able to bluff the British by running out all of their guns and acting as though they were preparing to attack. Faced with a 44-gun frigate and the defensive batteries of a fort, the British elected to retreat, none the wiser. In 1814 the fort was named for Samuel Sewall (1757‚Äì1814), who served as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court from 1800 until his death in 1814. He was the great-grandson of the Salem witch trials judge of the same name, also a chief justice of the colony's highest court. From April 1816 to March 1821 Fort Sewall was garrisoned by Company B of the Light Artillery Regiment with about 60 soldiers.Ancestry.com, U.S. Returns of Military Posts, 1806-1916.

History Between the 1940s and 1960s, Wyoming Highway 70 connected with former Colorado State Highway 129, which used to connect US 40 with Wyoming 70. During the time Highway 129 existed, WY 70 didn't exist as it does now. Only the western part from SH 129 to Baggs was designated as Highway 70.Former Colorado SH 129 Former Colorado State Highway 129 is now Routt County Route 129. Recreation The scenic by-way crosses the Continental Divide The Continental Divide Trail traverses Battle Pass. Resupply is available in the nearby Town of Encampment to the east.

A new chimney core was added on the north side late in the 18th century, and a second two-story wing was added on the northwest. Although the house is traditionally dated to c. 1660 (with ownership of the land traced to 1635), the stylistic construction techniques indicate a later construction date.

Though he graduated one season before the NCAA implemented the three-point field goal, his propensity for sinking deep two-pointers earned him a reputation as one of the premier long-range shooters of his era in the Big Eight Conference. A 6‚Äô5‚Äù (1.96 m) swingman born in Omaha, Nebraska, he was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA and played professionally in the CBA. College Kellogg enrolled at Kansas in 1982 after a standout career at Northwest High School in Omaha, where he was a three-time all-state selection and was recruited by over 150 colleges before choosing KU over Iowa, Colorado, Nebraska, and Creighton.Hoop Heritage: Kansas found three wizards He played sparingly as a freshman under head coach Ted Owens, averaging 3.9 points on 41.0% shooting from the field in just over ten minutes per game.Rock Chalk Zone: Ron Kellogg Though he showed only modest improvement as a sophomore in 1983-84, averaging 6.1 points per game on 43.4% shooting, the departure of Owens and the arrival of Brown prior to that season marked the beginning of a basketball revival on the Jayhawk campus. As a junior in 1984-85, Kellogg was plugged into the starting small forward position opposite heralded freshman Danny Manning, giving the Jayhawks a highly productive combination at forward. Kellogg would thrive in the starting role, leading the team in scoring at 17.6 points per game on 57.6% shooting ‚Äì an extremely high percentage for a perimeter player, especially given his significant number of field goal attempts from what today would be three-point territory. During one memorable stretch of Saturday games that season, he scored 30 points against Wichita State, 31 against Colorado, 39 against Nebraska, 34 against Memphis State, and 34 against Oklahoma.Kellogg Went Snap! Crackle! Pop! According to Kellogg, his performance in the Nebraska game, in which he hit 16 of his 19 shots from the field and all seven of his free throws en route to establishing a new Devaney Center scoring record, was inspired when ‚Äú[m]y ex-girlfriend walked in[to the arena] with her boyfriend. That kind of teed me off. I wanted to prove a point after I saw that.‚Äù Meanwhile, his exploits in KU's 82-76 upset victory over Oklahoma, which included 14-of-19 shooting from the field and seven of his team's final 11 points in the last 1:53, were chronicled in a feature article in the March 4, 1985 issue of Sports Illustrated entitled ‚ÄúKellogg Went Snap! Crackle! Pop!‚Äù (an allusion to the popular Kellogg's-brand Rice Krispies breakfast cereal). Although the Jayhawks were eliminated by Auburn in the second round of the NCAA tournament, Kellogg's scoring feats earned him a selection to the All-Big Eight first team. He was also awarded All-District 5 honors by the USBWA and, following the season, was named to the U.S. men's basketball team at the 1985 World University Games. Kellogg's senior year in 1985-86 proved to be one of the most successful seasons in Kansas basketball history. With \\"Special K\\" moving to shooting guard alongside fellow Omaha native Cedric Hunter, and Manning joined in the frontcourt by 7'1\\" future NBA pivotman Greg Dreiling, the versatile Calvin Thompson, and super-sub Archie Marshall, the Jayhawks boasted one of the most talented lineups in the country. The team did not disappoint, rolling to a 35-4 record and earning a trip to the 1986 Final Four in Dallas, where they suffered a 71-67 defeat at the hands of Duke. Despite the loss, Kellogg played well in his final career game, engaging in a scoring duel with Blue Devil star Johnny Dawkins and keeping the Jayhawks in the game with 22 points on 11-of-15 shooting.1952 team: KU‚Äôs best ever Kellogg finished the season as the team's second-leading scorer behind Manning at 15.9 points per game on 55.2% field goal shooting, and was again selected to the All-Big Eight first team. He concluded his Jayhawk career with 1,508 points, a total which currently places him 17th on KU's all-time scoring list. Professional Following his career at Kansas, Kellogg was selected in the second round of the 1986 NBA draft, going to the Atlanta Hawks with the 42nd overall pick.TheDraftReview - Ron Kellogg He was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a draft-day deal,Wheelin' and Dealin': Draft-day trades of the past 15 years but failed to make the Lakers roster and never appeared in an NBA game. He signed on with the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Association, where he would be reunited with former KU teammates Thompson and Hunter. During his second season with the Sizzlers, his teammates also included former KU and Boston Celtics star Jo Jo White, who was 41 years old at the time, and troubled ex-New York City playground legend Lloyd Daniels.Valenti, John, \\"Swee'pea and Other Playground Legends.\\" New York: Michael Kesend Publishing, 1990. Kellogg also played for the Omaha Racers, Savannah Spirits and Yakima Sun Kings in four CBA seasons, averaging 11.5 points in 147 games. After leaving the CBA, Kellogg pursued a career in business and now coaches high school basketball in Baton Rouge. Legacy Kellogg's claim to fame was his silky left-handed jump shot, which netted him a reputation as the best shooter in Nebraska prep historyNebraska Sports Hall of Fame: Ron Kellogg and one of the greatest ever to wear a Jayhawk uniform. When the Omaha World-Herald asked four scouts to recall Kellogg's game as part of a 2008 retrospective, each of them responded with the same two words: \\"incredible shooter.\\" This sentiment is shared by Chuck Woodling of the Lawrence Journal-World, who claims that ‚Äúin nearly four decades of watching KU basketball players I‚Äôve never seen a more accurate shooter than Ron Kellogg.‚ÄùKelloggs two-deep on talent Kansas head coach Bill Self, a graduate assistant on the 1985-86 KU team, recalls a shooting drill at practice in which the players would launch 30 to 35 jump shots from the elbow within a five-minute span. As Self recalled, \\"On the fourth day we ran it, Ronnie finally missed one. Do you hear me? He went three consecutive days in a rapid- fire shooting drill without missing!\\" During his KU career, both Kellogg's basketball talents and his colorful persona were the subject of entertaining writeups in Sports Illustrated. In the magazine's 1985-86 college basketball preview, he was characterized as ‚Äúa streak shooter who gets so worked up when he's hot that he sometimes forgets the score, the time remaining and the law of averages. . . . [He] thinks he's open even when someone's hanging on his arms.‚Äù His shot selection was summarized courtesy of coach Larry Brown: \\"I'm always yelling, ‚ÄòNo! No! . . . Great shot!‚Äô‚Äù1985-86 Men‚Äôs College Basketball Preview: #7 Kansas In another column, he was labeled a ‚Äúborn flake‚Äù who, during a critical time-out in a game against Memphis State his junior year, allegedly told a bewildered Brown, ‚ÄúCoach, we need to fix the whirlpool.‚Äù The magazine later reported that Kellogg, along with fellow seniors Thompson and Dreiling, showed up for his final home game at Allen Fieldhouse wearing a tuxedo.The Week: Feb. 25 ‚Äì March 2 References Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Atlanta Hawks draft picks Category:Basketball players at the 1986 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from Nebraska Category:Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball players Category:Omaha Racers players Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball) Category:Savannah Spirits players Category:Shooting guards Category:Small forwards Category:Sportspeople from Omaha, Nebraska Category:Topeka Sizzlers players Category:Universiade medalists in basketball Category:Universiade silver medalists for the United States Category:Yakima Sun Kings players ","title":"Ron Kellogg"},{"id":"18747070","text":"Stambolovo (, ) is a village in central southern Bulgaria, part of Haskovo Province.

Built in 1810, the brick -story structure is notable as a well-preserved example of Federal-style architecture in the area, and for its role in the early history of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA, now Historic New England). The house was built by Levi Preston and Stephen Whipple for Samuel Fowler, Jr., a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and early Danvers industrialist. Analysis of the records of the house construction (archived at the Peabody Essex Museum) show that was little changed at the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The house was purchased by SPNEA in 1912, and was its second acquisition after the Swett-Ilsley House in Newbury, Massachusetts. Its relatively plain appearance led to some disagreement within the organization between preservationists seeking to preserve all types of architecture and those seeking to acquire more elegant properties. SPNEA operated the property as a house museum for some time, but sold it into private hands.

It was serialised in comic weekly Pep in late 1974/early 1975, before being published in its entirety in 1978. One of its characters, Franka, went on to become a star in her own right. Plot The opening sequence chronicles a burglary and the prosecution of the offenders. The pieces of evidence are handed over to the Criminology Museum (a group of crime-experts who are not criminals), just at that moment, a job applicant (the bearded Jarko Jansen) arrives. He meets the staff (Franka in particular) and gets the job. Jarko solves his first case in cooperation with Officer Noordenwind by subjecting the victim to a lie-test, using the number of scratches in a vinyl record. Back at work, the Museum receives a visit from Oscar Buhne, who wants to discuss the script for a crime-movie. Franka, who works as a secretary, asks if anyone fancies a cup of coffee and notes that Professor Philip Factotum has got a visitor. While Jarko checks the script, Franka goes round to have a talk with Frikko Falegier, who wants to sell a crossbow once used to kill Robin Hood. Put off by his rude behaviour, she takes the bow with her, but on her way back to the car, she is approached by the professor's visitor. Without recognising her, he asks for the address of the building that Franka just came out of; she misleads him by sending him round the block, and returns to the shop where she hides in what appears to be a secret elevator. The man arrives and takes the elevator to a hidden basement where he orders a war-plane by computer. The door closes upon his exit, leaving Franka stranded and stuck in a harness. Oscar Buhne returns to the Criminology Museum to collect the revised script. Back at his hotel room, he transforms into the man who ordered the war-plane. He uses Jarko's script to stage a burglary at the Royal Printers, which produces the droppollo, the currency of the fictional Republic of Oceanaqua. He prints a suitcase full of money to finance the plane but betrayed him, and upon his arrival at the hotel he is caught. When Jarko reads his own script in the morning paper, he wants to resign. Meanwhile, Franka manages to escape by pretending to be a harness that fell down. Back at work, the officer, Jarko, Franka and Professor Factotum exchange recent experiences, and thanks to the latter, they learn that the offender is Argos Attak, a man who borrowed books about escape from deportation. At that moment, he cuts short his trip to the police station by using a sleeping gas-filled smoke-bomb that was inside his shoe. Everyone chases him, but Jarko, Franka and Bars (the officer's dog) are exposed to a second bomb. When Jarko regains conscientiousness, they find themselves inside the war-plane flying to Oceanaqua. Franka already knows the situation, that the Pefirio Orca movement managed to own the one military battle-ship at the republic. Once more, Argos explains that he stole the money and bought the plane to start a revolution to liberate Oceanaqua from the oppressor who recently gained power. The revolution takes place, the man who sold the plane is sent to prison, and Jarko and Franka have themselves a holiday.

The character's story was later continued in the graphic novel Tales of the Slayers, and in a Buffy crossover in the Season Eight \\"Time of Your Life\\" story arc, as well as in its motion comic companion, in which she is voiced by Michelle Wong. In Fray, Melaka is depicted as the latest in the mystical line of vampire Slayers, chosen ones born with the strength and skill to fight the forces of evil, over 200 years in the future. However, unlike other vampire Slayers, Mel is unusual in that she was one of a pair of twins; her brother Harth somehow inherited the psychic aspects of a Slayer's abilities, leaving her with only the strength, agility and other physical attributes. Prior to Mel, a Slayer had not been \\"called\\" to receive her powers for centuries. Biography=Early life Melaka Fray, born in the 23rd century, grew up in Versi (Riverside), a small ghetto type district in Haddyn (Manhattan of the future).\\"Big City Girl\\" She grew up with her older sister Erin and her slightly older twin Harth.\\"Out of the Past In her teenage years, Melaka noticed that she had enhanced physical abilities over everyone else, but chose to believe that she was only good at things like that. Because of the low social status and the poor background from which her family came, she was forced to go 'grabbing' for food, which earned disapproval from her sister. At the age of fifteen, she took Harth with her on a grab, and the twins were attacked by a \\"lurk\\" (aka vampire) called Icarus.\\"Ready, Steady...\\" Melaka tried to fight Icarus off but ultimately lost to him and was thrown off a building while Icarus fed off of Harth, killing him. Melaka survived her fall, only to be blamed by Erin for Harth's death. The two sisters parted ways, with Erin joining up with \\"the laws\\" (i.e. the police equivalent) while Melaka continued her life of crime. Calling At the age of nineteen Melaka was a professional thief hired by a 'radie' (i.e. radiation caused mutant) named Gunther. Melaka also often looked after a fellow girl from Versi named Loo. Melaka was approached by a demon named Urkonn who told her that lurks were in fact ancient demons known as \\"vampires\\" and that she was destined to fight them. Mel was at first reluctant to accept or even believe that she was really \\"the Slayer\\", especially as she had never experienced any of the prophetic dreams that Urkonn described. However, after coming across a lurk while on a job for Gunther and being reminded of Harth's death, she agreed to train with Urkonn. While fighting, Melaka came face to face with Icarus and was horrified by the sight of her brother's killer, forcing Urkonn to jump to her defense. After recovering, Melaka used Gunther to track down Icarus, but she learned that Gunther had betrayed her to the law. As Erin took her sister away they were attacked by a group of lurks, who kidnapped Melaka and took her to their master: Harth. Harth revealed to his sister that, as her twin, he had received her Slayer dreams and was aware of vampire history. When he was bitten by Icarus, he knew that the only way to survive was to ingest their blood, thus becoming one of them. Due to his dreams, Harth had become leader to the lurks and was determined to bring back the Old Ones. Which he then reveals his obsession with her, claiming he had always loved her and loves causing her pain. After the shock of meeting her supposedly dead brother, Melaka escaped and informed Erin of what had happened. Erin refused to believe her, so Melaka returned home and rejoined Urkonn, where she discovered Loo's lifeless body in her apartment. This motivated her to wage war on the lurks as revenge for what they had done to her loved ones.\\"The Worst of It\\" Soon afterwards, Melaka was granted the Scythe‚Äîan ancient Slayer weapon‚Äîto aid her in the upcoming battle by Urkonn. Melaka tried to unite the city of Versi against the lurks but was ignored, but after watching Melaka fight against the lurks they realized what a true threat they were. This attracted the attention of Icarus, but before he and Melaka could truly face off, Erin appeared and crashed her flying car on top of Icarus as revenge for murdering her brother.\\"The Gateway\\" Melaka led a small group of people, including members of the law, against an army of lurks, while Harth attempted to unleash the Old Ones on Earth. Melaka defeated Harth's giant demon, but Harth escaped after claiming that things were not over between them not before kissing her then running off. Afterward, Melaka confronted Urkonn, informing him that she had figured out he was the one who murdered Loo. Urkonn claimed that he needed to do whatever he could to motivate her against the lurks, and Melaka killed him, doing it quickly because she considered Urkonn a \\"friend\\". She returned to her old job as a thief, but continued fighting lurks and preparing for anything else which came her way.\\"All Hell\\" Discovering her past Some time after the events of Fray, Gunther sent Melaka on a \\"special\\" grab, one he believed she would enjoy. Opening a chest, she was confronted with a bizarre \\"Spider-Monkey\\" creature which stole her scythe and led her through Haddyn to a building containing the Watchers' diaries. Reading about the lives of past Slayers, Melaka came to the conclusion that, although she was the only one of her kind in existence, she was not alone.\\"Tales\\" Meeting Buffy Summers Sometime after Fray and Tales, Melaka and Erin have teamed up to track down Harth. In one attempt to find him they hijack a moving van and discover a lurk, who they interrogate about Harth's whereabouts, the lurk reveals that Harth has teamed up with a mysterious crazy woman, who speaks in riddles and is very powerful. Mel and Erin head back to Mel's new home, the building in which she discovered the watchers diaries in Tales, to find out who the mysterious woman is. Erin meets Melaka's new pet, Gates, the 'spider-monkey' demon seen in Tales. Melaka reads about a building where she believes she can find answers to where Harth is. Erin drops her off on the building rooftop and leaves her to a fight an oncoming demon. Melaka and the demon fight but the demon is then transported away and is then replaced with Buffy Summers. After a small fight Buffy and Melaka both discover that they are both Slayers and the two soon trust each other. Melaka asks Buffy to follow her which she does, after some initial difficulty. Melaka takes Buffy to Gunther. Buffy reviews the Watcher Diaries, but finds no mention of the army of Slayers she created, to her severe disappointment. Melaka takes her on a mission to intercept some Lurks. However, she and Buffy come to disagreements about what action to take. Buffy states that they need to look at the big picture and allow the Lurks to continue their attack on an emergency vehicle in order to follow them to their larger hideout whereas Melaka opts to stop the Lurks where they are and save the lives of the paramedics. She leaps from their car, separating her from Buffy. After defeating the Lurks, she encounters the \\"madwoman\\" who is revealed to be a once again dark and insane Willow Rosenberg.Time of Your Life Part III, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight #18 She convinces Melaka to knock Buffy out, claiming that Buffy's return to the past and subsequent actions will cause the present/future world Melaka lives in to disappear. Melaka insists that she won't kill another Slayer, though Willow claims she need only keep her captive until after the temporal rift reopens and closes again, trapping Buffy in the future. However, a skirmish between Harth, who arrives angered at Willow for misleading him, and Gunther, who attacks Harth in retribution of an early ambush, allows Buffy to go free, attacking Erin and Melaka and escaping. Melaka ambushes Buffy at the site of the temporal rift claiming that she'll defeat her in order to \\"save the world\\" (the present). The two fight one another while Willow watches. Both note the other's skill, where Buffy has the advantage of a Slayer's memories and Melaka has the advantage of purpose and home turf. However, the rift opens and Buffy defeats Melaka. Willow intercepts Buffy, who is forced to reluctantly kill her in order to return to the past. Melaka is too late to stop her, feeling that she has failed once again. However, Erin notes that they still exist despite Buffy's return to the past; the timeline is apparently intact in spite of Buffy's knowledge and actions, and thus their future remain be.Time of Your Life Part IV, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight #19 Powers and abilities Melaka is a Slayer and so possesses the physical powers of one, which includes superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, durability, and accelerated healing. Her usual weapons include a blaster pistol and the mystical Slayer scythe. Notably, she does not possess the usual psychic powers of Slayers such as prophetic dreams, as these abilities instead went to her twin brother Harth. She believes that this makes her special, as she has not inherited any traditional Slayer fighting techniques but instead an experienced street fighter, making her unique and unpredictable. Indeed, when Buffy Summers accidentally travels to her time period, she finds it difficult to predict Melaka's moves. Melaka is also an accomplished thief.

Lander Post 5 of the Grand Army of the Republic, an American Civil War veterans organization. It has two storefronts on the ground floor, offices on the second floor, and a large meeting hall on the upper two floors. The roofline originally had ornate brick crenellations, but these were removed in the mid 20th century. The first two floors have also been altered over time, but the meeting hall remains in nearly original condition. With declining membership in the organization, the building was turned over to the city in 1919 by a Special Act of the Massachusetts Legislature. The city operates it as a museum. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The building is the earliest known work by Holman K.

The earliest part of the Gedney House was built c. 1665, and the houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. They are owned by Historic New England, which offers limited tours. Gedney House Gedney House, exterior view. Gedney House, interior view. The Gedney House is a historic Colonial American house, (First Period) estimated to have been constructed circa 1665. It is located at 21 High Street, near the intersection of Summer Street. The Gedney and Cox Houses are operated as a non-profit museum by Historic New England. The house is rarely open to the public, though private tours can be arranged. The house was built for Eleazor Gedney, a well-to-do shipwright of the Gedney family, married to the sister of John Turner, builder of Salem's House of the Seven Gables. Gedney purchased the unimproved land here in April 1664 close to the shore and the \\"buildplace\\" for his boats. He was married in June 1665, and the original portion of the house, two stories with gabled attic to the left and a parlor with lean-to roof to the right was erected at this time. Long-gone extensions at the rear (where some structural evidence survives) were probably original. They were surely in existence at the time of Eleazer's early death in 1683 when an estate inventory mentions the hall, hall chamber, a garret, \\"parlour or lento\\" and \\"lento chambr,\\" and \\"Kitchin, Loft over it & little leantoo.\\" The latter lean-to was presumably in the rear. Gedney House is built in 1665Gedney House is built in 1665 Around 1703‚Äì1706, the original parlor lean-to was raised to a full two stories. The last (and most extensive) structural changes followed about 1800, whereby a new two-story lean-to at the rear with separate chimney replaced whatever had preceded it. At this time also the framed overhang along the street was furred out and a basement kitchen introduced. Around 1962 the central chimney was removed and the interior stripped. The house was acquired by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England) in 1967. The house is significant for its structural carpentry and for surviving early paint and decorative finishes. In the hall chamber three successive color schemes can be identified, the earliest thought to be contemporary or near-contemporary with original construction. In 2002 the Oxford Dendrochronology Laboratoryhttp://www.dendrochronology.com/ analyzed timber from the original structure and ascertained that donor trees were felled at the following times: Spring 1664 and Winter 1664/5.

The building currently serves as Georgetown's Town Hall. It occupies a prominent location in the town center, and is one of its best Colonial Revival structures. The two story wood frame building was built in 1905 to a design by the Boston architectural firm of Cooper and Bailey, and located at the site of an earlier one-room schoolhouse built in the 18th century. It was Georgetown's first multi-room school building, and was built after the town's first high school/town hall burned down in 1898. Its siting, use, and construction were attended by some controversy, The building housed grades 1 through 9 until 1919, when the junior high grades were moved to Perley High School. It continued to serve as an elementary school until the 1970s, by which time modern facilities had been constructed for all grades. In 1974 the building was converted for use as town hall. The building underwent a major restoration in 1999-2000 in which its Colonial Revival details were sensitively restored. The building is situated on a rise overlooking Library and Central Streets, and is accessed by drives that flank its east and west sides. It is a nearly square building, with nine window bays on the north and south sides, and eight on the east and west elevations. Windows are located symmetrically, and the entrances are centered on the north and south elevations. The main entrance is highlighted by a pedimented porch supported by narrow columns. The hipped roof is made of slate, a replacement of the original done during the 2000 restoration. Two chimney stacks, each a long narrow brick structure, rise above the east and west sides. An elevator head house has been added to the south side of the building. The exterior walls are sheathed with clapboard, with pilastered corner trim and a plain cornice. The interior of the building has been sensitively restored to bring back details that were originally present during its period as a school (as evidenced by historic photographs) and later removed. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Advantages of dredging There are several reasons to dredge food prior to saut√©ing or frying: *The flour and other dry ingredients seal in moisture to prevent the food from becoming tough. *The coating applied to the food acts as a barrier that keeps the food from sticking to the pan as it cooks. *The coating helps to brown the food and provide a crunchy surface. *The coating enables the exterior of the food to become crisp and darken evenly without burning. *The seasoning in the coating adds flavor to the food.

V250s were delivered with a significant delay. Full commercial services with V250 started on 9 December 2012 but stopped only 39 days later on 17 January 2013, after the Belgian Railway Inspection Agency had suspended the operating license. This happened because of safety and structural problems with the construction and maintenance of V250. All were removed from service and sent back to AnsaldoBreda in Italy. In August 2017, Trenitalia purchased all 19 V250 sets to expand its high speed fleet and rebranded them as ETR700s. After being refurbished, they entered service on Frecciargento services, on the Adriatic railway, between Milan and Lecce in 2019. Seventeen sets will be used for services, with the remaining two used as sources of spares. Background and history NS International and NMBS/SNCB ordered 19 sets in 2004 for operations between Amsterdam and Brussels and Breda on the HSL-Zuid and HSL 4 high speed railway lines. Initially delivery was foreseen for 2007. In 2008 expectations were for deliveries by 2009 and an introduction into service by the middle of 2009. Front of a V250 in Italy. The first sets had been manufactured by March 2009, and initial tests on the Velim test circuit in the Czech Republic took place in early 2009, In April 2009 the first unit arrived in Arnhem in the Netherlands, and was towed to Amsterdam for tests. The NS International had claimed that the delay of introduction of any trains was due to the lack of a formal ETCS level 2 specification; by March HSA was close to financial ruin due to lack of any income, and a re-organisation of track access charges for the unused HSL-Zuid line had to be arranged with the Dutch government. The service, branded Fyra, was introduced along with the formal presentation of the prototype V250 train at the high speed train depot at Watergraafsmeer in the Netherlands on 7 July 2009. The unfurnished prototype underwent testing on both high speed lines, with the ordered trains' expected in-service date of Autumn 2010; introduction of any service on the HSL-Zuid had been delayed due to problems with the introduction of the ETCS signalling system; the line had been built without any legacy safety system. Services on the line began in September 2009 with conventional locomotive haulage, but the introduction of level 2 ETCS on the whole line was not in place, and expected by June 2010. In 2010, the Dutch transport minister Camiel Eurlings stated that any introduction of a commercial V250 service on Dutch high speed lines would not take place until December 2011. Driver training on high-speed lines in the Netherlands began in March 2012, with commercial use of the V250 planned for September 2012. A limited service of one return train per 3 hours in the Netherlands began in September 2012 between Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The trains were provisionally certified for use in Belgium in September 2012. Regular Fyra service between Amsterdam and Brussels with V250 trains began on 9 December 2012. Following their introduction, the V250 trains experienced numerous technical problems. All V250s were suspended from commercial service on 16 January 2013, after only one month of service, due to reliability and safety concerns in snowy weather. Two days later the certification for the V250 in Belgium was revoked after a floor plate that had fallen off a V250 was found along the tracks. The continuous problems with the V250 trains caused a public outcry in both Belgium and the Netherlands, including accusations in the Belgian and Dutch media that only financial considerations were behind the decision to grant the contract to AnsaldoBreda. Initially, the maximum speed requirements were fixed at 220 km/h, which would have reduced the purchase cost per seat drastically. However, after comparing offers by Alstom (manufacturers of the French TGV) and Siemens (who manufacture the German ICE trains) with that of AnsaldoBreda, it transpired that the Italian producer was able to offer a cheaper train with a higher speed of 250 km/h, which ultimately gave the Italian company the edge. On 31 May 2013, the Belgian railway company NMBS/SNCB decided to stop the Fyra project, due to the many technical issues, and safety concerns. No trains had been delivered and the company refused delivery of the trains it had ordered, on grounds that the manufacturer was unable to resolve any of the numerous issues in the contractually foreseen 3 months. Fyra V250 in service in the Netherlands On 3 June 2013, the Dutch national railway company NS announced that it had made a similar evaluation, and expressed its desire to stop with the V250 project. The Dutch department of finance agreed, and recommended that NS do \\"everything in its power\\" to get a refund from AnsaldoBreda. At a press conference on 6 June 2013, the manufacturer claimed that the trains had been handled poorly by running the trains too fast (i.e. at maximum commercial speed of 250 km/h) under snow conditions. AnsaldoBreda has also threatened to sue the railways for the damage to its reputation. On 17 March 2014, NS announced a settlement with AnsaldoBreda had been reached. The 9 NS trains would be returned to AnsaldoBreda for a refund of ‚Ç¨125 million, ‚Ç¨88m less than originally paid. NS would receive an additional compensation for each resold unit to a maximum of ‚Ç¨21m, although no units have been sold by the NS. Similarly, in May 2014 NMBS/SNCB, AnsaldoBreda and its controlling company Finmeccanica announced that they reached a settlement that confirms the cancellation of the train orders and included a payment of ‚Ç¨2.5m to NMBS/SNCB.

Upon Prof. Ward's retirement, poet Peter Makuck took over the editorship and renamed the journal, opening it to outside submissions and publishing the first issue as Tar River Poetry in November 1978, but retaining the numbering system of the earlier journal (thus the first issue with the new name was published as issue 18, number 1). The 30th Anniversary issue, published in December 2008, included an interview with Makuck. Contributors and editors Tar River Poetry has published many of the best-known American poets of the late 20th and early 21st century, including Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winners Claudia Emerson, William Stafford, Louis Simpson, Carolyn Kizer, Henry Taylor, and A.R. Ammons, and many other well-known poets including Sharon Olds, Leslie Norris, William Matthews, Albert Goldbarth, and Patricia Goedicke. *Vernon Ward (founder - 1978) *Peter Makuck (1978 - 2006) *Luke Whisnant (2006‚Äìpresent), with Carolyn Elkins Associate Editor References *Ettari, Gary. \\"The Poet and the Sea: An Interview with Peter Makuck.\\" North Carolina Literary Review Number 16 (2007): 66‚Äì74. *Smith, Leanne E. \\"ECU Poetry Forum: History.\\" http://www.ecu.edu/org/poetryforum/history.html External links *Tar River Poetry Website Category:Poetry magazines published in the United States Category:Biannual magazines published in the United States Category:East Carolina University Category:Magazines established in 1978 Category:Magazines published in North Carolina ","title":"Tar River Poetry"},{"id":"18747286","text":"Naval Air Warfare Centershttp://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcwd/command/Navy.aspx/AboutUshttp://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcad/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.about_us are research organizations within Naval Air Systems Command.

The district includes properties on Main Street, Wood and Woodbury Lanes, Newtown, Concord, and Nagog Hill Roads, and has been the town's civic heart since its establishment in the 1730s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The area that is now Acton was granted to English colonial settlers in 1643, but was not settled until 1680 as part of Concord. It was separately incorporated in 1735. The town's early civic buildings and common area were located near its geographic center, which for much of the colonial period remained a small agricultural settlement. It remained so due to the absence of water power for industrial growth, which led to the growth of West Acton and South Acton. It was also bypassed by the railroad, but remained of civic importance due to the presence of churches and civic buildings. Most of the housing stock in Acton Centre is Federal or Greek Revival in style, although there are some houses that have later Italianate and Queen Anne styling, and there are several Colonial Revival houses. The historic district extends along Main Street (Massachusetts Route 27) from the triangular common in the west to Nagog Hill in the east, and includes a few buildings on adjacent roadways. The common is the remnant of the town's original common, established in 1731, and houses the town's monument to the American Revolutionary War. It was here that the town's militia company mustered for the Battles of Lexington and Concord that sparked the conflict. The town's main civic buildings are in the district: the Congregational Church (1846, later restyled with Queen Anne details), the Town Hall (1863, Italianate), and Acton Memorial Library (1889, Romanesque Revival).

Description It is an , bronze statue of a fisherman dressed in oilskins standing braced at the wheel on the sloping deck of his ship. The monument has a square base of sea green granite. It is positioned so that the fisherman is looking out over Gloucester Harbor. The fisherman in the sculpture was modeled after Capt. Clayton Morrissey, a prominent Gloucester fisherman, once the captain of the Effie M. Morrissey.\\"The Clayton Morrissey Story ,\\" July 2, 1936, \\"Noted Skipper Dies Suddenly of Heart Attack Capt. Clayton Morrissey, Veteran of Sea and One of Greatest Fishermen of All Times, Stricken at Sea\\" (from \\"Out of Gloucester\\" at www.downtosea.com). The stone was purposely sculpted with a rough finish to make the fisherman look rugged. Craske posed the fisherman to look as if he was facing a windstorm and was headed toward dangerous rocks. His eyes are fixed on the water and sails, while every muscle is strained to hold the wheel with a firm grip. A small plaque on the north or street-facing side of the base reads, \\"Memorial To The Gloucester Fisherman, August 23, 1923\\". A larger recessed panel on the front or harbor-facing side of the base holds an inscription of bronze letters taken from the Bible's , which reads: \\"They That Go Down To The Sea In Ships 1623-1923\\". History The English sculptor Leonard Craske (1882‚Äì1950) designed the sculpture, and it was cast by the Gorham Company of Providence, Rhode Island, in 1925. According to the National Park Service: > The Gloucester Tercentenary Permanent Memorial Association sponsored an > artistic competition to commemorate Gloucester's 300th anniversary and to > permanently memorialize the thousands of fishermen lost at sea in the first > three centuries of Gloucester's history.

It is situated facing east toward salt marshes of a small tidal river. It is a 2-1/2 story timber-framed structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It has many surviving interior First Period elements, including chamfered beams and board and batten doors. The windows are reproductions; according to architectural historian Anne Grady, \\"old leading and glass found in the cellar formed the model for the new leaded glass windows\\" as part of a 1929 restoration. By tradition, Robert Goodale moved from Salem to what is now Peabody in 1669 and built the house for his son Isaac shortly thereafter. Stylistic features place the construction date closer to 1700, and it was more likely built by Isaac Goodale c. 1695. The house was moved to Ipswich by their descendant, Dr. Robert Goodale and his family in 1928, its reconstruction overseen by preservationist Eugene Dow.

Qvale was one of the key figures in the creation of the Jensen-Healey. Qvale became the first distributor for Jaguar on the Pacific West Coast. Qvale was one of the founders of the San Francisco Auto Show and the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. He was credited with the concept of the Corkscrew signature corner of Laguna Seca.Kjell Qvale - SCCA Hall of Fame Early life Kjell Qvale was born in Trondhjem, Norway, and was the son of a Norwegian sea captain. He moved to the United States in 1929. Qvale attended the University of Washington and was a U.S. Navy pilot during World War II. Car importing, dealing and manufacturing On a trip to New Orleans, Qvale saw an MG TC, an English sports car made by Morris Garages. He decided to import MG cars into the United States, believing that since he found the car so appealing other people would too. He established a business near San Francisco and diversified by adding other car brands including Austin, Morris, Jaguar, and Rolls Royce. The business traded under the name 'British Motor Car Distributors'. Later Qvale further diversified his business interests by importing non-British brands including Volkswagen (exclusive distributor of the first Volkswagens in the Western United States I Never Look Back, My Story, Qvale's autobiography), Porsche, De Tomaso, Maserati and Lamborghini. For a brief period Qvale moved into car manufacturing by acquiring a significant stake in Jensen Motors. Jensen and the Jensen-Healey By 1970, Qvale's organization was selling more than 160,000 cars in the United States. The Austin-Healey, produced by the British Motor Corporation (BMC), was popular with American buyers. BMC's announcement that it would end production of Austin-Healeys created a problem for Qvale, who stood to lose sales. It was also unwelcome news for Austin- Healey's designer Donald Healey ‚Äì who received a royalty on each Austin-Healey sold ‚Äì and for English car manufacturer, Jensen Motors, who built the Austin- Healeys for BMC. This prompted discussions between these three parties which ultimately led to a plan for the design and production of a vehicle to fill the gap the Austin-Healey would leave. In 1970 Kjell Qvale became the majority shareholder in Jensen Motors. The first production version of the Jensen- Healey was completed in 1972. Movie financing and Nico Minardos In 1974 Nico Minardos approached Qvale for a product placement deal to use a Jensen Interceptor in Assault on Agathon, a motion picture Minardos was producing and starring in along with Marianne Faithfull. By Qvale's own account, \\"Minardos must be a better salesman than I am, because he ended up convincing me to finance the entire movie.\\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1676106/ The movie‚Äîa sort of knockoff James Bond thriller‚Äîwas made, with prominent use of the Jensen car, and was distributed by MGM, but it failed dismally at the box office and Qvale wrote off his investment.https://vimeo.com/ondemand/findingnico As Qvale recounted to Minardos's godson, Owen Prell, in the 2010 documentary film, Finding Nico, \\"I have no regrets. It was a fun experience being a Hollywood producer.\\" Qvale Automotive Group Kjell Qvale's son, Bruce Qvale, founded automobile manufacturer Qvale. Qvale was an independent Italian car manufacturer founded in 2000. Qvale's sole product was the Qvale Mangusta, originally the De Tomaso Bigu√†. In 2003, Qvale sold the rights to the Mangusta to MG Rover Group. Horse racing Qvale spent a lifetime owning and racing thoroughbred racehorses. He was president of the Pacific Racing Association at Golden Gate Fields and also served as chairman of the board of Bay Meadows Racetrack. He headed the board of directors at Golden Gate Fields for 25 years (where his horses still run) and his breeding farm in the Napa Valley was the last home of the legendary Silky Sullivan. In the 1980s he campaigned his homebred Variety Road, only missing a campaign in the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing because of the horse's ill health. Variety Road's biggest win came in the 1987 Grade I San Fernando Stakes, when he nipped Broad Brush at the wire with Snow Chief and Ferdinand right behind them.Variety Road Death Kjell Qvale died at the age of 94, still racing his horses. Until the day of his death he maintained an active racing stable in Napa, California.

It was built in the Doric order around 460‚Äì450 BC, just north of the first Hera Temple. If still in use by the 4th-and 5th century, it would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. It has six columns along its shorter sides and fourteen columns along its longer sides. The columns do not have the typical 20 flutes on each column, but have 24 flutes. The Temple of Hera II also has a wider column size and smaller intervals between columns. The entasis, or curve, of its columns give a stronger visual presence. This temple is aligned with a double peaked mountain considered to be sacred by the Greeks. The name Temple of Neptune is a misnomer from the 18th century, even though it was actually dedicated to the goddess Hera. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The temple was also used to worship Zeus and another deity, whose identity is unknown. There are visible on the east side the remains of two altars, one large and one smaller. The smaller one is a Roman addition, built when a road leading to a Roman forum was cut through the larger one. It also is possible that the temple originally was dedicated to both Hera and Poseidon; some offertory statues found around the larger altar are thought to demonstrate this identification. The Temple of Hera II resembles the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. With the other temples at Paestum it is one of the best preserved early Greek temples.

The Flat Ledge Quarry was one of the largest operations, moving its stones across Granite Street to first Knowlton Pier, and then later the Granite Pier, where ships transported the stone up and down the Atlantic coast. By the 1860s the Rockport Granite Company sought means to more rapidly move the stone from the quarry to the waterfront. To this end, a deep cut was made under Granite Street. The bridge over this cut was designed by John Pratt of Quincy and built in the spring and summer of 1872. Its 65-foot span was described at the time as one of the longest in the state.

The dam has a length of and a height of . Lawrence is in Essex County, Massachusetts, approximately north of Boston and only a few miles south of the New Hampshire border (Salem), located in the Merrimack Valley. The dam is downstream from Lowell and is visible from Route 28 (Broadway) in Lawrence and from behind the Pacific Paper Mill (now defunct). The dam feeds two canals (North, re-built in 1848, and South, completed in 1896). At their peak, the North Canal provided up to 13,000 horsepower and the South Canal 2,000 horsepower; the Essex Company sold \\"mill rights\\" to its water power, allowing mills to use the energy provided. The North Canal existed before the dam, but was redeveloped both to better feed the mills and to accommodate the drop caused by the dam. About a mile in length, the canal had a guard lock and three lift locks with mitered gates. The locks were abandoned in the 1960s. Today the dam is the site of a hydroelectric plant, completed in 1981, which is owned by Enel (now parent company of the Essex Company, which still owns the dam). and the Lawrence Hydroelectric Associates.  Background  In part due to the successful use of the river's power to develop the industrial potential of the city of Lowell, a consortium of local industrialists (Abbott Lawrence, Edmund Bartlett, Thomas Hopkinson of Lowell, John Nesmith, and Daniel Saunders) set out to create a \\"New City on the Merrimack\\", which would later become known as Lawrence. Land was acquired from towns on both sides of the Merrimack River (North Andover, Andover and Methuen) 11 miles downstream from Lowell. However, water power required a fall greater than the provided by the natural river drop; to achieve a usable water height of no less than , a dam of unprecedented size would be required. Initially known as \\"The Merrimack Water Power Association\\" (1843) under Samuel Lawrence and Daniel Saunders, the association had identified that \\"there lay a tract of land resting upon foundations of imperishable blue stone and so shaped and environed by nature as to be a rare site for a permanent dam and a connected system of canals, and for the building of a manufacturing city\\"; this tract was at Bodwell's Falls.History of the City of Lawrence by Jonathan Franklin Chesley Hayes, 1868, p. 17 In 1845, Abbott Lawrence, Nathan Appleton, Patrick T. Jackson, John A. Lowell, Ignatius Sargent, William Sturgis and Charles S. Storrow incorporated as the Essex Company with a charter to develop water power for planned textile mills along the Merrimack River by building a dam at the preferred site. In addition to being a company director, Storrow was the lead engineer for the Essex Company and is credited as the designer and engineer of the dam. Previous to incorporating as the Essex Company, the group of men had been known as the \\"Boston Associates\\" and had made similar developments upstream in Lowell, where a dam of similar (but smaller) size had already been built, giving rise to that industrial city. The plans set forth by the Essex Company, for the dam and surrounding industrialization, were so popular that it took less than one month to acquire capital of 1 million dollars.  Construction  Gilmore & Carpenter won the contract to build the dam. The construction commenced and finished on the same day (September 19) three years apart (one source states it was the same hour) from the first stone laid in 1843 to the last in 1848. Charles H. Bigelow, who had been an engineer in the US Army, supervised the construction. The exact construction is outlined as follows: \\"The dam is constructed of huge granite blocks, laid in hydraulic cement firmly embedded and bolted upon the river rock bed. The thickness at the base is 35 feet, narrowed gradually to about 13 feet below the crest stone. The greatest height of masonry is 22 feet and the average plunge of water 25 to 26 feet without flashboards. The masonry, including wings extending inland, is 1,629 feet in length. The overflow of water is 900 feet wide from wing to wing, the crest line curving slightly upstream. A solid filling of earth, backing the masonry and sloping back, one foot in six, protects the structure. The south wing wall is 324 feet long and the north wing 405 feet. The original cost of the structure, at the time of building when prices of labor and material ruled low, was about $250,000.\\". The construction was innovative for the time as it used hydraulic injections of concrete into the spaces between the granite stones. This has led to the dam's reliability and durability, as despite several severe floods no repairs to the dam itself have ever been required, although repairs were made in 1894 to the wooden flashboardsSkulsi, Ken. History of Lawrence Massachusetts Vol 2. Page 53. and the flashboard system was updated in 2007 to improve water control. No repairs to the stonework have ever been needed. At the time of its construction it was the largest dam in the world, and it remains one of the significant landmarks defining the city to which its creation gave birth. It was so significant to the city at the time, a celebration was held in honor of its semi-centennial in 1895, yet now may be less celebrated, as at the site of the dam there is no viewing platform, monument or historical marker giving passersby information about the historical innovation and social marvel beneath their feet. The Lawrence History Center (located in what were the offices of the Essex Company) has significant displays on the dam and its creation. The construction of the dams and canals might have been more expensive if not for the easy availability of cheap labor, often Irish immigrants, who worked in what could be appalling and unsafe conditions which contributed to injury and sometimes death.Skulki, Ken. History of Lawrence Massachusetts, Volume 2, page 7.  Post-construction (20th century) development  Increasingly from the end of World War II, the economic, social and industrial landscapes within which the mills relied on the dam's power were changing. Complex interrelated forces including geographical migration of the textile industry and development of an increasingly influential \\"consumer economy\\" with high shopper expectations, demanding price models and rapidly evolving fashion tastes, plus the development of energy and industrial technologies, all led to widespread mill closures, making the power the dam provided obsolete for current needs while also wholly inadequate for newer development. While these and other changes reduced demand for the dam's energy, demand for hydroelectric power was growing: the Great Stone Dam was both literally and figuratively well placed to be as much a part of the future as it had been of the past if investment could be found for the necessary modernization. In the 1970s the Lawrence Hydroelectric Associates began the construction of a $28-million power plant at the south end of the Great Stone Dam that would ensure energy production and preserve the architectural integrity of the dam. In 1981, the project was completed allowing the generation of 16.8 MW of energy, far more than the 15,000 hp the dam provided in its heyday. The plant's development included a high-tech fish ladder intended to promote fish migration, especially salmon. Fish numbers in the river are higher than before, but time has shown that although the presence of a ladder is better than not having one, the dam‚Äîas do all unnatural river obstructions‚Äîhas had a detrimental impact on natural resources. Although hydroelectric power has often been billed as a sustainable green energy source, continued sustainability relies on developing better ways of supporting nature, fish habitat and fundamental ecological services. The need to work in partnership with nature and be more responsive to a changing climate led in 2007 to $3.5 million in improvements and repairs, including replacement of the old plywood flashboards with a more reliable metal and rubber-bladder washboard structure (for better flood and water level control), as well as improving fish migration.Wacker, Tim. Boston Globe. September 27, 2007 In 2008 repairs were delayed by exceptionally heavy rains which highlighted the necessity of the repairs. The development was carefully planned to ensure longevity and capacity for the 19th century achievement. It remains owned by the Essex Company which itself is now owned by Enel Green Energy, in partnership with Lawrence Hydroelectric Associates. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, the Great Stone Dam is considered one of the greatest engineering projects of the 19th century due to its size, its method and the impact of its development. It stands as testament to the heyday of great innovation and innovators, to a time of economic and social development, to the Essex Company itself, and most importantly to an immigrant city born in and of the American industrial revolution. It was further included in the North Canal Historic District in 1984.  Contribution to local recreation  Because of the impact on the depth and flow of the river, and the large mill pond caused by the dam, the area above and below the dam have enhanced recreational opportunities. A large area for sailing, kayaking and boating is located immediately upstream from the dam, supported by a large boat house housing the Greater Lawrence Community Boating Program (as well as a water rescue station). Despite conservationist concerns over fish numbers, the area immediately below the dam is a popular fishing location for breeds such as white perch, American shad, river herring, and in season, striped bass, also known as \\"stripers\\", as the area has a larger concentration of fish due to the dam and an easily accessible shoreline for both boaters and shoreside anglers.

Grainger opened an anatomical school in Webb Street, Southwark, London in 1819 after his offer to teach at Guy's Hospital was rejected. The school was successful until the College of Surgeons changed their by-laws to squeeze the independent schools. The Webb Street school was continued by Edward's brother, Richard Dugard Grainger, after Edward's early death.Adrian Desmond, The Politics of Evolution: morphology, medicine and reform in radical London (1989) Chicago, p. 160. Life Grainger was born in Birmingham and was the elder son of Edward Grainger, who was a surgeon and later the author of Medical and Surgical Remarks (1815). After receiving medical instruction from his father, he entered as a student at the united hospitals of St. Thomas's and Guy's in October 1816. He was a dresser to Sir Astley Cooper, who advised him to open an anatomical school in Birmingham after he had become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. When Charles Aston Key was appointed demonstrator of anatomy by Cooper, Grainger was anxious to be made joint demonstrator with him. Failing in that, he opened an anatomical school and dissecting-room of his own in June 1819. Grainger's school was located in the large attic of a tailor's house in St. Saviour's Churchyard, Southwark. Grainger began with 30 pupils and was successful. In the autumn of 1819, he moved to a location close to Guy's in Webb Street, Maze Pond, in a building had been used as a Roman Catholic chapel. Grainger's school had the favour of the resurrection men, speedily rivalled the hospital schools, and drew pupils from them. In 1821 he built a theatre in Webb Street and was joined by John Armstrong and Richard Phillips. Despite obstacles put in the way of the students by hospital surgeons in London, especially the council of the Royal College of Surgeons, Grainger's school grew. In 1823 he built a larger theatre, and the school had nearly 300 pupils. Grainger died from consumption at his father's house in Birmingham, on 13 January 1824, having not quite completed his twenty-seventh year.

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Hale Boynton House is located in Newbury's Byfield area, on the west side of Middle Street north of Elm Street. It is surrounded by more modern buildings that make up part of the campus of The Governor's Academy, a private boarding school founded in 1763. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, built of timber frame construction, with a side gable roof, two interior brick chimneys, and an exterior finished on the front and rear in clapboards, and on the sides in wooden shingles. The front facade is five bays wide, with the entrance at the center, flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. The interior has an unusual floor plan for the period, with five rooms arrayed around the chimneys. Many original features remain, including raised wooden paneling on the walls and fireplace surrounds, and iron hooks used in cooking. The house was built in 1764 for Joseph Hale, whose family had owned the land since 1733, operating a tavern that served travelers at the nearby river crossing. Hale and later his son both served as trustees of the academy after its founding, and boarded some of its students here, most notably Admiral Edward Preble. In 1898 the house was acquired by E. Moody Boynton, who was born in Ohio but whose family had deep roots in Byfield. Boynton was an eccentric inventor who became wealthy by patenting the M-shaped sawtooth, but may be best remembered for the Boynton Bicycle Railroad, a type of steam-powered monorail. The house and land were conveyed to the academy by Boynton's widow, and it continues to be used as housing.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The town of Hamilton was originally a part of Ipswich, with the first documented settlement in the area in 1638, and Bay Road (now Massachusetts Route 1A) laid out in 1640. It was established as a separate parish in 1714 and incorporated in 1793. The parish center, at the junction of Bay and Cutler Roads, became the town center, with the meeting house, cemetery, and village green all early features. The site of the meeting house is now occupied by the Greek Revival First Congregational Church, which performs the same religious function. Hamilton's 1898 Colonial Revival Town Hall also stands in the district. The district has been relatively little altered since the mid-19th century, as evidenced by maps of that and later periods. The historic district extends along Bay Road, from its junction with Cutler Road in the north to Orchard Road in the south. Twenty of its primary buildings are residences, with a few early 18th-century Georgian houses and a larger number of 19th-century Greek Revival houses. The oldest house, a saltbox built c. 1700, stands at 638 Bay Road. Besides the church and town hall, the other non-residential buildings include the village store (c. 1840), and a cobbler's shop that has been converted to residential use. All of the buildings are of frame construction, and almost all are finished in clapboards; one of the most recently built houses (1900) is finished in stucco.

Built about 1720 with plank frame construction, it is a relatively rare example of that form in the region. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Joseph Hardy House stands in a rural residential area of eastern Groveland, on the west side of King Street south of its junction with Outlook Drive. It is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior, set back from the road and facing south. The rear roofline descends to the first floor, giving the house a classic New England saltbox profile. Its main facade is five bays wide, with small second-floor windows set close to the eave, and taller 20th-century windows on the ground floor, flanking the central entrance. The interior follows a typical center-chimney plan, with a narrow vestibule in front of the chimney and chambers to either side. The rooms have exposed beams in the First Period style, with evidence of plank framing the woodwork surrounding the chimney. According to local history, the house was built about 1720 by Joseph Hardy, which is supported by analysis of the construction techniques used. It is an relatively infrequent instance of plank frame construction which is not usually found in the region. One half of the saltbox leanto section was added sometime later in the 18th century; the other was added early in the 20th century. The house remained in the hands of Hardy's descendants into the mid-19th century.

The seven story brick building was built in stages between 1906 and 1908 by the Haverhill Board of Trade, a consortium of local businessmen. The purposes of the building was to provide affordable factory space to small business operators, principally in the shoe manufacturing business that dominated Haverhill's economy in the early 20th century. The building also marked an expansion of Haverhill's business and industrial district into a previously residential area. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. It is been converted to residential use. Description and history The Haverhill Board of Trade Building is set on the south side of Walnut Street, a short way north of Washington Street, Haverhill's main downtown thoroughfare. It occupies most of the block between Emerson and Locust Streets, abutting properties that front on them. It is a large U-shaped brick structure, with the open end of the U facing south, and an extended facade facing Walnut Street. This facade, 25 bays wide, also has the only significant architectural ornamentation. Its principal features are its two entrance bays, each located four bays in from the ends. Both have round-arch openings with brick piers and dentil courses around the arch. Although most of the building is red brick, the end bays are in a buff color, and there is a dentillated band of brickwork in buff between the second and third floors across the front. The conception and construction of this building in 1906-08 represented a shift in the local approach to industrial development. Haverhill was by that time one of the nation's leading producers of footwear, and the city's economic leaders had formed a local Board of Trade in 1901 to stimulate economic activity. The stated objective in construction of this building was to provide facilities that would act as a business incubator, allowing small businesses to develop. It also marked a significant expansion of the city's industrial facilities away from Washington and Essex Streets, where they were then concentrated. After its construction (in which the three legs of the U were built separately, as land was acquired for them), the building rapidly filled up with relatively small shoe-manufacturing operations and companies that serviced them. Competition in the shoe industry stiffened in the 1930s, and other industries began to move in. The Board of Trade sold the building's three parts to separate owners in 1944-45. Shoe-related businesses continued to occupy at least parts of the building until 1969. It eventually became the headquarters and principal show room of Cabot Furniture, which owned two of the three parcels until 2004. At that time all three parts of the building were reunited under single ownership. The building has since been converted into residential units.

The district, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, has at its core a Federal style farmhouse that was donated (along with the surrounding parcel of land) to the society in 1903. It includes about of land between John Ward Avenue and the Merrimack River, on which stand four buildings; there is also an archeological site, the remains of a late 17th-century homesite, on the property. The colonial history of the property begins in the 1660s, when it was the home of Elizabeth Ward and Nathaniel Saltonstall, grandson of early Massachusetts settler Richard Saltonstall, and one of the judges of the Salem witch trials. The Saltonstall family held the property in the late 18th century, when a parcel with the house on it was taken by mortgage foreclosure by George Watson, brother-in-law to Richard Saltonstall. The property was sold by Watson's heirs to James Duncan, Sr., and it either he or his son Samuel who built the brick Federal style house known as Buttonwoods that now stands on the property. The old Saltonstall house was demolished around this time. Sometime in the early-to-mid 19th century a second house was built on the property, which was generally occupied by the farmer who managed the land. This house, known as the \\"Ward\\" house, was relocated to Eastern Avenue, sometime between 1880 and 1891. The main house and surrounding farmlands remained in the Duncan family until 1888, when heirs began subdividing and selling the farmland. The house remained in Elizabeth Duncan's ownership until she gave it to the Haverhill Historical Society in 1903. The historical society acquired the property in part to house its growing collection of papers and artifacts, and the eastern two rooms of the house were adapted as a firesafe vault for those materials. The rest of the house was first occupied by the society's curator, who redecorated the house and used it to display his personal collection. In 1906 the \\"Ward\\" house was returned to the property, at a site believed to be near its original location. This is house is used by the historical society for interpretive displays. In the 1920s the society acquired a chapel building on the north side of John Ward Avenue, which it renamed Tenney Hall. This building was to the main parcel in the 1980s, after the society sold the land it was on to Linwood Cemetery. The last main contribution to the property is a historic 1860s ten footer (a small shoe manufacturing building), added to the property in 1957.

Pittsburgh Pirates  Up until 1952 the Pirates had an on again, off again relationship with San Bernardino, California as the site of their spring training. In 1953, the team had a dismal camp in Havana, Cuba. The Pirates were looking for a long term location for their spring home. Branch Rickey, the Pirates General Manager, visited several prospective spring training locations for 1954. The finalists were Ocala, Fort Myers and Fort Pierce. Once the Pirates settled on Fort Pierce for their 1954 Spring Training location, Jaycee Field was configured with big-league dimensions: 333 feet from home plate to left field, 400 feet to center and 330 feet to right field. After installing bleachers from an adjacent football field, seating capacity was increased to 5,000. The city also agreed to install a practice infield and to expand the clubhouses. The Pirates were a special business rate to stay at the Shamrock Village, a former Navy training base that had been converted at a cost of $1.5 million into 150 efficiency apartments and 44 motel rooms.

She earned her undergraduate degree in political science from Stanford University in 1937. During World War II, she served as a Red Cross volunteer. After the war, she traveled across Europe, an experience she documented in a series of letters to the Los Angeles Times. After returning to the U.S., she earned a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles.  Professional life  Eisner conducted psychotherapy research, first with Sidney Cohen at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital Veterans Administration Center in Los Angeles and, later, from her private practice in Los Angeles. Eisner authored a book, \\"The Unused Potential of Marriage and Sex\\", which was published in 1970.Eisner, Betty Grover The Unused Potential of Marriage and Sex, Published by Little, Brown, 1970, 243 pages She also helped found The School for Learning, which taught English in Mexico. In the 1990s, she maintained a private practice in Santa Monica, California, occasionally publishing articles on psychotherapy and serving on the board of advisors for the Albert Hofmann Foundation.

She conducted early research into the use of LSD to treat alcoholism and maintained an active interest in hallucinogens throughout her career. Along with Sidney Cohen, Eisner appears to have originated the practice of using simultaneous male and female therapists or researchers during human hallucinogen administration.Eisner BG, Cohen S. ‚ÄúPsychotherapy with lysergic acid diethylamide‚Äù.

In addition to using hallucinogens like LSD and mescaline in psychedelic therapy, Eisner also gave stimulants such as methylphenidate and the inhaled gas mixture carbogen to her patients. However, Eisner's interest in finding new tools for psychotherapy was not limited to drugs. Eisner was particularly focused on extra-pharmacological variables that she felt influenced outcome of psychotherapeutic sessions. She considered the specific individuals present as an important variable in therapeutic outcome and sometimes conducted sessions in group settings. Some of these group sessions included \\"encounter group\\"-style expression and body work. Eisner also described the psychotherapeutic importance of a variable she called 'matrix.' This term encompassed the everyday living space and larger social context in which the patient lived and returned to between sessions.Eisner, BG. ‚ÄúSet, Setting and Matrix‚Äù.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Hickey-Osborne Block occupies a long portion of a city block on the north side of Main Street east of Peabody Square in downtown Peabody, opposite its junction with Park Street. The building has five groundfloor storefronts, reflective of the history of its construction. The upper levels consist of three wood-frame houses, each 2-1/2 stories in height, thus giving the building as a whole a height of 3-1/2 stories. In the gaps between these houses are stylistically linked single-story flat-roof wood frame commercial elements. The oldest portion of the block is the easternmost house, built about 1797 for John Upton, while the other two houses date to about 1835. All have five-bay facades in the Federal style, although the middle house has had its center bays replaced by a two-story bay window structure. The Upton House was raised on 1897 by S. Osborne, and its ground floor was remodeled in the 1960s to match the other elements of the building. The houses of Daniel Dodge and Ebenezer Sprague Upton were raised in 1923. At that time, the infill sections between the buildings were also added.

It encompasses the oldest section of High Street, which was laid out when Ipswich was founded in 1633. The district runs for four blocks from the junction with Town Farm Road and the railroad right- of-way in the west, to North Main Street in the east. The street was for several centuries part of the principal thoroughfare through the town, but became sidelined by the construction of Central Street in 1871, which bypassed traffic off most of this stretch of High Street. Ipswich was from its earliest days an important transit stop, and High Street was the location of its inns for travelers. It was also where courts met when judges rode the circuit. In the 18th century small industrial shops also populated the street, and some of these led to the building of larger textile firms elsewhere. When Central Street was built just south of High Street, the street began to acquire a more distinctly residential character, which it retains to this day. The district contains more than thirty structures built before 1750, many of which retain First Period and Georgian styling. Some of the more interesting houses include that of John Caldwell, built c. 1660 on the site of Governor Simon Bradstreet's original 1630s house, the c. 1770s town jail, which was converted into a Greek Revival house in the 19th century, and the c. 1727 house of Reverend Nathaniel Rogers.

Tradition holds that he was a bishop of Helvia Ricina (Macerata), during the 3rd century, martyred on November 24. His cult is ancient and widespread in the Marche and Umbria, with many churches and abbeys dedicated to him, but historical information on his life is limited to a few details and traditions. He is sometimes identified with Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople. Veneration Recanati Cathedral, dedicated to San Flaviano (1804) One of Flavian's successors in the see of Ricina, Saint Claudius (4th century), fixed the date of Flavian's feast day and also built and dedicated a church to him. Ricina was destroyed by the Goths during the 5th and 6th centuries, and its inhabitants emigrated to Recanati, thus spreading Flavian's cult. Other groups of refugees carried the relics of the saint in the direction of Tolentino, erecting an oratory in honor of Flavian, on a site that may have been associated with a pagan deity. On the site of this oratory, the Benedictine Rambona Abbey still preserves Flavian's relics. The sarcophagus purported to carry his relics actually dates from the 4th century and as Antonio Borelli points out, this fact casts doubt on the authenticity of Flavian's relics, which were carried there ‚Äì at least according to the tradition - two centuries later. One explanation is that the relics were not carried there at all, but were already at Rambona when the inhabitants of Ricina arrived there, or that they belonged to a different saint: Saint Amicus (Amico), abbot of Rambona. The cult of Saint Flavian in Recanati nearly died out in the 15th century before reviving once again after a plague hit the city in 1483; a procession in honor of the saint was held in that year and Father Bonfini, a scholar from Ascoli Piceno, wrote a panegyric in honor of the saint, in November 1483.

Early life Barney was born in Henderson, Jefferson County, New York and graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York, in 1834. Career In 1830, he served as chairman of the executive committee of the Young Men's Anti-Slavery Society in New York City. He was associated with John Jay, A.C. Coxe, Theodore Weld, and Henry Stanton. In 1840, he formed a law partnership with William Mitchell in New York City. The firm was later continued under the name of Barney, Humphrey, and Butler. Mitchell died suddenly and in March 1849 Barney became associated with Benjamin Franklin Butler and his son William Allen Butler. Political career In 1840, he was nominated for the United States Congress by the Anti-Slavery Party. He was a presidential elector when the Free Soil Party was formed in 1848. Barney was a delegate to the Republican National Convention of 1856, which nominated John C. Fremont. He voted for Charles Sumner rather than Fremont while he was there. He attended the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Illinois in 1860. Barney met with Lincoln at Springfield, Illinois shortly after the convention ended. Barney raised $35,000 in New York, which he sent to the Illinois State Committee. Lincoln called upon Barney at a hotel in Springfield when he was sent by Republicans of New York to consult with Lincoln regarding his Cabinet. Lincoln requested that Barney write out a list in pencil of his choices for Cabinet posts. He chose Caleb Smith as Secretary of the Interior and Simon Cameron as Secretary of War, rather than men Barney had recommended. Barney was Collector during the first three years of the administration of Abraham Lincoln. He resigned and refused an appointment to a foreign mission. Personal life His first wife, Susannah Tappan, was the daughter of the abolitionist Lewis Tappan. They had six children. One of their sons, Lewis Tappan Barney, became a highly decorated officer during the American Civil War. Barney married his second wife, Harriet E. Kilburne, in 1880.

The light was constructed in 1873 on Bayley's Wharf, a short way west of its present location, along with the rear range light, which stands near Water Street. The light was converted from coal-based power to electricity in 1933, and automated in 1952. In about 1961 a hexagonal extension was built to increase the tower's height; this has since been removed.

It extends from the green northward on High Street to the town line with Newburyport. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The town of Newbury was incorporated in 1635, with a town center originally further along the Parker River. The present upper green was laid out in 1642 as a militia training ground, and became the new center of the town (which then included both Newburyport and West Newbury). The first meetinghouse was built in 1646 on a site at the green's northwest corner, where subsequent churches stood until the present 1869 First Parish Church was built across High Road. The First Parish Cemetery was also laid out in 1646, and is where many of Newbury's early settlers are buried. The green was used as an encampment side during the American Revolutionary War by forces under the command of Benedict Arnold, en route to Quebec in 1775. The historic district is bounded on the south by the upper green, and the buildings that face it on High Road, Green Street, and Hanover Street. It then extends northward along High Road to the present town line with Newburyport (separated from Newbury in 1764). Most of the buildings in the district are residential wood frame structures.

The commercial downtown area is east of US 1 and near the river, with predominantly residential areas to the west, east and south. The historic district is dominated by Federal period architecture in both its residential and commercial areas, owing to the city's principal period of prosperity, which came to an end with the advent of the War of 1812, which disrupted the trading activities of its seafaring merchants. It includes a number of properties previously listed on the National Register, including the former US Custom House (now a museum), the main post office, and the National Historic Landmark Caleb Cushing House. A particularly fine series of Federal mansions are to be found on High Street. It also has a substantial amount of residential architecture of the later 19th century, although this tends to be more vernacular in style, as it accompanied the rise of a lower industrial working class in the community.

This planet was found by the transit method using the XO Telescope and announced in May 2008. It was also independently discovered by the HATNet Project. The planet has a mass and radius just slightly larger than that of Jupiter. This planet orbits very close to the G-type parent star, as it is typical for transiting planets, classing this as Hot Jupiter. It takes only 4.188 days (or 100.5 hours) to orbit at an orbital distance of 0.0488 AU). The planet XO-5b is named Makropulos. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by the Czech Republic, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Makropulos is the name from Karel ƒåapek's play Vƒõc Makropulos (The Makropulos Affair). Discovery XO-5b was the fifth hot Jupiter transiting planet discovered by the XO Project and was identified as a possible candidate extrasolar planet from two seasons of observations, November 2003 to March 2004 and November 2004 to March 2005. Follow-up photometry was provided by the extended team, a collaboration of professional and amateur astronomers. The team obtained better quality light curves to guide the photometric and spectroscopic follow-up necessary to classify a candidate as an actual planetary companion. To confirm XO-5b's planetary nature radial velocity observations of XO-5 were made with the high resolution spectrograph on the 11 meter Hobby‚ÄìEberly Telescope located at McDonald Observatory, in order to measure the mass of the planet. Commencing on December 7, 2007 a total of ten radial velocity measurements were made which confirmed XO-5b's status as a planet.

The road runs from the Lynn Rotary, its junction with Lynn Shore Drive and the Lynnway, about to Wilson Road in Nahant. It passes through Nahant Beach Reservation, a state park offering beach access on the isthmus. The road offers expansive views of the area coastlines and Boston Harbor. Both the park and the roadway are administered by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. Nahant Beach Boulevard was first laid out in 1905, as part of the Metropolitan District Commission's program of developing oceanfront parkways, and provided the first paved road access to Nahant. It was designed by the firm of Olmsted, Olmsted, and Eliot, predecessor to the Olmsted Brothers landscape design firm. Around the same time, rail access and a bridle path were also added to the isthmus. In 1936 that roadway alignment was converted into a parking area, and the present roadway was completed the following year on the alignment of the railroad bed. The Lynn Rotary was completed in 1935. This work, along with the conversion of the bridle path to a promenade, was paid for by Works Progress Administration grants. Since then modifications to the roadway have been modest. Seawalls have been built, a chain link fence was installed on the wall between the road and the parking lot, and the rotary was landscaped. When the roadway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, the designation included, in addition to the roadway itself, the Lynn Rotary and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Memorial located in the rotary; a second memorial, the Aliferis Monument, postdates the period of significance for the listing.

The three story brick building was built in 1895 on the site of a former town green, and forms part of Andover's central Elm Square intersection. The building exhibits Romanesque Revival styling, featuring granite trim elements and ornate brick detailing. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Early 20th century postcard of the Musgrove Block. The storefront at lower left served as a waiting room and transfer station for local trolley lines. The Musgrove Block occupies most of a roughly trapezoidal lot on the east side of Elm Square, the six-way road intersection at the heart of downtown Andover. It is a three-story red brick building, with commercial storefronts in the ground level, and office space on the upper floors. The building presents a broad facade to the intersection, with a small plaza in front. This facade is 15 bays wide, with six storefronts and a building entrance. To its left is a facade facing Elm Street that has three bays on the upper levels, and two commercial bays on the ground floor. To the right of the main facade is a flatiron-style rounded corner of a single bay, leading to more service oriented sides of the building facing Post Office Avenue to the south and east. The ground floor store fronts are all plate glass with a band of signage above, with entrances that are recessed; the flatiron corner also has a store entrance. The main entrance to the upper floors is set in a rounded-arch opening, with transomed rectangular second floor windows and round-arched third floor windows. The windows of the upper floors are grouped into recessed panels with brick corbelling at the top, and are set in vertical pairs within tall keystoned arches. A band of corbelling serves as a cornice below the flat roof. Prior to 1894, the area east of Elm Square was taken up by a town green and a hostelry variously known as the Eagle Hotel and the Elm Tavern. This property was purchased by John Field in 1894, and the tavern was razed. The present building was then erected on the former green, over community objections seeking its preservation as open space. The building's early occupants included a druggist who operated an ice cream counter, and a bicycle shop.

The eastern section, also three bays wide and one room deep, was added in the late 17th or early 18th century. The western portion originally had an overhanging section of the second floor; this was altered in the early 18th century, when the roof was raised to a flatter pitch and the overhanging section was concealed by construction of a flush wall. The two parts of the house were under separate ownership from 1759 until the mid-19th century. As a result, each section has its own staircase, one of them fashioned with Second Period (mid-18th century) turned woodwork.

The district includes properties on Munroe Street between Market and Washington Streets, which was spared by the 1889 fire that destroyed much of Lynn's downtown area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history Munroe Street is located in downtown Lynn, just west of its Central Square area. It parallels the railroad tracks of the MBTA commuter rail, whose station is located on the opposite side of the tracks to the south. Munroe Street is one block long, extending from Market Street in the west to Washington Street in the east. There are 23 buildings lining the street, which are all of an industrial or commercial character. Most are between two and four stories in height, and of brick construction. Most were built between about 1870 and 1890, although instances of older and newer construction also appear. The buildings are stylistically diverse, and are typically in vernacular styles popular at the time of construction. The city of Lynn was first settled in 1629, with significant development not occurring on what is now Munroe Street until the 19th century. The railroad line that Munroe parallels was laid out in 1840, and Market Street was from an earlier date a crossing point for a nearby stream. Munroe Street became an early nexus for Lynn's nascent shoe industry after the railroad arrived, gradually expanding businesses developing their due to the convenient rail access. Although there were at the time some residences on the street, by the late 19th century they had all been replaced by shoe factories. The area is notable for surviving the city's Great Fire of 1889, which raged to the east and destroyed significant portions of the downtown area. As a result, the street's architecture provides one of the best windows into the early history of its historically significant shoe industry.

It now houses offices of the city's water department. Description and history The former Methuen Water Works building is located in northwestern Methuen, on the west side of Cross Street near its crossing of Harris Brook. It is a single-story masonry structure, built out of red brick with a slate hip roof. At the center is a circular wooden cupola, which is clad in wooden shingles and topped by a conical roof. The main facade is three bays wide, with two large round-arch openings flanking the center entrance. A course of rusticated stone extends between the window bays and acts as a lintel for the entrance. To the right of the main block is a projecting hyphen that ends in a small circular brick structure, also capped by a conical roof. The interior originally housed a boiler in one chamber and steam-powered pump engine in another. The town established a water board in 1893, which in September of that year approved construction of this building. It was designed by Elbridge Boyden, whose credits include water works facilities in a number of other Massachusetts communities. It was largely complete later that year, built by Peabody and Pike of Lawrence. The pump in the facility was used to pump water from Harris Brook to a reservoir on Foster's Hill at .

It reintegrates its residents into mainstream society by operating various businesses, such as restaurants, catering, and moving companies, that are wholly managed and run by the residents themselves. The foundation's methods have been widely praised and have been emulated internationally.  History  John Maher, founder of the Delancey Street Foundation. Pacific Heights, San Francisco~1973 In 1971, the Delancey Street Foundation began in a San Francisco apartment. The apartment had been rented by John Maher, a self-described \\"bum\\" and \\"ex-junkie,\\" who used the apartment to shelter and friends who were quitting drugs and alcohol. The apartment soon became filled with people, so the group decided to pool together funds and start an organization. The original organization name was Ellis Island, but they eventually chose Delancey Street. It was named after Delancey Street in the Lower East Side of New York City, a settling place for immigrants at the turn of the 20th century. (excerpt: A Process of Mutual Restitution by MiMi Silbert Maher explained, \\"We wanted to get back to the concept of a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics who came over here to build a New Jerusalem and not ask Uncle Nixon for another handout.\\" Maher was a former member of drug rehabilitation program, Synanon, where he had sobered up in the 1960s. He founded the Delancey Street Foundation with three friends from Synanon, and the help of attorney Mike Berger. Maher once said, \\"I could either be a bum or a great social leader. I failed as a bum, so I had no options.\\" The project drew inspiration and methods from Synanon, from which Maher had parted ways after realizing that members were not expected to ever leave. Maher could not acquire a loan from a bank. For this reason, he borrowed one thousand dollars from a loan shark for startup funds. The first location was in a Bush Street apartment, but Maher eventually raised enough money to rent the Egyptian Consulate building in the affluent Pacific Heights neighborhood. When neighbors discovered there was a re-educational environment in the neighborhood, several formed a committee to have Delancey Street evicted. Within a year of its founding, the Delancey Street community had grown to 100 members. Maher met Mimi Silbert, a Boston-bred criminologist and psychologist from UC Berkeley. Silbert began helping Maher structure the foundation. Maher and Silbert also became romantically involved. In 1974, Delancey Street was instrumental in gaining the release from prison of Wesley Robert Wells. Wells went into the prison system at 19 years of age. By 1974, he had been incarcerated for 46 years, longer than anyone in California. Seven of those years were on Death Row in San Quentin State Prison. The campaign slogan was, \\"46 Years is Enough.\\" Wells was paroled into the custody of Delancey Street, where he became a resident, and died a year later of natural causes. In the 1970s, Maher and the foundation became closely linked with Cesar Chavez and his organization, the United Farm Workers. In 1975, Delancey residents worked as part of Cesar Chavez's personal security team, marching in the \\"Thousand Mile March\\", culminating in the Farm Workers' convention, where Maher gave a speech. Maher became friends with one of San Francisco's renowned artists, Dugald Stermer, art director for Ramparts magazine. Dugald became a print media advisor and eventually a councilor, and moved his studio to Delancey Street's Embarcadero Triangle complex. Dugald was involved until his death in 2012. Another Bay Area notable, KSAN-FM radio jock Stefan Ponek, joined Delancey's board of directors. Bill Maher, John's younger brother, who was a resident, graduated from law school, ran for and won the presidency of San Francisco's school board, and then was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. During the latter half of the 1970s, Delancey Street acquired an old \\"dude ranch\\" in New Mexico, and over the past 40 years has opened facilities in New York, Southern California, North and South Carolina, and Massachusetts. Between 1989 and 1990, the Embarcadero Triangle, a mixed use development with commercial space and 177 apartments on the San Francisco waterfront, was built by Delancey Street members. By 2002, there were 500 residents.Jane Gross, ‚ÄúSan Francisco Journal: Where Life's 'Losers' Are Building New Lives‚Äù, New York Times, March 1, 1989 In 1985, Maher left Delancey Street due to personal problems, including an arrest for drunk driving, and Silbert took over running the foundation. Over the years, she has received numerous awards for her foundation work. As of January 2015, Mimi Silbert and six residents from the early 1970s, Abe Irizarry, Jack Behan, Tommy Grapshi, Stephanie Muller, Jerry Raymond and Teri Lynch Delane, have remained to help run the Foundation.  Constituents  The average Delancey Street resident has had 12 years of drug addiction, has been in prison four times, is functionally illiterate, unskilled and has never worked for more than six months. \\"People who have become involved with gangs, drugs, violence, crime . . . those are our favorite residents,\\" Silbert said in 1993.  Rehabilitation model  Silbert refers to Delancey Street's approach as mutual restitution: \\"The residents gain the vocational, personal, interpersonal and social skills necessary to make restitution to the society from which they have taken illegally, consistently and often brutally, for most of their lives. In return Delancey Street demands from society access to the legitimate opportunities from which the majority of residents have been blocked for most of their lives.\\" The model integrates three areas of development: # Academic instruction: residents earn a high school equivalency degree (GED), and then may pursue higher education, including through an in-house Bachelor of Arts program. # Vocational training: residents learn three vocational skills, one manual, one clerical/computer and one interpersonal/sales. # Social training: residents help others in the community through various volunteer activities. The model is educational rather than therapeutic, and functions as an extended family rather than a program. The central \\"each-one-teach-one\\" principle has residents teaching other residents, there is no professional staff. Traditional family values stress work ethic, mutual restitution, social and personal accountability and responsibility, decency and integrity. Economic self-sufficiency and social entrepreneuralism are cornerstones. One project developed under this model is Delancey Street's headquarters, the Embarcadero Triangle, a $50 million, 400,000 square foot multi-use development, covering an entire city block on the San Francisco waterfront, completed in 1990. Silbert was the developer, Delancey Street the general contractor, and some 300 largely unskilled residents handled construction, learning on the job. The four-storey complex includes retail stores, a restaurant, a screening room, a caf√© bookstore and art gallery, and housing units for 500. The minimum stay at Delancey Street is two years, while the average resident remains for almost four years. Any act of violence, or threat of violence, is cause for immediate removal from the program. Residents learn to work together, promoting non- violence, with each new resident responsible for helping guide the next arrival. There is a complete ban on alcohol, drugs and threatening behavior. In 1998, Delancey Street launched the Life Learning Academy, a San Francisco Unified School District charter high school, \\"committed to creating a nonviolent community for students who have not been successful in traditional school settings\\". School capacity is about 50 students, with small classes of, typically, six to eight students. In 2018, construction was begun on a 6,000 square foot dormitory, to accommodate up to 20 live-in students, with free room and board. In spring 2000, through San Francisco State University, a cohort of Delancey Street students embarked on an innovative program, with several earning a BA in Urban Studies in 2004. Classes were taught on-site by volunteering university professors and community leaders. The curriculum was the same as for regular on-campus students, while courses were offered free of charge.Tanya Schevitz, ‚ÄúRising from the ashes: Recovered addicts earn college degrees‚Äù, San Francisco Chronicle, June 10, 2004 As of 2020, there were over 23,000 graduates of the program.  Residential communities  Delancey Street operates six residential education communities in the US, located in San Francisco (headquarters), Los Angeles, San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico, Brewster, New York, Greensboro, North Carolina, and North Charleston, South Carolina, and an arts training facility for program graduates, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.  Businesses  Delancey Street creates and runs business enterprises that serve as training schools and generate operating revenue. Since 1972, these companies include catering and event planning, restaurant, caf√©, bookstore & art gallery, corporate private car service, digital print shop, handcrafted furniture, ironworks, plants & glass, ceramics, landscaping, moving and trucking, paratransit van & bus services, screening room, specialty advertising sales, and Christmas tree sales and decorating. Delancey Street is also chartered as a federally-insured credit union. From its inception, Delancey Street has been financially self-sustaining, and does not accept government funding. As of 2003, about half of the $15 million annual operating costs came from business income, supplemented by donations.‚ÄúSan Francisco Foundation To Help Set Up Program For Ex-Offenders‚Äù , Chattanoogan.com, February 24, 2003 As of that year, more than 10,000 ex-cons and the homeless had been provided with housing, food, and a job at one of the many businesses the foundation operated.Jeremiah A.

The conflict is also associated with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), which serves as the political wing of the CPP. It is the world's oldest existing Communist insurgency, and is the largest, most prominent communist conflict in the Philippines, in contrast to the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist RPMP-RPA-ABB rebellion, and the now-defunct Hukbalahap and Cordillera People's Liberation Army Rebellions. Between 1969 and 2008, more than 43,000 insurgency-related fatalities were recorded. The history of the CPP‚ÄìNPA‚ÄìNDF rebellion can be traced back to March 29, 1969, when Jose Maria Sison's newly-formed Communist Party of the Philippines entered an alliance with a small armed group led Bernabe Buscayno. Buscayno's group, which was originally a unit under the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist 1930s-era Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP-1930), was renamed the \\"New People‚Äôs Army\\" (NPA) and became the armed wing of the CPP. Less than two years later, President Ferdinand Marcos introduced martial law, leading to the radicalization of many young people and a rapid growth of the CPP-NPA. In 1992, the NPA split into two factions: the reaffirmist faction led by Sison and the rejectionist faction which advocated the formation of larger military units and urban insurgencies. 13 smaller factions eventually emerged from the group. Until 2002, the NPA received a considerable amount of aid from outside the Philippines, although later developments forced it to rely more on support from local sources. Background= Formation of the Communist Party of the Philippines  The original Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 (Communist Party of the Philippines) was established in 1930 by members of the Partido Obrero de Filipinas and the Socialist Party of the Philippines with the help of the COMINTERN. It would later lead an anti-Japanese Hukbalahap Rebellion in 1942 with the Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon. During World War II, these communist guerrillas fought against both the Japanese and other guerrilla bands. In the years following, Maoist factions began organizing mass organizations such as Kabataang Makabayan, Malayang Kilusan ng Kababaihan and hosting theoretical studies on Marxism‚ÄìLeninism‚ÄìMaoism. They would eventually break off from the old party and form the Communist Party of the Philippines/Marxist‚ÄìLeninist‚ÄìMaoist in 1968.  Founding of the New People's Army  The New People's Army would be established by Jose Maria Sison and Bernabe Buscayno as the armed wing of the CPP-MLM. The new Maoist leadership would drop the reformist ideas that led the CPP-1930 to collaborate with the government of Ferdinand Marcos, and enforce Maoist principles, aimed at creating a socialist state through New Democracy by launching a people's war. Its initial strength was estimated to compromise approximately 60 guerrillas and 35 weapons.  Establishment of the National Democratic Front  The National Democratic Front was established in 1973 as the political front of the CPP-MLM, bringing together broad revolutionary organizations which accepted their 12-point program, and building international relations with foreign communist parties such as the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). Insurgency= Formative years  Initial strength and tactics = When Buscayno's forces became the NPA in 1969, they were reported to have only 60 guerrillas and 35 WWII-era guns.Francisco Nemenzo, Rectification Process in the Philippine Communist Movement,\\" in Lim Joo Jock and S. Vani, eds., Armed Communist Movements in Southeast Asia (Hampshire, England: Gower, 1984) p. 90 At first, the NPA tried to follow the Maoist military doctrine of \\"establishing stable base areas.\\" But this was abandoned when their forces took heavy casualties in Northern Luzon, in favor of dispersing their forces.Rocamora, Joel. \\"The Rural Resistance.\\" Southeast Asia Chronicle. No. 62. June‚ÄìJuly 1978, P. 14 Eventually the NPA's stockpile of weaponry allegedly soon grew to 60 guns, but all 60 of these guns were lost in an encounter the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and they were not able to regain firepower until the defection of Lt. Victor Corpus and the December 29, 1970 PMA Armory Raid. Even on September 23, 1972 when Martial Law was announced, the Philippine National Security Council didn't see the NPA as a big threat. Just a few days earlier on September 19, 1972, the Council's threat assessment was \\"between 'normal' and 'Internal Defense Condition 1',\\" where the highest condition \\"3.\\" One of the generals serving under General Fabian Ver of the National Intelligence and Security Authority later recalled that \\"Even when Martial Law was declared, the communists were not a real threat. The military could handle them.\\" = Mythologization by the Marcos administration = Despite the small size of the NPA at the time, the Marcos administration hyped up its formation, supposedly because this would help build up political and monetary support from the US, which was caught up in red scare paranoia at the time. As a result, as security specialist Richard J. Kessler notes, the administration \\"mythologized the group, investing it with a revolutionary aura that only attracted more supporters.\\" = December 1970 PMA Armory Raid = The NPA was finally able to regain weaponry on December 29, 1970, when Philippine Military Academy instructor Lt. Victor Corpus defected to the CPP-NPA and led a raid on the PMA armory, timing the raid when most cadets were out on Christmas vacation and the PMA's senior officers including its Superintendent, General Ugalde had left the camp to meet President Ferdinand Marcos upon his scheduled arrival in neareby Baguio City. Corpus, who was PMA's designated officer of the day (OOD), guided the NPA raiding team which managed to escape with Browning Automatic Rifles, carbines, machineguns, and various other weapons and ammunition. = First incidents of violence = According to now retired Brig. General Victor Corpus, the first act of NPA rebellion took place on August 21, 1971 when NPA militants threw two grenades onto the stage at a Liberal Party rally in Manila, killing nine people and injuring 95 others. This is however disputed by most historians, who blamed President Ferdinand Marcos as the perpetrator of the bombing. Jos√© Mar√≠a Sison and the Communist Party of the Philippines continue to deny responsibility of the bombing. Relying on small armed community-based propaganda units, the NPA found itself in an all-out rebellion by 1972. The NPA's first tactical operation, however, would not take place until 1974, two years after Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law. This took place in Calbiga, Samar, where the NPA ambushed an Army scout patrol and seized a number of their weapons.  Rapid growth under the Marcos martial law era  The Communist Party of the Philippines underwent rapid growth from 1972 during the period of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos. The social unrest of 1969 to 1970, and the violent dispersal of the resulting \\"First Quarter Storm\\" protests were among the early watershed events in which large numbers of Filipino students of the 1970s were radicalized against the Marcos administration. Due to these dispersals, many students who had previously held ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù positions (i.e., calling for legislative reforms) became convinced that they had no choice but to call for more radical social change. Other watershed events that would later radicalize many otherwise \\"moderate\\" opposition members include the February 1971 Diliman Commune; the August 1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the wake of the Plaza Miranda bombing; the September 1972 declaration of Martial Law; the 1980 murder of Macli-ing Dulag; and the August 1983 assassination of Ninoy Aquino. This radicalization led to a significant growth of the CPP and of the New People's Army under the Marcos administration. Writer and peace advocate Gus Miclat cites the example of Mindanao: \\"There was not one NPA cadre in Mindanao in 1972. Yes, there were activists, there were some firebrands... but there were no armed rebels then except for those that eventually formed the Moro National Liberation Front. When Marcos fled in 1986, the NPA was virtually in all Mindanao provinces, enjoying even a tacit alliance with the MNLF.\\" The parallel Moro insurgency created favorable conditions for the development of NPA. During the 1970s, 75% of the Philippine military was deployed on the island of Mindanao, a Moro stronghold, despite the 1976 peace deal between the government and MILF. As of 2000, 40% of the AFP troops continued to engage Moro rebels. = Support to the NPA from other countries = China provided support to the NPA from 1969‚Äì1976. After that period, the Chinese ceased all aid, resulting in a five-year period of reduced activity. Despite the setback, the rebellion rekindled with funds from revolutionary taxes, extortion and large scale foreign support campaigns. Both the CPP and NPA attempted to garner support from the Workers' Party of Korea, the Maoist factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Japanese Red Army, Sandinista National Liberation Front, Communist Party of El Salvador, Communist Party of Peru, and the Algerian military. Financial aid, training and other forms of support were received from a number of the above. NDF- controlled trading companies were allegedly set up in Hong Kong, Belgium, and Yugoslavia. At the same time the Communist Party of the Philippines formed a unit in the Netherlands and sent representatives to Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Ireland, United States, Sweden, and various parts of the Middle East. Despite the massive amount of aid previously received, foreign support eventually dried up following the 1990s collapse of socialist governments worldwide.  Incidents during the Corazon Aquino administration (1986‚Äì1992) After Ferdinand Marcos was deposed during the 1986 EDSA Revolution, president Corazon Aquino ordered the release of political prisoners, including Jose Maria Sison and Bernabe Buscayno. Buscayno ceased activities related to the CPP-NPA while Sison eventually went into self-exile in the Netherlands, ostensibly to become chief political consultant to the NDF. Many activists who had joined the underground movement against Marcos chose to resurface.Curaming, Rommel and Claudio, Lisandro, A Historicised (Re)Assessment of EDSA ‚ÄòPeople Power‚Äô (1986) (February 1, 2010). Asia Research Institute Working Paper No. 134. https://ssrn.com/abstract=1716572 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1716572 Preliminary peace talks were held between the new administration and the CPP-NPA-NDF, but these ended when the Mendiola massacre took place on January 22, 1987.  Incidents during the Ramos and Estrada administrations (1992 to 2001)  1992 reaffirmist/rejectionist split = Between the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of volunteers, including youth and teenagers from both urban and rural areas, joined the organization. In 1992, NPA split into two factions: the reaffirmist faction led by Sison and the rejectionist faction which advocated the formation of larger military units and urban insurgencies. Through NPA's history, 13 smaller factions emerged from the group, the most notable being MLPP-RHB, APP, RPA-M, RPM/P-RPA-ABB and CPLA. This split resulted in a weakening of the CPP-NPA, but it gradually grew again after the breakdown of peace talks in 1998, the unpopularity of the Estrada administration, and because of social pressures arising from the Asian Financial Crisis that year. = Repeal of the 1957 Anti-Subversion Act = A breakthrough in the peace process between the Government of the Philippines and the Communist Party of the Philippines took place on October 11, 1992 when Republic Act (RA) 1700 ‚Äì the 1957 Anti-Subversion Act ‚Äì was repealed by RA 7636 and the government declared a policy of amnesty and reconciliation. This was quickly followed by the Hague Joint Declaration of September 1, 1992, in which the Government of the Philippines and the Communist Party of the Philippines (through the National Democratic Front) agreed to work towards formal negotiations and ‚Äúa just and lasting peace.‚Äù = 1995 JASIG and 1998 CARHRIHL agreements = In 1995, negotiations led to the signing of the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG), under which negotiators on either side of the conflict were assured of \\"free and safe movement‚Äîwithout fear of search, surveillance, or arrest.\\" In 1998, another agreement, the Comprehensive Agreement to Respect Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) was signed in an effort to protect civilians from the violence between the two parties. = Resurgence of conflict under the Estrada administration= The peace talks broke down soon after the 1998 agreement, however, and conflict between the two parties resumed at high levels after Joseph Estrada assumed the presidency later that year. In March 2001, a few months after Estrada was ousted by the \\"EDSA II\\" Revolution, National Security Advisor Roilo Golez noted that the number of \\"barangays influenced by\\" the CPP-NPA grew from 772 barangays 1,279 under the Estrada administration, which Golez added was \\"quite a big jump.\\" In July 2001, officials of the Armed Forces of the Philippines noted that the NPA grew in strength \\"at an average of three to five percent yearly\\" since 1998.  Incidents during the Arroyo administration  In 2001, the AFP launched a campaign of selective extrajudicial killings, in an attempt to suppress NPA activity. By targeting suspected rebel sympathizers, the campaign aimed to destroy the communist political infrastructure. The program was modeled after the Phoenix Program, a U.S. project implemented during the Vietnam War. According to Dr William Norman Holden, University of Calgary, security forces carried out a total of 1,335 extrajudicial killings between January 2001 ‚Äì October 2012. On August 9, 2002, NPA was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the United States Department of State. A parallel increase in counter-insurgency operations negatively affected the course of the rebellion. Netherlands-based Jose Maria Sison is currently leader of CPP's eight member politburo and 26 member central committee‚Äîthe party's highest ruling bodies. Despite the existence of the politburo, NPA's local units receive a high level of autonomy due to difficulties in communication between each of the fronts across the country. Rebel recruits receive combat training from veteran fighters and ideological training by Mao Zedong in: the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points of Attention; the Comprehensive Agreement to Respect Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law. NPA units usually consist of 15‚Äì30 fighters, with special armed partisan units of 50‚Äì60 rebels serving in a special operations capacity. NPA also formed a limited tactical alliance with the Moro National Liberation Front and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front on the island of Mindanao, enabling the mutual transfer of troops through each other's territory. Between 1969‚Äì2008, more than 43,000 insurgency related fatalities were recorded. Plantations run by Japanese companies have been assaulted by the NPA.  Recent incidents 2010 and afterward  In the State of the Nation Address by President Rodrigo Duterte which happened on July 2016, Duterte declared a unilateral ceasefire to the leftist rebels. Due to this declaration, the peace talks between the government and the NDF resumed on August 2016. The peace talks were carried out in Oslo, Norway. In February 2017, the CPP-NPA-NDF declared that it would withdraw from the ceasefire, effective on February 10, 2017, due to the unfulfilled promise by the government that it would release all 392 political prisoners. However, the communists attacked and killed three soldiers before the withdrawal, which angered the government and made them declare a withdrawal from the ceasefire also. The peace talks were informally terminated and an all-out war was declared by the AFP after the withdrawal. In March 2017, the government announced a new truce and the resumption of peace talks, to take place in April. The fifth round was planned to take place in June. However, on December 5, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte declared the CPP and NPA as terrorist organizations after several attacks by the NPA against the government. The NDFP, the political wing of the communist rebellion was not included on the proclamation. In order to centralize all government efforts for the reintegration of former communist rebels, President Duterte signed Administrative Order No. 10 on April 3, 2018, creating the Task Force Balik Loob which was placed in charge in centralizing the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP) of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Payapa at Masaganang Pamayanan (PAMANA) program of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP). As of December 30, 2019, the Task Force reported over 10,000 former CPP-NPA rebels and supporters who have returned to the fold of law and availed of E-CLIP benefits, which include a PHP65,000.00 cash assistance, livelihood training, housing benefits, among others. On December 4, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 70,Official Gazette. Executive Order 70, Series of 2018. https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2018/12dec/20181204-EO-70-RRD.pdf which institutionalized a ‚Äúwhole-of-nation approach‚Äù in attaining an ‚Äúinclusive and sustainable peace\\" to help end the decades-long communist insurgency, while also forming the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) which was directed to ensure the efficient and effective implementation of the approach. This order further intensified the Philippine government's campaign against the insurgency, with the Armed Forces of the Philippines reporting 11,605 rebels and supporters surrendering to the government, with 120 rebels being killed and 196 more arrested in military operations from January 1 ‚Äì December 26, 2019.  Incidents in specific regions and provinces =Samar Since the early stages of the rebellion, the island of Samar has been considered to be NPA's main stronghold. While Samar represents 2% and 5% of the Philippine population and territory respectively, 11% of all NPA related incidents have taken place on the island. Samar's terrain consists of densely forested mountainous areas, providing fertile ground for the conduct of guerrilla warfare. An important factor in the spread of the rebellion was the issue of widespread landlessness. Land reforms provided only a limited solution for the millions of Philippine landless farmers. In the case of Samar, 40 landowning clans controlled approximately half of the island's agricultural land. Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups. Another factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation. In 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from Cebu and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion. Between January 2011 and December 2012, a total of 153 insurgency related incidents took place in Samar, resulting in 21 deaths and 55 injuries.  Mindanao  Prior to Ferdinand Marcos' September 23, 1972 announcement of Martial Law, the NPA did not have a presence in Mindanao, which was also only seeing the beginnings of the Moro separatist conflict in the form of clashes between the Ilaga and Blackshirt ethnic militias. Marcos' enformcement of martial law radicalized this situation until, as peace advocate Gus Miclat notes: \\"When Marcos fled in 1986, the NPA was virtually in all Mindanao provinces, enjoying even a tacit alliance with the MNLF.\\" Peace talks Based on the records of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, the Government of the Philippines and the CPP-NPA-NDF had engaged in over 40 rounds of peace talks by November 2017.

Fitzgerald, circa 1912 Richard Burton Fitzgerald (circa 1843 - March 24, 1918) was an American brickmaker and business man who lived in Durham, North Carolina. After building his enterprise, he became president of the black-owned Mechanics and Farmers Bank in Durham, and was involved in other business ventures throughout North Carolina. He served as first president of Coleman Manufacturing Company, established in 1897 as the first cotton mill in the United States to be owned and operated by blacks. His bricks were used for major construction projects in the state's largest cities, including the capital. Born free in New Castle County, Delaware to a white mother and mixed-race father freed from slavery, Fitzgerald and siblings moved with their family in 1855 to Chester County, Pennsylvania to reduce the risk of being taken by slave catchers and sold into slavery under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. After the Civil War, in which he served, Fitzgerald rejoined his family, who had moved to Hillsborough, North Carolina. There they set up a brickyard at their farm. He moved with a brother into Durham, building his business and becoming a major figure in the city's black community. Biography=Early life and Civil War service Fitzgerald was born free about 1843 in New Castle County, Delaware, to Thomas and Sarah (Burton) Fitzgerald. His father Thomas was mulatto or mixed race, of African and Irish ancestry, and manumitted from slavery, likely by a white father and master. His mother was white and of English ancestry; she decided to raise her sons proudly within the community of free people of color, rather than \\"passing\\" as white, although they were of majority European ancestry. Growing up, Richard was described by his great-niece Pauli Murray as a \\"sturdy, rough and tumble fellow... who could work hard but cared more for good times\\" than he did for studying. > \\"Fiery, red-faced blond Richie had the same sharp blue eyes and shrewd > trader's head as his mother. He was quick to drive a hard bargain and even > quicker with his fists. His hot temper led him into many skirmishes and even > as an old man he used to laugh and say, 'By golly, if I was dying and > somebody made me mad, I'd stop dying long enough to fight about it.'\\" At night, his more studious brother Robert would teach Richard and his siblings what Robert had learned in school that day, as both Richard and their brother William (\\"Billy\\") worked in their father's brickyard rather than attend the local Quaker school.Murray, Pauli. Proud Shoes. Harper & Brothers, New York. 1956. In 1855, the Fitzgerald family moved to a farm near Hinsonville in Chester County, Pennsylvania. They wanted to reduce the risk to their children of being kidnapped by slave catchers and sold into slavery. The catchers were active after bounties were offered under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Fitzgerald joined the Quartermaster Department as a civilian contractor in Philadelphia, as blacks were not yet allowed to serve in the military. In 1862, he was transferred to the Army of the Potomac's Washington supply base, where he drove mules for the Union army, spending most of 1862 at Harrison's Landing and the Fort Monroe area. The United States Colored Troops were founded in 1863. Fitzgerald \\"went to sea\\" later in the war, likely as a merchant seaman. Postwar career In late 1869, Fitzgerald and his brother Billy joined their family on a farm east of Hillsborough, North Carolina, where they had settled after moving from Pennsylvania and purchasing the land. The brothers set up a brickyard at the family farm, aided by their father and their brother Robert. However, a financial crisis was gripping the country and locally a bad drought was occurring. The Fitzgerald brick business had produced 40,000 bricks, but had no buyers. The brothers made several trips to Raleigh to try to sell their bricks, but to no avail. Billy returned to Pennsylvania within a few months of arriving in North Carolina. Fitzgerald also became disheartened by the local business prospects, and returned to Pennsylvania. His brother Robert, however, had secured an order for 4,000 bricks for state railroad improvements. Robert also obtained a contract to make 4,000,000 bricks for construction of the new state penitentiary in Raleigh, and wrote Richard and Billy about the contracts, persuading them to return to North Carolina. They began the contracts in the spring of 1870, hiring a crew to assist with production. They soon traveled to Raleigh and began setting up the brick production site. However, a flash flood destroyed several thousand bricks, and Billy departed again for Pennsylvania. Richard and Robert salvaged some of the bricks, and produced 525,000 more, for which they were paid eighty-five cents per thousand. After paying off their business debts and their laborers, they came away with a net profit of $83.10 for four months' work. Marriage and family Marriage license for Richard B. Fitzgerald and Sarah Ann Williams, April 4, 1870 The Richard B. Fitzgerald family, circa 1900 On April 4, 1870, Richard married Sarah (\\"Sallie\\") Ann Williams at her parents' house. They had at least 12 children together; their sons were Charles (born 1876), Samuel (born 1883), Richard (1882‚Äì1886), Burton (\\"Burke\\"; 1887‚Äì1916), and William (1892‚Äì1927); and daughters were Lilly (born ca. 1873), Sarah (born 1874), Leer (born ca. 1878), Susan (born ca. 1880), Beatrice (born 1880), Alma (1893-1941), and Irene (born 1896). Sons Burke and Samuel followed their father into brickmaking; Samuel continued the family business after his father's death.1880, 1900, 1910 U.S. Federal Censuses. Move to Durham and expansion Several years later, with his brother Robert, in 1879 Fitzgerald moved his own family to Durham, based on potentially favorable financial prospects within the developing tobacco manufacturing economy. \\"In Durham Richard Fitzgerald bought a large tract with a good vein of clay for brick in the vicinity of later Gattis and Wilkerson streets... here he began a brickyard and built an eighteen-room house shaded by a grove of maples and magnolias\\".Anderson, Jean B. Durham County: A History of Durham County, North Carolina. The Historic Preservation Society of Durham. Duke University Press, 1990. According to his grandniece Pauli Murray, \\"Within the next fifteen years Uncle Richard became Durham's leading brick maker. By 1884, he had a large brickyard on Chapel Hill Road and orders on hand for two million bricks\\". His brick company was located at the corner of Fitzgerald Street and Chapel Hill Road, and later Wilkerson and Gattis streets (which may be the same location, but the street names changed).Chas. Emerson's North Carolina Tobacco Belt Directory. Edwards, Broughton, and Co., Raleigh, 1886; 1911 Durham City directory. 1886 ad for R. B. Fitzgerald's brick manufactory Tobacco manufacturer William T. Blackwell told Fitzgerald that he would purchase all the brick he made. By 1910 Fitzgerald was producing \\"30,000 brick a day from his $17,000 plant, but owns besides of land within the city limits and has $50,000 worth of real estate.\\" W.T. Bost, the city editor of the Durham Herald, said that Fitzgerald \\"makes better brick than any other man in town; therefore the people buy Fitzgerald's brick\\".Harlan, Louis R., Raymond W. Smock, and Geraldine McTigue (eds.). The Booker T. Washington Papers, Volume II, 1911-1912. Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1981. 58, 63. Thirty years of brickmaking (i.e. prior to 1913) had \\"netted Fitzgerald a big brickyard with a $6000 cement dryer, which makes it possible to turn out brick at all seasons; a yard whose capacity is 30,000 bricks per day, and whose value, including ten acres of land, is $17,000.\\" His holdings in 1913 were valued conservatively at $100,000. \\"Turning his profits into real estate, he has... invested $1500 in a lot and five years later sold the property for $6000; he bought forty acres of farm land for $800, made brick on it for ten years and then sold it for $3000\\".Richardson, Clement. \\"What are Negroes doing in Durham?\\" Southern Workman, Vol. 42., 1913. 389-90. Besides brickmaking, Fitzgerald was involved in many other business ventures. In 1885, he purchased newspaper printing equipment to start a newspaper for the African-American community in Durham; no known editions survive and it is not known if he published. In 1895, Fitzgerald and four others started the Durham Drug Company, which was renamed the Fitzgerald Drug Company in 1901, and operated until 1910, when its name was changed. Also in 1901, Fitzgerald became the treasurer for Lincoln Hospital, founded for African Americans.Andrews, R. McCants. John Merrick: A Biographical Sketch. Seeman Printery, Durham, 1920. In 1898, Fitzgerald became the first president of the Coleman Manufacturing Company in Concord, North Carolina. This was the first cotton mill in the United States to be built, owned and operated by blacks. W. C. Coleman, for whom it was named, and several other partners were from Wilmington, North Carolina. Fitzgerald also served as president of the Durham Real Estate, Mercantile, and Manufacturing Company, which was incorporated in 1899. It was \\"formed under the laws of the State of North Carolina to promote manufacturing and mercantile interests\\" for African Americans.Richings, G. F. Evidences of Progress Among Colored People. Published by Geo. S. Ferguson Co., Philadelphia, 1905; Anderson, Jean B. Durham County: A History of Durham County, North Carolina. The Historic Preservation Society of Durham. Duke University Press, 1990. Fitzgerald was among the original incorporators of the Mechanics and Farmers Bank, which received its charter from the State of North Carolina in 1907. It opened its office in 1908 in the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company Building on Parrish Street, which was known as the ‚ÄúBlack Wall Street\\" of the city. Death and burial Richard Fitzgerald's death certificate, March 24, 1918 Richard Fitzgerald died on March 24, 1918. He is buried in what is known as the Fitzgerald section of the Maplewood Cemetery in Durham. This section was originally a private cemetery on the Fitzgerald family land around his large mansion. It was later annexed by the Maplewood Cemetery.  Posthumous recognition  Richard Fitzgerald was recognized alongside C.C. Spaulding Sr. and John Merrick as Main Honorees by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019.

It is bounded on the western end roughly by Bennett Street and Ashland Avenue, and on the east by Beach Street. The village had its beginnings in the 17th century as a fishing and agrarian center, and its major roads were laid out by the late 18th century. The village was at its height in the first half of the 19th century as a fishing center, and it is from that time that most of its buildings date. Growth in the later 19th century was slower, as sea-related economic activity declined and cabinetmaking grew as a local industry. With map (p.41) and seven photos from 1987. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It then included 172 contributing buildings, two contributing structures, four contributing sites and three contributing objects. With non- contributing buildings, the district has a total of 212 buildings, of which 134 are residences, of which 89 were built before 1850. The oldest are 25 Bennett Street (before 1675), which was possibly built for Aaron Bennett and 3 North Street (c.1714), built for Benjamin Allen, an innholder. The district has 26 surviving Colonial and Georgian houses. The term village is an affectation that residents who have family that go back generations largely reject.

The Carleton House at 185 Main Street is a particularly high- quality Italianate house, with Tuscan pilasters, bracketed deep eaves, and molded window hoods with bracketing. The Hunking House, 160 Main Street, exemplifies the evolution of architecture: built as a typical Greek Revival house, it was moved to its present location in 1871 and expanded with Italianate details, and remodeled again with Classical Revival details in 1923 when it was converted for use by the local American Legion branch.

The district encompasses a well-preserved former textile mill village developed in the mid-19th century, with a variety of worker and upper-class housing, and two historic mill complexes. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Machine Shop Village is located just east of the modern center of North Andover, and is roughly centered at the junction Water, Elm, and High Streets. Water Street roughly parallels Cochichewick Creek, which flows northwest just to its south, and provided the power for the village's industries. Two multibuilding brick industrial complexes extend along the north side of Water Street on either side of High Street, and the residential areas are south of Water Street. Non-residential civic buildings include the 1865 Trinitarian Congregational Church, and a few small wood-frame commercial buildings, a remnant survivor of a more numerous group that populated the village at its height. The area has been the site of industrial development since the 18th century, but textiles began to be produced in North Andover only in 1802. The oldest mill building in Machine Shop Village is a stone structure dating to about 1825. The village developed most during the mid-19th century, and includes a number of examples of worker housing, including a particularly well-preserved series of double cottages on Water Street that date to 1839. Several of the mill managers and owners also lived in the village, leaving examples of relatively high style Greek Revival, Italianate, and Second Empire residences. The Blanchard House at 10 Elm Street is a particularly fine example of Queen Anne architecture, designed by William C. Richardson of Boston and completed about 1881.

He graduated from Harvard University at the age of 20, and received a medical degree from Harvard in 1914. In his final year of medical school, he was chosen to do clinical research at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He served as an associate in medicine there and at the Rockefeller Institute. In 1916, Levine was one of two young physicians recruited by the Harvard Infantile Paralysis Commission to cope with the caseload of that year's poliomyelitis epidemic. In August 1921, Levine gave advice in the case of Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness. He was the first to diagnose it as polio. Levine was appointed assistant professor of medicine at Harvard in 1930, and physician at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in 1940. He was clinical professor of medicine at Harvard from 1948 until his retirement in 1958. He was a consultant in cardiology at Brigham Hospital until his death, and affiliated with six other hospitals in the United States. Levine was a pioneer in the treatment of coronary thrombosis. He was the second American physician to diagnose the condition, which he detailed in his book, Clinical Heart Disease (1936). He was a noted teacher and trainer of heart specialists, and also helped diagnose pernicious anemia. Charles E.

The novel mixes fictional characters with historical events and figures, to narrate the story of the nascent United States of America during the time of the American Revolution. While the novel continues the story of Philip Kent, started in The Bastard, a large portion focuses on Judson Fletcher, a newly introduced character, as a different rebel. In 1979, the novel was made into a television film by Operation Prime Time, The Rebels.  Plot summary  The story begins on June 17, 1775, at the Battle of Bunker Hill, in which Philip Kent participates. One major event, the marriage of Philip and Anne Ware, took place in the interim. In September of that year Anne gave birth to her first child, whom they named Abraham after her father. Philip then participated in Henry Knox‚Äô mission to transport cannons from Fort Ticonderoga. Meanwhile, Judson Fletcher, a drunkard and a womanizer still pursued Peggy Ashford McLean, the wife of his friend Seth McLean, whom he had courted before her marriage. Judson lived with his father on Sermon Hill, a large tobacco plantation on the Rappahannock River in northern Virginia. During a great rebellion of slaves Peggy was raped, Seth killed; Angus Fletcher, opposed to Judson's defense of black slaves (and his accusation of white violence that caused it) and his way of life, put his son out of house. Judson‚Äôs brother, Donald, was a Virginia delegate to the Second Continental Congress, but he suffered from gout and was unable to fulfill his duty, so designated Judson to act in his stead. While attending Congress in Philadelphia, Judson began an affair with Alicia Parkhurst, who now called herself Alice, a former lover of Philip Kent‚Äôs. When Tobias Trumbull, Alicia‚Äôs uncle, found her, he tried to take her home, which Judson prevented, after which Trumbull challenged Judson to a duel and scheduled it for July 3, 1776. The day before the duel, during a debate on the Lee Resolution, Judson was dismissed from the Virginia delegation for drunkenness and therefore missed his chance to vote on the resolution. The next day, he killed Trumbull in the duel and shortly afterwards, Alicia committed suicide by drowning. While Philip was camped with George Washington‚Äôs army in August 1777, he was reunited with his old friend from France, Gil, the Marquis de Lafayette. They participated in the devastating Battle of Brandywine, which left Philadelphia, then the American capital, to be captured by the British. After his expulsion from the Virginia delegation, Judson returned home, but could not move back to Sermon Hill with his father; instead, he lived with Lottie Shaw at a place once owned by her late husband. One day, in a drunken rage, he expelled her from her own property. Soon after, he visited Peggy McLean, by then a widow, and raped her; unbeknownst to him, this encounter would produce a daughter, Elizabeth. Later, when his brother told him that George Rogers Clark had returned to Virginia, Judson rode to meet him. Clark had been a childhood friend and was now recruiting men for a military expedition to the Northwest Territory. Judson enlisted with him, but when he returned home he was met by a disgruntled Lottie, who shot him and left him for dead. Though Judson, because of his wounds, missed his rendezvous, once he recovered he set off for Pittsburgh in hopes of meeting Clark. When he was reunited with Clark, Clark refused to include him in his detachment, due again to drunkenness. On returning to his boat, Clark caught a spy in the act of stealing his orders. After a scuffle the spy shot at Clark, but Judson absorbed the ball and was mortally wounded. Meanwhile, Anne Kent had taken the money she had inherited from her father, who had recently died, and invested it with privateers who were aiding the Americans on the high seas. During the time that Philip was away with the army, one of the privateers with whom Anne had invested her money, Malachi Rackham, made overtures towards her, which she rejected. In 1778, he abducted her and took her aboard his ship. After he repeatedly beat and raped her, she fought for her freedom, but in the ensuing struggle both Anne and Rackham were thrown overboard. Philip participated in the Battle of Monmouth and was wounded in the leg, after which he was mustered out of the army. He was informed of Anne‚Äôs disappearance in a letter from the captain of the privateer in which Anne had invested. As the privateer had captured a British vessel, the investment provided Philip with the money he utilised to begin a publishing firm, Kent and Son. Almost a year later, Gil introduced Philip to Peggy McLean, who would become his second wife.

Although it originally formally fronted on Washington Street, it extends on its long axis for most of a city block along Farrar Street. The original Washington Street entrance has been filled in, and the present entrance is now at what was the rear of the building, the southeast side, where there is a metal awning leading to a modern glass door. Windows on the street-facing sides are paired, with granite sills and header arches of a lighter-colored brick than the main body of the building. Brick pilasters rise between these paired windows the full height of the building, to a modestly-corbelled cornice. The Lynn Realty Company was a company formed to redevelop Lynn after a disastrous fire in 1889 destroyed much of the downtown, along with major shoe factories. The Company had this building built in 1902, when the shoe business began to show signs of recovery. The building provided space for all manner of businesses related to the manufacture of shoes, providing power and a fire-safe environment. Although the building was fitted for steam power, it was designed with an electrical system (then a novelty) as a backup. However, the low cost of the electrical power meant that the steam system was apparently never used. The building has been converted to residential use.

There arose several technical issues, such as the tarpauline cover blowing away in a storm on the day before the winners were to be announced, the reels of Hitchcock‚Äôs Notorious shown in reverse order, and George Sydney‚Äôs The Three Musketeers projected upside-down. During the first festival, the jury was made up of one representative per country, with French historian Georges Huisman as the Jury President. With more emphasis on creativity than in competitiveness, eighteen nations presented their films. Eleven of them tied for the first Grand Prix of the International Festival.  Jury  The following people were appointed as the Jury for the feature and short films: *Georges Huisman (France) (historian) Jury President *Iris Barry (USA) *Beaulieu (Canada) *Antonin Brousil (Czechoslovakia) *J.H.J.

New NIH Toolbox Rolled Out for Standardized Behavioral and Clinical Assessment Measures.Neurology Today. 2012; 12(21):7 PTSD Dalton has extensively researched the relationship between smell and negative memories. She has conducted experiments showing that a strong odourant can turn even a mundane experience into a vivid and permanent memory. This research has important implications for studying and treating PTSD. Dalton continued this line of research in order to determine if it is possible to inoculate people with certain odors in order to prevent the formation of traumatic memories. She found that if you first exposed someone to a strong door in a non-threatening environment and then exposed them to the same odor in a stressful, negative context there was no association between the smell and the negative memory. Dalton's research led to the United States military changing how it trains soldiers. Mock combat environments used for training exercises now include olfactory cues designed to mimic smells like dead bodies, open sewers, melting plastic, etc. Stink bomb Dalton was asked by the United States military to design a \\"stink bomb\\" in 1998. Dalton discovered that culture and geography mediate the sense of smell.

History The mansion was built between 1897 and 1898 for Henry Bradford Lewis (1868-1951), who made a considerable fortune from his scouring mills in Lawrence. Lewis was in charge of the three mills of the E. Frank Lewis Co. and the American Lanolin Co., which employed 500 persons at their peak. The manufacturer spared no expense‚Äîor whimsey‚Äîin creating and furnishing this estate. The architect of the house was Otis A. Merrill, of the Lowell firm of Merrill & Cutler.Page xii, The American Architect and Building News (August 28, 1897) It was formerly attributed to George G. Adams of Lawrence, who designed a similar mansion for Lewis' father in that city. At his death in 1951 Lewis left $80,750 in real estate (including this house and its greenhouse at $35,000 and No. 17 Hidden Rd, bought for his daughter) and more than $97,000 in personal estate, most of which was left to his wife Lillian. As Lewis anticipated, the house was too large to be maintained for only one occupant, and the building was sold in 1953 to C. Lincoln Giles, and converted into apartments. The carriage house is now a single-family residence. The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places because it is distinguished: * by its association with a wealthy Lawrence manufacturer * as an excellent example of around the start of the 20th century architecture on a grand scale.  Architecture  The Colonial Revival style structure is characteristically voluminous with such classical motifs as Palladian and oculus windows, but it also retains a Queen Anne playfulness. Small, unexpected features as large as the cross-gambrel pavilions and as small as an oriel window in an exterior chimney give a cheerful picturesqueness to the imposing mass. The original, Colonial Revival carriage house at the rear is similarly large in scale, with wood shingles and a large gambrel roof that complements the main house.

The house is a large colonial 2.5 story wood frame house, eight bays wide. The northern half of the house is three bays deep, and the southern half is two deep. Its complicated construction history begins in 1700, when Zaccheus Goldsmith was given permission to take timber for the purpose of building a house wide and deep. This structure was two stories high, with a leanto section in the rear and a chimney on its right. An addition during the Georgian period removed that chimney and doubled the size of the house, and moved the front door to the north side. A wing was added on the south during the 1780s, and the exterior was remodeled later to give the house a Federal style appearance. The interior of the house includes surviving decorative features from all three periods of construction. The house is also notable for its purchase in 1806 by Timothy Pickering, a former United States Secretary of State. Pickering transformed the Goldsmith property into a rural country estate, planting linden and larch trees on the grounds. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame house that was built in stages by Mathew Stanley or his heirs between c. 1675 and 1693 and subsequently enlarged by the Lake family. It illustrates a host of building practices over the 17th and 18th centuries. The first Matthew Stanley house was said by Dow to be located northwest of this building.The first portion of this building is the section from the chimney westward. An easterly room was added after and a further addition to the east by the Lakes ca.1750. Matthew Stanley's heirs having removed to the Attleborough Falls area, sold the 70 acre farm property 1710- 1718 to Eleazer Lake. The property also includes a rare First Period barn. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. In 2005 it was named a contributing property to the River Road-Cross Street Historic District. Description and history The Stanley Lake House is set on the north side of River Road in a rural section of Topsfield. The road is rural, roughly paralleling the Ipswich River, which runs west-to-east to the south. The house is set close to the road. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, eight bays wide, and a single room deep. A small leanto section extends part of the building to the right rear, and a larger 19th-century addition extends it to the left rear. The facade is asymmetrical, with entrances in the rightmost bay and in the third from the left. The rightmost entrance is more elaborately decorated, with flanking pilasters and a gabled pediment. Brick chimneys rise from the center roughly behind the entrances. The house was built in several stages over a period of decades, beginning c. 1675-1690, when the leftmost three bays were built. Around 1693 two bays were added to t right, and a leanto section was added further to the right sometime before 1710. About 1710, the leanto was raised to a full two stories in height, adding two bays. The rightmost bay and chimney were added in 1752. Architectural analysis identified the differing construction methods used to build each section and the sequence in which they were constructed. The original builder of the house was perhaps Matthew Stanley, whose heirs sold it in 1710 to Eleazer Lake. The barn standing on the property is an extremely rare First Period barn, its presence was recorded in a deed transfer in 1718. It is a post-and-beam structure, built using First Period construction techniques, and was originally four bays in size, enlarged to five not many years later.

Built in 1906 for George Kunhardt, a principal owner of textile mills in the Merrimack Valley, the estate later became known as Campion Hall when it served as a Jesuit retreat center. After sitting vacant for many years, the property has been converted into residential condominiums. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 22, 1976. Description and history The George Kunhardt Estate is located in a rural residential setting in northeastern North Andover, overlooking Lake Cochichewick to the south. Much of the estate's have been developed as a residential subdivision, and the estate's main house and carriage house now form part of that development. The main house is a large and somewhat rambling 2-1/2 story Victorian structure, with asymmetrical massing and projecting sections typical of the Queen Anne style. The main block has a steeply pitched roof that is gabled at one end and hipped at the other, with two-story gabled projections giving it a T shape. A two-story wing extends further east along the main block, with an angled section joining it to the main block. The exterior is finished in red brick, with limestone trim elements that include corner quoining and window sills and lintels. In several places, dormers pierce the main roof sections, either with a hip roof or truncated hip roof. The estate house was designed by Stephen Codman of Boston, a close friend of George Kunhardt, owner of a textile mill complex in Lawrence. Kunhardt sent Codman to Europe to study German architecture, which Kunhardt himself had been exposed to when he traveled there to learn about German textile processing techniques. The house was built in 1906, and was Kunhardts home until his death in 1935. It was acquired by the Jesuits in 1937, and converted by them into a retreat center. A brick dormitory wing was added to one side of the house, and a guest house was attached via a hyphen to the other side. Both of these structures were torn down during conversion of the building to condominiums, a process that occurred after the Jesuits abandoned the property and it stood vacant for many years.

Time magazine \\"Milestones\\" (spelling: Lojka) Lojka was born on 17 September 1886 in the town of Telƒç in southern Moravia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now part of the Czech Republic). He became a professional chauffeur in the service of Franz, Count Harrach, an Austro-Hungarian nobleman and recent acquaintance of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Lojka accompanied his employer and met the Archduke on his trip to Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 where he served as Ferdinand's chauffeur on his fateful journey. Shortly after leaving the Philippe Barracks where Ferdinand and his wife had joined the Colonel's car they were attacked by a young Bosnian, who threw a grenade at it. However, Lojka was able to swerve out of the way and the grenade bounced away, injuring several dignitaries in the car behind and a number of spectators on the street. After giving a speech at the Town Hall and despite being due to open the new city Museum, Ferdinand decided to visit those injured by the bomb in the hospital. However, this wasn't part of the planned route and Lojka, a Czech was not familiar with the new route and therefore the role of guiding the cavalcade was passed to mayor Fehim Efendi Curƒçiƒá. Consequently, whilst driving away from the Town Hall when Curƒçiƒá took the wrong right-turn down a side street (Franz Josef Strasse on the original route to the Museum) Lojka did as instructed and followed the car in front who had made this error. Chastised for his mistake and told to stop by Governor Potiorek, Lojka did as instructed. However, it so happened that Young Bosnia member Gavrilo Princip was standing in front of the Deli on the street corner just as Ferdinand's car began to pull into it. Princip seized his chance and with his Model 1910 7.65 mm FN Browning in hand he lunged through the crowd. Lojka was attempting to reverse, and Gavrilo Princip shot and killed the Archduke, shooting him in the jugular vein, and his wife Sophie, in the stomach. After the assassination, Lojka was given the task of sending three telegrams of apology: one to the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph, one to the German Emperor Wilhelm II, and one to the children of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. He also served as a witness for the prosecution in the Young Bosnia trial. Lojka was later awarded 400,000 crowns by Austro- Hungarian emperor Charles I, which he used to buy an inn at Brno in Czechoslovakia. There he became an innkeeper, and would often show off the bloodstained braces of Franz Ferdinand and a piece of Sophie's golden bracelet.Story of Franz Ferdinand's drive (in Czech language) He died in Brno in 1926 at just 39 years old. Since Lojka's death, the role of the chauffeur of Franz Ferdinand's car has sometimes been erroneously attributed to a 'Franz Urban'. The Archduke and his wife had in fact travelled from the Station to the Philippe Barracks in a different car - that of Count Alexander von Boos- Waldeck (the car later damaged by the bomb attack). The driver of that car is argued to be Otto Merz, the award winning motor racing driver - which car was relegated to the trailing car at the Barracks when the royal couple were encouraged to switch cars and take up seats in the Harrach vehicle (which they had earlier judged as unsafe) - official records however name the driver as Karl Divjak. Whilst there are stories which claim that after the bombing Merz was forced to bring Ferdinand's bloodstained speech to the town hall on foot, these seem refuted by the stories from Baron von Rumerskirch, the Archduke's adjunct, which claim the speech, splattered in blood, travelled with him in Robert Grein's car to the town hall where he personally handed it to the Archduke, only then noticing the blood stains.

The third floor windows are half-height, a design seen in period mansion houses in Salem. The building corners have wide fluted Doric pilasters that taper as they rise to a moulded cornice. The interior follows a center hall plan, with a fine staircase in the main hall, with a particularly fine fireplace surround in the southwest parlor. A series of ells project to the rear of the house, and a mid-19th century barn with Gothic features stands just to its right. The house was built in 1784 for Doctor Thomas Kittredge, a prominent local doctor who served in that capacity in the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. The Kittredges remained a prominent medical family in the Andover-North Andover area, producing generations of doctors through the 19th and 20th centuries.

Martha (Solart) Kilham was the daughter of John, Sr. and Elizabeth (-----) Solart, who kept a tavern in Wenham, still standing at 106 Main Street. John Solart was financially successful, yet drowned himself in 1672 leaving an estate of over ¬£500. His widow soon remarried Ezekiel Woodward, and kept her seven children from receiving their rightful share of Solart‚Äôs estate. Eventually, these children successfully petitioned the General Court for redress in 1682.For death of John ‚ÄúSoolard‚Äù the ‚ÄúFrenchman‚Äù on May 24, 1672, see Vital Records of Wenham (1904), 220; for marriage of Elizabeth ‚ÄúSoolart‚Äù and Ezekiel Woodward on December 20, 1672, see Vital Records of Wenham (1904), 166.

Sarah's 4 year-old daughter Dorothy Good (also known as Dorcas Good) was also accused and arrested for witchcraft. Dorothy Good survived the hysteria, but was the youngest to be accused of witchcraft during the Salem episode.Boyer and Nissenbaum, Salem Possessed (1974), 3, 5. Thomas and Martha (Solart) Kilham had six children that we know of, all born in Wenham and the last two likely born in the Solomon Kimball House. However, Wenham's records of births for the periods 1681‚Äì1685 and 1688‚Äì1694 (and deaths for 1679‚Äì1694) have been lost. Consequently, we should keep open the possibility that Thomas and Martha had other children who were born and died during the 1680s and early '90s. After all, seven years passed between the birth of their son Thomas Jr. and the baptism of their son Samuel.All children: Mills, \\"The Early Kilhams\\" (1902), 346.

Thomas Kilham bought the 100-acre farm of Zerubabel Endicott, which was located on property that had been part of a 550-acre grant to Endicott‚Äôs grandfather, Governor John Endicott, for ¬£180. The farm included a house that Zerubabel Endicott had built circa 1682, as well as a barn. The farm no longer exists, due to the construction of U.S. Route I-95. The farm house originally stood about 50 feet from the bridge for the Masconomet Regional School, exit #51 over route I-95, in what is now the median strip; it was subsequently moved to River Road, Topsfield (MA). A family cemetery (the Killam-Curtis Cemetery) is located in the southeast corner of the school property, and it is thought that Kilham and his wife are buried here. Thomas Kilham‚Äôs daughter-in- law Grace Endicott was a daughter of Zerubabel Endicott. Perley, The Dwellings of Boxford (1893), 147-148, citing transaction date of January 25, 1701/2.

He died there in 1725 and his burial was likely the genesis of the Killam-Curtis Cemetery. Martha died after Thomas did, but no record of her death has survived.Neither Thomas‚Äôs nor Martha‚Äôs death is recorded in the published vital records of Boxford or Topsfield. Thomas deeded his Boxford homestead to his sons Thomas Jr., John and Samuel in March 1725, and had died by September 1725 when Thomas Jr. and John signed a deed that divided the property that they had jointly inherited from their late father. See Essex County Deeds 44:240 (Thomas Kilham to Samuel Kilham, 1725), 181 (Thomas Kilham to Thomas Jr. and John Kilham, 1725); and 48:33 (division of property between Thomas Jr. and John Kilham, 1725). Thomas Sr.‚Äôs deed to his sons Thomas Jr. and John made reference to Thomas Sr.‚Äôs (unnamed) wife‚Äîwhich suggests that she probably survived him‚Äîand assigned them the responsibility of providing for Thomas Sr.‚Äôs and her funerals. { thumbWenham Town Clerk's record of the 1696 timber grant to Kilham, providing lumber apparently for the construction of his houseThe town clerk's records from this period are available on microfilm at the Massachusetts State Archives.

He lived in a house near the current-day intersection of Cherry Street and William Fairfield Drive, a house that he probably built around 1687 coincident with his first marriage.William‚Äôs house was on the north side of what is now Cherry Street, about 200 feet east of what is now Topsfield Road, and appears as the ‚ÄúA. Bagley‚Äù house in the 1872 Beers‚Äô atlas of Wenham. William‚Äôs grandfather John Fairfield was granted 90 acres in the vicinity of the current-day intersection of Cherry Street and Topsfield Road in 1639, and ‚Äú[t]he grant was used as farmland until it became the home of [William Fairfield].‚Äù See Wenham in Pictures and Prose, 1992, pp. 126-128. (The land adjacent to Fairfield's house included a burial ground that the family started in 1691.The oldest gravestone in the burial ground is that for William Fairfield, Jr., who died in infancy in 1691. The Fairfield Family Burial Ground is Wenham‚Äôs only surviving family cemetery. It‚Äôs possible that other families similarly buried their loved ones on their own land, but if another family cemetery existed, the memory of it‚Äîas well as its grave markers‚Äîhad disappeared by 1860. (The Fairfield Family Burial Ground is the only cemetery other than the town cemetery included in the history of the town published that year. See Allen, The History of Wenham, 1860, pp. 126-132.) If the Fairfields began using the burial ground prior to William, Jr.‚Äôs death, any older gravestones had disappeared by the time of the compilation of Vital Records of Wenham, published in 1904, as William, Jr.‚Äôs is the oldest gravestone record included for that cemetery.) The Fairfield Farm was contiguous to the Thomas Kilham Farm, and Fairfield apparently bought the Kilham property as an investment. He gave the former Thomas Kilham homestead to his son Josiah Fairfield as a wedding gift in 1725.In William‚Äôs 1725 deed to Josiah, it is clear that Josiah was already living in the former Thomas Kilham house. Josiah had married Eunice Cogswell on December 21, 1724 in Ipswich; see Essex Institute, Vital Records of Ipswich, 1910, vol. 2, p. 156. A son of Ens.

He held, at different times, every office in the gift of the people of his native town and State, and in all, he gained the confidence of those whom he was called to serve. He was also an active member of the church, and for many years one of its deacons. : We regret that so little can now be ascertained concerning Mr. Fairfield. An anecdote is still told of him, which is quite characteristic. The common mode of travelling in those days was on horseback. Setting out to attend a session of the Legislature, he became so absorbed in thinking of the business on which they were to enter, and upon his duties as Speaker, that he is said to have actually reached Boston, bridle in hand, before discovering that he had left his horse at home.Allen, The History of Wenham, 1860, pp. 136-137.

Matthew was the first of Josiah‚Äôs sons to reach adulthood, and it‚Äôs likely that when he married Abigail they took up residence in Josiah and Elizabeth‚Äôs house. This was certainly the case by 1771, when Matthew and Abigail were living in the lean-to of the house, Josiah and Elizabeth were living in the other part of the house, and Josiah gave Matthew the lean-to and part of the cellar (along with one half of a cider house and cider mill nearby).Essex County (MA) Deeds, Book 135, pp. 80-81. { class=\\"infobox\\" Matthew Fairfield fought in the Revolutionary War.

At some point during the Revolution, Capt. Fairfield and his company were sent to Hillsborough County, New Hampshire : to quell the Tory insurrections, or mobs, that existed ‚Ä¶ where the old loyal Scotch element so largely predominated. ‚Ä¶ His greatest troubles were in New Boston, where the Tories had their rendezvous. But it appears that here he found friends, and soon after the war he moved his family from Wenham, Mass., to New Boston, and settled on a tract of land in the south part of the town, where he resided until his death, in 1814 [sic], which was occasioned by the falling of a tree.Cogswell, History of New Boston, 1864, p. 409.

Current-day Maple Street appears, as does that portion of current-day Topsfield Road northwest of Maple Street. (Note that current-day Topsfield Road did not extend to the Beverly town line, but stopped at current-day Maple and Cherry Streets.) * 1831: Surveyed by Philander Anderson, this map shows the expansion of Wenham‚Äôs system of roads, the addition of swampland, and a drawing of the Wenham Meeting House. * 1872: This map shows the Solomon Kimball House as ‚ÄúT. Kimball Est[ate].‚Äù The ‚ÄúA. Bagley‚Äù house, near the northeast corner of the intersection of current-day Cherry Street and Topsfield Road, was the William Fairfield homestead. * 1884: This map shows the Solomon Kimball House as ‚ÄúS. Kimball.‚Äù * 1910 (Western & Central Wenham): This map shows the Solomon Kimball House as ‚ÄúS Kimball‚Äù and provides the location of the house itself as well as three out buildings. The outline of the house indicates an ell or porch at the northeast corner of the building that no longer exists. * 1910 (Maple & Bomer Streets): This on-the- ground survey of properties adjacent to Maple and Bomer Streets (Bomer Street subsequently known as the portion of Topsfield Road southwest of Maple and Cherry Streets) shows the location of an orchard and garden belonging to Solomon Kimball, northwest of the Moulton lot (which was opposite Company Lane). The 1910 map of western and central Wenham, however‚Äîwhich likely was not drawn from an on-the-ground survey‚Äîidentifies the lot northwest of the Moulton lot as ‚ÄúHrs. E. Kimball‚Äù (or heirs of E. Kimball). This label is probably a typo; the lot northwest of the Moulton lot would have been owned by heirs of Thomas Kimball or by Solomon Kimball himself. * 1955: The subdivision of the Solomon Kimball farm began in 1955 and continued through the mid-1960s, creating Puritan Road, Mayflower Drive and the lots facing those streets. This 1955 map, drawn at the beginning of the subdivision program, shows the location and outline of the Solomon Kimball House and two outbuildings; note the outline of an ell or porch on the north side of the house that no longer exists.See Essex County (MA) Deeds, Plan Book 90, plan 89 (1958) for a plan of Puritan Road; Plan Book 97, plan 62 (1961) for the lot lines of a 22.7 acre parcel that would become the Mayflower Drive neighborhood; and Plan Book 106, plan 30 (1966) for a plan of Mayflower Drive. See also Plan Book 73, plan 52, sheet 3 (1941), land of Elwell F. and Luella M. Kimball, for (1) the original location of the driveway and (2) the stone wall along the north side of Maple Street. The driveway was moved (probably when Puritan Road was built) from the property‚Äôs southwest corner on Maple Street to the intersection of Maple Street and Puritan Road. The stone wall in front of the house, along the north side of Maple Street, was removed, perhaps at the same time the driveway was relocated.

It is the oldest library building in Putnam County, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It was built in 1914 by Arietta Crane Reed as a tribute to her late husband, William Belden Reed, an ardent supporter of the Literary Union of Carmel, which operates the library. It is a Tudorbethan-style building of local stone with marble accents, and much original period furnishing inside. Building The library occupies a corner lot; it takes the form of a one-story trapezoid faced in rock quarried around nearby Lake Gilead. Its slate roof has three gables; a flat-roofed section between the two in the rear curves to form a rounded rear elevation. The main entrance has double doors flanked by narrow windows in a rusticated surround with quoined corners. It opens into a small vestibule of tile with marble trim. Behind it is an oval lobby paneled in oak. A colonnade separates it from the reading rooms and stacks in the rounded rear section. The fireplace in the main reading room has a mantel carved in the shape of monks' heads; the one in the children's reading room is a more restrained, standard Gothic Revival style. History Carmel had had a library since 1868, when the Carmel Library Association was formed. Its 900 volumes were first in a member's home, then a local church. This made using it difficult, so in 1881 the Literary Union of Carmel was formed to take control. They housed the books first in homes and later on the second story of a local office building. In 1911 that space was expanded, but the library's collection was growing fast enough that it needed its own space. Two members donated the land; Arietta Crane Reed donated the money for the building in memory of her late husband, an executive with the New York City construction company Miller- Reed. The New York firm of Pryor & Gaylor was commissioned to design a building that could not only serve as a library but a community meeting place. The irregularly-shaped structure accomplished both goals. Reed's company did the structural work; a local firm handled the masonry. Ground was broken in November 1913 and the building was opened and dedicated seven months later, at a total cost of $45,000 USD ($ 2008 USD)). It has remained intact, without any alterations, ever since. Aesthetics The library is the only significant Tudorbethan building in the Carmel area. While there are some Gothic Revival touches on the interior like the mantel in the children's reading room, the bulk of the interior shows the strong influence of the related, contemporary Arts and Crafts style, which was upholding simpler Tudorbethan buildings as an alternative to the architectural flourishes and ornament of the later Victorian era.

The district includes the factories of the Ipswich Mill Company (off Union and Estes Streets), and several blocks of modest worker cottages mostly on side streets off Estes and Kimball Streets. The site had been used as for mills since the 17th century, and was purchased by the Ipswich Mill Company (owned by textile magnate Amos Adams Lawrence) in 1868. Mill worker housing was built surrounding the complex through the early 20th century, when River Court, Peatfield Street, and 1st through 6th Streets were laid out. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Ipswich Mills district is located just south of the Ipswich central business district, on the west bank of the Ipswich River and south of the Choate Bridge. It is bounded on the west by railroad tracks and the Ipswich commuter rail station. The northern part of the district is where the mill complex was located, with the mill-related residential area stretching out to its south. The mill complex at its height was a large collection of masonry structures that were for the most part interconnected in some way, all but two of which were demolished in the 1970s. One of these, the yarn mill, was one the major visual elements of the mill complex. It was built in 1880, and is a four-story brick structure with several side wings that were added in the early 20th century. The second building, used for finishing, is a two-story structure that directly abuts the river, and is now separated from the first building by a passage connecting two parking lots. Most of the residences to the south of the mill complex post-date the establishment in 1868 of the Ipswich Mills. One notable house that stood in the area until the 1890s was the John Whipple House, now a National Historic Landmark, which was used as mill tenement housing prior to being moved to its present location on Ipswich's South Green. The majority of the residential structures are houses that were built by the Ipswich Mill Company in the first two decades of the 20th century. The company built three basic types, which were typically clustered together on the side streets off Estes and Kimball Streets: single-family houses either 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 stories in height, and duplexes. The Ipswich Mill Company was founded in 1868 by Amos Adams Lawrence, and developed this area, which had seen a variety of industrial uses since the 18th century. The company manufactured hosiery, one of the community's early industries, and grew to become the largest hosiery maker in the world between 1916 and 1919, with mills in five New England locations. Demand for the mill's products declined after the First World War, and its mills were shuttered one by one, with the Ipswich mill closing in 1928. The mill complex was acquired by Sylvania Electric in 1941, which was responsible for the demolition of much of the complex in the 1970s.

Description and history The former Intervale Factory stands west of downtown Haverhill, on the south side of River Street, just east of its junction with Swain Street. It is a long four-story brick building, with a flat roof and brick foundation. It is seven bays wide and eighteen long, with the narrow end oriented to the street.

Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was credited for overthrowing the L√Ω Dynasty and establishing the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty by his arrangement of marriage between the Empress Regnant Chi√™u Ho√†ng and his nephew Tr·∫ßn C·∫£nh. After the coronation of Tr·∫ßn C·∫£nh, now Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was appointed grand chancellor and regent of the Emperor. As the most powerful figure of the royal court and the Tr·∫ßn royal family, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was responsible for both civil and military matters in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát; his successful governing was considered by historical books as the crucial factor that not only led to the stability of the early Tr·∫ßn dynastic period but also contributed to the victory of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát over the first Mongol invasion. Although a skilled and devoted official of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô still remains a controversial figure in the history of Vietnam for several ruthless decisions to dispose of members of the L√Ω royal family, and for his responsibility in the forced marriage between Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng and his brother Tr·∫ßn Li·ªÖu's wife, Princess Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n, which was highly criticized by feudal historians. Background Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was born in 1194 as the third son of Tr·∫ßn Qu·∫£, a member of the Tr·∫ßn clan in L∆∞u Gia village (now H∆∞ng H√†, Th√°i B√¨nh). The Tr·∫ßn clan had made its great fortune by fishing for generations.Taylor 2013, p. 120.ed. Hall 2008, p. 159. During the troubled time under the reign of L√Ω Cao T√¥ng, the Crown Prince L√Ω S·∫£m sought refuge in the family of Tr·∫ßn L√Ω, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô's uncle, and decided to marry his beautiful daughter Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Dung in 1209. Afterward, members of the Tr·∫ßn clan helped L√Ω Cao T√¥ng and L√Ω S·∫£m restore their rule in ThƒÉng Long. As a result, the Emperor appointed several members of the Tr·∫ßn clan to high positions in the royal court: they included T√¥ Trung T·ª´, who was uncle of Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Dung, as well as Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Kh√°nh and Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a who were Tr·∫ßn L√Ω's sons. In 1211 the Crown Prince L√Ω S·∫£m was enthroned as L√Ω Hu·ªá T√¥ng after the death of L√Ω Cao T√¥ng; the Tr·∫ßn clan's power at court continued to increase. After the death of Tr·∫ßn T·ª± Kh√°nh in 1223, Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a was appointed to the highest military position at the royal court, while his cousin Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô took charge of the royal guard (Vietnamese: ƒêi·ªán ti·ªÅn ch·ªâ huy s·ª©). Rise to power=Overthrowing the L√Ω Dynasty In October 1224, L√Ω Hu·ªá T√¥ng ceded the throne to his youngest daughter, the Princess Chi√™u Th√°nh, now the Empress Regnant L√Ω Chi√™u Ho√†ng. Chi√™u Ho√†ng was only six at that time, and all important decisions in royal court were made by members of the Tr·∫ßn clan. Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô arranged a marriage between Chi√™u Ho√†ng and Tr·∫ßn C·∫£nh, the eight-year-old son of Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a. With Tr·∫ßn C·∫£nh being the Empress Regnant's husband, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was able to overthrow the L√Ω Dynasty by making L√Ω Chi√™u Ho√†ng pass the throne to Tr·∫ßn C·∫£nh, now Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng, in 1225. After the coronation of his son, Tr·∫ßn Th·ª´a acted as Regent of the Emperor, but it was Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô in the position of Grand Chancellor (Vietnamese: th√°i s∆∞) who decided both military and civil matters in the royal court; he was respectfully called by Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng and Father of the Nation (Qu·ªëc th∆∞·ª£ng ph·ª•). After the collapse of the L√Ω Dynasty, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was afraid that the newly established Tr·∫ßn Dynasty might be dislodged by its political opponents; therefore he continued ruthlessly to eliminate members of L√Ω royal family. On the eighth day of the tenth lunar month (October 30) 1226, he forced the former emperor L√Ω Hu·ªá T√¥ng, who had already abdicated his power, to commit suicide. Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô married Hu·ªá T√¥ng's former empress, Princess Thi√™n C·ª±c Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Dung, who was also Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô's cousin. These actions were criticized by historian Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n in his ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√≠ to√†n th∆∞ as inhumane, though their purpose was to reinforce the reign of Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng. It has been alleged that Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô decided to massacre members of the L√Ω royal family in August 1232 during the death anniversary of L√Ω emperors held in Th√°i ƒê∆∞·ªùng, Hoa L√¢m (now Nam Tr·ª±c, Nam ƒê·ªãnh). However, the authenticity of this account was challenged by the historian Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n, because a member of the L√Ω clan was still appointed as general by Tr·∫ßn Anh T√¥ng and there is no mention this event in Phan Phu Ti√™n's historical record. Strengthening the reign of Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng was enthroned when he was only an 8-year-old boy and there were several revolts in ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát at that time, so Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô had to devote all of his efforts to consolidating the rule of the new Emperor in the royal court and over the country. Right after the coronation of the Emperor in 1226, Nguy·ªÖn N·ªôn and ƒêo√†n Th∆∞·ª£ng rose a revolt in the mountainous region of B·∫Øc Giang and H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng, by both military and diplomatic measures such as sending army to pacify them or even awarding two leaders of the revolt by the title Prince (V∆∞∆°ng), Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was able to put down this revolt in 1229. According to ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√≠ to√†n th∆∞, Th√°i T√¥ng and his wife, the Empress Chi√™u Th√°nh, did not have their first son for a while, so this situation in the royal family made grand chancellor Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô worried because he had profited in the same circumstances of the Emperor L√Ω Hu·ªá T√¥ng to overthrow the L√Ω Dynasty. Therefore, in 1237 Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô decided to force Tr·∫ßn Li·ªÖu to give up his wife Princess Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n for the Emperor when she had been already pregnant with Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc Khang for three months. After the royal marriage, Thu·∫≠n Thi√™n was entitled the new empress of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty while Chi√™u Th√°nh was downgraded to princess. In the fury of losing his pregnant wife, Tr·∫ßn Li·ªÖu rose in revolt against the royal family.Emperor Th√°i T√¥ng felt awkward about the situation and decided to become a monk in Y√™n T·ª≠ Mountain. Finally Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô successfully persuaded Th√°i T√¥ng to return to the throne and Tr·∫ßn Li·ªÖu had to surrender after judging that he could not stand with his fragile force. All soldiers who participated in this revolt were killed, and Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô even wanted to behead Tr·∫ßn Li·ªÖu but was stopped by Emperor Th√°i T√¥ng. Vietnamese historians in dynastic era such as Ng√¥ Sƒ© Li√™n or Phan Phu Ti√™n often criticized decisions of Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô and Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng in this event and considered it as origin for the downfall of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty afterwards during the reign of Tr·∫ßn D·ª• T√¥ng. In 1258, the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty had to face the first Mongol invasion. In the beginning, the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát army suffered several defeats by an overwhelming force which had already conquered vast areas of Asia. Several high-ranking officials of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty were so scared that Prince Kh√¢m Thi√™n Tr·∫ßn Nh·∫≠t Hi·ªáu, younger brother of Th√°i T√¥ng, even suggested to the Emperor that they might escape from ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát to the Song Empire. When the concerned emperor asked Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô about the situation of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty, the grand chancellor answered with a famous phrase: Indeed, the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty was able to counterattack and ultimately drive the Mongols out of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát in 1258. Until his death in January 1264, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô still actively contributed to the royal court. He was posthumously entitled as Prince Trung V≈© (Trung V≈© ƒë·∫°i v∆∞∆°ng). Legacy Almost all historical accounts agree that it was no one else but Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô who deserved credit for the birth of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty, Kh√¢m ƒë·ªãnh Vi·ªát s·ª≠ Th√¥ng gi√°m c∆∞∆°ng m·ª•c commented that maybe for that reason temple name of the first emperor of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty was Th√°i T√¥ng, which was often used for the second emperor of a dynasty, instead of Th√°i T·ªï as usual. Despite his lack of learning, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was praised as a skilled and devoted official of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty, the ruling dynasty which was found by his very own effort. As a result, the grand chancellor held a position in royal court which was so powerful that he was suspected by some of overruling the Emperor. Once there was a person who went to the Emperor to report him about this suspicion, Th√°i T√¥ng immediately visited Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô's place with this man and made him tell everything in front of the grand chancellor. After hearing the story, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô not only accepted that the man had somewhat his reason but also awarded him for being concerned for the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty. His successful governing was considered by historical books as the main factor that not only led to the stability of Early Tr·∫ßn period but also contributed to the victory of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát over the first Mongol invasion. Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was also an honest mandarin who never profited his high position for the benefit of his family. It was said that one time the Emperor wanted to appointed Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô's elder brother Tr·∫ßn An Qu·ªëc for the position of grand chancellor. Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô politely declined the Emperor's request by an answer: \\"An Qu·ªëc is my brother, if he is better than me then I had better retire from the position, but if Your Majesty think that I am better than him, so please not appoint him for grand chancellor. Because if we hold the same position then what royal court will become?\\".in Vietnamese: \\"An Qu·ªëc l√† anh th·∫ßn, n·∫øu cho gi·ªèi h∆°n th·∫ßn th√¨ th·∫ßn xin tr√≠ sƒ©, n·∫øu cho th·∫ßn gi·ªèi h∆°n An Qu·ªëc th√¨ kh√¥ng th·ªÉ c·ª≠ An Qu·ªëc. N·∫øu anh em ƒë·ªÅu l√†m t·ªÉ t∆∞·ªõng th√¨ vi·ªác tri·ªÅu ƒë√¨nh s·∫Ω ra l√†m sao?\\" For his dedication, the Emperor personally redacted an epitaph for Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô in his tomb. However, Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô still remains as a controversial figure in History of Vietnam for his ruthless decisions against members of L√Ω royal family and his responsibility in the forced marriage between Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng and his brother Tr·∫ßn Li·ªÖu's wife, which was highly criticized by feudal historians. Sometimes, his Machiavellian figure was compared with Dorgon, the powerful general who helped establish the Qing Dynasty's rule in China, or Cardinal Mazarin who was chief minister of France for 20 years. Today, the role of Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô in the history of Vietnam is always a matter for debate between modern historians. For this reason, it was not until 2008 that a new street in Hanoi was named in honour of Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô, a decision which is still met with some opposition from public opinion. Unlike his relatives Tr·∫ßn H∆∞ng ƒê·∫°o or Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh·∫£i, the grand chancellor of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty is worshipped in only one place in Hanoi which is the C·∫ßu ƒê√¥ng Pagoda. However, on the occasion of the millenary anniversary of Hanoi, the Feature Film Studio 1 decided to invest 2.66 million USD for a 30-episode television movie named Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô which will focus on his life and the turbulent period of the Late L√Ω and Early Tr·∫ßn Dynasty. In theatre, on the contrary, there were several plays which exploited the controversial role of Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô in history such as R·ª´ng tr√∫c (Bamboo Forest) by the writer Nguy·ªÖn Huy T∆∞·ªüng or Anh h√πng v√† m·ªπ nh√¢n (The Hero and the Beauty) by Chu Th∆°m. According to the stage director L√™ H√πng, the life full of events of Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô was a good source of inspiration in theatre because the play could focus on his inner feelings when Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô had to act ruthlessly toward L√Ω clan for the benefit of his own Tr·∫ßn clan. Family Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô had one wife, Lady Linh T·ª´ Tr·∫ßn Th·ªã Dung, who was entitled as Mother of the Nation (Linh T·ª´ qu·ªëc m·∫´u).

It encompasses an area in and around Massachusetts Route 97, just east of Interstate 95 and south of the junction of those two roads, and includes most of the properties on Ipswich Road and a few on adjacent roads. This area was among the first to be settled in what is now Boxford, and consists of a rural cluster of houses built between about 1750 and 1850. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The town of Boxford was incorporated in 1685, but had probably been settled earlier by landowners from Rowley, from which it was divided. Ipswich Road was from an early date the principal road between Ipswich and Andover, two early colonial settlements. Thomas Perley purchased land along the road and built a tavern in 1684 to serve passing travelers. The site of his tavern is where what is now known as the Asa Perley House stands; it was either built about 1760, or is a substantial alteration of Thomas Perley's original house. Aaron Perley, a later descendant of Thomas, built the fine Federal style house at 35 Ipswich Road in about 1818. Members of the Perley family played a significant role in the early civic life of Boxford, and continue to live in the community. The oldest house with certain dating is the Old Hale House (15 Ipswich Road), which dates to about 1749, and belonged to the Hale family until the late 19th century. Four of the seven historic houses in the district were built by members of the Howe family in the first half of the 19th century. The house were industrious, and several of its members were involved in the shoemaking trade, which at that time was a cottage industry operated out of people's homes or small outbuildings. Both the Edward Howe House (5 Ipswich) and William Howe House (7 Ipswich) were used in shoemaking operations until late in the 19th century.

At the American Civil Liberties Union, Engardio combined reporting and multimedia storytelling skills to pioneer more effective ways to mount lawsuits and communicate public education efforts. He was the ACLU‚Äôs first ‚Äústory finder‚Äù and implemented a process that applied journalism methods to plaintiff-finding. Engardio found plaintiffs who had narratives that played well in both the court of law and public opinion. He also started a video department that produced shorts for online audiences, which prompted mainstream media to cover the same stories. Career Joel Engardio has been a guest columnist for the San Francisco Examiner since 2013 and has written for the Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Christian Science Monitor and P.O.V. magazine. He has written essays broadcast on NPR‚Äôs This I Believe series and KQED-San Francisco‚Äôs Perspectives. Engardio wrote, narrated and directed Knocking, a documentary on Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses that was nationally broadcast on the PBS series Independent Lens.

His undergraduate degree is from Michigan State University, where he majored in journalism and history. He was born and raised in Saginaw, Michigan. Engardio currently lives in San Francisco with his husband Lionel Hsu. Political career Engardio was appointed to the San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee in July 2015 and served until July 2016. The DCCC is the governing body for the local Democratic Party. In 2016, Engardio was the only candidate endorsed by both the San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner in his race for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Engardio finished second in a field of five candidates. He was the first openly gay supervisor candidate to run in San Francisco‚Äôs conservative District 7, where half the voters in some precincts supported a 2008 ban on gay marriage. Engardio serves on the board of directors of San Francisco's United Democratoc Club and Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club. He is vice president of the non-profit grassroots group Stop Crime SF. Knocking Documentary Engardio's documentary film Knocking explored how the unpopular religion of Jehovah's Witnesses played a major role in First Amendment history, setting Supreme Court precedents that expanded individual liberties for all Americans. In interviews, Engardio said Knocking is not about the theology of Jehovah's Witnesses but instead uses the religion as a case study to examine how disparate and disagreeable groups can hold their unique beliefs without marginalizing or limiting the freedom of others. \\"We may not be each others' cup of tea,\\" Engardio said on NPR, \\"but tolerance allows a variety of kettles to peacefully share the stove.\\" Knocking won several film festival awards including Best Documentary at the USA Film Festival and was covered in Newsweek, USA Today and newspapers across the United States. Entertainment Weekly named it \\"What to Watch.\\" Knocking was broadcast in the United States on PBS. It was also broadcast in Australia, Canada, Greece and Israel. Knocking was released on DVD in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Korean. Critics of Jehovah's Witnesses said the film did not deal harshly enough with controversies surrounding the religion, like the practice of shunning. Engardio told film festival audiences that \\"Knocking\\" contained criticism organic to the film's story. Engardio has written Washington Post essays critical of Jehovah's Witness practices, including shunning and refusal of blood transfusions. Engardio has also written essays for the Washington Post and USA Today about civil rights issues involving Jehovah's Witnesses outside the scope of his film. Most notable was the 2010 ruling by a federal judge that overturned California's ban on gay marriage, in which the key legal precedent cited by the judge was a 1943 Supreme Court case won by Jehovah's Witnesses. Another Washington Post essay by Engardio warns that a ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia is a dangerous precedent that could lead to the loss of freedoms for other unpopular groups in the emerging democracy.

The main part of the timber frame house is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. This section shows details of construction that contain both First Period and early Georgian features. The staircase in the front lobby has turned balusters that are possibly original, and are similar in appearance to balusters found at the nearby Smith House on Argilla Road. Both the right-side parlor and second-floor chamber have exposed beams with chamfered corners. The doorway between the parlor and the lobby is topped by a distinctive open latticework transom. Later period features include paneling on the fireplace surround of the left parlor, and Federal period features on the right parlor fireplace. The house has had three major additions: the first, in 1810, add a wing to the left side of the house, where additional Federal style features are found. A full leanto was added to the house rear around the turn of the 20th century, and another extension was added on the rear, probably when the house was used as clubhouse for a golf club that occupied the estate. The leanto addition included stylistically First Period elements to harmonize with those found in the older part of the house.

He continued to play with the more junior teams on his club for some years after. He played in four County Finals for his club He also won the Man of the Match award when playing in the 1994 county success with his division Carbery which allowed him to achieve the honour of captaining his county in the 1995 Senior Hurling campaign. His inter county career began as a Cork minor hurler in 1986. He went on to play u21, Junior and Senior hurling as well as Junior football for Cork. He won an All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship1983\\\\. sportsmanager.ie. medal in 1994 and an All- Ireland Junior Football Championship medal in 1989 together with an All- Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal in 1989. He was also a member of the 1990 senior hurling squad who together with the senior footballers achieved an historic double that year. In 1993 he won a National Hurling League medal with Cork after the epic three match saga with Wexford. His last medal was one in the Intermediate Football final of 2001 but he retired form the big ball game after the game which benefitted his hurling enormously for the next number of years. He attended Hamilton High School in Bandon. At third level he played both Sigerson Cup and Fitzgibbon Cup hurling with UCC He had twice broken the same ankle by the age of 17 . He was regarded a hard but fair competitor . He coached St. Brogans College in Bandon to an All-Ireland success in 2004. After a few years away from the game at a high level (he played for the 3rds' of Newcestown in 2009 ) he was persuaded to join Valley Rovers. As a neighbouring parish and a club beset with inner turmoil at the time, many regarded this appointment as a poison chalice.

It is the largest lake within the federal state, and has a maximal depth of 133 metres. Together with the Achen Valley it parts the Karwendel mountain range in the west from the Brandenberg Alps in the east. Water quality is near drinking water, with sight up to 10 m below the surface. An alpine lake, water temperature is accordingly low, rarely above 20 ¬∞C. Its size and wind conditions make it suitable for windsurfing. Eben am Achensee, Achenkirch, and Pertisau are municipalities on the lake. History The city of Innsbruck bought the lake in 1919 from the St. Georgenberg-Fiecht Abbey, who had received it from the rulers of Schlitters around 1120. Powerplant Since 1924, the lake is managed by the Tiroler Wasserkraft AG (TIWAG), which was founded for this purpose. Originally, its only outflow was the Achenbach, feeding the Isar. Since 1927, when a power plant in Jenbach was finished, it primarily feeds the Inn, at a level difference of 380 m below. Eight pelton wheels at 500 RPM produce a total of 96 MW. In winter, the level of the lake is lowered by up to 6 meters; accordingly the size of the lake keeps changing. At maximum level, the reservoir can store 66 million m¬≥ of water. Tourism St. Joseph (1887) St. Benedikt, about 1900 When the Lower Inn Valley Railway () railway was finished in 1859, tourism started to flourish. In order to make the abbey profit, the first steamboat St. Josef was acquired in 1887. Furthermore the construction of the 7 km long Achenseebahn narrow gauge rack railway was initiated, which went into service in 1889 between Jenbach and Seespitz. On 21 July that year a second steamboat, the St. Benedikt, went into service. In 1890 the two boats with a capacity of 320 seats transported about 30,000 persons. In 1911 a third scheduled boat, the Stella Maris went into service. It was the first passenger boat on a lake in the Danubian monarchy originally equipped with a diesel engine. The boat was designed for 400 passengers, and featured a particularly silent engine at low rpm, similar to those that later were used in the submarines of World War I. However, the Stella Maris was difficult to manoeuvre. When the lake was bought by the city of Innsbruck in 1919, the boat was renamed into Stadt Innsbruck. In 1925 a motorboat named Tirol was acquired, and in 1927 for the first time more than 100,000 persons were transported. In 1959 the St. Benedikt was replaced with a modern ship of the same name with a diesel engine. In 1971 the Tirol was replaced with a larger Tirol II for 40 passengers. In 1994 the MS Tirol went into service, replacing the Stadt Innsbruck, and in August 2007 the MS Stadt Innsbruck replaced the St. Benedikt.

It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two brick chimneys, and exterior clad in synthetic siding. Its front facade is two bays wide, with the entrance on the right, under a hood supported by a simple knee bracket. The left bay has a projecting polygonal bay, and there are two windows in the attic level above. When surveyed in the 1980s, the house had a somewhat more elaborate exterior: the roof had extended eaves with Italianate brackets, and the attic windows had Italianate bracketed surrounds with diamond-shaped keystones. The main entry hood featured Italianate brackets, and similar window detailing was found on the windows of the bay.See photo above for current conditions.

Many styles of cherry pitters exist, including small tools held in the hand, domestic crank- operated machines with a hopper, and industrial machines. Cherry pitter in hand Use of a hand-held cherry pitter involves first removing the stem, then driving a plunger through the cherry in a way that the stone is ejected out the other side of the fruit, often attached to or held by the plunger. Some of the devices used hollow cylindrical plungers that cut the stone out along with adjacent flesh of the fruit. Other devices use a solid plungers (sometimes with teeth, sometimes just a solid shape) to force the pit to breach the flesh. In almost all cases, the fruit is supported against the plunger by a surface with a hole in the middle, so that the entire fruit does not rupture. The range of hand kitchen tools developed for this purpose is vast. Some have platforms to accommodate as many as 7 or more cherries to pit at the same time, employing multiple plungers. The mechanism for the plunger may be fully manual, or it may be retracted by a spring. The path of the plunger may be linear or curved, and the plunger itself may follow the curve of the path of motion. The cost of the gadget ranges from $1 to as much as $20, with the majority sold in grocery stores costing $5-10. In recent years, a number of \\"DIY\\" printable cherry pitter designs have been made available online for 3D printing. Some cherry pitters can also be used as olive [stone] pitters.

The \\"Missed Connections\\" section of Craigslist gets thousands of ads of this type every month in New York City, San Francisco, and Seattle. The feature was started by Jim Buckmaster, Craigslist's CEO, after he noticed a common type of posting in their personal ads, which he characterized as \\"you-smiled-at-me-on- the-subway-platform\\". He sees the format as addressing a common human need and being ideal for romantic comedy, \\"Missed Connections give people that second chance...They represent persistence in the face of long odds, which definitely adds to their artistic appeal.\\" A variety of such artistic works have been developed including illustrations, movies, plays, poetry and songs. Other major cities have similar columns in Craigslist and their own local media. London's Metro newspaper has a \\"Rush-hour Crush\\" column for commuters who exchange glances but nothing more. Many connections are re-established and couples have become married in this way, such as \\"tall rugby player\\" and \\"beautiful lady in the red dress with long brown curly hair\\". Various websites like Gumtree also offer the possibility of reconnecting with missed connections.Manweiler, J., Scudellari, R. and Cox, L.P., SMILE: Encounter- based Trust for Mobile Social Services, Duke University, 2009 Distribution The nature and location of missed connections have been analyzed. Across the United States in 2013, the breakdown by gender was: * 59% Man seeking woman * 27% Man seeking man * 13% Woman seeking man * 1% Woman seeking woman In the Pacific Northwest, the most common location was public transportation. In the Pacific Southwest, it was the gym. In the Northeastern United States, it was the subway and train. In the Midwestern United States, it was the supermarket. In Texas and the Gulf Coast region, it was Walmart. Implementation The online format for this on Craigslist scrolls so that postings disappear after 45 days. This gives a second possibility of loss as the posting might not be seen in time to reunite the couple. Mobile phone apps such as Grindr or Spotted have been created which facilitate hook-ups between strangers immediately, though these require location data. Protocols for facilitating such encounters more safely have been proposed. Art, comedy, movies, plays and poems The topic has been used as a theme by artists and authors. The New York Transit Museum held a special exhibition of such work on Valentine's Day in 2011. Other artistic uses of the theme include Missed Connections NY, a theatrical presentation of thirteen vignettes and comic songs performed by the Upright Citizens Brigade and the long-running Missed Connections: An Exploration into the Online Postings of Desperate Romantics.

The chain currently operates 46 branches with 30 in London, 9 in Scotland and across the rest of the UK, under the leadership of managing director Ayo Akintola. It also operates a trade arm, Oddbins Wholesale, which supplies restaurants, pubs, bars and other businesses throughout the UK. History In 1963, entrepreneur Ahmed Pochee established a small business delivering \\"bin-ends\\" and \\"oddments\\" of wine to restaurants and clubs in London's West End. Ten years later the company was purchased by Nick Baile and Dennis Ing, but it wasn't until the early 1980s that the company's distinct style was discovered. Illustrator Ralph Steadman was asked by Gordon Kerr, the marketing director at that time, to produce ten drawings similar in style to his illustrations for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Steadman continued working for Oddbins for the next 12 years. Due to the levels of debt within the business in the late 1980s, Oddbins was acquired by Seagram, a distribution company that was United States based. It was during this period, that Oddbins was largely permitted to develop with autonomy, albeit with incentive to strongly promote the Seagram brands. The company grew from 100 to 278 locations and came to be regarded as a favourite of a generation of wine drinkers. It was during this period that Patsy Stone (the fictional character portrayed by Joanna Lumley in Absolutely Fabulous) lived in the storeroom of an Oddbins off licence in London. French Groupe Castel, who also owned the Nicolas chain from 2002-2008, purchased the company. It was then bought by Simon Baile, son of Nick Baile. Oddbins operated 158 stores in the United Kingdom, including 20 in the capital, 4 in Ireland and 1 in Calais, France. In 2010 the company launched a new off-licence and convenience store concept called \\"Oddies.\\" A closed branch on Albion Street in Leeds, April 2011 In early 2011 Oddbins closed a third of its branches, reducing the number remaining open to under 100, leading to a proposal to enter a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). In April 2011, Oddbins went into administration, following the breakdown of talks over the CVA after objections from HMRC, which is owed nearly half of the chains' total debt of ¬£20 million. On 26 April, Whittalls Wine Merchants, part of Raj Chatha's European Food Brokers (EFB) group, bought 37 of the shops from the administrators in a move that saved 200 jobs. and acquired the exclusive rights to the name. The remaining 48 shops were closed by the administrators. In mid-2011 Oddbins radically changed their pricing strategy to move away from deep case discounts to offer customers a better price on individual bottles. In addition, head of buying Ana Sapungiu MW overhauled their range. She had an innovative approach to buying, looking to explore the less familiar categories whilst challenging the classic regions for value and point of interest for the engaged Oddbins customer. On 19 October 2011 the new owners officially relaunched Oddbins. On 1 February 2019, Oddbins again went into administration.

It was built in 1846 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The Newell Farm in West Newbury, Massachusetts, was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Researchers for the Massachusetts Historical Commission have found the house significant for two reasons. First, the house is built in a Greek Revival/Federal Style tradition. Second, a portion of the materials used in the construction of the house were salvaged from the demolition of buildings in 1845 on Beacon Hill in Boston to make room for an addition to the Massachusetts State House. Colonel Moses Newell built the 25 room house now standing at 243 Main St. in 1846. His father Joseph Newell was a Sargeant in Captain William Rodger's Third Company, a local West Newbury unit, during the American Revolutionary War. The Newells owned at that time a house which stood closer to the street by the well on the property. The original house was moved across the street to make room for the present house. Moses Newell shuttled the building materials including mantels, inside shutters, windows, panelling, doors, and lintels from Boston after he sent loads of butchered meat from the farm to the Charlestown Navy Yard. Bricks were made in a local brickyard in West Newbury, close to where Pentucket Regional High School now stands. The brick walls are three layers thick with no insulation. The main body of the three story house is square with a peaked roof. It has five bays on the front and sides, four chimneys, granite footings and door lintels, sandstone window lintels and sills, and granite steps. There is a two-story narrower extension of the main building with a side entrance. The main building has fret work at the cornices and under the eaves. The main house has eight feet of cellar space beneath it. The interior originally had 25 rooms plus main halls running east-west and side halls running north-south. There were eight fireplaces in the main building. All twenty-three windows in the major rooms of the main building had wooden interior shutters (six or eight panels per window) with various types of hinges made by J. Clark & Son of Wolverhampton, England. Moses Newell Moses Newell played an active role in civic affairs in the town, almost from the date West Newbury was incorporated as a town on February 18, 1819. He was on the board of Selectmen intermittently from 1822 to 1860, and served as moderator at town meetings at various times during those years. His son, Captain Richard Newell, traveled for most of his life on ships, but he lived in the house after his retirement. A member of the Marine Society of Newburyport, Richard Newell was born in 1834 and went to sea as a young boy of 15, according to an account he wrote himself in the chronicles, \\"The Marine Society of Newburyport\\".

Built in 1866 for a prominent local businessman, it is a high-quality example of Second Empire architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (as being at 281 Ocean Street) in 1985, and included in the Diamond Historic District in 1996. Description and history The Lucian Newhall House stands in Lynn's Diamond District, a residential area where the city's elite lived during the period of historical significance. The house stands at the northeast corner of Nahant and Ocean Streets, presenting finished facades to both streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a flared mansard roof. At the center of the roof is a square cupola with three round-arch windows on each side, and a broad-eaved hip-roof with an elaborate bracketed cornice. The building corners have wooden block quoining, and eaves--like those of the cupola--adorned with an elaborated bracketed cornice. The house's Nahant Street facade is three bays wide, with single-story projecting bays flanking a center entrance. The entrance is sheltered by an elaborate porch, which is joined to the roofs of the flanking bays and topped by a third projecting bay. Dormers with elaborate window-surrounds encompass round-arch windows, the center of which has a double window and is recessed. The Ocean Street facade of the house has a similar plan and decoration, but its ground- floor bays are rectangular, and its three roof dormers identical. The house was built in 1866 for Lucian Newhall (born October 14, 1824, died May 17 1898), a descendant of early Lynn settlers. Newhall was one of the first local businessmen to establish a shoe factory in the city's Central Business District (in 1847), and remained in the shoe business until 1875. Newhall's house is one of the most visually prominent in the Diamond District. Notes A common mis-spelling of \\"Lucian\\" is as \\"Lucien\\".

The house contains a rare instance of preserved 17th century decoration. Like many First Period houses, it was built in stages. The first part, the now-central chimney and right-side two stories, was built c. 1658, with the left-side rooms being added c. 1695‚Äì96. The fireplace in the right- side room contains original detailing that was covered over by paneling sometime in the 18th century, and the trim on the staircase to the second floor was probably added at the time of the addition. There have been several later additions to the house. A leanto section was added to the rear in the 18th century, and single story wings were added to either side in the 19th century. The interior was also partially redecorated in the 19th century, giving the left side front room some Greek Revival character. In the early 20th century the house underwent a major restoration, in which the left side front room was opened up to the leanto section, creating a large living space. The first documented owner of the house (and for whom it may have been built) was the Rev. Antipas Newman, who married Elizabeth, the daughter of John Winthrop the Younger. The modifications in the 1690s were probably made by William Fiske, Jr. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

It is centered on the North Canal and the Great Stone Dam, which provided the waterpower for its many mill complexes. The canal was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, while the district was first listed in 1984, and then expanded slightly in 2009. The city of Lawrence was founded by industrialist Abbott Lawrence and the associates of the Essex Company as a model industrial city. In 1845 they company acquired land from then towns of Methuen and Andover and began construction on the North Canal and the Great Stone Dam. The work included dredging and building out of \\"new land\\", and effectively created a small island between the Merrimack River and the canal, whose outlet is at the mouth of the Spicket River. Work on these two major features was completed in 1848, and development of the city, which formally incorporated in 1853, proceeded from there. The historic district encompasses, in addition to the canal and the dam, the mill-related buildings on the island and on the north side of the canal, as well as a few buildings that front on Methuen and Union Streets, or the connecting side streets. The 2009 expansion of the district, included a single building, the Morehouse Bakery building at 5-9 Mill Street. Canal and Great Stone Dam The Great Stone Dam was constructed across the Merrimack River at a place called Bodwell's Falls, where there is a five-foot drop. The dam was built to raise the height of the drop to . It is made of granite blocks laid on a bed of hydraulic cement. At its base it is thick, shrinking to at its top. It has three sections: the central span is , a south wing directs flow to the South Canal, and a wing directs water into the North Canal. It has a gatehouse, from which 24 gates in its sluiceway were controlled before the controls were electrified. Nearby on the island are also the surviving gatekeeper's house, an 1845 Greek Revival wood frame structure, and a c. 1860s barn. The North Canal runs parallel to the Merrimack River, and is long. It ranges in width from at its upper end to where its wasteway joins the Spicket River. The canal is trapezoidal in its cross-section, with walls lined by granite, and a bottom made of granite rubble that has been sealed with clay. It is capable of delivering 4,000 cubic feet of water per second; water power is still used in some of the mills lining its banks. The canal used to have operable locks for navigation; the upper ones were removed and the lower ones were filled in. Mill complexes The Pacific Mills complex is an extensive array of buildings in the western (upper) and central parts of the district. The oldest standing building, a storehouse, dates to 1860, and there are remnants of an earlier 1852 structure. One of the more impressive structures is the Weave Shed built in 1890; it is a two-story brick building long. Its main cotton complex comprises five buildings on the north side of the canal. In the central part of the district the Pacific Mills include buildings in which both cotton and worsted wool products were manufactured. The Atlantic Mill Company buildings stand next to those of the Pacific Mills in the upper portion of the island. Only two notable buildings survive, the c. 1906 spinning mill, and a boarding house (one of two such buildings to survive in the district) that dates to 1847 and is the only surviving remnant of what was once a much more extensive housing district. The central portion of the district includes mill buildings from a number of manufacturers, including the Bay State Woolens Company (whose c. 1847 brick boarding house is now the visitor center of Lawrence Heritage State Park), the Washington Mills, and buildings of the American Woolen Company and the Pemberton Mill. Other notable buildings here include the Essex Company Offices and Yard (separately listed on the National Register). The lower portion of the district is predominantly occupied by the mill complexes of the Everett Mills and the Kuhnhardt Woolen Mills.

It is notable as one of the oldest houses in Gloucester, and for its association with Alpheus Hyatt, who did research in marine biology here before establishing the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. The oldest part of the house is estimated to have been built in 1664 for Francis Norwood, a mariner and early settler of Gloucester. It remained in the hands of Norwood family descendants until 1879, when Cape Ann Bank took the house by foreclosure. It was acquired that year by Audella Hyatt, wife of Alpheus Hyatt. In 1880 Hyatt used the property as a base for marine research, but abandoned that use, finding it unsuitable, after one season. It was owned by descendants of the Hyatts until 1987. The construction history of the house has not been researched in detail. It is a 2.5-story wood frame structure, with its earliest framing members showing evidence of 17th century construction methods. It was repeatedly expanded, particularly during the Norwood family's ownership, to reach its present configuration. The main block of the house is five window bays wide, and there is a two-story ell added on to the west side (probably in the early 19th century), and several shed-style additions on the northwest part of the house. The foundation is mainly mortared stone, but the eastern wall is made of brick. The interior of the house has significant features that remain from the 17th and 18th centuries. Many original fireplaces and mantels survive, although most of the fireplaces have been covered over. There are wide pine floors, and the walls and woodwork show many examples of 18th and 19th century construction techniques. Many of the walls were painted with artwork, largely by Audella Hyatt.

He worked mainly in poster art, but was also active as a painter, book illustrator and theatre designer.  Life  Edward McKnight Kauffer (1937) Photo Carl Van Vechten Edward Leland Kauffer was born on 14 December 1890, in Great Falls, Montana. By 1910 he had moved to San Francisco working as a bookseller and studying art at the California School of Design from 1910 to 1912. At around this time Professor Joseph McKnight of the University of Utah became aware of Kauffer's work, sponsored him and paid to send him to Paris for further study. In gratitude Kauffer took his sponsor's name as a middle name. Kauffer stopped in Chicago for six months in 1912/1913 and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. While there he witnessed the Armory Show, one of the first major exhibitions to introduce the styles of modernism to American viewers. This likely had a major impact on Kauffer, who would work in many of the same styles throughout his career. He arrived in Paris in 1913 and studied at the Acad√©mie Moderne until 1914. In Paris in 1923 he met the textile designer Marion Dorn (1896‚Äì1964), and subsequently lived with her in London, from late 1923 to July 1940. They married in 1950 and moved to New York until his death in 1954.

The mural consisted of \\"monochrome photographs ... printed directly on to a light-sensitive cellulose coating\\". Kauffer may be best known for the 140 posters that he produced for London Underground, and later London Transport. The posters span many styles: many show abstract influences, including futurism, cubism, and vorticism; others evoke impressionist influences such as Japanese woodcuts.Edward Leland McKnight Kauffer A Dictionary of Modern Design.

Rowland (May 20, 1937 in Fuquay Springs, NC ‚Äì December 28, 2015 in Kansas City, MO) was the fifteenth president of Kansas City Southern Railway and a Kansas City philanthropist. As a child, his family moved to Portsmouth, VA during World War II, then to Wilmington, DE when he was 13, after his father died. He started working after school around this time, which would impact his life in two important ways: he was exposed to the asbestos that ultimately would cause his death from cancer, but his family's struggles also gave him the drive to succeed and to be able to take care of others. Rowland graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in English Literature, then from Harvard Law School with a JD in 1962. He married the former Sarah Fidler in 1959, and they had three children survive infancy: Liza, Matthew, and Joshua. Rowland died on December 28, 2015, aged 78.  Professional life  Rowland joined Watson Ess Marshall and Engass upon graduation, leaving in 1980 to join Kansas City Southern Industries. He was promoted to President and COO of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) in 1983, then served as CEO starting in 1987, retiring as Chairman in 2004. To help the railroad maintain its independence, he was part of the push to diversify the company into the less capital-intensive fields of finance - including the acquisition of Janus in 1984 - and technology - with the establishment of DST as a division to automate mutual fund record keeping. These entities became so successful that between 1995 and 2003, Rowland oversaw splitting KCSI into three public companies: Kansas City Southern (railroad), Janus Capital Group (mutual fund), and DST Systems (financial technology). He continued to build the KCS railway, acquiring four railways and pursuing the acquisition of Mexican railways starting in the early 1990s (before NAFTA in 1994). Despite Mexican government churn, Rowland pushed to maintain involvement, finally culminating in KCS's acquisition of the \\"premier rail line in Mexico\\" in 2005. His CEO predecessor, Irvine Hockaday Jr., later noted that \\"[Rowland] and the leadership of the railroad subsidiary solidified the future of that railroad by its extension into Mexico, which in turn stabilized the future of Kansas City Southern to the benefit of the city.\\" In 2005, after his retirement from KCS, Rowland and his wife Sarah purchased a small Garden City, MO bank, which later became Lead Bank. Sarah Rowland currently serves as Lead Bank's Board Chairman, while their son, Joshua C. Rowland, serves as CEO and Vice Chairman. At the time of his death, Mr. Rowland was serving as Director and Chairman Emeritus of Janus Capital Group. Rowland was also a Trustee of CED (Committee of Economic Development) where he was given a CED 2011 Distinguished Performance Award. Mr. Rowland was a panel presenter in a CED forum called \\"Hidden Money: The Need for Transparency in Political Finance\\".http://www.nbafinkansas.org/task_force/biographies/LRowland.aspx  Community involvement  Rowland was Board Chairman of the Swope Ridge Geriatric Center for 25 years. He also chaired the Local Investment Commission (LINC) from 1995‚Äì2014. Regarding his generosity, longtime former executive director of Swope Ridge, Dorothy Fauntleroy, stated, \\"He is one of the most charitable, kind and sensitive human beings I've ever known, but he wants to be anonymous... People do not know the depth of his giving to the needy and disadvantaged.\\" In discussing his own involvement in social services work, Rowland insisted, \\"It is so much easier to go out and raise money for our own special interests... I want to find the process - and help with the process - that bridges the gaps and helps us look beyond the temptation to go our separate ways. That is a task for any citizen, anywhere in the country. It is not limited to Kansas City.\\" Landon and Sarah Rowland have been arts supporters and patrons, including Rowland's leadership roles in the Lyric Opera and the Metropolitan Performing Arts fund, as well support for the Kansas City Ballet, the Kansas City Symphony, the Harriman-Jewell Series, and the Friends of Chamber Music. They have also been great supporters of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, including the 2002 creation of the Ever Glades Fund for American Art. Rowland was involved with the founding of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (working with baseball legend Buck O'Neill), and served in leadership roles with the Linda Hall Library, the Liberty Memorial Association, and the National World War I Museum. He was also involved nationally in the Committee for Economic Development and Business Executives for National Security. As part of his involvement in LINC, Rowland was involved in the sale of Kansas City's charity care hospitals to HCA Midwest Health, with the sale proceeds going to a foundation to provide health care access to the disadvantaged in Kansas City. After HCA fell short of its commitments, Rowland pushed for the Health Care Foundation to sue HCA, resulting in a $433 million award (later settled at $175 million). Landon and Sarah Rowland bought a historic farm (\\"Ever Glades Farm\\") in Clay County (MO) in 1986, where they have pursued Sarah's interest in breeding and raising American Saddlebred Horses. Through their involvement, Landon became Chairman and a lifetime director of the American Royal. References * Kansas City Southern Historical Society, The Kansas City Southern Lines.
