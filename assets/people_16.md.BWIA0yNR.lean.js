He is known primarily for his longtime association with the Beverly Hills Playhouse, a Los Angeles-based acting school. His older brother, Fred Barton, is a New York-based pianist and composer. His father, David K. Barton, is a radar-systems engineer. His cousin was jazz saxophonist Paul Desmond. Career=Beverly Hills Playhouse After graduating from Harvard University in 1990, Barton relocated to Los Angeles and began his studies as an actor at the Beverly Hills Playhouse (BHP). Over the next 18 years, he completed apprenticeships as a director and teacher under Milton Katselas, BHP's founder. Simultaneously with his artistic training, he began working part-time for BHP in 1993, rapidly ascending to become CFO in 1997 and then the school's youngest ever CEO in 2003. He began teaching for BHP in 2002, had a class under his own name in 2005, and taught alongside Katselas starting in 2007 up until Katselas' death in October 2008. Katselas bequeathed BHP ownership to Barton, who still teaches at the school and oversees its operations, including expansion to both New York and San Francisco. He started the BHPs free-theatre concept, Project X, which presents free performances of established plays acted by BHP students. In 2017, Barton released his book ‚ÄúThe Oasis of Insanity,‚Äù which is a memoir of his unique apprenticeship with Katselas, as well as a guidebook to the study and pursuit of acting in the 21st century. Barton continues to maintain a blog for the BHP under the same name: The Oasis of Insanity. Writing Barton‚Äôs first play ENGAGEMENT was produced by the Skylight Theatre Company in Los Angeles in 2010, and was mounted as well in San Francisco in 2014. His second play, YEARS TO THE DAY (2013) received significant critical acclaim, with his writing compared to that of Albee, Mamet and George Bernard Shaw. Years to the Day was nominated in writing and acting categories by the LA Drama Critics Circle and the LA Weekly, and was one of the latter‚Äôs Ten Best Plays of 2013. It was performed in Paris in October, 2013, and also participated in the 59E59 St. Theatre‚Äôs ‚ÄúEast To Edinburgh‚Äù Festival in June, 2014 on its way to a run at the 2014 Edinburgh Theatre Festival, and has since been performed in Kansas City, San Francisco, Ontario, with productions scheduled for Memphis as well as Adelaide, Australia. Barton‚Äôs third play, DISCONNECTION, had two successful Los Angeles runs in 2015. His most recent play, CIRCLING, is currently in the pipeline for an equity production in the 2018-2019 season. Directing As a director, Barton has helmed the following Los Angeles stage productions: ABOUT FAITH (2001), I MAKE YOU LAUGHING (2004), PINK DOT (2005), BURN THIS (2006), THE LAST FIVE YEARS (2007), RABBIT HOLE (2008), THE REAL THING (2009), ENGAGEMENT (2010), and Project X presentations of THE HEIDI CHRONICLES (2012), OLEANNA (2013), SPEED-THE-PLOW (2014), and GRUESOME PLAYGROUND INJURIES (2016). Piano As a classical pianist, Barton studied with Seth Kimmelman at New England Conservatory, and in Los Angeles with Bernardo Segall, Deborah Aitken and Mario Feninger. He was a prize-winner in the 2002 Los Angeles Liszt Society Competition, and has performed annual recitals in Los Angeles, New York, Boston and the New England area.

Barton married Tiffany Yu in 2003, and they have three children. In the mid-late 1990s, Barton was associated with Scientology, and acted in many of their in-house films under the Golden Era Productions banner. His last course completion was in 2000, and he appears to have had no activity with the group since then. In 2012, he became more of an outspoken critic, as he took on the movement's \\"disconnection\\" policy, which affected Milton Katselas during his life and came to interfere with Barton's own relationship with his piano teacher Mario Feninger. He was interviewed in 2012 for Lawrence Wright's book about Scientology, \\"Going Clear.\\"  References  External links  * * Beverly Hills Playhouse - Allen Barton's Teacher Page * Oasis of Insanity: The Study and Pursuit of Acting Blog by Allen Barton * Oasis of Insanity: The Study & Pursuit of Acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse book Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Male actors from Los Angeles Category:American classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:American male pianists Category:20th-century American dramatists and playwrights Category:Former Scientologists Category:Harvard University alumni Category:People from Lexington, Massachusetts Category:American chief executives Category:American chief financial officers Category:20th-century American pianists ","title":"Allen Barton"},{"id":"29644522","text":"Linguistic rights in Europe are stated in constitutions which differ by country.

Also, the light plastic shell cuts down on damage to other objects when the ball hits them, making them good for recreation in urban and suburban areas. Because they have very thin plastic shells, they break easily. Also their low mass lets them be carried by the wind, making them potentially irretrievable. Other uses Air flow balls can also be used in golf practice, when they are roughly the size of a golf ball, but the harder they are hit, the more drag is created, so they are safe for golf training at home.

It was released in 1971 on SGC Records. Songwriter/guitarist Todd Rundgren recorded the album but left the band prior to its release. The band disbanded the following year. Background The songs on the album consisted of tracks recorded in late 1968 and early 1969 for an intended double album, to be titled Fungo Bat. When a single album (Nazz Nazz) was released instead, an album's worth of tracks remained unreleased. Drummer Thom Mooney, who retained possession of the master tapes, was contacted by SGC Records in 1970 and was coerced into allowing the label to listen to the material. Mooney was unaware that the label's intention was to use the recordings for a possible third album in order to capitalize on former Nazz member Rundgren's burgeoning solo career. The label released Nazz III following the release of Rundgren's second solo album, Runt.

At least sixteen American settlers were killed during the period.Browne, pg. 195‚Äì202. Massacres Mowry, Arizona in 1864 by John Browne. A grave along the trail to Mowry, a victim of an Apache ambush. The former United States Army lieutenant, Sylvester Mowry, purchased the Patagonia mine in 1860 from a party of Mexicans. Soon after, Mowry began operating the mine and attracted miners to the area for work. The Chiricahua and other Apache bands were also attracted though, and they considered the Santa Rita Mountains to be sacred ground and they defended it accordingly by raiding and ambushing settlers. As the American Civil War began, United States Army troops were withdrawn from the frontier of Arizona to fight the Confederates in the South. This left the settlers unprotected and vulnerable to attack, even after Union troops from California arrived. Writer and explorer John Ross Browne visited the area in early 1864 and he described the situation in his book; Adventures in the Apache Country. According to Browne, early in the morning on December 29, of 1863, two young men named J.B. Mills and Edwin Stevens, were traveling on the trail to the Mowry Mine, both were employees of Sylvester Mowry. The pair were about four miles away from the settlement when they were attacked by the Apaches hiding in the bushes at the entrance of a canyon in which the trail runs through. Several shots were fired in rapid succession and Stevens was killed and fell off his horse. Mills was armed so he fought the Apache until bleeding to death from his wounds. There were witnesses to the massacre, two young Mexican boys were traveling nearby and discovered Apache tracks. Just after they saw Mills and Stevens riding to the entrance of the canyon. The boys suspected an attack so they shouted \\"Los Apaches\\" at the riders but they did not hear. John R. Browne visited the canyon thirty-one days after the attack, he reported that signs of struggle were still visible, broken arrows were found lying on the path, some of them bloodied. In Browne's account both men were badly mutilated, Stevens was pierced with a spear many times after his death and Mills' body revealed seventeen separate wounds from arrows, musket balls and the spear. After hearing the massacre, the boys turned around and rushed back to Mowry where a four-man posse was formed and sent to the canyon within minutes but by that time it was already to late and the Apaches had escaped. John Browne also described a second massacre at the same site, almost two years later in 1865. A doctor named Titus who lived and worked at the Mowry Mine was killed at the canyon along with a Delaware Native American who was guiding him. The guide was killed at the first volley of muskets and arrows which left Titus alone so he dismounted from his horse and fought his way 200 yards through the canyon until being shot from a hidden native in the hip with an arrow. The doctor fell to the ground and instead of being hung from a tree and burned alive, which was a usual Apache method of torture, Titus shot himself in the head with his revolver. The Apache chief who was present spared the doctor's body from mutilation because he had shown incredible bravery in the fight. Browne also wrote that at Mowry, of the seventeen plots in the graveyard, fifteen of the dead were victims of Apache attacks while only two died of natural causes. Sylvester Mowry was arrested during this period by the Union General James H. Carleton. He was charged with selling lead to rebels but was later released after convincing his judge that he was only aiding fellow settlers in their defense against the natives. The mining town itself was eventually destroyed by the Apache but was later repopulated.

These compounds are molecular, i.e. discrete in contrast to the polymeric, dense nitride materials that are useful in materials science. The distinction between the molecular and solid-state polymers is not always very clear as illustrated by the materials Li6MoN4 and more condensed derivatives such as Na3MoN3. Transition metal nitrido complexes have attracted interest in part because it is assumed that nitrogen fixation proceeds via nitrido intermediates. Nitrido complexes have long been known, the first example being salts of [OsO3N]‚àí, described in the 19th century. Structural trends Mononuclear complexes feature terminal nitride ligands, typically with short M-N distances consistent with metal ligand multiple bonds. For example, in the anion in PPh4[MoNCl4], the Mo-N distance is 163.7 pm. The occurrence of terminal nitrido ligands follow the patterns seen for oxo complexes: they are more common for early and heavier metals. Many bi- and polynuclear complexes are known with bridging nitrido ligands. More exotic metal nitrido complexes are also possible, such as a recently reported compound containing a terminal uranium nitride (-U‚â°N) bond. File:OsNO3_anion.png[OsNO3]‚àí, which is isoelectronic with osmium tetroxide. File:MoNCl4_anion.png[MoNCl4]‚àí, a square pyramidal Mo(VI) complex. File:W2NCl10_anion.png[W2(Œº-N)Cl10]‚àí, containing two W(VI) centres bridged by a nitrido ligand. File:Ir3N(SO4)6aq3.png[Ir3N(SO4)6(H2O)3]4‚àí, structurally related to basic iron acetate. File:Uranium_nitride_anion.pngA uranium nitrido complex. File:Cp\\"2Fe2N2.png((t-Bu)3C5H2)2Fe2N2. Preparative routes Metal nitrides are produced using a variety of nitrogen sources. The first example was prepared from amide (NH2‚àí) as the N3‚àí source: :OsO4 \\\\+ KNH2 ‚Üí KOsO3N + H2O Most commonly however, nitrido complexes are produced from azido complexes.. The driving force for these reactions is the great stability of N2. Nitrogen trichloride is an effective reagent to give chloro-nitrido complexes. In some cases, even N2 and nitriles can serve as sources of nitride ligands. Reactions of nitrido ligands The nitride ligand can be both electrophilic and nucleophilic. Terminal nitrides of early metals tend to be basic and oxidizable, whereas nitrides of the later metals tend to be oxidizing and electrophilic. The former behavior is illustrated by their N-protonation and N-alkylation. Ru and Os nitrido complexes often add organophosphines to give iminophosphine derivatives containing the R3PN‚àí ligand. Interstitial nitrides Owing to the ability of nitrido ligands to serve as a bridging ligand, several metal clusters are known to contain nitride ligands at their center. Such nitrido ligands are termed interstitial. In some cases, the nitride is completely encased in the center of six or more metals and cannot undergo reactions, although it contributes to the intermetallic bonding. This series is known for M = Fe(CO)3.

It is themed after a canal race through Roman ruins and leaves riders fully soaked after the ride. Ride experience Once riders board the six-passenger raft, the moving platform the raft shortly bonds to releases its grips and sends the raft spinning off, slowly at first but reaching quick speeds at points. At first, riders are teased into thinking the ride is calm, but it soon picks up when water jets shoot water opposite the direction of the current, causing white water and rapids. After barely avoiding being drenched by a statue fountain, the raft spins by a balcony with twenty-five cent machines that activate water squirters that try to wet riders. After sliding down a short drop, the raft then races to a pool, keeping the raft on-track only by column ruins that look too far apart. Next, rapids carry the raft towards four large waterfalls which are almost impossible to not be drenched from. Passengers are then taken up a hill to be returned to the boarding platform. Due to the unpredictability of the rapids and the chain movement patterns at the station, riders will rarely go through the same experience on the ride twice (i.e. one person catching all 3 waterfalls at the end on one ride and the same person catching none the next time they ride).

He was the son of Constans II and Fausta, who was elevated in 659, before his father departed for Italy. After the death of Constans, Tiberius' brother Constantine IV, ascended the throne as senior emperor. Constantine attempted to have both Tiberius and Heraclius removed as co-emperors, which sparked a popular revolt, in 681. Constantine ended the revolt by promising to accede to the demands of the rebels, sending them home, but bringing their leaders into Constantinople. Once there, Constantine had them executed, then imprisoned Tiberius and Heraclius and had them mutilated, after which point they disappear from history. Life Tiberius was the youngest son of Constans II. His mother was Fausta, daughter of the Patrician Valentinus. Although his eldest brother Constantine IV had been raised to the rank of co-emperor in 654, in 659, shortly before his father's departure for Italy, Tiberius was also elevated by Constans to the rank of co-emperor, alongside his older brother Heraclius. In 663, Constans tried to have his sons join him in Sicily, but this provoked a popular uprising in Constantinople, led by Theodore of Koloneia and Andrew, and the brothers remained in the imperial capital. With Constans II's death in 668, Constantine IV became the senior emperor. After ruling alongside Tiberius and Heraclius for thirteen years, Constantine attempted to demote his brothers from the imperial position, but this provoked a military revolt in the Anatolic Theme (in modern Turkey). The army marched to Chrysopolis, and sent a delegation across the straits of the Hellespont to Constantinople, demanding that the two brothers should remain co-emperors alongside Constantine IV. They based their demand on the belief that, since Heaven was ruled by the Trinity, in the same way the empire should be governed by three Emperors. Confronted by this situation, Constantine kept a close eye on his brothers, and sent across a trusted officer, Theodore, the captain of Koloneia. Constantine gave Theodore the delicate task of praising the soldiers for their devotion and agreeing with their reasoning, with the objective of persuading them to return to their barracks in Anatolia. He also invited the leaders of the rebellion to come over to Constantinople and consult with the Senate in order that they may begin the process of confirming the army's wishes. Happy with this apparently positive outcome, the army departed back to Anatolia, while the instigators of the movement entered the city. With the military threat now gone, Constantine moved against the leaders of the revolt, captured them and had them hanged at Sycae. Because he was the focus of a plot to curtail Constantine's power, both he and his brother were now suspect in the senior emperor's eyes; also, the emperor was keen to raise up his own son, the future Justinian II. Sometime between 16 September and 21 December 681, Constantine ordered the mutilation of his brothers by slitting their noses, and ordered that their images no longer appear on any coinage, and that their names be removed from all official documentation; likely to ensure that his son, Justinian II would, succeed him. After this point, neither are mentioned again by history.

He hosts the talk radio program Focal Point on American Family Radio and posts on the AFA-run blog Instant Analysis (formerly Rightly Concerned). Fischer opposes abortion, national health care, gay adoption, civil unions, and same-sex marriage. Fischer's comments about homosexuality caused the AFA to be designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in November 2010. To avoid being classified as a hate group, the AFA has officially repudiated Fischer's views on Muslims, Native Americans, Hispanics, and African Americans, as well his claims that the Holocaust was caused by homosexuals, that homosexuality should be outlawed, and that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian. Biography Fischer, born in Oklahoma City and later raised in Fresno, California, has an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Stanford University, and holds a graduate degree in theology from Dallas Theological Seminary. Fischer served at the Cole Community Church in Boise, Idaho and founded the Cole Center for biblical studies and was the church's director for thirteen years. Fischer then founded Community Church of the Valley and was a senior pastor for twelve years. In 2004, he co-founded the Keep the Commandments Coalition, a group dedicated to keeping a Ten Commandments monument in Julia Davis Park in Boise. From 2000 to 2005, he served as a commissioner for the city's Park and Recreation Department. Fischer joined the American Family Association in 2009. Views and activities=Minorities Fischer has said that welfare has \\"destroyed the African-American family\\" by \\"offering financial rewards to women who have more children out of wedlock\\" thereby incentivizing \\"fornication rather than marriage\\" creating \\"disastrous social consequences of people who rut like rabbits.\\" The AFA has repudiated the characterisation of minorities as \\"people who rut like rabbits,\\" as well as the view that immigration should be restricted because Hispanics are \\"socialist by nature\\" and vote Democratic because it allows them to \\"benefit from the plunder of the wealth of the United States.\\" Fischer has argued that \\"many of the tribal reservations today remain mired in poverty and alcoholism because many Native Americans continue to cling to the darkness of indigenous superstition instead of coming into the light of Christianity and assimilating into Christian culture.\\" The AFA has repudiated his view that \\"Superstition, savagery and sexual immorality\\" morally disqualified Native Americans from \\"sovereign control of American soil.\\" Religious exercise Fischer has said that Muslim students coming to US campuses are setting up Muslim Students' Associations, whose \\"agenda is dedicated to destroy the host country\\" and compared them to parasites, adding \\"these university campuses are dangerous places for Islamic extremism\\". According to him, the only shot at building a democracy in an Islamic land is a mass conversion of its people to Christianity, for which he suggests sending missionaries \\"right after we send in the Marines to neutralize whatever threat has been raised against the United States\\". He suggests \\"returning with lethal force if the forces in your country threaten us again. He has stated that Muslims are worshipping a demon, and \\"every time we allow a mosque to go up in one of our communities, it's like planting an improvised explosive device right in the heart of your city and we have no idea when one of these devices is going to go off.\\"As quoted by He stated that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects only the religious practice of Christianity, writing in a blog post \\"the real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance [Islam], or Judaism, or infidelity... so the purpose of the First Amendment was most decidedly NOT to \\"approve, support, (or) accept\\" any \\"religion\\" other than Christianity.\\" Fischer has suggested Jews and Muslims are not included in religious freedom protections in the US, saying: \\"I have contended for years that the First Amendment, as given by the Founders, provides religious liberty protections for Christianity only.\\" He later wrote: \\"We are a Christian nation and not a Jewish or Muslim one.\\" He affirmed this belief as well in a 2018 article regarding the First Amendment rights of prisoners to practice their religion under federal law, stating that \\"religions other than Christianity have no First Amendment rights whatsoever under the federal constitution.\\" MormonVoices, a group associated with Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research, included Fischer on its Top Ten Anti-Mormon Statements of 2011 list for saying \\"Mormonism is not an orthodox Christian faith. It just is not ... It's very clear that the founding fathers did not intend to preserve automatically religious liberty for non-Christian faiths.\\" In a 2015 press release denouncing Fischer's views, the AFA stated \\"AFA rejects the idea expressed by Bryan Fischer that 'free exercise of religion' only applies to Christians. Consequently, AFA rejects Bryan's assertions that Muslims should not be granted permits to build mosques in the United States.\\" In 2018 he wrote about the \\"dangerous trend\\" of Muslims running for political office in the United States, calling Islam a \\"scourge\\" and \\"the Ebola virus of culture\\". He further called for states to institute religious tests for those in or running for office, citing examples from some states effective during the late 18th century. Homosexuality and Nazism Fischer believes that homosexuality is \\"immoral, unnatural, and unhealthy\\". In 2007, Fischer hosted an event with former American Family Association California leader Scott LivelyAFA Action Alert June 2001 Scott Lively, an attorney and president of Abiding Truth Ministries, began serving as the California state director for AFA in early April. ' to promote the view that \\"homosexuality was at the heart of Nazism,\\" a claim which is rejected by historians. In May 2010, Fischer wrote a blog post on the AFA website and RenewAmerica detailing purported allegations that Adolf Hitler was a homosexual, that \\"the Nazi Party began in a gay bar in Munich,\\" and concluded by claiming that the Holocaust (which actually included gay victims of Nazi persecution) was caused by homosexuals in the Nazi German military: \\"Nazi Germany became the horror that it was because it rejected both Christianity and its clear teaching about human sexuality.\\" On American Family Talk radio, Fischer repeated the claim that Hitler was a homosexual, and stated that Hitler recruited homosexuals to be storm troopers, because \\"homosexual soldiers basically had no limits and the savagery and brutality they were willing to inflict\\". In April 2013, Fischer claimed that \\"Homofascists\\" will treat Christians like Jews in the Holocaust and later that year he repeated on American Family Talk that Hitler started the Nazi party \\"in a gay bar in Munich\\" and that \\"[Adolf Hitler] couldn't get straights to be vicious enough in being his enforcers.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center, through its Teaching Tolerance program, has encouraged schools across the U.S. to hold a \\"Mix It Up at Lunch\\" day in order to encourage students to break up cliques and prevent bullying. In late 2012, the AFA called the project ‚Äì begun 11 years earlier and held in more than 2,500 schools ‚Äì \\"a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools\\", urging parents to keep their children home from school on October 30, 2012, and to call the schools to protest the event. \\"I was surprised that they completely lied about what Mix It Up Day is\\", Maureen Costello, the director of the center's Teaching Tolerance project, which organizes the program, told The New York Times. \\"It was a cynical, fear-mongering tactic.\\" In October, Fischer was taken off air during a CNN interview with Carol Costello for repeating his belief that \\"Hitler recruited homosexuals around him to make up his Stormtroopers\\". In 2012, as jury selection was to begin in a trial on charges of kidnapping of a lesbian couple's daughter, Fischer wrote on Twitter in support of kidnapping of children from same-sex households and smuggling them to what he calls \\"normal\\" homes.Edwards, David (August 8, 2012). \\"Fischer calls for 'Underground Railroad' to kidnap children of LGBT parents\\" .

Right Wing Watch. Retrieved August 9, 2012. In January 2013, he compared consensual sex between people of the same gender to pedophilia, incest and bestiality. In January 2013, Fischer compared the Boy Scouts of America's change in views on gay scouts and scoutmasters to Jerry Sandusky, saying allowing gay scoutmasters was inviting pedophiles into the tents of children. In March 2013, Fischer compared homosexuality to bank robbery when Senator Portman announced his views on same-sex marriage had changed due to having a gay son. Fischer also stated that homosexuality should be banned like trans fats for being \\"a hazard to human health\\" and likened homosexuals to thieves, murderers and child molesters. On January 28, 2015, Tim Wildmon, President of the American Family Association demoted Fischer from being a spokesperson. Fischer went on to state that he will still be hosting the AFA's American Family Talk radio. In order to avoid being categorised as a hate group by Israel, The AFA issued a press release denouncing some of Fischer's views, rejecting his claim that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian, and stating \\"AFA rejects the statement by Bryan Fischer that, \\"Homosexuality gave us Adolph Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews.\\" AFA rejects the policy advocated by Bryan Fischer that homosexual conduct should be illegal. AFA rejects the notion advocated by Bryan Fischer that, \\"We need an underground railroad to protect innocent children from same-sex households.\\" When the Supreme Court ruled on Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015, Fischer described it as an \\"a date which will live in infamy\\", tweeting that \\"6/26 is now our 9/11\\" and \\"the day the twin towers of truth and righteousness were blown up by moral jihadists.\\" Fischer described the Supreme Court justices who voted to legalize same-sex marriage as \\"rainbow jihadists and they blasted the twin pillars\\" and described social conservatives as \\"serfs on a plantation that's being run by cultural elites who wear black robes and use their gavels like the slaveholders of old used to use their whips.\\" Activities In November 2010, the SPLC changed their listing of the AFA from a group that used hate speech to the more serious one of being designated a hate group. Although these claims have not been confirmed by another group besides SPLC. The SPLC's Mark Potok said that the AFA's \\"propagation of known falsehoods and demonizing propaganda\\" was the basis for the change. Fischer's anti-gay comments were given as an example by SPLC in support of the hate group designation. The AFA rejected this notion and responded by calling the SPLC \\"the most dangerous hate group in America\\". Fischer has voiced support for the AIDS denial movement. His guest on the January 3, 2012, edition of Focal Point was prominent AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg; Fischer strongly supported Duesberg's contention that AIDS is not caused by HIV, but by recreational drug use. from AFA channel from AFA channel In the June 18, 2012 issue of The New Yorker magazine (\\"Bully Pulpit\\"),. author Jane Mayer featured Fischer in an article describing his influence in the Republican Party and 2012 presidential election. On April 20, Fischer attacked Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney's national security spokesman Richard Grenell for being openly gay. Other conservatives joined Fischer in calling for Grenell's ouster, and by May 1 Grenell resigned from the Romney campaign, in what Fischer described as a \\"huge win\\" for conservatives. During the 2012 presidential primaries, Republican Party candidates Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, and Tim Pawlenty were guests on Fischer's show, but Romney was not invited. In the article (the facts of which Mayer says \\"were ... all checked with Fischer, and where he had factual objections, his caveats were included\\"), Mayer also quotes Fischer as saying that President Barack Obama \\"despises the constitution, ... nurtures a hatred for the white man\\", and aims to \\"destroy capitalism\\". Fischer believes that sexual orientation is \\"always a matter of choice\\", and strongly opposes what he calls the \\"morally and intellectually bankrupt theory of evolution\\". On the issue of religion and tax policy, Fischer believes that the progressive income taxes and estate taxes violate the Eighth and Tenth Commandments, because (he feels) by taxing the income and estates of the well-off, the government \\"steals and covets\\" their wealth. In April 2013, Fischer commented on the case of Carla Hale, a lesbian teacher fired from the Catholic school she worked for when her partner was named in her mother's obituary, saying that it was right for the school to fire her based on her \\"immoral sexual behavior\\". He argued that just as shoplifters are discriminated against, society should discriminate against those who engage in other forms of immorality or aberrant sexual behavior. In January 2014, Fischer called the gay weddings at the 2014 Grammy Awards an abomination and said that same-sex parenting is a form of child abuse. The following month, Fischer, in comments about an Arizona bill that would have allowed businesses asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay and lesbian customers, referred to those opposing the bill as \\"jack-booted homo-fascist thugs, who want to use the totalitarian and tyrannical power of the state to send men of faith to jail. That sounds far more like Nazi Germany than the United States of America.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Biography of Bryan Fischer at the American Family Association (archived) Category:American male bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:American evangelicals Category:American Family Association Category:Christian fundamentalists Category:Critics of Islam Category:HIV/AIDS denialists Category:Tax resistance in the United States Category:New Right (United States) Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Living people Category:Writers of blogs about home and family Category:1951 births Category:People from Boise, Idaho Category:American talk radio hosts Category:People from Mississippi Category:People from Oklahoma Category:Oklahoma Republicans Category:Critics of Mormonism Category:Idaho Republicans Category:Mississippi Republicans Category:American anti-abortion activists Category:American social commentators Category:American political commentators Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers ","title":"Bryan Fischer"},{"id":"29645133","text":"Lane's Island is an island which is part of the town of Vinalhaven in Knox County, Maine.

Common trees of the Sierra de Luquillo include Cyathea arborea, Prestoea acuminata, Cecropia peltata, and Ocotea species. Weinmannia pinnata, Brunellia comocladifolia, and Podocarpus coriaceus are found in the cloud forests of the highest peaks. Fauna Puerto Rican moist forests are home to a variety of endemic animal species such as the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata) and coqu√≠s (Eleutherodactylus spp.). Limestone forests are rich in land snail diversity, with many species restricted to small areas. Ecological processes As with most mountainous areas, the forest types change with elevation, exposure and rock type. Superimposed upon these physical factors are forms of natural disturbance such as landslides and hurricanes that allow light-demanding plant species to regenerate. A study in the Luqillo Mountains found that between 1936 and 1988, there were 46 landslides associated with heavy rain, and these created gaps that allowed ferns such as Dicranopteris pectitnata to proliferate. Conservation and protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 406 km¬≤, or 5%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Forty-two percent of the unprotected area is still forested.

Requirements At its base level well-formed documents require that: * Content be defined. * Content be delimited with a beginning and end tag * Content be properly nested (parents within roots, children within parents) To be a well-formed document, rules must be established about the declaration and treatment of entities. Tags are case sensitive, with attributes delimited with quotation marks. Empty elements have rules established. Overlapping tags invalidate a document. Ideally, a well- formed document conforms to the design goals of XML. Other key syntax rules provided in the specification include: * It contains only properly encoded legal Unicode characters. * None of the special syntax characters such as \`<\` and \`&\` appear except when performing their markup-delineation roles. * The begin, end, and empty-element tags that delimit the elements are correctly nested, with none missing and none overlapping. * The element tags are case- sensitive; the beginning and end tags must match exactly. Tag names cannot contain any of the characters \`!\\"#$%&'()*+,/;<=>?@[\\\\]^\`{}~\`, nor a space character, and cannot start with \`-\`, \`.\`, or a numeric digit. * There is a single \\"root\\" element that contains all the other elements. A valid XML document is defined in the XML specification as a well-formed XML document which also conforms to the rules of a Document Type Definition (DTD). According to JavaCommerce.com XML tutorial, \\"Well formed XML documents simply markup pages with descriptive tags. You don't need to describe or explain what these tags mean. In other words a well formed XML document does not need a DTD, but it must conform to the XML syntax rules. If all tags in a document are correctly formed and follow XML guidelines, then a document is considered as well formed.\\" An XML processor that encounters a violation of the well- formedness rules is required to report such errors and to cease normal processing. This policy, occasionally referred to as draconian,\\"Dracon and Postel\\", 2003/08/19, Tim Bray stands in notable contrast to the behavior of programs that process HTML, which are designed to produce a reasonable result even in the presence of severe markup errors in the spirit of Postel's law (\\"Be conservative in what you send; be liberal in what you accept\\").\\"Postel‚Äôs Law Has No Exceptions\\", August 18, 2003 Aaron Swartz Importance The concept of a well-formed document allows for a better understanding of the fundamental construction of XML. It helps to clarify XML beyond the typical sense of it. For example, while most XML Document Type Definitions utilize left and right angle brackets as content delimiters, strictly speaking this is not a necessity (though a delimiter should be terse and concise). The left and right angle bracket codes are a convention, albeit clear and distinctive, not an absolute requirement. The concept of well-formed document also allows for the comprehension of the abstract nature of XML. In reality, there is no such thing as XML. Rather, XML is a principle that represents a set of behaviors and practices. It is possible to discuss types of XML, as expressed within a Document Type Definition (DTD). Well-formed documents also bring into focus the issue of valid versus correct XML. According to the W3 Organization, valid documents are those that validate against a DTD. The rules of validity mean that a document complies with the restraints stated within a DTD. Thus, tags or entities must be in conformity to the rules and relations established within a DTD. However, there is no control on whether a tag or entity is correct. Thus a first level head tag could be applied to a second level head object and be valid, while incorrect. The emphasis on well-formed documents has developed within the publishing industry where the use of left and right angle bracket delimited information has become problematic. Emphasis on the well-formed document allows for the definition, delimiting, and nesting of content to be managed within programs that are not XML, per se, but exhibit the characteristics or potential for being well formed. Validation tools There are several tools available to determine if a given XML document is well formed.

Life=Early life Born in Richmond, Virginia, Athens lived with his parents, Irene and Pete Athens. His early environment is characterized as being violent and Athens was the victim of domestic violence. He was educated at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, where he began by majoring in political science but later changed his major to Sociology and Criminology. After graduating from Virginia Tech, Athens continued his criminology studies at the University of Wisconsin. Career After college Athens continued to interview inmates about their criminal lives and social experiences. He based his study on George Herbert Mead, a philosopher who tried understanding how organisms acquire different traits. Athens focused on the areas of Iowa and California for his interviews. He also worked as a probation and parole officer in northern Virginia in 1986. He took all of his findings and his studies and put them together in the book, The Creation of Dangerous Violent Criminals, in which he discusses his theory and the cases he had to look at along the way. Athens now teaches criminology at Seton Hall University.Rhodes, Richard, Why They Kill; The Discoveries of a Maverick Criminologist, Vintage, 2000, The Process of Violentization Athens developed a theory known as \\"The Process of Violentization\\" which describes four stages in the development of violent actors. Stage 1 Brutalization: Within this stage, the individual engages in violent demeanor through observation and demonstration. This stage is divided into three types of experiences: 1) violent subjugation-personally assaulted or threatened 2) personal horrification-witness others assaulted or threatened 3) violent coaching-taught how to execute violent behavior. Stage 2 Belligerency: In this stage, the subject reinforces his warlike attitude to the situation by a method of different steps. With this repeating behavior they get emotionally attached to what they are doing. Because of this emotional attachment, the individual resorts to violence as a means to control and dominate others any time they are provoked. Stage 3 Violent Performances: After surpassing the previous two stages, the individual executes violent behavior towards subordinates. In this stage, they begin to feel most comfortable with what they are doing because they start to gain respect, celebrity status, and fear from others. ''' Stage 4 Virulency': This stage defines the individual as violent and dangerous in which they use violence to gain control of others, earn respect, instill fear, and make others feel powerless, shamed, and humiliated; feelings that they avoid and no longer feel in themselves. The individual has created a violent self-image for himself/herself. Types of Interpretations Athens explained the four types of interpretations and linked primary emotions related to violence. 1) Physical defensive: Fear based and focus on how a physical attack is or will be made 2) Frustrative: Anger based by which they individual notices resistance and action he/she does not want to execute. 3) Malefic: hate based in which the individual views the negative character of others and utilizes violence as his/her response. 4) Frustrative-Malefic: Hatred and anger based.

Wolf (born August 11, 1957) is an American entrepreneur, aircraft pilot, and politician. In 1989, he founded the Cape Cod-based airline Cape Air, which originally flew between Provincetown and Boston in Massachusetts, and has since expanded internationally. In 2010, he was elected to the Massachusetts Senate to represent the Cape and Islands district. He ran unopposed in 2012, and was subsequently re-elected to a third term in 2014. During his tenure, he has emerged as a progressive leader in the Senate, advocating for renewable energy, increased minimum wage, and universal health care. On June 10, 2013, he announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in the 2014 election. Following an injunction by the State Ethics Commission over his ownership of Cape Air, he announced the suspension of his campaign and his intent to appeal the ruling. Although the Commission eventually ruled in his favor, the nomination process was already well along, and he would eventually run for re-election to the Senate. In 2015, Wolf confirmed that he would not seek a fourth term by running for re-election in 2016. He was succeeded by Julian Cyr (D-Truro). There remains speculation as to whether he will return to focusing on work as owner and pilot for his airline company, although he is considered a potential candidate for Governor in the future. Early life and education Wolf was born on August 11, 1957, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and spent summers in Cape Cod with his family. Wolf attended the Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia, and went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Wesleyan University in 1980. After college he earned a degree in Airframe and Power Plant Maintenance at the Quaker School of Aeronautics. He earned a private and commercial pilot's license while working in Boston as a community and union organizer. In the 1980s he was the manager of the Chatham Municipal Airport and worked as a flight instructor before founding Cape Air in 1988. Cape Air In 1988 Wolf founded the airline company Cape Air, which at the time flew solely between Boston and Provincetown, Massachusetts. Since flying one route with eight employees and one plane, it has expanded to become the largest independent regionally based airline. Cape Air now serves parts of the East Coast, Midwestern United States, the Caribbean, and Micronesia with around 1,000 employees. In 1994, Nantucket Airlines was purchased by and became a subsidiary of Cape Air. Cape Air is an employee-owned company, and the only airline in the United States with a female President. Since being elected to the Massachusetts Senate, Wolf continues to pilot during the summer on weekends. With assistance from a government grant, Cape Air expanded into Indiana on November 13, 2007, offering flights from Indianapolis to Evansville and South Bend. Because it did not get the passengers needed to be financially successful, the last Cape Air flight in Indiana was on August 31, 2008. In September 2010, the United States Department of Transportation's Essential Air Service (EAS) selected Cape Air to fly a federally subsidized route connecting Augusta, Maine and Boston. Service began in December 2010. Massachusetts Senate=Elections Cape Cod is the primary area Wolf represents in the Senate. Wolf testifying before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Dan Wolf in 2013 Then State Senator Dan Wolf speaking to a crowd drumming up support for Congressman Ed Markey in Hyannis in 2013 Following incumbent Robert O'Leary's announcement that he would retire to run for the United States House of Representatives, Wolf declared that he would run to succeed him, one month before the deadline. Wolf expressed his motivation for entering politics because he had \\"become increasingly concerned seeing the challenges through the eyes of [my] front line employees.\\" His campaign set records for fundraising with a war chest of over $300,000, more than either of his opponents. In the Democratic primary Wolf faced and defeated Barnstable County Commissioner Sheila Lyons with nearly twice as many votes. In the general election Wolf defeated Republican real estate developer James H. Crocker Jr. In his 2012 bid for re-election Wolf faced no competition in either a primary or general election. In 2014 Wolf was re-elected to his third term, defeating Republican Ron Beaty in the general election. In October 2015, The Boston Globe first reported that Wolf was considering not running for re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though he said he was more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 to focus on a run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company. Tenure Despite being elected from a relatively conservative district, Wolf has emerged as a liberal and progressive member of the Senate. During his tenure, Wolf has mainly focused on issues such as health care, employee benefits, and middle class economics. An advocate for universal and single-payer health care, Wolf is a supporter of both Massachusetts health care reform and President Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). On July 10, 2012, Wolf testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss the effects of the two laws. Wolf's further statements on the positive aspects of PPACA were eventually cut short by chairman Darrell Issa, a staunch PPACA opponent. Wolf supported a failed amendment in 2012 which would have implemented single-payer health care in Massachusetts if a study proved it was more effective in reducing costs than the state's current model. Wolf has been a consistent supporter of mandated paid sick days for employees, with his company Cape Air offering paid leave for all employees. Wolf, along with Kay Khan in the House of Representatives, introduced the \\"2013 Earned Paid Sick Time\\" bill, which would allow employees to one hour of paid sick leave for every thirty worked. To generate support among other Senators, Wolf went so far as to hold a protest with workers' rights activists at a Dunkin' Donuts frequented by legislators. While advocating for the bill in a committee hearing, Wolf admitted \\"it never occurred to me that there were that many businesses out there that didn't offer this as a benefit,\\" and referred to the experience as \\"an eye-opener.\\" Although the proposal eventually expired without being passed, for reasons Wolf described as a compromise with the legislature having already passed an incremental minimum wage increase, he campaigned for a ballot measure in 2014 which would mandate universal employee sick time. As the Senator for Cape Cod, Wolf supports Cape Wind, a project to build an offshore wind farm in Nantucket Sound. In 2011, Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships praised Wolf's company Cape Air for efficient initiatives such as installing a major solar panel system at their headquarters, expanding office recycling, and distributing compact fluorescent light bulbs to employees. Wolf has been a vocal critic of the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, and published an op-ed piece emphasizing the distinction between people and corporations. Wolf reiterated his opposition to corporate personhood at breakfast event in his campaign for governor, joking: \\"Cape Air and my daughters [are about] the same age... I've never actually confused my daughters for Cape Air.\\" A supporter of adopting a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court decision, Wolf co-sponsored and voted for a resolution to do so. As a guest speaker at a Brookings Institution's summit on Citizens United increase in political spending in 2016, Wolf said a constitutional amendment was vital for changing the political status quo. Consistently voting to increase the minimum wage, in 2014 Wolf supported a bill eventually signed into law which would reform unemployment insurance and increase Massachusetts' minimum wage to $11 an hour by 2017. In 2015, Wolf joined the Fight for $15 and introduced legislation which would raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2018. In doing so, Wolf acknowledged his \\"awkward, interesting place,\\" being that the bill would increase wages of commercial employees at airports higher than his airline company, Cape Air, could pay its employees. Wolf has similarly received criticism for Cape Air's participation in the federal Essential Air Service program, which grants millions of dollars in subsidies to airlines in exchange for flying less-profitable routes considered essential. Committee assignments Wolf serves on the following committees. *Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development (Chair) *Senate Committee on Steering and Policy (Chair) *Joint Committee on Tourism, Arts and Cultural Development *Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy *Joint Committee on Revenue *Joint Committee on Community Development and Small Businesses 2014 gubernatorial campaign On July 10, 2013, Wolf announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in the 2014 election via a YouTube video. At the 2013 Massachusetts Democratic Convention, Wolf was a keynote speaker, along with other declared gubernatorial candidates: Joseph Avellone, and Donald Berwick. Massachusetts Treasurer Steve Grossman also announced his candidacy at the convention. In his campaign, Wolf has focused on his business experience. Wolf has also praised the work of incumbent Governor Deval Patrick and Senator Elizabeth Warren, promising to help grow the middle class. On October 15, Wolf released his case study, The Vision, the Path ‚Äì A Case Study for the Commonwealth, outlining his plans for Massachusetts regarding proposals for education, health care, and other issues. Prior to announcing his campaign for governor, Wolf submitted an inquiry to the Massachusetts Ethics Commission as a precaution there would be no conflict of interest. However, on August 2 the Commission ruled that Wolf's 23% ownership of the company did create a conflict because Cape Air had ongoing contracts with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort); Wolf was instructed he would either need to resign from the Senate and discontinue his campaign from Governor, divest his stake in Cape Air, or cancel all contracts between Cape Air and MassPort. In a statement to supporters, explaining that departing his company or canceling contacts would put his employees' jobs at risk, he announced that he would suspend his campaign, and resign from the Senate. The Ethics Commission later granted his campaign a reprieve, allowing Wolf to make an appeal at their next scheduled meeting on September 19. At the meeting, the Commission ruled 4‚Äì1 to reverse its decision which disqualified him from public office, allowing him to remain in office and renew his candidacy Governor. On October 21, Wolf announced he was ending his campaign for governor, due to the fact that even though the Ethics Commission voted to change its rules, the implementation would have likely taken several months. On June 17, 2014, Wolf endorsed Don Berwick as the Democratic nominee for governor. Personal life Wolf is married to Heidi Schuetz, a chef on Cape Cod, and together they have three daughters: Stella, Zoe, and Ruby. In 2010, Wolf was awarded an honorary doctorate from Daniel Webster College. In March 2013, Wolf was interviewed by New England Cable News (NECN) for their ongoing series \\"The Boss\\", speaking about his life and rise to business and political success. Wolf has been a continuing contributor to the Barnstable Patriot. Wolf has served on a number of boards, including the Advisory Council for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Regional Airline Association, the Cape Cod Business Round Table, the Association for the Preservation of Cape Cod, the Housing Assistance Corporation of Cape Cod, and the Arts Foundation of Cape Cod.

She was known for photography and sculptural installations. She was active from 1998 until her death in 2015.  Personal life  Born Hema Hirani in Baroda, she met her future husband and fellow artist Chintan Upadhyay in 1992. The couple married in 1998, and settled in Mumbai. They worked together in many exhibitions, before filing for a divorce in 2010. They were officially divorced in 2014. Chintan then moved to Delhi; she lived in their flat on the Juhu-Tara road.  Early works  Hema had her first solo exhibition, titled Sweet Sweat Memories, at Gallery Chemould, now Chemould Prescott road (Mumbai), in 2001. The exhibition consisted of mixed media on paper works. In these works she has incorporated her own photographs to communicate her ideas of migration having moved to Bombay in 1998. Hema's paintings were usually characterised by the inclusion of small-collaged photographic self-portraits. Hema Upadhyay the nymph and adult.jpg  The Nymph and the Adult, Installation, 2001, Artspace, Sydney, Australia Hema Upadhyay made in china.jpg  Made in China, Collaborative installation, 2003, Gallery Chemould, Mumbai, India In 2001 Hema had her first international solo at Artspace, Sydney, and Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane, Australia, where she exhibited an installation titled The Nymph and the Adult (also exhibited at the 10th International Triennial ‚Äì India held in New Delhi) she hand sculpted 2000 lifelike cockroaches, infesting the gallery with them. The work was intended to make viewers think about the consequences of military actions. In collaboration with Chintan Upadhyay, she did a work titled Made in China, which spoke about mass consumerism, globalisation and a loss of identity through this. Her next collaboration was in 2006 when she collaborated with her mother, Bina Hirani, the work was titled Mum-my and was shown at the Chicago Cultural Centre.  Museum exhibitions  From 2004 onwards, Hema Upadhyay came up with installations that were part of various group shows at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art Beijing, China; National Portrait Gallery Canberra, Australia; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; Museum on the Seam, Jerusalem, Israel; MACRO museum, Rome, Italy; IVAM, Valencia, Spain; Mart Museum, Italy; Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, Japan; Hanger Bicocca, Milan, Italy; Chicago Cultural Centre, Chicago, USA; Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux Arts, Paris, France; Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Fukuoka, Japan; Japan Foundation, Tokyo and the Henie Onstad Kunssenter, Oslo, Norway. A few months after Hema died, in 2016, her work was exhibited under the theme \\"Megacities Asia\\" at the Museum of fine arts, Boston. 8feet x 12feet.JPG8' x 12', 2009, installation, Indian Highway Hema Upadhyay WHERE THE BEES SUCK THERE SUCK I.jpgWhere the bees suck, there suck I, 2009, MACRO Museum, Rome, Italy Think left think right.JPGThink left, think right, think low, think tight, 2010, Aichi Triennial, Nagoya, Japan & Centre Pompidou, Paris, France, 2011 She was the only Indian artist to be part of the inaugural exhibition for the Reopening of the MACRO museum, Rome. The exhibition was curated by Luca Massimi Barbero, Hema exhibited her installation titled Where the bees suck, there suck I.  Residencies and workshops  In 2010, Hema was invited to a residency at Atelier Calder, Sache, France. While there, she completed the work Only Memory has Preservatives, this work was inspired by the natural surroundings in Sache, but also reflected ideas that have been part of her practice. Hema tried to replicate the forest in her studio, though not in the literal sense. Using copyright free images of certain trees found in the area, she created a landscape work without using materials from nature. In 2003 she was part of the Vasl residency in Karachi where she made a work titled Loco foco motto (which she later in 2007 exhibited in a group show at the Hanger Bicocca, Milan, Italy) that spoke about the India-Pakistan divide keeping in mind her own family history related to the partition of India. The works were also a break from her trademark symbolism, they were more craft oriented as she used matchsticks and glue to make chandeliers. Constructed of thousands of un-ignited matchsticks assembled into elaborate chandeliers, these pieces embody an important element of Hindu ritual, symbolising creation and destruction. Her later works featured patterned surfaces, which quote from Indian spiritual iconography and traditional textile design, titled Killing Site. Dream a wish-wish a dream (2006) was the first large-scale installation that Hema did. At first glance her installation seems to be only a landscape of Bombay; however, it is actually a statement on the changing landscape by migrants who make Bombay.

Bhambhani had represented Hema in court cases against her ex-husband Chintan. After filing for a divorce in 2010, Chintan and Hema had lived in different rooms of their Mumbai flat until their divorce in 2014. In 2013, Hema had filed a harassment case against Chintan, accusing him of painting obscene sketches on the walls of their Mumbai flat. Represented by Bhambhani, she lost the case after the court ruled that Chintan's bedroom was his personal space. After their divorce, Chintan moved to Delhi. Bhambani represented Hema in another case seeking alimony: Hema demanded an alimony of 200,000 per month; but the court reduced that amount to 40,000 per month. On the day of their murders, Chintan had paid 200,000 to Bhambhani as part of an alimony payout. Hema had contracted out her art fabrication work to Vidyadhar Rajbhar (alias Gotu), the owner of Vanshraj Arts. She also stored her artwork at his warehouse. Vidyadhar's family had a close relationship with the family of her ex-husband Chintan. In fact, Vidyadhar's father Vanshraj had named him after Chintan's father. When Vidyadhar's father fell ill and faced financial troubles, Chintan paid for his medical expenses of over 500,000. Chintan had also sponsored Vidyadhar's training in fabrication at Jaipur. According to Vidyadhar's associates, Hema owed Vidyadhar some money, and he had visited Hema's residence many times to seek the payment. However, according to the police investigators, it was Vidyadhar who was heavily in debt, and had taken loans from Hema, Chintan and others. He owed Hema 200,000. On the day of the murders, he called Hema to his Kandivali warehouse, claiming that he had some video evidence that could strengthen her case against Chintan. Hema took along Bhambhani to examine the evidence. On 11 December, the day of the murders, Hema called her domestic help Lalit Mandal around 6.30pm, informing him that she would have dinner outside. Bhambhani left his Matunga home around 6pm, telling his family that he was going to meet a client in Andheri. The two met at Hema's studio in Andheri. Around 8 pm, they left for Kandivali to meet Vidyadhar. At the warehouse, Vidyadhar was accompanied by his associates Azad Rajbhar, Pradeep Rajbhar and Shiv Kumar Rajbhar (alias Sadhu). They had planned to scare Hema using a chemical-soaked napkin. The chemical is believed to be chloroform (used to clean the moulds of sculptures) or a pesticide (which Vidyadhar procured from his brother). Vidyadhar held Hema from behind, as Azad held the napkin to her face. When Bhambhani intervened, Shiv and Pradeep overpowered him. Initially, they only restrained Bhambhani with ropes and duct tapes. But when they realized that the chemical had killed Hema, they killed Bhambhani for being a witness. The Rajbhars packed the dead bodies in cardboard boxes that they used to transport artwork. They then transported the bodies to the drain (nullah) in a temp truck driven by Vijay Kumar Rajbhar. Vidyadhar and Shiv then decided to escape to their native village in Uttar Pradesh. They caught a train to Varanasi from Dadar around 9:30 pm. After reaching Itarsi, Vidyadhar told Shiv that he wanted to surrender, and got off the train. A Museum of Arts, Boston official, mourned the death of Hema. Her work was scheduled to be exhibited at the museum a few months after she died.  Police investigation  When Hema did not return home at night, her domestic help Mandal tried to contact her, only to find her mobile phone switched off. He then contacted her relatives and friends. The next morning, he registered a missing persons complaint. Bhambani's family also found his phone switched off, and registered a complaint. On Saturday, around 7:30 pm, a sweeper noticed a hand in the boxes floating in the drain, opposite a crematorium in the Dahanukar Wadi area of Kandivali. He alerted the police, who retrieved the boxes. The bodies had been wrapped in transparent polyurethane sheets before being stuffed in the cardboard boxes. They were naked except for undergarments. The bodies had not decomposed, and the police were able to identify the victims. Based on the CCTV footage and call records, the police determined that the two had met at her studio in Andheri, and left in Bhambhani's car. The last call made from Bhambani's mobile phone, around 8:30pm, was traced to Kandivali. The police located the manufacturing details and the batch number from the cardboard boxes. This, in addition to the call detail records of the victims, led the police to Vidyadhar's fabrication unit in Laljipada area of Kandivali. After analyzing CCTV footage from some houses in the area, the police apprehended Vijay, the truck driver. Vijay informed the police about the other suspects, but insisted that he did not know that there were dead bodies inside the boxes. The police then arrested Azad and Pradeep. A Special Task Force (STF) of the Uttar Pradesh police intercepted Shiv Kumar on his way from the Varanasi station to his native village Gosaipur. The STF recovered ATM cards, SIM cards and other documents belonging to Hema and Bhambhani from him. He confessed to the murders. Vidyadhar is currently at large. The police have not completely ruled out Chintan as a suspect, due to his close acquaintance with Vidyadhar. The call detail record (CDR) of Chintan's phone shows that the two men exchanged several calls a fortnight before the murders. Hema's family as well as police suspect that Chintan paid Vidyadhar to commit her murder. In February 2016, a group of 61 artists demanded his release arguing that the police had been unable to find any evidence against him.

According to President Obama \\"the legislation crystallizes the commitment of the United States to help bring an end to the brutality and destruction that have been a hallmark of the LRA across several countries for two decades, and to pursue a future of greater security and hope for the people of central Africa\\". In October 2011 Obama announced that he would send 100 American military advisors to Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to help the regional forces remove Joseph Kony \\"from the battlefield\\". However, they were not authorized to fight unless they were fired upon. Response Human rights advocates have reported that both the Ugandan army and the former Sudan People's Liberation Army, which forms the core of the new South Sudanese army, have exploited children as soldiers. Some of them criticized the U.S. decision to provide military assistance for armies accused of using child soldiers: \\"Countries that keep using child soldiers aren't going to get serious about ending the practice until they see the US is serious about withholding the money,\\" said Jo Becker, child rights advocate at Human Rights Watch. In addition, government forces of Uganda and its neighbour countries have themselves been accused of human rights violations such as attacks against civilians, use of child soldiers and looting of civilian homes and businesses. On the other hand, Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth welcomed U.S. efforts to bring \\"war criminals in Africa\\" to justice, adding: \\"In fact, we [HRW] often find ourselves urging governments to use their coercive power more assertively to protect civilians. We want to see Joseph Kony and others responsible for atrocities ‚Äì whether they are abusive leaders in countries like Sudan, or terrorists who kill civilians, brought to justice.\\"Lawfare - Human Rights Watch Responds There has also been a more realist analysis of President Obama's decision to send military advisers to the region, with some suggesting that the assistance was a reward for Ugandan assistance in Somalia.

The park is 27 acres, and borders the cities of Wyandotte and Ecorse. The point itself is formed by the northern and southern branches of the Ecorse River, just before it reaches the Detroit River. The land for the park was purchased in the late 1980s. The park's dimensions were courtesy of Wade Trim and Associates. The park includes a 1.9 mile jogging track along the Ecorse River, two baseball/softball diamonds, two soccer fields, a picnic pavilion, a children's park with a playscape, an inline hockey arena, and a permanent restroom/storage building. History Council Point Park is the site of a significant event in the history of the state of Michigan. In 1763, Chief Pontiac, the chief of the Ottawa tribe in Michigan, called for a council along the Ecorse River of all of the tribes in what is now Michigan. The tribes that were present at this council were the Wyandot, Detroit Ottawa, and the Potawatomi. Pontiac called these tribes to action, stating that not only did he and other Natives want the British gone, but that it was a special task sent from the King of France to attack and remove the British from the former French territories. Pontiac's plan was to attack Fort Detroit in 3 days. After a few abortive attempts to take the fort by trickery, Pontiac and his people laid siege to the fort, and kept it besieged for six months. A series of small farm fields and woods was purchased from the Levy Company by the City of Lincoln Park in the late 1980s to become Council Point Park. The city partnered with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in order to clean up a small toxic waste spill. Hazardous chemicals, including heavy metals used in steel making, had spilled into the park and needed to be cleaned up before the park was opened. The Department of Natural Resources cleaned up the land to make it a safe park. The 1915 Musta family farmhouse, located at 3051 River Drive (at Mayflower) along the western edge of the park, still remains. An Army Corps of Engineers water access was modified and rebuilt in WWII and is still buried beneath the property and is also documented in the Washington CoE register. Activities Council Point Park is host to a variety of activities. The park has two baseball diamonds in which little league practices and games are held. The park has two youth soccer fields used during the summer. There is a 1.9 mile walking/jogging track that outlines the perimeter of the park. One of the park's new attractions is an inline hockey rink in which inline summer roller hockey leagues are played. Local inline hockey players can also skate year round. The park also includes a picnic pavilion in which many families and organizations host picnics and parties. The Lincoln Park Relay for Life is held at Council Point, every year on Mother's Day weekend. Entertainment Council Point Park is used for a Pow Wow by the American Indian Movement of Michigan, to commemorate Pontiac's great meeting back in the 1760s. The Pow Wow offers the opportunity for children and adults both to learn about the happenings of the Council of Pontiac, and the rich cultural heritage of the original inhabitants of this area, along with dancing, fun games and other activities. Council Point Park also has several different venues for visitors of the park to sit down and watch sporting events including baseball, softball, soccer, and inline hockey. Geography Council Point Park is a 27-acre park on the eastern edge of the City of Lincoln Park. The park is bordered by the Northern and Southern branches of the Ecorse Creek to the east, and River Drive to the west. The Creek forms the borders between the City of Lincoln Park, Wyandotte on the southern end, and Ecorse on the north end.

Early life Campeau was born in 1980 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Having played guitar since the age of 5, Campeau began as a classical player, being taught in Paris, France. Shortly afterwards, his family moved back to his birthplace where he was exposed by new guitar teachers to different, more rock-based styles, which would serve as major influences later on. Towards the end of high-school, he and a few of his friends formed a short lived, but local successful power pop band named The Smokey Murder Sticks. This band relied heavily on the sounds of Weezer, the Police, and Black Sabbath, and managed to release a few demos before disbanding a few years later. The drummer (Jasen Colson), however, would come as an integral part to Campeau's development as a musician, introducing him to bands such as Yes and Genesis. Campeau and Colson soon formed a duo, and began recording complex arrangements at home studios, mostly for the sake of experimentation and creativity. Career After completing a BA in philosophy in Guelph, Ontario, Campeau moved to Sydney, Australia. Campeau slowly built up his recording studio and began composing and recording music, involving mostly intricate guitar work and vocals, layered with programmed beats and synths. He recorded a few demos before releasing Brian Campeau and the Solitary Game in 2004. His follow-up album Two Faces, which was initially released through Vitamin Records in 2007 was recorded using found sounds (similarly to Matmos), and second disc, made up of exactly the same songs as the first, was recorded with different versions of the songs. This album was well received in Australia, and was also well reviewed by many publications and radio stations, including Triple J,Triple J ‚Äì Review of Brian Campeau Sydney's FBI Radio, and the Sydney Morning Herald.Sydney Morning Herald ‚Äì Review of Two Faces After about two years of touring and recording, Campeau released Mostly Winter Sometimes Spring through Inertia Music in 2009. The primary focus for this album was to use only one instrument per song, using different aspects of each instrument to create layers of melody and percussion. Musicians on this album included Elana Stone, Zoe Hauptmann, Kate Adams and Ruth Wells. Some of the instruments used were upright bass, melodica, harmonium, various guitars, and saxophone. This album was also well received by numerous publications around Australia,Sydney Morning Herald ‚Äì Review of Mostly Winter Sometimes Spring and led to an extensive tour of the west of Australia.Music Feeds Article on Brian Campeau's Mostly Winter Sometimes Spring tour As well as running The Plex Recording Studio,http://briancampeau.bandcamp.com/album/the-plex-recording- studio Campeau is involved in several projects in and around Sydney. * The Rescue Ships: a duo with Elana Stone (currently recording a full-length album) * The Green Mohair Suits: a bluegrass band with Jason Mannell, Richard Cuthbert, Mikey Floyd, and Ben Romalis * Jimmy Swouse and the Angry Darts: a rock band with James Maybury, Chris Arnott, Dave Sattout and Josh Ahearn (currently recording a full-length album) * The Elana Stone Band : with Elana Stone, Aaron Flower, Zoe Hauptmann, and Evan Mannell * Manger: a semi rock- folk band with Zoe Vaughan, Oli Pieterse, and Mikaela Adams He has also worked with Melanie Horsnell, Angus and Julia Stone, Passenger (Mike Rosenburg), Cuthbert and the Nightwalkers, and Emma Davis.

The album was released on March 8, 2011 through E1 Music. Digital Veil marks the return of founding guitarist A.J. Minette, who left in 2007, and the introduction of the new lead vocalist Travis Richter, who replaced former vocalist Nathan Ells. The first single off the album, titled \\"Faust,\\" was released digitally on November 16, 2010. Background Prior to working on Digital Veil, The Human Abstract went through a few line-up changes. In November 2009, the band announced that they had parted ways with vocalist Nathan Ells who sang on 2006's Nocturne and 2008's Midheaven. Due to conflicting statements from the band and Ells, there was some debate on whether the singer quit or was fired. After his departure, the group held open auditions for a new singer. In April 2010, The Human Abstract announced that Travis Richter of The Color of Violence, and formerly of From First to Last, would replace Ells on vocals. Guitarist Andrew Tapley personally called Richter and asked him to try out by first recording his vocals for \\"Vela Together We Await the Storm\\" and then a demo song from Digital Veil. Richter knew the band through previously touring in From First to Last with The Human Abstract on Warped Tour and the Take Action Tour. The band also reunited with their founding guitarist and primary songwriter A.J. Minette. Minette left the band after the touring cycle for Nocturne and continued his education in classical music, and was also trying to avoid being \\"pigeonholed as a metal guitarist.\\" According to bassist Henry Selva, Minette also brought back a level of discipline to the band that was absent during the Midheaven sessions. Writing and recording The Human Abstract took time away from their touring schedule in June 2009 to begin writing their third studio album. While writing was underway, drummer Brett Powell contacted A.J. Minette and asked him if he wanted to return as a producer for the material they had been working on. After accepting the request and assuming the role of producer, he began having an increasing input on writing until \\"eventually it just became an album.\\" The schooling that Minette received during his time spent outside of The Human Abstract had a strong impact on his writing for Digital Veil. Minette said that, \\"It has been exciting to write metal music again. We all want to make something that we can believe in, so we all have been digging deeper to become better musicians and composers. I wanted to take my classical studies and apply them to metal, but I did not want it to turn out sounding like power metal.\\" Travis Richter officially began writing for Digital Veil after formally joining the band and flying to Los Angeles, California on February 1, 2010. While he still retains his more aggressive vocal stylings from his previous projects, Richter also showcases his singing on the album. In his youth he grew up singing in a choir for a southern Baptist church. The Human Abstract's music was far more technical and complex than anything from Richter's background, which resulted in some initial acclimation and adjustments for this new setting. The lyrics written for Digital Veil discuss \\"ideas about identity, personal transformation and purpose.\\" The band entered The Machine Shop studio with producer William Putney on July 1, 2010. During production, Putney suffered a serious head injury requiring 57 staples to close the wound. Shortly after leaving the studio to buy cigarettes, he called Dean Herrera and said, \\"My head's bleeding, can you bring some paper towels.\\" Putney was found at the bottom of some stairs just outside the studio in a puddle of blood, and was quickly rushed to the hospital. During his absence, Herrera filled in as a temporary producer. However, William Putney returned to the studio just two days after the incident. Commenting on the producer's quick recovery, A.J. Minette stated, \\"Most normal men would have been sidelined for a while, but Will has a work ethic and dedication to his job that separates him from the rest.\\" Release and promotion The \\"Faust\\" digital single cover art. Promotion and marketing for Digital Veil was originally being handled by Hopeless Records, The Human Abstract's label since their debut album Nocturne in 2006. Through Hopeless Records, the band released the promotional single \\"Faust\\" from Digital Veil on November 16, 2010, and an early 2011 release date was anticipated for the record. However, on January 10, The Human Abstract announced that they had signed to E1 Music and the album would be released on March 8, 2011. On signing to a major label, Henry Selva commented that they expected E1 to \\"help push the band a step forward into a productive and exciting future.\\" Prior to the release of Digital Veil, The Human Abstract previewed an additional two songs online after the release of \\"Faust\\" and the announcement of signing to E1. The song \\"Patterns\\" was available on January 18, and \\"Complex Terms\\" was available on February 15. A Scott Hansen directed promotional music video for the title track \\"Digital Veil\\" was also released in February 2011. Hansen also directed the video for \\"Patterns,\\" which was released on April 13. Touring When guitarist A.J. Minette rejoined the band in 2009, it was uncertain if he would be able to tour with The Human Abstract in support of Digital Veil due to his prior commitment of working toward his master's degree at the University of Southern California School of Music. However, he later decided to take a year off from school to free up his schedule specifically for touring in support of the record. A few weeks before the band left on tour, The Human Abstract decided to part ways with guitarist Andrew Tapley. The first tour The Human Abstract embarked on in promotion of Digital Veil was the Atticus Metal Tour III sponsored by Atticus Clothing. The tour lasted February‚ÄìMarch 2011 with Darkest Hour, Born of Osiris and As Blood Runs Black. The Human Abstract's first scheduled headlining tour in support of Digital Veil was the \\"Pull Me from the Gallows Tour\\" which was supposed to run May‚ÄìJune 2011 across the United States. The opening acts for this leg were: Scale the Summit, This or the Apocalypse, Letlive, No Bragging Rights and Across the Sun. However, midway into the tour The Human Abstract pulled out of the tour due to a sudden death in the family. Shortly before embarking on the \\"Frak the Gods\\" tour in September 2011 with Periphery, Textures and The Contortionist, vocalist Travis Richter abruptly quit the band. The Human Abstract quickly replaced him with Ryan Devlin of the progressive metal band Corelia as a temporary touring member. Reception=Charts and sales In its debut week, Digital Veil sold approximately 3,200 copies in the United States allowing it to enter the Billboard 200 chart at number 177. The album also ranked at number 5 on the US Top Heatseekers chart. These figures are slightly lower than those for The Human Abstract's previous album, Midheaven, which sold around 4,100 copies and ranked at number 163 on the Billboard 200.

Statement If a finite group G has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions with representatives t and z, then the Thompson order formula states : G = C_g(z) a(t) + C_g(t) a(z) Here a(x) is the number of pairs (u,v) with u conjugate to t, v conjugate to z, and x in the subgroup generated by uv. gives the following more complicated version of the Thompson order formula for the case when G has more than two conjugacy classes of involution. :G = C_G(t)C_G(z) \\\\sum_x\\\\frac{a(x)}{C_G(x)} where t and z are non-conjugate involutions, the sum is over a set of representatives x for the conjugacy classes of involutions, and a(x) is the number of ordered pairs of involutions u,v such that u is conjugate to t, v is conjugate to z, and x is the involution in the subgroup generated by tz. Proof The Thompson order formula can be rewritten as :\\\\frac{G}{C_G(z)}\\\\frac{G}{C_G(t)} = \\\\sum_x a(x)\\\\frac{G}{C_G(x)} where as before the sum is over a set of representatives x for the classes of involutions.

The right hand side counts these pairs in classes, depending the class of the involution in the cyclic group generated by uv. The key point is that uv has even order (as if it had odd order then u and v would be conjugate) and so the group it generates contains a unique involution x.

They were used from 1905 to 1964. The 1964 state highway renumbering changed the highway numbering in the state to consolidate and create a more organized and systematic method of numbering the highways within the state. History The first state road, running across the Cascade Range roughly where State Route 20 now crosses it, was designated by the legislature in 1893 (However, this road wasn't actually opened until 1972). Two other roads‚Äîa Cascade crossing at present State Route 410 and a branch of the first road to Wenatchee‚Äîwere added in 1897. The Washington Highway Department was established in 1905, and a set of twelve State Roads, numbered from 1 to 12, were assigned. A thirteenth was added in 1907, and State Roads 14 to 18 in 1909.State Roads As Established by Legislature, 1893 to 1935 - However, it was not until 1913 that a connected system was laid out‚Äîearlier state roads had been disconnected segments of road needing improvements. The seven primary roads were only assigned names, while the older state roads kept their numbers as secondary roads. In 1923, most state roads were assigned new numbers, though the primary and secondary split remained, and several roads remained named only. The United States Numbered Highways were assigned in late 1926, overlapping some of the State Roads. The first major reworking of the system was passed in 1937, including a complete renumbering. A number of Primary State Highways were designated, while Secondary State Highways were suffixed spurs off those. For instance, Primary State Highway 1 was the Pacific Highway (present Interstate 5), and Secondary State Highway 1B was a spur from Bellingham to the Canadian border (now State Route 539). U.S. Routes kept dual designations with State Highways. By 1952, the present highway shield, in the shape of George Washington's head, had been adopted. The primary/secondary state highway systems were replaced by the current numbering system in the 1960s. The signs for the new highway numbers first were posted in 1964, while the PSH/SSH signs were removed in 1970. Secondary State Highways Secondary State Highways (SSH) were branches of Primary State Highways.Highways of Washington State- SSH *Branches of PSH 1 *Branches of PSH 2 *Branches of PSH 3 *Branches of PSH 4 *Branches of PSH 5 *Branches of PSH 6 *Branches of PSH 7 *Branches of PSH 8 *Branches of PSH 9 *Branches of PSH 10 *Branches of PSH 11 *Branches of PSH 12 *Branches of PSH 13 *Branches of PSH 14 *Branches of PSH 15 *Branches of PSH 16 *Branches of PSH 17 *Branches of PSH 21 *Branches of PSH 22 Primary State Highway 1 PSH 1 followed the route of U.S. Route 99 (now Interstate 5) from Vancouver to Blaine.

Amanda Hall Rogers portrayed the character for two episodes on June 9 and June 10, 2003, before being written off. The character was reintroduced, portrayed by actress Lindsay Hartley on December 9, 2010, until the series finale on September 23, 2011. In December 2012, it was announced that Hartley would reprise the role for the impending online reboot on April 29, 2013. Casting Lindsay Hartley is a veteran of daytime having been a cast member of the NBC and DirecTV soap opera Passions for its entire run from 1999 to 2008. Following a short break from the genre, Hartley was cast on NBC's long-running soap Days of Our Lives as former undercover agent Arianna Hernandez from 2009 to 2010 before being let go. However, a month later she began appearing on All My Children as Cara Castillo, a doctor who shared a past with Dr. Jake Martin, (Ricky Paull Goldin). Following her exit from Days, Hartley's manager contacted AMC, as well as other soaps based in the Los Angeles area, when the show's executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers and casting director Judy Wilson asked to meet with the actress to cast her in a new role. In a November 3, 2010 interview with TV Guide reporter Michael Logan, Hartley discussed the development of her character. > \\"I love this character. She's not a girl. I feel like she's the first truly > mature woman I've had a chance to play. You find out [Cara and Jake] fell in > love while working in Africa with Doctors Without Borders and they got > married but something went down and Cara took off with another man. At least > that's what Jake believes happened, and that's what the audience will > believe. Then there's the truth, which will slowly unravel.\\" ‚ÄîHartley, TV > Guide Storylines=2003 Dr. Carolyn Finn first came to town in 2003 with her fianc√© Dr. Jake Martin to meet his family and announce their engagement. The two of them met each other while working with Doctors Without Borders. They eventually married and left for Africa to serve with Doctors Without Borders. When Jake came back to Pine Valley in 2008, he said that Carolyn had left him for a truck driver, and they're no longer together. 2010‚Äì11 In November 2010, Jake received an e-mail for a job offer with Doctors Without Borders. When his brother, Tad, comes up, he reveals that he got the offer from \\"Cara\\" ‚àí as in Carolyn. Jake tells Tad that this is the first time he's heard from Cara since she left him, and it's clear he's still hurt by what he saw as a betrayal. A few days later, Griffin Castillo shows up in town. Jake takes one look at him, and punches him. Later, he reveals to Tad that Griffin was the man he saw Cara drive off with. Griffin claims that he hasn't heard from Cara since then, but later, it's clear the two are still close. Cara soon shows up in Pine Valley, and makes her way to Krystal's to meet Griffin. While there, she sees Amanda Martin walk in and while she's chatting with owner Krystal Carey, Cara realizes that Amanda is Jake's wife and the mother of his son. It became obvious that Cara's return meant that Amanda needed to fight for her marriage. Cara later goes to the hospital to try to convince Jake again to return to Doctors Without Borders, and that's where Tad comes in and reveals that Griffin is not Cara's lover but that he's her brother. Cara's last name is actually Castillo, not Finn. Cara tells Jake that she wanted out of the marriage, so she asked Griffin to help stage a situation so that Jake would leave her completely. When she later tells Griffin about this, she tells him she lied to Jake about why she left. Cara finds out that she can't leave the country due to a problem with her immigration papers. Cara decides to get a job at Pine Valley Hospital when she finds out they are short-staffed and after Jake says he doesn't have a problem working with her. Though Cara insists that she no longer has feelings for Jake, she is revealed to have kept their wedding rings. In mid-January, it is revealed that Cara had leukemia as a child, at the age of 8. She revealed this to Jake after she got too emotionally involved with a child patient at the hospital and confronted the parents about how they were treating their daughter. In February, it is revealed that, while working with DWB, Cara chose to help a little boy who was caught in a crossfire between a group of drug dealers over the brother of a drug cartel leader and let him die. This experience has come back to haunt her: the drug dealer's associates are planning to kill her as soon as she leaves the United States. With this, Jake, Tad, Griffin, and Cara come up with a plan to fake her death. However, Amanda, then unaware of Cara's situation and simply wanting her out of her life, calls the Feds on Cara. At the time that they were getting ready to take her for further investigation, Tad comes in and tells them that is his fianc√©e and to let go of her. Griffin and Cara's mother Leticia Castillo came in to be there for Cara and Tad's wedding, but really there was another reason for her being there: to convince Cara that this is not the best for her. Leticia takes it upon herself to discuss the situation her daughter has with the Martin brothers. She goes through with the wedding with the Feds watching over them. They decided that they needed to put as much effort into it as possible. She and Tad married on March 9, 2011 with friends and family by their sides. On August 10, 2011, Cara meets Tad's ex- wife and Kathy's mother Dixie Cooney Martin. Tad explains to Cara that he is still in love with Dixie and she soon begins a relationship with David Hayward. Cara and David's tryst resulted in her pregnancy. When Cara told David she was pregnant he was thrilled and wanted the baby with Cara and to be by her side personally and in his medical practice, practicing medicine together as a team. 2013 Cara is still working at the hospital in Pine Valley. It was revealed that David Hayward was sent to prison for putting JR Chandler into a coma. Cara reveals that while David was in prison, she wrote him a letter that she had a miscarriage and lost the baby. David constantly sent her letters as well, but Cara burned all of them wanting to erase David from her life. It is revealed that Cara had possibly lied about what actually happened to the baby and gotten an abortion and lied about having a miscarriage. JR tells Cara that he could hear what she was saying even though in coma. He knows that her and David's child is alive. It's later revealed that David and Cara's child was a boy and is safely living with her mother in Puerto Rico. JR surprises Cara by having her mother and her son travel from Puerto Rico to live at the Chandler mansion. JR tells Cara that he will hire Leticia as their new cook, while Oliver is her grandson and their true identities will not be revealed. Reception When the subject of Cara not being a documented resident of the United States arose, the plot device coincided with the real-life issue of U.S. immigration laws. Cara, being a legal resident of Mexico, came to the U.S. to reconcile with her husband Jake and win back his love, but Jake's jealous wife Amanda notified officials to get Cara deported. Following questions on Cara's future, she entered a green- card marriage with Jake's brother Tad and married him to remain a resident in the U.S. The subject immediately caused debates among viewers of the show, especially on the show's promptness on allowing Cara to remain in the country with little question from officials. In an article on Fox News Latino, the subject was emphasized with real viewers opinions that were written on online discussion boards. > \\"It‚Äôs not that easy,‚Äù wrote a poster on an AOL board about cross-country > marriage. ‚ÄúMy brother married a woman from Peru and it took two years to get > her to the U.S.‚Äù Another started a long post with, ‚ÄúThe writers probably > don‚Äôt want to get into this but ‚Ä¶\\" and went on to bemoan the lack of paths > to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as > children.\\" ‚ÄîFox News Latino The story also mirrored a similar one that occurred on General Hospital, which saw Siobhan McKenna, a legal resident of Ireland living in the U.S. while undocumented, proposed to by her boyfriend Lucky Spencer so that she could remain in the country and not face deportation. The article also discussed that it was with little effort for Cara to get a job at the town's hospital even though she was not legally enabled to work without a proper visa. While Cara was able to remain in the country and eventually receive her sufficient residency documents, the character's story used real-world situations to educate viewers on a subject that has occurred in millions of families living in the country and its effect on a person's eligibility to become a legal citizen.

(St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc. Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company's ultimate parent, USF&G; Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity. On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc (\\"Old Mutual\\"), a London-based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001. As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. (\\"OMUSLH\\"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was US$635 million. On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas- domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., (\\"Omnia\\"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company's parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia. Effective January 1, 2007, the company's board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company's charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007. On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.supra Indexed Annuity and Certain Other Insurance Contracts (generally) A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC's ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal. On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group. Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate. Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO. At that time, \\"OM Financial Life Insurance Company\\" changed its name back to \\"Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company\\". In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-11-04/business/bs-bz-fidelity- life-20131104_1_falcone-harbinger-group-harbor-east The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013 In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company. The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014. In August 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering. In November 2015, Fidelity announced an agreement to sell the company to the Chinese insurance firm Anbang Insurance for a fee of around $1.57 billion. But the deal was terminated and the company was sold to CF Corp in 2017. CF Corp rebranded as FGL Holdingshttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cf- corporation-completes-acquisition-of-fidelity--guaranty-life-300564663.html. In 2019, FGL Holdings rebranded Fidelity & Guaranty Life as F&G;, seeking to distinguish the company from other companies with Fidelity in their names.https://www.siegelvision.com/fandg Later in 2019, FGL Holdings agreed to be acquired by the previously-unrelated Fidelity National Financial, a deal that closed in 2020. Business Policies are offered in every state and the District of Columbia, in New York, products are offered through a wholly owned subsidiary, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York.

The house purportedly creates its perfumes in-house by two perfumers: a father and his son. The current generation consists of Olivier Creed (who is credited for Green Irish Tweed, Millesime Imperial, Silver Mountain Water and Aventus among others) and his son Erwin Creed. James Henry Creed supposedly founded the House of Creed in London in 1760 as a tailoring establishment, however the earliest evidence of Creed's existence hark from the late 1960s or early 1970s. It rose to fame in the mid 19th century under Henry Creed as tailors and habit makers for the fashionable dandy Count d'Orsay, Queen Victoria, and Empress Eug√©nie, who issued the firm of Creed & Cumberland a Royal Warrant for tailoring articles.Charles Creed, Maid to Measure (London, 1961) Olivier Creed's first eponymously named fragrance was a traditional eau de cologne with matching aftershave. Its release date is unknown, although bottles are still in circulation. Creed also has other high-profile creations in its catalog such as Angelique Encens, which was said to have been originally created in 1933 for the Bishop of Paris.  Popular culture  Creed has stated that it has created perfumes exclusively for celebrities and well-known political figures. Creed claims that Tabarome Millesime (2000) \\"was commissioned by a legendary British statesman who loved fine brandy and highest quality cigars\\" but this is without historical confirmation.. Also, Creed's Vetiver is marketed to have been created for \\"one of America's leading families, a political dynasty now known worldwide for its energy, vigor, and impeccable style\\"  Mainstream success  Creed's mainstream breakthrough success came in the mid-1980s with the fresh foug√®re fragrance Green Irish Tweed (1985), an eau de parfum composed by Olivier Creed. The first trademark for Creed perfume was registered in 1979 in France.INPI ‚Äì Service de recherche marques Creed's marketing masterpiece, the fragrance Aventus (2010) has seen good commercial success.

However, by the time the colonial era drew to a close in the last half of the twentieth century, missionaries became viewed as \\"ideological shock troops for colonial invasion whose zealotry blinded them\\", colonialism's \\"agent, scribe and moral alibi.\\" In some areas, almost all of the colony's population were removed from their traditional belief systems and were turned into the Christian faith, which the colonizers used as a reason to destroy other faiths, enslave the natives, and exploit the lands and seas.Religion in the Andes: vision and imagination in early colonial Peru, S MacCormack - 1991Savage systems: Colonialism and comparative religion in Southern Africa, D Chidester - 1996Hindu-Catholic encounters in Goa: Religion, colonialism, and modernity, A Henn - 2014The History of Filipino Women's Writings by Riitta Vartti, An article from Firefly - Filipino Short Stories, Helsinki 2001\\"Philippine Gay Culture: Binabae to Bakla, Silahis to MSM (Queer Asia)\\", J.

For example, Toyin Falola asserts that there were some missionaries who believed that \\"the agenda of colonialism in Africa was similar to that of Christianity\\". Falola cites Jan H. Boer of the Sudan United Mission as saying, \\"Colonialism is a form of imperialism based on a divine mandate and designed to bring liberation ‚Äì spiritual, cultural, economic and political ‚Äì by sharing the blessings of the Christ-inspired civilization of the West with a people suffering under satanic oppression, ignorance and disease, effected by a combination of political, economic and religious forces that cooperate under a regime seeking the benefit of both ruler and ruled.\\" Edward Andrews writes: > Historians have traditionally looked at Christian missionaries in one of two > ways.

A mission centre established at Yuriria, Mexico in 1550 During the Age of Discovery, the Catholic Church inaugurated a major effort to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the Native Americans and other indigenous people. The missionary effort was a major part of, and a partial justification for the colonial efforts of European powers such as Spain, France and Portugal. Christian Missions to the indigenous peoples ran hand-in-hand with the colonial efforts of Catholic nations. In the Americas and other colonies in Asia and Africa, most missions were run by religious orders such as the Augustinians, Franciscans, Jesuits and Dominicans. In both Portugal and Spain, religion was an integral part of the state and evangelization was seen as having both secular and spiritual benefits. Wherever these powers attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow. By the Treaty of Tordesillas, the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade and colonization. The Roman Catholic world order was challenged by the Netherlands and England. Theoretically, it was repudiated by Grotius's Mare Liberum. Portugal's and Spain's colonial policies were also challenged by the Roman Catholic Church itself. The Vatican founded the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide in 1622 and attempted to separate the churches from the influence of the Iberian kingdoms. Americas Jan van Butselaar writes that \\"for Prince Henry the Navigator and his contemporaries, the colonial enterprise was based on the necessity to develop European commerce and the obligation to propagate the Christian faith.\\" Christian leaders and Christian doctrines have been accused of justifying and perpetrating violence against Native Americans found in the New World.Carroll, Vincent, Christianity on trial: arguments against anti-religious bigotry, p 87.

The Spanish were the first of the future European countries to colonize North and South America. They came into the region predominantly through Cuba and Puerto Rico and into Florida. The Spaniards were committed, by Vatican decree, to convert their New World indigenous subjects to Catholicism. However, often initial efforts (both docile and coerced) were questionably successful, as the indigenous people added Catholicism into their longstanding traditional ceremonies and beliefs. The many native expressions, forms, practices, and items of art could be considered idolatry and prohibited or destroyed by Spanish missionaries, military, and civilians. This included religious items, sculptures, and jewelry made of gold or silver, which were melted down before shipment to Spain. Though the Spanish did not impose their language to the extent they did their religion, some indigenous languages of the Americas evolved into replacement with Spanish, and lost to present day tribal members. When more efficient they did evangelize in native languages. The introduction of writing systems to the Quechua, Nahuatl and Guarani peoples may have contributed to their expansion. In the early years most mission work was undertaken by the religious orders. Over time it was intended that a normal church structure would be established in the mission areas. The process began with the formation of special jurisdictions, known as apostolic prefectures and apostolic vicariates. These developing churches eventually graduated to regular diocesan status with the appointment of a local bishop. After decolonization, this process increased in pace as church structures altered to reflect new political-administrative realities. Hastings, Adrian, A World History of Christianity, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, pp 330‚Äì349 Ralph Bauer describes the Franciscan missionaries as having been \\"unequivocally committed to Spanish imperialism, condoning the violence and coercion of the Conquest as the only viable method of bringing American natives under the saving rule of Christianity.\\" Jordan writes \\"The catastrophe of Spanish America's rape at the hands of the Conquistadors remains one of the most potent and pungent examples in the entire history of human conquest of the wanton destruction of one culture by another in the name of religion\\"\\"In the Name of God : Violence and Destruction in the World's Religions\\", M. Jordan, 2006, p. 230 Antonio de Montesinos, a Dominican friar on the island of Hispaniola, was the first member of the clergy to publicly denounce all forms of enslavement and oppression of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.Hanke, Lewis. (1946) Free Speech in Sixteenth-Century Spanish America. The Hispanic American Historical Review, 26,2:135‚Äì149. Page 142. Theologians such as Francisco de Vitoria and Bartolom√© de las Casas drew up theological and philosophical bases for the defense of the human rights of the colonized native populations, thus creating the basis of international law, regulating the relationships between nations. The Native Americans only gave way to the force of the European after they were overcome with the diseases the Europeans had spread. The Evangelization of the natives in the Americas began with private colonization. The Crown tried to establish rules to protect the natives against any unjust war of conquest. The Spanish could start a war against those who rejected the kings authority and who were aware and also rejected Christianity. There was a doctrine developed that allowed the conquest of natives if they were uncivilized. Friars and Jesuits learned native languages instead of teaching the natives Spanish because they were trying to protect them from the colonists‚Äô negative influences. In addition, the missionaries felt it was important to show the positive aspects of the new religion to the natives after the epidemics and harsh conquest that had just occurred.  French missions The Jesuit order (the Society of Jesus) established missions among the Iroquois in North America by the 1650s‚Äì1660s. Their success in the study of indigenous languages Was appreciated by the Iroquois, who helped them expand into the Great Lakes region by 1675. Their order was banished from France in 1736, but they did not entirely disappear from North America, and an American diocese was established in 1804.Daniel Hechenberger, \\"The Jesuits: History and Impact: From Their Origins Prior to the Baroque Crisis to Their Role in the Illinois Country.\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society 100#2 (2007): 85‚Äì109 Online. In the 1830s Marist missionaries from the Catholic Society of Mary promoted missions to various Pacific islands Oceana. The head of the order Friar Jean-Claude Colin and Bishop Jean-Baptiste-Fran√ßois Pompallier worked in close conjunction with the colonized imperialism and colony-building program of the French government.William Jennings, \\"The First Marist Missionaries and French Colonial Policy in the Pacific (1836‚Äì42).\\" \\"French History & Civilization (2014), Vol. 5, pp 112‚Äì122. Trouble arose in Hawaii, where the local government strongly favored Protestant missionaries from the United States over the Picpusien Fathers, who had established a mission in Honolulu in 1827. Puritanical American missionaries wanted the Catholics expelled until the French Navy arrived in 1839 and issued an ultimatum to tolerate the Catholics.Mary Ellen Birkett, \\"Forging French Colonial Policy in the Pacific.\\" French Colonial History 8.1 (2007): 155‚Äì169.  Jesuit missions Various missions and initiatives of the Jesuits predated, accompanied and followed western colonization across the world. In Lithuania, since 1579 the Jesuit- founded Vilnius University spearheaded Counterreformation, eradication of indigenous religion and language. At around the same time in China, Korea and Japan Jesuit missions predated western military incursions by a couple of centuries. The incursions were not only ideological but scientific ‚Äì the Jesuits reformed the Chinese lunisolar calendar in 1645, a change described as ‚Äúpathological‚Äù. 17th-century India deserved a mission to study Brahmanical knowledge and Christianizing missions were dispatched to native North Americans. Jesuit missions were documented in biannual Jesuit Relations: > In \\"Harvest of Souls: The Jesuit Missions and Colonialism in North America, > 1632‚Äì1650\\", Carole Blackburn uses the Jesuit Relations to shed light on the > dialogue between Jesuit missionaries and the Native peoples of northeastern > North America.

(...) Blackburn shows > that this resulted in the displacement of much of the content of the message > and demonstrates that the Native people's acts of resistance took up and > transformed aspects of the Jesuits' teachings in ways that subverted their > authority. In 1721, Jesuit Ippolito Desideri tried to Christianize Tibetans but permission from the Order was not granted. Jesuits themselves participated in economic colonization, founding and operating vast ranches in Peru and Argentina to this day. Jesuit reductions were socialist theocratic settlements for indigenous people specifically in the Rio Grande do Sul area of Brazil, Paraguay and neighbouring Argentina in South America, established by the Jesuit Order early in the 17th century and wound up in the 18th century with the banning of the order in several European countries. A large body of scientific work exists examining entanglements between Jesuit missions, western science emanating from Jesuit-founded universities, colonization and globalization. Since the global Jesuit network grew so large as to necessitate direct connections between branches without passing though Vatican, Jesuit order can be seen as one of the earliest examples of global organizations and globalization. Japan First Christian missionaries arrived in Kyushu in 1542 from Portugal and brought gunpowder with them. Jesuit Francis Xavier arrived in 1550. India The Goa Inquisition was an extension of the Portuguese Inquisition in colonial-era Portuguese India. The Inquisition was established to force conversion to the Roman Catholic Church and maintain Catholic orthodoxy in the Indian dominions of the Portuguese Empire. The institution persecuted Hindus, Muslims, Bene Israels, New Christians and the Judaizing Nasranis by the colonial era Portuguese government and Jesuit clergy in Portuguese India. It was established in 1560, briefly suppressed from 1774 to 1778, continued thereafter and finally abolished in 1820. As was the case elsewhere, physical force and religious propaganda were combined with extractive economic policies. Xenddi was a discriminatory religious tax imposed on Hindus by the colonial era Portuguese Christian government in 17th- century Goa with the pretext that Hindus did not own any land in Goa and only the Christians did. Oppressive and arbitrary, its collection based on severe extortions and abuses, the tax was considered to be an example of religious intolerance by the neighboring Maratha Empire, which made its abolishment a condition for a mutual armistice agreement. Goan government initially refused, stating that the Xenddi tax was a matter of the Church, which the Portuguese state cannot interfere in. Expanded to all of Portuguese colonies in the Indian subcontinent by 1705, the Xenddi tax was abolished in 1840. In India, the British missionaries were often in conflict with British administrators and businessmen. Missionaries had moderate success among the scheduled classes. In French-controlled Vietnam, and a Japanese-controlled Korea, the Christian missionaries had significant success in terms of membership.Samuel Hugh Moffett, A History of Christianity in Asia, Vol. II: 1500‚Äì1900 (2003) online. Christianity had a more subtle effect, reaching far beyond the converted population to potential modernizers. The introduction of European medicine was especially important, as well as the introduction of European political practices and ideals such as religious liberty, mass education, mass printing, newspapers, voluntary organizations, colonial reforms, and especially liberal democracy.Robert D. Woodberry, \\"The missionary roots of liberal democracy.\\" American Political Science Review 106#2 (2012): 244‚Äì274. online Violence against Christians in India can be seen within the context of colonialism. Africa Although there were some earlier small-scale efforts, the major missionary activities from Europe and North America came late in the 19th century, during the Scramble for Africa.Kenneth Scott Latourette, The Great Century: North Africa and Asia 1800 A.D. to 1914 A.D. (A History of The Expansion of Christianity, Volume 6) (1943) pp 301‚Äì464. Christian evangelists were intimately involved in the colonial process in southern Africa. The missionaries discovered increasingly that the medical and educational services they could provide were highly welcome to Africans who were not responsive to theological appeals. When Christian missionaries came to Africa, some native peoples were very hostile and not accepting of the missionaries in Africa. Even though there were some Christian missionaries that went about colonizing the native Africans in unchristian ways there were some missionaries were truly devoted to colonizing through peaceful means and truly thought that the people of Africa needed to be taught that Jesus was their Savior. David Livingstone (1813‚Äì1873), a Scottish missionary, became world-famous in the Anglophone world. He worked after 1840 north of the Orange River with the London Missionary Society, as an explorer, missionary and writer. He became one of the most popular British heroes of the late 19th-century Victorian era. He had a mythical status that operated on a number of interconnected levels: Protestant missionary martyr, inspirational story of rising from the poor, scientific investigator and explorer, imperial reformer, anti-slavery crusader, and advocate of British commercial and colonial expansion. French Catholic missionaries worked in the extensive colonial holdings in Africa. However, in independent Ethiopia (Abyssinia), four French Franciscan sisters arrived in 1897, summoned there by the Capuchin missionaries. By 1925, they were very well-established, running an orphanage, a dispensary, a leper colony and 10 schools with 350 girl students. The schools were highly attractive to upper-class Ethiopians.Pierre Guidi, \\"‚ÄòFor good, God, and the Empire‚Äô: French Franciscan sisters in Ethiopia 1896‚Äì1937.\\" History of Education 47.3 (2018): 384‚Äì398. online In French West Africa in the 1930s, a serious debate emerged between the French missionaries on the one side, and the upper-class local leadership that had been attending French schools in preparation for eventual leadership. Many of them had become Marxists, and French officials worried that they were creating their own Frankenstein monster. The French shifted priorities to set up rural schools for the poor lower classes, and an effort to support indigenous African culture and produce reliable collaborators with the French regime, instead of far-left revolutionaries seeking to overthrow it. The French plan to work through local traditional chiefs. For the same reason they also set up Koranic schools and Muslim areas. The traditional chiefs would be paid larger salaries and have charge of tax collection, local courts, military recruiting, and obtaining forced labor for public works projects. The Governments program seemed a threat to the ambitions of the Marxist locals and they wanted them closed. The Marxist incited labor strikes, amd encouraged immigration to British territories. When the fire-right Petain government came to power in Vichy France in 1940, a high priority was to remove the educated Marxist elite from any positions of authority in French West Africa.James E. Genova, . \\"Conflicted missionaries: power and identity in French West Africa during the 1930s.\\" The Historian 66.1 (2004): 45‚Äì66. Online Long-term impact Walter Rodney a Marxist historian based at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania developed an influential attack on Europe in How Europe Underdeveloped Africa (1972). He mentioned the missionaries: :The Christian missionaries were much part of the colonizing forces as were the explorers, traders and soldiers. There may be room for arguing whether in a given colony the missionaries brought other colonialist forces or vice versa, but there is no doubting the fact that missionaries were agents of colonialism in the practical sense whether or not they saw themselves in that light. According to Heather Sharkey, the real impact of the activities of the missionaries is still a topic open to debate in academia today.Heather J. Sharkey, Cultural Conversions: Unexpected Consequences of Christian Missionary Encounters in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (Syracuse UP, 2013). Sharkey asserted that \\"the missionaries played manifold roles in colonial Africa and stimulated forms of cultural, political and religious change.\\" \\"Historians still debate the nature of their impact and question their relation to the system of European colonialism in the continent.\\" She noted that the missionaries did great good in Africa, providing crucial social services such as modern education and health care that would have otherwise not been available. Sharkey said that, in societies that were traditionally male-dominated, female missionaries provided women in Africa with health care knowledge and basic education.Taimur Khan, \\"Religion in colonial Africa: Professor Heather Sharkey spoke about the role of Christian missionaries in the region\\" The Daily Pennsylvanian Oct 29, 2002  Current Christian perspectives  Pope Francis, a Jesuit, has frequently criticized the colonialism and neocolonialism of the Christian nations of the Global North, referring to colonialism as \\"blasphemy against God\\" and saying that \\"many grave sins were committed against the native peoples of America in the name of God.\\" Speaking with hindsight and on the basis of current theology, Francis said: \\"No actual or established power has the right to deprive peoples of the full exercise of their sovereignty.\\" He also speaks of ‚Äúthe new colonialism [which] takes on different faces. At times it appears as the anonymous influence of mammon: corporations, loan agencies, certain ‚Äòfree trade‚Äô treaties, and the imposition of measures of ‚Äòausterity‚Äô which always tighten the belt of workers and the poor.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Cleall, Esme.

He was the life partner of architect Philip Johnson (1906‚Äì2005) for 45 years until their deaths five months apart. He was also a close friend of Andy Warhol. Early life and Education Whitney, the son of a banker, was raised in Worcester, Massachusetts and attended the Loomis Institute and Woodstock Country School before studying architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating with a BFA in Interior Architecture in 1963. Career During the early to mid-1960s, Whitney had a variety of roles in the contemporary art world. Early jobs at the Museum of Modern Art and several art galleries, including the Green Gallery and the Leo Castelli Gallery, led to him opening his own gallery in 1969.La Prade Eric.

Whitney was also an early member of the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board. Later, he focused on younger artists such as Michael Heizer, Eric Fischl, and David Salle.  Personal Life  While a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Whitney attended a lecture by Johnson at nearby Brown University and approached the architect afterwards, asking for a tour of the Glass House. Their relationship began soon after, and Whitney moved in with Johnson after graduating from college. Whitney died at age 66 on June 12, 2005 at New York- Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, of lung and bone cancer. Whitney bequeathed his estate to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which ultimately raised over $13 million in funds directed specifically to the endowment of the Glass House for its maintenance and operations. In addition, he bequeathed forty-four artworks to the Menil Collection, including 17 drawings by Jasper Johns, Whitney's art library, and his curatorial papers.

It was one of several parochial high schools in the Denver Metropolitan Area. Saint Joseph's High School served students in grades 9 through 12. The entire student body averaged less than 300 students. It was built in one of the original settlement areas of historic Denver. The adjoining Saint Joseph Church is on the National Register of Historic Places. Saint Joseph's High School  History In the early 1900s, Saint Joseph Parish was one of the largest parishes in Denver. It served the area south of Colfax Avenue and west of Cherry Creek. \\"St. Joseph School, which had been squeezing kindergarten through ninth-grade pupils into the church basement, built a $29,000, brick, three-story facility at 601 Fox Street in 1908. A high school program initiated that fall featured a practical business curriculum designed to make its graduates employable.\\" In later years, Saint Joseph Parish was split into Saint Francis to the south and Presentation to the west. The first graduation class from St. Joseph's High School was the class of 1911. There were five students that graduated that year, all girls. Records indicate that there were two graduates in the class of 1913, three from the class of 1915, and five from the class of 1916. The class of 1917 had four graduates, 1918 had one, 1919 and 1920 had three graduates each. The class of 1921 was the largest to date, with nine graduates. It was also the first class with a male graduate. The class of 1929 was the first to publish a yearbook. It featured photographs of the twenty graduating seniors, ten boys and ten girls. Academics Saint Joseph's academic year followed the semester system. This provided for the school's core of college prep, honors, basic courses, and a selection of academic electives. The school also offered foreign language classes in Spanish, German, Latin, and French. There were also music and performing arts classes along with concerts and plays. Its journalism class produced the school newspaper and yearbook The Santa Fe Trail. Sports Parishioners donated much of the labor and materials for the gymnasium, which was constructed in 1950. Saint Joseph earned many team and individual championships in its history. They participated in the Denver Parochial League and then later in the Denver Metro League. Notable achievements were earned in football, basketball, baseball, boxing, and wrestling. The school also had track, cross-country, and golf teams. Saint Joseph Church and Gymnasium God and country \\"During World War II, St. Joseph parish more than proved its patriotism. The church made itself a center for USO activities to comfort and entertain the military. Nuns and parish women taught school children to knit, quilt, and make scrap books that were sent to fighting men overseas. The school's Genes Club, made up of future secretaries and stenographers, sent letters of encouragement to the many men of St. Joseph's at the front. Students also worked on scrap metal and war material drives as well as war bond sales.\\" Saint Joseph alumni have fought and served in the armed forces in every American conflict from World War II to the Persian Gulf War. Closure The Redemptorist parish funded the high school expenses not covered by tuition until its last few years, when the Archdiocese of Denver took over responsibility. Saint Joseph's High School was closed by the Archdiocese of Denver in 1973. Along with Saint Francis and Cathedral high schools, it was merged into a new school, Central Catholic High School; but in 1982 this also was closed. In 1998 the school building became the home of the newly-formed Bienestar Family Services Center, a division of Centro San Juan Diego, the Hispanic ministry of the Archdiocese of Denver.

NBF. Retrieved 2010-11-18. (Acceptance speech by Erskine with some other material.) In 2012 it was awarded the Dolly Gray Children's Literature Award. Plot The book centers around a school shooting. The main character is a 10-year-old girl with Asperger's syndrome named Caitlin Smith who is preoccupied with drawing and dictionaries. Her older brother Devon has just been killed, along with a teacher and another student, in a school shooting. Due to Caitlin's condition, she finds it difficult to cope with her feelings about what has happened. She is awkward and pedantic, seeing things in black and white, and referring to her deceased brother as \\"Devon who is dead\\" when talking to her father. Caitlin's behaviors are perceived as \\"weird.\\" She likes to hide under a dresser and bed, and to stuff her head under the couch cushions. Her classmates don't want to be friends with her due to her \\"weirdness.\\" Her counselor arranges for her to spend recess with the younger kids. She meets a boy named Michael, who is strangely sad over his mother. When she talks to her counselor about it, she tells Caitlin that he is the son of the teacher who was shot. Caitlin discovers the words \\"empathy\\" and \\"closure\\", and determines that this is what she and her distraught father need. She finds it in the form of Devon's Eagle Scout box, which has remained incomplete since his death. Caitlin thinks that if she and her father complete the box, it will bring them closure. With the help of a school counselor and art teacher, although Caitlin is initially antagonistic, she is able to help her father, as well as Michael and the school bully, Josh, the shooter's cousin, to cope. Eventually, Caitlin, Michael, and Josh become friends, more or less. They go together to the dedication ceremony for the people killed in the shooting) The art teacher there gives Caitlin a box of pastels. After the reception, Josh, Michael, and Michael's dad play football, and the novel concludes with Caitlin creating her first colored picture, having previously only drawn in black and white. Reception Common Sense Media found the book to be \\"sensitive, captivating, and, just put simply, a great read.\\" Simon Mason of The Guardian thought that the author's \\"evocation of 'Asperger thinking' is impressive and sensitively managed, but such narrowing of the focus reinforces the story's programmatic nature\\" and concluded, \\"In the end, like Caitlin's drawings, Mockingbird is a neat outline in black and white. It could have done with more color.\\" Kirkus Reviews found that \\"Erskine draws directly and indirectly on To Kill a Mockingbird and riffs on its central theme: The destruction of an innocent is perhaps both the deepest kind of psychosocial wound a community can face and its greatest opportunity for psychological and spiritual growth.\\" At the beginning of the book Erskine dedicated the book to the victims of the Virginia Tech shooting, which happened three years prior.

Contents The Complete Wizard's Handbook is a rules supplement to the 2nd edition Player's Handbook that details magician characters. The book covers three aspects of wizards in detail: their school of magic (such as illusion or necromancy), their \\"wizard kit\\" (subclass, such as mystic, witch, or militant wizard), and their career (such as alchemist or treasure-hunter). The book also includes new spells, and rules for spell research, adjudicating illusions, and casting spells in unusual conditions. The book introduced the wizard kit, a character package for a wizard with role-playing hooks linked to game benefits and limitations. Each kit is built around one recognizable stereotype of a fantasy spell-caster. Examples include the Academician, who suffers a penalty to attack rolls because he lacks a killer instinct, but his scholarly reputation earns him positive reaction bonuses when he meets fellows in his field; the Anagokok, a primitive wizard from a frigid or equatorial climate, who suffers penalties when in a hostile environment, but in his home climate he is masterful, capable of finding food and water in even the most desolate lands, and hardy enough to endure the most brutal weather conditions; and other kits such as the Amazon Sorceress and the Witch. This book also presents these wizards with the option to specialize in one of eight schools of magic from the Player's Handbook. Specialists accept limitations on the variety of spells they can learn in order to gain benefits in casting spells in their areas of specialization. Specialists always have one more spell slot than generalist mages, so long as the extra spell slot is occupied by a spell from the wizard's area of specialization. The book discusses the pros and cons of selecting a generalist mage or a specialist wizard, observing that in short campaigns with slow advancement the specialist benefits are most significant. At higher levels, the modest benefits are overshadowed by abilities gained by level advancement. The Complete Wizard's Handbook also details new official spells. An entire chapter is devoted to a discussion of role-playing and various wizard-character stereotypes, and a \\"Wizardly Lists\\" miscellany is included at the end of the book. Other sections detailed in the book include \\"Combat and the Wizard\\" and \\"Spell Commentary\\". Publication history PHBR4 The Complete Wizard's Handbook was written by Rick Swan and published by TSR in 1990 as a 128-page book. Editing was done by Anne Brown. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed The Complete Wizard's Handbook for Dragon magazine #169 (May 1991). He praised the addition of two strong and well developed female roles (the Amazon Sorceress and the Witch), and highlighted the \\"deliciously obscure and distinctive\\" Anagokok character. Conversely, he criticized the role- playing material as for not being written in a way that would be of immediate use for players, and the \\"Wizardly Lists\\" miscellany to be a \\"sign of incomplete and careless development\\" as the ideas deserved a fuller treatment. Ultimately, while he criticized some of the material as \\"bland and unexciting\\" and of variable use, he deemed it a \\"must have\\" for the wizard kits and new spells. However, he did not consider it Rick Swan's best work and noted that \\"some of the handbook lacks the elegant polish and conviction of the AD&D; 2nd Edition Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide\\".

They are best known for their 1974 debut album, The Children of Lir, a folk opera based on the Irish legend of the same name. The original LP release of the album became one of the most sought after records in Ireland, and ranks among the top 100 rarest records in the world. Loudest Whisper made several albums and over a dozen singles. The group became dormant in the mid-1980s, but reformed in the mid-1990s with a revival of The Children of Lir. They released a new album in 2004. History Loudest Whisper began in Fermoy, Ireland in the early 1960s as The Wizards, a cover band consisting of Brian O'Reilly (guitar, vocals), Michael Clancey (guitar, vocals), John Aherne (bass guitar, vocals) and Jimmy Cotter (drums, vocals). The Wizards played Beatles, Hollies and Spencer Davis songs, before progressing into \\"heavier blues territory\\" when Jimi Hendrix and Cream appeared. In the early 1970s, the band changed their name to \\"Loudest Whisper\\", chosen to reflect both sides of their music, \\"the folky and the heavy\\". Soon after, several personnel changes took place: Cotter left, and Brendan Nelgian (vocals), Ron Kavanagh (guitar, vocals) and Brian O'Reilly's brother Paud O'Reilly (drums) joined. Brian O'Reilly was also a songwriter, influenced by American folk-rock groups like The Lovin' Spoonful and The Mamas & the Papas, but in the early 1970s he began exploring Irish folklore. O'Reilly was particularly interested in the Children of Lir, and in 1972 he composed a Celtic musical based on the Irish legend. The Children of Lir developed into a stage production, and it premiered in Fermoy on 7 January 1973, with Kavanagh performing in the lead role. The musical generated \\"a lot of regional attention\\" and Ireland's national broadcaster, RT√â recorded a ten- minute feature, which it aired on prime time. This exposure resulted in the production moving to other cities, and the Irish division of Polydor Records signing a record deal with Loudest Whisper. Early in 1974 the group recorded their debut album, The Children of Lir, a studio adaption of the musical with producer Leo O'Kelly from T√≠r na n√ìg. The album was, however, rejected by Polydor in the UK and ended up being released in Ireland only in a limited edition of about 500 copies. Kavanagh left Loudest Whisper during the recording of The Children of Lir, and Nelgian left after the album was released. O'Reilly then wrote a second musical, Perseus, based on the Greek legend. For the stage production singer Geraldine Dorgan performed in the main role, and later joined Loudest Whisper as singer/guitarist. She also sang in O'Reilly's third musical, The Maiden of Sorrow in 1975. A live performance of The Maiden of Sorrow was recorded in 1975, but not released until 1995 on CD. Loudest Whisper recorded a number of singles for Polydor Ireland during the mid- and late-1970s, but it was not until 1980 that the label released their second album, Loudest Whisper (later reissued on CD as Loudest Whisper 2), which consisted of some of their singles and new material. Unhappy with Polydor's lack of support, O'Reilly built his own recording studio in Fermoy in 1979 called Fiona. In 1982 the band recorded their third album, Hard Times at Fiona Studio with the addition of a new vocalist, Bernadette Bowes. In 1985 Dorgan and Bowes left the band, and towards the end of the 1980s, Loudest Whisper began to dissolve. O'Reilly continued to write musicals, and staged Buskin' in Fermoy and Cork, which received \\"rave reviews\\". When Riverdance made its appearance in 1994, and proved very successful, Brian O'Reilly decided to restage The Children of Lir, this time with a more \\"folky and Celtic veneer\\". It was also recorded and released in 1994 as The Children of Lir, credited to Brian O'Reilly and Donovan. The original 1974 The Children of Lir recording was released in the UK for the first time by Kissing Spell on CD in 1994. In 2008 Sunbeam Records released Magic Carpet, a six-CD box set that included all the group's albums, singles and some of their early demos. The original 1974 LP release of The Children of Lir has become one of the most sought after records in Ireland, and ranks among the top 100 rarest records in the world. Since the mid-1990s, Loudest Whisper have been performing on and off with different musicians, including as a trio of Brian O'Reilly (guitar, keyboards, vocals), his brother Paud (drums, backing vocals) and Brian's son, Oran (double bass). In 2004 the group released the album, Our World on Fiona Records. and in 2014 they released Blue... Is the Colour on Sunbeam Records Discography Source: Irishrock.org.

The group went to the studio in early 1974 to record The Children of Lir, their first album and a studio adaption of the musical. The album was recorded on weekends at Trend Studios in No 10 Lad Lane, Dublin, because the musicians all had day jobs and had to travel from Fermoy. Leo O'Kelly of Tir Na N-Og produced the album, with Paul Waldron, Trend's house engineer, on the sound desk. Electric and acoustic guitars were used, plus a string quartet and a children's choir, a combination which was \\"very experimental for its time\\". The music was recorded first and the vocals were added later. Because the studio was small, the choir had to be split into boys and girls and recorded separately. Releases When The Children of Lir was completed, it was rejected by Polydor in the UK and ended up being released by Polydor in Ireland only in a limited edition of about 500 copies. It was not until 1994 that the album was released in the UK by Kissing Spell on CD.

Richie Unterberger at AllMusic described the album as \\"respectable if unexceptional folk-rock with tinges of progressive rock\\", and added that it has \\"a slightly lagging-behind-the-times feel in its basic production and earnest na√Øvet√©\\". Unterberger said that the album can be enjoyed without having to follow the story, and that the songs are generally \\"modestly enjoyable\\" on their own.

He founded the Freiburger Vokalensemble, the BosArt Trio, and the Frankfurter Kammerchor.  Career  Born in Staufen im Breisgau, Sch√§fer studied music education, voice and choral conducting in Freiburg im Breisgau, and orchestral conducting in Stuttgart. He was a teacher at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Freiburg from 1971 to 1982. He has been the artistic director of the , which he founded in 1971. In 1982 Sch√§fer was appointed professor for choral conducting at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst Frankfurt am Main (short: HfMDK, Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts), succeeding Helmuth Rilling. In that capacity he conducted both the choir and the chamber choir of the Hochschule. He performed concerts with the chamber choir of the MfMDK at the university and also in the Rhein-Main Region, such as 2007 in St. Martin, Idstein, a program of mostly psalm compositions, Das ist mir lieb (Psalm 116) by Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Warum ist das Licht gegeben dem M√ºhseligen? by Brahms, Eli Eli (based on Psalm 22) of Georgius B√°rdos, Bruckner's Os justi (Psalm 37:19‚Äì20), and Bach's Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden (Psalm 117). Among his students are Peter Reulein, Christoph Siebert and Dan Zerfa√ü. In 2008, after 26 years of teaching, he conducted in a farewell concert Schicksalslied of Brahms and Schubert's Mass in A flat major. Also in 1982 he was the director of the Frankfurter Kantorei, succeeding Kurt Thomas and Rilling. He conducted the choir until 1997. In 2008 he founded the Frankfurter Kammerchor. Sch√§fer has been a juror at international music competitions. He has been the artistic director of the annual Staufener Musikwoche in his hometown. Since his student days, Sch√§fer has also been a member of the musical comedy group BosArt Trio. In 1984 Sch√§fer conducted the premiere of the Mass of Kurt Hessenberg with the Frankfurter Kantorei in the studio of the Hessischer Rundfunk. In 1990 he recorded Telemann's cantata Die Tageszeiten with Mechthild Bach, Mechthild Georg, Hans Peter Blochwitz, Johannes Mannov, the Freiburger Vokalensemble and Collegium Musicum, the second commercial recording of the cantata. In 2003 he recorded Telemann's Passion Das selige Erw√§gen des bittern Leiden und Sterbens Jesu Christi with Barbara Locher, Zeger Vandersteene, Stefan D√∂rr, Berthold Possemeyer, Jesus- Rene Schmidt, the Freiburger Vokalensemble and L'arpa festante, then probably the only recording of the work. After retiring from the Musikhochschule Frankfurt, Sch√§fer founded the Frankfurter Kammerchor, mostly formed by alumni of the Hochschule. He conducted the chamber choir in concerts in the Limburg Cathedral, St. Martin, Idstein, and the Stiftskirche, Stuttgart, among others. He designed a program for Advent which includes several settings of Ave Maria and Jan Sandstr√∂m's Es ist ein Ros entsprungen.

Moselle grew up in Wisconsin and attended University of Wisconsin-Superior (UWS) starting in 1946 after serving two years in the U.S. Army during World War II. Playing as a halfback for the school's football team, he set a number of records, including most rushing yards in a career and most touchdowns in a game, season and career. He was the team's captain and was chosen as an all-conference player. The NFL's Cleveland Browns selected him in the later rounds of the 1950 draft after he was recommended to Cleveland head coach Paul Brown by the coach of one of his opponents in college. The Browns won the NFL championship in 1950, but Moselle was traded the following year to the Green Bay Packers. He played two seasons in Green Bay and one season for the Philadelphia Eagles before playing a final season in the Canadian Football League for the Calgary Stampeders in 1955. After ending his playing career, Moselle got a master's degree in education and coached at Wabash College for three years. He then moved back to UWS as a teacher and coach, staying at his alma mater until he retired in 1986. He was inducted into the UWS hall of fame in 1973 and into the Superior Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. Moselle died in 2010. Early life and college Moselle was born in Gile, Wisconsin and attended Hurley High School, where he played basketball, baseball and football. After graduating in 1943, he joined the U.S. Army and served in Guam and Hawaii during World War II between 1944 and 1945. When the war ended, he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Superior, then known as Superior State Teachers College, where he studied health and physical education. Playing as a halfback on the school's Yellowjackets football team between 1946 and 1949, Moselle set school records for rushing yards in a career, with 2,652 on 491 carries. He also set a single-season school rushing record in 1948 with 962 yards. He still holds the record for most touchdowns in a game, season and career, as well as for kickoff returns for touchdowns. He was the football team's captain, and was named an all- Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference player in football and basketball. Professional career Moselle was selected by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) in the 23rd round of the 1950 draft after he was recommended to head coach Paul Brown by one of his opposing college coaches. He was the first player from the Wisconsin State University system to be drafted into the NFL. In the Browns, Moselle joined a team transitioning into the NFL after four years and four championship victories in the All-America Football Conference. Led by quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, the Browns finished the season with a 10‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record and won the NFL championship over the Los Angeles Rams. Moselle returned kicks and served as a backup halfback for the Browns, rushing for 39 yards. He also played as a defensive back. Brown traded Moselle to the Green Bay Packers in 1951 along with linebacker Walt Michaels and several other players in exchange for the rights to tackle Bob Gain. Moselle played the following two seasons for Green Bay, but the team finished no better than fourth place in the NFL's National division. After a season away from the NFL, he played with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1954. The Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League bought Moselle from the Eagles in 1955, and he played there for one season. Later life and death Moselle earned a master's degree in education from Indiana State University after his playing career, and then spent three years teaching and coaching football and basketball at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He resigned in 1961 to take a job at the University of Wisconsin-Superior, his alma mater. He taught physical education there and coached the school's football, baseball, basketball and track teams. Moselle resigned as the basketball coach in 1970 to devote more of his time to teaching. He retired in 1986. Moselle was inducted into the University of Wisconsin-Superior hall of fame in 1973 and the Superior Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He and his wife, Patricia O'Keefe, had three children. He died in 2010.

In it, Maxwell derived the equations of electromagnetism in conjunction with a \\"sea\\" of \\"molecular vortices\\" which he used to model Faraday's lines of force. Maxwell had studied and commented on the field of electricity and magnetism as early as 1855/6 when \\"On Faraday's Lines of Force\\"On Faraday‚Äôs Lines of Force‚Äô by James Clerk Maxwell 1855 was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Maxwell made an analogy between the density of this medium and the magnetic permeability, as well as an analogy between the transverse elasticity and the dielectric constant, and using the results of a prior experiment by Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch performed in 1856, he established a connection between the speed of light and the speed of propagation of waves in this medium. The paper ushered in a new era of classical electrodynamics and catalyzed further progress in the mathematical field of vector calculus. Because of this, it is considered one of the most historically significant publications in physics and science in general, comparable with Einstein's Annus Mirabilis papers and Newton's Principia Mathematica. Motivations In 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch performed an experiment with a Leyden jar and established the ratio of electric charge as measured statically to the same electric charge as measured electrodynamically. Maxwell used this ratio in Isaac Newton's equation for the speed of sound, as applied using the density and transverse elasticity of his sea of molecular vortices. He obtained a value which was very close to the speed of light, as recently measured directly by Hippolyte Fizeau. Maxwell then wrote > \\"we can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse > undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic > phenomena\\" It was also in this 1861 paper that Maxwell first introduced the displacement current term which is now included in Amp√®re's circuital law. But it wasn't until his next paper in 1865, \\"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\\" that Maxwell used this displacement current term to derive the electromagnetic wave equation. :\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mu_0\\\\mathbf{J} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\mu_0 \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial t}\\\\mathbf{E}}_\\\\mathrm{Maxwell's \\\\ term} Impact The four modern Maxwell's equations, as laid down in a publication by Oliver Heaviside in 1884, had all appeared in Maxwell's 1861 paper. Heaviside however presented these equations in modern vector format using the nabla operator (‚àá) devised by William Rowan Hamilton in 1837, Of Maxwell's work, Albert Einstein wrote: > \\"Imagine [Maxwell's] feelings when the differential equations he had > formulated proved to him that electromagnetic fields spread in the form of > polarised waves, and at the speed of light! To few men in the world has such > an experience been vouchsafed... it took physicists some decades to grasp > the full significance of Maxwell's discovery, so bold was the leap that his > genius forced upon the conceptions of his fellow-workers.\\" Other physicists were equally impressed with Maxwell's work, such as Richard Feynman who commented: > \\"From a long view of the history of the world‚Äîseen from, say, ten thousand > years from now‚Äîthere can be little doubt that the most significant event of > the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of > electromagnetism. The American Civil War will pale into provincial > insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the > same decade.\\" Charles Coulston Gillispie states that the paper introduced the word \\"field\\" to the world of physics, but Faraday first coined the term in 1849.

The Princess faints from horrible shock. The news gets out to the land and a witch summons the bearded dwarves to receive the ingredients of the antidote (the bags that appear at the end of each stage) and turn the Prince back to normal so they may continue the royal wedding.  Gameplay  Similar to the original Don Doko Don, the player controls Bob, a bearded dwarf wielding a hammer to flatten enemies and throw them. But unlike the original, this version is single-player only and a side- scroller. The game consists of five stages, each having a boss battle at the end. The player's goal is to reach the end of each stage, defeat a boss and collect a bag containing an ingredient for the antidote to advance to the next stage.

The film was directed by Malcolm Marmorstein, who also wrote the screenplay. Plot Dwight Putnum (Roger Rose) has just asked Kendall Gordon (Kimberly Foster) for the 10th time to marry him, but Kendall is still unwilling to commit. She has this idea that the perfect man for her is still out there. Vampire Zachary Simms (Adam Ant) has just awakened in his coffin from a 100-year sleep in the crypt under Kendall's house and comes out through the secret door in her fireplace to face the brave, new world. When the two meet, it isn't quite love at first bite, but Zachary spends the next day in her bed anyway. This angers Dwight when he tries to put the make on Zachary, thinking the lump under the covers is Kendall. It doesn't take long before Kendall and Zachary become friends, and Zachary tells her how he came to be a vampire. He was born in England in 1660 and moved to Boston in 1675. In 1688, he was bitten by a vampire named Nerissa, and they lived together for 100 years before she suddenly decided to run off with a Washington politician. Zachary pined for Nerissa for the next one hundred years and finally decided to sleep it off. Unfortunately, he forgot to wake up until another one hundred years had passed. Zachary is entranced by such devices as refrigerators, electric light bulbs, and cars that talk. Zachary is also entranced by Kendall, and before long, they are a twosome. Zachary decides to end his existence as a vampire and asks Kendall to help him in 'reviving his digestive system' so that he can eat human food. Before long, Zachary is slurping down spaghetti and munching on pizza. When he finds that he has a blood pressure, can go outside in the daytime, and drinking blood makes him gag, he proclaims himself 'rehumanized.' Everything is going great, until 1) Zachary lands a job with Dwight's insurance firm, 2) Dwight hires Vinnie Helsting (Philip Bruns) to do a little detective work on Zachary, and 3) Nerissa (Michelle Forbes) shows up wanting Zachary back. Zachary starts working the night shift in the data entry department. One night he discovers $1,300,000 that has been moving from department to department in small increments. Dwight rewards him for his find by making him an executive vice president and giving him a company car. Within a short time, Zachary is using his bloodthirsty skills to put the bite on potential clients, proving that he can make a killing in the business. Unfortunately, he's spending less and less time with Kendall and becoming more and more of a yuppie. When Zachary suggests to the board of directors a plan that will increase their profits 30% each year for 100 years, they make him chief executive officer of the company, which effectively puts Dwight out of a job. While Zachary is rapidly moving up the ladder, Helsting can't find anything on him. No birth certificate, no credit cards, no paper trail, so he begins tailing Zachary wherever he goes, taking photographs, and casing the house Zachary shares with Kendall. One night, when no one is home, Helsting enters the house, notices the secret door in the fireplace, and discovers the crypt and Zachary's coffin. While there, he overhears Zachary's message machine taking a phone call. 'Hello. I can't come to the phone right now. I'm dead.' Then Nerissa comes on, warning Zachary to be careful so that Dwight doesn't find out what Zachary really is. Helsting puts two and two together and figures it out...Zachary is a vampire. It looks like Zachary is about to be defanged. Dwight wants his business back. Kendall says Zachary was more human when he was a vampire and wants him out of her life. Nerissa says that the only solution is to 'revamp' him, so she gets the process started by biting him on the neck. Dwight takes back his business, setting up Zachary as a consultant with a perpetual income that will make him rich for centuries. Kendall informs Zachary that she is pregnant with his baby and agrees to allow him to 'vampirize' her when the baby is old enough to understand. Nerissa agrees to become the baby's godmother and buy her pretty dresses and take her to Mets night games.

On Prospect Bluff, overlooking the Apalachicola River, a settlement and fortification that Andrew Jackson and other white Americans labeled Negro Fort existed for a brief period. It was built by the British in 1814, during the War of 1812, in a remote part of what was at the time Spanish Florida. It is part of the Prospect Bluff Historic Sites, in the Apalachicola National Forest, Franklin County, Florida. The term \\"Negro Fort\\" was coined by the Americans only after the British Army had departed Florida in the aftermath of the Treaty of Ghent in 1815; its later residents were primarily blacks, either being free Negroes or fugitive slaves, residing together with some Choctaws. There were a significant number of fugitive slaves already in the area before the fort was built, and beginning in 1804 there was for several years a trading post operating in the settlement. The blacks, having been slaves that worked on plantation, knew how to plant and care for crops, and also to care for domesticated animals, mostly cattle. When withdrawing in 1815, the local British commander, the Irishman Edward Nicolls, intentionally left the fully armed fort in the hands of the blacks who had served alongside the British during the War of 1812 and paid off a group of Colonial Marines, who along with their Creek allies resided in and took part in the defense of the fort. As Nicolls hoped, the fort became a center of resistance to slavery near the Southern border of the United States. The site was militarily significant, being a military fort, although without artillery training, the residents of the fort were ultimately unable to defend themselves from potential U.S. incursions. It is the largest and most well-known instance before the American Civil War in which armed black slaves resisted whites who sought to return them to slavery (a much smaller example was Fort Mose, near St. Augustine). The fort was destroyed in 1816 at the command of General Andrew Jackson. The American forces used heated shot against the fort and ignited the powder magazine, blowing up the fort and killing over 270 people instantly. However, the area continued to attract escaped slaves until the U.S. construction of Fort Gadsden in 1818. Negro Fort The \\"Negro Fort\\", as it soon came to be called, became widely known among the inhabitants of the region. It offered a safe refuge to anyone who wished to flee from the United States, whether they be escaped slaves, who were safe once they reached Spanish Florida, or Native Americans, fleeing White American settlement on their lands. The pro-slavery press in the United States expressed outrage at the existence of Negro Fort. This concern was published in the Savannah Journal: > It was not to be expected that an establishment so pernicious to the > Southern states, holding out to a part of their population temptations to > insubordination, would have been suffered to exist after the close of the > war [of 1812]. In the course of last winter, several slaves from this > neighborhood fled to that fort; others have lately gone from Tennessee and > the Mississippi Territory. How long shall this evil, requiring immediate > remedy, be permitted to exist? Escaped slaves came from as far as Virginia. The Apalachicola, as was true of other rivers of north Florida, was a base for raiders who attacked Georgia plantations, stealing anything portable and helping the slaves escape. To guard this portion of the U.S. border, in April 1816 the U.S. Army decided to build Fort Scott on the Flint River, a tributary of the Apalachicola. Supplying the fort was challenging because transporting materials overland would have required traveling through unsettled wilderness. The obvious route to supply the Fort was the river. Although technically this was Spanish territory, Spain had neither the resources nor the inclination to protect this remote area. Supplies going to or from the newly built Fort Scott would have to pass directly in front of the Negro Fort. The boats carrying supplies for the new fort, the Semelante and the General Pike, were escorted by gunboats sent from Pass Christian. The defenders of the fort ambushed sailors gathering fresh water, killing three and capturing one (who was subsequently burned alive); only one escaped. When the U.S. boats attempted to pass the fort on April 27 they were fired upon.Casualties: U. S. Navy and Marine Corps Personnel Killed and Wounded in Wars, Conflicts, Terrorist Acts, and Other Hostile Incidents , Naval Historical Center, United States Navy. This event provided a casus belli for destroying Negro Fort. Jackson requested permission to attack, and started preparations. Ten days later, Andrew Jackson ordered Brigadier General Edmund P. Gaines at Fort Scott to destroy Negro Fort. The U.S. expedition included Creek Indians from Coweta, who were induced to join by the promise that they would get salvage rights to the fort if they helped in its capture. On July 27, 1816, following a series of skirmishes, the U.S. forces and their Creek allies launched an all-out attack under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Duncan Clinch, with support from a naval convoy commanded by Sailing Master Jarius Loomis. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams justified the attack and subsequent seizure of Spanish Florida by Andrew Jackson as national \\"self-defense\\", a response to Spanish helplessness and British involvement in fomenting the \\"Indian and Negro War\\". Adams produced a letter from a Georgia planter complaining about \\"brigand Negroes\\" who made \\"this neighborhood extremely dangerous to a population like ours.\\" Southern leaders worried that the Haitian Revolution or a parcel of Florida land occupied by a few hundred blacks could threaten the institution of slavery. On July 20, Clinch and the Creek allies left Fort Scott to assault Negro Fort but stopped short of firing range, realising that artillery (gunboats) would be needed. Battle of Negro Fort plaque at the site of Negro Fort marking the location of the powder magazine The Battle of Negro Fort was the first major engagement of the Seminole Wars period and marked the beginning of General Andrew Jackson's conquest of Florida. Three leaders of the fort had come with Nicolls (since departed) from Pensacola. They were: Gar√ßon (\\"boy\\"), 30, a carpenter and former slave in Spanish Pensacola, valued at 750 pesos ; Prince, 26, a master carpenter valued at 1,500 pesos, who had received wages and an officer's commission from the British in Pensacola; and Cyrus, 26, also a carpenter, and literate. Prince may have been the military commander of the same name at the head of 90 free blacks brought from Havana to assist the Spanish defense in St. Augustine during the Patriot War of 1812. As the U.S. expedition drew near the fort on July 27, 1816, black militiamen had already been deployed and began skirmishing with the column before regrouping back at their base. At the same time the gunboats under Master Loomis moved upriver to a position for a siege bombardment. Negro Fort was occupied by about 330 people during the time of battle. At least 200 were maroons, armed with ten cannons and dozens of muskets. Some were former Colonial Marines. They were accompanied by thirty or so Seminole and Choctaw warriors under a chief. The remaining were women and children, the families of the black militia. Before beginning an engagement General Gaines first requested a surrender. Gar√ßon, the leader of the fort, a former Colonial Marine, refused. Gar√ßon told Gaines that he had orders from the British military to hold the post and at the same time raised the Union Jack and a red flag to symbolize that no quarter would be given. The Americans considered the Negro Fort to be heavily defended; after they formed positions around one side of the post, the Navy gunboats were ordered to start the bombardment. Then the defenders opened fire with their cannons, but they had no training and did not know how to handle artillery, and were thus unable to utilise their artillery in any meaningful respect. It was daytime when Master Jarius Loomis ordered his gunners to open fire. After five to nine rounds were fired to check the range, the first round of hot shot cannonball, fired by Navy Gunboat No. 154, entered the Fort's powder magazine. The ensuing explosion was massive, and destroyed the entire Fort. Almost every source states all but about 60 of the 334 occupants of the Fort were instantly killed, and others died of their wounds shortly after, including many women and children. A more recent scholar says the number killed was \\"probably no more than forty\\", the remainder having fled before the attack. The explosion was heard more than 100 miles (160 km) away in Pensacola. Just afterward, the U.S. troops and the Creeks charged and captured the surviving defenders. Only three escaped injury; two of the three, an Indian and a Black person, were executed at Jackson's orders. General Gaines later reported that: Gar√ßon, the black commander, and the Choctaw chief, among the few who survived, were handed over to the Creeks, who shot Gar√ßon and scalped the chief. African-American survivors were returned to slavery. There were no white casualties from the explosion. The Creek salvaged 2,500 muskets, 50 carbines, 400 pistols, and 500 swords from the ruins of the fort, increasing their power in the region. The Seminole, who had fought alongside the blacks, were conversely weakened by the loss of their allies. The Creek participation in the attack increased tension between the two tribes.Mahon, 23. Seminole anger at the U.S. for the fort's destruction contributed to the breakout of the First Seminole War a year later.Mahon, 24. Spain protested the violation of its soil, but according to historian John K. Mahon, it \\"lacked the power to do more.\\"Mahon, 23-24. Aftermath The largest group of survivors, including blacks from the surrounding plantations who were not at the Fort, took refuge further south, in Angola. Some other refugees founded Nicholls Town in the Bahamas. Gar√ßon was executed by firing squad because of his responsibility for the earlier killing of the watering party, and the Choctaw Chief was handed over to the Creeks, who scalped him. Some survivors were taken prisoner and placed into slavery under the claim that Georgia slaveowners had owned the ancestors of the prisoners. Neamathla, a leader of the Seminole at Fowltown, was angered by the death of some of his people at Negro Fort so he issued a warning to General Gaines that if any of his forces crossed the Flint River, they would be attacked and defeated. The threat provoked the general to send 250 men to arrest the chief in November 1817 but a battle arose and it became an opening engagement of the First Seminole War. Anger over the destruction of the fort stimulated continued resistance during the First Seminole War.

It was of unusual layout, with two buried piston engines driving a single pusher propeller. Only a single example was built, which flew only twice, as it proved too expensive to be commercially viable. Design and development During the early 1940s, Douglas Aircraft Corporation developed a configuration for high-performance twin-engined aircraft, in which the engines were buried in the fuselage, driving propellers mounted behind a conventional tailplane, in order to reduce drag by eliminating drag inducing objects such as engines from the wing. This layout was first demonstrated in the Douglas XB-42 Mixmaster bomber, which first flew in 1944, showing a 30% reduction in drag compared with a conventional twin- engined layout, while eliminating handling problems due to asymmetric thrust when flying on one engine.Francillon 1979, pp. 372‚Äì377. Owing to the initial success of the XB-42, Douglas adopted this promising new layout for a medium- range airliner, the DC-8Francillon 1979, pp. 714‚Äì715. and a five-seat light aircraft suitable for executive or air charter use, the Model 1015 or Cloudster II.\\"Tail-Pusher Plane Cruises 200 M.P.H.\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1947, p. 103. The Cloudster II was a low-winged monoplane with a retractable nosewheel undercarriage. The pilot and four passengers sat in an enclosed cabin well ahead of the unswept, laminar flow wing. Two air-cooled piston engines were buried in the rear fuselage, driving a single eight foot diameter twin-bladed propeller, mounted behind the empennage via driveshafts taken from P-39 fighters. Two air intakes forward of the wing directed cooling air to the engines, which then exhausted beneath the fuselage.\\"Douglas numeric, and A thru C.\\" Aerofiles. Retrieved: November 18, 2010. Operational history The Cloudster II made its maiden flight on March 12, 1947. Although the aircraft's performance and handling were good, it suffered from excessive vibration, and overheated when it was on the ground. Further development was abandoned late in 1947, with the prototype having flown only twice, as the post-war civil flying market had not developed as hoped, while the selling price had risen from an originally planned $30,000 to $68,000, rendering the aircraft commercially unviable.\\"Here and There: Abandoned.\\" Flight, August 28, 1947, p. 220.

It was intended to connect railways on Staten Island (precursors to the modern-day Staten Island Railway) to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, in Brooklyn, via a new crossing under the Narrows. Planned to extend , the tunnel would have been among the world's longest at the time of its planning, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Construction began in 1923, and the tunnel was excavated into the Narrows before New York City Mayor John Hylan, a former Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) employee and initial proponent of the tunnel, canceled the project in 1925. The tunnel lies dormant under Owl's Head Park in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Later proposals to complete the tunnel, including the 1939 plans for the Independent Subway System's ambitious Second System, were never funded. Modern proposals for completion of the tunnel have come from New York City Councilman Lewis Fidler, who in 2007 proposed a 0.33% tax for the tri-state region to pay for the construction. The tunnel was listed as one of many projects that could receive federal funds that were to have been allocated to the Access to the Region's Core tunnel, which was canceled in October 2010. State Senator Diane Savino was among the supporters of the tunnel; Savino stated that if built, the tunnel would cost $3 billion and would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment. Other names Officially called the Brooklyn-Richmond Freight and Passenger Tunnel, the Staten Island Tunnel was also to be referred to by four other names: * The Narrows Tunnel, after the Narrows, the body of water it was supposed to run under; * The Saint George Tunnel, after one of its terminals in St. George, Staten Island (not to be confused with the tunnel between the terminal and the Tompkinsville station); * The Hylan Tunnel, after former New York City Mayor John Hylan, who oversaw the project. It has also been referred to as Hylan's Holes in both derogatory and endearing contexts. Original plans In 1888, subsequent to building the Arthur Kill swing bridge between New Jersey and northwestern Staten Island, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (the owners of the Staten Island Railway until 1971) proposed a tunnel between Staten Island and Brooklyn. In 1890, Staten Island developer Erastus Wiman, who controlled the railway, sponsored a plan by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to construct a tunnel under the Narrows to connect Staten Island with Brooklyn for both passenger and freight service. The proposal never made it through the approval process when financial challenges stopped the plan at the drawing board. The tunnel would have gone near the foot of Vanderbilt Avenue on Staten Island to Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, traveling at a depth of below the narrows. There would have been two lines of tunneling, parallel and close together. Wiman believed that the tunneling would cost $5 million and that with the connecting road, the total cost was estimated at $6 million. A rapid transit route to connect Staten Island to the remainder of New York City was proposed in 1912, in conjunction with the Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At the time, there were no vehicular or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only connection was by ferry. Although not funded by the city, the tunnel was expected to help expand the then-sparsely populated borough in a similar manner to the population and development explosions seen in Brooklyn and the Bronx. Under the Dual Contracts, three routes were proposed‚Äîtwo to Brooklyn and one to Manhattan‚Äîwhich would connect the Staten Island Railway's rapid transit service (SIRT) to existing subway lines. Manhattan route The Manhattan proposal, often called the \\"direct route,\\" would have connected with the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s lines under Battery Park, near the current Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel. \\"Direct Route A\\" would have utilized a five-section tunnel under the New York Harbor, while \\"Direct Route B\\" would have used a partially-elevated route running along the eastern coastline of New Jersey (near Greenville and Bayonne). Both Manhattan plans would have required connections to various points, including Ellis Island or Governors Island, and would have traveled around without any stops. Because of this, the high costs of the potential tunnel, and the relatively small population of Staten Island, the Manhattan route was considered impractical. Another 5-mile tunnel to Battery Park was proposed by the city in the 1950s, but the plan was scrapped due to a lack of funding. Brooklyn routes Both of the shorter, Brooklyn proposals would have connected to the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)'s Fourth Avenue subway, constructed in 1914 during the Dual Contracts. The first route would have originated in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn at a point between 65th and 67th Streets (just south of 59th Street Station), running to Arrietta Street in Tompkinsville, Staten Island near the Tompkinsville Station and one stop away from the Saint George Terminal. This plan, referred to as \\"Route No. 51\\" under the Dual Contracts, would have had connections going north towards St. George and along the North Shore Branch towards Arlington, and south towards Tottenville on the Main Line and Wentworth Avenue along the South Beach Branch. This proposal was estimated to cost $12 million in the year 1912, with half of it to be paid by railroads, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad (which operated the Long Island Rail Road) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (which operated the SIRT). A major part of the 1912 proposal was the inclusion of two 40-inch water mains, which were to be side by side and were to be installed by the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity alongside the tubes. These mains were intended to carry water from the main New York City supply to Staten Island. The second route would have originated in Fort Hamilton at the south end of the line. Similar to the 1890 proposal, it would have followed the routing of the current Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge (constructed from 1959 to 1964). The Fort Hamilton proposal was the shortest route of the two, though it would require tunneling through deeper waters. As part of the proposal, it was suggested that the Fourth Avenue Line be extended past its original terminal at 86th Street in Bay Ridge to a temporary ferry terminal at 95th Street (now the 95th Street Station). In anticipation of the northern tunnel route, trackways were constructed diverging from both Fourth Avenue local tracks towards the tunnel site south of the 59th Street Station. An additional portal was built in the SIRT tunnel between St. George Terminal and Tompkinsville to facilitate the northern wye from the tunnel to the North Shore Branch. As a provision for the southern route, the Fourth Avenue line south of 59th Street (built with only two tracks) was placed on the west side of Fourth Avenue, which would allow two additional tracks to be added on the east side of the street to facilitate a future express service from Staten Island. Groundbreaking and stoppage of construction=Selection of Bay Ridge- based plan The Bay Ridge-based plan was ultimately selected, running between 65th Street/Shore Road in Brooklyn and the St. George Ferry Terminal in Staten Island. The two tubes would have been long, longer than any tunnel in the United States at that time. Portions of the Bay Ridge tunnel would be constructed using a tunnelling shield, while the remainder would be placed in a trench at the bottom of the Narrows. In the final plans, each tunnel was designed to be wide to accommodate freight cars in addition to passenger service, with freight trains coming from the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)'s Bay Ridge Branch (terminating just north of the tunnel site) and the Staten Island Railway's connection with rail lines from New Jersey. Alternate plans included constructing two sets of two tubes, one for commuter and freight service from the LIRR and the other for rapid transit, or two tunnels each with individual tubes for freight and subway service. The freight service would have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint freight and passenger service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.). At the time of the tunnel's groundbreaking, Jamaica Bay and the Paerdegat Basin were slated to become industrial complexes, which would have been facilitated by freight service from the tunnel. The tunnel plan was amended in 1919. In April 1921, a bill was passed in the state senate requiring the city to begin construction of the tunnel within two years. 1922 plan In May 1922, John Hylan launched a new plan for the freight and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4.08 million be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority refused to accept the plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the original plan. The original plan would have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard. Under the new plan, freight would still only operate at night through the tunnel. Spurs connecting the tunnel in Brooklyn to the Long Island freight belt line, to the B&O; freight sidings on Staten Island, and to the new city piers on Staten Island would have all been built. The project was projected to cost $60 million and if the job was done quickly, it could have been done by 1929. The route would help develop the waterfront areas in Staten Island and Jamaica Bay. Provisions would be made for connections with the subway system's Fourth Avenue Line, even though the Transit Commission refused to be involved with the plans. Since the plan would benefit the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad opposed it, and the railroad, cooperating with the Port Authority, proposed a tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey, with a spur to Staten Island. The situation become complicated, as the Port Authority plan was approved by the State Legislatures in both New Jersey and New York. In addition, the Transit Commission proposed its own subway tunnel branching from the Fourth Avenue Line to be operated as part of the city's subway system. Groundbreaking and preparations A groundbreaking ceremony was held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge and in Staten Island on July 19. Headings were dug and tunneling shafts were sunk at 68th Street and Shore Road in Brooklyn (the Shore Road Shaft), and underneath the Saint George Terminal in Staten Island (the South Street Shaft), costing a total of $1 million. On March 4, 1924, one of the caissons for the tunnel was sunk. In addition, in preparation for the tunnel, the SIRT purchased one hundred ME-1 subway cars built to BMT specifications and electrified its three passenger branches. The impending completion of the tunnel also sparked real estate interests in Staten Island. Construction halted In 1925, however‚Äîthe year bids from contractors were to be entertained by the city‚Äîthe project was halted and the project's engineering staff laid off. Officially, the plan was delayed due to lack of funding, but Hylan and New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) Chairman John Delaney also wanted to secure freight service for the tunnel. The status of the tunnel as mixed-use created tension and deadlock between Hylan, Delaney and the New York State Transit Commission; the latter emphasized passenger service for the tunnel. After an investigation issued by Governor Al Smith, planners eliminated freight service from the plan, as per the Nicoll-Hofstadter Act signed into law by the governor; this then led to lack of interest from contractors. With the tunnel now designated exclusively for subway service, Mayor Hylan, a former Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) employee who was a known opponent of both the BMT and the IRT, supposedly stopped the project as part of an overall effort to cripple the two private subway companies and promote the plans for the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND). It was also reported that Governor Smith, who had a financial stake in the Pennsylvania Railroad company, tried to stall the project in order to prevent the expansion of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad operations farther into the city. The stoppage was also attributed to the political rivalry between Hylan and Smith, who were both members of Tammany Hall's Democratic Party. Nonetheless, on October 2, 1925, the 95th Street subway station, which was built mainly in anticipation for the Staten Island Tunnel, was opened. The station was built with a false wall at its south end, intended for either a planned extension to 100th or 101st Streets or a line leading to a future Fort Hamilton-based tunnel. Completion proposals The 1939 IND Second System plan, showing the proposed Staten Island Tunnel connection with the IND Culver Line. The tunnel had gone only into the Narrows before it was halted; multiple proposals have resurfaced to complete the tunnel. The tunnel and the Shore Road tunneling shafts currently lie dormant under Owl's Head Park in Bay Ridge. The South Street Shaft in Staten Island was filled in 1946 during post-World War II renovations of Saint George Terminal. The IND Second System proposal from 1929 estimated that the cost of the southern tunnel route from Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, to Fort Hamilton would cost upward of $75 million, though the tunnel was not officially part of the subway plans and was illustrated as a vehicular tunnel on the map of the plans.Board of Transportation of the City of New York Engineering Department, Proposed Additional Rapid Transit Lines And Proposed Vehicular Tunnel, dated August 23, 1929 Many of the proposals were part of this ambitious expansion plan, which would have connected the tunnel to the IND South Brooklyn Line (today's IND Culver Line). An updated proposal in 1931 had the connection to the IND at the current Smith-Ninth Streets station, with the tunnel traveling north from Staten Island through Red Hook and Gowanus. Yet another update, from 1933, was projected to cost $45 million, running the original route between Saint George and 67th Street in Bay Ridge. The line would then run on Second Avenue north through the Bay Ridge Flats on Brooklyn's western shore, meeting up with the Culver Line near Hamilton Avenue (the current Gowanus Expressway) between the Smith-Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue stations; it was suggested that the Hylan tunnel shafts be used. An application for a $47 million loan for this extension was approved by the Board of Estimate in 1937. A revised Second System plan, drawn up in 1939 after the completion of the South Brooklyn line, followed the original Bay Ridge plan, and would have also extended the IND down Fort Hamilton Parkway and/or 10th Avenue to meet up with the tunnel route.Project for Expanded Rapid Transit Facilities, New York City Transit System, dated July 5, 1939 The IND connection would be located at either the Fort Hamilton Parkway station (where the express tracks of the line run on a separate level directly under the street) or the Church Avenue express station, the former terminus of the line. The Church Avenue connection would have utilized the lower level yard just south of the station, currently used to relay terminating trains. None of these plans were ever funded, due to the onset of the Great Depression and, subsequently, World War II. In 1945, the tunnel between New Brighton and the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn was submitted by the Board of Transportation to the City Planning Commission as part of the 1946 budget, this time costing $50.61 million. Later in 1945, according to a report by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's special committee on transportation requirements of the Borough of Richmond, it was deemed that a tunnel to Staten Island from Manhattan was \\"unthinkable\\" and that a tunnel between Brooklyn and Staten Island was \\"not feasible now but must wait ten years\\". Robert Moses, who was the chairman of the committee and a known mass transit opponent, said that the best hope for improved transportation between Staten Island and Brooklyn and Manhattan was the reconstruction of the Saint George Terminal, the placing of more and better boats between Staten Island and Manhattan, resumption of 24-hour ferry service between 39th Street in Brooklyn and Staten Island, and the construction of ramps to the Gowanus elevated improvement at 39th Street. More recently, the Verrazzano‚ÄìNarrows Bridge, built from 1959 to 1964, had been proposed to serve as the rail link. The 95th Street station was slated to be connected to the bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, because it followed the route of the planned tunnel. However, no space for any tracks was ever built because of Moses's opposition to the expansion of New York City public transportation. Modern proposals for completion of the tunnel have come from New York City Councilman Lewis A. Fidler, who in 2007 proposed a one-third of one percent tax for the tri-state region to pay for the construction. The tunnel was one of several projects that could have competed for $3 billion of federal funds that were to have been allocated to the ARC tunnel, which was canceled by New Jersey governor Chris Christie in October 2010. State Senator Diane Savino, whose district includes parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn, supported such a plan, saying, \\"The MTA should complete a 1912 plan that would have rail and freight access from the terminus of Victory Boulevard to Brooklyn, along 67th Street, then utilize the train along Fourth Avenue.\\" The plan's projected cost would be $3 billion, \\"the same as a proposed extension of the 7 line under the Hudson River\\". Supporters stated that a rail tunnel would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.  Similar proposals = Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel  Map of the plans for the Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel The nearby Cross- Harbor Rail Tunnel is being planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tunnel is being planned as a result of passenger and commuter traffic frequencies being at capacity and precluding freight movements. As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather than just the Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could cost up to $11 billion to build, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in November 2014.CHFP draft Tier 1 EIS  Tunnels from Brooklyn to New Jersey via Staten Island  The former Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) also planned a railroad tunnel, for freight use, between Brooklyn and Staten Island in 1893. The PRR also proposed a tunnel from Brooklyn to Jersey City, approximately following the planned path of the Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, ten years later. The project was never started, despite efforts by government planners to start the project from the 1920s through the 1940s. In January 1935, New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia solicited the PANYNJ's help to create a report, called the \\"Summary of Cross Bays Freight Tunnel Study (Routes via Staten Island),\\" detailing four routes for a freight tunnel running to New Jersey via a tunnel to Staten Island. However, the only option that was deemed feasible was one that went from the end of the Bay Ridge Branch in Brooklyn to Greenville Yard in Greenville, New Jersey, which could either go through Staten Island or directly under the New York Bay. While the route via Staten Island, estimated at $35 million, could potentially accommodate a passenger line at a cost of another $28 million, other costs made the direct route cheaper. In 1978, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas studied four options for a tunnel from Brooklyn to New Jersey, some involving a tunnel to Staten Island. These included an option for a tunnel directly from Greenville Yard to the Bay Ridge Branch, and a link from New Jersey to Manhattan. Also under consideration was a single-tube tunnel with accommodations for electric units only. The Greenville‚ÄìBrooklyn tunnel would be about $331 million, which was cheaper than the approximately $405 million tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn.Cross Bay Tunnel Alternatives; Intermodal Study; Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade & Douglas; April 1978.  Boulevard Subway plan  In 1912, Wood, Harmon & Co proposed a new subway from Bayonne, New Jersey, to Staten Island. This was called the Boulevard Subway. In their advertisements, the company stated, \\"Five or ten years from now‚Äîwhen the subway to Staten Island is built‚Äî‚Ä¶ some Doubting Thomases of New Yorkers who don't buy will be shedding tears at their lack of foresight.\\" The plan resurfaced in 1929, when meetings took place between Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague and officials from New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker's office. This plan proposed a subway line running along the SIRT North Shore Branch and John F. Kennedy Boulevard in New Jersey, before connecting with the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (today's PATH train) at Exchange Place. The service would have provided access to Lower Manhattan via the H&M;'s Downtown Hudson Tubes to Hudson Terminal (now the site of the World Trade Center station). There were also plans to extend the line to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee.  Vehicular tunnels under the Narrows  In 1929, after the cancellation of the plan to build a subway tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn, engineers proposed a set of vehicular tunnels from Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, to 97th Street, Brooklyn. The tubes were being planned in conjunction with the Triborough Tunnel (the modern-day Queens Midtown Tunnel), which would connect Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. The city appropriated $5 million for the tunnels in July 1929. Boring work for the vehicular tunnels started in November 1930, but in January 1932, construction was delayed indefinitely due to a lack of money. The construction work did not go beyond an examination of shoreline on the Brooklyn side. In 1936, the plan for a vehicular tunnel under the Narrows was brought up again when Mayor La Guardia gained authorization to petition Congress for a bridge across the strait. LaGuardia preferred a tunnel instead, and so the next year he requested the New York City Tunnel Authority to review the feasibility of such a crossing. In 1943, the New York City Board of Estimate allocated $50,000 toward a feasibility study of the tubes. After World War II ended in 1945, the New York City Planning Commission estimated that construction of the Narrows Tunnel would cost $73.5 million. However, by then, La Guardia had turned against the tunnel, saying that \\"it is not my time\\" to construct the tunnel. This prompted Robert Moses to propose the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which opened in 1964 and only carries vehicles.

It was developed in 1994 when the link to the A14 was added to the pre-existing M1/M6 junction by joining the M1, M6 and A14 to the country lane between Catthorpe and Swinford as part of the Trans European Road Network,. The interchange currently handles over 157,000 vehicles per day and as the previous layout was overloaded and had a poor safety record, improvements were required. Traffic attempting to avoid the interchange caused congestion and nuisance in nearby towns and villages. The Highways Agency acknowledged that the layout of the interchange resulted in a serious accident problem, inconvenience for those wishing to travel between villages in the area, and delays and congestion for both motorway and non- motorway traffic. In January 2014, the work on upgrading the junction to a new free-flowing layout began. The final phase, the local link road, was opened to traffic on 22 December 2016. History 1940s map showing alignment of A427 overlaid with current roads The interchange was created in 1994 to join the newly established A14 trunk road with the existing M1 and M6 motorways. A non- standard layout was adopted and a sub-standard dumb-bell roundabout was created to handle the A14 traffic, and which became grossly inadequate before 2010. Prior to the junction with the A14 being created, there was a simple fork junction, opened in 1971, joining the M6 to the M1. At that stage traffic from Birmingham on the M6 wishing to travel north and east left the M6 at junction 1 to join the A426 road. The interchange had been grossly overloaded. In the five years prior to March 2010, more than twelve people were killed and many more seriously injured in crashes at the interchange. M1 Jct 19 Improvement Scheme By 1998 the government recognised that the intersection was a bottle-neck in the strategic highway network and suffering serious safety and congestion problems. In March 2005 the contract for the planning, design, management and construction of the scheme through the Statutory Procedures from preparation of draft Orders to completion of construction was awarded to Skanska/Jacobs Babtie and the Highways Agency started working with Skanska to prepare the plans for a Public Inquiry. Public consultations were held in July 2008 and a preferred route was selected in 2009. In June 2010, as part of the government's budget cuts, the project was delayed until after 2015. This resulted in the planned public inquiry being postponed until closer to the construction date. On 13 December 2011 roads minister Mike Penning announced that ¬£150 million had been made available for junction improvements. Highways England states that the cost is ¬£191m. The inspectors report gives the cost as between ¬£217m and ¬£280m with a 'most likely cost' of ¬£251m. The preferred option was for a three level junction that would separate motorway/trunk road traffic from local traffic completely and provided limited interchange opportunities for through traffic: *M1 southbound to A14 eastbound - but not to M6 northbound *M1 northbound to M6 westbound - but not to A14 *M6 southbound to M1 southbound and A14 eastbound - but not to M1 northbound *A14 westbound to M1 northbound and M6 northbound - but not to M1 southbound Full construction began on 6 January 2014 and the scheme was fully opened to traffic in December 2016.

Furthermore, the honorary president of the congress became Prof. Pier Ugo Calzolari who is the former Rector of Bologna University and the Vice President of International Association of Universities (IAU). During the congress, an attempt was made to establish the changes which need to be made by politicians, businessmen, NGOs, students, and universities in order to properly deal with the new global agenda. The most important emphasis of the congress was that ‚Äúuniversities must adapt the innovations by undertaking new missions.‚Äù Many countries and universities from all over the world - 250 universities and many rectors, academicians, politicians and the representatives of non-governmental organizations from 50 countries including mainly Australia with its 10 universities‚Äô representatives, Germany with its many universities and European Countries, the USA, Balkan Countries, African and Asian countries attended the congress. 400 papers were published in the congress proceedings. Roughly 500 speakers including panelists, session speakers, keynote speakers and the ones who presented their papers have contributed to the congress. During the congress 400 invited guests were hosted by Onsekiz Mart University and approximately 1000 domestic and foreign participants accommodated in the hotels in √áanakkale. The preparations for the congress have been lasted 4 years and all the institutions and corporations in √áanakkale have highly supported the congress. The main idea asserted in all congress papers is to emphasize the importance of getting an important and meaningful position in business, social and political life or in NGOs depends on possessing a university degree from a university providing a highly qualified education. However, it was discussed that merely dispensing degrees is not enough and the roles and missions of universities need to be expanded and redefined. Today, universities cannot carry out their functions by isolating themselves from social and humanitarian issues and crises. Instead, in addition to their three common functions (training-educating, research, public service) they should also adopt as their missions the prevention and solution of global terrorism, global warming, natural disasters, crises, global starvation, inequity in income distribution, inadequate health and education services, regional conflicts and disasters due to global migration. The statistics on global terrorism and high armaments expenditure, global starvation, regional conflicts, expenditures made to achieve peace, unequal distribution of income, inadequate health and education services, global migration, global unemployment, environmental pollution, global warming and poverty require the intervention of universities both qualitatively and quantitatively. With the aim of seeking answers to the question ‚ÄúWhat can world universities do in order to prevent the global problems? ‚Äù, the following themes have been discussed during the congress. * Redefining the concept of ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù under new conditions: the concept of university yesterday, today and in the future * Understanding and preventing global climate change * Preventing global terrorism * Eradicating global poverty * Solving the problems of global migration * Eradicating inequalities in income distribution * Eradicating injustice in health care services * Eradicating inequality in educational opportunities * Proposing solutions for environmental pollution * Preventing regional conflicts and the outbreak of new conflicts * Securing world peace * Protecting cultural heritage * Developing permanent solutions for fast population growth * Expanding the role of non-governmental organizations in local and international developments. Following the closing panel of WUC, a global organization of √áanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, a declaration released to the World with the participations of many scholars who are expert is their fields in accordance with the outputs of the congress. During the closing panel which was carried out in the presidency of vice-president of International Association of Universities Prof. Pier Ugo Calzolari, distinguished scholars made speeches respectively; Prof. Dr. Ali Akdemir, √áanakkale Onsekiz Mart University Rector; Prof. Ute Stoltenberg, Leuphana University Lueneburg; Prof. Dr. Enver Duran, Rector of Trakya University; Prof. Dr. Hilmi Ibar, Dean of Education Faculty of Trakya University, Dr. Garik Gutman, NASA; Assoc. Dr. John Hall, Deakin University; Prof. Dr. Mahir Nakip, Deputy Rector of Ahmet Yesevi University; Prof. Dr. Herald Hauptmann, Heidelberg University; Prof. Dr. Bernd Martin, Rector of Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University Loerrach and Prof. Dr. Jack Hawkins, Rector of Troy University. The findings of the congress indicated that the main tasks of universities cannot be restricted only to training- education, research and public service subjects. As the global problems mentioned above are continually increasing and becoming more acute, universities cannot isolate themselves from these issues. They must become more involved and assume different roles to try and respond to some of the issues facing society. They can be active participants in many processes, take on new roles, such as peacemaker, mediator, entrepreneur, initiator, interactive participant, and the like. They can make recommendations to authorities and administrators, for example, that a reduction in the funds allocated to armaments must be transferred to university research projects in order to provide everybody with a more peaceful world. It will only then be possible to create an environment without hunger, poverty, conflicts and war. In this context, universities should reconstruct their institutions to offer solutions to global and chronic problems. Higher education now constitutes an international sector and universities must seize the opportunities presented to them, cooperate and interact with NGOs and other institutions, and train professionals, employees, administrators and leaders who can function and respond to the needs of a changing world. The new generation of university administrators must emerge from their universities; rectors must become entrepreneurs and generate resources for high quality research and service to the community both locally and globally.

Ball, MIT to House New Dibner Institute, MIT Tech Talk, September 23, 1992Alex Roland (April 2006), David Dibner, 1927‚Äì2005, Technology and Culture, 47(2) 472‚Äì475 Description At the heart of the Institute was the Burndy Library on the ground floor, initially containing 37,000 volumes on the history of science and technology collected by the Dibner Fund. The Library also possessed a large collection of antique scientific instruments, such as astrolabes, telescopes, microscopes, early spectrometers, and a Wimshurst machine, which were on public display in a dedicated gallery outside the library. Also on display was a large collection of antique incandescent light bulbs, gas discharge tubes, electronic vacuum tubes, and other early examples of electrical and electronic technology. The Library would mount occasional special exhibits, such as The Afterlife of Immortality: Obelisks Outside Egypt. Above the Library and display space, on the second and third floor were offices and lecture and seminar rooms. The Institute held regular lectures, seminars, study programs, and an annual symposium in the history of science and technology. Over the period of its existence, the Institute supported over 340 short- and longer-term fellowships.  History and development  The Institute was named in honor of Bern Dibner (1897‚Äì1988), who had conceived of it before his death. The Institute was developed and supported by the Dibner Fund he had established in 1957, directed by his son David Dibner. The institute, from its inception, was run by executive director Evelyn Simha. On the academic side, the Institute was supported by a consortium of MIT, Boston University, Brandeis University and Harvard University. In 1995, the 600-volume Babson Collection of historical material related to Isaac Newton was placed on permanent deposit with the Burndy Library. The collection had been assembled by Roger Babson, founder of Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and was previously housed at the College. In 1999, the addition of the 7,000-volume Volterra Collection from Italy increased the Burndy Library collection by more than a third. In 2004 MIT decided not to renew its affiliation, and the Dibner family began looking for a new location to house the collection. David Dibner died unexpectedly in 2005. The Dibner Institute closed in 2006, and the Burndy Library and associated collections were transferred to The Huntington Library in San Marino, California, which now offers a Dibner History of Science Program to fund fellowships, a lecture series and annual conference. The acquisition of the Burndy Library (by then numbering 67,000 volumes) transformed the Huntington Library's collections in the history of science and technology into one of the world's largest in that field. The Huntington houses a permanent exhibition, Beautiful Science: Ideas that Changed the World, in the Dibner Hall of the History of Science that displays approximately 150 books, manuscripts, photographs and objects from both the Burndy Library and the Huntington's non-Burndy holdings in the history of science and medicine. Approximately 200 antique light bulbs from the Burndy Collection are on display in the Beautiful Science exhibition. The light bulbs are not available for reference or research use, except by special arrangement. The status and accessibility of the Burndy collection of gas tubes, vacuum tubes, and electronic artifacts is not clear from the Huntington website. The Dibner Institute's former building was demolished in early 2007 to make way for new buildings for the MIT Sloan School of Management.New home for Dibner trees, MIT Tech Talk, December 20, 2006 The Dibner name remains at MIT, in the endowed Frances and David Dibner Professorship of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing.

He previously played for the Gold Coast Football Club from 2011 to 2013, and the Geelong Football Club from 2013 to 2016. Caddy was drafted by Gold Coast with the seventh selection in the 2010 AFL draft after captaining underage football with the Northern Knights in the TAC Cup. He was a premiership player with Richmond in both 2017 and 2019. Junior football Caddy played junior football with Eltham in the Diamond Valley Football League before joining the Northern Knights in the TAC Cup. He played a handful of matches for the Knights in 2009 and went to be captain the club in 13 matches in the 2010 season. He placed second in the club's best and fairest that year. During this time he formed a friendship with Knights teammate and eventual and teammate, Dion Prestia. In 2010 Caddy represented the Victorian Metropolitan side at the AFL Under 18 Championships after having previously done the same at under 16 level. He played three matches for the tournament, recording averages of 23.7 disposals and 3.3 marks per game. He was awarded All- Australian selection for his stellar performances. AFL career=Gold Coast (2011-2012)2011 season= Caddy was drafted by the Gold Coast Suns with the club's fourth selection and the seventh selection overall in the 2010 AFL draft. He suffered a navicular bone injury early in the year, and was held back from football duties until late into the club's inaugural season. Caddy made his AFL debut in Round 23 that year, in a losing match against at the MCG. He had 10 disposals, five marks and three tackles in the match. He kicked his first career goal the next week, in his second career match and the Suns' last game of the season. At the conclusion of the season, it was revealed that Caddy was seeking a trade to a Victorian-based club in order to be closer to his father, who was suffering a heart condition. He was linked to in October, after reports emerged that the club had offered Gold Coast a first round draft selection and two contracted players (Josh Jenkins and one of Scott Gumbleton or Cale Hooker) in exchange for Caddy's services. Despite AFL- led mediation conducted to help the clubs negotiate, no deal was ultimately struck, and Caddy remained at the Gold Coast after the annual trade period concluded. =2012 season= Caddy with Gold Coast in May 2012 2012 was a much better season for Caddy, playing in all 22 of the club's matches that year. In the club's Round 15 loss to , he recorded 18 disposals and a team high three goals in the 14 point loss. Despite his personal success, the poor form of the Suns meant Caddy did not play in his first AFL victory until his 17th career match, in Round 16 of the 2012 season. In this match, Caddy won the weekly nomination for the 2012 AFL Rising Star award. He finished the season ranked third at the club for total disposals (334), fourth for goals (15) and fifth for clearances (44). In September 2012, the Gold Coast Suns announced that Caddy was again requesting a trade to a Victorian based club.

Caddy faced a restricted pre-season in 2013, with ongoing recovery necessary for shoulder surgery that he underwent in September 2012. Despite this, he was selected to make his Cats debut in the club's round 1 match against . He played in just six of the club's first 12 AFL matches that season, before playing 11 straight including a losing qualifying final against . Though he did not play in the club's semi- final match, he returned to the club's losing preliminary final team against eventual premiers Hawthorn. He finished the season having played 18 matches and kicking a total of 11 goals. =2014 season= Following an impressive close to 2013, Caddy won immediate selection into Geelong's AFL side for round 1, 2014. Despite receiving an accidental kick to the face by teammate and captain Joel Selwood (and seven stitches as a result), Caddy recorded an impressive 20 disposals and a goal in the match. He was named in Geelong's best players by AFL Media's report of the match. After four consecutive matches at the top level, Caddy sustained a foot injury while training in late April. Scans later revealed a serious break that would require eight weeks on the sidelines. He returned to the side for a round 14 match-up with Gold Coast. Caddy notched his 50th career game in round 17 that season. He recorded a career best 12 tackles in the match. Caddy played in all of the club's last 12 matches of the season including losing finals to Hawthorn and . Caddy had a team high 26 disposals in the losing semi-final to North Melbourne. He finished the season having played 16 matches and kicking 11 goals. =2015 season= Caddy started the season in Geelong's best-22 for the third straight season when he lined up against in round 1, 2015. He was named in the Cats' best by AFL Media the following week, with a 20 disposal and 10 tackle effort against in round 2. The Australian Associated Press labelled Caddy's 20 disposal, two goal, round 10 performance as a continuation of \\"his emergence as a goal-kicking midfielder of real class.\\" He was labelled by 3AW's Matthew Lloyd as the Cats' second-best performer in the following weeks victory over . Despite an apparently strong season to that point, Caddy was ranked seventh in the league for fewest disposals per turnover (4.2) at the end of round 11. In round 16, Caddy set career highs in disposals (37) and clearances (12) in the Cats' victory over the at Kardinia Park. In the latter part of the season Caddy endured symptoms of knee tendinitis and was subbed out early in the club's round 21 match against as a result. He did not play another game that season, and finished the year with 19 games played, a then-career-best 16 goals and seventh place in the club's best-and-fairest tally. =2016 season= With the addition of Patrick Dangerfield in the previous years' off-season, Caddy was in line to play more time in the forward 50 for Geelong in 2016. He started the season strongly, kicking three goals and recording 21 disposals and seven clearances in the club's round 1 win over Hawthorn. Caddy suffered a medial ligament strain in Geelong's round 13 match with the Western Bulldogs. He had played in each of the club's matches to that point, but was forced to sit-out nearly two months of senior football as a result of the injury. He returned to the side in round 20, kicking 2 goals and gathering 19 disposals in the process. Caddy played in his first career finals win in September 2016, in a qualifying final against Hawthorn. He finished the season having played 18 matches and kicking a career best 21 goals. He was eighth at the club for disposals per game, seventh for total tackles and sixth for goals scored in season 2016. Caddy was one of just ten players in the competition to record averages of 20 or more disposals and one goal per game on a minimum of five games played that season. When 's Brett Deledio began seeking a trade to Geelong in October 2016, Caddy's name was circulated in media reports concerning the potential deal. It was later revealed that Caddy's older brother Saul had run into former teammate and current Richmond CEO Brendon Gale in a chance encounter a month earlier and let slip of his younger brother's unrest at Geelong. Richmond reportedly offered Caddy increased midfield playing time as an incentive to move clubs. On 19 October, the day he himself had been traded to Richmond, former teammate Dion Prestia told journalists he had been in contact with Caddy in an attempt to lure him to the club. Though a deal involving Deledio eventually fell through, Richmond persisted in its pursuit of Caddy until late into the trade period. Richmond (2017-present)2017 season= Caddy in the 2017 AFL Grand Final parade Caddy was traded to on the final day of the trade period, in exchange for a second round draft pick and a swap of later picks. He made his Richmond debut in the opening match of the 2017 season, a victory against at the MCG. He recorded 17 disposals and a goal in the round 1 match. Caddy played his 100th career match in round 5's Anzac Day eve match against . He had 21 disposals and 5 tackles in the match and kicked the match sealing goal late in the fourth quarter of Richmond's win. For the first time that season he was named among the club's best players for the match. Prior to round 7 coach Damien Hardwick admitted to having played Caddy away from the ball too regularly, committing him to more midfield time in coming weeks. He did well in the role that week, notching 20 disposals, three clearances, four tackles and a goal. After pulling up sore from a training session Caddy was a late withdrawal from Richmond's round 9 match against the GWS Giants. When full- forward teammate Jack Riewoldt sustained an eye injury, Caddy was called on to play as the team's focal point up forward. He kicked a goal in the first of these matches, before adding four more in the role against in round 20. It was a season best performance for him, adding 28 disposals, nine marks and even missing a further four shots on goal. He would not get a chance to repeat that performance though, suffering a hamstring strain early in the first quarter of the next week's match up against his old side Geelong. He missed two games as a result, making his return with two goals in Richmond's winning qualifying final against Geelong. From there Caddy and Richmond progressed to a preliminary final match-up with GWS, before a win saw them into a Grand Final against minor premiers . Caddy became a premiership player following that match, kicking Richmond's first goal in his side's 48 point victory. =2018 season= Caddy in August 2018 After featuring in each of Richmond's two pre- season matches as a forward with limited minutes in the midfield, Caddy began the 2018 season with three goals in round 1's season-opening win over . He repeated the total the following week, but was also issued a one-match suspension for striking Adelaide's David Mackay in the face with a stray fist in a marking contest during the fourth quarter of that round 2 loss. He made an immediate return to football in round 4, but was limited to just one game with hamstring soreness seeing him miss again in round 5. Upon his return in round 6, Caddy kicked a then-equal career best four goals in a win over and was named in AFL Media's team of the week. He equaled that output in round 8 and went past it again with six goals in round 10. Along with his goal tally, Caddy added 24 disposals and a game high seven tackles to earn the Ian Stewart Medal as best on ground in that win over . At the half-way point of the season Caddy was named in Fox Footy's mid-year All Australian squad and was named in the Herald Sun and AFL Media teams of 22 players. To that point he ranked the number one most improved player in the league according to Champion Data's official player ratings. He was also placed fourth in the league's goalkicking race with a total of 27 kicked over his nine matches, despite playing an analysed 61 per cent to 39 per cent split of forward and midfield minutes. Caddy was held goalless in round 12's loss to , the first such occasion since beginning a 17 game goalscoring streak in round 18 the previous season. After kicking a total of eight goals across the next seven matches, Caddy returned to the major goalkickers list with four more in a win over in round 21. He repeated that tally in round 22, leading 1116 SEN commentator Gary Lyon to call for his inclusion in that year's All-Australian team. Caddy finished the home and away season having kicked a career-best 44 goals, earning him 10th place in the Coleman Medal race for the league's leading goalkicker. For that, he was named in the preliminary squad of 40 players though ultimately went unselected in the final 2018 All-Australian team. He was however, named in the forwardline of the AFL's Player Ratings seconds team for 2018. After finishing the season as minor premiers, Caddy's side earned a home qualifying final against where he kicked two goals in the win. He did however, attract two separate fines from the AFL's Match Review Officer for physical altercations and additionally issued a public apology for verbally abusing two of his opponents with derogatory ablest comments which were picked up on umpires' microphones and included in the television broadcast coverage of that match. In the ensuing preliminary final, Caddy was held goalless and with an equal season-low 11 disposals when Richmond was eliminated with a shock loss to rivals . Caddy finished 2018 having played 22 matches and kicked 46 goals, earning 10th place in the Richmond club best and fairest award. =2019 season= Caddy underwent minor ankle surgery in the early weeks of the 2018/19 off-season, but started pre-season training on schedule in November. During that period he was listed by the AFL's official statistical partner Champion Data as the 88th best player in the league. In February he picked up some ankle soreness while training which was expected to see him miss two to three weeks of training. That timeline was extended such that he missed both of the club's two pre-season matches in early and mid March. Caddy made his return to football in the VFL in April, during the weekend of the AFL's round 3. He was recalled to senior level the next week, where he contributed three goals in a win over while playing as an inside midfielder and a forward in the absence of Dustin Martin. The off-season acquisition of goalkicking tall forward Tom Lynch forced Caddy down the pecking order in the Richmond forward line, but despise long stretches in the midfield he remained a key goalkicker in the early part of the season while fellow forward Jack Riewoldt was out injured. He kicked another two goals in round 5 before being named among Richmond's best players with 25 disposals and a goal in round 8's win over . Caddy kicked three goals as a forward the following week against . In round 15 Caddy played his 150th AFL match, kicking one goal in the post-bye win over . He was left out of the side the following week due to an apparent leg injury but was forced to make a return to football through the VFL a week later. Though Caddy impressed as an inside midfielder with two goals and 26 disposals in that match, he remained at the lower level for a further week in or order to trial a new role as a defensive wing. A minor ankle injury sustained at training in the days following that match would further delay his return to senior football, though Caddy would eventually be recalled for round 20's match against after just one week on the injury list and without playing another reserves-grade match. Caddy held his spot at senior level over the final four weeks of the season, producing modest results in the role of defensive wing which he had trialed for one week at VFL level. He kicked two goals in that position in the opening round of the finals, as Richmond had a 47-point qualifying final victory over the . A fortnight later Caddy's output was quieter, producing an important five intercept possessions but also recording four turnovers from just 13 disposals in his side's preliminary final victory over . AFL Media said Caddy \\"did a little bit of everything\\" in the grand final, collecting 19 disposals and applying a game-high 25 pressure acts along with six tackles as his side defeated by 89 points and earned Caddy a second premiership in three years. At year's end Caddy had played 18 matches and placed 20th in the club's best and fairest count. =2020 season= After a full and uninterrupted training program in the 2019/20 off-season, Caddy resumed his role on the wing with fine performances in the pre-season series including being named by AFL Media as among the club's best players in the first of those two matches. He signed a new contract extension before the season proper began, committing to the club until the end of the 2022 season. Caddy contributed 15 disposals to a round 1 win over Carlton when the season began, but under extraordinary conditions imposed on the league as a result of the rapid progression of the coronavirus pandemic into Australia. In what the league planned would be the first of a reduced 17-round season, the match was played without crowds in attendance due to public health prohibitions on large gatherings and with quarter lengths reduced by one fifth in order to reduce the physical load on players who would be expected to play multiple matches with short breaks in the second half of the year. Just three days later, the AFL Commission suspended the season after multiple states enforced quarantine conditions on their borders that effectively ruled out the possibility of continuing the season as planned. After an 11-week hiatus, the season resumed without Caddy able to play, owing to a calf strain sustained while training in the days prior to Richmond's round 2 match. He required just one week of rest however, returning with 13 disposals in a round 3 loss to . Caddy struggled for form early in the season restart, attracting criticisms about his suitability to a wing role from media personalities Terry Wallace and Matthew Lloyd. He suffered a minor gluteus strain mid-match against in round 5 but was able to play through it, before suffering a significant torn hamstring during round 7's win over . Though club officials projected the injury would take three to four weeks to heal, Caddy beat expectations and returned to fitness in time to make a return for the club's round 11 match against . He could not hold his spot however, dropped back to reserves level following a poor performance that included giving up a 50-metre penalty that resulted in an opposition goal. In place of the by-then cancelled VFL season, Caddy played in unofficial scratch matches against other clubs' reserves players in mid- August, before resurgent hamstring troubles ruled him out from match play at either level through early-September. Player profile Caddy is capable of playing in multiple positions including as a goal-scoring half-forward, a ball-winning inside midfielder and as a defensive wing.

It has three or four egg-shaped leaves and up to thirty small, dull reddish flowers crowded along a thin, hairy flowering stem. It was first recorded in 1904 but was not seen again until 2009. Description Zeuxine exilis is a terrestrial, tuberous, perennial herb with three or four light green, lance-shaped leaves, long and wide. Between ten and thirty resupinate, dull reddish flowers with white petals, about long and wide are crowded on a thin, hairy flowering stem tall. The outside surface of the flowers is hairy. The dorsal sepal is about long, wide and overlaps the petals forming a hood over the column. The lateral sepals and petals are about long and wide with the lateral sepals spreading apart from each other. The labellum is white with a yellow centre, about long, wide with two lobes on the end that have wavy edges. Flowering occurs from July to September. Txonomy and naming Zeuxine exilis was first formally described in 1906 by Dr Henry Ridley and the description was published in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. The specific epithet (exilis) is a Latin word meaning \\"thin\\" or \\"slender\\". History of rediscovery The rugged terrain on Christmas Island deterred early naturalists from surveying much of island. Charles William Andrews, a British palaeontologist spent ten months on the island in 1897 and 1898 and although he collected several orchids, did not find Z. exilis. In October 1904, Henry Ridley, the first director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens made his second, longer visit and crossed the island, including the upper plateau where he collected the orchid he later named Z. exilis, on the 18th of that month. He noted \\"centre of the island, among ferns not rare.\\" The species was then not officially recorded for over a century and in the third Christmas Island National Park Management Plan (2002) it was considered \\"possibly extinct\\". Other botanists, including Dulcie Alicia Powell and David J. Du Puy made collections on the island in the 1980s and 1990s without locating Z. exilis. Then in 2009 it was found and collected by visiting research scientist Peter Green and the discovery was confirmed by Mark Clements. Distribution and habitat Ridley's jewel orchid is endemic to Christmas Island where it grows in litter on the floor of rainforest.

She developed the GAL4/UAS system with Norbert Perrimon which has been described as ‚Äúa fly geneticist's Swiss army knife‚Äù. Early life and education Brand was born in the U.S., where her father was an economist at the United Nations in New York. She graduated from the UN International School in New York and in 1977, inspired by the work of Rosalind Franklin, she moved to Britain to study biochemistry at the University of Oxford. She studied at Oxford from 1977 to 1981, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honors. From there she went to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge. She was there from 1981 to 1986, in which year she was awarded a Ph.D. Career and research=Postdoctoral work She then engaged in postdoctoral research work on yeast transcription at Harvard University, where from 1986 to 1988 she was a Helen Hay Whitney Fellow in the Department of Biochemistry, associated with the laboratory of Dr. Mark Ptashne. Having decided to switch from biochemistry to neurobiology, Brand moved in the late 1980s to Norbert Perrimon's laboratory in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, where from 1988 to 1993 she was a Leukemia Society Special Fellow. It was there that Brand conceived of the GAL4 system, which Lancet has described as ‚Äúan ingenious toolkit that allows researchers to turn on genes in any cell type and at any time of development, and thus engineer and test the function of both genes and proteins. The effect of this system on fly genetics is hard to exaggerate‚Äîone scientist has described it as 'a fly geneticist's Swiss army knife'. By causing cells to express cell death genes‚Äîand effectively commit suicide‚Äîthe system can model diabetes by killing insulin-producing cells. 'It has also been used to express mutant versions of proteins to model neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's', says Brand. Now the most highly cited paper in the Drosophila field, Brand had enormous difficulty in getting the paper published.‚Äù Lancet notes that the GAL4 system remains ‚Äúat the heart of Brand's current work on Drosophila neural stem cells. Because of the similarities between Drosophila and mammalian neural stem cells in their ability to self-renew and differentiate into different types of neurons and glial cells, the work has the potential to help develop therapies for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's.‚Äù Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute From 1993 to 2003, Brand was a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellow in Basic Biomedical Research at Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute. From 2003 to 2007, she was Director of Research in Developmental Neurobiology at the same institution. Since 2005 she has been Senior Group Leader there, and since 2007 she has been the Herchel Smith Professor of Molecular Biology both at that institution and at the Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge. During these years Brand has performed work on nervous-system development that the Royal Society has described as ‚Äúpioneering.‚Äù According to the Royal Society, her study of the fruit fly's embryonic nervous system ‚Äúhas led to new insights into the biology of neural stem cells, and the ability of neurons to regenerate after damage.‚Äù Moreover, Brand ‚Äúidentified a novel role for a key regulator in cell division in controlling the strength of neuronal connections,‚Äù which ‚Äúcould help uncover new drug targets in the search for treatments for neural disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease.‚Äù As one source explains, ‚ÄúBrand is looking for stem cells in adult fruit flies' brains and trying to understand how genes are regulated throughout life. The aim of the work is to learn how to control cells to produce the right neuron at the right place at the right time. One protein, known by the name Prospero, is responsible for regulating stem cells to produce cells which produce neurons. Without the Prospero protein, tumours result. Brand has provided this ‚Äúplain English‚Äù explanation of her work: ‚ÄúOne of the goals of research in neurobiology is to repair or regenerate neurons after damage to the brain or spinal cord. Before we can understand how to repair the nervous system, however, we must first learn how the nervous system is put together. Of all the tissues and organs in the human body the nervous system is the most intricate and complex, consisting of more than one trillion neurons. These neurons make precise connections with each other to form functional networks that can transmit information at amazing speed over considerable distances. ‚ÄúNeurons are produced by multipotent precursors called stem cells. Neural stem cells divide in a self-renewing manner, generating daughter cells that give rise to different types of neurons. The aim of our work is to identify the genes that direct the different behaviours of cells in the developing nervous system. When we identify the genes that specify the characteristic behaviours of each of the different cell types in the nervous system, it may become possible to manipulate them in such a way as to induce stem cells to become neurons at will, or induce neurons to regenerate.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn earlier work,‚Äù the Royal Society has noted, ‚ÄúDr Brand characterised the first transcriptional silencer and originated the GAL4 system for targeted gene expression during development. The GAL4 system has been adapted for use in many other model organisms; it has had a major influence on developmental biology.‚Äù This system has been described as ‚Äúa fly geneticist's Swiss army knife‚Äù.[5] Brand, both alone and in collaboration with her coworkers, has published papers in such scientific journals as Public Health Genomics, Developmental Biology, Cell, Journal of Reproductive Immunology, Development, Journal of Biological Chemistry, Clinical Genetics, Neural Development, Journal of Neuroscience, Journal of Cell Science, and Blood.

History  For years, financial services companies have been required to quote an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) in any credit terms or advertisements. Up until 2010, all businesses had to comply with the Consumer Credit (Advertisement) Regulations 2004 (2004 Regulations).Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, \\"Regulations Implementing The Consumer Credit Directive: Quick Start Guide\\", Aug 2010, page 3 However, all European Union member states adopted a new Directive in April 2008. This has been implemented in the UK by the Consumer Credit (EU Directive) Regulations 2010, which came into force for all UK companies on 1 February 2011. While the Directive is similar to the existing policies adopted in the UK, there are a couple of major changes. One of the most important of these is introduction of a ‚ÄòRepresentative APR‚Äô.  What the new rules say  The Department for Business, Skills and Innovation (BSI) is clear on what the new Directive means for financial services providers and consumers in the UK. The BSI states: ‚ÄúIf an advertisement includes an interest rate or any amount relating to the cost of credit, it must also include a representative example.CompareAndSave.com, Emma Skinner (Ed.): 'What is a Representative Example?' Published 2010-11-17, Retrieved 2011-11-18 This must contain certain standard information including a representative APR. The example must be clear and concise and must be more prominent than the information that triggered the inclusion of the example.‚ÄùDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills, \\"Regulations Implementing The Consumer Credit Directive: Quick Start Guide\\", (2010), page 5  Products the new rules apply to  The new Directive applies to advertisements and credit agreements for all loans to consumers under ¬£60,260 excluding:Bond Pearce \\" Consumer Credit Directive sets advertising regulations\\" Published on 2010-06-09, Retrieved 2010-11-18 * agreements secured on land * business loans (certified) * investments regulated by the FSA  Definition of ‚Äòrepresentative APR‚Äô  The APR for financial services products often varies from customer to customer. This is particularly true if loan or credit card rates are determined by an individual's income or credit rating. In addition, the problem with the current way of working out an APR is that it often doesn't take into account certain fees, such as credit card balance transfer fees or annual charges. So, in instances where the APR for a financial product can vary, the APR that is stated on an advertisement must represent the business that the financial services provider expects to come from that advert. A representative APR will also take into account other charges associated with the product (in addition to the interest rate) and will be displayed within the Representative Example. A company works out its ‚Äòtypical‚Äô APR by taking into account past business that has arisen from advertising similar products, ideally over the previous 12 months. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) suggests to companies that they ‚Äúlist the APRs your customers have paid over the past 12 months. The representative APR you state in your advert should not be less than the APR paid by at least 66% of consumers on the list.‚ÄùFinancial Services Authority: \\"Mortgages and Home Finance Advertising\\" - Retrieved 2010-11-18 However, from 1 February 2011, this calculation changed. The BSI reports that: ‚ÄúThe Representative APR must reflect at least 51% of business expected to result from the advertisement. The standard information must be representative of agreements to which the Representative APR applies.‚Äù A representative APR will be based on a credit limit of ¬£1,200 (unless known to be lower).  Additional services and security  Another subtle but important change to the rules now make it essential for financial services providers to display, in prominent text, whether there are any obligations on a consumer to enter into another contract (for example, if you have to take compulsory insurance products with a mortgage loan). In this situation, the cost must be shown with: * no less prominence than standard information * the representative APR The nature of any security must also be specified.

Protein scientist √Årp√°d Pusztai went public with the initial results of unpublished research he was conducting at the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, investigating the possible effects of genetically modified potatoes upon rats. Pusztai claimed that the genetically modified potatoes had stunted growth and repressed the rats' immune systems while thickening their gut mucosa. Initially supported by the Rowett Institute, his comments on a British television programme caused a storm of controversy, and the Rowett Institute withdrew its support. Pusztai was suspended and misconduct procedures were used to seize his data and ban him from speaking publicly. The institute did not renew his annual contract and Pusztai was criticized by the British Royal Society and some other scientists for making an announcement before his experiment was complete or peer-reviewed and for the experiment's design, methodology and analysis. Some of the data from the study was eventually published in The Lancet in 1999 after five out of six peer reviewers approved of the study ‚Äì triggering further controversy. Background Before 1995, no peer-reviewed studies had been published investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a ¬£1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemistProfessor J.A. Gatehouse ‚Äì Durham University John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin has been shown to be toxic to some insects. Twenty-eight studies were proposed, of which eight were selected for peer review by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. From these eight the Rowett Research Institute's proposal was chosen and a combined team of academics from the Scottish Crop Research Institute, the Durham University Department of Biology and the Rowett Institute was assembled, and coordinated by Pusztai. Although the tested potatoes were not a commercial variety and not intended for human consumptionArpad Pusztai: Biological divide James Randerson The Guardian January 15, 2008 a contract was signed with Cambridge Agricultural Genetics, which included a profit-sharing agreement, if potatoes developed using this technology were approved and released commercially.Arpad Pusztai GM Food Safety: Scientific and Institutional Issues Science as Culture, Volume 11 Number 1 March 2002 In earlier ten-day feeding trials on GNA-fed rats, Pusztai concluded that they did not significantly affect growth, despite some hypertrophy of the small intestine and a slight decrease of gut enzyme activity. Experiment The experimental potatoes had been transformed with the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats were fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified Desiree Red potatoes as controls. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop lectin. Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days). Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non- modified ones. The potatoes were chosen because they were deemed substantially equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes. The study used two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, as one of the transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines.Brian Tokar Redesigning life?: the worldwide challenge to genetic engineering Zed Books Pg 58 Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation. Their experiment showed a statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.Evidence of changes in the organs of rats fed genetically modified potatoes suggests minister's safety assurances may be premature The Guardian February 13, 1999 archived Berkeley University Announcement On June 22, 1998 Pusztai revealed his research findings during an interview on Granada Television's current affairs programme World in Action titled \\"Eat up your genes\\". Eat Up Your Genes (1998) He was given permission to do the interview by Rowett Institute Director Philip James. Rowett's press officer was present at the start of filming. During the interview Pusztai said he had \\"concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what we thought it was necessary to do, and therefore we should have more testing.\\" When asked why he felt concerned, he said \\"it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned\\" and discussed his results in general terms. Pusztai later said that at the time of the interview he was not sure if he should reveal results from experiments that had not been completed and did not think the programme would be hostile toward genetically modified food. He estimated that the experiments were 99 percent complete when the interview was conducted. He said that the rats in his experiments suffered stunted growth and had suppressed immune systems and that more safety research was required. He also said, \\"If you gave me the choice now, I wouldn't eat it\\" and it was \\"very, very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs\\".  Reaction  World in Action issued a press release the day before the broadcast, stimulating numerous phone calls to Pusztai and the Institute from government, industrial, non-governmental and media organisations. James says he was dismayed that unpublished data had been released and withdrew Pusztai from any further media commitments that morning. He eventually suspended Pusztai, used misconduct procedures to seize his data, banned him from speaking publicly and did not renew his annual contract. Confusion reigned over just what experiments had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned two lines of genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media was talking about a second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.  Audit  The Rowett Institute audited Pusztai's work on 22 October 1998. It concluded that his data did not support his conclusions. In February 1999, 22 scientists from 13 countries, organised by Friends of the Earth,Gaskell, George and Bauer, Martin W., editors, \\"Biotechnology, 1996‚Äì2000, the years of controversy\\", p. 295. The GM food debate, National Museum of Science and Industry, published a memo responding to the audit.Top researchers back suspended lab whistleblower The Guardian, 12 February 1999, Retrieved 12 November 2010 It stated that their independent examination supported Pusztai's conclusions and that he should have been concerned by his findings.  Royal Society peer review  On 19 February the Royal Society publicly announced that a committee would review his work. World in Action reporters Laurie Flynn and Michael Sean Gillard claimed that this was an unusual step, as the Royal Society did not normally conduct peer reviews. The data were sent to six anonymous reviewers and the resulting review was published in June 1999.Murray, Noreen et al., (1999) Review of data on possible toxicity of GM potatoes The Royal Society, 1 June 1999, Retrieved 28 November 2010 It stated that Pusztai's experiments were poorly designed, contained uncertainties in the composition of diets, tested too few rats, used incorrect statistical methods and lacked consistency within experiments. Pusztai responded by saying the reviewers had reviewed only internal Rowett reports, which did not include the design or methodology of the experiments.  Lancet response  The editors of The Lancet published an editorial in May 1999 in which they denounced all parties involved, criticizing Pusztai for \\"unwisely\\" announcing his results on television and stating that scientists should publish \\"results in the scientific press, not through the popular media\\"; the editorial also denounced the Royal Society's review as \\"breathtaking impertinence\\".Editors of the Lancet. Health risks of genetically modified foods The Lancet 353(9167):1811, May 29, 1999 Publication The data were published as a letter in The Lancet in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen. It reported significant differences in the thickness of the gut epithelium of rats fed genetically modified potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested. The letter was reviewed by six reviewers ‚Äì three times the Lancet's usual number. Four reviewers found it acceptable after revisions. A fifth thought it was flawed, but wanted it published \\"to avoid suspicions of a conspiracy against Pusztai and to give colleagues a chance to see the data for themselves\\". The sixth, John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research, also said it was flawed. After consulting with the Royal Society, Pickett publicly criticised The Lancet for agreeing to publish the study. The study, which used data held by Ewen, who was not subject to the veto of Pusztai's work, reported significant differences in thickness of the gut epithelium between control and test subjects, but did not mention growth or immunity problems. The published work was criticised on the grounds that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency. Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and energy content, and that the food intake of all rats was the same. In an interview, Pickett later said that Lancet editor Richard Horton must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review. Horton claimed that he had received a \\"very aggressive\\" phone call calling him \\"immoral\\" and threatening that if he published the paper it would \\"have implications for his personal position\\" as editor. Peter Lachmann, the former vice-president and biological secretary of the Royal Society and president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, acknowledged making the call but denies that he threatened Horton and says the call was to \\"discuss his error of judgment\\" in publishing the letter and to discuss the \\"moral difficulties about publishing bad science\\".Laurie Flynn and Michael Sean Gillard for The Guardian, October 31, 1999 Pro-GM scientist \\"threatened editor\\"  Aftermath  Ewen retired following publication, claiming that his career options had been \\"blocked at a very high level\\". A survey by the European Food Safety Authority GMO Panel Working Group on Animal Feeding Trials concluded: \\"Results obtained from testing GM food and feed in rodents indicate that large (at least 100-fold) 'safety' margins exist between animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects and estimated human daily intake. The studies did not show any biologically relevant differences in the parameters tested between control and test animals.\\" In 2005 Pusztai was given a whistleblower award from the Federation of German Scientists.

He scored a number of victories against the Umayyads, but was unable to halt the Arab conquest of Armenia, nor able to prevent the deposition of his brother by Justinian II (r. 685‚Äì695 and 705‚Äì711), who later captured and executed both Tiberius and Heraclius. Biography Nothing is known of his early life. The name of his brother, Apsimar, probably indicates a Germanic origin. In 698, Apsimar was proclaimed emperor by the Byzantine fleet after a failed expedition to recover Carthage. Apsimar set Constantinople under siege and succeeded in entering the city when some officers opened a gate. Deposing the emperor Leontius (r. 695‚Äì698), himself a usurper, Apsimar assumed the throne under the old Roman name Tiberius, and set about to gain legitimacy for his regime by securing a military victory against the Empire's major foe, the Umayyad Caliphate.. Heraclius was appointed by his brother as patrikios and commander-in-chief (monostrategos) of the Anatolian themes. In late autumn, he crossed with his army the mountain passes of the Taurus Mountains into Cilicia and thence headed to northern Syria. After defeating an Arab army from Antioch, he raided as far as Samosata before returning safely to the Empire in the spring of 699. This success only served to provoke a massive Arab response: over the next few years, the Caliphate's generals Muhammad ibn Marwan and Abdallah ibn Abd al-Malik launched a series of campaigns that conquered what remained of Byzantine Armenia, without Heraclius being able to respond effectively. In 702, however, the Armenians rose up in a large-scale revolt, and asked for Byzantine aid. In 704, while Abdallah, after securing his rear, launched another campaign to recover Armenia, Heraclius attacked the Arabs in Cilicia. He defeated an army of 10,000‚Äì12,000 under Yazid ibn Hunain at Sisium, killing most and leading the rest off in chains to Constantinople, but was unable to divert Abdallah from completing his reconquest of Armenia. At that time, the deposed emperor Justinian II () had escaped from his exile at Cherson and gained the aid of the khans of the Khazars and of the Bulgars. The Empire now faced another threat, as Justinian joined the Bulgar Khan Tervel in autumn 704 and prepared to march into Thrace. Heraclius was recalled from the East and sent to confront Justinian and Tervel, but the allied force bypassed Heraclius's army and seized Constantinople in late summer 705. Tiberius III managed to escape the capital to Sozopolis, where he joined the army of his brother. Their soldiers, however, began deserting them, and Tiberius and Heraclius were captured by Justinian's troops. After being paraded through Constantinople in chains, Heraclius and many of his senior- most officers were then hanged from the city walls, while Leontius and Tiberius were executed at some point between August 705 and February 706.

In the 20th century, Kazakh Soviet musicians experimented with chorus performance of Kuis. Kui in Kazakh culture performed with dombyra In Kazakh culture Kuis were learned by heart and passed from generation to generation without written fixation. For example Kazakh folk Kui ‚Äúaqsaq qulan‚Äù(lame onager) is dated to the 13th century. Authors of many famous Kazakh Kuis lived in Middle Ages. But the pick of the culture comes to the 19th and 20th centuries. Kui tradition included also verbal part that explained in detail the story for the Kui composition, personalities, reasons and legends of it. So before performing the Kui the performer used to give a story about the composition to play, so the auditory could get proper feelings from that. But by the time the verbal tradition for Kuis was finally separated from instrumental performances and only few Kuishi (performer of Kui) still keep this verbal part of Kazakh instrumental Kui tradition. Ancient composers of Kuis Dombyra Kuis were formed in the result of centuries-old folk instrumental performance tradition. There are many outstanding middle age musicians in Kazakh history: *Sypyra- Zhyrau (14th century) *Qaztugan or Abulqadir (15th century) *Asanqaigy (14th-15th centuries) *Baizhigit (15th-16th centuries) But the peak of the culture was achieved by the middle of 19th century. Then very many famous composers lived who created famous Kuis: *Qurmangazy Sagyrbai (1823‚Äì1889) *Mahambet Otemisuly (Utemisov, 1803‚Äì1846) *Dauletkerei Shygauly (Shygaev, 1821‚Äì1875 ) *Tattimbet Qazangapuly (Kazangapov, 1817‚Äì1862) *Abyl Taraquly, (Taraqov, 1820‚Äì1892) *Esbai (1810‚Äì1901) *Qazangap (1854‚Äì1921) *Toqa Shonmanuly (Shonmanov, 1830‚Äì1904) and others The famous composer woman Dina Nurpeisqyzy, or Dina Nurpisova (1861‚Äì1955) also began then her career. We can‚Äôt miss from the list Sugir Aliuly, or Sugur Aliev (1882‚Äì1961) and many others. Types of Kui There are folks Kuis and Kuis composed by Authors. It said that folks Kui may take their beginning from ritual worship acts of nomad tribes. Ever famous Kuishy (Performer of Kui) had his own unique techniques and features. The themes of Kuis are very fifferent: from philosophic thoughts to the wildness of nature. For example Dauletkerei‚Äôs Kui, ¬´Zhiger¬ª that means ‚Äúenergy to live‚Äù or Qazangap‚Äôs Kui ‚ÄúKokil‚Äù that means ‚Äúmelody of my soul‚Äù; Osen Tore‚Äôs Kui, ‚Äúottin dunie, kettin dunie‚Äù that means ‚Äúmy days have past‚Äù. Other Kuis represent detailed psychological portraits of individuals (Qurmangazy‚Äôs Kui ‚ÄúToremurat‚Äù-the name of a male person; Mamen‚Äôs Kui ‚ÄúAqsholpan‚Äù which is the name of a woman; Dina‚Äôs ‚ÄúAsem qonyr‚Äù). Other Kuis are about mother land-vast fields of Steppe: Qurmangazy‚Äôs Kui ¬´Sary Arqa¬ª that means ‚ÄúGolden Steppe‚Äù; Tattimbet‚Äôs Kui ‚ÄúSarzhailau‚Äù-Golden Plateau; Bogda‚Äôs Kui ‚ÄúZhem Suynyn tasqyny‚Äù means ‚Äúflood of the Zhem River‚Äù. The other part of Kuis is dedicated to some events in the lives of Kuishis or composers. (Qurmangazy‚Äôs Kui ‚ÄúAman bol sheshem, aman bol‚Äù means Take care, Mama, Take care; Tattimbet‚Äôs Kui ‚ÄúKokei kesti‚Äù internal disturbance; Dina‚Äôs ‚ÄúQaraqasqa at‚Äù means a dark horse with white spot on its head. Another group of Kuis is formed with Kuis dedicated to the birds and animals: folks‚Äô ‚ÄúBozingen‚Äù means white female camel, Telkqonyr- which is the name of a horse; Ashimtai‚Äôs ‚ÄúQonyr qaz‚Äù means ‚Äúbrown goose‚Äù; Sugir‚Äôs Kui ‚ÄúAqqu‚Äù means ‚Äúwhite swan‚Äù. So we can say that nomads expressed very thoroughly the environment of their daily life through Kuis. Kui tradition There are two musical types of Kuis; tokpe kuis (prevail in Western Kazakhstan) and shertpe kuis (Eastern, Southern and Central Kazakhstan). Shertpe kui differs from Tokpe kui in the sense of the theme, forms, and performance. Western tokpe Kuis reflect dramatic events, give very strong aggressive associations. These Kuis are composed according to its rules ‚Äìcertain sequence of tone sets on the Dombyra neck. Shertpe Kuis do not have such rules for composing. They are very melodic and seem to be a sound truck for songs. They are free in the style. They give very deep, gentle and soft associations. Most prominent composers of Tokpe Kuis are Qurmangazy, Dauletkerey, Qazangap, Abyl, Esir, Esbay, Dina, Seitek, etc. The biggest figure in Kui tradition is undoughtly Qurmangazy from western school of Kui tradition. He created the biggest hits among Kui compositions. Shertpe tradition is represented by Baizhigit, Tattimbet, Toqa, Dairabai, Sugur, Ryzdyq, Abiken, Tolegen and many others.

Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. Design and development A Dyn'A√©ro MCR4S under construction The MCR4S is a four-seat development of the Dyn'A√©ro MCR01 and retains many similarities. Both types are low wing, single engine monoplanes with T-tails. The major changes are an increase in fuselage length to accommodate an extra row of seats with generous windows and the replacement of the flaperons seen on the long span variants of the MCR01, which have wings of about the same span as those of the MCR4S, with slotted flaps. The wing and all control surfaces of the MCR4S have carbon fibre spars and ribs, to which preformed aluminium skins are glued. The wings have constant chord and carry 3¬∞ of dihedral. The ailerons are short, leaving the rest of the trailing edge of each wing divided between two double slotted, three position flaps. Winglets were introduced in 2001 and modified to have straight (in plan) trailing edges from 2002. The MCR4S has a T-tail with an all-moving tailplane. The fin is an integral part of the carbon fibre monocoque fuselage shell which also features a small ventral fin. The cabin seats up to four, depending on the variant, in two side-by-side rows. Entry is via the large, forward hinged, two piece canopy. Two large windows light the rear seats, the port side one doubling as an emergency exit. A variety of Rotax flat four engines may be fitted, driving a two or three blade propeller, which may have fixed or variable pitch. The MCRS4 has a tricycle undercarriage. The main wheels are mounted on short, vertical legs beneath the wings, as on the Club and ULC variants of the MCR01, with a track of 2.33 m (7 ft 8 in). All undercarriage wheels and legs are faired. The Dyn'A√©ro MCR4S flew for the first time on 14 June 2000. The MCR4S structure has been used by EADS Defence & Security for its EADS Surveyor 2500 drone. Operational history The first public appearance of the MCR4S was at the International Air Rally held at Cranfield just nine days after the first flight. French certification was gained in June 2001 (DGAC) and the first customer, aircraft designer Pierre Robin, flew his aircraft shortly afterwards.

It is a remake of the 2009 Tamil film Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu. This film marks the directorial debut of Tatineni Satya. It completed 100 days in Srikakulam town Keerthika and Chandramahal theatres and was a great hit. Story The story unfolds in a remote village near Vizag called Bheemli. What begins as a soft romance between a poor lad Suri (Nani) and a girl (Saranya Mohan) who comes to the village soon takes a turn. Suri, with his childhood friends, yearns to win a Kabaddi tournament. They're known for never managing to win a tournament. They find themselves by chance in a state-level tournament, expected to be knocked out in the first round. But the bunch of young men who share different thoughts and ideas, with the help of a professional kabbadi coach, emerge as winners. As they proceed, many difficulties are encountered such as Suri having a shoulder dislocation during a match. They win their remaining games and progress to the final. However, during this time, gangsters are searching for Suri. The final starts off poorly but, after half time, Bheemli Kabadi Jattu is back in contention. As the game ends in a tie, a player from each team goes up against each other. In the final stages of the head-to-head, Suri wins the game but dies after winning the last point as the opposition player kicks him on the chest as to touch him and win the game. Suri uses his last breath to win the match. The scene changes to several months later when the girl returns to the place they met searching for Suri. Suri's friend plans to tell her but discards it as he feels that she won't be able to withstand the sad news. Suri's mother is seen crying in her house with Suri's photograph beside her.

The palace was for secular uses and contained the living quarters, offices, the seminary and the printing house. A central, yellow-painted courtyard known as a Deyangshar separates the living quarters of the Lama and his monks with the Red Palace, the other side of the sacred Potala, which is completely devoted to religious study and prayer. It contains the sacred gold stupas‚Äîthe tombs of eight Dalai Lamas‚Äîthe monks' assembly hall, numerous chapels and shrines, and libraries for the important Buddhist scriptures, the Kangyur in 108 volumes and the Tengyur with 225. The Red Palace or Potrang Marpo is part of the Potala Palace that is completely devoted to religious study and Buddhist prayer. It consists of a complicated layout of many different halls, chapels and libraries on many different levels with a complex array of smaller galleries and winding passages: The main central hall of the Red Palace is the Great West Hall which consists of four great chapels that proclaim the glory and power of the builder of the Potala, the Fifth Dalai Lama. The hall is noted for its fine murals reminiscent of Persian miniatures, depicting events in the fifth Dalai Lama's life. The famous scene of his visit to Emperor Shun Zhi in Beijing is located on the east wall outside the entrance. Special cloth from Bhutan wraps the Hall's numerous columns and pillars. On the north side of this hall in the Red Palace is the holiest shrine of the Potala. A large blue and gold inscription over the door was written by the 19th century Tongzhi Emperor of China. proclaiming Buddhism a Blessed Field of Wonderful Fruit. On the floor below, a low, dark passage leads into the Dharma Cave where Songtsen Gampo is believed to have studied Buddhism. In the holy cave are images of Songtsen Gampo, his wives, his chief minister and Sambhota, the scholar who developed Tibetan writing in the company of his many divinities. The tomb of the 13th Dalai Lama is located west of the Great West Hall and it can only be reached from an upper floor and with the company of a monk or a guide of the Potala. Built in 1933, the giant stupa contains priceless jewels and one ton of solid gold. It is 14 metres (46 ft) high. Devotional offerings include elephant tusks from India, porcelain lions and vases and a pagoda made from over 200,000 pearls. Elaborate murals in traditional Tibetan styles depict many events of the life of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama during the early 20th century. Norbulingka Norbulingka The Norbulingka palace and surrounding park is situated in the west side of Lhasa, a short distance to the southwest of Potala Palace and with an area of around , it is considered to be the largest man made garden in Tibet. It was built from 1755.Tibet (1986), p.71 and served as the traditional summer residence of the successive Dalai Lamas until the 14th's self-imposed exile. Norbulingka was declared a ‚ÄòNational Important Cultural Relic Unit‚Äù, in 1988 by the State council. In 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Government in its 4th Tibet Session resolved to restore the complex to its original glory. Grant funds to the extent of 67.4 million Yuan (US$8.14 million) were sanctioned in 2002 by the Central Government for the restoration works; the restoration works taken up from 2003 mainly covered the Kelsang Phodron Palace, the Kashak Cabinet offices and many other structures. left The summer residence of the Dalai Lama is now a tourist attraction. The palace has a large collection of Italian chandeliers, Ajanta frescoes, Tibetan carpets and many other artifacts. Murals of Buddha and the 5th Dalai Lama are seen in some rooms. The 14th Dalai Lama‚Äôs (who fled from Tibet and took asylum in India) meditation room, bedroom, conference room and bathroom are part of the display explained to the tourists.Seth, pp.140‚Äì141 The Sho Dun Festival (popularly known as the \\"yogurt festival\\") is an annual festival held at Norbulingka during the seventh Tibetan month in the first seven days of the Full Moon period, which corresponds to dates in July/August according to the Gregorian calendar. The week-long festivities are marked by eating and drinking, with Ache Lhamo, the Tibetan opera performances as the highlight, held in the park and other venues in the city. On this occasion yak races are a special attraction held in the Lhasa stadium. During this festival, famed opera troupes from different regions of Tibet perform at the Narubulingka grounds; the first opera troupe was founded in the 15th century by Tangtong Gyelpo (considered the Leonardo da Vinci of Tibet). Over the centuries other opera formats of the 'White Masked Sect' and the \\"innovative\\" 'Black Masked Sect' added to the repertoire, and all these forms and subsequent innovations are enacted at the Sho Dun festival. Barkhor Newly renovated Barkhor The Barkhor is an area of narrow streets and a public square in the old part of the city located around Jokhang Temple and was the most popular devotional circumambulation for pilgrims and locals. The walk was about one kilometre long and encircled the entire Jokhang, the former seat of the State Oracle in Lhasa called the Muru Nyingba Monastery, and a number of nobles' houses including Tromzikhang and Jamkhang. There were four large incense burners (sangkangs) in the four cardinal directions, with incense burning constantly, to please the gods protecting the Jokhang.Dowman, Keith (1998). The Power-Places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide, pp. 40‚Äì41. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London and New York. . Most of the old streets and buildings have been demolished in recent times and replaced with wider streets and new buildings. Some buildings in the Barkhor were damaged in the 2008 unrest. Jokhang New Barkhor Square and Jokhang Temple Interior alt= The Jokhang is located on Barkhor Square in the old town section of Lhasa. It was founded around 642 during the reign of king Songtsen Gampo (605?‚Äì650 CE) to celebrate his marriage with Chinese Tang dynasty Princess Wencheng.Norbu and Turnbull 1969, p. 143 For most Tibetans it is the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. It is in some regards pan-sectarian, but is presently controlled by the Gelug school. Along with the Potala Palace, it is probably the most popular tourist attraction in Lhasa. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace,\\" and a spiritual centre of Lhasa. This temple has remained a key center of Buddhist pilgrimage for centuries. The circumambulation route is known as the \\"kora\\" in Tibetan and is marked by four large stone incense burners placed at the corners of the temple complex. After circumambulating the exterior, pilgrims make their way to the main hall of the temple which houses the Jowo Shakyamuni Buddha statue, perhaps the single most venerated object in Tibetan Buddhism. There are also famous statues of Chenresig, Padmasambhava and King Songtsen Gampo and his two foreign brides, Princess Wencheng (niece of Emperor Taizong of Tang) and Princess Bhrikuti of Nepal. Jokhang was sacked several times by the Mongols, but the building survived. In the past several centuries the temple complex was expanded and now covers an area of about 25,000 sq. meters The Jokhang temple is a four-story construction, with roofs covered with gilded bronze tiles. The architectural style is based on the Indian vihara design, and was later extended resulting in a blend of Nepalese and Tang dynasty styles. The rooftop statues of two golden deer flanking a Dharma wheel is iconic. Jokhang's interior is a dark and atmospheric labyrinth of chapels dedicated to various gods and bodhisattvas, illuminated by votive candles and thick with the smoke of incense. Although some of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain: the wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original; the Newari door frames, columns and finials date from the 7th and 8th centuries. The Jokhang owns a large and very important collection of about eight hundred metal sculptures, in addition to thousands of painted scrolls known as thangkas. The statues are hidden away in temples closed to the public and access is almost impossible. During numerous visits to the Jokhang between 1980 and 1996, Ulrich von Schroeder managed to take photographs of about five hundred metal statues of interest. Among them are some extremely rare and important brass and copper statues originating from Kashmir, Northern India, Nepal, Tibet, and China. However, the most important statues of the Jokhang collection are those that date back to the Yar lung dynasty (7th‚Äì9th century).von Schroeder, Ulrich. (2001). Buddhist Sculptures in Tibet. Vol. One: India & Nepal; Vol. Two: Tibet & China. (Volume One: 655 pages with 766 illustrations; Volume Two: 675 pages with 987 illustrations). Hong Kong: Visual Dharma Publications, Ltd. Tromzikhang Yak butter market in the Tromzikhang, 1993 Tromzikhang is a historic building located northwest of Jokhang which originally dated to around 1700 and was once a government building for officials such as the Ambans, representatives of the Qing emperor. It was demolished in the 1990s except for the magnificent facade. Today Tromzikhang is a notable market in Lhasa and a housing complex. Between 1938 and 1949, Tromzikhang was used as a Republican School, with a staff of Han, Hui and Tibetan teachers. It was built primarily for the local Han population of merchants with a number of staff from the Chinese Mission. Phuntsok Wangyal, a progressive pro-Communist Tibetan from Batang who founded the Tibetan Communist Party, also taught there for some time. The school taught pupils such as Gyalo Dondrup, the eldest brother of the 14th Dalai Lama as well as Nepalese and Muslim minorities living in Lhasa. The school was closed down in 1949 when the Chinese Mission was expelled from Tibet. The building is characterized by its length; it has a 63-metre (207 ft) facade. Architecturally it combines stylistic elements of monasteries and noble houses being symmetrical along a central axis, and hierarchical from down to up with large balconies and lavishly decorated interiors on the uppermost floor. Today Tromzikhang market sells items such as yak butter, cheese, tea, noodles, vegetables and candy. Nearby is Tromzikhang Bus Station and a mosque and a small 15th century building housing a two-story image of the Maitreya, named the Jamkhang. Muru Nyingba Monastery A street scene on Barkhor Street Muru Nyingba Monastery or Meru Nyingba is a small Buddhist monastery located behind Jokhang and Barkhor. It was the Lhasa seat of the former State Oracle who had his main residence at Nechung Monastery.Dowman (1998), p. 40. It is said that Emperor Songts√§n Gampo built the first building here and it is where the great Tibetan scholar, Thonmi Sambhota, completed his work developing the Tibetan alphabet in the first half of the 7th century. The present building, first constructed during the reign of King Ralpacan (c. 806‚Äì838 CE),Vitali (1990), p. 19. is built like an Indian vihara around a courtyard, with the lhakang ('temple', literally 'residence of the deity') to the north and monks quarters on the three other sides. The lhakang contains a number of fine murals ‚Äì the central image being that of Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), with images of the five Nyingma Yidam-Protectors and Tseumar and Tamdrin in glass cases around the walls. The Dhukang or Assembly Hall of Muru Nyingba is a very active temple, built in the 19th century by Nechung Khenpo Sakya Ngape, and renovated in 1986. There are frescoes portraying the protector deity Dorje Drakden, Tsongkhapa, Atisha, Padmasambhava, Shantarakshita, and King Trisong Detsen. The central image of Avalokiteshvara is new with a copper Padmasambhava to the right and a sand mandala to the left. Behind is an inner sanctum with more images and upstairs is the Tsepame Lhakang with 1,000 small images of Amitayas (or AmitƒÅbha) Buddha.Dorje (1999), pp. 88‚Äì89. The Lhasa Zhol Pillar The graceful Lhasa Zhol Pillar, below the Potala, dates as far back as circa 764 CE.Richardson (1985), p. 2. and is inscribed with what may be the oldest known example of Tibetan writing. The pillar contains dedications to a famous Tibetan general and gives an account of his services to the king including campaigns against China which culminated in the brief capture of the Chinese capital Chang'an (modern Xian) in 763 CESnellgrove and Richardson (1995), p. 91. during which the Tibetans temporarily installed as Emperor a relative of Princess Jincheng Gongzhu (Kim-sheng Kong co), the Chinese wife of Trisong Detsen's father, Me Agtsom.Richardson (1984), p. 30.Beckwith (1987), p. 148. Ramoche Temple right Jowo Mikyoe Dorje of the Ramoche Temple Ramoche Temple is considered the most important temple in Lhasa after the Jokhang Temple. Situated in the northwest of the city, it is east of the Potala and north of the Jokhang,Dowman, Keith. 1988. The Power- Places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide, p. 59. Routledge & Kegan Paul. London. (ppk). covering a total area of 4,000 square meters (almost one acre). Ramoche is considered to be the sister temple to the Jokhang which was completed about the same time. Tradition says that it was built originally to house the much revered Jowo Rinpoche statue, carried to Lhasa via Lhagang in a wooden cart, brought to Tibet when Princess Wencheng came to Lhasa. Unlike, the Jokhang, Ramoche was originally built in the Chinese style. During Mangsong Mangtsen's reign (649‚Äì676), because of a threat that the Tang Chinese might invade, Princess Wen Cheng is said to have had the statue of Jowo Rinpoche hidden in a secret chamber in the Jokhang. Princess Jincheng, sometime after 710 CE, had it placed in the central chapel of the Jokhang. It was replaced at Ramoche by a statue of Jowo Mikyo Dorje, a small bronze statue of the Buddha when he was eight years old, crafted by Vishvakarman, and brought to Lhasa by the Nepalese queen, Bhrikuti.Dorje (1999), p. 92.Tibet (6th edition), p. 104. (2005) Bradley Mayhew and Michael Kohn. Lonely Planet. . The temple was badly damaged during the Mongol invasions and there is no certainty that the statue that remained in 1959 was the original one. The original temple was destroyed by fire, and the present three-storied building was constructed in 1474. Soon after it became the Assembly Hall of the Gyuto Tratsang, or Upper Tantric College of Lhasa and was home to 500 monks. There was a close connection with Yerpa which provided summer quarters for the monks.Dorje (1999), pp. 92‚Äì93. The temple was gutted and partially destroyed in the 1960s and the bronze statue disappeared. In 1983 the lower part of it was said to have been found in a Lhasa rubbish tip, and the upper half in Beijing. They have now been joined and the statue is housed in the Ramoche Temple, which was partially restored in 1986, and still showed severe damage in 1993. Following the major restoration of 1986, the main building in the temple now has three stories. The first story includes an atrium, a scripture hall, and a Buddha palace with winding corridors. the second floor is mainly residential but has a chapel with an image of Buddha as King of the NƒÅgas. The third story contained the bedroom and chapel once reserved for Dalai LamaDorje (1999), p. 93. Upon entering the main building, one can see the ten large fluted pillars holding some of the remaining Tibetan relics such as the encased lotus flowers, coiling cloud, jewelry, and particular Tibetan characters. The golden peak of the temple with the Han-style upturned eave can be seen from any direction in Lhasa city. The temple is an interesting example of the combination of Han and Tibetan architectural styles. Today it is an important repository of Tibetan artifacts. Lingkhor The path led past the Potala to a pond Lingkhor is a sacred path, most commonly used to name the outer pilgrim road in Lhasa matching its inner twin, Barkhor. The Lingkhor in Lhasa was long enclosing Old Lhasa, the Potala and Chokpori hill. In former times it was crowded with men and women covering its length in prostrations, beggars and pilgrims approaching the city for the first time. The road passed through willow-shaded parks where the Tibetans used to picnic in summer and watch open air operas on festival days. New Lhasa has obliterated most of Lingkhor, but one stretch still remains west of Chokpori. Chagpori Chokpori seen from Potala Chagpori, meaning 'Iron Mountain', is a sacred hill, located south of the Potala. It is considered to be one of the four holy mountains of central Tibet and along with two other hills in Lhasa represent the \\"Three Protectors of Tibet.\\", Chagpori (Vajrapani), Pongwari (Manjushri), and Marpori (Chenresig or Avalokiteshvara). It was the site of the most famous medical school Tibet, known as the Mentsikhang, which was founded in 1413. It was conceived of by Lobsang Gyatso, the \\"Great\\" 5th Dalai Lama, and completed by the Regent Sangye Gyatso (Sangs-rgyas rgya-mtsho)Dowman, Keith. (1988). The Power-Places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide, p. 49. Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd., London. . shortly before 1697. The medical school and a temple housing priceless statutes of coral (Tsepame), mother-of-pearl (of Tujechempo) and turquoise (of Drolma) were completely demolished by PLA artillery in 1959 after the Lhasa uprising. It is now crowned by unsightly radio antennas.Mayhew, Bradley and Kohn, Michael. Tibet. 6th Edition (2005), p. 103. Lonely Planet. .French, Patrick. Tibet, Tibet: A Personal History of a Lost Land. (2003), p. 143. Alfred A Knopf. New York. . Tibet Museum The Tibet Museum in Lhasa is the official museum of the Tibet Autonomous Region and was inaugurated on October 5, 1999. It is the first large-sized modern museum in the Tibet Autonomous Region and has a permanent collection of around 1000 artefacts, from examples of Tibetan art to architectural design throughout history such as Tibetan doors and beams. It is located in an L-shaped building, located directly below the Potala Palace on the corner of Norbulingkha Road. The modern museum building fuses together traditional Tibetan architecture with the modern. It is a grey brick building with dark brown and white roof furnishings with a golden orange gilded roof. The museum is structured into three main sections: a main exhibition hall, a folk cultural garden and an administrative quarter. The central courtyard to the museum is uniquely designed, with a white, sleek looking floor, and drawing upon traditional monastic conventions. It features an origin, black and white design in the centre and has lighting through large skylight windows above. The museum covers an area of 53,959 square meters, with a total construction area of 23,508 square meters. The area for the exhibition department covers 10,451 square meters. The History of Tibetan Culture Exhibition is divided into pre-history culture, indivisible history, culture and arts, and people's customs, exploring several thousand years of Tibetan history, politics, religion, cultural arts, and customs. Items include Tibetan-script books, documents and scrolls, the arts of Tibetan theatre, Tibetan musical instruments, Tibetan medicine, Tibetan astronomy and calendar reckoning (including charts), Tibetan sculpture, and thangka painting and arts. The exhibited artefacts are protected by the Tibetan Autonomous Region Cultural Relics Protection Organization given the uniqueness and cultural value of some of the items. There are numerous statues of buddhas, bodhisattvas, and figures, masks, rare sutras written on pattra leaves and birch bars, and manuscripts written with gold, silver and coral powder. There are many items of Tibetan handicrafts, and invaluable jewellery such as gold, silver and jade items. Potala Square and Anniversary Monument Tibet Peaceful Liberation Monument, Potala Square The Monument to the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was unveiled on the Potala Square on May 23, 2002 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and the work in the development of the autonomous region since then. The 37-metre-high monument is shaped as an abstract Mount Everest and is engraved with the calligraphy of its name by President Jiang Zemin, with an inscription describing the socioeconomic development experienced in Tibet in the past fifty years.

They are studied primarily in the field of fusion energy, where the lack of complex magnets and a simple geometry may allow the construction of dramatically simpler and less expensive fusion reactors. The two best studied compact toroids are the spheromak and field-reversed configuration (FRC). A third configuration, the particle ring, does not appear to have attractive performance. The spheromak configuration is similar in arrangement to a smoke ring. The FRC is also toroidal, but extended into a tubular shape or hollow cylinder. The main difference between the two is that the spheromak contains poloidal (vertical rings) and toroidal (horizontal) magnetic fields, while the FRC has only the poloidal fields and requires an external magnet for confinement. In both cases the combination of electrical currents and their associated magnetic fields result in a series of closed magnetic lines that maintains the ring shape, without the need for magnets in the center of the plasma (unlike a tokamak). Of the two, the FRC naturally has a higher beta, a measure of fusion economics. However, the spheromak had generated better confinement times and temperatures, and recent work suggests that great advances in performance can be made. Compact toroids are also similar to the spherical tokamak, and many spherical tokamak machines were converted from earlier spheromak reactors.

It was formed as a resurgent of Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Company Incorporated (BLTBCo.), one of the oldest provincial bus companies in the Philippines. It plies routes mainly to Southern Luzon provinces and other parts in Eastern Visayas region. DLTBCo. was founded in 2010 when BLTBCo. was taken over by DMMW and later added to its investment, although one must take note that DLTBCo. and BLTBCo. are different companies from each other, but their similarity is its routes that the latter have. It was because the former has announced its restoration of the old routes made by the latter after the firm's take over. BLTBCo., on the other hand, was founded in 1918 shortly before the end of World War I. Thus, DLTBCo is one of the nation's oldest bus firms if the BTLBCo history and timeline are included. Etymology The company was derived from the union of two small bus companies‚ÄîBTCo. and LTB. BTCo. stands for Batangas Transportation Company, while LTB stands for Laguna Tayabas Bus Company. The union was made by Max Blouse, an American seargeant who fought in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. After the war, he decided to stay in the Philippines. History DLTBCo bus terminal, Taft Avenue, Pasay City Before proceeding to its present history, it is important to know about the historical background of BLTBCo., so that we may be able to see the difference between the past and the present history (DLTBCo.) 1918 It was in 1918 when Max Blouse began his business ventures and he founded the Batangas Transportation Company (BTCo). Starting with only one \\"calesa-like tires with wooden spokes\\" bus, Max Blouse performed a wondrous task of being the driver, conductor and repairman for the whole operation. Through his handwork and dedication, he eventually acquired 17 more units of the passenger vehicles painted in red that people fondly called \\"pula\\" - the basis of today's DLTBCo bus livery. 1928 As a result of the thriving operation in the transportation business, Max Blouse in 1928 incorporated BTCo with his newly established bus company dubbed as Laguna Tayabas Bus Company (LTB), concentrating in the area of Laguna and Tayabas. The two enterprises he had installed apportioned a conspicuous achievement until the disruption of the Second World War. The remnants of the war resulted to an intense damage and decline of the company's business activities. All operations were closed, records were destroyed and most of the company-owned buildings were ravaged by the war. In spite of the miscarriage during those times, Max Blouse never lost his forbearance and intensified his effort to raise back the company's destroyed properties. 1945 Under a \\"Joint Emergency Operations\\" agreement on May 22, 1945, the two corporations proceeded its operation with 28 Chevrolet buses which Max Blouse acquired from the US army. Again, through his diligence and high-spirited deeds, he enabled a spectacular stride by bringing back the prosperity that the company savored prior to the war. The pressing demand for public transportation also moved him to respond immediately by providing the people's need to commute from one place to another as the country suffered from the debris of the war. 1961‚Äì1964 The death of Max Blouse on December 28, 1961 posted a challenge to Col. Pelagio G. Potenciano, a doctor by profession, who took the place of his father-in-law's designation as president. Albeit the fact the Colonel Potenciano did not have enough skills on the transportation business, he was bale to manage the two corporations well through his dedication and industry. It was during his administration where the BTCo and LTB finally merged into one company and was approved by the company's stockholder in 1964, thus, creating a new name termed as the Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Company (BLTBCo). 1977‚Äì1988 Colonel Potenciano's son Max, nicknamed \\"Sonny\\", became the president from 1977 up to 1988. Just like his grandfather and that of his dad, strong determination, and the will to succeed had inspired him to propel all the accomplishments into the limelight. With the full support of his loving wife Dolly Alonso and four sons namely Joey, Binky, Mike and Snooky the company realized its targets and was able to cope with the stiff competition in the transportation business. In 1988, a new formula was instilled into the company's management milieu by a new woman president in the person of Dolores Alonso Potenciano, wife of Max B. Potenciano. When she took her position as president, re-structuring was adopted by modifying BLTBCo. into a multi-million enterprise having an all-Filipino management. (The company was originally in partnership by Max Blouse and his American associates). During the course of her supervision as president, Mrs. Potenciano adapted a lot of changes and development in the whole operation. Her good dispositions and adeptness in yielding ingenious ideas propped up growth and changes in the entire company. 1997‚Äì2003 BLTBCo was under the management of its new chairman and chief executive officer Benjamin M. Bitanga, a business associate of the company. Taking over as president less than a year before, under Bitanga the company continued servicing the people from the southern part of Luzon and areas within the provinces of Samar and Leyte. However in 2001, Potenciano family had their political ambitions in Laguna. With them spending much on it. They lost the elections. The company's problem continued with series of lawsuits from their employees due to unfair labor practice and violation of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). It was also the time when Bitanga and Potenciano clans had disputes over the management of the company. In 2003, a fire erupted at Malibay that reached over their bus terminal. The fire destroyed many of their bus fleets including their repair garage. The company discontinues business for six years.DLTBCo Kia Granbird 2009‚Äìpresent After the suspended operations and renovation for six years, In 2009, Del Monte Motor Works (DMMW), a bus and truck manufacturer based in Quezon City took over the management of BLTBCo. They rename the company as Del Monte Land Transport Bus Company (DLTBCo), and continues routes to Metro Manila via Laguna, Quezon Province, Batangas Province, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte & Albay. With the help of the new management, they provided new bus units for the company and offers new services such as free Wi-Fi and their \\"Greyhound Express Service\\". Issues and criticisms The issue on labor union in BLTBCo has caused up to pay for its damages filed by their employees. In 1973, during the Martial Law, a group of private respondents, totaling 34 employees, led by bus conductors Librado Aquino and Eufemio Bondad, demanded the company for backwages and separation pay. These employees were detained by the military due to alleged involvement in the defraudation of the fund of the company. The management also refused to give them back pay. In the decision by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), favoring the decision to the complainants, the management forced to give separation pay to the employees. Consecutive strikes led by labor union leaders of the company were able to file cases against the management due to unfair labor practice and violation of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). BLTBCo management forced to pay those employees who led the strike in two consecutive years. The bankruptcy of BLTBCo was caused by the involvement of one member of Potenciano family to run for governor in Laguna, but failed to win in the 2001 local elections. This time, the labor union filed a class suit against the management. By then, BLTBCo has again, a troubled history when the Potenciano clan strongly refused to give up the bus company to its investors. As a result, the company was totally crippled by financial losses and mismanagement for six years. The Bitanga and Potenciano clans have disputes on the management of the company. Fleet A DLTBCo 15M at the Legazpi Grand Central Terminal, A DM14 BLTBCo has maintained MAN, Hino, UD Nissan Diesel, Mercedes-Benz, Isuzu, and Mitsubishi Fuso units from the time of re-fleeting between 1988 and 2001. Unfortunately, all of its buses were already defunct, while others were turned into ashes by the tragic 2003 fire along Malibay. When Del Monte Motor Works, Inc. took over the management, their coachbuilding division provides additional bus units. With those units manufactured by Del Monte such as the DM10, DM11, DM12, and DM14s, the company has maintained most of the old routes and presently they have Ashok Leyland, Hino, Hyundai, MAN, Kia, Kinglong & Yutong units.

The Pandoran ecology forms a vast neural network spanning the entire lunar surface into which the Na ºvi and other creatures can connect. The strength of this collective consciousness is illustrated when the human invaders are defeated in battle by the Pandoran ecology, after the Na ºvi were nearly defeated. Cameron utilized a team of expert advisors in order to make the various examples of fauna and flora as scientifically feasible as possible. Na ºvi=Appearance In Avatar, the Na ºvi are an indigenous species that live on Pandora. They are humanoid in appearance and are tall, having pairs of eyes, ears, arms, legs and feet like humans, as well as a nose, a mouth, and expressions recognizable to humans. The Na ºvi differ from humans in having blue striped skin, pointed and mobile ears, large eyes, catlike noses and tails, and hands each with three fingers and a thumb (hybrid avatars, on the other hand, retain the five-fingered hands of their human DNA). While taller than humans, they have narrower proportions in body frame. Their bones are reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber. The Na ºvi also have a distinctive tendril feature protruding from the back of their heads, surrounded by hair (resembling a long plait or queue), feeding directly into the brain. This organ allows them to connect with other organisms around them, transferring electrochemical signals such as thoughts and memories to the trees, plants, and other creatures. In the original script, Cameron refers to these as \\"Jubilees\\", although the word is not used in the film and may be changed by the time the novel is published. The Na ºvi were initially conceived to be more alien in appearance. Cameron recalled that when one of the main characters, Neytiri, was originally drawn, she had gills and other protuberances. In addition to feline features, the species was redesigned to seem more human so that audiences could better relate to it. According to Cameron, the appearance of the Na ºvi character Neytiri had some specific inspirations and requirements: she was inspired by Raquel Welch's character in Fantastic Voyage and by Vampirella, noting in the latter's case, \\"the fact [Vampirella] didn't exist didn't bother me because we have these quintessential female images in our mind, and in the case of the male mind, they're grossly distorted. When you see something that reflects your id, it works for you.... Right from the beginning I said, 'She's got to have tits,' even though that makes no sense because her race, the Na ºvi, aren't placental mammals. I designed her costumes based on a taparrabo, a loincloth worn by Mayan Indians.\\" This is somewhat of a non-sequitor because both marsupials (kangaroos, etc.) and monotremes (platypuses, etc.) are non-placental and yet both lactate. This objective of making the Na'vi as humanlike as possible can also be seen as an explanation as to why they are quadrupedal despite having evolved from common ancestors of the hexapodal lemurs seen in the film. Cameron has described Avatar as more \\"science fantasy\\" than true science fiction and has said that he would explain in the novel for the film why in the fictional universe the Na ºvi look like humans. Culture and language According to Entertainment Weekly, \\"The Na ºvi can commune with animals on their planet by literally plugging their braid into the creatures' nerve systems. To become a warrior, a Na ºvi must tame and ride a flying creature known as Ikran.\\" The Na ºvi also use this neural bonding system, called \\"tsaheylu\\", to mate with a \\"life partner\\", a bond that, when made, cannot be broken in the Na ºvi's lifetime. This is akin to human marriage. The Na ºvi way of life revolves around their religion, and the Home Tree. The Na ºvi sleep in hammocks in large groups for comfort and as a warning system. Conceived for the film was the Na ºvi language, a constructed language often spoken by the actors when they played Na ºvi characters. The Na ºvi language was created by communications professor emeritus and linguistics consultant Paul Frommer of the University of Southern California. He designed the language so as to be speakable by human actors, combining syntactic and grammatical rules from other existing languages. Frommer created over a thousand words for the Na ºvi language and coached the actors who narrated Na ºvi characters. When communicating to humans in the film, Na ºvi characters ‚Äì especially Neytiri ‚Äì speak in accented and broken English. Human visitors see the Na ºvi as possessing a religion, whose chief and possibly sole deity is a benevolent goddess known as Eywa. The Na ºvi are able to physically connect to Eywa when they use their braids to connect to the Tree of Souls and other similar flora which function as the global brain's interfaces. Eywa is said to have a connection to all things Pandoran. Political power is exceedingly diffused, with each clan being a sovereign entity under either the diarchical rule of both a temporal chieftain (known as an Olo'eyktan) and a spiritual chieftain (known as a Tsahik), or the monarchical rule of a single individual who holds the two separate offices simultaneously. The numerous clans are seemingly only ever brought together as a tribe by Toruk Makto, a messianic war chief whose office is both non-permanent and apparently the only one with an authority that covers the entire race of Na ºvi. By the time of the film, there had only been five Toruk Maktos in the history of the tribe, and the last one had ruled no fewer than four generations before the present day. This may be due to the fact that the Toruk Maktos seem to draw their power from a situation of explicitly external danger, and therefore are not really necessary for the day to day internal running of the tribal clans. Succession to the various offices is smooth, however, based more on popular recognition and customary worthiness than on anything else, and respect for hierarchical superiors appears to be high. Fauna James Cameron's core idea for the Avatars fictional creatures was for them to be \\"superslick and aerodynamic, and be like a race car with racing stripes\\". Neville Page worked on Avatar as the lead creature designer. He, Wayne Barlowe (author, artist, and initial lead creature designer), and Yuri Bartoli (concept designer and supervising virtual art director) adapted Cameron's conceptions of the fauna into a design that served three purposes: to appear expressive, to function with animation technology, and to seem realistic. He and creature designer Wayne Barlowe sought to base the design of Pandora's creatures on race cars, but they struggled to adapt the concept. Page drew on his education in automotive design, recognizing the irony that race cars were based on real-life animals in having \\"bone lines\\". Existing automotive designs drew from seashells, turtle shells, and insects, so the designers returned the design to the fictional creatures. They found that the prime challenge in designing most creatures was to give them organic appearances, including skin texture. Some creatures were also designed to have special breathing holes located in the trachea, copying how cars have intakes. Challenges that the creatures posed for visual effects technicians were to form \\"walk and run\\" cycles for six-legged creatures and to impart credible flying for creatures that had four wings. Many of the animals also have four eyes, with an apparent major and minor eye on either side of their head. The fictional creatures are not connected telepathically according to Cameron and the designers. However, even though they discussed the idea of the creatures being part of Pandora's \\"Worldmind\\", they preferred to interpret the creatures as having heightened instincts. Page explained, \\"Animals are hooked up to this planet. We're the ones who are detached.... The way I dealt with it was, We have so much rich [material] here to reference, that we don't have to dream up a whole new process of animal awareness.\\" The fictional moon has less gravity than Earth, so the creatures' larger sizes match their environment. Most Pandoran wildlife is hexapodal, or six-legged. Much of the fauna and flora is bioluminescent, which is seen in creatures on Earth such as fireflies, many deep sea animals, and some microscopic algae. The aforementioned breathing holes, located on multiple parts of a creature's body other than the mouth, are similar to spiracles in some of Earth's animals. The flying reptile-like creatures in the film can be compared to extinct flying reptiles such as pterosaurs and to the modern gliding lizard Draco sumatranus. List of fauna * Direhorse (Pa'li in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The direhorse is a bioluminescent, hexapodal, superficially equine animal. It is scientifically known as Equidirus hoplites. The Na ºvi use the direhorse to hunt. The direhorse was conceived and designed by Cameron and Stan Winston Studios. The direhorse is grey with blue stripes and stands tall, long. The Na ºvi \\"break\\" a direhorse by connecting the fleshy tip of their hair to the animal's antennae. Xenobiologists call this a neural whip. Once intertwined, the Na ºvi rider can communicate motor commands instantly through the neural interface; however, this connection does not lead to a lifelong, exclusive bond, as it does with the mountain banshee. Cameron described the creature as a \\"six-legged alien Clydesdale with moth-like antennae\\". The direhorse uses its long tongue to eat the sap out of pitcher plants. * Mountain Banshee (Ikran in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The mountain banshee is an airborne predator which lives in mountainous territory on Pandora. Na ºvi warriors attempt to bond with a banshee, a dangerous and required rite of passage. They are cousins to the great leonopteryx and they are scientifically known by xenobiologists as Pterodactylus giganteus. A banshee bonds to a Na ºvi warrior for life. They are four-winged creatures that, like the leonopteryx and direhorse, have a biologically produced carbon fiber flexing on the skin. Neytiri had a banshee named Seze (translated from the language of the Na ºvi roughly as \\"blue flower\\"). Page spent the most time designing the banshee for the film so it would be convincing when it flew or perched. The designer said, \\"The hardest thing of all was having a Na ºvi on top of it and flying it. You had to backwards engineer it. It was like designing and engineering an aircraft.\\" Barlowe, who contributed to the banshee's design, was influenced by manta rays and skates as well as relatively little-known pterosaurs and plesiosaurs that had \\"many, unique aerodynamic and hydrodynamic\\" characteristics. Like the color scheme for the great leonopteryx, color schemes based on Earth animals were used for various banshees, though Page was inspired by Art Nouveau prints to warp the schemes so they would not look familiar to film audiences. * Great Leonopteryx (Toruk in Na ºvi, meaning last shadow) ‚Äì The great leonopteryx is the apex airborne predator native to Pandora. It is scientifically known as Leonopteryx rex, meaning \\"king lion-wing\\". The fierce beauty and nobility of the leonopteryx gave the species a place central to Na ºvi lore and culture. The leonopteryx is scarlet with black stripes and a midnight blue crest on top of the head and on the lower jaw. It is celebrated in dance and song; elaborate totems symbolize both the fear and respect accorded to the creature. The leonopteryx is considered crucial to the Na ºvi sense of destiny and interconnectedness. Prior to the events of the film, it had only been tamed five times, and Neytiri tells Jake that the riders (Toruk Makto) brought peace among the Pandoran tribes. This makes Jake the sixth Toruk Makto. He manages to capture one by jumping on it from above from his banshee but releases it after the battle with the humans has ended. The great leonopteryx and the banshee were designed with bright colors. Page based the colors on Earth's birds, poison dart frogs, and monarch butterflies, though he altered the patterns so that their inspirations would not be so conspicuous to moviegoers. The skull and crest shapes appear to be derived from pterosaurs from the genus Tapejara. * Hammerhead Titanothere ('Angts√¨k in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The hammerhead titanothere is a large hexapodal herbivore whose massive, low-slung head features bony projections on either side of the skull, similar to those of hammerhead sharks. These protrusions are often used to push and destroy objects: a single sideways thrust of the neck being sufficient to down a significantly sized tree. The titanothere has exceedingly thick, gray skin. There is a small \\"fan\\" feather structure on the head that it flares up as a warning symbol seen in the film and in the video game. The creature, which resembles a cross between a rhinoceros and a hammerhead shark, is easily aroused. Its hide is impervious to small arms fire, though firing on it is known to anger it. This massive, grazing creature travels in moderately large herds or packs of 10‚Äì20 animals. Avatar creature designer Yuri Bartoli explained about the creature's colorful threat display: \\"Originally, the hammerhead just had to be a huge creature, big enough that even a thanator would think twice about attacking one. A threat display is meant to be seen, so it required bright colors that would stand out against its more muted body\\". It is moderately social, but also extremely territorial and hierarchical. A soft ungulate mouth is protected by a rigid, beak-like jaw structure. The species is scientifically known as Titanotheris hammercephalis. In the climax of the film, a bunch of hammerhead titanothere assist the Na ºvi in their battle against Colonel Miles Quaritch's army. * Hexapede (Yerik in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The hexapede are hexapodal deer-like creatures. They are dark blue herbivores with white and yellow stripes. Twin horn structures sheathe a thin, patterned membrane structure. Their small, sloped skull is topped by this light-colored fan structure. This fan has an eye pattern on it similar to those found in actual insects. A skin membrane hangs under the jaw and runs the length of the neck. Twin lines of dark hairlike bristles run down the hexapede's back. The antennae are at the back at the head. As a threat display, the hexapede flares up its twin membrane structure like a satellite dish and retracts both lips. It is scientifically known as Sexcruscervus caeruleus. * Prolemuris (Syaksyuk in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The prolemuris are blue, hexapodal creatures based on Earth's lemurs. They have two eyes, small nostrils, and their two upper arms on each side are partially fused. Like most Pandoran creatures, they have a queue on the back of their heads. They have lateral skin membranes on each side of the body. They have large eyes and grow 1.5 meters tall. * Thanator (Palulukan in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The thanator is a large hexapodal land predator that is believed, by the RDA, to be the apex land predator. It is scientifically known as Bestiapanthera ferox. Cameron personally designed the creature. The thanator is first seen when Jake wanders off into the jungle and touches multiple helicoradian leaves, at which they retract to reveal a family of hammerhead titanotheres behind. The thanator frightens the titanotheres and pursues Jake. Jake later escapes the thanator by jumping off a cliff into pool below. It later appears during the climax where it assists Neytiri and later battles Quaritch's AMP Suit Beyond Glory, but is killed by the AMP suit's knife. The thanator is black with white fleshy skin under each hand. Its appearance is similar to a panther; Cameron describes the thanator as \\"the panther from hell\\". The thanator has ten sensory quills connected to six pads at the rear of the skull that flare up before it attacks the prey. The director explained how the thanator is the most fearsome creature on Pandora, \\"The thanator could eat a T-Rex and have the Alien for dessert.\\" * Viperwolf (Nantang in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The viperwolf is a hexapodal nocturnal carnivore. The species is scientifically known as Caniferratus costatus. It has bioluminescence for pack identification. Cameron described the viperwolves: \\"[They are] hairless with shiny skin that looks like overlapped armor. Most disturbing are its paws, which are like leathery hands.\\" They are vicious in combat but treat their babies in a loving, nurturing way. They are seen in the daytime caring for their babies and have green eyes. They have a laugh which sounds like Earth's hyenas. Like most Pandoran creatures, they have antennae. They have opposable thumbs allowing them to climb trees as well as stalk from the ground, thereby are able to create a three-dimensional hunting field. Flora The Helicoradian plants in Avatar were based on Spirobranchus giganteus, a species of tube worm common to many seas on Earth. These worms quickly withdraw into their tubes when disturbed. Flora on Pandora are of a tropical type several times taller than that existing on Earth. Many, if not all, plant and animal species have bioluminescent properties. The flora specimens seen in the film were all designed by Jodie Holt, a professor of botany at the University of California, Riverside. According to Holt, Pandoran flora are able to communicate with each other through signal transduction and are larger in size than Earth flora due to greater atmospheric thickness, weaker gravity, and stronger magnetism on Pandora. List of flora * Helicoradian (Loreyu in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The Helicoradian is a carnivorous plant that has red spiral-leaves. The plants are up to tall and, when touched, instantly curl and collapse into themselves. They are zooplantae, part animal, part plant. They are first seen when Jake wanders off into a forest of Helicoradia and touches multiple leaves, at which they retract and coil up to reveal a hammerhead titanothere behind. According to Avatar designer Craig Shoji, the behavior and design of the Helicoradian was based on the Christmas tree worms, tube worms that reside on coral reefs. In the video games, the species has the ability to heal the player. * Obesus rotundus (Rumut in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The Obesus rotundus is a tree that resembles a puffball tree. * Pseudocycas altissima (Tsyorina'wll in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The Pseudocycas altissima is a plant akin to a tall Earth cycad. * The Hometrees (Kelutral in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The Hometrees are great enough to house hundreds of clan members. The trees are honeycombed with natural hollows and alcoves in which the Na ºvi sleep, eat, weave, dance, and celebrate their connection to Eywa. Adult Hometrees are more than tall, and roughly in diameter. The Omaticaya inhabit a Giant Hometree, standing roughly tall. A distinguishable feature of the movie landscape, the tree itself is central to the movie story arc. Like many sacred sites on Pandora, the Giant Hometree sits above a large deposit of unobtanium. It is destroyed by the humans using rockets and missiles, which leads to the Na ºvi clans' alliance against the humans. * ' (Ayvitray√§ Ramunong in Na ºvi [Cameron: Vitraya Ramunong]) ‚Äì The Tree of Souls is a tree where the Na ºvi are able to communicate with the biological network that exists throughout Pandora. Cameron described the Tree of Souls as \\"a big input-output station\\", having been inspired by the bioluminescence that he encountered during night diving. In the film, the tree is seen to be capable of transferring a specific consciousness from one body to another. * ' (Utral Aymokriy√§ in Na ºvi [Cameron: Utraya Mokri]) ‚Äì The Tree of Voices are the most important trees to the Na ºvi after the Tree of Souls. They are smaller the Tree of Souls, but their appearance is quite similar and they too are illuminated. Neytiri reveals to Jake the tree allows the Na ºvi to hear the voices of their ancestors. They are destroyed in the bulldozer attack by the humans. This was where Jake and Neytiri chose each other as mates and mated before Eywa. * Woodsprites (Atokirina in Na ºvi) ‚Äì The Woodsprites are seeds of the \\"holy tree\\", appearing similar to airborne jellyfish. Neytiri describes them as very pure spirits, and slaps Jake for shooing two of them away. The Omaticaya Clan plants one of these seeds with the body of a deceased Na ºvi, so the Na ºvi's consciousness will become part of Eywa. Various other plants and trees that look like Earth's ferns, palm trees, mosses, grasses, bamboo, and succulents. Several forest plants of Pandora resemble the Earth's zoanthid soft corals, which can be bioluminescent as in the movie.

Background Langston Hughes was known as one of the most prominent and influential figures of the Harlem Renaissance, a rebirth movement of African Americans in the arts during the 1920s. He wrote about the world around him, giving a voice to African Americans during a time of segregation. Hughes was both a contributor and supporter of his fellow African-American writers. Collectively, they changed the way the world viewed African Americans because of their talents and ability to capture real life and turn it into art. Hughes wrote of inequality (\\"I, Too‚Äù), of resilience (\\"Mother to Son\\" and \\"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\\"), of pride (\\"My People\\"), of hope (\\"Freedom's Plow\\"), and of music (\\"The Trumpet Player\\" and \\"Juke Box Love Song\\"). He was the author of several novels, a memoir, song lyrics, children's books, plays, countless songs and more than 20 books. \\"The Weary Blues\\" takes place at an old Harlem bar on Lenox Avenue. There is a piano player playing the blues. As he plays, the speaker observes his body movement and the tone of his voice. Throughout the poem, several literary devices are used to guide the reader through the mixture of emotions the blues player is feeling. The vivid imagery and use of language gives the reader a more personal glimpse into the life of the man playing the blues. Theme and literary devices Langston Hughes wrote ‚ÄúThe Weary Blues‚Äù in 1925 during Prohibition and the Harlem Renaissance. The setting of the poem is actually unclear, at first. However, as it goes on it is obvious the speaker is in a bar, or was. The speaker is telling a story. He starts by setting the mood with an alliteration, ‚Äúdroning a drowsy syncopated tune / Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon‚Äù. The narrator wants his listener and reader to get a feel for the story he is about to tell. He wants people to know that he enjoyed the experience. Yet, his tone is unhurried and nonchalant, like he just happened to stumble across ‚Äúthe tune o‚Äô those Weary Blues.‚Äù He was in a bar that provided entertainment. Once the speaker finishes his rendition of the musician‚Äôs song, the setting changes. At the end of the poem, the reader ends up in the musician‚Äôs home. ‚ÄúThe Weary Blues‚Äù is written in free verse; however, all the lines that are not lyrics to the Weary Blues are rhyming couplets: ‚ÄúDown on Lenox Avenue the other night / By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light.‚Äù Night and light rhyme just like tune-croon, key-melody, stool-fool and all the other couplets. The rhymes are not perfect, but when read out loud the rhyme scheme is pleasing to the ear. It is also worth noting that the poem ends with three rhyming lines: ‚Äúthe singer stopped playing and went to bed / While the Weary Blues echoed through his head / He slept like a rock or a man that‚Äôs dead.‚Äù The last three lines are a finite conclusion. The rest of the poem builds and builds until its end. The music in ‚ÄúThe Weary Blues‚Äù is a metaphor for life as a black man. The color in the poem is symbolic of the black struggle. It starts with slave spirituals in which ‚Äúslaves calculatingly created songs of double-entendre as an intellectual strategy‚ÄùMcInnis, C Liegh. Review of Nothing but Love in God's Waters: Volume 1: Black Sacred Music from the Civil War to the Civil Rights Movement, by Robert Darden. Southern Quarterly, vol. 52, no. 2, 2015, pp. 192‚Äì195. as Hughes does in his poem. When he says, ‚ÄúI heard a Negro play‚Äù he is making the musician decidedly black. The lines ‚Äúwith his ebony hands on each ivory key / He made that poor piano moan with melody‚Äù continues the reference to color, and decidedly differentiates black from white. Hughes personifies the piano with a humanly moan, but the moan also indicates his abuse of the ‚Äúivory key‚Äù and the ‚Äúmelancholy tone‚Äù of the music. However, the poem is a celebration of blues. In lines eleven, fourteen and sixteen there are apostrophes to the blues. ‚ÄúO Blues!‚Äù and ‚ÄúSweet Blues‚Äù are the speaker's exclamations of delight. He just cannot contain himself when it comes to the blues. He even notices the musician enjoying the music and adds the onomatopoeia of a ‚Äúthump, thump, thump.‚Äù The Weary Blues is an enjoyable poem and song, yet its message is one of sadness. Reception \\"The Weary Blues\\" is one of Hughes's most famous poems. Critics have claimed that the poem is a combination of blues and jazz with personal experiences. It embodies blues as a metaphor and form. It has also been coined as one of the first works of blues performance in literature. Throughout the poem, music is seen as not only a form of art and entertainment, but also as a way of life: people living the blues. Hughes's ability to incorporate poetry with music and history with art has given him the reputation as one of the leading black artists of the 20th century. \\"The Weary Blues\\" allows the reader to seek to unlock the mystery of the blues, for both the musician and themselves. Langston Hughes slow jams \\"The Weary Blues\\" (1925) to jazz accompaniment with the Doug Parker Band on the CBUT (CBC Vancouver) program \\"The 7 O'Clock Show\\" in 1958. Host, Bob Quintrell introduces the performance.

While the central section of the line, which is shared with the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìFlensburg line, has two tracks and is electrified, its western and eastern sections are single track and are not electrified. It connects the cities of Husum and Kiel via Rendsburg and serves as an important east-west rail axis between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Historically, the line ran from Husum to Kiel via Erfde and Rendsburg. The current line runs via J√ºbek, Schleswig and Rendsburg, with the J√ºbek‚ÄìRendsburg section being shared with the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìFlensburg line. The line was opened in 1854 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. Route VT729 of the NOB near J√ºbek NOB train on the Rendsburg Loop The line begins in the third Husum station, which was opened in 1910 for the line to Erfde and Rendsburg. This station is the main hub of the North Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein. In addition to the trains to and from Kiel it is served by the trains of the Marsh Railway and the Husum‚ÄìBad St. Peter-Ording line. The line runs to Kiel through flat geest lands to the northeast and reaches the M√ºhlenbach stream in Ohrstedt. There are no stations until J√ºbek. Several stations along the line were abandoned in the early 1980s and are only served by freight trains. From J√ºbek the line runs over the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìFlensburg line. The line runs through flat, mostly agricultural land to Schleswig station, continuing through hilly moraines to Rendsburg. Train do not stop in B√ºdelsdorf, where there was a connection, until 1974, to the original line from Husum to Rendsburg via Erfde,which opened on 1 September 1910. Rendsburg station was not moved when the Kiel Canal was built. Instead the great Rendsburg Loop was built around part of the city to connect it to the Rendsburg High Bridge over the canal. The line branched from Osterr√∂nfeld station to Kiel until the line was diverted further east on 15 October 1904. In Felde, the line crosses the Eider river, which flows into the Kiel Canal nearby. The line reaches the Kiel‚ÄìFlensburg line and then the Hamburg-Altona‚ÄìKiel line just before the entrance to Kiel Hauptbahnhof. History =Husum-Erfde-Rendsburg  On 1 September 1910, a 50 km-long direct Husum‚ÄìErfde‚ÄìRendsburg line opened. It ran from Husum, crossed the lower Treene river to Norderstapel and ran via Erfde to Rendsburg and then continued on the current route to Kiel. The line crossed the Schleswig District Railway's line between Friedrichstadt and Schleswig in Norderstapel until 1934. In the late 1920s, there were continuous passenger services on the Husum‚ÄìErfde‚ÄìRendsburg‚ÄìKiel route, with a total running time of about three hours. A few faster services on the route took about two hours and 20 minutes. In 1959, motor coaches on the route to Rendsburg took about 70 minutes. Local trains on the Husum‚ÄìKiel route continued to operate via Erfde, while express trains were already running via J√ºbek. About eight pairs of trains operated daily. On 25 May 1974, passenger services were closed from Husum to Rendsburg via Erfde. At the same time the freight operations were discontinued on the section on the line between Erfde and Hohn. The line was dismantled afterwards. The continuous link was thus reduced to freight-only sections between Husum and Erfde and between Rendsburg and Hohn. These sections were further shortened in the following decades, piece by piece. One reason for the closures was the marshy ground in the middle part of the line. Since then, all trains from Husum to Kiel run via J√ºbek, Schleswig and Rendsburg, which means a detour of about 12 km. The route has now been largely dismantled. On 28 May 1988, freight transport between Fockbek and Hohn was closed. About 2.5 km long of the line between Rendsburg station and a northern industrial area remains, but it is also now unused. The Husum‚Äì Erfde line was closed to freight to Erfde on 24 September 1988, Schwabstedt on 27 May 1989 and to Mildstedt on 22 May 1993. It continued to operate as a siding to a timber mill in Mildstedt until 2003. Husum-J√ºbek  Most of this 26 km line was built as part of the Flensburg‚ÄìHusum‚ÄìT√∂nning line, completed by the Flensburg-Husum-T√∂nningen Railway Company (Flensburg-Husum-T√∂nninger Eisenbahngesellschaft, FHTE) on 25 October 1854, for, among other things, the transportation of cattle to Great Britain. The FHTE also opened on 25 October 1854 a line from Ohrstedt to Rendsburg via Owschlag, running to the west of the city of Schleswig. After the Second Schleswig War of 1864, the Duchy of Schleswig was annexed by Prussia and the northeastern section of the line from Husum to Flensburg was diverted to run from Sollbr√ºck (near Ohrstedt) to J√ºbek, rather than to Eggebek. This line was opened on 29 December 1869 and created a route between Husum and Neum√ºnster, which had the advantage of running via Schleswig and maximised the use of the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìFlensburg line. The old route from Ohrstedt to Owschlag was closed at the same time. J√ºbek‚ÄìRendsburg  This shares the middle part of the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìFlensburg line. Rendsburg‚ÄìKiel  Rendsburg station This section was opened on 15 October 1904 by the Prussian State Railways. Passenger services were mostly provided by local trains. Already in the late 1920s, some through trains ran to Husum, some of which made a few stops only. Later, three to four pairs of fast trains regularly ran on the route, including a pair of Husum‚ÄìL√ºbeck trains. After the closure of the Nieb√ºll-Flensburg line in 1980, a pair of trains run seasonally as the Sylter Welle from Kiel (sometimes also from L√ºbeck) to Westerland) via J√ºbek instead of Flensburg. This train ran in 2005 for the last time and was the last locomotive-hauled passenger train on the line. The newest station was opened between Rendsburg and Kiel at Mettenhof in the early 1970s to serve a satellite settlement of Kiel. In 1984 all stops between Rendsburg and Kiel were closed. In 1987, regional fast trains (Regionalschnellbahnen) were introduced on the line. Felde station (formerly Brandsbek) was re-opened for the start of the Nord-Ostsee-Bahn (NOB) service (now operated by Veolia Verkehr) in 2000. Current operations  Railcars of the previous operator, NOB, to Kiel in Husum station Passenger services over the whole Husum‚ÄìKiel route have been operated since December 2011 by Deutsche Bahn with Alstom Coradia LINT 41 railcars at hourly intervals. It replaced Nord-Ostsee-Bahn (NOB) as operator. Services over the 102 kilometre-long route take 81 or 83 minutes. Trains stop at J√ºbek, Schleswig, Owschlag, Rendsburg and Felde. Since January 2015, in addition to the hourly Regional-Express service, a Regionalbahn service runs hourly between Kiel and Rendsburg, which also stops in Kiel-Hassee CITTI-PARK, Kiel-Russee, Melsdorf, Achterwehr, Bredenbek and Sch√ºlldorf. These stations were reactivated with the exception of the new Kiel-Hassee CITTI-PARK station and the Bredenbek station which was relocated from Kronsburg. The dismantled second track from Kronsburg was rebuilt at the new station to increase the line's capacity. Only individual Regionalbahn services operate to Schleswig or Husum. The least frequented stations of Kiel-Russee and Achterwehr are request stops.

It was published in 1870 in his landmark flora of Australia, Flora Australiensis. It would stand for over a hundred years before being superseded by the 1978 arrangement of Ernest Charles Nelson. Background Adenanthos is a genus of around 30 species in the plant family Proteaceae. Endemic to southern Australia, they are evergreen woody shrubs with solitary flowers that are pollinated by birds and, if fertilised, develop into achenes. They are not much cultivated. Common names of species often include one of the terms woollybush, jugflower and stick-in-the-jug. The first known botanical collection of Adenanthos was made by Archibald Menzies during the September 1791 visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound on the south coast of Western Australia. However this did not lead to publication of the genus. Jacques Labillardi√®re collected specimens of A. cuneatus from Esperance Bay the following year, and in 1803 Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour collected the same two species as Menzies had 12 years earlier. Labillardi√®re published the genus in 1805, in his Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, based on the specimens collected by himself and Leschenault. The genus was given the name Adenanthos from the Greek Œ±Œ¥Œ∑ŒΩ (aden-, \\"gland\\") and Œ±ŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÉz (-anthos, \\"flower\\"), in reference to the prominent nectaries. By 1870, 13 species had been published. That year, Bentham published the fifth volume of his Flora Australiensis, in which was contained a treatment of the plant family Proteaceae, including Adenanthos. Bentham's arrangement In his treatment of Adenanthos, Bentham published a fourteenth species, and the first infrageneric arrangement: he divided the genus into two taxonomic sections, A. sect. Eurylaema and A. sect. Stenolaema, based on the shape of the perianth tube: members of A. sect. Eurylaema have perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle, whereas members of A. sect. Stenolaena have perianth tubes that are straight and unswollen. The full arrangement is as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema :::A. barbigera (now A. barbiger) :::A. obovata (now A. obovatus) ::A. sect. Stenolaena (now A. sect. Adenanthos) :::A. cuneata (now A. cuneatus) :::A. Cunninghamii (now A. √ó cunninghamii) :::A. pungens :::A. venosa (now A. venosus) :::A. Dobsoni (now A. dobsonii) :::A. linearis :::A. sericea (now A. sericeus) :::A. Meissneri (now A. meisneri) :::A. filifolia (now A. filifolius) :::A. terminalis :::A. flavidiflora (now A. flavidiflorus) :::A. apiculata (now A. apiculatus) Legacy Bentham's arrangement stood for over a hundred years, by which time a number of new species had been discovered, rendering Bentham's treatment \\"very inadequate and incomplete\\". His division of the genus into two sections based on perianth shape is still accepted today, but changes in the laws of botanical nomenclature mean that A. sect. Stenolaema is now known as A. sect. Adenanthos, and all specific epithets now have masculine gender; for example, the species that Bentham referred to as Adenanthos barbigera is now named Adenanthos barbiger.

The university named after Jenderal Soedirman (English: General Sudirman), the first commander-in-chief of the Indonesian Army during the country's fight for independence; he was born in the Banyumas region. UNSOED is the only public university in the ex-Banyumas residency. Thus affecting the student composition, from 25,782 of total active students in 2008, students from local Banyumas region accounted for almost 35% while the rest are from other regions in Indonesia as far as Sumatera and Sulawesi. About 5000 students enrolled at the university every year. To improve services for the students, UNSOED provided facilities and activities such as a students economic union (KOPMA), scholarships, medical services and medical infrastructure, life insurance, libraries, laboratory, student learning center, student activity center, web-based academic information system, academic infrastructure (campuses, auditorium, rectorate and administration center), arts and sports organizations and dormitory. History Main building of UNSOED. Depict a statue of General Sudirman riding a horse. In the 1960s, the highest education facilities in Banyumas residency was senior high schools, includes general and vocational schools. Meanwhile, local Banyumas society became more interested in higher education; the lack of higher education institutions in the region meant that fresh high school graduates went outside the region if they wanted to get a degree. Hampered by the high cost of living outside the region, only students from wealthy families could afford it. This sparked the idea to establish a university in the region. The first step was the creation of agriculture faculty establishment board on February 10, 1961, followed by the establishment of Jenderal Soedirman University foundation on November 20, 1961. The faculty of agriculture was the first faculty -- established on September 20, 1962 under cooperation with Diponegoro University. The faculty of agriculture was the precursor to establish Jenderal Soedirman University with more faculty and administration systems. On November 27, 1963 a ceremony was held in a Banyumas residential house to formally established the Jenderal Soedirman University. The official launching was conducted by the Minister of PTIP, Dr. Tojib Hadiwidjaja. This establishment was possible with aid from other institutions such as universities (UGM, UNPAD and UNDIP), PTIP Department (now DIKTI), provincial government of Central Java and leaders of the Indonesian armed forces. When established, UNSOED had three faculties: Agriculture, Economics and Biology. Now it has eight faculties and postgraduate programmes, comprising 31 undergraduate programmes (Strata 1/S1), nine master's degree programmes (Strata 2/S2) and 11 three-year diploma programs (D3).http://www.unsoed.ac.id  Academics = Undergraduate and Diploma Programmes { valign=\\"top\\" Science *Faculty of Agriculture (Faperta) ** S1 Agrotechnology ** S1 Agribusiness ** S1 Agricultural Engineering ** S1 Food Science and Technology ** D3 Agrobusiness ** D3 Soil Science *Faculty of Biology (Fabio) ** S1 Biology ** D3 Fishery Resource Management *Faculty of Animal Husbandry (Fapet) ** S1 Animal Husbandry ** D3 Poultry Production *Faculty of Medicine (FK) ** S1 Medical Education ** S1 Dentistry *Faculty of Engineering (FT) ** S1 Informatics Engineering ** S1 Civil Engineering ** S1 Electrical Engineering ** S1 Geological Engineering ** S1 Industrial Engineering *Faculty of Health Sciences (Fikes) ** S1 Public Health ** S1 Nursing ** S1 Pharmacy ** S1 Nutrition **D3 Physical Education, Sport, Health, and Recreation *Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) ** S1 Chemistry ** S1 Mathematics ** S1 Physics *Faculty of Fishery and Marine Sciences (FPIK) ** S1 Aquatic Resources Management ** S1 Aquatic Culture ** S1 Oceanology width=\\"50\\" valign=\\"top\\" Non-science *Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) ** S1 Economic Development ** S1 Management **S1 Accounting **S1 Economic Education **D3 Financial Administration ** D3 Accounting ** D3 Secretariat ** D3 International Business *Faculty of Law (FH) ** S1 Law Science *Faculty of Social and Political Science (FISIP) ** S1 Sociology ** S1 Public Administration ** S1 Communication Science ** S1 Political Science ** S1 International Relations *Faculty of Humanity (FIB) ** S1 Indonesian Literature ** S1 English Literature **S1 Japanese Literature **S1 Indonesian Language Education **S1 English Language Education ** D3 English Literature ** D3 Chinese Literature }  Postgraduate programmes  * Master course ** Accounting ** Management ** Public Administration ** Economics ** Law ** Biology ** Environmental Science ** Crop Science ** Animal Resources * Doctoral course ** Biology ** Management Admission Admission to UNSOED is conducted through nationwide entrance examinations.

It started operating in 1996. The amount of traffic processed by the JINX has been steadily growing, and growth has been exponential in the second half of the 2000s (decade), with, for example, 450 Mbps peak-hour load in 2008 that almost doubled to 800 Mbit/s in early 2010. JINX stats In part the growth can be attributed to the open peering policy adopted by some of the larger participants, like TENET and MWEB and the large content base that is available from provider like Internet Solutions. When using JINX figures to extrapolate Internet usage stats in South Africa, bear in mind that a significant amount of traffic does not go through the public switch fabric, but is changed over private peering sessions. Most major South African Internet Service Providers have chosen to peer via JINX: some examples are Internet Solutions, Neotel, TENET, iBurst, Vox Telecom and MWEB. Real time traffic statistics are available on the JINX Traffic Graphs. In 2009, the ISPA restarted the exchange point in Cape Town, CINX, to complement JINX, and in September 2012, an exchange point in Durban, (DINX), was started. The IP address block for JINX is 196.223.14.X/24, and 2001:43f8:1f0::/48.Johannesburg Internet Exchange information In 2012, the ISPA appointed Nishal Goburdhan as the full-time manager of the Internet Exchange points in South Africa. Governance structure of JINX As a peering point the JINX is open to any network that is able to peer. Initially, the JINX was only available to ISPA members, but in 2008 a resolution was passed to allow non-ISPA members to connect to the JINX. As at Sep 2016, the three Internet exchange points mentioned above are all managed through a community elected set of representatives that act in the best of interests of the IXP. While voting is limited to IXP participants, eligibility to be on the management committee is open to any natural person, and not just IXP participants. Working groups, like the INX-wg exist for the participants to discuss matters of concern and interest, and to generate feedback to the INX management committee. Proposals and suggestions are thus generated at the INX-wg level, and voted on within the INX management committee. Milestones In 2016, JINX became the multisite, extending beyond its initial base of operations to additional locations within the metropolitan area.

Life  Abdallah was born ca. 677 and grew up in the Caliphate's capital, Damascus. He was a son of Caliph Abd al-Malik and one of the latter's (concubines). During his youth he accompanied his father on several campaigns. He led his own campaign for the first time in 700/1, as a retaliation for the attacks of the Byzantine general Heraclius. During this expedition he captured the border fortress of Theodosiopolis and raided into Armenia Minor. In 701 he was sent, along with his uncle, Muhammad ibn Marwan, to Iraq, to aid al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf in subduing the rebellion of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath. In the next year, the Byzantine Armenian provinces east of the Euphrates, recently conquered by Muhammad ibn Marwan, rose in a revolt that spread out over much of Armenia. In 703, Abdallah conquered Mopsuestia in Cilicia, which he refortified as the Caliphate's first major stronghold in the area, and then proceeded to subdue the Armenian revolt along with his uncle Muhammad. His father also appointed him as governor of Jund Hims, according to Khalifah ibn Khayyat, although al-Baladhuri claims that this was done by al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715). In late 704 however he was recalled from Armenia to serve as governor of Egypt, succeeding his long-serving uncle Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan. Abdallah's tenure was marked by his efforts to assert the caliphal government's control over the province after Abd al-Aziz's twenty-year tenure, which had made the province virtually his personal fief. This was done at the expense of the local elites, whom Abd al-Aziz had been careful to co-opt: Abdallah dismissed his uncle's appointees and required that government business be done in Arabic instead of Coptic. His tenure was marred by the first famine under Islamic rule and by accusations of corruption and embezzlement of public funds. He was recalled in 708/9 and his gains were confiscated by the Caliph. Nothing is known of him thereafter, except for a report in al-Ya'qubi that he was executed by crucifixion by the first Abbasid Caliph, al-Saffah, at al-Hira in 749/50.

History =Founding and early years The Palacio de la Magdalena. Men√©ndez Pelayo International University was created in 1932 by decree of the Second Spanish Republic, following a proposal by the Minister of Public Instruction, Fernando de los R√≠os, under the name \\"International Summer University of Santander\\". Its headquarters were established at the Palacio de la Magdalena, which had been a summer residence for King Alfonso XIII from 1913 to 1930. The palace had originally been donated to the king by the Santander City Council. It first Rectors were the historian and philologist Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal and the eminent physicist Blas Cabrera Felipe. The same decree named poet and professor Pedro Salinas as Secretary General to recognize his role in providing inspiration for the new University. During the summers from 1933 to 1936, many courses were developed, with an emphasis on Spanish language and literature. These courses were designed for foreigners who, since 1926, had been receiving instruction at the Men√©ndez Pelayo Society; and for postgraduates of the Medical Institute whose classes had formerly been located at the Marqu√©s de Valdecilla University Hospital. Post-war re-establishment These activities were interrupted by the Spanish Civil War and were not resumed until 1945, following the approval of an order that created the Men√©ndez Pelayo International University with headquarters in the Hospital of San Rafael in Santander. At the beginning of summer in 1949, the University returned to its former home in the Palacio de la Magdalena, courtesy of a grant from Don Juan de Borb√≥n. Soon, given the increase in activity at the University, it became necessary to establish a campus at the Parque Atl√°ntico de Las Llamas, also in Santander, with residential units as well as classrooms. Years of growth Since 1983, UIMP has extended its activities to seven other cities and has introduced shorter (often self-contained) courses. Its stated objective is to satisfy two requirements that are equally desirable and indispensable to the formation of modern culture: attention to the universal human needs that must present themselves to every sensitive mind; and the skill to clarify carefully defined technical problems in a way that represents a positive advance in each discipline. Every year, the University has expanded it courses to reflect new developments in the social sciences and humanities, as well as technology, and has extended its cultural activities to include music, theater, poetry and the cinema.

The museum documents the history of Woodhall Spa's development as a 19th-century spa town designed by Richard Adolphus Came. History The museum was inaugurated in 1987 and consists of a bungalow constructed of corrugated galvanised iron laid on a timber frame.Heritage Lottery Fund, www.hlf.org.uk -accessed 18.11.2010. The building was shipped to Woodhall Spa as a flat pack.http://www.woodhallspa.org/wp/31-2/heritage/cottage-museum The cottage, erected in 1887, was chosen from the models available in the catalogue of Boulton & Paul Ltd, a leading manufacturer of corrugated iron buildings, which where having a bit of a vogue in the era. It is an unusual example of such a cottage that is still standing in well-preserved condition. The cottage was built by John and Mary Wield, employees of Woodhull Spa. The Wields were in the business of providing rides in Bath chairs drawn by donkeys to carry visitors between the spa's health baths and hotels. John Wield created a photographic record of the then new Victorian spa community at Woodhall Spa. Today, his photographic collection forms the basis of the Woodhall Spa Cottage Museum collection. The bungalow was the home of the Wield family from 1887 to the 1960s.Museum Website, www.woodhallspa-museum.co.uk -accessed 18.11.2010. John Wield's collection of photographs and ephemera was offered in the early 1980s to the community of Woodhall Spa provided it was put on public display. Not long after that, in 1985, John Wield's bungalow came on the market and, in 1986, a trust was formed to set up the Woodhall Spa Cottage Museum. The local tourist information centre is housed within the museum.East Lindsey District Council, www.e-lindsey.gov.uk -accessed 18.11.2010. In 2011, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a grant of ¬£677,600 to be used to refurbish the building, update the exhibits, and fund programs.

James John Wilson Carmichael (9 June 1800 ‚Äì 1868), also known as John Carmichael was a British marine painter. Life Carmichael was born at the Ouseburn, in Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, on 9 June 1800, the son of William Carmichael, a ship's carpenter. He went to sea at an early age, and spent three years on board a vessel sailing between ports in Spain and Portugal. On his return, he was apprenticed to a shipbuilding firm.http://www.thejournal.co.uk/north-east-analysis/analysis-news/fine-art- featuring-storm-tossed-7943251 After completing his apprenticeship, he devoted all his spare time to art, and eventually gave up the carpentry business, setting himself up as a drawing-master and miniature painter. His first historical painting to attract public notice was the Fight Between the Shannon and Chesapeake, which sold for 13 guineas (¬£13.65). He then painted The Bombardment of Algiers for Trinity House, Newcastle, for which he received 40 guineas; it is still at Trinity House, along with The Heroic Exploits of Admiral Lord Collingwood in HMS \\"Excellent\\" at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, painted in collaboration with George Balmer. Another important early commission was for a View of Newcastle for which the city corporation paid him 100 guineas. During the redevelopment of the centre of Newcastle, Carmichael worked with the architect John Dobson to produce some joint works, including paintings with designs for the Central Station and the Grainger Market. He also collaborated with John Blackmore to produce an illustrated book: 'Views on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway' in 1836. His name first appears as an exhibitor in 1838, when he contributed an oil painting, Shipping in the Bay of Naples, to the Society of British Artists. He showed both oil paintings and watercolours at the Royal Academy, his contributions including The Conqueror towing the Africa off the Shoals of Trafalgar (1841) and The Arrival of the Royal Squadron (1843). He lived in Newcastle until about 1845, when he moved to London, where he was already known as a skilful marine painter. In 1855, during the Crimean War he was sent to the Baltic to make drawings for The Illustrated London News. His painting of the bombardment of Sveaborg, which he witnessed during this assignment, was exhibited at the Royal Academy and is now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum. He later moved to Scarborough, where he died in 1868. He published The Art of Marine Painting in Water-Colours in 1859, and The Art of Marine Painting in Oil-Colours in 1864.http://spartacus-educational.com/Jcarmichael.htm His daughter Annie married William Luson Thomas son of a shipbroker and a successful artist who, exasperated by the treatment of artists by the Illustrated London News, founded in 1869 The Graphic newspaper which had immense influence within the art world.

Uruguayan officials talking at a meeting at the Palacio Taranco, November 6, 2010 Palacio Taranco, located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of the Old City of Montevideo, Uruguay, is a palace erected in the early 20th century during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. It was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules Chifflot Le√≥n, who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. This building contains European furniture and drapings and currently contains the Museum of Decorative Arts in Montevideo. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government. The palace was erected on the site of Montevideo's first theatre in the historical centre of the city which had been built in 1793. The Taranco Ortiz family commissioned the construction of the building in 1907 and it was completed in 1910. In 1943 the Uruguayan state purchased the residence and part of the furniture and gained access to its works of art, but it wasn't until 1972 that it became a museum, and it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975. The Museum of Decorative Arts contains various paintings, sculptures, textiles, ornaments, and European furniture. On the ground floor and first floor of the building can be found some of the furniture of Louis XV and Louis XVI finely inlaid; the works of Ribera (1591‚Äì1652), Teniers (1610‚Äì1690), Mierevelt (1567‚Äì1641), Van der Helst (1613‚Äì1670), Appiani (1754‚Äì1817), Pradilla (1846‚Äì1921), Zuloaga (1870‚Äì1945), and Sorolla (1863‚Äì1923); Benlliure sculptures (1862‚Äì1947), Bouchard (1875‚Äì1969), Landowski (1875‚Äì1961), Vermare (1899‚Äì1919) etc. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of Classical Art and Archaeology in the basement, consisting of artifacts of ceramics, glass, and bronzes and various items related to Greco-Roman and Near East art and archaeology.

Spines, or tubercles, are typically found in two rows on the inner and outer parts of the whorl sides, joined by radial ribs. These are often more developed on the inner and middle whorls, becoming less so or absent on the outer. Sutures are highly complex. The Eoderoceratidae can be divided into two subfamilies, the Xiphoceratinae which is the earliest and in which there is an early maximum development of spines of the inner whorls, and the Eoderoceratinae. Two other subfamilies were included in the Treatise 1957 but are now regarded as families in their own right, These are the Phricodoceratidae and Coeloceratidae Genera that have been attributed to the Xiphoceratinae are Bifericeras, Microderoceras, and Xiphoceras.

The social liberalism of liberal Anglo-Catholics can be seen in an association with Christian socialism. With regard to Christian socialism, Frederick Denison Maurice in 1849 said, \\"I seriously believe that Christianity is the only foundation of Socialism, and that a true Socialism is the necessary result of a sound Christianity.\\". Quoted in . Generally, liberal Anglo-Catholics will be social justice‚Äìminded. Jonathan Daniels, a seminarian of the Episcopal Church in the United States who died during the civil rights movement, is a modern martyr for liberal Anglo-Catholics. Liberal Anglo- Catholics allow modern knowledge and research to inform their use of reason. Science and religion, for instance, are held to be legitimate and different methodologies of revealing God's truth. This also directly affects the liberal Anglo-Catholic's reading of scripture, ecclesiastical history, and general methodology of theology. A metaphor is that theology for liberal Anglo- Catholics is a \\"dance\\" that allows people to slowly grow in an understanding of God.

Unbundling When initially created in the 1980s, ESCOM monopolised the functions of (a) generation (b)transmission and (c) distribution of electric power throughout Malawi. In 2015, the government of Malawi began planning the unbundling of the company to allow private investors to enter the Malawian market. Escom is saddled with low tariffs and payment arrears. The company is heavily indebted and is loss-making. It lacks creditworthiness and is unable to attract private investment into the electricity sector, because power- purchase agreements with Escom are not financially viable. It is unable to upgrade infrastructure and increase generation capacity. In January 2017, Escom was split into two companies. Electricity Generation Company Malawi Limited (Egenco) is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and improvement of the power stations owned by the Malawian government. At that time the power stations had generation capacity of 351 megawatts. Escom retained the role of bulk-purchaser, transmission and distribution to the consumer.

This particular species is known by the common names thinleaf huckleberry, tall huckleberry, big huckleberry, mountain huckleberry, square-twig blueberry, and (ambiguously) as \\"black huckleberry\\". Distribution  Vaccinium membranaceum is native to western North America, with a range extending in the northern from southern Alaska, Yukon, and Northwest Territories south as far as Utah and the northern mountains of California. It can be found from the mountains next to the Pacific Ocean in the west, to the Rocky Mountains and Black Hills in the east.Biota of North America Program 2014 state-level distribution map Isolated populations of this species have been found in Arizona, North Dakota, Minnesota, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and Ontario.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map Vaccinium membranaceum grows at higher elevations in subalpine and alpine environments. It occurs in both pine and spruce dominated forests and in open meadow ecosystems. In forests V. membranaceum often dominates the forest understory during early to mid stages of succession.US Forest Service Fire Ecology Vaccinium membranceum is fire adapted. The leaves and stems of the huckleberry are resistant to low-intensity fires, and if burned away they will resprout vigorously from rhizomes buried under the soil. Description Vaccinium membranaceum is an erect shrub growing up to in maximum height. The new twigs are yellow-green and somewhat angled. The deciduous leaves are alternately arranged. The very thin to membranous, oval leaf blades are up to 5 centimeters (2 inches) long. The edges are serrated, with each tiny tooth tipped with a glandular hair. Solitary flowers occur in the leaf axils. Each is around 6 millimeters (1/4 inch) long, urn-shaped to cylindrical, and pale pink to waxy bronze in color. They are pollinated by bees. The mature fruit ranges from red through bluish-purple to a dark, almost black berry about a centimeter wide. Each fruit contains an average of 47 tiny seeds. ;Reproduction The plant rarely reproduces via seed, rather, it usually spreads by cloning itself from its rhizome or shoots. The seeds do germinate if dispersed by animals, however, as evidenced by populations of the plant growing on the recovering section of Mount St. Helens.Yang, S., et al. (2008). Colonization genetics of an animal-dispersed plant (Vaccinium membranaceum) at Mount St Helens, Washington. Molecular Genetics 17:3 731-40. Other than the study by Yang et al. (2008) reports of V. membranaceum sprouting from seed are quite rare with other scientists who have studied this species reporting only 6 seedlings observed during 18 years in the field.  Uses  Vaccinium membranaceum is the species that is the most commonly collected of all of the wild western huckleberries, and it has great commercial importance.Flora of North America, Vaccinium membranaceum Douglas ex Torrey, 1874. Thinleaf huckleberry In a good year Vaccinium membranaceum shrubs produce a lot of fruit. The amount of fruit produced by these shrubs is legendary, with stories being told of mountain sides turned purple by all of the fruit, or shrubs being weighed to the ground by large, and abundant berries Native Americans Both humans and wildlife enjoy feasting on this fruit in the late summer and early fall. People have been eating the fruit of this species for thousands of years. It was and continues to be widely used for food by Native Americans. The Kutenai called the black huckleberry shaw√≠ash (Ktunaxa: «Çawiya«Ç). Alaska Natives consumed it in bread and pies as a source of vitamin C, the Coeur d'Alene people ate the fruit fresh, dried, mashed, cooked, and added it to soup or froze it for later use, and many other groups relished it and stored it frozen, dried, pressed into cakes, or canned for winter use.Ethnobotany, University of Michigan Wildlife The plant also provides a key food source for black and grizzly bears, which eat the leaves, stems, roots, and fruit. Elk, moose, and white-tailed deer also browse the plant. The thickets provide cover for many species of small animals. Symbol The huckleberry is the official state fruit of Idaho, with this particular species assumed to be the huckleberry in question.Netstate: Idaho State Fruit  Management  Some Native American groups lit carefully planned controlled burns in wild huckleberry patches to promote fruit production by eliminating competing plants and by stimulating the huckleberry to sprout and spread. Native American groups throughout the Pacific Northwest still utilize this plant as an important cultural food and are active in its management.Martin, L. P., et al. (2008).

History Kura was formulated (as Response) in 1991 and is headquartered in Glasgow. The company were part of Murray International Holdings Ltd and owned by Sir David Murray until late 2014. Founded under Murray after the publication of the Taylor Report into safety at football grounds. One of the outcomes of the report required tickets to be sold prior to games. This spurred on many clubs to open call centres to deal with ticket sales and stadium seating arrangements. Murray, the chairman of Rangers at the time, set up the company to deal with these enquiries. Under Murray they acquired the contact centre operations of Thus for ¬£4m in 2004 and a specialist business process software company called Carnegie Information Systems in 2005. Trading under the RHL (Response Handling Ltd) name until in February 2007 it was shortened to Response. In June 2008 they also acquired a local software company known as Inisoft, meaning the company offer in-house software capability to potential clients. In early 2014, trade reports stated that Response and its associated companies were for sale as Murray's parent company was under financial pressure. There had been no real interest from the contact centre community with regards to purchasing the company. In late August 2014, the company was sold.

They sent an undercover reporter into the company and gathered customers' information including bank details. The BBC approached Response with their findings and they subsequently took the BBC to court in an effort to stop the programme being broadcast. A judge ruled in favour of the BBC and the show was broadcast. In 2008, a Muslim man won ¬£20,000, after accusing Response of mistreating Irish and minority staff. He claimed staff frequently mocked Irish callers, and persistently made racist comments towards callers from the Student Loans Company. He was granted ¬£15,000 for injury to his feelings, a further ¬£3,750 because the company did not follow the statutory grievance procedure, and an additional ¬£3,718 in interest. The Student Loans Company also had to reimburse two students after their student loans were never received. Another staff member was responsible for this and subsequently left the company.

Spence was born on 10 March 1942 in Hamilton, Ontario. He received a B.A. degree from McMaster University, Hamilton in 1964 and a L.Th. from Wycliffe College, Toronto in 1968. He was ordained a deacon on 5 May 1968 and then a priest on 1 December 1968Crockford's Clerical Directory 1975-76 London: Oxford University Press, 1976 by Bishop Walter Bagnall. Spence was an assistant curate at St. George‚Äôs Guelph (1968-1970) and then the rector of St. Bartholomew's Hamilton (1970 -1974). After further incumbencies at St. John's Thorold (1975-1982) and St. Luke‚Äôs Burlington (1982-1997) he became the Archdeacon of Trafalgar in 1992 until his consecration to the episcopate as Bishop of Niagara on 21 September 1997 at Christ's Church Cathedral. He was installed at that same cathedral as the tenth Bishop of Niagara on 11 January 1998 and he retired on 29 February 2008. In 2008, Spence became the Chancellor of Renison University College, Waterloo, serving until 2016. Heraldry & Vexillology Since his youth, Spence has had a passion for flags (or vexillology) and heraldry. He has designed numerous personal coats of arms (including his own), coats of arms for churches in the Diocese of Niagara as well as for communities and organizations in Ontario. In 1981, he became a Fellow of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada. For his contributions to Canadian heraldry, in 2006 he was appointed Herald Extraordinary with the Canadian Heraldic Authority and in 2007 he was given the title \\"Albion Herald Extraordinary\\" by the Governor General of Canada. An avid collector of flags, Spence's collection once sat at approximately 3000 items, including a variety of historical Canadian flags as well as flags gifted to him by Queen Elizabeth II. Most of his collection has now been donated to the Canadian Heraldic Authority at Rideau Hall to remain forever a part of the Canadian treasure. A large part of his collection has been gifted to the Canadian Flag Collection, a permanent exhibit housed at Settlers, Rails & Trails Inc., Argyle, Manitoba. Over 250 flags were donated to the museum in Argyle and arrived on National Flag of Canada Day, February 15, 2018. Bishop Spence has been involved in the design of a variety of coats of arms and flags for individuals, municipalities, and institutions, including: *The City of Hamilton, Ontario *Redeemer University College *The Royal Canadian Military Institute *The Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake *Bishop Michael Bird *Renison University College File:Flag_of_Hamilton.svgFlag of the City of Hamilton, Ontario designed by D. Ralph Spence File:Flag of Burlington, ON.pngFlag of the City of Burlington, Ontario designed by D. Ralph Spence Renison University College In 2008, Spence was invested as Chancellor of Renison University College at St. George's of Forest Hill Anglican Church in Kitchener, Ontario. At his investiture, Bishop Spence and his wife, Carol, donated to the college a ceremonial mace for use at the college's convocation ceremony and other official events. Renison‚Äôs mace is made of local wood from the Waterloo area and fashioned by local artisans. It follows the shape of most maces with a crown, a bowl, and a wooden shaft. The Mace is to be carried by an honoured member of the College in front of the Chancellor at Convocations and special ceremonies. The crown is carved with maple leaves and trilliums, reflecting the institution of the Crown in Canada and Ontario. The bowl has three coats of arms; Renison University College, University of Waterloo, and the personal arms of Bishop Spence. Carved moose heads, derived from the crest of the coat of arms, support the bowl. Down the shaft of the mace is the small coat of arms belonging to The Rev. Canon David Bowyer, Honorary Senior Fellow of Renison and painter of the arms located on the mace. Spence later donated two processional staves, to be carried by students of the college, to lead academic processions. Each stave bears Renison's shield and badge of the college surmounted by a crown of maple leaves and trilliums. They represent the two halves of Renison's student body: the residents and the academic students. In 2014, Renison University College applied for and was granted supporters for its coat of arms by the Canadian Heraldic Authority. Spence, Albion Herald Extraordinary, was a lead designer for this grant. At the end of his two terms as Chancellor of Renison University College, Spence was made Chancellor Emeritus of the College in 2016, in recognition of his outstanding support of and leadership to the college. This is an honour only granted to two previous chancellors of Renison.

It was released in 1974 with a foreword by the aviator Charles Lindbergh. The book was re-released in 2009 to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the first crewed lunar landing, and again for its 50th anniversary, in 2019. The book covers Collins's life as a test pilot in the United States Air Force; his selection as an astronaut and his spacewalks on Gemini 10 and historic flight as the Command Module pilot on Apollo 11. Collins presents some candid insights into his astronaut colleagues, including Neil Armstrong (\\"I can't offhand think of a better choice to be the first man on the moon\\") and Buzz Aldrin (\\"would make a champion chess player; always thinks several moves ahead\\"). Background Collins was originally going to title the book World in my Window, but he later decided that was \\"too corny\\". After discussing it with his editor, they decided to use three words to describe spaceflight. Collins decided on Carrying the Fire. In the book, Collins discusses the selection of the first person to walk on the Moon, and the resulting tension that arises from it. Reception In his review for TIME magazine, Robert Sherrod calls it \\"the best-written book yet by any of the astronauts\\". As an author, Collins works without assistance from ghost writers, stating that \\"No matter how good the ghost, I am convinced that a book loses realism when an interpreter stands between the storyteller and his audience\\".

They permitted their bearers to execute summary justice (including capital punishment) on thieves within the borders of their own manors or fiefs.. The terms are frequently attested in royal writs and charters using formulas such as \\"sake and soke, toll and team, and infangthief\\", which specified the usual rights accompanying grants of land. Scope Infangthief (,. . \\"thief seized within\\") applied to thieves captured within a landowner's estate, although it sometimes permitted them to be chased in other jurisdictions and brought back for trial. Under the 13th-century \\"laws of Edward the Confessor\\", the privilege was restricted to the lord's \\"own thief\\"‚Äîthat is, the lord's serfs and staff. According to Bracton, the privilege was further restricted to those caught in flagrante delicto or in possession of the stolen object.. Outfangthief (,. . \\"thief seized without\\") is a more problematic term, as it is unattested prior to a forged charter included in the 3rd edition of William of Malmesbury's Deeds of the English Kings ().. It seems to have initially been understood as the right to try a thief among the lord's own men wheresoever he might be apprehended,The New England Historical & Genealogical Register and Antiquarian Journal, vol. 16, p. 257. New England Historic Genealogical Society, 1857 but this understanding is explicitly rejected by Bracton's Laws and Customs of England and the Fleta, which instead give it the meaning of permitting thieves captured on the lord's land to be tried by his court regardless of the thief's own origin. The Fleta further states that the lord had the right to hang thieves from among his own men on his own gallows, once they had been condemned by the jurisdiction where they had been captured. The thief's captor was given a choice between summarily executing him‚Äîthe usual fate for the poor‚Äîor \\"amercing\\" him, ransoming him for a fine set according to his rank.Wright, Martin. Justice for victims and offenders: a restorative response to crime, p. 13. Waterside Press, 1996. Such privileges had several advantages: they were profitable, helped to maintain discipline on the estate, and identified the privilege- holder as a figure of authority. They remained in use after the Norman Conquest as a standard right given to local lords and did not finally fall into disuse until the time of Edward III. Even then, they continued to be asserted for a considerable time afterwards in Halifax, West Yorkshire. Examples According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in 963 AD King Edgar granted a charter to Bishop √Üthelwold for the minster of Medeshamstede (afterwards Peterborough) and attached villages. The charter included the grant of \\"sack and sock, toll and team, and infangthief\\".

The Enzmann starship is a concept for a manned interstellar spacecraft proposed in 1964 by Dr. Robert Enzmann. A three million ton ball of frozen deuterium would fuel nuclear fusion rocket engines contained in a cylindrical section behind that ball with the crew quarters. The craft would be about long overall.  Design  The ball of frozen deuterium would fuel thermonuclear-powered pulse propulsion units, similar to Project Orion engines. The spacecraft would be assembled in Earth orbit as part of a larger project preceded by interstellar probes and telescopic observation of target star systems. The rest of the spacecraft would be attached behind the ball as a seamless metallic fuel tank. The proposed method of tank construction would be to expand a plastic balloon in space and coat it with metal. The spacecraft would be modular, and the main living area would be three identical wide and long cylindrical modules. The Enzmann could function as an interstellar ark, supporting a crew of 200 but with space for expansion. The Enzmann starship was detailed in the October 1973 issue of Analog, with a cover by space artist Rick Sternbach.ISFDB Publication Listing: Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, October 1973 The spacecraft described in that issue had some differences compared to the 1960s proposal, such as using a 12,000,000 ton (11,000,000 tonnes) ball of frozen deuterium. Enzmanns have been depicted by many space artists including Don Dixon, David A. Hardy, Syd Mead, Bob Eggleton, and Rick Sternbach. Sources conflict about the projected speed, perhaps 30% of the speed of light, c, but 9% may be more likely. At 30%, relativistic effects between people on Earth and on the spacecraft, such as time dilation would become more noticeable, such as the shipboard time being less than the Earth observed time. Overall specifications have varied somewhat, but the design has nuclear pulse engines at the rear, then cylinders for human habitation, then closer the front a large ball of fuel. Early versions were said to have 8 engines and later 24 nuclear rocket engines, which would be powered by the fusing of deuterium into helium-3. A common feature was that the crew area was replicated 3 times for redundancy, and a common core pillar ran the length of the spacecraft and through the center of each habitation unit.

When the larva consumes the parenchymal tissue within the blotchy part, it leaves the mine for a pupating site through a semicircular slit. The cocoon is small, boat-shaped, with some bubbles on the surface. The full-grown larva is reddish in body colour.
