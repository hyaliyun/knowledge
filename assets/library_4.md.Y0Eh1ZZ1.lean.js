History= World War II  Forces from the Reserve were assigned by the Stavka (Supreme High Command) to individual fronts (army groups) that were conducting major operations. These formations were designed to support any forms of operations but especially penetrations and exploitations in accordance with the Soviet deep battle doctrine. Beginning in 1943, the formations and units in the Reserve ranged from battalions to whole armies (e.g. the Reserve Armies), with an emphasis on artillery and mechanised formations, and were capable of large-scale, independent operations. For example, as of April 1943, an artillery penetration corps contained as many as 1,500 gun tubes and rocket launchers each. Tank armies, which also emerged in 1943, included one or two tank corps and one mechanised corps, plus supporting units. These mechanised formations were capable of conducting operational exploitations of up to 500 kilometers. Modern period In modern Russia, the only reserve of the Supreme Commander is the Airborne Forces. Most of the military units of the Airborne Forces, which are part of the Reserve of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, are also guards. With reference to the Russian airborne troops, as the reserve of the Supreme Commander, officially used two largely equivalent term: reserves and fund - the latter reflects an instrumental status of forces among a set of other measures of military and non-military nature for the implementation of state power at the disposal of the supreme leader of the country. The airborne troops have always been the reserve of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The most important, but not the only factor that makes the Airborne being a reserve force of the Supreme Commander, is their mobility - to ensure the defense of the territory of such a large scale country as Russia, is only possible with the use of airborne compounds, which at any time could be parachuted to any theater of operations. To accomplish this task, the Airborne Forces are the most suitable, which de facto fulfill the function of rapid reaction forces.

In this episode, Emma must find a way to escape the Wish realm as she tries to convince Regina that Robin Hood is part of the universe, while David takes matters into his own hands when Gideon arrives, thus making matters disturbing for Gold and Belle. Plot=Opening sequence A enchanted tree from the Wish realm is featured in the forest. Event chronology The Land Without Magic flashbacks take place during winter 1990, one year after the flashback of \\"The Dark Swan\\", and a few years before \\"Snow Drifts\\". The Dark Realm flashbacks take place many years after the Black Fairy kidnapped Gideon in \\"Wish You Were Here\\".According to Mr. Gold, in the Dark Realm the time runs differently, where nothing makes sense, and where anything is possible. The Wish Realm and Storybrooke events take place after \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" The events during the Wish Realm in this episode would result in the events that would later take place in \\"Homecoming.\\" In the Characters' Past In winter 1990 Minnesota, a young Emma has run away from a group home and is living on the streets of Minneapolis. While she is tearing pages out of a fairy tale book to keep her warm, a teenage boy approaches her and stops Emma from tearing the pages. He then shows her a story from the book - The Golden Age Compendium of Children's Fairy Tales - \\"The Ugly Duckling\\", to tell her that out of the bad things that she sees around her that great things will come her way. Emma agrees to return to the group home, and tells the woman who took her in that her last name was Swan. In the Wish Realm After they miss the opportunity to escape back to Storybrooke, Emma and Regina are forced to hand over their items to Robin, whom Regina believes is real although Emma says otherwise. When they hear horses coming, Robin escapes but Emma and Regina are now hiding from Prince Henry, who believes Regina is still the Evil Queen. Afterwards, Emma comes across Pinocchio, and after explaining that they're from another realm, they come up with a plan to build a magical portal called \\"magical wardrobe\\" so they can return home. Regina, on the other hand, decides to find out about the Wish realm Robin, and she tracks him down to his tavern. While there, she asks Robin if he would‚Äôve been better off if she had never pursued him, only to have their conversation be interrupted by the Sheriff of Nottingham, who places them in jail. Regina discovers that Marian in this realm has died and Robin is unhappy; in this realm, Robin is a wanted thief as he keeps everything he steals instead of giving it to the poor. Suddenly the Wish realm Rumplestiltskin arrives and frees them, but instead of Rumplestiltskin returning the favor for freeing her after she did the same for him, Regina finds herself in Rumplestiltskin's custody, because in this realm she had Belle killed. Regina tells Robin that where she comes from the real Robin was murdered. Robin agrees to help Regina escape and they do. Meanwhile, Emma and Pinocchio start working on the ingredients needed to create the portal, when they come across a Wish realm version of Hook, except this one is an alcoholic and wants to start fights. As Emma uses her magic to send him back to his ship, Hook accidentally breaks one of Pinocchio‚Äôs magical tools. Pinocchio gives Emma a present, which turns out to be a wooden figure of a swan, similar to the one Emma saw in ‚ÄúThe Ugly Duckling\\" in the flashback, and she learns that he is the teenager who convinced her to return to the group home in the real realm. Pinocchio wanted Emma to know that because of him inspiring her, Emma has inspired him now to embrace the magic within. After Pinocchio finishes the portal, Emma and Regina are ready, with the latter bringing Robin with her. As Robin gives Regina a feather similar to the one the real Robin was about to give her before he died, Regina believes that the real Robin's spirit still lives on in this Robin. The threesome enter the portal and return to Storybrooke. In Storybrooke At the Pawn Shop, Gideon explains to Belle and Gold about how he was raised by the Black Fairy, but he resisted turning evil on his own will, although he still plans to kill Emma, because her powers as a Savior are the only way to kill his grandmother, and he wants to defeat her. Hours later in the woods, Gold meets with Gideon to offer his help, but Gideon refuses upon being provoked by Gold to attack him. At the loft, David, who by now is frustrated and even has Hook worried while looking for their unwanted visitor earlier, explains to Snow (via cellphone as she is still under the shared sleeping curse) that until the threat is over he won't wake her up. Belle shows up at the loft to tell David about Gideon being the one who'll kill Emma, and she is hoping they can come up with a plan to stop it. As Emma returns to Storybrooke, the vision is about to be played out, and as expected is suddenly approached by Gideon; the two start their sword fight. Gideon eventually manages to knock Emma's sword from her grasp and into the air, catching it, before teleporting his original sword away. Emma‚Äôs family and friends arrive to stop them, but Gideon freezes them, so they can't interfere. Emma gains the upper hand when she regains confidence in herself, gaining control of her shaking hand, and releasing a burst of light magic that sends Gideon into the air, shattering the sword. Emma grabs a fragment of the sword's blade while Gideon is still stunned, and she places the sword at his throat, only to have Gideon (at the request of Gold not to kill him) end the battle by disappearing, until they meet again. Hours later, Emma meets up with August to ask him about their past encounter in Minnesota and discovers that he was keeping tabs on her to keep her safe; both work on a plan that could change Emma's destiny with August adding a new chapter to the storybook. Meanwhile, Gold tells Belle that he doesn't want Gideon killing Emma, or darkening his soul, and the two agree to help their son, who, in the wake of his defeated battle with Emma, takes out his frustrations by destroying the face of the clock tower.

Gordon (born September 7, 1943), known professionally as OyamO, is an American playwright and professor. He is currently a writer-in-residence at the University of Michigan. Early life  OyamO was born in Elyria, Ohio on September 7, 1943; one of seven children to Earnest Gordon, a steel worker, and Bennie Gordon, a housewife. As a child, he enjoyed the stories that his grandfather, a local preacher, would tell him about \\"the old days in the South.\\" In fifth grade, his love of writing was noticed by a teacher after he wrote an assignment about his home life longer than that of any of his peers. Despite the difficulties of attending a predominately white high school, OyamO was an honors student, editor of the school paper and student body president. He wrote fictional stories, poems, and letters to the local newspaper about various issues, which were published. In 1963, OyamO began attending the University of Miami at Oxford, Ohio but dropped out after two-and-a-half years, \\"angry at the educational system.\\" Instead, he moved to New York, where he began working with Harlem's Black Theater Workshop. In 1970, he finished his bachelor's degree at the College of New Rochelle. He went on to receive his MFA in 1981 through Yale University's Playwriting program. Career OyamO became interested in playwriting as a career, when, after working at the New Lafayette Theater as a lighting technician, he took a playwriting class by Ed Bullins, who became his mentor. He has taught at Princeton University, College of New Rochelle, Emory University, and The University of Iowa's Playwrights Workshop. In 1989 he began to teach at the University of Michigan, where he is now an associate professor of theater and English. He has written an episode of HBO's Famous Black American Anthology and optioned a version of his play I Am a Man, also for HBO. His plays have been performed in theatres across the country, including the Yale Repertory Theatre; the Manhattan Theatre Club, the Working Theatre, the Public Theater, the Negro Ensemble Company, Frank Silvera Writers Workshop, New Federal Theatre, Frederick Douglas Creative Arts Center, and many more. He is a member of PEN, Dramatists Guild, New Dramatists (alumni), the Ensemble Studio Theatre, Writers Guild East, the O'Neill Playwrights Center, and the Black Theatre Network. He was awarded a PEW/TCG Playwright-in-Residence Fellowship for the year 2000 at the Philadelphia Theatre Company. He is a site monitor for the NEA and vice president of the Board of Directors of Theatre Communications Group. I Am a Man I Am a Man tells the true story of T.O. Jones., who led the 1968 strike by sanitation workers against the anti-union, segregationist city of Memphis, Tennessee. The strike was precipitated by the death of two black sanitation workers. They were accidentally crushed when their foreman instructed them to wait out a rainstorm by sitting in the back of a garbage truck instead of in the garage with the white workers. Jones stands up to the mayor and fights for the day-to-day struggles of his men. The strike attracted national attention from civil rights activists and black power groups. This strike was also the reason Martin Luther King Jr. was in Memphis when he was assassinated. I Am a Man was well-received, with critics citing it as a historical drama about power, leadership, and the rough-and tumble process of social change. In its multifaceted search for the meaning behind the headline-grabbing events in Memphis, and in its depiction of the roots of black-vs.-black power struggles, it offers both food for thought and an emotional punch.

Mencken Baby Book: Comprising the Contents of H.L. Mencken's What You Ought to Know About Your Baby. Hanley & Belfus. p. 20Smith, Matthew. (2015). Another Person's Poison: A History of Food Allergy. Columbia University Press. p. 213. 1923‚Äì1925: Blind pool case As an assistant United States Attorney General, McCoy was successful at prosecuting brokers for mail fraud. Among other cases, he successfully prosecuted Austin H. Montgomery Jr. and others, who were charged with using blind pools operated by the Community Finance Corporation to defraud $3,000,000 through mail fraud. Austin H. Montgomery Jr. and William L. Cunningham were charged in February 1923 for their connection with the bankrupt Community Finance Corporation. Others indicted in the same case included John A. Berryman, for using the mails to defraud investors in connection with Fidelity Finance Company. For selling securities in a similar operation to Community Finance Corporation, Berryman surrendered to Peter J. McCoy in August 1923. In September 1923, after being accused of a $6,000,000 blind pool deal concerning the Community Finance Corporation, Montgomery was found in Quebec, Canada. A fraud trial was ongoing as of March 1925. In early May 1925, Austin H. Montgomery Jr. and L.H. Schwartz were put on trial on an indictment \\"charging fraudulent use of the mails in connection with the operation of a blind pool by the Community Finance Corporation.\\" They were both convicted on April 2, 1925 in the blind pool case on each of 8 counts, with Montgomery sentenced to five years and Schwartz 18 months. Eight people were indicted for mail fraud total on July 20, including Austin H. Montgomery Jr. of New York, by the Federal Grand Jury, after post office inspectors looked into the activities of Fidelity Finance Company. It had operated in New York, Baltimore, Wilmington in Delaware, Philadelphia, Washington, and York, Pennsylvania. 1924‚Äì1926: Bucketshop case With the New York Times proclaiming him a \\"foe of stock frauds,\\" McCoy became known for conducting the \\"successful bucket shop investigation of 1924,\\" wherein he prosecuted New York stockbroker William S. Silkworth, members of the firm Raynor, Nicholas & Truesdell, and others for operating bucketshops and bucketing. The case was instigated by events starting in February 1922, when the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York was hit \\"without warning\\" with several brokerage and firm failures, followed by more failures in late February 1922 and mid-July 1922, shocking the industry. In July 1922, Consolidated president Silkworth conceded that some Consolidated brokers were corrupt, with reforms to underway to clear the exchange of them. Others accused him of misusing the rescue fund from February, which Silkworth denied. Shortly afterwards, the assembly passed the Martin Act, which essentially banned bucketshops. Working out of the Anti-Fraud Bureau on the issue, Albert Ottinger started an investigation into the failures in earnest in late May 1923. Silkworth testified the following month, and although Assistant Attorney General William F. McKenna failed to implicate Silkworth in the Fuller bankruptcy, he did uncover irregularities in Silkworth's personal finances. Silkworth and others were then prosecuted by McCoy. After Silkworth and seven others were indicted in late May 1924 for connection with the bankruptcy of Raynor, Nicholas & Truesdell, Silkworth pleaded not guilty on May 29, 1924 while held on $8,500 on bail. Trial was set for August. On November 29, 1924, Silkworth was convicted of the fraudulent use of mails in bucketing operations, as well as five others also found guilty of bucketing. In particular, Silkworth was convicted of mail fraud relating to his brokerage and the brokerage house of Raynor, Nicholas and Truesdell in 1922. During the appeal process, McCoy gave testimony before the Circuit Court of Appeals that Raynor, Nicholas & Truesdell had engaged in extensive bucketing operations since its founding late 1920. McCoy further testified that Silkworth had provided the firm's bucketing operations with the protection of Consolidated. The Judge ruled against the motion raised by defendants, which was that bucketing did not have a Federal statute against it at the time, and ruled in favor of McCoy on February 1, 1926 with the November conviction upheld. Silkworth served three months of a year sentence in 1926, with other brokers also serving time. 1925-1950s: Later cases and run for office According to the New York Times, McCoy prosecuted many people who were accused of violating the Food and Drug Acts, selling narcotics, and counterfeiting. McCoy also prosecuted those indicted in the Crager System, or \\"glass casket case,\\" for \\"fraudulently using the mails in the sale of stock of the concern.\\" He resigned as assistant United States Attorney in 1925. A month later, McCoy was appointed an assistant United States Attorney General. McCoy became a member of the law firm Ferris, Shepard, Joyce & McCoy in 1926. The General Electric Company, General Vehicle Corporation, Commonwealth Edison Corporation and the Insull public utilities had all employed him as a member of counsel. He was a Republican ‚Äì Fusion candidate for Justice of the Supreme Court, First Judicial District in 1929, and was unsuccessful in his bid. In 1930 he began representing large realty companies as both a director and as an attorney. The tenants of the Marguery Hotel hired him in 1947 as their attorney. Personal life McCoy was a governor of the New York Athletic Club and the National Republican Club. He was also a member of the Artists and Writers Club, Columbia Club, Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, Westchester Country Club, and the Old Guard Society of Palm Beach.

Slava) is a 2016 Bulgarian drama film written and directed by and . The second film in the directors' \\"newspaper-clippings trilogy\\", the film is a social-realist parable exploring the themes of corruption, class differences, and the rural-urban divide, in contemporary Bulgarian society. It was selected as the Bulgarian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Plot Railway trackman Tsanko Petrov discovers a large amount of money in bundles on the tracks, but instead of taking the cash for himself he notifies the authorities. The sophisticated head of PR at Bulgaria's Ministry of Transport, Julia Staykova, takes the opportunity to deflect a brewing corruption scandal by holding a ceremony to hail Tsanko as a working-class hero. Unkempt and dishevelled with a debilitating stutter, Tsanko is ridiculed by Julia's PR team while they parade him for the press as a hero. In order for the Minister to present Tsanko with a new digital watch, Julia removes Tsanko's own Slava-brand watch, an heirloom passed down from his father. However, she then loses it, ignores him when he tries to contact her, and finally replaces the watch with a fake. In anger, Tsanko goes to the press and exposes the corruption and theft that is endemic in the transportation ministry, and the Minister's complicity in the crime. In an attempt to save the ministry, Julia arranges for Tsanko to be framed for a crime he did not commit. He is then coerced into retracting his earlier accusations, in exchange for release from prison. On his way home, he is accosted by his co-workers, who are angry with him for exposing their crime ring. It is also implied that Tsanko's beloved rabbits had died from neglect, due to his long absence while in prison. The following day, Julia reads in the newspaper that a trackman had committed suicide. Racked with guilt for her role in causing the death of a good man, she gets drunk and searches her office desperately for the missing watch. The following morning, she both finds the watch, and receives word that the dead trackman is actually not Tsanko. Feeling relieved, she drives to his home to return the watch personally. Whereupon she finds a severely injured Tsanko, furious with her for having triggered the entire chain of events. The movie ends with a glimpse of Tsanko grabbing his wrench and Julia screaming, while her oblivious husband sits in their car nearby listening to music.

Biography  There is not much known about the early life and career of Aguilar. Prior to his appointment as Governor-General of the Philippines, the first of only two gubernatorial appointments in the Philippines done by King Charles IV of Spain, he served as a military officer and a gentleman of the bedchamber. His military service earned him the Order of Alc√°ntara. He arrived in the Philippines on 28 August 1793 and assumed office on 1 September. His administration was driven by the reforms initiated by the Enlightenment in Spain, which has become the distinguishing aspect of his long service as governor. Aguilar was the longest serving Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines (12 years, 11 months).  Administration of the Philippines  Detail of Balmis Expedition's routes in The Philippines One of the key accomplishments of Aguilar's administration was setting up the defense of the archipelago. Fortifications were reinforced in Cavite. In 1794, a shipyard was constructed at Binondo in Manila and a naval base built at Corregidor.El Archipi√©lago Filipino. Colecci√≥n de datos. Por algunmos padres de la Misi√≥n de la Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s en estas islas. Tomo I, Washington, Imprenta del Gobierno, 1900, p√°gina 396 y 397. These were set up in order to make boats for military campaigns against the Moros. In 1796, two regiments of professional native troops were formed, the first time the native contingent of the colonial armed forces was professionalized. These regiments were named Granaderos de Luzon (Luzon Grenadiers) and Granaderos de Batangas (Batangas Grenadiers). In addition to this, five battalions of militia were organized. In 1800, the Naval Command was formed in order to check foreign vessels entering the archipelago. Six years later, a force of 300 marine grenadiers were organized. Aguilar was able to effectively advocate the opening of Manila to foreign trade, a proposal that had been attempted by his predecessors, F√©lix Berenguer de Marquina (1788‚Äì1793) and Jos√© Basco y Vargas (1778‚Äì1787). However, it would only be by the royal decree of September 6, 1834 when the Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s (Economic Societies of Friends of the Country) was abolished and Manila was completely opened to international trade. He was also able to reprint and disseminate former Governor-General Jos√© Antonio Ra√≥n y Guti√©rrez's revised version of the \\"Ordinances of Good Government\\", a document first drafted by Pedro Manuel de Arand√≠a Santisteban. Meanwhile, in 1804, he proposed the modernization of Manila. This had been done by massive public works projects, creation of cultural institutions, and the illumination of Manila streets. It was also during the administration of Aguilar that the Balmis Expedition (1803‚Äì1806) arrived in the Philippines. The expedition, led by Doctor Francisco Javier de Balmis, aimed to vaccinate people against smallpox, and the Philippines was included in the number of destinations of the mission.de Romo, Ana Cecilia Rodr√≠guez (1997).

Sino-Portuguese history in Phuket The old town in Phuket has a history as the center of a tin mining and trading province. In the era of Western imperialism, after 1511 (2054 BE), Portuguese settlers came to Phuket and to the trade port of Malacca. The settlers brought Western culture with them, as well as science, religion, and their own architectural styles. Portuguese settlers employed Chinese workers to build their houses and establishments. These structures mixed Portuguese and Chinese art styles together, giving rise to Sino- Portuguese architecture.  Sino-Portuguese style  The characteristics of Sino-Portuguese architecture is a mix of European and Chinese styles or simply colonial architecture. These older buildings were built by the Chinese. The building has the design (painting) in Chinese format, but the structure is Portuguese. Typically, the building is a one or two storey mixed commercial- residential building. The wall has strength due to the weight of the tiles on the roof. The roof is clad in curved tiles of Chinese provenance.

History A rabbit hunt along the Faneca at the turn of the century (1903) The Barreiro da Faneca was integrated into the √Årea de Paisagem Protegida do Barreiro da Faneca (Protected Landscape of Barreiro da Faneca) with the promulgation of Regional Decree 47/2008/A (7 November 2008), administered by the Secret√°rio Regional do Ambiente e do Mar (Regional Secretariat of the Environment and the Sea).GRA (7 November 2008), p.7787 Geography The bay of Tagarete (from the west) on the edge of the northern plateau, alongside the Faneca (with islet of Lagoinhas in the background) An early 21st century view of the arid reddish clays of the area The Protected Landscape of Barreiro da Faneca extends from Ponta dos Frades until the northern cliff of the island, and includes not only Barreiro da Faneca and the bays of Raposo, Cr√© and Tagarete; the protected area includes a superficie of approximately 1542 hectares.SRA (2014) Contiguous to the protected area is the Bay of Cr√©, known for the accumulation of sediments, such as limestone and fossilized conglomerates, with visible marine fossils. The Bay of Raposo, nearby is known for its cliffs, waterfall and river mouth, while the Bay of Tagarete is also known for deposits of marine fossils. Physical geography Barreiro da Fancea is a superficial area of arid and clay terrain, built up from the geological area known as Forma√ß√£o de Feteiras (Feteiras Formation), that corresponds to the most recent volcanism that was essentially explosive, and constituted of pyroclastic materials. Later, these projectiles and deposits were altered in reddish clays due to the warm and humid climate, resulting in an area of semi-desert-like geology composed of yellowish-red sands. The location is situated at above sea level and includes a hummocky surface, with gentle slopes of 4-5% incline and a limited drainage capability. The areas with limited or lacking vegetation the soils are susceptible to erosion, resulting in the formation of dunes caused by hydrological or wind-based erosion. These conditions have resulted in a landscape that is completely unique to Santa Maria in the archipelago, resulting in it becoming named the Deserto Vermelho dos A√ßores (Red Desert of the Azores). Biome At the same time, there has been encroachment of vegetation in 70% of the area, including the spontaneous blooming of endemic species, such as Heather (Erica azorica), White wood (Picconia azorica), Globe daisy shrub(Scabiosa nitens), Spurge (Euphorbia azorica), and other species of important Laurel and Faia-da-terra. The group of bays are limited by large cliffs with extreme slopes, with altitudes ranging from above sea level, and are recognized for their ecological importance and distinct landscapes, that include the islet of Lagoinhas, known for support of marine bird habits. Populations of migratory and marine birds like Shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea borealis), Garajau-comum (Sterna hirundo) and Garajau-rosado (Sterna dougallii).

The episode is popularly cited as containing the first example of a scripted interracial kiss on United States television, although other previous instances have since come to light. Background The first interracial kiss on television seems to have occurred almost 10 years earlier on British television on February 1, 1959, in the UK on the ITV Armchair Theatre adaptation of Ted Willis's play Hot Summer Night. A later broadcast, You in Your Small Corner, featured a kiss between black actor Lloyd Reckord and white actress Elizabeth MacLennan, and was broadcast live on the UK's ITV channel in June 1962. Another such kiss occurred in 1966, when in The Wild Wild West, James T. West (Robert Conrad) and Princess Ching Ling (Pilar Seurat), shared a white and Asian interracial kiss (\\"The Night the Dragon Screamed\\", aired Jan 14 1966). In the same year on I Spy, Kelly Robinson (Robert Culp) and Sam (France Nuyen) also had a white and Asian interracial kiss (\\"The Tiger\\", aired 1966 Jan 5). There had also been a kiss on the cheek between Sammy Davis, Jr. and Nancy Sinatra on Movin' with Nancy in 1967, a year before \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" aired.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bydSevpkXQ0&t;=34m45s In Star Trek For that matter, it wasn't even the first interracial kiss on Star Trek itself. In the Season Two episode \\"Mirror, Mirror,\\" first broadcast on October 6, 1967, Kirk and Lt. Marlena Moreau (played by Filipino actress BarBara Luna) kiss on the lips,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbeVZPFCP3Y while Mirror-Sulu kisses Uhura's neck.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CJdFppsHeo The former of these kisses is shown as a consensual part of an existing romantic relationship. In \\"Plato's Stepchildren,\\" in contrast, the kiss is being shown as involuntary, being forced by telekinesis, perhaps to avoid any hint of romance that would risk outrage among some viewers. Also, William Shatner recalls in Star Trek Memories that NBC insisted their lips never touch (the technique of turning their heads away from the camera was used to conceal this). However, Nichelle Nichols insists in her autobiography Beyond Uhura (written in 1994 after Shatner's book) that the kiss was real, even during takes in which her head obscures their lips.Nichelle Nichols, Beyond Uhura: Star Trek and Other Memories, G.P. Putnam & Sons New York, 1994. pp.195-198 When NBC executives learned of the kiss they became concerned it would anger TV stations in the Deep South.Nichols, p.195 Earlier in 1968, NBC had expressed similar concern over a musical sequence in a Petula Clark special in which she touched Harry Belafonte's arm, a moment cited as the first occasion of direct physical contact on American television between a man and woman of different races. At one point during negotiations, the idea was brought up of having Spock kiss Uhura instead (as Spock was half Vulcan), but William Shatner insisted that they stick with the original script. NBC finally ordered that two versions of the scene be shot--one in which Kirk and Uhura kissed and one in which they did not.Nichelle Nichols bio at NNDB.com Having successfully recorded the former version of the scene, Shatner and Nichelle Nichols deliberately flubbed every take of the latter version, thus forcing the episode to go out with the kiss intact.Nicholls, p.195-196Nichelle Nichols also claimed this to be fact in an August 2006 Comedy Central online interview, recorded the day of her participation in the network's roast of Shatner. As Nichelle Nichols writes:Nichols, p.196 > Knowing that Gene was determined to air the real kiss, Bill shook me and > hissed menacingly in his best ham-fisted Kirkian staccato delivery, \\"I! > WON'T! KISS! YOU! I! WON'T! KISS! YOU!\\" It was absolutely awful, and we were > hysterical and ecstatic. The director was beside himself, and still > determined to get the kissless shot. So we did it again, and it seemed to be > fine. \\"Cut! Print! That's a wrap!\\" The next day they screened the dailies, > and although I rarely attended them, I couldn't miss this one.

When the non-kissing scene came on, everyone in the room > cracked up. The last shot, which looked okay on the set, actually had Bill > wildly crossing his eyes. It was so corny and just plain bad it was > unusable. The only alternative was to cut out the scene altogether, but that > was impossible to do without ruining the entire episode. Finally, the guys > in charge relented: \\"To hell with it. Let's go with the kiss.\\" I guess they > figured we were going to be cancelled in a few months anyway. And so the > kiss stayed. There were, however, few contemporary records of any complaints commenting on the scene.Nichols, pp.196-197 Nichelle Nichols observes that \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\", which first aired on November 22, 1968, \\"received a huge response. We received one of the largest batches of fan mail ever, all of it very positive, with many addressed to me from girls wondering how it felt to kiss Captain Kirk, and many to him from guys wondering the same thing about me. However, almost no one found the kiss offensive\\" except from a single mildly negative letter from one white Southerner who wrote: \\"I am totally opposed to the mixing of the races. However, any time a red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like Uhura, he ain't gonna fight it.\\" Nichols notes that \\"for me, the most memorable episode of our last season was 'Plato's Stepchildren.'\\"Nichols, p.193  Reception  The scene in this episode caused such an impact to be noted in its own right, although Kirk is noted to have kissed 19 women (and/or aliens) during the course of the original series run. In 2016, TVline ranked the interracial kiss in this episode as one of the top twenty moments of Star Trek. In 2016, Radio Times ranked the kiss between Uhura and Kirk as the 25th best moment in all Star Trek, including later spin-off series. The cultural impact of the kiss was noted by National Geographic, in 2016. WhatCulture ranked this the 8th best romantic-sexual moment in Star Trek.

Description Zieria collina is a spreading shrub with velvety hairs and which grows to a height of . The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are composed of elliptic to lance-shaped leaflets long and wide. The upper surface of the leaflets is a darker shade of green than the lower surface and usually has a few hairs and tubercles while the lower surface in densely covered with velvety hairs. The leaf stalk is long. The flowers are bright white, about in diameter and are arranged in groups of 15 to 30 in leaf axils and the groups are usually longer than the leaves. The sepal have four lobes and there are four petals. In common with other zierias, there are only four stamens. Flowering mainly occurs from August to October but flowers are often seen at other times. Fruit opens about six weeks after flowering. Taxonomy and naming Zieria collina was first formally described in 1932 by Cyril Tenison White and the description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. The specific epithet (collina) is a Latin word meaning \\"of a hill\\". New South Wales Flora Online features a photo of the Herbarium Sheet.

Four club policy and the Mongrel Mob conflict In the 1980s Western Australia was home to four outlaw motorcycle clubs, Club Deroes, Gypsy Jokers, Gods Garbage and the Coffin Cheaters. All except the Gypsy Jokers originated in WA. In 1989 these four gangs combined forces to violently eject the New Zealand-based street gang, the Mongrel Mob, which was attempting to establish itself in Perth. Events escalated over a five-day period where Selwyn Wharepapa, one of the leaders of the Perth Mongrel Mob, was injured in the bombing of the Mongrel Mob's metalwork shop with two kilograms of gelignite and the Mongrel Mob retaliated with an attempted explosion at a tattoo shop linked with the Gypsy Jokers. The following night police raided three homes, arresting seven people, including Wharepapa in possession of firearms, baseball bats and drugs. Two days later, Wharepapa was shot in the groin in the Perth suburb of Swan View. Gypsy Joker Paul Hugo and Gods Garbage member Ronald Scott were arrested and charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It was enough to force the Mongrel Mob to leave Perth.

She was the national team's first choice goalkeeper at the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. At club level she collected five women's Serie A winner's medals and three Coppa Italia winner's medals.  Club career  Swiss-born Antonini began playing football at 12 years old when her family returned to Italy and settled in Teramo. She became Ascoli's starting goalkeeper aged 13 and helped the club to promotion from Serie C to Serie A. In 1989 she made her first transfer to Zambelli Reggiana, where an experienced team containing Carolina Morace, Elisabetta Vignotto and Anne O'Brien captured Antonini's first league title. She won a further four league titles and three national cups but retired at 29 years old, dissatisfied that her teams kept going bust and unhappy with the general lack of career prospects on offer for elite female footballers in Italy.  International career  Antonini was drafted into the Italy women's national football team in 1990, following good form for title- winning Reggiana and the suspension of Eva Russo. She made her debut in August 1990 in a 4‚Äì1 win over England, played at Wembley Stadium as a curtain raiser for the 1990 FA Charity Shield. At the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, Antonini was ever-present as Italy reached the quarter-final and lost 3‚Äì2 to Norway after extra time. At UEFA Women's Euro 1993 hosts Italy reached the final and suffered another defeat by Norway, 1‚Äì0 this time. Antonini had been replaced in the team for the tournament by Giorgia Brenzan, with whom she enjoyed a friendly rivalry for the national team goalkeeper position. She returned to the number one role for UEFA Women's Euro 1995, but yet another defeat by Norway in the second-round cost the Italians a place at the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. In December 1996 Antonini won the last of her 32 caps in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Germany. Playing style  According to the Dizionario del Calcio Italiano, Antonini was a goalkeeper of rare talent. She was described as more instinctive and spectacular than her longstanding rival Giorgia Brenzan, and capable of making extraordinary acrobatic saves. However, her extroverted style sometimes left her prone to lapses in concentration.

Founded in 1996 by VSS Mani, the company is headquartered in Mumbai, India. In addition to its headquarters, Justdial has offices in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, and Pune. In 2020 Justdial had 10,984 employees and a database of approximately 29.4 million listings and 536,236 active paid campaigns. History In 1987, while working for a yellow pages company, VSS Mani thought of replacing yellow pages with a database of information that users could call to receive current information about local business listings. To launch his venture, Mani acquired the Mumbai landline phone number 2888-8888. After several years of seeking financial backing for his idea, Mani launched Justdial in 1996 with a seed capital of Rs. 50,000, five employees, a few rented computers, and borrowed furniture. In 2007 an Internet and mobile app version of the database called Justdial.com was launched. On 20 May 2013 Justdial went public at a price between INR 897 and 898. Of the total 17.5 million shares, 13.5 million of them were offered to the public, while the rest were given to fifteen previous investors at INR 530 per share. To encourage retail investment, Justdial had promised that they would buy back shares from retail investors at the IPO price if Justdial's share price fell sharply within the first six months. By the close of the market on the day of the IPO, the majority of new investments had come from foreign institutional investors. On 5 August of the next year, Justdial's share price reached a high of INR 1,894.70, subsequently decreasing to the triple digits in 2015. Products and services Justdial's \\"Justdial\\" service is a database of business listings that users can either access by phone or online. The company also operates \\"Justdial Social\\", a service that aggregates content from social media websites, TV broadcast, news, and other sources; and \\"Search Plus Service\\", a service that manages online transactions via the web and mobile apps.  Security Flaws  On 10th October 2019 Indian-based independent security researcher Ehraz Ahmed detected a major security flaw in Justdial‚Äôs Register API. The flaw allowed competent hackers to log into any Justdial account by simply placing the phone number in the username parameter. By doing so, this granted the hacker access to any person‚Äôs Justdial account. This vulnerability puts the user‚Äôs personal data at risk, but also compromises the user‚Äôs social profile since the hacker could use the system ID generated by exploiting the flaw to access the Just Dial Pay account, and post on the user‚Äôs social profile. Justdial acknowledged that there was a bug in one of its API. There was no loss of any data or financial loss reported.

It has rough fibrous bark near the base and smooth greyish and orange to bronze bark higher up. It has lance-shaped leaves, yellow or creamy flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and hemispherical fruit with strongly raised valves.foliage and fruit Description Eucalyptus ammophila is a mallee that grows to high, rarely a small, multistemmed tree, and forms a lignotuber. The trunk has rough, fibrous, greyish brown bark and the upper parts of the trunk and the branches have smooth greyish and orange to bronze-coloured bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have square stems and broad lance-shaped to egg- shaped leaves that are long and wide with a short petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide with a petiole long. Both sides of the leaf are the same dull green, although bluish green at first. The flowers are arranged in groups of between seven and eleven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, each flower on a pedicel about long. The mature flower buds are oval to spindle- shaped, yellow or cream-coloured, long and about wide. The operculum is cone- shaped and about long. The fruit is a hemispherical capsule long and wide with the four, sometimes five, strongly raised valves. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus ammophila was first formally described in 1994 by Ian Brooker and Andrew Slee from a specimen collected in the Maranoa region of Queensland, and the description was published in the journal Austrobaileya. According to Brooker and Slee, the specific epithet (ammophila) is derived from the Greek ammos, \\"sand\\" and phila \\"loving\\" referring to this species' preference for growing on sandplains. In ancient Greek, \\"loving\\" is however philos (œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ) (masculine) or philƒì (œÜŒØŒªŒ∑) (feminine).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940).

Forgotten Kingdom is Causley's first album of entirely self-written material although does include references to traditional song throughout. It was intended to celebrate ten years since the release of Causley's debut album Fruits of the Earth in 2005 but the release was delayed due to poor health on the part of original producer Phil Beer. Production of the album was then completed by Show of Hands regular producer Mark Tucker at The Green Room studios in East Devon. Forgotten Kingdom is Causley's most ambitious solo recording project to date and has the largest line-up of guest musicians of any of his albums. This guests include many well known names from the British folk scene who happen to be based in Devon such as Seth Lakeman and Show of Hands as well as some local stalwarts of the more traditional folk music scene in the county. The theme of the album centres on the history of Devon and its neighbouring counties but also looks at Causley's own personal connection to the county and his experience of growing-up within it. The \\"forgotten kingdom\\" alluded to in the title is the Celtic Brythonic kingdom of Dumnonia which Causley previously referenced in his 2011 album; Dumnonia which was a collection of traditional songs from Devon. Not all of the songs on Forgotten Kingdom have a traditional folk feel to them and several hint at Causley's songwriting having more modern and expansive influences. The album received highly positive reviews from The Guardian, BBC Music Magazine and fRoots magazine among others, as well as airplay on radio shows such the Mark Radcliffe Folk Show on BBC Radio 2 and the Tom Robinson show on BBC Radio 6 Music. In the fRoots review, Colin Irwin confirmed his previously stated opinion that Causley is one of the finest folk singers of his generation.

Noted for their warlike character, the Chiriguanos retained their lands in the Andes foothills of southeastern Bolivia from the 16th to the 19th centuries by fending off, first, the Inca Empire, later, the Spanish Empire, and, still later, independent Bolivia. The Chiriguanos were finally subjugated in 1892. The Chiriguanos of history nearly disappeared from public consciousness after their 1892 defeat‚Äîbut were reborn beginning in the 1970s. In the 21st century the descendants of the Chiriguanos call themselves Guaranis which links them with millions of speakers of Guarani dialects and languages in Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil.Comb√©s, Isabelle (2005), \\"Las batallas de Kuruyuki. Variaciones sobre una derrota chiriguana,\\" Bulletin de l'Institut d'Etudes Andines, Vol 34, No. 2, p. 221, 230-231 The census of 2001 counted 81,011 Guaran√≠, mostly Chiriguanos, over 15 years of age living in Bolivia.Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, \\"The Guarani People and the Situation of the Captive Communities in the Bolivian Chaco\\", pp. 1-2, http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/ComunidadesCautivas.eng/Chap.Iv.htm, accessed 24 Oct 2016 A 2010 census counted 18,000 Ava Guarani in Argentina. The Eastern Bolivian Guaran√≠ language was spoken by 33,000 people in Bolivia, 15,000 in Argentina, and a few hundred in Paraguay.Eastern Bolivian Guaran√≠ at Ethnologue Origin of the name and people Ethnic groups of Bolivia (2006). The Guarani (Chiriguanos) occupied a larger area in the 16th through 19th century. The common name for the Eastern Bolivian Guaran√≠ since the 16th century has been variations of the name \\"Chirihuano\\", a word of Quechua origin which referred to itinerant doctors or medicine vendors (curanderos) from the Bolivian province of Larecaja, called also Collahuayas, Yunge√±os and Charasanis. Because \\"chiri\\" means \\"cold\\" in Quechua, the word chirihuano has been interpreted with the pejorative meaning of \\"people who die from freezing\\".Alconini, Sylvia (2004), \\"The Southeastern Inka Frontier against the Chiriguanos: Structure and Dynamics of the Inka Imperial Borderlands,\\" Latin American Antiquity, Vol. 15, No. 4, p. 394. Downloaded from JSTOR. In the late 16th century, the Quechua term was Hispanized to Chiriguanos. Although Chiriguanos usually refers to Guarani language speaking peoples in eastern Bolivia, the Spanish sometimes applied the term to all Guarani peoples and other lowland people speaking non-Guarani languages living in the eastern Andes and the Gran Chaco region.Scholl, Jonathan (2015), \\"At the Limits of Empire: Incas, Spaniards, and the Ava-Guarani (Chiriguanaes) on the Charca- Chiriguana Frontier, Southeastern Andes (1450s-1620s)\\", Dissertation, University of Florida, pp. 12, 78-85 The Chiriguanos called themselves \\"ava,\\" meaning humans. The Guarani people are believed by archaeologists to have originated in the central part of the Amazon rainforest and migrated southward at an uncertain date. Equally uncertain is the date they arrived in eastern Bolivia. The historical Chirguano were a synthesis of the Chan√© and the Guaran√≠. The Chiroguanos migrated from Paraguay to Bolivia in the beginning of the 16th century absorbing, assimilating, and enslaving the Chan√©.Alconini, Sonia (2016), Southeast Inka Frontiers: Boundaries and Interactions, Gainesville: University Press of Florida, pp. 26-34. Downloaded from Project Muse. Some Ava Guaran√≠ peoples may still have been migrating into the eastern Andes at the time of the Spanish conquest in the 1530s, possibly drawn by the riches of the Incas and Spanish and in search of the mythical land of \\"Candire\\", the \\"land without evil\\", rich with gold and other wealth.Alconini (2004), p. 395 Culture The Chiriguanos occupied the foothills between the high Andes and the Altiplano and the flat plains of the Gran Chaco, living mostly at elevations between and .Google Earth The climate is sub-tropical and precipitation during the rainy season is adequate for growing crops. The region is characterized by steep ridges and deep river valleys making access and communication difficult. The Chriguanos were never united as a people into a single political unit, but instead functioned on the village level and formed loosely-organized regional coalitions headed by a paramount chieftain, or tubicha rubicha (capit√°n grande in Spanish).Langer, Erick D. (2009), Expecting Pears from an Elm Tree,, Durham: Duke University Press, p. 13, 290 The Chiriguanos had a warrior ethos, fighting among themselves as well as outsiders. They said they were \\"men without masters\\" and considered themselves superior to other peoples whom they called \\"tapua\\" or slaves.Scholl, pp. 50, 53 The Spanish described them in the most unfavorable terms possible: without religion and government, dedicated to war and cannibalism, naked and sexually promiscuous. That litany of offenses justified, in Spanish eyes, undertaking wars of \\"fire and blood\\" against the Chiriguanos and enslaving them.Scholl, pp. 50-51 The Chiriguanos acquired horses and guns from the Spanish, but their preferred method of fighting was on foot and with bow and arrow. The Spanish by contrast preferred to fight on horseback and with guns, although guns were in short supply on the frontier for much of history. The Chiriguanos were an agricultural people, cultivating maize and other crops. They initially lived in very large longhouses in villages, but, probably for defense, they came to live in small dispersed settlements of individual houses.Langer, pp. 14-15 Until the 19th century the Chiriguanos proved impervious to the attempts of missionaries to convert them to Christianity. A Jesuit mission in 1767 had only 268 Chiriguano converts, as compared to the tens of thousands the Jesuits had converted eastward in Paraguay among other Guarani speaking peoples.Langer, p. 16 Early wars against the Incas and Spanish Spanish estimates of the number of Chiriguano warriors between 1558 and 1623 range from 500 to 4,000.Saignes, Thierry, edited by Isabelle Comb√©s (n.d.), Historia del Pueblo Chiriguano, Lima: Institution Frances de Estudias Andinas, p. 73 Despite epidemics of European diseases, the Chiriguano population, probably due in part to the incorporation of the Chan√©, rose to a high of more than 100,000 in the late 18th century.Langer, pp. 15-16 Large-scale Chiriguano raids against the Inca began in the 1520s. The Inca established defensive settlements, including what are now the archaeological sites of Oroncota and Samaipata, to fend off the Chiriguanos.\\"Fuerte de Samaipata--UNESCO World Heritage Centre\\" https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/883. Accessed 23 Sep 2016; Parssinen, Martti, Suriainen, Ari, and Korpisaari, Antti, \\"Western Amazonia- Amazonia Ocidental\\", pp. 32. 45-53. https://www.academia.edu/7322394/Fortifications_Related_to_the_Inca_Expansion, accessed 24 Sep 2016 The Spanish became concerned with the raids of the Chiriguanos in the 1540s because they threatened the indigenous (Indian) workers of the rich silver mines at Potos√≠ and surrounding areas. The Spanish also wished to establish links between their settlements in the Andes and those in Paraguay. In 1564, under a leader named Vitapue, the Chriguanos destroyed two Spanish settlements in eastern Bolivia and a generalized war between the Spaniards and the Chiriguanos began.Scholl, pp. 18, 259 In 1574, The Viceroy of Peru, Francisco de Toledo led a large‚Äîand unsuccessful invasion‚Äîinto Chiriguano territory and in 1584 the Spanish declared a \\"war of fire and blood\\" against the Chiriguanos.Saignes, p. 193 In 1594, the Chiriguano forced the abandonment of the Spanish settlement of Santa Cruz and its relocation to the present site of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Some of the settlers abandoned the area and floated down the Amazon River to its mouth and returned to Spain.Gott, Richard (1993), Land without Evil: Utopian Journeys across the South American Watershed, London: Verso, pp. 161-163 The Spanish in the early 17th century followed a policy of attempting to populate the Andean foothills where the Chiriguanos lived and established three main centers as frontier defense: Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Tomina, east of Sucre), and Tarija. By about 1620, however, the Spanish had given up ambitious attempts to advance the frontier. Records are lacking for the next 100 years, but it appears it was a period of relative peace in which Spaniard and indigenous allies enjoyed an uneasy co-existence with the Chiriguanos, although punctuated by mutual raids on each other.Scholl pp. 23, 451, 472-496 The Jesuits, successful in their missionary enterprises in Paraguay, attempted to Christianize the Chiriguanos as early as the 1630s, but had little success.Gott, p. 180 18th century What historian Thierry Saignes called the \\"General Uprising\\" of the Chiriguanos began in 1727. The underlying causes of the uprising were the Spanish colonization of areas near Tarija, led by Jesuit, Dominican, and Franciscan missionaries and Spanish cattle ranchers who coveted the rich pasture lands of the Andes foothills. The spark that ignited the war was the punishment by the missionaries of Chiriguano neophytes at Jesuit and Dominican missions, especially that of Juan Bautista Aruma, who became one of the three principal leaders of the uprising. However, during the war, the Chiriguanos were not united. Their leaders pursued different strategies and some Chiriguanos did not join the uprising.Saignes, pp. 92-94 In October 1727, with cooperation from the Toba and Mocov√≠ peoples, the Chiriguanos attacked with an army of 7,000 men, destroying Christian missions and Spanish ranches east of Tarija, killing more than 200 Spaniards and taking many women and children prisoner. In March 1728, they attacked Monteagudo (then called Sauces), burned the Church and took 80 Spanish prisoners. The Spanish counterattacked from Santa Cruz in July 1728 with an army of 1200 Spaniards and 200 Chiquitano archers recruited from the Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos in eastern Bolivia. The Spanish army destroyed many Chiriguano villages, killed more than 200 people, and took more than 1,000 prisoners. Violating a truce to negotiate an exchange of prisoners, the Spanish captured 62 Chiriguano leaders, including Aruma, and enslaved them in the silver mines. Spanish expeditions into Chiriguano territory in 1729 and 1731 were less successful. In 1735 the Chiriguano besieged Santa Cruz but the siege was broken by 340 Chiquitano warriors sent from Jesuit missions. In that same year, the Chiriguanos destroyed two reestablished Jesuit missions near Tarija. The Chiriguano integrated some of their captives into their society; others on both sides were released or ransomed, with slavery being a common fate of captives of the Spanish, especially women and children.Gott, pp. 180-182; Saignes, pp 92-94, 220-22; 236; Langer, p. 44 After the General Uprising, additional wars in the 18th century between the Chiriguano and Spanish occurred in 1750 and from 1793 to 1799.Comb√©s, p. 223 The brush-fire wars between Spaniard and Chiriguano were largely conflicts about resources. The Chiriguanos were farmers who grew corn; the Spanish and Mestizo settlers encroaching upon or living in Chiriguano territory were ranchers who raised cattle. The ranchers and their cattle destroyed Chiriguano settlements and corn fields and the Chiriguanos killed cattle and often ranchers.Langer, pp. 45--47 19th century According to scholar Erick Langer, the Chiriguanos held the upper hand in the Andes borderlands until the 1860s. Spanish-speaking communities, called Creole or \\"karai\\" as most of the people were of mixed Spanish/Indian heritage, survived by paying tribute to local Chiriguano groups. However, Chiriguano maize crops failed during a drought from 1839 to 1841 and the Chiriguanos resorted to increased raids on cattle herds, both eating the cattle and killing them to halt the advances of the Hispanic ranchers. As the demand for meat increased in the rest of Bolivia, the pressure on the Chiriguanos by the ranchers and soldiers became more intense. Also, it appears that the population of the Chiriguanos declined after the 18th century.Langer, pp. 41-47 \\"The most important factor in the loss of Chiriguano independence was the reestablishment of the Franciscan missions\\" beginning in 1845.Langer, 50 After more than two centuries of failure, Christian missions enjoyed some success among the Chiriguanos. The reasons for this success seemed to be that many Chiriguanos turned to the missions for protection from internal disputes and conflict with the Creole ranchers and settlers, the Bolivian government, and other Indian peoples. The missions and the Bolivian government benefited from the labor of the mission Chiriguanos and also recruited many of them as soldiers against independent Chiriguanos and other Indians. The numbers and the independence of the Chiriguano also declined beginning in the 1850s when many of them began migrating to Argentina to work on sugar plantations. By the 1860s, the Bolivian government was taking a more aggressive stand against the Chiriguanos, awarding large grants of land to ranchers in their territory. Outright massacres of Chiriguanos became more common. Chiriguano fighters were routinely executed when captured and women and children sold into servitude.Langer, pp. 48-49, 60, 114-117 The Chiriguanos made two last attempts to retain their independence: the Huacaya War of 1874-1877, in which rebellious Chiriguanos were defeated, and the rebellion of 1892. The 1892 rebellion broke out in January at the mission of Santa Rosa de Cuevo. It was led by a 28 year old man named Chapiaguasu, who styled himself Apiaguaiki Tumpa (Eunuch of God) and said that he had been sent to earth to save the Chiriguanos from Christianity and the Franciscan missionaries. With an army of 1,300 Chiriguanos, Apiaguaiki led a failed attack against the mission on January 21. The Creoles led a counter-attack on January 28 with 50 soldiers, 140 Creole militia, and 1,500 friendly Indians armed with bows and arrows. In the Battle of Kuruyuki, the Creole army killed more than 600 Chiriguanos with losses of their own of only four killed, all Indians. Following the battle, the Creole army massacred Chiriguanos who surrendered and sold women and children into slavery. The 2,000 Chiriguanos resident at the Santa Rosa de Cuevo mission mostly supported the Creole army.Langer, pp. 186-195 Apiaguaiki was later captured and on March 29, 1892 was tortured and executed by Bolivian authorities.Hurtado Guzman, Emilio, \\"Apiaguaiqui Tumpa\\" http://www.biblioteca.org.ar/libros/153112.pdf, accessed 23 Oct 2016 The movement he led was similar to other contemporary Millenarian movements around the world such as the Ghost Dance in the United States and the Boxer Rebellion in China. 20th and 21st centuries The influence of the Fransciscan missions declined during the 20th century. A Chiriguano leader named Ubaldino Cundeye, his wife, Octavia, and relatives moved to La Paz in 1930 and asserted that the Chiriguanos had rights as citizens of Bolivia. Cundeye campaigned for the Chiriguanos to reclaim land from the missions. However, the Chaco War (1932-1935) resulted in the dispossession of much of the remaining land belonging to the missions and the Chiriguanos. The Chiriguanos largely became migrant, landless workers, many in Argentina.

He achieved considerable attention for his peace activism when his mother, Charlotte E. Keyes wrote an article for McCall's, Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came (October 1966). The title phrase, based on a quote from a Carl Sandburg poem, became part of the anti-Vietnam-War lexicon. The slogan also went on to become the basis of the film Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came. His cartography work has won two awards.  Biography = Personal life  Gene was born October 24, 1941 to Charlotte Keyes (n√©e Shachmann) and Scott Keyes. His father was a Quaker and his mother was Jewish. Both were pacifists. They had been anti- militarists in the 1930s though they both supported American involvement in World War II as they believed Hitler had to be stopped by force if necessary. After the war they became more involved with the Quaker movement. Young Gene absorbed his parents' pacifism even to the point of worrying about the insects his mother killed as she cleaned house. Keyes has two brothers and one sister. His brother Ralph Keyes is the author of the best-seller Is There Life After High School? which became a Broadway musical. In 1968, Keyes married his girlfriend Jane Gordon. They moved to Canada in 1973 when Jane found employment there. They have two children, Jeremy David, born in 1976 and Rachel Elizabeth, born in 1979. In 1980 Jane filed for divorce demanding sole custody of the children. Without a lawyer, Keyes fought for equal-shared- parenting all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada but was only given limited \\"visitation\\" rights when the divorce was finalized in 1984. He has lived in Canada since 1973 but retained his American citizenship. He has lived with his partner Mary Jo Gra√ßa since 1989. Currently Dr. Keyes is retired and living in Berwick, Nova Scotia, where he continues to manage his website, uploading material about Bernard J. S. Cahilll, the Cahill-Keyes projection, Esperanto, and strategic nonviolent defense.  Polaris Action  After graduating high school, Keyes was accepted at Harvard, class of 1963, and during his time there joined demonstrations at Woolworth's in support of desegregating their stores in the American South (inspired by the Feb. 1960 Greensboro sit-ins), taught Spanish at the local jail, leafleted about nuclear weapons, and joined a variety of liberal groups. His activism led to a deterioration of his grades. Then in February 1961, he left university to join Polaris Action, an activist group bent on civil disobedience to protest against nuclear weapons. Polaris submarines were nuclear-ballistic-missile firing boats now supplanted by the Trident fleet. He wrote his parents that \\"the business of Polaris Action is mostly leafleting, speaking, clerical, canvassing, with infrequent melodramatic and physically dangerous moments of submarine boarding. It's the Gandhian idea of lying across the railroad tracks, except we're lying across the Polaris submarines.\\" He moved to New London, Connecticut to live on a farm with other members of the Polaris Action group. While his parents tried to dissuade him from actual civil disobedience, by August he was in jail for trying to board the submarine Ethan Allen. He served seventeen days.  Draft Card Burning  When he had turned 18 during university Keyes was required to register for the draft. He requested conscientious objector status from the Selective Service Commission. But he felt uneasy about it, thinking this was still part of the war system. \\"All the hospital work a conscientious objector could do in two years would not make up for a single day of napalm and pellet bombs,\\" he wrote. In 1962-63 he enrolled at Pendle Hill, a Quaker study center near Philadelphia, to research ideas for unarmed military forces. In March 1963, he went to Washington to testify before a Senate subcommittee against the bill to extend the induction provisions of the Universal Military Training and Service Act and urged \\"establishing an integral strategic nonviolent national defense system...What is suggested is a basic reorientation of the defense posture of this nation\\". \\"My purpose,\\" he went on, \\"is not to secure a special berth in the ship of state while others man its artillery.\\" He was quite willing \\"to participate in the national defense\\" if the defense establishment changed its \\"violent premises\\" to peaceful ones. Gene Keyes about to burn his draft card outside the Champaign Selective Service Offices - Dec. 24, 1963 Meanwhile, Keyes had decided on a course of action to dramatize his position. On October 3 he cancelled his application for conscientious objector status. In December that year he wrote to two local newspapers in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois to announce that he would celebrate Christmas, the time to think about peace on earth, by burning his draft card. He wrote, \\"As a prayer for peace on earth, I will be holding a vigil on Christmas Eve in front of the local draft board.\\" He proposed to stand there for twelve hours starting at noon. \\"At midnight Christmas Eve I will be using my draft card to light a candle.\\" On December 24, 1963 he stood outside the draft board wearing a sign that read, \\"To Light This Candle with a Draft Card - A Prayer for Peace on Earth.\\" He spoke to people throughout his twelve-hour vigil and at midnight, with about twenty- five people present, his girl friend Jane held the candle while he held the draft card with a pair of tongs and lit it with a lighter, then lit the candle. The pact that Keyes and two friends signed committing them to supporting each other in their draft resistance. On May 15, 1964 he was drafted, but declined in a telegram to the President, Attorney General, and the local Draft Board: \\"There is no moral validity to any part of any law whose purpose is to train people to kill one another. I hereby reject the order to report for induction.\\" On May 18, 1964, he and two friends signed a \\"Pact\\" to insist upon joint arrest if any one of them was individually picked up for draft resistance. One was convicted in St. Louis in July 1964 and Keyes and the third man stood up in court and got six months each for contempt. By 1965, draft card burning had become so popular that the U.S. government passed a law making it an offense to knowingly destroy or mutilate a draft card. There had been a draft-card burning event in 1947 when conscription was re- established after World War II, but Keyes was one of the earliest draft card burners of the Vietnam War era. After finishing the contempt sentence, Keyes was sentenced to three years in prison in 1965 for failing to report for military service. He served one year of the sentence. In all, Keyes served four prison sentences for civil disobedience from 1961 - 65 including a 27-day hunger strike in the Albany, Georgia, city jail, Feb. 1964, when an integrated peace march was forbidden to march through the middle of town. In 1966, his mother, Charlotte Keyes wrote about Gene's pacifism and activism culminating in his draft card burning in an article for McCall's Magazine called Suppose They Gave War and Nobody Came. That article gained wide attention and made the title a slogan of the anti-Vietnam war movement. It became a popular bumper sticker. A 1970 anti-war movie adopted the same title and the rock group, The Monkees recorded a song called \\"Zor and Zam\\" based on the idea.  Education and Career  In 1969, Keyes returned to university, completing a Bachelor of Arts, 1971, with a Special Major in Government (War-Peace Studies) at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale. He wrote the first senior thesis of the President's Scholar Program (on unarmed military forces). He stayed at SIU-C for an MA in Government, 1973. Keyes had been a fan of legendary architect, futurist, philosopher and designer of the geodesic dome, Buckminster Fuller, since 1961 and he chose Southern Illinois University at Carbondale largely because Fuller was affiliated with its design department. One of his interests was Fuller's Dymaxion Map, an attempt to show in a flat projection \\"all continents uninterrupted and with minimal distortion\\". Keyes viewed geography as a way of illuminating war and his 1973 Master's thesis looked at a conflict between Russia and China over a tiny island on their river border, a conflict that almost led to a nuclear war. He called the thesis \\"Six Principles for a Unified Map System (Applied to the China-Russia Situation)\\". In it Keyes used Fuller's map as the basis of the new system he proposed. In 1978 he got his Ph.D. in International Relations from York University, Toronto. Upon graduation, Keyes remained in Canada as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Brandon University, Manitoba from 1979-1980 and from 1990-1991. He taught at St. Thomas University, New Brunswick from 1982-1983. He also free lanced. Keyes kept his US citizenship. As a political science professor, Keyes continued to promote the idea of an unarmed military and wrote extensively on the subject. He also pursued an interest in the international second language Esperanto and in world map design.  The Cahill-Keyes Projection  Following his M.A. thesis, Keyes had concluded there were inadequacies with Fuller's map. Further studies later in 1973 led him to discover Bernard J.S. Cahill's Octahedral Butterfly World Map. Created in 1909, Cahill's map had been largely forgotten, but Keyes judged it to be a better map than Fuller's, and he spent much of the next forty years tweaking and improving upon it. Gene Keyes with the hand drawn first draft of the Cahill-Keyes world map Cahill's map looked like a butterfly, but it had some anomalies Keyes did not like. In a eureka moment he realized he wasn't confined to Cahill's butterfly shape. So he redesigned it into an M shape. He also coined the term \\"geocell\\" to define an area bounded by one degree of latitude and longitude, because he felt that world maps should have a resolution of at least five degrees and preferably one degree; whereas most world maps and globes do not. While working on his doctorate in Toronto, he also continued to work on his map. \\"I was unable to locate large-scale reproductions, drawings, or computations,\\" he wrote, \\"so I set about drawing my own Cahill from scratch\\". \\"On November 4th, 1975, after 40-days and nights,\\" notes an article in Wired Magazine on Keyes' forty year quest, \\"he emerged with a six-and-a-half square foot, hand-drawn, featureless graticule\\". A graticule is a network of lines or a grid (latitudes and longitudes) on which a map can be projected. He sketched in North America and eventually the whole world. That 1975 map, the first Cahill-Keyes projection, launched a decades long quest to perfect it. One of his goals is a map with a 1:1 million scale, about half the size of a football field. Each one degree geocell would be large enough to stand in. While the physical Master Map as he calls it, remains a dream, in 2010, his partner Mary Jo Gra√ßa, using Keyes's extensive calculations, plotted the entire projection and in 2011 digitized the entire map. Absent the physical version, a 9,000 square foot pdf of that full size map can be easily navigated on a home computer. It is the first contiguous world map at a resolution showing all one-degree geocells (except five degrees at the poles). Keyes likewise commissioned the first-ever one- degree globe from Joe Roubal in 2013. Ironically, Keyes ever only took one course in cartography (auditing), with most of his studies being in political science.

Cartography Awards  Gene Keyes holding the world's first one-degree globe. This won an honorable mention at the 2013 CaGIS Awards. Keyes and Roubal's one-degree globe won Honorable Mention at the 41st Annual CaGIS Map Design Competition (Cartography and Geographic Information Society). In 2014, Duncan Webb published a five-foot wall poster Cahill-Keyes map, which won Best Map, Other Category, in the 42nd Annual CaGIS Competition.  Esperanto  In 1980, Keyes learned Esperanto. The international second language created by Ludovik Zamenhof was originally published as a pamphlet in several languages in 1887, and for the first time since then, Keyes re-published the English version both on paper and online. Keyes also wrote and uploaded a free HTML edition of a romantic comedy s-f novel (La Mi-Klono, The Me Clone), with English and Esperanto in side-by-side columns. He has also translated eleven Christmas Carols into Esperanto, including a new English version of \\"O Holy Night\\", and an unabridged one of \\"Riu Riu Chiu\\"; all of them with a simple melody score and the original language plus English. As well, Keyes catalogued the nearly 2,000 item Esperanto library of the late Dr. Stevens Norvell, now housed in Alberta.  Strategic Nonviolent Defense and Unarmed Military Forces  Keyes's 1978 Ph.D. thesis was Strategic Nonviolent Defense in Theory; Denmark in Practice. A condensed version appeared in The Journal of Strategic Studies as Strategic Nonviolent Defense: the Construct of an Option. In this work, he identifies morale as the center of gravity for a country non- violently resisting an invasion by an enemy. The latest version of Keyes's long-term interest in a nonviolent military was published as a chapter in the book Nonkilling Security and the State, Jo√°m Evans Pim, ed., 2013 and as an illustrated stand-alone pdf, To Give Life: A Nonkilling Military: Precedents and Possibilities. In it, he elaborates ten kinds of missions for unarmed forces, including such obvious ones as Humanitarian Assistance / Disaster Relief (HA/DR), and hypothetical ones such as Defense in the spirit of Brazil's great national hero, Major-General C√¢ndido Mariano da Silva Rondon (1865-1958), who fostered the motto \\"Die if you must, but never kill.\\" An earlier edition appeared in 1982 in Co-Evolution Quarterly (later Whole Earth Review), as Force Without Firepower.  Shared Parenting Advocate  After Keyes lost his battle for shared-custody of his children in 1984, he led a shared parenting advocacy group in Nova Scotia. In 1998 he testified on shared parenting before Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access of the Government of Canada. \\"I think that situation, where 60,000 children a year are forcibly denied any kind of equal parenting time with their fathers, is one of the worst state-enforced abuses of human rights in Canada today,\\" he told the committee. \\"The court ordeals we go through are sickening and unbelievable. Abusive lawyers are rewarded by adversarial, winner-take-all courts. We have debtors' prison for fathers only. We have children moved away at the mother's whim. We have shattered families, devastated fathers, and scarred children. These are the dark ages of family law in Canada.\\" Keyes submitted a 17-page brief called Family Rights for Children of Divorce, a document his Nova Scotia advocacy had created.

History  Maria Teresa Cucchiari. The congregation was founded in Rome by Trinitarian tertiaries Maria Teresa Cucchiari, Mariana Rizzoti and Anna Reina. Guided by Fr. F√©lix of Jesus and Mary, a Spanish Trinitarian living at San Carlino alle Quattro Fontane, they accepted the invitation from Cardinal Marcantonio Colonna to establish a school in Avezzano (Aquila) for catechizing and imparting some basic education to poor girls of the region. They were invested with the full habit of the Trinitarian Discalced nuns on September 8, 1762, and took the names of Maria Teresa of the Most Holy Trinity, Marianna of the Holy Redeemer and Maria Felice of the Holy Spirit, respectively. The juridical journey that transformed these Sisters into a pontifical institute is somewhat convoluted. Initially, they were tertiaries who went by the name of Maestre Pie dell'Ordine dei Trinitari Scalzi del Riscatto (Pious Teachers the Order of the Discalced Trinitarians of the Ransom). They made no novitiate, took no canonical vows and were not bound to the recitation of the Divine Office. They wore the habit of the Discalced Trinitarian nuns but not the sandals. Their houses, called ritiri (retreat houses), did not keep the strict papal cloister, were autonomous and had no superior general. Their rule and Constitutions were broadly based on those of the Discalced Trinitarian nuns and were occasionally modified by the Congregation's directors or local bishops. In 1771, Fr. Nicol√°s of the Virgin, a Spanish Trinitarian residing at St. Carlino, drafted their first Constitutions, which introduced the optional profession of religious vows and gave the Maestre Pie a superior general. She was to be elected for a lifetime term by the bishops of the dioceses where the Maestre had houses or could be appointed by the bishop of the diocese where the previous superior general had resided. In conformity with these Constitutions, Sr. Maria Teresa Cucchiari was the first superior general. She professed her vows in the cathedral of Avezzano on October 10, 1772, and governed the congregation until her death on June 10, 1801.  Organization  The congregation is a pontifical institute whose purpose is the glorification of the Most Holy Trinity and the Christian education of young girls. The Trinitarian Sisters of Rome are headed by the Superior General and the congregation's general council; these officers serve six-year terms; the Superior General and the members of the general council are elected by the Chapter General, which meets every six years or upon the death of the Superior General. Each local Trinitarian community is headed by a superior, called a Superior, who is appointed to a three-year term and can be renewed for a second three-year term. The current Superior General of the Trinitarian Sisters of Rome is Mother Maria Clotilde Testa S.T.  Distribution  In 2013, the Trinitarian sisters of Rome was 292 and had 29 houses: 16 in Italy, 4 in the United States, 8 in Madagascar and 1 in Philippines. Their headquarters is at Via della Madonna del Riposo 71, 00165 Rome, Italy.

This is done most of the time by adding inflectional suffixes denoting a female (such as the standard suffix -ess in English, or its equivalent -a in Spanish). In some languages with grammatical gender, for example Dutch, there is a tendency to assign the feminine gender to certain ‚Äì in particular abstract ‚Äì nouns which are originally masculine or neuter. This also happened to some words in Middle English (which, in contrast to Modern English, had grammatical gender) which denoted virtue and vice. In Modern English, in spite of it being a gender-neutral language, certain non-human things that are usually neuter are still sometimes feminized by way of figure of speech, especially countries and ships (see also , ). Feminization is also related to neutralization, which is the process of replacing masculine forms of words (i.e. policeman) with gender-unmarked forms (i.e. police officer). Not to be confused with Feminization (sociology), though the two subjects are deeply inter-related. Hostess is the feminized form of the masculine \\"host\\".  In feminist theory  Recent efforts to modify the use of the generic masculine have generated controversy and debate. Feminists believe the use of the generic masculine to refer to someone who's gender is unknown erases women and should be abolished. Furthermore, some see evidence of the intentional preference of the masculine over the feminine. It has been argued that 17th century grammaticians who wanted to assert male dominance worked to suppress the feminine forms of certain professions, leading to the modern-day rule that prefers the masculine over the feminine in the French language. There are a number of arguments against such prescriptive rules however. In France, the Prime Minister at the time, Edouard Philippe, announced a ban on the use of gender-neutral French in official government documentation, arguing that implementing it would complicate education and create little change in the social structure that activists are seeking to change. In response, Minister of Education Jean-Michel Blanquer also tweeted his opinion on the use of inclusive language, saying that ‚Äúlanguage is a bedrock of life that we owe to children‚Äù and that it ‚Äúmust not be instrumentalized, even for the best of causes.‚Äù Research has also shown that, despite the inclusion of feminization to make language more gender equal, possible side effects can affect affect the recruitment process. Feminine job titles also affect the evaluation of female applications to job positions. Moreover, conservative political attitudes have been linked to a greater devaluation of female applicants with feminine titles compared to liberal attitudes. Additionally, some argue that feminization may be detrimental because feminine suffixes carry negative connotations. For example, a study found that women who were referred to as professoressa were seen as less persuasive than either a man or women who used the title professore (Italian for the feminine and masculine forms of \\"professor,\\" respectively.\\") Another reason feminized language may carry poor conceptions is because many efforts to feminize language are recent and therefore have not yet been accepted by the mass public. Feminized language may thus be used as a way to devalue a woman, especially a working professional (which is so often subject to feminization), by those who seek to prescribe traditional social orders to others.  Feminization in various languages = French  Double gender marking has been demonstrated typographically using the masculine form as the baseline, and then adding a period or hyphen followed by the feminine suffix, such as fier.√®re.s or fier- √®re-s. Double gender marking is prevalent in radical political pamphlets and manifestos. This is difficult to track, however, as these types of publications are written by many groups and tend to be published by organizations that don't keep detailed records of their activities. It has been argued that, due to World War I and the gap in traditional male professions that women were required to fill, many words for professions developed feminine variations. Since then, there has been considerable debate about codifying these changes. Attempts in France to enact changes in language inclusivity have generated considerable pushback. The French Academy, a prominent council on the French language, has stated that codifying procedures like language feminization would engender ‚Äúa disunited language, disparate in its expression, creating a confusion that borders on illegibility.‚Äù  Italian  Female members of a profession can be referred to with the masculine ending -e (eg. presidente) or the feminine -essa (eg. presidentessa). A 2001 study by Mucchi-Faina and Barro showed that women professionals are more persuasive when using the masculine ending while a 2012 study by Merkel et al. show there was no difference in perception.  Russian  Noun declension is asymmetrical in Russian. Women can be referred to with suffixes of the first or second declension but men can only be referred to with first declension suffixes.  German  Man is commonly used to mean 'one' and is frequently used in general statements. It is similar to English indefinite \\"you\\" or \\"one.\\" Feminine job titles are usually created by adding -in to the grammatically masculine word in question. Informatiker (singular or plural). The feminine form is Informatikerin (singular) and Informatikerinnen (plural).  Polish  A study of the feminized form of diarolog, known as diarolo≈ºka (feminine) found that feminization lead to disadvantageous effects for female applicants. Applicants with a feminized job title were evaluated disadvantageously compared to male applicants and female applicants who retained the masculine form of the job title.

He introduced the publication of major choral works such as masses with orchestra, as well as organ music, concentrating on German and French Romantic organ music. During the 1990s, additional genres such as solo songs and works for organ and other instruments or orchestra.

In 2002, the complete organ catalogue of the Belgian publisher √âditions Chantraine was added, which includes the recorded improvisations by the organist at Notre Dame de Paris, Pierre Cochereau.

Biography He was born in London, the son of by his first wife, the Englishwoman Henrietta Jane Speed. His father and grandfather served as diplomats of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1776 he joined the chevau-l√©gers of Savoy and in 1789 went to England to serve as equerry to the Duke of Gloucester, a post he would hold until 1792.R. G. Thorne, SPEED, Henry alias DE VIRY, Fran√ßois Joseph Marie Henri, Baron de la Perri√®re (1766-1820) in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790-1820 (1986). On 24 October 1789, under the name Henry Speed and despite his father's disapproval, he was married to Augusta Montagu, a natural daughter of the Earl of Sandwich; they would go on to have four sons (including ) and a daughter. The following year he was elected to Parliament for Huntingdon through Sandwich's influence, and he was made a member of Brooks's in 1791. He never spoke in Parliament and last attended in 1794. In July 1795 he fled while on trial for fraud in the Court of King's Bench, and in December, having taken refuge in the Isle of Man, he pleaded parliamentary privilege after being arrested for debt by a Liverpool merchant. He was not re-elected in 1796. In 1798 he was made a lieutenant in the Isle of Man Volunteers, and was promoted to captain in the 1st Battalion in 1803. Speed's father had supported Napoleon Bonaparte, and so had retained his estates at Viry, which passed to his son in 1813. The comte de Viry returned to France on the Bourbon restoration, and on 22 August 1815 was elected deputy for Mont- Blanc. In the chamber he supported the ultra-royalist majority. He was not elected again in 1816, by which time Mont-Blanc had been restored to the Duchy of Savoy.

The Headmaster is Andrew McCleave (since 2018). Ballard School offers scholarships and bursaries, and does not require an entrance exam for admission The school regularly holds Open Mornings for prospective pupils and parents.  History  Ballard School was founded as the Royal Naval School by William Higgs Colborne and James Cruickshank at Lee-on-the-Solent in August 1895. Great Ballard House was designed by Sydney Kelway Pope M.S.A, a local Southampton architect. One of the first pupils was named Trevor John Tatham. He joined the school as a teacher in 1916 and remained until his death in 1952. Around 1905, the Royal Navy requested that the name be changed and so it was renamed as Edinburgh House School. James Cruickshank married his partner's daughter Louisa in 1901. The school remained at premises in Manor Way, Lee-on-the-Solent throughout the first World War. In 1906, Louisa gave birth to Stuart Colborne Cruickshank, a future headmaster of Edinburgh House School. Following the deaths of both William and James, Louisa became joint Principal with her son Stuart. Early in the 1930s, two teachers who were to play a major part in the post war development of the school joined Edinburgh House School. They were Edward (Ted) Kingsley Kefford and David William Hutchinson (Hutch) When the 2nd World War began, the school left Lee-on-the-Solent, moving first to Wellington, Somerset and then in 1942 to Brightwell Baldwin, Oxfordshire. In 1936, Ted had married Evelyn Burt, a New Milton girl. After the War, it was decided that the school would not move back to Lee-on-the-Solent. Ted learned that Great Ballard Estate in New Milton was on the market for sale. With the large Arts and Craft house, vegetable garden and about 40 acres of land it was ideal for use as a school. As neither he nor Stuart Cruickshank could raise the capital to purchase, Ted negotiated a lease and the school took occupation in January 1946. Great Ballard House was built in 1904 by John Arnold Ubsdell (2nd) and his wife Genevieve Ann (n√©e Eads). In 1924, the house and estate had been leased to a newly formed school named ‚ÄòGreat Ballard School‚Äô. This school remained in occupation until 1940, when it moved to Clayesmore School in Iwerne Minster, Dorset before moving first to Stowell Park Gloucestershire, then Camberley Surrey and finally to Eartham West Sussex. ‚ÄòTed‚Äô Kefford was Headmaster of Edinburgh House until his retirement in July 1969. Earlier in that year discussions with the Headmasters of Gorse Cliff and Marchwood Park Schools led to them merging with Edinburgh House School in September 1969. The new Principal was the Rev. Ian Watson who remained in post until 1973. Extensive improvements to facilities were completed in 1970. Rev R. Drown was the next Headmaster (1973-1984) and in 1980/81 a ¬£72,000 Development Plan was announced. Mr. J. Quibell-Smith (1984-1988) was next in post and put strong emphasis on the welfare of the pupils as well as their education and of the school being a happy place. Next came Mr A.R. Leighton (1988-1995) and a further development programme was carried out in the early 1990s. In September 1995 Mr Leighton oversaw the merger of Edinburgh House School with Fernhill Manor the adjoining girls school. The larger school was named Ballard School.  Academics  Ballard School provides education for four key groups. Ballard School Pre-Prep consists of Nursery, Reception and Year 2. Lower Prep consists of KS2 year 3, 4 and 5. Upper Prep consists of KS2 year 6 and KS3 year 7 and 8. Senior consists of year 9, 10 and 11.

Beck is also known for music compositions for Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch short movies, an award- winning introduction trailer StarCraft: Legacy of the Void, and various trailers for Battlefield by EA Games. In 2016 Beck founded his own company, Epic Music Productions, which was focused on creating soundtrack compositions for both the gaming and the film industry. In 2018 Beck founded Beat Games with Jan Ilavsky and Vladimir Hrincar, the company behind viral VR game Beat Saber which is the first virtual reality game to sell one million copies.  Life and career = Early life  Jaroslav was born in the town of Strakonice in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. He was first introduced to music at the age of six when he started to learn how to play the flute. He soon realized that he doesn't enjoy reproducing what someone else already composed as it gave him no freedom and he started to create his own sounds. At the age of 14, he started flying gliders. A year later, he successfully completed the training and obtained a pilot license. This turned out to be an important step towards music since it gave him the confidence he needed and it later helped him to make the decision to leave his comfort zone and pursue music full-time. In 2003 he started to study secondary technical school in Strakonice and began to work as DJ at the same time. To follow the family tradition, he entered University of West Bohemia in 2007 and studied at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering until he quit in 2012.  Dj career  At the age of fifteen, he discovered electronic music for the first time. A major step in this direction was the legendary techno festival in Roudnice nad Labem with Carl Cox as the headliner. He instantly fell in love with electronic music. His first gig was a techno rave in the town of Vimperk in 2007 called ‚ÄúDemolition‚Äù where he performed under his own name. After Vimperk he started touring around clubs and festivals in the Czech Republic. After the ‚ÄúApokalypsa‚Äù show in Brno, he changed his stage name to Jay Beck and he started to lean towards progressive house. He had the opportunity to perform in the most desired clubs in the Czech Republic alongside both Czech and foreign DJs. He has performed at Summer of Love (Pardubice), M√°ch√°ƒç (Machovo Jezero), Apokalypsa (Brno), Duplex (Prague), and elsewhere. During his DJ career, he also produced his own electronic music, mostly Progressive and Electro House and he tried to discover his own style.  Oxford  In 2012, he quit the University of West Bohemia and went to Oxford to study Audio Production at SAE Institute. In Oxford, he changed his DJ stage name to ‚ÄúSqeepo‚Äù and he started leaning towards an electronic music style called ‚ÄúDubstep‚Äù. During his studies at SAE, he spent most of the time in a studio composing music under his Sqeepo identity. He also composed music for a number one Slovak singer Krist√≠na. He successfully graduated with honours from Oxford's SAE in 2014 obtaining a BSc. (Bachelor of Science) degree.  Trailer music production  In 2013 he joined forces with a friend, visual effects artist Pavel Kacerle. Jaroslav created sound effects and composed original music to Pavel's demo reel for Iron Man 3 which later turned out to be a major step towards his current career. Thanks to a music he made for the demo reel, he got noticed overseas and while still in Oxford, he got his first work offer to remix music to EA Games' Battlefield Hardline trailer in 2014. After that, more work offers followed and Jaroslav began to work on trailers for both movies and games full-time. After Battlefield Hardline, he worked on Battlefield 4 Final Stand and one more Battlefield Hardline. After that he started to cooperate with Blizzard Entertainment as well, his first trailer was Heroes of the Storm in 2015 followed by StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void where Jaroslav remixed an original StarCraft music. In 2016 he won a G.A.N.G. Award for the Best Cinematic / Cutscene Audio as a part of the team that stood behind the StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void introduction trailer. He also cooperated with Joshua Crispin a.k.a. Generdyn on music which was used for Terminator Genisys TV spot in 2015 and for Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens TV spot. In 2016 he collaborated on music composition for Blizzard's ‚ÄúOverwatch‚Äù short movies (Alive, Hero, Dragons) and he started to collaborate with Cliff Bleszinski's company BossKey on trailers and soundtracks for a new game ‚ÄúLawBreakers‚Äù.  Epic Music Productions  Jaroslav founded Epic Music Productions in 2016. The company focuses on modern cinematic music production mainly for trailers and soundtracks for both the music and the gaming industry. The company's specialty is the production of the complete audio content for new games from the soundtrack, through sound design to sound for trailers alone. Their clients are from all over the world, mainly from the USA. In the future they are planning to focus on virtual reality audio projects and also on new audio hardware development to innovate sound for soundtracks as such. Jaroslav also produced many of the tracks featured in the 2018 virtual reality rhythm game Beat Saber.  Beat Games  The company was established in early 2018 with Jan Ilavsky and Vladimir Hrincar (game developers). An indie game studio, based in Prague, in the Czech Republic. Founders of the company are creators of the hit VR game Beat Saber. The future vision of Beat Games is mainly to focus on completing Beat Saber to make it the best game which will define the starting era in VR.

The 273rd episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 26, 2016. The episode lampooned the cyberattack affecting the East Coast, progressed the plot of the previous episodes and also echoed the season's previous commentary on nostalgia, trolling and Internet anonymity. Plot In the aftermath of Gerald Broflovski and his Internet troll friend Dildo Schwaggins' successful trolling of Denmark, Schwaggins brings his team over to the Broflovskis' house to celebrate. However, despite having become obsessed with trolling, Gerald is annoyed that the trolls want their relationship with him to continue and grow, causing him to angrily rebuff Schwaggins' repeated attempts to build a real friendship. Heidi Turner and Cartman show Kyle a bulletin board in Heidi's room, where she deduced through emoji analysis that Skankhunt42 was actually a parent of one of the students, although she never found out his identity before she was forced to go offline. Using Heidi's methods, the Danes activate their troll identification website known as Troll Trace and target one of the troll team's members in the city of Fort Collins, Colorado, publicizing all of its citizens' Internet histories in the process. As the city collapses from the chaos, the troll from Fort Collins is burned alive by the father of one of his victims. When Gerald discovers that the Danes are close to finding him out, he panics and begs Schwaggins for help, but Schwaggins rejects Gerald for spurning his friendship. When Cartman visits Kyle to try to get him to apologize for supposedly offending Heidi for not being funny, Kyle openly suggests that he would use Troll Trace to reveal Cartman's bigoted past and send the information to Heidi. Cartman lies to Heidi about his past, specifically about his negative reaction to the female cast of the Ghostbusters remake, but despite her reassurances, he worries that she will eventually find out. Randy Marsh and Mr. Garrison discover that they cannot kill off the member berries, which are using their nostalgia-inducing abilities to influence the public to vote for Garrison over Hillary Clinton. Clinton's aides are also concerned about the possible release of her Internet activities due to Troll Trace, and they suggest that only Skankhunt42 can help her. Randy convinces Garrison to make one final speech \\"from the heart\\" to convince his followers to support Clinton. However, the member berries have become intelligent themselves and they attempt to counter Garrison's sabotage by infesting his running mate Caitlyn Jenner.

She had to join Nazi youth organisations and spent a year doing compulsory labour in harsh conditions. After the war things remained difficult for some time and she studied Chinese while waiting for Frankfurt University to reopen in 1947. However, she had always been interested in the antiquities collected by her maternal great- grandfather, the sculptor and art historian , and had a long-standing wish to study classical archaeology, and in particular, Etruscology.

The former head master of the Nansen Academy, Inge Eidsv√•g, visited the rehabilitation ward for war injuries of the Kosovo Hospital in Sarajevo in 1994, and this visit triggered the idea of the Nansen Dialogue Project. \\"I visited the rehabilitation ward for war injuries of the Kosovo Hospital in Sarajevo in 1994. This was before the Dayton Agreement and at the time Sarajevo was under siege. The five days I spent there made a big impression on me, and as soon as I was back in Norway I got in touch with the Norwegian Red Cross and the Norwegian Church Aid to suggest a joint project called \\"Democracy, Human Rights and Peaceful Conflict Handling\\", to which they agreed. A few weeks later on we had worked out a temporary program and applied for financial support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They decided to offer their support and later on the Peace Research Institute (PRIO) was invited to join in. In September 1995 we were able to welcome the first group of students from the former Yugoslavia. Within a year we had turned an idea into reality.\\" At first the project consisted solely of dialogue seminars in Lillehammer, but the participants felt that even if the dialogue seminars were helpful as they were the fact that only a privileged few could participate made it less successful than it could have been, given another structure. A Serbian and an Albanian woman who'd participated in the seminars decided to set up a Nansen Dialogue Center in Pristina in 1997. They set up dialogue seminars and invited both Albanians and Serbs from Kosovo to participate, and kept it up until the spring of 1999, when NATO bombs falling over Yugoslavia and Kosovo put a temporary end to them. The Center re-opened in 2000, and that year additional centers were opened in Podgorica, Skopje and Beograd. During the fall new Centers opened in Bosnia ‚Äì Herzegovina, Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka, and in 2001 in Osijek and Mestrovic. In 2005 the Bujanovac Center opened. Today there are 10 Dialogue Centers employing more than 60 people. They work with dialogue between ethnic groups who have previously been at war. More than 150 separate dialogue seminars between former enemies from conflicted areas has been held at the Nansen Academy premises, and it is still possible to attend workshops in Lillehammer. In addition to working with the former Yugoslavia the Nansen Center for Peace and Dialogue has expanded their efforts to include participants from other conflicted areas, such as the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa. Steinar Bryn is in charge of the project. Nansen Dialogue was merged with the Norwegian Peace Centre in 2010 into a new entity called the Nansen Center for Peace and Dialogue. The Norwegian Peace Centre was founded in 1988, and the main focus of the establishment was to create a venue for peace work, such as workshops, seminars and courses in peace work and human rights.

Description  The diocesan museum of Gallipoli was officially inaugurated on July 12, 2004 through an initiative by the Italian Episcopal Conference (Conferenza Episcopale Italiana, CEI), the Diocese of Nard√≤-Gallipoli, and the community of the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Agatha of Gallipoli, with assistance from the European Union and the Italian region of Apulia. The idea to open a diocesan museum originated with then-bishop, Aldo Garzia, and was developed by his successors. The impressive architecture is found at the historic center of Gallipoli at the most important point of the old city. The museum occupies space inside the old palazzo of Gallipoli's seminary which is adjacent to the Cathedral Basilica whose construction began in 1750. The structure has substantially preserved its original look and, with the numerous Baroque decorations, covers 900 square meters laid out on three floors. The museum contains 553 objects, including liturgical metal works, vestments, miters, pastoral and pectoral crosses, numerous portraits, bronze bells, ceramics decorated with coats of arms of all the bishops of the diocese, and works of Gian Domenico Catalano. All of these objects come from the cathedral, the curia, and the bishop's residence. The old chapel on the second floor houses two gold and silver statues of Saint Agatha and Saint Sebastian, made in Napoli and originally owned by the comune. The statue of Saint Agatha (patron of the diocese and the city, as well as of the cathedral) \\" ‚Ä¶ was brought to Gallipoli on June 10, 1760 aboard xebecs at the expense and for the devotion of Msgr. Serafino Brancon and was given to Vicar General Fr. Carlo Zaccaria\\". Also found here are a baldacchino of S.E.R. Msgr. Oronzo Filomarini, precious liturgical vestments, and a 16th-century copy of the Holy Shroud, one of only five in existence (donated by bishop Sebastiano Quintiero Ortiz and made in direct contact with the original in Torino). A silver reliquary, containing a piece of the True Cross, is decorated the coat of arms of bishop Alessio Zelodano.  Curial archives of Gallipoli  Next to the diocesan museum and inside the space of the cathedral are the curial archives of Gallipoli, made up of about 4310 archival units. These contain archives and historical works from the 16th century to the present. Unfortunately, no document before 1500 has survived, since everything prior was destroyed by the Venetians in the historic battle of 1484. The archives include manuscripts related to pastoral visits, diocesan synods, bishops, excommunications, criminal trials, marriages, curial legislation, parishes, confraternities and monasteries, ordinations, patrimonies, charity, and private oratories.

Works  From 1928, L√©on Homo published a number of popular books for an educated public addressing Roman history as a whole, and the relations between the Empire and Christianity.

Its leader was Giovanni Monchiero. The CI were demoted to sub-group in July 2017 for lack of members. In August 2017 the sub-group was officially named Civics and Innovators for Italy, while in November 2017 it took the name of Civics and Innovators ‚Äì Energies for Italy,http://www.camera.it/leg17/217?idlegislatura=17&idGruppo;=1589&idGruppoMisto;=&tipoVis;=#modifiche after that some of its members joined Energies for Italy (EpI). History=Background The group, which was formed by dissidents from Civic Choice (SC) in October 2016, was actually not new. In fact, until then it had been the official group of the party, which was launched by Mario Monti in the run- up of the 2013 general election and had later suffered several splits, including that of Monti, who returned to his independent status of senator for life. Most notably, in mid 2016 SC was divided on the prospect of forming a joint group with Denis Verdini's Liberal Popular Alliance (ALA), as proposed by new party leader Enrico Zanetti.http://www.corriere.it/politica/16_marzo_02/verdini-contro-alfano- battaglia-centri-matteo-renzi- regia-5f1df4a2-dff7-11e5-86bb-b40835b4a5ca.shtmlhttp://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/02/29/denis- verdini-il-vice-ministro-zanetti-meglio-lui-che-alfano-la-sinistra-pd-vuole- solo- ricattare/2504863/http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2016/05/30/news/alla- camera-scatta-l-operazione-verdini-in-maggioranza-coi-montiani-di-scelta- civica-1.268294 In July, after that the majority of the party's deputies had come in opposition of an alliance with ALA, Zanetti led four deputies (later joined by a fifth) out of the parliamentary group. Contextually, Zanetti, who pretended to be still the leader of SC, started to organise a joint group with the ALA and others. The party's national board finally sided with Zanetti later that month,http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/07/28/scelta-civica- colpo-di-scena-in-direzione-passa-linea-zanetti-pro-verdini-ma-e-polemica- impedito-di-votare/2941029/http://www.agenparl.com/scelta-civica-direzione- nazionale-conferma-zanetti-segretario-avanti-processo-aggregazione-area- liberal-democratica/ and the national assembly did the same in October, with 63 votes in favour and 39 against.http://www.sceltacivica.it/doc/1986/assemblea-nazionale-rinnova- fiducia-a-zanetti-si-a-nuovo-gruppo-parlamentare.htm This caused the final break-up of the party and the formation of two different parliamentary groups.http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2016/10/12/news/monti_nome_scelta_civica-149633270/http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2016/10/12/news/scelta- civica-zanetti-vince-la-battaglia-sul-nome-e-verdini-entra-in- maggioranza-1.285664http://formiche.net/2016/10/13/verdini-zanetti-monti- renzi/ Formation and early months The SC group eventually changed name into \\"Civics and Innovators\\" on 12 October 2016.

As of February 2017, the political alignment of group members was however heterogeneous. While the group leadership was keen on an alliance with the Democrats and Antimo Cesaro was confirmed undersecretary of Culture by Gentiloni,http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2016/12/29/news/nominati_i_sottosegretari_ma_non_assegnate_alcune_deleghe-155059421/ an increasing number of deputies was turning against the government. For instance, in January Vargiu, who had been elected in representation of the centre-right Sardinian Reformers, and Matarrese, a former president of SC, participated in the founding convention of Direction Italy (DI), a conservative party launched by Raffaele Fitto and built on the experience of the Conservatives and Reformists.http://formiche.net/2017/01/29/direzione- italia-ecco-idee-e-alleati-del-nuovo-partito-thatcheriano-di-raffaele-fitto Others (Gianfranco Librandi, Andrea Mazziotti and Stefano Dambruoso) took part, along with Mario Monti, Francesco Rutelli, Emma Bonino and the Italian Radicals, Carlo Scognamiglio and The Liberals, to a pro-Europeanist event organised by Benedetto Della Vedova (undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, former Radical and SC member) in February.http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2017/02/11/forza- europa_n_14690928.htmlhttps://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/499815/forza-europa From the event, titled Forza Europa! (Forward Europe!), Della Vedova would launch a movement and later a party named Forza Europa (FE). Continuation as a sub-group In June 2017 Giovanni Palladino, one of the group's left- wingers, left in order to join the PD,http://www.agenparl.com/pd-palladino- lascia-civici-innovatori-aderisce-ai-dem-domani-presentazione-rosato- tartaglione-bonavitacola-casillo while right-wingers Vargiu and Matarrese switched to DI.http://www.barilive.it/news/politica/508501/matarrese-passa- con-fittohttp://www.linkiesta.it/it/article/2017/07/01/la-legislatura-sta-per- finire-in-parlamento-e-partita-la-corsa-a-cambi/34779 As a result, on 10 July the group was demoted to sub-group within the Mixed Group for lack of members.http://www.lasicilia.it/news/politica/92884/gruppo-ci-sara-sciolto- dal-10-luglio.html Later in July, another left-leaning deputy, Librandi, left the CI in order to join the PD,http://www.affaritaliani.it/politica/palazzo- potere/gianfranco-librandi-passa-al-pd-492571.html reducing the sub-group's total to twelve deputies. Among its members, Menorello and Monchiero were increasingly involved with the centre-right Energies for Italy (EpI).http://formiche.net/blog/2017/07/12/cattolici-progetto- parisihttp://www.lospiffero.com/ls_article.php?id=34666 As a result, in November the sub-group changed its name into \\"Civics and Innovators ‚Äì Energies for Italy\\". In December Menorello and Monchiero were appointed by EpI's president Stefano Parisi to the party's political secretariat.http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/politica/13290597/epi-parisi- costituita-segreteria-politica- movimento.htmlhttp://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/parisi-presenta-squadra- sacconi-e-albertini-nel-pool-1474324.html While EpI members were close to the centre-right coalition, the rest of the group, particularly those who joined to FE and subsequently formed More Europe (+Eu) with the Italian Radicals, part of the centre-left coalition led by Matteo Renzi and the PD in the 2018 general election.

The last pair of legs are flattened and can be rotated in a propeller like manner allowing the crab to swim in any direction. The maximum length is 17 cm. Distribution Charybdis natator is found throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans from eastern South Africa and Madagascar north to the Red Sea and across the Indian Ocean, including the Mascarene Islands and the Seychelles, to the western pacific where it extends north to Japan and south to northern Australia including Lord Howe Island. Biology Charybdis natator is a benthic species found in the inter-tidal zone and in the sub -tidal zone down to a depth of 60m and over a variety of substrates, including sandy or silty bottoms, rocky and coral reefs and beds of weed. It prefers to hide under rocks or stones. It is uncommon throughout its range, normally making uo less than 2% of the numbers of crabs sampled. In the Red Sea females with eggs have been found throughout the year, although there is a peak between May and September. The eggs hatch 11‚Äì15 days after being extruded and there is a period of 7 days between the larvae hatching and the extrusion of the next brood. Fecundity is 181,000 to 961,00 eggs for each spawning and each female can spawn three times per mature phase which means that this is a rather fecund species. In most populations spawning occurs twice a year. The larvae have six zoeae stages and a megalopa stage and from the first zoeae stage to megalopa takes 28‚Äì44 days. Human Use Charybdis natator is an unimportant species for fisheries in eastern Africa and in India it is the fourth most important swimming crab caught in the crab fishery whereas in Taiwan and Australia it is much more important. Because of the high rate of meat recovery C. natator may be suitable for aquaculture. Etymology & taxonomy The generic name, Charybdis, refers to a whirlpool in Greek while the specific name natator references its swimming ability. It was named as Cancer natator in 1794 by the German zoologist Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst. There are two subspecies: * Charybdis natator natator (Herbst 1794): the continental form * Charybdis natator seychellensis Crosnier, 1984: the Seychelles References Category:Portunoidea Category:Crustaceans described in 1794 ","title":"Charybdis natator"},{"id":"52083351","text":"Uebert Angel (formerly known as Uebert Mudzanire, or Uebert Angel Mudzanire, commonly referred to as Prophet Angel born 6 September 1978) is the founder of Spirit Embassy, a Pentecostal ministry in the United Kingdom.

Built in 1870, it is a fine late example of Greek Revival architecture. It now houses the Huntington Public Library and serves as a community center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The former Huntington Lower Village Church building stands in the rural village center of Huntington, on the west side of Main Road north of its junction with Bridge Street. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A three-stage tower rises from the ridge line behind the front facade. Its first stage is square, with corner pilasters and small cornice and entablature. The second stage is octagonal, with corner pilasters and blind louvered openings on four side. The third stage, which houses the belfry, is a reduced version of the second stage, and is capped by a round cupola. The building's corners have paneled pilasters, which rise to a broad entablature that extends across the front and sides. The main entrance is centered, with flanking paneled pilasters rising to an entablature and cornice. The gable above is fully pedimented, with an applied diamond form at its center. with The church was built in 1870, on the site of an older church built in 1839 for the use of multiple religious organizations. The older building (no longer standing) was moved a short distance to serve as town hall. The present building saw use by religious organizations into the 20th century, its usage gradually declining. Its main hall has since been converted to house the town library, and other spaces are available for community use.

It was built in 1862-63 as a Church of England place of worship for the Woolwich Royal Artillery garrison. The church was hit by a V-1 flying bomb in 1944 and largely destroyed by fire. The restored ruin with its canopied roof, its blue, red and yellow brick walls, its mosaics and a memorial garden is open to the public on Sundays.  Location  The church was built on a triangular plot between Grand Depot Road (part of the A205 or South Circular Road) and Woolwich New Road, its entrance facing the parade ground of the Royal Artillery Barracks on Grand Depot Road. It is surrounded by a small park. On the south side of this park, where the two roads converge, stands the Second Boer War memorial. Both the church and the memorial are part of Woolwich Common conservation area.  History = Construction and embellishment  The first chapel for the Royal Artillery was part of the Royal Artillery Barracks complex at the north end of Woolwich Common. It was built in 1808 and after St George's was built it was converted into a theatre.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 335-336. Church interior in The Illustrated London News, 1863? The idea for building a new garrison church came from Lord Sidney Herbert, the Secretary of State for War. The design of the church is similar to that of T.H. Wyatt's parish church in Wilton, close to the Herbert family seat at Wilton House. Lord Herbert no doubt influenced the choice of style and the architect. In Woolwich, Wyatt was assisted by his younger brother Matthew. The choice of the Wyatt brothers may also have been influenced by the fact that both the nearby Royal Artillery Barracks and the Royal Military Academy were designed by their forebear, James Wyatt. The Wyatt brothers designed a church in the Early Christian/Lombardic Romanesque style with Byzantine influences in the interior. The church was built by the Pimlico builders George Smith and Co. Soon after completion, seating capacity was increased from 1,550 to 1,700. Royal Artillery officers raised money for stained-glass windows and a church organ. Further embellishments consisted of mosaics (1902‚Äì03) and various memorials for deceased artillery men. South of the church an obelisk was erected to the memory of those who fell in the Second Boer War.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 347-348.  Destruction, disrepair and conservation  On 13 July 1944 a V-1 flying bomb hit the church and caused a fire which destroyed the interior. The walls were still more or less intact and a temporary roof was erected. The church however was no longer needed, as the smaller chapel of St Michael and All Angels at the Royal Military Academy proved to be a suitable replacement. Single capital After the war the burned-out church suffered from further neglect and vandalism. In 1952 a rebuilding scheme proposed by the architect Kenneth Lindy failed to gain sufficient support. In 1970 the upper parts of the walls were demolished and a corrugated canopy roof was erected to cover the remainder of the apse. Photos from the 1960s show that the apse windows were still in place then, as well as the upper parts of the columns supporting the chancel arch and parts of the pulpit.Compare photographs 358 and 359 in: Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 349. Also in 1970, a memorial garden was laid out in the roofless nave and aisles. In 1973 the building was listed for its architectural merits, especially its polychromatic Victorian brick, as well as being part of an historic military ensemble and for demonstrating the impact of an aerial assault, reflected in its ruinous state. In 2011 ownership of the site was transferred from Defence Infrastructure Organisation to Heritage of London Trust Operations.Heritage of London Trust Operations on stgeorgeswoolwich.org. Shortly afterwards the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a grant of just under ¬£400,000, towards the total cost of ¬£800,000, for much needed conservation work, including the building of a larger canopy roof over the east end of the church.Royal Garrison Church Woolwich gets new lease of life on hlf.org.uk, 24 October 2011. Since 2016 the church has been run by a local group, the Woolwich Garrison Church Trust.Woolwich Garrison Church Trust on stgeorgeswoolwich.org. Further plans entail restoration of the pulpit and reinstallment of alabaster panels in the apse, which have been kept in storage.Second Phase Conservation Works on stgeorgeswoolwich.org.  Architecture = Exterior  The church's exterior mainly follows the style of the Romanesque Revival. The use of polychromatic brick is typical of the mid-Victorian period. The narthex at the west end was inspired by Romanesque churches in Northern Italy and consists of three porches with Bath stone columns and carved capitals. The two western columns of the central porch are quatrefoil-shaped and of Aberdeen granite. The original west fa√ßade had a rose window and was about four times higher than the remaining part of the narthex. The church was designed as a large basilica with a wide nave and narrow aisles, of which almost nothing remains. The church never had a tower, just a small belfry on the roof of the south aisle, looking slightly out of place. The lower parts of the apse and the east ends of the aisles are reasonably well-preserved.Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 347.

Most of it was lost in the fire or by neglect, but the lower parts of the chancel remain impressive. In the chancel various architectural details, mosaics (see below) and commemorative plaques are present, as well as the original altar and the lower part of the pulpit. Of the once impressive use of iron in the galleried interior almost nothing remains, except for two damaged corbels.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 347-349.

The best-preserved panels show ancient Christian symbols such as vines with grapes, a peacock and a phoenix rising from the flames. A small mosaic of the Lamb of God was saved from the rubble and survives in one of the toilets in the north-west porch. The largest mosaic is a representation of Saint George and the Dragon in the apse. This is a slightly later addition of 1919-20, being part of a memorial to Royal Artillery men who had received the Victoria Cross.Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 348.

As well as the Victoria Cross memorial, several marble plaques commemorating artillery men survive in the apse. One of the columns supporting the arch that separates the chancel and the nave also bears the names of men killed in military conflict up till the Second World War. A plaque inside the church commemorates the designation of the church as a memorial garden, following the V1 flying bomb destruction in July 1944. The memorial garden was first laid out as a lawn in 1970. On the south and north aisle walls, copper plaques are attached with the names of Royal Artillery men killed in action or of natural causes after World War II. On 11 November 2015 a memorial was added by the Royal Borough of Greenwich marking Woolwich's history as a barracks town and commemorating the men and women who served or lived in Woolwich and gave their lives in the service of their country. Included are the names of the victims of the IRA-bombing of the King's Arms in 1974, and fusilier Lee Rigby, who was murdered by Islamic terrorists in Woolwich in 2013.Woolwich remembers on e-shootershill.co.uk, 10 November 2015.Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 350.

In 1942 he received his diploma in chemical analysis from the Instituto Industrial de Lisboa (which later became the Institute Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa. Career Following his time on the continent he returned to S√£o Miguel to begin his professional career, working from the Fabrica de Lactinc√≠nios Loreto. He married on 10 December 1945, in the Church of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, to Berta da Luz Botelho e Silva, daughter of Jos√© Silva and Maria Botelho. He had four children: Jo√£o Manuel, Jos√© Eduardo, Maria Palmira and Rui Jorge. Jos√© Silva, his father-in-law, was an important public figure in Lagoa at the time, and was likely an important influence on Jo√£o Leite's interest in local politics and administration. In fact, for a good part of his life, Jos√© Silva was president of the local municipal council. In 1951, he joined the Uni√£o das F√°bricas A√ßorianos de √Ålcool, as part of the F√°brica do √Ålcool de Lagoa, when he began to work as their chief scientist and chemist. Around the same time, he began to become involved in local politics, joining the municipal council of Lagoa as their Vice- President, during the mandate of Eng. Jaime Sousa Lima. Sometime during this period he had time to travel to Barcelona, to begin a short internship in the area of fermentation, in order to improve his chemical background. He continued his European experience in 1958, with a trip to Belgium, in order to participate in the Brussels Exposition (the first exposition following the Second World War). Following his return, in 1959 he nominated to preside as president of the municipal council of Lagoa, initiating projects to develop the economy and social development of the municipality. But, his tenure was short-lived, and within a year, he abdicated his position to his cousin, Eng. Jo√£o da Mota Amaral. He continued to participate as Vice-President for the next three terms, before leaving politics in 1972. Later life Meanwhile, in January 1964, he became the main property-owner the Fabrica de Cer√¢mica Lima (Lima Ceramics Factory), in order to perpetuate the memory and heritage of his maternal-grandfather, Manuel Leite Pereira, who was responsible founding the operation, renaming the venerable industry Cer√¢mica Lima. His administration saw the expansion of the business, with 400 types of ceramics in various colours (in addition to the traditional white-and-blue), which they sold in their shops in Alminhas (Lagoa) and Rua dos Mercadores. Owing to illness, Bettencourt would sell his stake on 9 March 1973, on the eve of his death: he died on 12 March 1973.

As of 2016, Physix has yet to be released, though as of 2015, Wraith Games has announced that the game is still in active development, although with a shifted focus toward virtual reality. The company made its first full release, the Kongregate exclusive FlyGuy in December 2011. In April 2012, the company announced that FlyGuy would be released on iOS and Android OS although, as of 2016, this release has yet to surface. In 2015, their third game, Collapsus, was nominated for SlideDB (part of Indie DB)'s \\"App of the Year\\" awards making it into the Top 50. In 2016, Collapsus would go on to reach 4th place in the award's \\"Top Upcoming\\" category. It was first shown to the public when Wraith Games attended the Ohio Game Development Expo in 2015. When they returned in 2016, site CLE Tech named Collapsus as one of their \\"Top Picks\\" for the show. Collapsus was also showcased at Game Masters (exhibition) when it arrived at COSI Columbus in June 2016. Collapsus is notable for its unique resource management mechanic where \\"breaks\\" are lost by making clicks and regained by creating columns or rows of four or more same colored blocks; as well as for the player's ability to rotate the device, controlling the way the blocks on screen fall. According to The AbleGamers Foundation, Collapsus has \\"some of the fundamental building blocks of accessibility\\". The game is fully colorblind accessible, featuring different modes to cater to different types of colorblindness and can even be played in full black and white.

The Aln√∂ Complex is made up by a series of concentric dykes within a radius of 25 km of a main \\"central complex\\" of intrusions. In addition the Aln√∂ Complex proper is surrounded by a 500 to 600 m broad zone of metasomatic rock that was formed by metasomatic alteration of the existing Precambrian migmatite gneiss basement.

Life Marie Gabriel Joseph de Ramey was born in Paris. His father was Marie \\"Jacques\\" Henri de Ramey, the Viscount of Sugny (after the death of his elder brother, the Count of Sugny). Joseph's uncle was the politician Francisque-Joseph Ramey, the Count of Sugny (1825-1908). His mother, born Marie Louise \\"Isabelle\\" Le B√®gue, was the daughter of the banker-politician Charles Le B√®gue de Germiny (1799 - 1871). Both Joseph's own marriages would be to women from well placed families. He joined the navy at Toulon in 1873. He studied at the Prytan√©e National military academy and at the French Naval Academy. de Ramey was appointed a Midshipman Class 2 in August 1875 and embarked on his first posting, aboard the frigate \\"Renom√©e\\". Promoted to Midshipman Class 1 in 1876, he was assigned to the cruiser \\"Th√©mis\\", part of the South Atlantic naval division. In January 1879 he was promoted to ship's ensign. He was assigned a position as an instruction on the training frigate \\"R√©solue\\" and contributed to the production of a naval officer's manual (\\"Le Carnet de l'officier de marine\\"). He was sent to work with the naval maps and charts service (\\"D√©p√¥t des cartes et plans de la Marine\\"). He became a lieutenant in March 1884, serving on the cruiser \\"Infernet\\" in the South Atlantic naval division, and from January 1886 as adjutant to the divisional commander, . He took the opportunity to collect information on astronomy and hydrography. He served as officer of ship- handling (\\"de man≈ìuvre\\") and of look-out (\\"des montres\\") on the cruiser \\"Clorinde\\", part of the Newfoundland naval division before obtaining his own command in 1888 when he succeeded on the cruiser \\"La Clochetterie\\". In the meantime, he became a knight of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 19 December 1886. His hydrographical researches also led to his being attached to the Naval Hydrographic Service (\\"Service hydrographique et oc√©anographique de la Marine\\" / SHOM). In February 1889 de Ramey was seconded to the Navy Ministry. He represented the minister at the International Meteorological Congress held in Paris during the 1889 World Fair. In 1891 he was given command of the aviso \\"Actif\\" and then of the torpedo-aviso \\"Couleuvrine\\", stationed at Algiers for port and fisheries surveillance. He was then appointed aide de camp to on the cruiser \\"Na√Øade\\". He himself was promoted to the rank of frigate captain in 1896. He was appointed to the Gunnery School at the military port of Toulon where he was based for the next few years. In March 1900 he was given command of the armored cruiser \\"D'Estr√©es\\" with effect from January 1901. In November 1901 he was appointed to a land job as the French naval attach√© to Berlin where he maintained excellent relations with the German naval establishment and with the German emperor himself. De Ramey stayed in his Berlin posting till 1906. During this period, on 23 June 1903, he was promoted to the rank of vaisseau captain (\\"capitaine de vaisseau\\"). On returning from Berlin, de Ramey held a succession of commands, starting with the recently built armored cruiser L√©on Gambetta in April 1906.

Boudette (August 24, 1926 ‚Äì November 10, 2007) was an American geologist and professor who served as the State Geologist of New Hampshire between 1986 and 2000. Over the course of his life, Boudette also worked for the New England Division of the Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, NASA's Apollo Field Geology Investigation Team, and was a professor of geology at the University of New Hampshire. During his career, he authored or coauthored more than 80 geologic publications. Boudette Peaks in Antarctica were named after him by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for his mapping of the range while in the US Geological Survey. Early life Eugene Boudette was born in Claremont, New Hampshire, to William E. and Ida (Young) Boudette. He had five siblings, Norma, Thelma, Nathalie, William, and Earl, and they spent their childhood in Claremont and North Charlestown. Boudette graduated from Holden High School in Charlestown in 1944 and immediately entered the US Navy, serving until 1946. While in the Navy during World War II, Boudette trained and specialized in aircraft electronics at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida. He served in the Pacific theatre at Marpi Point Field on Saipan and spent some time at the Quonset Point Air National Guard Station in Rhode Island. He was awarded the World War II Pacific and American Theater service medals and the Victory Medal for his efforts. Following the war, Boudette used the G.I. Bill to attend the University of New Hampshire, and graduated with a B.S. in Geology in 1951. Career=Army Corps of Engineers Directly after graduating from UNH, Boudette joined with the New England Division of the US Army Corps of Engineers in a geological surveying role. His early work consisted of dam site evaluation for civilian needs, but he was quickly shifted into military projects, namely the construction of airfields and Army installations across New England. His geological work helped in the expedited construction of the Nike Missile Defense System of Boston and Limestone Air Force Base in northern Aroostook County, Maine. About a year into his stint with the Army Corps of Engineers, Boudette was sent to the northern Greenland icecap for experimental work using ice drills. The army was looking into ways to build installation foundations on the ice, and Boudette's background in rock drilling for dam installations made him an ideal candidate for test drilling in the icecap. Though they encountered a multitude of problems with the drills not withstanding the polar conditions, Boudette and his team successfully tested the drilling procedures for a base that would later become Camp Century. United States Geological Survey After his tour in Greenland, Boudette returned to the United States, where he interviewed for and was extended a role in the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1953. Between 1953 and 1956, Boudette worked with the Trace Element Program Cooperative (TEPCO) in Grand Junction, Colorado. Under TEPCO, Boudette assisted in locating and building the United States' reserves of weapons-grade uranium in the continental United States. Beginning in 1957, Boudette pursued his master's degree at Dartmouth College, where he wrote his master's thesis on the thermodynamics of plagioclase. After he completed his master's, the USGS assigned Boudette to the United States Antarctic Research Program. Boudette first traveled to Antarctica in 1959 to partake in the 1959-1960 Marie Byrd Land Traverse Party to study the geology and glaciology of the West Antarctic and to determine the feasibility of geological mapping of the area. The trip went from the Byrd Station to the Weddell Sea to the Clark Mountains and back to Byrd. One of Boudette's major goals during the traverse was to locate two peaks that were inaccurately mapped by air. Boudette discovered the true location of the twin peaks in the Executive Committee Range, and the mountain was named Boudette Peaks in his honor by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names. The success of the 1959‚Äì1960 Marie Byrd Land Traverse Party prompted the USGS to plan another traverse for the summer of 1960‚Äì1961 called the Victoria Land Traverse under Boudette's leadership. Unfortunately, the Antarctic summer of 1960‚Äì1961 was plagued by logistical problems, sunspots interrupting communications, and inclement weather, causing the Victoria Land Traverse to delay and ultimately miss its objectives. To further complicate matters, Boudette, while in New Zealand awaiting a flight down to Antarctica, was subjected to a Navy medical review that found he had diabetes. The disease disqualified him from all future field research projects in Antarctica, and he relinquished his duties to Art Ford, another USGS geologist. Boudette was awarded the Antarctica Service Medal by the Department of Defense for his contributions to the geological mapping of Antarctica. Apollo Field Geology Investigation Team Between 1961 and 1971, Eugene Boudette was mainly based out of Washington, D.C., from where he did field work in Maine as well as worked as a USGS geologic map editor. In January 1971, Boudette was sent to the USGS office in Flagstaff, Arizona, to participate in the Apollo Field Geology Investigation Team (AFGIT). In this role, he assisted in the mapping of potential landing sites for the Apollo Missions 15, 16, and 17 through the study of photogeologic mapping from previous missions. He also participated in field training missions with astronauts to simulate the lunar landing sites. Boudette travelled to impact craters on the Canadian Shield and volcanic centers in Hawaii, teaching astronauts about the geological similarities between the Earth and Moon and how to perform geologic sampling in a lunar environment. Boudette is cited as one of the major contributors to the geological mapping for the landing sites of the final three Apollo missions. Retirement and later life Dr. Eugene Boudette in his office as the New Hampshire State Geologist Eugene Boudette earned his Ph.D. in geology at Dartmouth in 1978. He continued working with the US Geological Survey until his retirement in 1986. After his retirement from government service, Boudette was appointed New Hampshire State Geologist and served until 2000. In his retirement years, he also took a position as a professor of geology at the University of New Hampshire. Boudette continued to research and write about various geological topics in New Hampshire late into his life. Eugene Boudette died at the age of 81 on November 10, 2007, at Concord Hospital in New Hampshire.

Language Lardil, now moribund, belongs to the Tangkic language family. The feature of kinship- sensitive pronominal prefixes had been ignored until they were discovered by Kenneth L. Hale in a study of Lardil. A special second language, Damin thought of as a tongue created by the Yellow Trevally fish ancestor Kaltharr, and devised in part to mimic 'fish talk' was taught during the second degree of initiation (warama). This initiation register of specialized Lardil has fascinated linguists: it contained in its phonemic repertoire two types of airstream initiation, a pulmonic ingressive (l*) and a labiovelar lingual egressive (p'), unique among the world's languages. The secret language reinscribed in what looks like an indigenous form of semantic analysis the entire Lardil vocabulary into 200 words and has been described by Hale as a 'monument to the human intellect'. Since Damin was a language involving rituals disapproved of by the missionaries, it disappeared with the outlawing and suppression of the Lardil ritual cycles. Ecology and lifestyle Rockwall fish traps (derndernim) were constructed off the coast to catch varieties of fish as the tides receded. The Lardil had a meticulous ethnobotanical knowledge and David McKnight has argued that \\"their botanical taxonomy is of the same intellectual order as our botanical scientific taxonomy\\". People raised within the mission, once detached from the hunter and gatherer lifestyle of the traditional community, were considered good workers to recruit for the pastoral stations, where they were employed as drovers and ringers. Once the mission was closed, the elderly once more regained some control. However the Landil people who had spent their mature years on the mainland as farm workers had no traditional background for raising children to draw on. The result was that the generation of children raised from the 1960s onwards had no grasp of either the old or new work technologies and ethics. Christian mission With the exception of Sweers Island, all the Wellesley Islands were set aside as an Aboriginal reserve. Generally, once Aboriginal resistance to the take-over of their lands was broken, they were concentrated in reserves and missions. Presbyterian missionaries were granted permission to establish a mission on Mornington Island, and one was duly built in 1914. A mission was established on Mornington Island by the Rev. Robert Hall, his wife and two assistants, Mr and Mrs Owen, and Hall strove to institute economic self-sufficiency for the islanders' economy, having an all native crew manning the ketch, while organising the harvesting and curing of trepang. Their initial presence, according to one account, was received positively by the Landil people. Hall was speared and killed in 1917 by a Landil man, \\"Burketown Peter/Bad Peter\\" a respected drover based in Burketown, who ran into trouble, often standing up for his rights, and wanted to kill a cattle station owner with whom he fell out, but was dissuaded from doing so and told by Ganggalida people to return to his home country after refusing to obey local demands that he move back to the mainland. Dormitory system Hall was succeeded by the Rev. Wilson, who imposed a dormitory system, segregating children from their elders and thus breaking the chain of tradition through which tribal lore and law was transmitted. The older generations were normally left to their own devices as missionaries concentrated on separating them from their children, and concentrating their efforts on the youngest: aside from religious indoctrination, sexual and marriage customs were challenged, and subject to control. Few dormitory Landil girls married according to the traditional kin ship rules, given that the mission head played an influential role as intermediary. The dormitory system was discontinued in 1954. Self- government The population of the island is no longer exclusively Landil, after several tribal groups, among them the Kaiadilt, were displaced and concentrated on Bentinck island. The Mornington Island Mission was substituted by a community administration in 1978. The Shire council in the 1970s introduced a beer canteen, government developmental funds were seen as allowing one to dispense with the necessity to work, and, as alcoholism spread, the Mornington Island peoples began to rank as one of the communities with the highest suicide incidence in Australia. Mornington Island, with its schools, churches, libraries and hospitals is often presented as a model community to outsiders. Its society however has been devastated by alcohol.

Unlike many other northern Aboriginal groups, particularly those of Arnhem Land, they appear to have had little contact with Southern Asian island traders such as the Makassans, something attested by the lack of loanwords from the Malay, Buginese and Makassarese languages, though some early records indicate tamarind and teak had been harvested by visitors who had axes, and earthenware pots have been uncovered. They were generally diffident with strangers. The first white man to have set foot on the island was Matthew Flinders, captain of HMS Investigator in 1802. Sometime around 1916, a man remembered only as McKenzie came to Bentinck Island and set up a sheep run, basing himself on a site at the mouth of the Kurumnbali estuary. He would ride over the island, accompanied by a pack of dogs, and shoot any Kaiadilt man who came within sight; in local memory, he murdered at least 11 people. He also kidnapped and raped native girls. He then moved to Sweers Island, and set up a lime kiln there. The Kaiadilt managed to return to Sweers only on McKenzie's departure. The massacre was only recorded by researchers in the 1980s. Sweers Island was declared an Aboriginal reserve in 1934. After a cyclonic tidal surge swept the area in 1948, which followed fast on the severe drought that struck in 1946, the Kaiadilt were transferred by missionaries and the Queensland Government to Mornington Island. The uprooting effectively set in place the process of the destruction of both Kaiadilt culture and language since all children were restricted to dormitories, away from their parents and kin, and the transmission of the language and lore was lost. On Mornington Island they lived in a separate zone, in beach humpies facing Bentinck Island. They were looked down on by the Indigenous Lardil people, who denied them access to the fishing grounds. Conditions were so severe that for several years all children were stillborn, creating a gap in the generations. From the late 1960s onwards, the Kaiadilt began to return to their own islands. Country The territory of Bentinck Island and its contiguous reefs amount to roughly ; the nation's western border lay at Allen Island. Native title In 1994, a Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT) was given to the original inhabitants, represented by the Kaiadilt Aboriginal Land Trust, which made a native title claim in 1996. The application concerned all the area covered from Bentinck and Sweer Islands' high water line for \\"as far as the eye could see\\". In The Lardil Peoples v State of Queensland [2004] FCA 298, the Federal Court accorded the owners rights to five nautical miles seaward. People and society The Kaiadilt had the highest population density of all known Aboriginal Australian peoples, at 1.7 persons per square mile. They are characterised by having a high percentage, 43%, of B-group blood carriers, which is very rare within the continental Australian Aboriginal population. A high incidence of blond hair occurs among their children. Another feature that marks them off is that the Kaiadilt allow women to join in the circumcision rites. Their society, according to Norman Tindale, lacked the classificatory system characteristic of most Aboriginal Australian societies, though they were divided into eight kin groups (dolnoro). Language The Kayardild language is an agglutinating, completely suffixing member of the Tangkic languages, but unlike most Australian languages, including others classified under Tangkic including Yukulta, Kayardild exhibits a case morphology that is accusative, rather than ergative. Etymologically Kayardild is a compound formed from ka (ng) 'language' and yardild (a) 'strong', thus meaning 'strong language'. Analysis of the grammar of Kayardild revealed that it provided an empirical challenge to a theorem regarding putative linguistic universals in natural languages. Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom asserted that \\"no language uses noun affixes to express tense\\", a claim that reflected a tradition in Western thought going back to Aristotle. Nicholas Evans discovered a breach in the theory, for Kayardild happens to inflect not only verbs, but also nouns, for tense. Kayardild was spoken by no more than perhaps 150 people, and by 1982, when Nicholas Evans began to record it, the numbers had declined to approximately 40. By 2005, only seven fluent speakers remained, and the last speaker of classical Kayardild died in 2015, though it is also reported that there was still one fluent female speaker as late as February 2017. Some words * duljawinda ('car') literally 'ground-runner' * wadubayiinda ('tobacco') form by combining wadu (smoke) with the root bayii- (be bitten). The literal meaning is: 'that by means of which the smoke is bitten' Source: Ecology and lifestyle The Kaiadilt once thrived on what has been called a \\"sterile shelf of laterite covered flatland\\". The general area is characterised by reef- building corals, predominantly Acropora hyacinthus and the associated molluscs, some 400 varieties of which had been discovered by the early 1900s. For the Kaiadilt, Bentinck island was Dulkawalnged (the land of all) while the outlying Sweers and Allen islands were Dangkawaridulk (lands void of men). Despite the poor soil, a wide variety of vegetables were noted by early travellers. The basic arborial cover consisted of small varieties of eucalyptus, casuarina and pandanus. The Kaiadilt lived on a maritime seafood economy, with nomadic movements determined by weather and seasons. The division of labour meant women gathered on the littoral such foods as small rock oysters (tjilangind), mud cockles (kulpanda) and crabs, while the men, when not harvesting the catch from rock fish traps (ngurruwarra), which are found one every .9 kilometres around Bentinck's coastline, but also along the shores of Sweers islands's calcareous peneplain, foraged more broadly for sharks, turtle and dugong. After the monsoonal rains, the rich silt flow from Queensland rivers into the Gulf lowered salinity allowing marine grasses on which the latter browsed to thrive. Mythology Kaiadilt mythology was first collected by the anthropologist Norman Tindale, who began field work on the island in 1942. Their mythology evokes a mysterious being whose name means \\"he who walks behind\\" led the Kaiadilt to discover water, at Berumoi, by the northerly tip of Bentinck island. The construction of the rock traps for fishing is attributed to the mythical creatures Bujuku (black crane) and Kaarrku (seagull).

The duo began their career as remixers in the city of New York, United States, eventually signing to their first ever major record label. Their 2010 single \\"Dancing With The DJ\\" was their first instant online success. Philadelphia hiphop band Chiddy Bang sampled The Knocks' \\"Blackout\\" for their single \\"Here We Go\\" (featuring Q-Tip) from their EP The Preview. Chiddy Bang subsequently sampled The Knocks' \\"When You've Got Music\\" and \\"Dancing with the DJ\\" for their mixtape Peanut Butter and Swelly. After the success of \\"Dancing With The DJ\\", their debut extended play, entitled Magic was released in 2011. In 2012, their cover of \\"Midnight City\\" by M83 featuring vocals by Mandy Lee, had 10,000 downloads in its first week on the website SoundCloud. In June, the duo took the number one spot on the website HypeMachine with the track \\"Learn to Fly\\", which reached 100,000 plays on SoundCloud within a week of its release. \\"Geronimo\\", a collaboration with French producer Fred Falke, was released on Kitsun√© Records in July 2012. Later on in November 2012, the duo were featured alongside pop sensation St Lucia in Icona Pop's song \\"Sun Goes Down\\", which was released on their debut album Icona Pop. It was later revealed that the song was the duo's very first feature and co-produced track. Afterwards, the duo released another successful single, featuring St. Lucia, entitled \\"Modern Hearts\\", in the beginning of 2013 and earned the group another number-one placing on HypeMachine and reached the 100,000 plays mark on SoundCloud in four days. Within the same year, another single, entitled \\"Comfortable\\", which featured vocals from X Ambassadors, was released, which was the made the lead single of their second extended play, also entitled \\"Comfortable\\". In 2014, The Knocks released a single on Neon Gold Records/Big Beat Records, \\"Classic\\", featuring alt-pop duo POWERS. An official video was released that paid homage to video game The Sims. After it was released, they released a \\"Powers Sunset Version\\" which followed on shortly afterwards. This followed the songs \\"Dancing with Myself\\", \\"Collect My Love\\", featuring Alex Newell, and \\"Time\\" being released in early 2015. These tracks made up their third EP, entitled So Classic, which was released in April 2015. Throughout the rest of the year, the duo began working on their debut album, entitled 55, which featured collaborations from the likes of Fetty Wap, Cam'ron, Wyclef Jean, Carly Rae Jepsen, Matthew Koma, Magic Man, Alex Newell, POWERS, Phoebe Ryan, Justin Tranter, Walk the Moon, and X Ambassadors. Once released, there was an explosive post-success for the duo, as songs from the album were promoted on advertisements and shows across the US, as well as producing musical material for other artists for the first time, including Carly Rae Jepsen and Wyclef Jean.

It landed on D-Day and saw action throughout the campaign in North West Europe, providing early warning of attacks by V-1 flying bombs against Antwerp during the winter of 1944‚Äì45. Origin 80th AA Brigade was formed on 10 April 1943 at Blandford Camp under the command of Brigadier H.W. Deacon. Within a month the Headquarters (HQ) and mobile AA Operations Room (AAOR) personnel and the Brigade Signal Section had joined, and the brigade had taken command of its first units: 86th (Honourable Artillery Company) and 103rd Heavy AA Regiments, 73rd and 114th Light AA Regiments.Frederick, p. 1052.80 AA Bde War Diary 1943, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/11248. Brigadier Henry Wynn Deacon (1893‚Äì1977) was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1913 and had served during World War I. Seconded to the Royal Air Force as an observer (1918‚Äì20), he had been awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for making reconnaissance flights under fire during the closing weeks of the Mesopotamian campaign.Routledge, p. 308.Half-Yearly Army Lists 1919‚Äì39.Deacon's RAF service record, TNA file AIR 76/129/88.London Gazette 5 April 1919.Deacon at Generals of WWII. Since the outbreak of World War II he had commanded 13th Anti-Tank Regiment in the Battle of France and then served in the West African defences. Latterly he had commanded the Fixed Defences in Home Forces.Farndale, p. 16 and Annex J. Training 80th AA Brigade did not form part of Anti-Aircraft Command but came under the Hampshire and Dorset District of Home Forces, and was later assigned to Second Army forming for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). Immediately upon formation, the brigade began training with Nos 5 and 6 Beach Parties, which would control the support services during the assault landings on Sword Beach. Demonstrations of opposed beach landing by AA guns were carried out in May 1943, and the regiments attended practice camps in various part of the UK. On completion of training and field exercises, the regiments were sometimes deployed under AA Command formations to assist Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB). In Second Army's plan for Overlord, I Corps, supported by 80th AA Bde, was to land on two beaches, Sword and Juno, while XXX Corps, supported by 76th AA Bde, was to land on the other beach (Gold). In January 1944, 76th AA Bde was placed under the command of 80th AA Bde for operations and training, an arrangement that remained in place until after D-Day.80 AA Bde War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. Light AA (LAA) defence was to be emphasised at the start of the operation, since low- level attack by Luftwaffe aircraft was considered the most likely threat. In December 1943‚ÄìJanuary 1944, 114th LAA Rgt carried out user trials at No 16 AA Practice Camp at Clacton-on-Sea on self-propelled (SP) 40 mm Bofors guns mounted on Crusader tank chassis, a proportion of which later equipped that regiment and 73rd LAA Rgt. On 1 January, 93rd LAA Regiment joined from ADGB. This regiment was given a special assault role in the Overlord plan, for which it was equipped with the new 20 mm Polsten gun in triple mountings, half of them mounted on Crusader chassis.Joslen, p. 583.80 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 20 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1124.Routledge, pp. 305‚Äì7.

Tactical HQ sailed on 5 June and was due to land at 11.00 on 6 June (D-Day) but was delayed because of congestion on the beaches. Eventually it landed at 15.30 near Courseulles-sur- Mer, by which time the AA Report Centre on the beach was functioning satisfactorily. Tactical HQ was established at Beny-sur-Mer. The brigade's units experienced considerable problems during the landings, with losses of landing craft and hard fire-fights still going on to establish a firm hold, especially at Juno. 73rd LAA Rgt managed to land some of its 40 mm Bofors guns on the first tide, but heavy fire prevented 218th Bty from reaching its positions until five hours later, while 220th Bty found its intended positions to be still in enemy hands. 80th AA Bde's communication difficulties meant that 73rd LAA Rgt remained out of contact until the following day (D+1). None of the HAA guns were successfully landed until the following afternoon, and these were damaged in landing. Luckily, Luftwaffe air attacks on D-Day were few and sporadic. Additional Troops of 73rd and 114th LAA Rgts landed on D+1 as air attacks began to increase, peaking on D+3.Routledge, pp. 308‚Äì10. B Troop of 322/103 HAA Bty had a secondary coastal artillery role to protect shipping off Queen sector from attack by German E-boats, particularly at night. For this purpose 16 Fire Control Post and 76 and 103 Coast Observer detachments were landed with it, under command of 103rd HAA Rgt. The guns would fire blind, controlled by radar, or with the assistance of searchlights. Once the initial landings had been achieved, the AA Assault Groups were broken up and reorganised by regimental groups, the regimental commander being AA Defence Commander for the local area. The troop of 92nd LAA set off to join the glider troops at B√©nouville (Pegasus Bridge) and the brigade settled down to its initial task of defending the unloading shipping and landing craft, and the beach exits. Normandy Crusader AA tank mounting a triple 20mm gun in a hull-down position, 19 July 1944 As the build-up in the Normandy beachhead grew during June and July 1944, 80 AA Bde was tasked with protecting Juno and Sword beaches, the small port of Ouistreham, and the Orne and Caen Canal bridges at B√©nouville, the whole being designated an Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ) at night.Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319. For June, 80th AA Bde reported ratios of one aircraft shot down for every 253 HAA or 1097 LAA rounds fired.Routledge, pp. 312‚Äì5. Although Luftwaffe air attacks over the beachhead were generally sporadic, they concentrated on the bridges, while Sword Beach and the whole Eastern Sector remained under mortar and artillery fire. At the end of July, 114th LAA Rgt reported that it was being attacked by a 'secret weapon'. Upon investigation it appeared that it was being shelled by a large calibre gun from long range. When the first elements of 100th AA Bde arrived (starting with 113th (Durham Light Infantry) LAA Rgt and 60th (City of London) HAA Rgt), they were temporarily placed under the orders of 80th AA Bde. Some of 63/20th LAA Bty's crews were washed off their Gooseberries during the storm of 19/20 June, and they were sent to reinforce 73rd and 114th LAA Rgts. Given the low intensity of Luftwaffe air attacks, HAA guns in the bridgehead were sometimes made available to fire on ground targets for bombardment, counter- battery and anti-tank shoots. For example, 80th AA Bde's 3.7-inch guns fired in support of I Corps during Operation Charnwood on 8 July. The brigade's HAA guns stationed at the mouth of the Orne were also tasked with a role in coast defence, to fire an airburst high explosive barrage against enemy craft if requested by the Royal Navy. Some searchlights from 474th S/L Battery were also given a subsidiary coast defence role, while radar sets were used to plot Parachute mines being dropped by German aircraft in the anchorage (though the AA guns were forbidden to engage them for fear of causing casualties among the shipping). A roving Troop of 114th LAA Rgt was sent to protect an important ammunition ship unloading at Ouistreham.101 Sub-Area Notes, 18 March 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085. Brigadier Deacon was awarded a CBE for his work in planning and commanding the AA defences for D-Day and the subsequent Normandy campaign,80 AA Bde War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4893.Deacon's citation at TNA file WO 373/83/48. and later received a US Bronze Star for his war services.London Gazette 19 November 1948. Breakout A Matador tractor tows a 3.7-inch AA gun through the ruins of Caen, August 1944. At the end of August, 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead and began to pursue the defeated German troops across Northern France. AA defence of the beachhead became less important and 80th AA Bde could be released from its commitments there in order to follow the advance. First, 114th LAA Rgt was sent to guard the crossings of the River Seine under the command of the newly arrived 74th AA Bde. Then 80th AA Bde was relieved on 3 September and took over responsibility for the Seine crossings the following day, with 274/86th HAA Bty, 73rd and 125th (Cameronians) LAA Rgts (the latter from 76th AA Bde), and a troop of 474th S/L Bty under command.Routledge, p. 317‚Äì20; Table L, p. 327.Table LI, pp. 328‚Äì9. On 12 September, 80th AA Bde relieved 76th AA Bde at Dieppe with 86th and 103rd HAA Rgts, retaining 146th HAA Rgt from 76th and being rejoined by 114th LAA Rgt. It also rook over responsibility for Rouen, Abbeville and the bridges over the River Somme from 107th AA Brigade, sending 146th HAA there, taking over 120th LAA Rgt and 177/139th LAA Bty. On 19 September, 1, 3 and 4 LAA/SL Btys arrived at the Seine crossings, relieving 73rd LAA Rgt, which moved to Le Havre, while 120th and 125th LAA Rgts went to Boulogne, which was still being besieged. Newly arrived batteries of 41st and 42nd S/L Rgts joined the brigade at Dieppe: one of the roles for the searchlights was to illuminate Prisoner of War (PoW) camps. Later, 146th HAA Rgt and 6/20th LAA Bty left to join 75th AA Bde further up the coast at Ostend, and 73rd LAA Rgt joined 103rd AA Bde. Antwerp V-1 in flight over Antwerp The headlong advance ended with the failure of Operation Market Garden at Arnhem, and emphasis shifted to bringing the port of Antwerp into use as a supply base. The planners envisaged a large Gun Defence Area (GDA) to deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers').Routledge, pp. 322, 333. At the beginning of October, 80th AA Bde began to equip its HAA units with Radar No 3 Mark V (the SCR-584 radar set) and No 10 Predictors (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer), and began training operators on them in preparation for tracking these small fast- moving targets. Meanwhile, 114th LAA Rgt was re-equipped with the HAA's Vickers No 1 Predictor.Routledge, p. 334. 80th AA Bde handed over its responsibilities at Dieppe and arrived to reinforce the Antwerp defences with 73rd LAA, 86th HAA and 155th AAOR on 17 October. It was ready for action the following day, while 114th LAA reinforced 5th Royal Marine AA Bde in the city. The first 'Diver' arrived in the Antwerp area on 23 October.Routledge, Table LII, p. 331; pp. 334‚Äì5. At the beginning of November, 80th AA Bde was given responsibility for all early warning and tracking for Antwerp and Brussels. While Bde HQ concentrated in this task, all its units were distributed under the operational command of other British and US AA brigades, apart from those training on the new radar and predictors.Routledge, Table LIII, p. 342. Captured V-1 displayed at Antwerp at the end of World War II. To defend against V-1s falling in the city and dock area, the British and US guns had to be positioned at least 10 miles outside the city (codenamed the Nylen Belt), integrated into a system of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. No 1 Identification Troop and No 2 Local Warning (Radar) Troop were formed by 80 AA Bde for this purpose, manned by the Royal Signals and 114th LAA Rgt respectively. This 'Antwerp X' defence deployment took its full form in December 1944, in time for the peak in V-1 attacks that lasted into February 1945.Routledge, pp. 336‚Äì9. The responsibility for siting the six early warning stations and 30 gun position radar sets over a wide area fell to 80th AA Bde's Instructor Fire Control (Radar), Captain William Adams, and his assistant, Staff Sergeant B.T. Bayne. They travelled extensively, training the operators and troubleshooting problems on the new radar. The effectiveness of the early warning system steadily improved, so that by the end of the campaign it was operating at almost 100 per cent efficiency. Captain Adams was awarded the US Bronze Star and S/Sgt Bayne the Belgian Croix de Guerre for their work.Adams' s citation, TNA file WO 373/147/381.Bayne's citation, TNA file WO 373/111/1044. When the Germans began their offensive in the Ardennes in December 1944 (the Battle of the Bulge) and briefly threatened to break through to Antwerp, 80 AA Bde was warned on 20 December to prepare to convert into an Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) at short notice. AGRAs were groups of (usually) medium and heavy artillery held at Corps level. If necessary, the brigade would control 98th and 99th (London Welsh) HAA Rgts to operate in the medium role supporting 11th Armoured Division and 3rd AGRA. The brigade would also be responsible for the ground defence of the approaches to Tirlemont, taking anti-paratroop measures. 86th (HAC) HAA regiment, which was relieving 98th HAA Rgt in the Antwerp X defences, was to lend its transport (1584 Platoon, RASC) to make the latter regiment fully mobile. Despite concerted attacks on nearby airfields by Luftwaffe fighters on 1 January (Operation Bodenplatte), the ground situation was well under control and the AGRA and local defence plans were cancelled on that day. Germany V-1 attacks on Antwerp continued during the winter of 1944‚Äì45. On 2 March 1945, one of the radar stations was hit by a flying bomb, with casualties and considerable damage to equipment. However, as the Allied forces advanced into Germany the air threat dwindled. The last V-1 landed at Antwerp on 29 March. By late April 1945, a number of AA units had been declared surplus to requirements and were awaiting disbandment. 80th AA Bde was ordered to hand over all its units to other HQs and prepare for garrison duties. By VE Day, Brigade HQ was carrying out occupation duties at L√ºbeck in Germany, with 28th Battalion Royal Marines and a Special Air Service squadron under command.Farndale, Annex M.Routledge, p 363; Table LVII, p. 366. After the end of the war in Europe, 80th AA Bde HQ continued to command occupation forces, engaged in guarding and repatriating PoWs and displaced persons (Operation Clobber), and in internal security exercised through the Wehrmacht Control Police. By the beginning of 1946 it was based at Eutin in Schleswig-Holstein, with the Royal Dragoons, 98th (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry) Field Rgt and 93rd LAA Rgt under command, though 93rd LAA was disbanded during January. Brigade HQ itself was disbanded on 25 February 1946.80 AA Bde War Diary 1946, TNA file WO 171/8880. Postwar In 1947, a new 80 AA Brigade was formed in the Territorial Army (TA). However, this was unconnected with the wartime formation of the same number; instead it was formed by reconstituting the TA's former 54 AA Bde at Sutton Coldfield. It was disbanded after less than two years.Routledge, p. 441.AA Bdes 67‚Äì106 at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947. Litchfield, Appendix 5.

Graham and Brothers and originally known as H. B. Graham, was a privately owned American printer, manufacturer, and distributor of paper products. It is the oldest paper company in the United States west of the Mississippi River. By the 1960s, Graham Paper was the largest wholesaler of paper in the United States. At its height, the company had 27 distribution centers throughout the country, including in every major city. The company sold stationery, paperboard, newsprint sheets, spools of twine, machine-finished coated papers, wood-free uncoated papers, coated fine papers, and special fine papers. Major clients included national and regional newspaper companies, book publishers, boards of education, and state governments. History Graham Paper was founded in 1855 by Henry Brown Graham. A Cincinnati native, Graham moved to St. Louis where he became a pioneering industrialist in printing and paper manufacturing. He is credited with constructing the first paper mills west of the Mississippi River. The company was founded during the beginning stages of the Second Industrial Revolution. In the 1840s, Charles Fenerty in Nova Scotia and Friedrich Gottlob Keller in Saxony, both invented a successful machine which extracted the fibres from wood, as well as rags, in order to generate paper. This revolution in technology introduced a new era for paper making and was a core element of the Second Industrial Revolution, in general. It was within this historical context, of the fast-growing demand and technological change in paper making, that led Henry Graham to found his company in St. Louis, as a means of entering this new market. In 1855, St. Louis was the most populated city west of the Mississippi River and the second largest port city, by aggregate tonnage, in the United States. With its strategic location along the major steamboat transportation routes, as well as its central proximity to the city's waterfront lumberyards, St. Louis was geographically and economically primed to become a major paper producing center during the Second Industrial Revolution. Indeed, these conditions proved to be conducive to Graham Paper's financial success, as the company grew rapidly following the Civil War era. Among the first buildings Henry Graham had built included a rag warehouse, for the storage of raw materials in the production of cotton paper. The company located its facilities in the waterfront district of St. Louis for easy access to river shipping. There were also a number of lumberyards located in the waterfront district during this era. Graham Paper was incorporated in August 1880. In 1897, the company experienced a major financial setback with the loss of large stock inventory, due to a fire that destroyed half of the Security warehouse in St. Paul, Minnesota. In the late 1890s, the company decided to relocate from the waterfront district to the Cupples block, a state-of-the-art industrial development project being constructed in the Mill Creek Valley area of St. Louis. According to geographer Virginia Henry, many business elite considered the move ill-advised, as it was commonly believed that Graham Paper was moving too far from its business contacts in the downtown area. She notes, however, that \\"the move proved to be a wise one for not long afterward many of the printers in the old town began moving out and locating further west.\\" Additionally, she notes: In 1901, Graham Paper bought out one of its most successful rivals, the Brown & Clark Company, based in St. Louis. The company had been previously founded by former Graham Paper employees. Successors In 1970, Graham Paper was bought out by the Kansas City Star Company. As part of the agreement, Graham Paper was merged with Flambeau Paper, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kansas City Star. The merger was completed on July 12, 1971, at which time the new parent company became known as Star Industries, Incorporated. In 1977, Graham Paper was sold to Jim Walter Paper, Inc., a subsidiary of Jim Walter Corporation of Jacksonville, Florida. At this time, the Graham Paper name ceased to exist, although Harry W. Henry II and other senior management of the company continued unchanged after the acquisition. Henry continued on until 1978, becoming the last president of Graham Paper Company. In 1989, Jim Walter Paper was sold to Butler Paper Company, a subsidiary of Alco Standard. In 1996, Alco split into two companies based on Alco's two major divisions: Ikon and Unisource. Ikon Office Solutions became an office copier, whereas Unisource Worldwide became a paper sales and distribution company. The latter company is the most recent successor to Graham Paper and is likewise headquartered in St. Louis. Facilities In 1900, under the management of Benjamin Graham, the Graham Paper Company built a new headquarters in downtown St. Louis at the corner of 11th and Spruce Streets. The seven-story brick building was one of twenty built between 1897 and 1917 that became known as the Cupples Station Historic District. In 1988, the National Park Service approved the addition of the Cupples Station Warehouse District to the National Register of Historic Places. At the time, only 8 of the original 20 structures remained. In 2013, the former headquarters of the Graham Paper Company was unregistered from the National Register of Historic Places and subsequently destroyed by a demolition crew. The destruction of the Graham Paper building, also known as Cupples 7, generated controversy in St. Louis. As a result of the loss of the historic building, a group of city leaders held a series of meetings in 2013 to discuss reforms to historic building preservation in St. Louis, in the hope that another \\"Graham Paper Company\\" would not occur in a similar loss to the city's historic architecture. In 1957, under the management of Harry W. Henry, the company finished construction of a 40,000 square foot manufacturing facility in St. Louis. The single floor concrete, brick, and steel plant was constructed to manufacture paper for the national chain of 25 paper distributors. The facility was necessary in order to deal with the expansion of market share and was thus built with approximately 30,000 square feet of storage space and three separate rail lines. The historic Spruce Street headquarters continued on as the central office for the company. Presidents * Henry Graham (1855‚Äì1885) * Benjamin B. Graham (1885‚Äì1904) * H. M.

Robert Henry Peters (August 2, 1946 ‚Äì June 26, 1996) was a Canadian ecologist and limnologist that championed a predictive approach to science in order to make quantitative models relevant to public needs. He proposed that predictive limnology could be an effective tool for producing empirical models about relevant processes and organisms in lakes. He was a Professor in the Biology Department of McGill University, Montreal, Canada from 1974 to his death in 1996. Early life and education Robert H Peters was born on August 2, 1946 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he grew up. He spent summers at a cottage in the Kawartha lakes region, where he developed his keen interest in natural history. He obtained his BSc and PhD (1972) from the University of Toronto. His thesis on nutrient regeneration by zooplankton was supervised by Frank Rigler, a mentor and friend who profoundly influenced his vision of science. Peters‚Äô postdoctoral studies were held in Pallanza (Italy), Vienna (Austria), and Munich (Germany). In particular, the Istituto Italiano di Idrobiologia in Pallanza (now the Institute of Ecosystem Study) remained for him a special and unique place where he returned for three sabbatical leaves to profit from the stimulating presence of many colleagues, as well as access to the Istituto‚Äôs vast library. It was in Pallanza that he met his wife Antonella Cattaneo with whom he had two children, Julian and Elisa. Through his Italian family, he acquired a lasting love for Italian culture. Scientific career Peters joined the Department of Biology of McGill University as Assistant Professor in 1974, becoming Associate Professor in 1979, then Full Professor in 1986. During his career, he published over 130 scientific papers, comments and book chapters and wrote four influential books. Throughout his career, Peters strived to make ecology more quantitative and more directly relevant to addressing real-world environmental problems. His first major contribution was the book Ecological Implications of Body Size.,Peters RH. 1983. The ecological implications of body size. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK a compilation of relationships between the body size of an organism and various physiological and community processes. This book is still highly cited (more than 5000 citations up to October 2016) and was influential in laying much of the groundwork for new fields of ecological research, most notably work on the metabolic theory.Brown JH, Gillooly JF, Allen AP, Savage VM, West GB. 2004. Toward a metabolic theory of ecology. Ecology 85: 1771‚Äì1789 Accomplishments and new hypotheses generated by Peters‚Äô book were recently discussed in a symposium titled ‚ÄúSize-based approaches to aquatic ecosystems and fisheries science: a symposium in honour of Rob Peters‚Äù (American Fisheries Society Meeting, Quebec City, August 2015) and published in an issue of the Canadian Journal of Fisheries Aquatic Sciences Canadian Journal of Fisheries Aquatic Sciences 2016 (4): 471-726 Peters presented his ideas on the shortcomings of ecology in several papers,Peters RH. 1976. Tautology in evolution and ecology. American Naturalist 110: 1-122Peters RH. 1986. The role of prediction in limnology. Limnology and Oceanography 31: 1143-1159Peters RH. 1988. Some general problems for ecology illustrated by food web theory. Ecology 69: 1673-1676 which were extended and summarized in his book A Critique for Ecology.Peters RH. 1991. A critique for ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK In this book, Peters contends that, since science is a tool for obtaining information about nature through predictions, a substantial part of ecology cannot be considered to be science because it provides no concrete predictive models. Peters argues specifically that a return to observing patterns and asking simple solvable questions of general relevance to science and society could make ecology a useful, practical, and informative science, which is desperately needed to meet the problems of our age. This book was very controversial, and received both sharp criticism and high praise and still generates lively debates on the effectiveness of current approaches to ecology. A day-long session (Predictive limnology revisited: Rob Peters‚Äô legacy after 20 years) was dedicated to this discussion at the XXXIII International Society of Limnology Congress held in Torino, Italy from July 31 to August 5, 2016. Peters published reflections on how limnologists/ecologists conduct research and teach science in his last book Science and Limnology Rigler FH and Peters RH 1995. Science and Limnology. Ecology Institute, Oldendorf-Luhe, Germany co-authored by his mentor, the late Frank Rigler.

SPB Academic Publishing, The Hagues, the Netherlands a compilation of empirical models developed for inland waters. Awards In 1991 Robert Peters was awarded the International Ecology Institute prize in Limnetic Ecology, in recognition of his scientific contributions to aquatic ecology. He also received the Frank Rigler Award from the Society of Canadian Limnologists in 1992. The Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) posthumously granted him the ASLO Citation for Scientific Excellence in 1997. In 2006 the Society of Canadian Limnologists instituted the Rob Peters Award, presented annually to recognize the best aquatic sciences paper published the preceding year by a Canadian student.

In its first season of football, the team compiled a 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and outscored all opponents, 24 to 16. The team was organized in January 1899 by Professor R. H. Forbes, but no games were played until the fall when a student committee raised $70 from merchants in the Old Pueblo to purchase uniforms. Stuart Forbes was the team's coach, George M. Parker was the manager and team captain. The team's colors during the 1899 season were sage green and silver. ScheduleGame summaries On November 20, 1899, the University of Arizona football team played its first official football game, after an earlier practice game against a Tucson, Arizona, town team. The November 20 game, also played against a Tucson town team, ended in a scoreless tie. On November 30, 1899, the team played its first intercollegiate football game against the Normal School of Arizona (later renamed Arizona State University). The inaugural meeting in the Arizona‚ÄìArizona State football rivalry ended in an 11‚Äì2 score in favor of the Tempe team. The game was played in front of an estimated 300 spectators at the Carillo Gardens amusement center near the Santa Cruz River in Tucson. The team's third game was played on January 13, 1900, against the football team from the Tucson Indian School. The University team won that game by a 22 to 0 score. Players The team's roster included the following players: Willard Morse Brown, Duncan Hugh Campbell, Rudolph Castaneda, Courtland F. Day, Frank Wakefield Fish, John Garnett Holmes, Thomas K.

The presence of sea ice requires a ship to exercise caution, for example by avoiding icebergs, slowly sailing through a lead, or by working with an icebreaker to follow a course through the ice to a destination.The Ice Navigation Manual, Witherby Publishing Group, p. 229‚Äì327 Additionally ships must also deal with the extreme cold of the climate in regions such as the poles; this involves removal of ice accumulation from the ship, as well as protecting the crew from the elements while working on the deck.The Ice Navigation Manual, Witherby Publishing Group, p. 201‚Äì226 Ships and their crews operating in ice will follow established rules of seamanship, as well as complying with national and international regulations such as the Polar Code. Areas of ice navigation Ice navigation occurs wherever a waterborne vessel transits through sea ice. One of the more common regions for ice navigation is the Baltic Sea, where vessels visiting the Baltic States will make their way through first year ice in the winter months, often with an Icebreaker, or with ice reports, charts and data provided by meteorological offices. Other areas include the Arctic Ocean, where increasing numbers of ships are transiting the region in the summer months for cruising and to transport cargo, as a result of oil and gas extraction in areas such as Yamal. The problems of increased shipping in polar regions presents additional challenges, including maritime safety concerns in the event that ice navigation is not carried out carefully. Ships will also pass through ice when navigating in the Antarctic, although most ships are either research vessels or cruise ships that have been especially ice strengthened. Other significant maritime regions where ships will navigate through Ice include the Saint Lawrence Seaway, around Greenland and the Canadian coast, the North Atlantic during iceberg season and through the Northwest Passage.The Ice Navigation Manual, Witherby Publishing Group, p. 49‚Äì108  Icing of superstructure  The accumulation of ice on the superstructure is a dangerous phenomenon. When the temperature is below slight icing will occur at winds of 5 Bft, moderate icing at 7 Bft, and severe icing at 8 Bft. When sailing in fresh water, icing will occur from and below. The more common causes of ice formation on the superstructure are from spray by wave crests and ship-generated spray. Other possibilities are snow fall, sea fog, a drastic fall in ambient temperature and also freezing raindrops in contact with the cold steel. The heading of the vessel relative to the wind and seas will determine which parts of the superstructure will ice first. Icing can immobilise equipment such as anchors or cause a dangerous list if the windward side of the vessel ices more heavily.  Ice detection by radar  A radar can be useful in detecting ice, but the returning signal which bounces off ice (even icebergs) is very faint, much lower than from ships. Conventional marine radars are designed for target detection and avoidance. Enhanced marine radars provide a higher definition image of the ice that the vessel is transmitting and will result in a much clearer image. This image can be used to identify the quantity and sort of ice that has to be dealt with. In standard radar, sea clutter affects the ability to see in the near vicinity of the vessel. An X-band radar set to a short pulse can give improved results. ReferencesBibliography * The Ice Navigation Manual (2010). Witherby Publishing Group. .

While the Mu'tazilite school generally was founded in Basra by Wasil ibn Ata, the Bishriyya follow the teachings of the Mu'tazili theologian and poet Bishr ibn al-Mu'tamir (d. 210 H / 825 CE).  Commonly held beliefs  While each sect has their own view on certain issues which differentiate them from the Mu'tazila. The following beliefs are some in which generally all Mu'tazila sects agreed: # \\"God is an eternal being and being such, eternity is his special characteristic.\\" Believing in the eternal attributes of God, they still follow the notion that what he says is preceded by his own being and is found in a time and place. They strongly believe in the denial of ascribing God with anthropomorphic characteristics. # \\"Man has power over his good and bad deeds and is also their creator.\\" The general consensus among adherents to both classical Mu'tazila ideology and the adherents of its subsets have the belief that due to the fact that man has control over his own body and actions that he is the one that deserves either the rewards or punishments for his time on Earth. # They believe that through repentance and a good lifestyle, upon entering the next life, one will be rewarded for their obedience. However, if one passes on unrepentant, then they will be eternally damned. # Finally, Mu'tazilites agree that humans should inherently know the difference between good and evil based on sense of reason. With that sense of reason, man is also expected to have a basic understanding of God.  Distinction from Mu'tazila  Specifically focusing on the Bishriyya school following the thoughts of Bishr ibn al-Mu'tamir, there were six distinctions between them and the general Mu'tazila doctrine. # They believed that senses like color, taste, and smell may stem from the secondary effects of man's actions. They've taken this from the naturalists at this time yet they differentiate themselves from these other thinkers by identifying a primary effect as opposed to a secondary effect. # \\"I do not maintain that man acts with this capacity in the first moment nor in the second moment; but I say that man acts, and the act does not take place except in the second moment.\\" This is saying that he believes in order to be judged according to your actions that you must be competent and within your true capacity. He defines capacity in such a way that you must be within full health- physically, mentally, and internally. # Bishr believes that although God's abilities to punish a child are well within His rights to use that he will not because in doing so he would be committing an act of injustice which God cannot do. He explains how a child, not being within his or her capacity, is incapable of deserving punishment due to the nature of not being able to make their own valid decisions. Were God to punish a child, He would be therefore punishing a child on the merits of an adult in a way that would be contradictory to the nature of God and the nature of punishment. # God's will is a will of His acts. Due to the nature of the Mu'tazili thought of a created Quran and a rationalistic approach to God, the Bishriyya follow a doctrine that God's will is therefore succeeding him in being. In the classic take on God's presence in the Islamic sense, God's word is co-eternal but as a subset of the Mu'tazila school, they believe in God preceding his creations and actions. # God's grace is something that would cause everyone to believe in God and therefore act in a way of deserving reward the same as which those who currently believe deserve reward, except even more in this case because of God's grace. It is important to note though, that while God has grace, God is not required to bestow his grace upon anyone ever. A very interesting aspect to this belief also is that God's goodness is never ending and the bestowment of his grace and goodness is without limit and God must choose. Seeing as there is no limit to how much good God can do, God can always do better and therefore he is not required to do the best because there is no such thing. However, God must provide man with the capacity to believe without inhibitors of belief. # The final major distinction of the Bishriyya is that they believed that if you commit a grave sin, repent, and then commit the same grave sin again, that you deserve not only punishment for the grave sin you just committed but also punishment for the first time you committed said sin because when you repented, you were forgiven of that sin on the basis that you would not commit the sin again.  Demise  As with most Islamic sectarian groups, this group's demise came about with the death of its founder. An interesting end to the entirety of the Mu'tazila comes from within when the Ash øari, a Sunni group, uses the same style of logic and reason to break apart the claims of the Mu'tazila.

The band's lineup has undergone many changes over the years, beginning with the successive deaths of two of their drummers, Canito (1979) and Pedro A. D√≠az (1984), both to traffic accidents. In their early years, the core of the band was made up of the three Urquijo brothers, √Ålvaro, Enrique, and Javier. Javier left the band in the mid-80's, and Enrique died of a drug overdose in 1999, leaving √Ålvaro as the sole remaining founding member. The band's current lineup consists of √Ålvaro Urquijo (vocals and guitars), Ram√≥n Arroyo (guitars), Jes√∫s Redondo (keyboards), Juanjo Ramos (bass), and Santi Fern√°ndez (drums). Alongside such bands as Nacha Pop, Mam√°, and Trastos, they were an integral part of the Spanish popular music revival which came to be known as \\"The New Wave of Madrid\\", and they have remained active for over thirty years; to this day they are considered to be one of the most important groups in the history of Spanish pop rock music. History=1978‚Äì1979: Tos In 1978, the Urquijo brothers Javier, Enrique, and √Ålvaro, together with drummer, composer, and singer Jos√© Enrique Cano, formed the band Tos. They were part of the explosion of creativity that took place in the music scene of Madrid at the time, while being influenced by various American country rock bands. In 1979, they recorded six demos that were later released as the EP Tos. On New Year's Eve of 1979, a traffic accident caused the death of Cano, thereby leading to the dissolution of the group. 1980‚Äì1985: Formation of Los Secretos In February 1980, a tribute concert to Canito was held in Madrid, which, in addition to the remaining members of Tos, included several groups from the \\"New Wave of Madrid\\", which later became subsumed in the movida madrile√±a movement. The Urquijo brothers decide to continue playing music together, and with drummer Pedro Antonio D√≠az, they relaunched the band under the name Los Secretos. They subsequently signed a recording deal with Polydor and recorded the 4-song EP Los Secretos. This was to be the forerunner of their first studio album, also titled Los Secretos, which was released in 1981. In the next two years, Los Secretos released two new albums, Todo sigue igual (Everything remains the same - 1982), and Algo m√°s (Something More - 1983). These were difficult years for the band, who received very little promotional support from their record company, and spent much of their time on the road. In May 1984, a traffic accident caused the death of Pedro Antonio D√≠az, the band's second drummer to die in similar circumstances. 1986‚Äì1988: Return In 1986, after a brief hiatus, Enrique decided to change the band's direction, this time with a more country orientation and without the presence of Javier. In this formation, Enrique focused exclusively on singing, and left bass duties to his brother Alvaro. The same year, the band released the 6-track album El primer cruce (The first crossing), with the contributions of Ram√≥n Arroyo on guitar, Nacho Lles on bass, and Steve Jordan on drums. The album Continuar√° (To be continued) came out in 1987, and 1988 saw the release of the band's first live recording, titled simply Directo (Live). This recording was the first to feature the band's current keyboardist Jes√∫s Redondo. Guest artists who collaborated on the album include Jos√© Mar√≠a Granados (Mam√°), Javier Teixidor (Mermelada), and Joaqu√≠n Sabina. Directo went on to garner the band their first gold record. 1989‚Äì1998: Years of stability The year 1989 saw the release of the band's sixth studio album, titled La calle del olvido (The street of oblivion). The group's membership also stabilized around this time, settling on a linup that would stay more or less the same for the next decade, with Enrique, √Ålvaro, Ram√≥n, and Jes√∫s. Nacho Lles had left during the recording of the album and Steve Jordan departed after the record was finished. The albums Adi√≥s tristeza (Goodbye sadness) and Cambio de planes (Change of plans) followed in 1991 and 1993 respectively. During this period, Enrique launched his side project Los Problemas, which allowed him to explore other musical styles. The group released their debut album in 1993, titled Enrique Urquijo y Los Problemas (Enrique and the problems), which included original songs as well as versions of songs by Los Secretos and other artists such as Nacha Pop, Radio Futura, and Alaska y los Pegamoides. Dos caras distintas (Two different faces), recorded in the UK, was released in 1995 and was the first Los Secretos album recorded outside of Spain. British session musicians were hired to fill in on bass and drums. The band's first compilation album, Grandes √©xitos (Big hits), came out in 1996. 1998 was a quiet year for the band as they each focused on other projects. √Ålvaro released a solo album titled √Ålvaro Urquijo, and Enrique's band Los Problemas issued their sophomore effort, Desde que no nos vemos (Since we haven't seen each other). 1999‚Äì2001: Death of Enrique and tribute album In 1999, Los Secretos prepared the launch of their second compilation album, Grandes √©xitos II. On the night of November 17 (precisely one day before the album was released), Enrique was found dead of a heroin overdose. This was a tremendous blow to the group, whose future appeared uncertain. In 2000, √Ålvaro, Ram√≥n, and Jes√∫s organized the recording of a tribute album to Enrique, titled A tu lado - Un homenaje a Enrique Urquijo (Next to you: a tribute to Enrique Urquijo), which featured the late musician's compositions as interpreted by the remaining three members of the band, accompanied by numerous guest musicians including Carlos Go√±i, Antonio Vega, Carlos Tarque, Ariel Rot, Celtas Cortos, C√≥mplices, Cristina Lliso, Javier √Ålvarez, David Summers Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Granados, Luz Casal, Manolo Tena, Miguel R√≠os, Mikel Erentxun, Nacho Campillo, Pau Don√©s, and Enrique's brother Javier Urquijo. 2002‚Äì2006: Return with √Ålvaro as frontman In 2002, Los Secretos returned to the studio to work on their first album following Enrique's death, with √Ålvaro in the lead. S√≥lo para escuchar (For listening only) was released that year. The following year saw the release of the band's second live album, titled Con cierto sentido (With some sense). They returned to the studio once again in 2006 to publish their eleventh studio album, Una y mil veces (One and a thousand times). 2007‚Äì2009: 30 years of Los Secretos In 2007, 30 years after their beginning as Tos, Los Secretos published a box set titled 30 a√±os (30 years), which included two CDs with old and new material, a booklet with the band's biography and discography, and two DVDs of collected videos. A live album was released in 2008, titled Gracias por elegirme - Las Ventas 10 de octubre de 2008 (Thank you for choosing me - Las Ventas, October 10, 2008). This concert was held at the famous bullring in Madrid to commemorate three decades of the band's existence, and included numerous contributions from guest artists. 2010‚Äìpresent Los Secretos released two studio albums in the 2010s: En este mundo raro (In this strange world) in 2011 and Algo prestado (Something borrowed) in 2015. The latter is a tribute to the artists that have inspired them throughout their career, including Graham Parker, Peter Gabriel, Nick Lowe, Gram Parsons, Foreigner, Ry Cooder], and Ron Sexsmith.

Built in 1846, it is one of the town's older surviving district school buildings, and now serves as a local community hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The District No. 4 School is located in a rural area of eastern Petersham, on the north side of East Road a short way west of its junction with Quaker Drive. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboarded exterior, and a stone foundation. The street-facing facade houses a single door, which provides access to the building. The side walls each have three windows. Trim consists of simple pilasters at the corners, and an entry surround with pilasters, transom window, and paneled entablature. A vertically oriented flagpole is attached above the door. The town of Petersham, incorporated in 1754, established a district school system consisting of thirteen districts. The present district 4 schoolhouse was built in 1846, and is one three school buildings from the 1840s to survive in the town. It was built on a site that had a schoolhouse on it since at least 1788, and was formally deeded to the local district in 1800. The present school was built as a replacement of a building constructed in 1803. District schools were formally abolished in Massachusetts in 1866, but this school remained open until 1943, the last in the town to be closed. The school building had a long history of use for local community functions, which continued after its educational functions ended.

The story has first appeared in 1915 in Reedy's Mirror. Short summary Rev. James Milligan goes for his morning bath. On his way to the bath he encounters an Egyptian Hornet in the hallway leading to the bathroom of the hotel he is staying in. At first the hornet frightens him. Then in his mind he describes the hornet in which, to his own disgust, he uses a more feminine erotic terminology. As he hesitates to enter the bathroom, another guest in the hotel Mr. Mullins, is getting impatient. As Rev. Milligan does not want to lose his bathing time he passes the hornet into the bathroom. After bathing he again hesitates when passing the hornet. As he hears Mr. Mullins come to the bathroom again he gets the idea of letting Mr. Mullins deal with the hornet. As Rev. Milligan goes to his room he listens in on what Mullins does, Mr. Mullins knocks the hornet to the floor and throws it out of the window. This shaming Rev. Milligan, as he the pious reverend should have at least warned Mr. Mullins, but rather he has wished the hornet the sting Mr. Mullins. Themes The reverend is described as an honest pious man, yet he constantly has bad sinful thoughts. And he leaves the problem to be solved by Mr. Mullins, whom he despises. In doing this the author writes that: 'All men, except those very big ones who are supermen, have something astonishingly despicable in them.' Then the reverend even wished for the hornet to sting Mr. Mullins. Hereby the author clearly shows that all men can do wrong, even the most pious and well respected men. For this the only requirement is that the situation allows them to. This whole scene also shows that despite the fact that Mr. Mullins is a drunkard he is superior to the reverend. As the latter shamefully acknowledges this in his thought. External links * * Full text.

She was the daughter of Peter Morey and Mary Morey. Accusation A complaint was first filed against Morey for \\"high suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft upon the body of Mary Walcott\\" along with George Burroughs, Lydia Dustin, Susannah Martin, Dorcas Hoar, and Phillip English. The accusations were primarily made by young girls within Salem village, including Abigail Williams, Mercy Lewis, Ann Putnam, Elizabeth Hubert, and Susannah Sheldon. A warrant for arrest followed soon after, issued on April 30, 1692 by judges John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin. Morey was examined and imprisoned along with Phillip English and Dorcas Hoar two days later on May 2 and remained in the Salem village jail house until February 1693. Conditions Conditions in the Salem village jail were abysmal for those accused of witchcraft. In addition to uncomfortably small cells which were often bleak, damp, and rat infested, prisoners were charged for each and every item used throughout their imprisonment, including straw bedding, food, and water. This had the potential to be a tremendous financial burden for those who were imprisoned who did not have a source of income; many were found innocent of witchcraft but died in jail due to the massive amounts of debt procured while awaiting their trial. Determined to recover her daughter from the possibility of this form of debtors' prison, Morey's mother Mary later filed a petition of restitution with a committee of the General Court seeking compensation for her daughter's thirty five weeks' diet while imprisoned, as well as several journeys to Boston and Salem. Many families affected by the trials followed suit in pressing for restitution, with the colony eventually passing a bill on October 17, 1711 clearing the names of the convicted and collectively presenting them and their families with around ¬£600. Verdict Morey was eventually tried and cleared of all charges.

Ballot selfies have risen in prominence alongside the increasing availability of smartphone digital cameras and the use of social media in the 21st century. They have also generated controversy as potential violations of laws enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to curtail vote buying, particularly in the United States, though some U.S. courts have rejected restrictions on ballot selfies as inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech. Voters typically take and share ballot selfies to encourage others to vote, to demonstrate their civic involvement, and to express their choice of candidate. The selfie is often taken in or near a voting booth and the ballot paper is often marked. Others do not take pictures of themselves in the voting booth, but photograph their ballots (including absentee ballots) or the voting machines, either before or after filling them out. Issues Several concerns have arisen over ballot selfies, typically focused on issues of ballot secrecy, voter fraud, and voter intimidation. These have led to laws prohibiting or restricting ballot selfies in some places, or the application or revision of existing laws to cover the practice, although enforcement has not been widespread in U.S. jurisdictions. Some authorities have indicated that prosecution would be unlikely unless there was some indication that the photograph was associated with voter fraud or intimidation or a vote-buying scheme.  Legality  Laws regarding ballot selfies vary by country and jurisdiction, often with laws varying by jurisdiction even within a country.  Brazil  Brazil's election laws ensure the secrecy of the vote; therefore, taking any photos of the voting machine (or, for that matter, using any electronic device while voting) is a crime subject to prison and a fine of up to R$15 thousand.  Canada  Elections Canada has encouraged voters to take selfies outside polling stations but cautioned against photos of marked ballots, as the Canada Elections Act makes it illegal to \\"show [a] ballot, when marked\\".  Germany  In federal elections for the Bundestag, taking a ballot selfie in the voting booth was prohibited in 2017 to preserve ballot secrecy and make vote buying and voter intimidation more difficult. If the voting commission notices a voter taking a ballot selfie, the ballot paper is not accepted. The voter will then be given a new ballot paper on request after destroying the old one.  The Netherlands  Ballot selfies are called stemfies in Dutch, literally \\"votefies\\". A platform for the protection of the rights of civilians sued the Dutch government in 2014 when minister of the interior and kingdom relations Ronald Plasterk said \\"I won't encourage anyone to take a ballot selfie, but it is allowed\\". The judge ruled that there is no law regarding ballot selfies and that it would not be up to the judge to say if it was wise of the minister to make statements the way he did.  United States  In the United States, there is no federal law regarding ballot selfies, leaving the matter to the individual states. Some U.S. states prohibit ballot selfies, imposing fines or jail terms for violations, while other states have no prohibition. In some states, laws prohibit photography at a polling place but do not restrict photographs of absentee ballots. The American Civil Liberties Union and others have questioned the constitutionality of prohibiting ballot selfies, arguing that they violate the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. Others, such as election-law expert Richard L. Hasen, consider such statutes to be \\"narrowly tailored ... to prevent vote buying\\" and thus constitutional, and argue that \\"without the ballot-selfie ban, we could see the reemergence of the buying and selling of votes ‚Äî and even potential coercion from employers, union bosses and others.\\" Supporters of ballot selfies, by contrast, argue that the taking and sharing of such photos is positive for democracy; for example, law professor Paul Bender has suggested that selfies might increase voter turnout. In Tennessee, entertainer Justin Timberlake came under fire for a ballot selfie he took, though the state did not take legal action. = Constitutional challenges against bans= Indiana's ban was enjoined on October 19, 2015 by a preliminary injunction by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. New Hampshire's ban on ballot selfies was ruled facially unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in September 2016 in the case Rideout v. Gardner.Recent Case: Rideout v. Gardner: First Circuit Strikes Down State Ban on Ballot Selfies, 130 Harv. L. Rev. 1728 (2017). The case was brought by the ACLU, with the support of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and Snapchat, which were among the groups filing amicus briefs in support of the challenge. The court held that the statute's stated justification, to prevent vote-buying or voter coercion, was not sufficient to sustain the restriction on speech, because \\"digital photography, the Internet, and social media are not unknown quantities -- they have been ubiquitous for several election cycles, without being shown to have the effect of furthering vote buying or voter intimidation.\\" The court thus determined that New Hampshire's law \\"is facially unconstitutional even applying only intermediate scrutiny\\" due to the \\"substantial mismatch between New Hampshire's objectives and the ballot-selfie prohibition.\\" The state sought review by the Supreme Court, but in April 2017 the Court refused to hear the case, leaving the First Circuit's decision intact. Michigan's ban was enjoined by a preliminary injunction in late October 2016 by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, but that injunction was stayed in early November 2016 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which in a 2-1 decision allowed the ban to remain in place. On May 8, 2019 the Michigan Sec. of State settle the case. Michigan now allows for taking pictures of your ballot inside the voting booth, but not pictures of yourself. New York's ban on photographing and displaying marked ballots, first enacted in 1890, was upheld in a September 2017 decision in the case Silberberg v. Board of Elections by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Applying strict scrutiny, the court held that the state had a compelling interest in preventing vote buying and voter coercion and that the law was narrowly tailored to meet this interest. =Laws by state= Most state laws making it a crime to photograph marked ballots were enacted as reform efforts in the early 20th century, as part of a broader campaign that saw the introduction of the secret ballot and the enactment of \\"other laws intended to prevent voter corruption and intimidation.\\" Many such laws remain in force even though \\"the outright buying of votes has receded as a significant issue.\\" Jurisdictions that currently prohibit ballot selfies are Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Illinois's laws are the strictest of all. While most states with anti-ballot selfie laws make the offense a misdemeanor punishable by a fine, in Illinois, taking a ballot selfie is a felony punishable by 1‚Äì3 years in prison. Jurisdictions that currently allow ballot selfies or do not enforce laws against them are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia.https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/politics/hickenlooper-signs- colorado-bill-allowing-ballot-selfies https://www.kpbs.org/news/2018/may/18/want-snap-ballot-selfie-election-now- its-legal/ Jurisdictions where the law is currently unclear are Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia.

Shortly after completing the general theory of relativity, Einstein applied his new theory of gravity to the universe as a whole. Assuming a universe that was static in time, and possessed of a uniform distribution of matter on the largest scales, Einstein was led to a finite, static universe of spherical spatial curvature. To achieve a consistent solution to the Einstein field equations for the case of a static universe with a non-zero density of matter, Einstein found it necessary to introduce a new term to the field equations, the cosmological constant. In the resulting model, the radius R and density of matter œÅ of the universe were related to the cosmological constant Œõ according to Œõ = 1/R2 = Œ∫œÅ/2, where Œ∫ is the Einstein gravitational constant. Following the discovery by Edwin Hubble of a linear relation between the redshifts of the galaxies and their distance in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe and proposed expanding models such as the Friedmann-Einstein universe and the Einstein‚Äìde Sitter universe. In both cases, he set the cosmological constant to zero, declaring it \\"no longer necessary ... and theoretically unsatisfactory\\". And he considered as his biggest blunder.

It was once believed that this construction was as old as the 12th century, but most modern historians maintain that the first abwurfdachs were constructed around 1550.  Medieval '  In the 19th century architectural historians, such as , developed the idea that, in the 12th century, the main buildings of a castle were universally topped by fighting platforms that were only covered by a \\"temporary\\" and easily dismantled protective roof. These temporary structures, known as ' were supposed to have covered fortifications such as the as well as residential buildings like the ' and would have been quickly removed in the event of a siege so that catapults could be erected on the fighting terraces in order to defend the castle. This perspective was already being doubted by castle researcher, , as \\"something that could be imagined as practical, but which does not always reflect reality.\\"Piper, Otto: Burgenkunde. Bauwesen und Geschichte der Burgen. W√ºrzburg 1912, p. 392. Piper points out, among other things, that there are no medieval sources that speak about ', but several reports of sieges mentioning that enemy shells were destroying the roofs of a castle, accounts which suggest that the castles had more conventional solid roof structures. More recent castle research also suggests that the majority of the Central European castles were not designed for large-scale sieges, but rather against minor or surprise attacks. Since most castles were not built merely to provide the military function of a fortress, but at the same time were residences of the nobility, provisional roofs are unlikely to have been normal. In addition, hardly anything is known about the roof structures of high medieval castles, since they were generally rebuilt in later times, or have not survived in the case of ruined castles.  ' in early modern fortresses  From about 1550 onwards, however, there is historical evidence of the actual use of such roof structures in fortifications. In the sphere of influence of the Franconian free imperial city of Nuremberg some ' have survived to the present or been reconstructed. For instance, some cavaliers and bastions at the imperial city fortress of Lichtenau at are topped by such constructions. Numerous corbels on the curtain walls indicate the intention to build removable roofs, but contemporary illustrations show that these plans did not come fully to fruition. A bird's eye view at the time of the Thirty Years' War (around 1630, Swedish State Archives) portrays a defensive system with removable roofs on four of the five bastions. The three cavaliers also have correspondingly open superstructures. No roofs can be seen above the curtain walls. This illustration view largely corresponds to the present state of this Renaissance fortress. In the reconstruction of Nuremberg's city walls, that largely survived until the Second World War, several sections of the wall were re-covered in this way. The posts of the roof trusses also rest on stone columns, which jut out of the wall line (') or are placed on the cornices. These Nuremberg forerunners were copied by other Franconian and Swabian imperial cities, for example in the fortifications of and the ' bastion of . The history of this type of building remains largely unexplored by serious historians. Even in contemporary Italian fortress construction, removable roofs or light roof structures have been documented e.g. at the in Florence. In the sixteenth century, Franconian military engineers leant heavily on Italian innovations.  References  Literature  * Daniel Burger: Festungen in Bayern. Regensburg, 2008.

Origins and opening The Thrum Hall cricket ground had a speedway dirt track constructed around the cricket pitch and hosted the Halifax Speedway team until 1930.Defunct Speedway - Thrum Hall A greyhound track replaced the speedway the following year with the greyhound track taking a most unusual shape in the form of a D shape to allow the cricket ground to remain in place inside the circuit. The first race meeting on Spring Hall Lane was held on 7 November 1931 and the first runner past the winning line was a 4-1 shot called Unconscious. The first distances included 300, 480 and 500 yards (mainly handicaps) and the Manager Director was H.Wood. History It was not until after the war that the stadium was known as the Halifax Greyhound Stadium and improvements resulted in the venue being able to accommodate between 3,000 and 5,000 spectators during Monday and Thursday racing. The track remained independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) for 44 years before the move was made to become affiliated with the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) in 1975. Facilities by now also included a licensed bar and snack bar, racing was held on Monday and Friday evenings at 7.30pm and trial sessions took place on Sunday mornings. The track was all-grass and race distances of 352 and 490 yards (mainly handicaps) were the featured events. The change to NGRC racing was under the new permit scheme which enabled smaller tracks to race under rules at reduced costs. No less than six new tracks joined the NGRC permit scheme in 1975 and Halifax owners Jack Wardman and Jon Carter (an Owlerton Stadium director) ensured Halifax became one of them. Wardman introduced a festival of racing in 1975 which attracted some of the North's best dogs. Just one year later Jon Carter bought a 50% stake in the track with the other 50% being bought by a syndicate of ten that included Barbara Fearn wife of NGRC steward Alan Fearn. In 1978 another change of ownership took place, David Collins a local businessman was the latest buyer and installed photo finish and ray timing for the first time as well as building a new clubhouse for the patrons. Closure Despite all of the work from Collins the greyhound racing ceased to run under NGRC rules in 1979. Halifax RLFC sold the site for ¬£1.5 million to Asda in 1998 which now stands in place of the entire sports grounds today.

Although the plate was found on the Caribbean coast, it may have been made in Tikal. The plate is now in the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, Netherlands, hence its official name. It is one of the oldest Maya objects using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.Michael D. Coe, The Maya (7th ed.), Thames & Hudson, 2005, p. 87  History  The plate was discovered by chance by a Dutch engineer, S.A. van Braam, in 1834. He was part of a team employed by a lumber company to dig a canal near present-day Puerto Barrios, in the lower Motagua Valley, a border area of Guatemala and Honduras. The team transected what looked like an ancient Central-American funeral mound. There, together with copper bells and pottery fragments, the little jade plate was found. The plate was brought back to the Netherlands in 1864 and was gifted to the National Museum of Ethnology. The first scientific description of the plate was made by Leeman in 1877, and many others followed, notably Holden in 1880 and Valentine in 1881, who started deciphering the inscriptions. A lot of ground work on the dating of the plate was done in 1938 by Frances and Sylvanus Morley. Their study remains one of the more conclusive made on the plate. The date on the plate was used to study time and calendar in the Maya world, and the plate remains one of the earliest examples of the usage of a cyclical calendar in the Central-American world. It is remarkable for being the oldest known usage of a Maya ordinal zero,Andr√© Cauty, Jean-Michel Hoppan, Et un, et deux z√©ros mayas, in Pour la science, Dossier math√©matiques exotiques, April/June 2005. which symbol (graphically derived from the drawing of a sitting man, typically representing a king's crowning) appears two times, one to form the date \\"0 Yaxkin\\" from the first day of the seventh month of the festive year in Haab' calendar, and one to denote the Moon-Bird king accessing its throne on the other side of the plaque.  Description  Carving on the Leiden Plate The plaque is a small rectangular object of pale green jadeite measuring 21.7 by 8.6 centimeters. Its faces are carved with both drawings and glyphs. A hole at its top hints that it was used as a pendant, probably as a waist plate. While it was found far from its possible original location of Tikal in a post-classic archeological context,√àric Taladoire & Brigitte Faug√®re-Kalfon, Arch√©ologie et art pr√©colombiens: la M√©soam√©rique, √âcole du Louvre, 1995, p. 155 it dates from the Early Classic era. It poses as an example of precious object preserved and used several centuries after its making, which is common in Mesoamerica. The front face has a picture of a richly-dressed man. His head and the lower part of his body are seen from profile, but his breast is turned toward the front, with the feet placed one behind the other. It represents a victorious lord, possibly an otherwise- unknown ruler of Tikal, wearing six celts and some trophy heads around his waist, standing with bound captives he vanquished. He also carries an atlatl, or two head serpent, in his hand. The serpents have a human head in their mouth, a characteristic feature of the Sun God. The motif of the inauguration of a ruler depicted on the Leiden Plate is a common one, similar carvings being found on stelae and other celts around the Maya world. The plaque's posterior face has been engraved with an inscription bearing traces of cinnabar, documenting the crowning of a king on 15 September 320 (Gregorian) in the Long Count calendar, one of the earliest registered dates of the Maya Classic period. The inscription is composed of fifteen glyphs neatly carved in one column. The date written is 8.14.3.1.12 1 Eb 0 Yaxk'in (15 September 320 A.D. using the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation). The plate probably represents the accession of a ruler. This accession may have happened at the Moon-Zero-Bird Place and involved a ruler named Way Ko? Chanal Chak Wak.

Formerly, its original archaeological context was shown as well, but for unknown reasons, this has been removed from the permanent exhibition. The Leyden Plaque is the most recognisable object of the museum collection, with replicas gifted to museums, politicians and organisations around the world. Its image is also featured on the one quetzal bank note, the Guatemalan currency unit, after it was chosen as one of the national symbols of Guatemala in 2006. Some controversy exists regarding the object's ownership. During the 1988 \\"Blood of Kings\\" Maya exhibition in the Kimbell Art Museum, Texas, the National Museum of Ethnology of Leiden asked for a Declaration of Immunity From Public Seizure in order to protect the plate from being seized by a third party. It is highly doubtful, however, if the object could legitimately and legally be classified as \\"looted art\\"; in the opposite case, 2020 Dutch policy guidelines would make its repatriation to Guatemala almost inescapable.

Aetna by Sarah Cole Sarah Cole (1805-1857) was an American landscape painter and the sister of prominent American landscape painter Thomas Cole. Many of Cole‚Äôs paintings are similar in subject and visuals to her brother‚Äôs. Though she was one of the earliest female landscape painters working in the United States, little is known of her life, and very few of her works have survived or can be located today.  Early life  Though Cole spent most of her life in America, she was born in Lancashire, England. Her parents, James and Mary Cole, had six other children aside from her and Thomas, all daughters. Thomas was the seventh of the eight children, and Sarah was the youngest. In 1818, her parents immigrated to the United States with four of their children, the sisters Ann, Mary, and Sarah, their brother Thomas, and an aunt.Vittoria, Shannon (2018). \\"Chronology\\". In: Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser and Tim Barringer, Thomas Cole's Journey: Atlantic Crossings. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art. Distributed by Yale University Press. . p. 246. The family arrived in Philadelphia in July, and moved to Steubenville, Ohio, in September of the same year, except for Thomas, who remained in Philadelphia for a year before joining the family in Steubenville. In Steubenville, Ann and Mary opened a seminary where Sarah may have also eventually taught. In 1824, the family moved to Pittsburgh. The next year, they moved to New York City, where Sarah likely lived for the rest of her life, often visiting Catskill where she would join Thomas on hikes in the Catskill Mountains. Sarah also occasionally visited family and friends in Baltimore.  Career and Paintings  It is not known when Sarah Cole began to make art, though she first mentions that she is painting in letters to her brother in the mid 1830s. She exhibited her paintings publicly only after the death of Thomas in February 1848, most likely to help support herself financially. The National Academy of Design in New York City displayed her work from 1848 to 1852, and her works also appeared in the American Art-Union and the Maryland Historical Society during her lifetime. Titles of these canvases indicate original, rather than copied, subjects. The majority of her exhibited paintings are now lost. Two of Sarah Cole‚Äôs paintings that can be found today are on display in the Albany Institute of History and Art in Albany, New York. The paintings are A View of the Catskill Mountain House, a scene of the titular white house on a hill covered with fall foliage and a small seated figure on the ground looking up at it, and Mount Aetna, a view of the mountain in the background with a landscape and people praying to a shrine of an icon. A note on the back of the canvas of the Catskill Mountain House painting indicates that it was copied from a painting by Thomas Cole. A View of the Catskill Mountain House is nearly identical to her brother‚Äôs painting of the same subject. Mount Aetna is not a direct copy but it is likewise similar to her brother‚Äôs style. Another painting by Sarah Cole, Ancient Column Near Syracuse (1848), depicts a landscape with a Neoclassical theme. It pictures a person with some animals on a green field in front of ancient ruins. The Thomas Cole National Historic Site in the Catskills also houses her paintings Duffield Church, English Landscape, and Landscape with Church. In addition to being a painter, Sarah made etchings. She was trained in etching by the painter and engraver Asher B. Durand. None of her etchings survive today but in 1888, decades after her death, New York‚Äôs Union League Club held an exhibition called ‚ÄúWomen Etchers of America‚Äù that included some of her work. All of the other exhibitors in that show were living artists. Sarah Cole died in 1857, spending her final days in Catskill, New York.

Nelson (1933-1997) was a former Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) (February 22, 1982 to June 16, 1989) under the administration of then United States President Ronald Reagan, and co-author of the original proposal behind California Proposition 187 (passed November 1994).  Early life and education  Nelson was born in Oakland, California. Nelson obtained an undergraduate degree in business administration from the University of California, Berkeley, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley Law School in 1958.  Career = Before September 1981: California government and private sector law  Before September 1981, Nelson had worked in both the California state government and the private sector. * 1958‚Äì1964: Attorney at the law firm of Rogers, Clark & Jordan * 1964‚Äì1969: Deputy District Attorney for Alameda County, California.

Nelson played an important part in Reagan's welfare reform efforts. He also served as Chairman of the California Governor's Committee for Employment of the Handicapped. He received numerous awards from various public and private organizations for his role in working with the handicapped in California.  September 1981 to February 1982: Transition from Deputy Commissioner to Commissioner of the INS  On September 23, 1981, Nelson assumed the position of Deputy Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), to which he was appointed by then United States Attorney General William French Smith. At the time, INS had not had an appointed Commissioner since Leonel Castillo's resignation in September 1979, and it had been run under Acting Commissioner David W. Crosland and later Doris Meissner. Reagan's first nominee for INS Commissioner had been Norman Braman, but Braman withdrew his nomination on November 12, 1981 citing his desire to spend more time on his automobile business in Florida. On November 17, 1981, Reagan announced the nomination of Nelson for the position of INS Commissioner. The plan was for Meissner, who was Acting Commissioner at the time, to change to the role of Deputy Commissioner once Nelson was appointed. Reagan's choice of Nelson was welcomed by Michael G. Harpold, head of the National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council, the union representing INS workers. Harpold noted that the nominee's close relationship with the White House (and specifically with Edwin Meese) would elevate the status of INS as an organization. Nelson's appointment as INS Commissioner was confirmed by unanimous consent of the United States Senate on February 8, 1982, and he assumed the office on February 22, 1982. Meissner moved to the role of Executive Associate Commissioner.  February 1982 to June 1989: Work as INS Commissioner  Nelson 's tenure at the INS was marked by significant changes to the organization. In 1983, the INS under Nelson began working with the United States Catholic Conference on amnesty, with the Catholic Conference seeking to play the role of guiding aliens in applying for amnesty and representing them as de facto lawyers. The amnesty program was finally passed as part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, that additionally imposed employer sanctions and enhanced border security. The INS under Nelson implemented these provisions. As part of this, Nelson opened more than 100 new field offices to process amnesty requests, beefed up the United States Border Patrol, and began work on the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program intended to help government agencies deny benefits to aliens who were not eligible for them. Nelson also announced in October 1987, and subsequently implemented, the INS' \\"Family Fairness\\" executive action. Under Nelson's leadership, the agency grew by $650 million to more than $1 billion and the staff swelled by 6,000 to a total of about 17,500. In 1989, the United States Department of Justice, under United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh (who had taken office in 1988 under President Reagan and continued in office under George H. W. Bush), conducted an audit of the INS. Aides to Thornburgh told The New York Times in March 1989 that Thornburgh was eager to replace Nelson and bring the INS more firmly under his own control. The audit revealed a range of alleged problems around agency mismanagement, including 23,000 citizenship certificates lost by the regional agency in Miami (officials claimed all but 5% of the lost certificates were found), $1500 spent on an oil portrait of Nelson, and unclear accounting, management, and administrative practices. The audit also noted a growing backlog in cases awaiting decisions. Nelson was fired from his post, with his last day as INS Commissioner on June 16, 1989. Deputy INS Commissioner James L. Buck was named acting head of the service, and Gene McNary was rumored to be the next nominee for the role. Nelson continued on at the INS in a Consultant role for a few more months, to help with a successful transition to his successor. McNary assumed the office of INS Commissioner on October 26, 1989.  Political activism  After finishing his work at the INS, Nelson resumed private law practice in California. Amidst growing concern in California about illegal immigration from Asia and Latin America, he worked with Harold W. Ezell to come up with a proposal to bar illegal immigrants from receiving an array of public benefits, from education to health care. This proposal went on the California ballot as California Proposition 187 in November 1994, and passed comfortably. However, some of the provisions were challenged and got tied up in the courts later. In 1995, Nelson leveraged his knowledge in immigration law and experience at the INS to work with Julie Pearl, an immigration attorney in the Bay Area, to co- found Pearl Law Group (now Pearl Immigration) and focus on global immigration, I-9 compliance, and mobility management for companies. In the following years, Nelson contributed to help develop the framework to ImmigrationTracker, an immigration management software for use by law firms and enterprise organizations in the United States.  Death  Nelson died on January 29, 1997 in Sacramento, California. At the time of his death, Nelson had been married to JoAnn Wallen Nelson for 37 years. The couple had three daughters, Kristy Nelson Leffers, Kathy Turner and Karin Nelson, and one granddaughter.

In 1914, Evans graduated from Wheeling's Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy, before attending Pittsburgh's Carnegie Institute of Technology School of Fine Arts, and then the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. In 1924, she received a fellowship to the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, which included a brief residency at Tiffany's Mansion, Laurelton Hall, on Oyster Bay, Long Island, where Evans worked with leading painters such as Childe Hassam, Charles Webster Hawthorne, and Gari Melchers. From 1926 to 1931, Evans made four trips to Europe, including studying at the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts in France during the summer of 1926. Evans was deeply involved in advocating for female artists. She was active in the West Virginia Federation of Women's Clubs and the Wheeling Art Club. In 1957, Evans moved to Orlando, Florida before relocating to Naples, Florida two years later. In Naples, she became a leading member and teacher at the Naples Art Association. but she returned to West Virginia in 1974 to spend the rest of her life with her family. She died in 1983 in Moundsville, West Virginia. Painting Evans debuted her paintings in the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh's juried exhibits in 1923. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, paintings from her various European trips were exhibited in Wheeling, Pittsburgh, and New York City. Her paintings were widely displayed through the eastern U.S. during the 1930s. In a time when women rarely traveled alone, Evans traveled through the eastern U.S. and northern Europe. After her 1926 trip to study in France, Evans visited Europe again in 1928, 1929, and 1931, visiting Portugal, Spain, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Belgium, and Germany. In 1931, for her fourth voyage across the Atlantic ocean, Evans traveled as the sole passenger on a merchant freighter with thirty-four sailors. She chose the slower merchant vessel rather than a passenger liner in order to \\"study the ocean.\\" Evans also showed little regard for the social conventions of her era, focusing instead on professional accomplishments and artistic success. For these reasons, many regarded her with suspicion or scorn. Evans showed work in the 1933 exhibit \\"The American Scene\\" at the John Herron Institute (now the Indianapolis Museum of Art) alongside artists Charles Davis, William Forsyth, Grant Wood, John Steuart Curry, Clifton Wheeler, and Zoltan Sepeshy. She also exhibited work in annual shows by the Tiffany Foundation Fellows in New York, and Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. She was elected to the Society of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1931. Also during the early 1930s, Evans' paintings were featured in solo exhibits at New York's Studio Guild and the New York Public Library. After a shift to glass work during throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, Evans returned to painting in the late 1950s when she moved to Florida. The work she created during this time included abstract and traditional works, as well as experimental landscapes. In 1968, Evans work was displayed in a solo exhibit at the Oglebay Institute, in Wheeling. She also won a 1972 commission, worth $1,000, for West Virginia's Permanent Art Collection. Imperial Glass Corporation and Glass Arts Evans' career shifted in 1942 when the Imperial Glass Corporation of Bellaire, Ohio hired her to design glass products for a new line. Her Asian inspired designs included dragon and butterfly motifs, used on a line of more than thirty Imperial Cathay Crystal items ranging from candle holders to ashtrays. One piece of Evans' Cathay Crystal glasswork was displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art during its April 1950 special display Twentieth Century Glass, American and European. Evans also designed for Viking Glass, Fostoria, Imperial and Warwick, and other Ohio Valley glass companies. External links * Gallery Images of Virginia B.

Fur trader Denig was the son of a prosperous county doctor, yet he chose to dedicate his adult life to the fur trade. In 1833 he entered into the service of the American Fur Company as a clerk, first at Fort Pierre, and from 1837 at Fort Union. There he rose from bookkeeper to chief clerk, and finally Bourgeois (superintendent of the post and profit-sharing partner). At Fort Union Denig aided various visiting scholars, including John James Audubon, collected scientific specimens, and also collected diverse specimens for the Smithsonian Institution.Hewitt 1930.Ewers 1961, p. xiv-xvii. Ethnographer On the initiative of Father De Smet, Denig began in 1851 to write descriptions of Plains Indian culture that later was included in De Smets writings. Denig also assembled data for Henry Schoolcraft, later included in this scholar's writings. A later report by Denig on the Assiniboine was published in 1930 as Indian Tribes of the Missouri. A later manuscript lay dormant in the archives, until it was published in 1961 as Five Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri.Ewers 1961, pp. xviii, xxii-xxiii, xxviii. Personal life Denig entered into several \\"country marriages\\" with Native American women. His first marriage was to Sina Wamniomi (Whirlwind Blanket), a Lakota, with whom he had a son, Robert, and a daughter, Sarah. His second marriage, in 1837, was with Hai-kees-kak-wee-yah (Deer Little Woman), an Assiniboine, with whom he had one son, Alexander, and two daughters, Ida and Adeline. The first wife stayed at Fort Pierre, but the son was with his father and the second wife at Fort Union. Denig also married the second wife's younger sister in a polygamous union, that eventually ended when the younger sister moved away. The marriage with the second wife was formalized in 1855 through a Catholic ceremony in St. Louis. In 1856 he moved with her and their three children to Selkirk Settlement, where the children were placed in Catholic schools. Denig was here active as an independent fur trader, but died of appendicitis in 1858.Ewers 1961, p. xxiii-xxv.Barbour 2001, p. 129. References=NotesCited literature * Barbour, Barton H. (2001).

His travels and association with avant-garde writers in France, Cuba, and New York compelled him to reinvigorate the Dominican poetic sensibility by rejecting formal models and rhyme, being the first poet to introduce free verse in Dominican letters with his poem, Arabesco (1917). Early life Diaz was born in Santo Domingo on April 6, 1880, the son of Francisco Vigil and Isabel D√≠az. He studied in primary and secondary school in Santo Domingo, but did not continue to university. He was seen as capricious, eccentric, perhaps lonely and self- centered, though little is known about his life. Literary career Greatly influenced by the French literature of that era, Diaz‚Äôs travels to Paris, New York, and Cuba in the early years of the twentieth century marked his literary production. He was 32 years old when he published his first book, G√≥ndolas, of prose poetry. Since the beginning of his literary career, Diaz was tied to the postumismo literary movement, however aesthetic differences led him to outright reject any association with the Dominican literary trend also developing at this time. Diaz's opinionated poems and essays were published in a multitude of journals, including Cromos, Letras, La Cuna de Am√©rica, Renacimiento, Cosmopolita, Bahoruco, El d√≠a √©tico and Blanco y Negro. For many years, he wrote the \\"Fatamorgana\\" column, which first appeared in the List√≠n Diario, later in La opini√≥n and finally in La Naci√≥n. As the story goes, after the death of Jules Vedrines, the French aviator who had acquired fame on his Paris-Madrid flight for having created the dangerous aerial pirouettes of 'looping the loop', Vigil D√≠az, pursuing more experimental forms, named his new sensibility vedrinismo; however, there are doubts as to, if ever, Diaz used the word vedrinismo to designate any trend or literary avant-garde headed by him. His most famous work, Arabesco, published in November of 1917 in the literary journal La Primada de Am√©rica, is remembered as the first introduction of free verse poetry in Dominican literary history. Diaz died in Santo Domingo on January 20, 1961.

The band currently consists of vocalist and guitarist Craig Dermody, bassist Jack Farley and drummer Joe Alexander. Dermody is also the principle songwriter and founder, and by 2013, the band had undergone numerous line-up changes with \\"30 or 40 people in total\\" having joined. The band's name is taken from the 1987 wedding between Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell (played by Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue, respectively) on the Australian soap opera Neighbours. Dermody stated: \\"I remember sitting down and watching it with my mum. ... I remember the wedding being massive, it was as if it was a real wedding. Like a royal wedding, but in Australia.\\" When asked if he actually liked the show, Dermody responded, \\"No, I hate Neighbours. It was just for a bogan reference. I used to watch it with my mum when I was young so it reminds me of Adelaide\\". History The band were formed in 2006 in Melbourne by Craig Dermody, who had been a member of various bands including Lindsey Low Hand, Spider Vomit and Divorced with whom he had released albums on various independent Australian labels. Dermody self-released the band's debut album in 2010 Para Vista Social Club on vinyl only, via his own label Untapped Resources. It was recorded with guitarist Luke Horton, bassist Jarrod Quarrel and drummer Dion Nania who usually played guitar with Melbourne band Panel of Judges.http://messandnoise.com/features/4027580 The album was released as a limited edition of 200 copies in second-hand album covers which he painted over by hand. The song Epping Line \\"is about hearing news of my mother passing away. Those big moments are important as song subjects and the songs are important to help me get through those big moments\\". In 2010, Dermody relocated from Melbourne to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, revealing that he \\"was just after a bit of a life change. I'd just done what I was doing, and it was just time for me to go there, I guess ‚Äì I'd always wanted to\\". The following year the album was released internationally by London-based label Critical Heights and re-issued in Australia on Bedroom Suck Records. Dermody admitted that \\"the fact that it has been re-issued is pleasant surprise to me\\" and that \\"at the time my painting career was going a lot better than my music career\\". Whilst based in Williamsburg, he formed a new lineup of the band but admitted that he found it difficult to find band members at first or to get gig bookings. Former drummer Dion Nania re-located with Dermody and moved back on to guitar, bassist Karla Way from Beaches and guitarist Antonia Sellbach from Love of Diagrams and Beaches were also recruited. The band recorded the Two Weeks EP, which was released in early 2013 on 10\\" vinyl via Critical Heights. In 2013, the band signed to Fire Records after the label heard them through their Bandcamp page, and released second album Any Port In A Storm. The album was recorded with another lineup of the band featuring guitarist Michael Caterer, drummer Michael Mimoun and bassist Ian Savage. Written and recorded whilst in New York City, Dermody stated that \\"most of the inspiration came from my pretty standard places, girls, crap jobs and the place that I was living in\\". The band toured the album worldwide, with longterm friend and producer Jack Farlay on bass. In September 2014, the band released the cassette only mini-album Back On The Tools, and the following year released the Australian-only EP Delivered (later issued worldwide via Fire Records in 2016). In October 2016, the band released their third album Mid Thirties Single Scene. Commenting on writing the album, Dermody revealed that \\"I've been writing a lot about stuff happening in life at the moment, moving back to Melbourne and trying to adjust to all of that. My father passed away during the period of writing so that's in there and girls, girls are in there\\". Now back in Melbourne, the band consists of long-time friends and former band members, bassist Jack Farley, guitarist/backing vocalist Gill Tucker, drummer Joe Alexander (also owner of Bedroom Suck Records) and occasionally keyboardist/backing vocalist Esther Edquist. The band embarked on a world tour, taking in the UK, mainland Europe and Japan.http://www.firerecords.com/scott-charlenes-wedding-announce-first-leg- of-ukeu- tour/https://www.facebook.com/sacwmusic/photos/a.331733016925735.74644.331730876925949/1067376633361366/?type=1&theater;http://deadfunnyrecords.com/tour/scott- charlenes-wedding-japan-tour-2016/ Tucker left the band in June 2017.https://www.facebook.com/sacwmusic/photos/a.332061466892890.74717.331730876925949/1367208490044844/?type=3&theater; Members ;Current members * Craig Dermody - lead vocals, guitar * Ella Styles - guitar, vocals * Jack Farley - bass * Joe Alexander - drums ;Former members * Michael Caterer - guitar * Michael Mimoun - drums * Ian Savage - bass * Dion Nania - guitar/drums * Karla Way - bass * Antonia Sellbach - guitar * Luke Horton - guitar * Jarrod Quarrel - bass * Gill Tucker - guitar, backing vocals * Esther Edquist - keyboards, backing vocals Discography=Albums * Para Vista Social Club (2010) * Any Port In A Storm (2013) * Mid Thirties Single Scene (2016) EPs/Mini-Albums * Two Weeks (2013) * Back On The Tools (2014) * Delivered (2015) ReferencesExternal links *Official Facebook Category:Australian indie rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 2006 ","title":"Scott &amp; Charlene's Wedding"},{"id":"52086414","text":"A Prospect of Coppeed Hall at Totteridge in the County of Hertford seat of Joseph Da Costa, Esq. 1739.Badeslade & Roqeu, Vitruvius Brittanicus, Vol. IV, 1739. Fernando Joseph da Costa (1683‚Äì1753) was a member of a wealthy family of merchants in London of Portuguese-Jewish origins, and the son of Alvaro Jacob da Costa, sometimes considered the founder of the Anglo-Sephardi community in London. He was able to buy Copped Hall in Totteridge, Hertfordshire, and thus became the lord of the Manor of Copped Hall. Early life and family Da Costa was born in 1683, the second son of Alvaro Jacob (Rodrigues) da Costa (1646‚Äì1716), sometimes considered the founder of the Anglo-Sephardi community in London, and Leonor Mendes Guti√©rres (1651‚Äì1727).

Their daughter Catherine (Kitty) (1709-1746), married Joseph (Isaac) da Costa Villareal who died three years later. She then married William Mellish, member of Parliament for East Retford but was sued for breach of promise by her cousin Jacob (Philip) Mendes da Costa.

Career The da Costa family had extensive mercantile interests that included the import of diamonds from India, wood from the Azores, and the export of coral from Italy to India. They were brokers for customers in European trading centres and shippers of bullion. Houses In 1716, da Costa inherited a house in Budge Row, London, on the death of his father. By 1722, he owned Copped Hall (or Coppeed Hall) in Totteridge, Hertfordshire and was lord of the manor of Copped Hall. The house in Totteridge had extensive grounds and was significant enough to appear in Badeslade and Roqeu's Vitruvius Brittanicus in 1739. In 1758 the house was sold to Abraham Chambers, London Banker. Death Da Costa died in 1753.  References  External links  *Elizabeth Sarah Villa-Real ‚Äì Mrs Gooch. All Things Georgian.

Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. Research Erturk leads the Smart Structures and Dynamical Systems Laboratory at Georgia Tech. His publications are mostly in the areas of dynamics and vibration of smart structures and energy harvesting. Erturk made fundamental contributions in the field of energy harvesting from dynamical systems. His distributed-parameter piezoelectric energy harvester models have been widely used by several research groups. He was one of the first researchers to explore nonlinear dynamic phenomena for frequency bandwidth enhancement in energy harvesting, specifically by using a bistable Duffing oscillator with electromechanical coupling, namely the piezomagnetoelastic energy harvester. His early energy harvesting work also opened new multiphysics avenues, such as the use of aeroelastic flutter to enable scalable airflow energy harvesting through piezoaeroelastic systems. His recent collaborative work aims to exploit flexoelectricity (strain gradient-induced polarization) for the enhancement of energy harvesting at the nanoscale. Erturk's group at Georgia Tech also contributed to smart material-based bio-inspired aquatic locomotion by developing the first untethered piezoelectric swimmer as a platform to explore multiphysics fluid-electroelastic structure interactions. Another multiphysics research topic recently explored by his group is acoustic-electroelastic structure interaction for wireless power transfer using ultrasound waves. Erturk and collaborators have lately been conducting research at the intersection of metamaterials and smart structures. Recently they developed the first Gradient-Index Phononic Crystal Lens-based piezoelectric energy harvester. Low-frequency broadband vibration attenuation via locally-resonant finite elastic metamaterials is another research area explored by Erturk and collaborators.

Taxation bills to support the war against Spain at home and on the continent and to deal with chronic unrest in Ireland were approved.

At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, it won the award for Best World Album. The album's tracks span a number of musical styles, including tropicalia, a genre with which Gil is closely associated, as well as samba, funk, bossa nova, reggae, jazz, salsa, and pop. Background and style Quanta gente veio ver: Ao Vivo was recorded at the Teatro Jo√£o Caetano in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil during his 1997 world tour. It is connected in name and content to his 1997 studio- recorded album Quanta, which included a variety of tracks from different points in his career. Quanta Live is the name of the international release. Stylistically, Gil's well known association with the tropicalia genre is evident on the album, and its musical content has also been described as including samba, funk, bossa nova, reggae, jazz, salsa, and pop songs and styles. Most of the songs Gil plays with his seven-person supporting band were written by Gil. Two are covers of popular Bob Marley songs, \\"Is This Love\\" and \\"Stir It Up\\", one was written by Gordurinha, one by Alberto Ribeiro, and another co-written by Gil, Jo√£o Barone, Bi Ribeiro, and Herbert Vianna. Talking about the album in an interview with The Austin Chronicle, Gil said \\"What I really like to do is pick up the guitar and play, to write a song and sing it, to incorporate elements from all kinds of music. That's why I like Quanta Live. It's everything. It's jazz and samba and reggae and salsa. It's bossa nova and bai√£o. It's everything together. That's what I like.\\" Reception Quanta Live has received critical acclaim, and won the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. Interviewed the following year, Gil expressed that the award was particularly meaningful not only because Quanta was intended to represent a summary of the artist three decades into his career, but also because it was the live version rather than the studio album which won. Diane Gordon of JazzTimes said that through this performance \\"one can understand his immense international popularity\\" and praised the sound quality of the recording, calling it \\"as exciting as his material\\". AllMusics Richard S. Ginell's positive review commented that Gil is \\"still in possession of a quicksilver voice with a beautiful falsetto, a staccato guitar style that makes his electric model sound like an acoustic, and strikingly original, even quirky tunes\\".

It has hard, black \\"ironbark\\" on the trunk and all but the thinnest branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, buds usually arranged in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to hemispherical fruit. It is characterised by the blue-grey, powdery bloom on its leaves and flower buds. Description Eucalyptus atrata is a tree with hard black \\"ironbark\\" that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. Only the thinnest branches have smooth cream-coloured or brown bark. Its leaves and flower buds are covered with a bluish grey, powdery bloom. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broad lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves up to long and wide on a thick petiole up to long. Adult leaves have a similar appearance on both sides, lance-shaped, long, wide on a petiole up to long. The flower buds are usually arranged in group of seven in leaf axils or on the ends of the branches. The groups are on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual flowers on an angular pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long, wide with a hemispherical to cone-shaped operculum slightly shorter than the floral cup. Flowering mainly occurs from December to February and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long, wide on a pedicel long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus atrata was first formally described in 1991 by Lawrie Johnston and Ken Hill from a specimen collected by Donald Blaxell near Irvinebank. The specific epithet (atrata) is a Latin word meaning \\"dressed in black\\", referring to the dark bark. Distribution and habitat Herberton ironbark grows in grassy woodland or forest in scattered locations on and near the Atherton Tableland in Queensland, especially in the area bounded by Herberton, Irvinebank and Mareeba.

It was shown to overcome antiestrogen (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant) resistance in breast cancer by altering the shape of the estrogen receptor, thus exhibiting SERD properties.Antiestrogen GW5638 induces a unique structural change in the ER. The biological significance of this conformational change was revealed in studies that demonstrated that tamoxifen-resistant breast tumor explants are not cross-resistant to GW5638. Because of these properties, this drug is currently being developed as a potential therapeutic for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers. Etacstil is a tamoxifen derivative and one of the first drugs to overcome tamoxifen-resistance. It is the predecessor of GW-7604, of which etacstil is a prodrug (GW-7604 being the 4-hydroxy metabolite of etacstil). This is analogous to the case of tamoxifen being a prodrug of afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen). Etacstil was developed in the early 1990s by Duke University, Glaxo Wellcome, and later, Dupont. In 2001, Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMS) acquired Dupont, and for non-scientific, corporate reasons, closed the trial and abandoned the release of etacstil and its metabolite GW-7604. After many dormant years, a recent resurgence of interest in SERDs has led to the development of brilanestrant, a structural analogue of etacstil.

Biography  His father was a decorative painter who gave him his first lessons. After attending the Arts and Crafts school in Magdeburg, he was apprenticed to a lithographer. Before he had completed his training, the music publisher, Wilhelm von Heinrichshofen (1782-1881), a distant relative, helped him to enroll at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf and study with Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow. He was there from 1837 to 1841. Karl Ferdinand Sohn and Rudolf Wiegmann were also among his instructors. Stealing from the Grape Harvest Following graduation, he embarked on the \\"Grand Tour\\", beginning with Paris. While there, he took evening classes from Paul Delaroche and made copies at the Louvre. In 1842, he took part in an exhibition at the Salon. Following that, he visited Switzerland and Northern Italy, finally making his way to Rome, where he spent a year and a half, making sketches and studying the sculptures. He also worked as a portraitist, receiving orders from King Ludwwig I and Prince Henry of Prussia. After leaving Rome, he toured Spain and visited Morocco. While in Madrid, he became acquainted with Jos√© de Madrazo, Director of the Museo del Prado. He returned to Magdeburg by way of France in 1846, married his childhood sweetheart, and opened a studio which became a meeting place for artists, writers and theatrical performers. His works from this period are largely Spanish and Orientalist in theme. Later, he established himself as a portrait painter. His sitters included many local businessmen, clergy and politicians as well as King (later, Kaiser) Wilhelm I, although that portrait was lost and is now known only through a copper engraving. Tambourine Dance in the Mountains near M√°laga He was a member of numerous art societies and, in 1859, founded \\"Athene\\", an association for \\"art, science and humor\\". During the 1860s and 1870s, he travelled throughout and made lengthy stays in the mountains of Bavaria, Austria and Switzerland (notably the Harz Region), filling sketchbooks with drawings and watercolors. Two years after his wife's death in 1884, he succumbed to complications following a bout with pneumonia.

She was the founder and manager of Salmbergska flickpensionen ('Salmberg Pension for Girls'), one of the most famed and fashionable educational institutions for females in Finland in her time. Life Anna Salmberg was born in Denmark but was raised in Danish Caribbean, where English became her first language. She married the Finnish sea captain Arvid Abraham Salmberg (d. 1809), and moved with him to Finland. She had no children. When she was widowed, she supported herself as a teacher. In 1823, she founded and managed the Salmberg Pension for Girls in √Öbo. Since the foundation of the Christina Krook school in the 1780s, there had been a few private girls' schools in Finland, which remained the only secondary education available for females in Finland until the foundation of the Svenska fruntimmersskolan i √Öbo and Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors (1844). Of these schools, the Salmberg school in √Öbo, and the school of Baroness von Rosen in Helsinki, were described as the most notable. Anna Salmberg defended women's right to education. In her correspondence, she expressed the view, that although the women of Finland may be ignorant, it was the fault of their families, and particularly their fathers, for keeping them that way by not providing them with education and then calling them ignorant.Suomen kansallisbiografia (Finland's national biography) As was customary for schools of her kind, most of the education focused on accomplishments, such as drawing, embroidery and etiquette, but her school was recommended for a high level in the subjects, and her school offered more languages than were usual for a girls' school. In addition to French, she also tutored in the English language, at a time when that language was considered more important to learn for men and it was still otherwise unknown in girls' schools in Finland. Her most known students were the writer Fredrika Runeberg and the poet Augusta Lundahl, both of whom studied at her school in 1824‚Äì1825.

He was executed by the latter in 1034 for stirring a local Muslim uprising against Aleppo's vassalage to the Christian Byzantine Empire. Life Salim ibn al- Mustafad was the son of a ghulam (slave soldier; pl. ghilman) of Sayf al- Dawla, the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo in 945‚Äì967.Zakkar 1971, p. 258. Ibn al- Mustafad was a leader of the surviving Hamdanid-era ghilman when the Fatimids directly ruled Aleppo in the early 1020s.Amabe 2016, p. 62. Though of foreign origins, Ibn al-Mustafad was assimilated into the Aleppine populace and resided in the al-Zajjajin (glassmakers) quarter where he likely cultivated close relationships with craftsmen, minor traders and laborers.Amabe 2016, p. 66. Ibn al-Mustafad defected to the Bedouin rebel Salih ibn Mirdas when the latter besieged Aleppo in 1024. Ibn al-Mustafad rallied the ghilman and local residents and opened the Bab Qinnasrin gate to Salih's Kilabi forces on 18 January 1025. In turn, Salih guaranteed the residents' safety and appointed Ibn al-Mustafad as ra'is al-balad (municipal chief) and muqaddam al-ahdath (commander of the local militia). The ahdath consisted of young armed men from Aleppo's lower and middle-class neighborhoods. Salih then entrusted Ibn al- Mustafad and Sulayman ibn Tawq with overseeing the siege of the Aleppo Citadel where the Fatimid garrison was holed up. The latter surrendered on 30 June and all of Aleppo came under Salih's Mirdasid emirate.Amabe 2016, p. 63. After Salih died, his sons Nasr and Thimal succeeded him, until the former seized complete control of Aleppo in 1030 following the Mirdasid victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Azaz. Ibn al-Mustafad remained in charge of the ahdath, but he opposed Nasr's move to make the Emirate of Aleppo a formal vassal of the Byzantine Empire in 1031. He stirred up the city's poor and middle class Muslims to protest the alliance with Byzantium,Bianquis 1993, p. 117. prompting the Byzantine governor of Antioch to demand Nasr execute Ibn al-Mustafad. Accordingly, he was captured and executed in 1034. It is not apparent in contemporary sources if anyone succeeded Ibn al-Mustafad as commander of the ahdath.
