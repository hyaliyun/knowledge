They first began in 1972 and ceased in 2017 due to the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Diplomatic representation By January 1973, just two years after Qatar gained its independence, Egypt was among the eighteen countries that Qatar appointed an ambassador to. Political disputes The Qatari Embassy in Egypt's Mohandessin neighborhood Egypt boycotted the MEMA Conference in Qatar in 1997 after asserting that Qatar was financing Islamic militant organizations in Egypt. They also accused Qatar's media of harboring an anti-Egypt agenda. The conflict was mediated by Saudi Arabia later that year, but weeks after the intervention, Qatari authorities laid off 700 Egyptian workers in private and public sectors. During the conference, the Qatari foreign minister accused Egypt of supporting to the 'plotters', referring to the 110 individuals tried over the February 1996 counter-coup attempt against emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Qatar began denying entry visas to Egyptian citizens and reportedly harassed Egyptian laborers. = Relations after the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat = In July 2013, the Egyptian military ousted Qatari-supported president Mohamed Morsi. This severed tensions between Qatar and Egypt, with a number of Arab states backing Egypt in this dispute. Qatar was most chastised by the Arab states for its harboring of Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a Muslim cleric who is alleged to have had a prominent role within the intellectual leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood. In March 2014, three Arab states removed their ambassadors from Qatar in protest of the alleged interference by Qatar in other countries internal affairs, which included financially supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Around December 2014, Qatar moved to mend relations with Egypt amid pressure from other Persian Gulf countries, primarily Saudi Arabia. In February 2015, a month after the death of Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, another rift in relations emerged after Egypt conducted an airstrike over an ISIL bastion in Libya following the beheading of Egyptian Copts. The airstrikes were condemned by Al Jazeera, who broadcast images of civilian victims. Additionally, Qatar's foreign ministry expressed reservations over the airstrikes. This prompted Tariq Adel, Egypt's delegate to the Arab League, to accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism. Egyptian citizens also launched an online campaign denouncing Qatar. The GCC rejected Egypt's accusations and its secretary general regarded the statements to be false. Shortly after, Qatar recalled its ambassador to Egypt for consultations. = 2017 diplomatic crisis = On 5 June 2017, The Egyptian government, along with those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, announced to cut diplomatic relations with Qatar. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry announced it was closing its operations to Qatari transportation. The Egyptian, Saudi, Bahraini, and Emirati governments cited Qatar's continuing support for \\"terrorism\\", such as the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is banned by the government and considered a terrorist organization. Islam Hassan argues \\"Egypt has had troubled relations with Qatar for many years, except during the presidential period of Mohamed Morsi. The Egyptian government has seen Qatar as a source of instability. The Egyptian regime also sees that Qatar challenges its rule by financing the Muslim Brotherhood, and other organizations, which the regime has outlawed and consider terrorist organizations. Thus, the Egyptian regime has been trying to resist Qatar by any means. The current issue between the Saudi's and Qatar seemed to be an opportunity to put pressure on Qatar to stop financing the Muslim Brotherhood, its affiliates, and supporters, and to support the Sisi regime.\\" Al Jazeera In the early years after Al Jazeera's formation in 1996, it was often involved in the criticism of Hosni Mubarak, which prompted retaliation by Mubarak and the Egyptian media. In 1997, Egypt sent the head of its intelligence agency, Omar Suleiman, to respond to the news network's criticism of the Egyptian government. In an interview in 2002, Mubarak blamed Al Jazeera for \\"spreading friction, enmity and instability among Arab countries\\". A US diplomatic cable leaked from 2010 revealed that Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani told US senator John Kerry that he made an offer to Mubarak in which he would 'stop Al Jazeera for a year' if Egypt agreed to deliver a lasting settlement to the Palestinians during that period. After the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi replaced Muslim Brotherhood affiliated Mohamed Morsi as president of Egypt. Sisi initiated a crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood's media allies, which included Al Jazeera, who provided several prominent Muslim Brotherhood spokesmen with media platforms. This culminated in the arrests of Al Jazeera journalists Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Ghorab in December 2013. Al Jazeera broadcasts were banned in Egypt in September 2013 following accusations that the network was disrupting the internal affairs of the country. Economic relations From January 2003 to June 2014, Egypt accounted for the largest share of all financial investments made by Qatari firms at 31.1 percent. During the one-year reign of Mohamed Morsi, Qatar assisted Egypt by sending it $7.5 bn in grants and loans. Following Morsi's ouster from power in July 2013, Egypt in September 2013 returned $2 bn that Qatar deposited in its central bank. Between September and November 2014, Egypt paid back $2.5 bn in debts. The last $1 bn of Egypt's debts to Qatar were paid out in July 2016.

LFKL students follow a French curriculum leading to the French Baccalaureate with a European section. They benefit from a high standard education that includes cultural, artistic, technical, scientific, literary and sports activities. Classes are provided by qualified French teachers attached to the Ministry of National Education and by professional English native-speaking teachers. The LFKL offers an early English program for kindergarten students through educational activities, by taking into account the diversity of their language levels. In secondary school, in addition to English, students have the opportunity to learn 4 languages (German, Spanish, Mandarin and Bahasa Melayu) and receive international certifications every year (Cambridge, DELF, DELE, IELTS). Most of our students become bilingual or trilingual at the end of their studies.  History  1962: The school first opened for only a few students and was generously hosted by the Alliance Fran√ßaise. 1974: The establishment received the regulatory approvals from the Ministry of French National Education. The French school had a small campus about twenty students from the 1st year of Primary school to 1st year of Secondary school. 1983: The number of students reached 42, the school moved to the expatriate district of Bukit Tunku. 1990: LFKL became a non-profit association and signed a convention with the Agency of French Schools Abroad (AEFE). The school also obtained a regulatory approval for secondary classes (1996) and high school classes (1997). 2003: The school offered a curriculum from kindergarten to highschool, it was necessary for the LFKL to move again and start building a bigger establishment. 2004: The 1st stone of the new French School was laid in Segambut (at the current establishment). The inauguration of the new infrastructure took place in September 2005 to accommodate 339 students. 2020: Today, the LFKL gathers 120 employees, guaranteeing a high standard curriculum in accordance with the French conventions, regulatory approvals and programs. The establishment brings together more than 380 families including 730 students in an international environment.

Left to right: Gianluca Galetti, Emyr Tomos, Marcel Stoetzler, Matthew Karas Glassglue are a British experimental pop group, formed in London in 2003, by German singer, Marcel Stoetzler, and British multi-instrumentalist, Matthew Karas. After writing and arranging some material and performing as a duo, they recruited Andrea Ughetto to play bass and Ravi Low-Beer to play drums. Andrea, who was involved as a favour to Marcel, was replaced by Gianluca Galetti in 2004. Ravi Low-Beer was replaced by Emyr Tomos in 2005, but returned to the group in 2009. Primarily, Glassglue are a live act, who have made few recordings, believing that their music was hard to capture on record. When they were founded, all the members lived in or near Hackney, and many of their early performances were there, and they were included in the Hackney Bohemian Library. However, they are now well-known on the underground alt-rock and punk circuits in London, including Anti-folk events. They have also attracted the attention of the art scene, having been chosen to play at the Tate Britain for a \\"Late at the Tate\\" event in August 2008, and having done several live sessions on Arts Council funded radio station Resonance FM. They were also included in the Subscuta Arts Festival in Portugal in June 2006. They have been involved in significant events of more established acts in underground music, notably at the re-release event of \\"Kip of the Serenes\\", the Joe Boyd produced debut album of Irish psychedelic group Dr. Strangely Strange and a benefit for \\"Climate of Change\\" with Tymon Dogg. Their music does not espouse politics, but they have performed several shows in squatted venues, and at benefit shows for the RampART Social Centre in Whitechapel. In 2010 they recorded their debut album, Fantods, at Faust Studios in Germany, with original Faust keyboard player, Hans-Joachim Irmler, as producer and Andreas Schmid, bass player in The Nightingales as engineer. The album was released by Klangbad Records in 2013, and chosen as one of the five best releases of 2013 by Mudkiss. Gianluca Galetti left the group in 2016, upon moving to Barcelona, though returned to London for recording sessions, in order to complete the group's second album, which is still in production by Hans-Joachim Irmler, as of August 2017. Simon Marsh joined the group on bass in early 2019. Matthew Karas also plays bass guitar and harmonica with The Fallen Leaves, and was a founding member of Soil.

He attended the University of Louisville and earned a Bachelor of Science degree, and also attended Law School there. He is a real estate agent. Hines married Teresa Churchill and had four children. In 1986, Hines lead the movement to change the wording of the Kentucky State Song, My Old Kentucky Home. In that year, a Japanese youth group visiting the Kentucky General Assembly sang the song to the legislators, using the original lyrics that included the word \\"darkies\\". Hines was offended by this and subsequently introduced a resolution that would substitute the word \\"people\\" in place of \\"darkies\\" whenever the song was used by the House of Representatives. A similar resolution was introduced by Georgia Davis Powers in the Kentucky State Senate. The resolution was adopted by both chambers.

The course design made excellent use of Bonnie Briar's hilly and low wetland areas, surrounding a wooded interior. A.H.

The land had belonged to the Lyman Bill estate. Colonel E. Lyman Bill, a successful publisher and one of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, had owned a large piece of property along the Mamaroneck and New Rochelle border, on which he had a private club with tennis courts and a rudimentary golf course. The first and ninth fairways became the site of the first golf layout in the United States. The Colonel wanted to build a palatial residence on his estate, yet died before its completion. The Bonnie Briar Country Club was then organized in 1921 with the financial assistance of the Bill family. The first president was the Colonel's son, Edward Lyman Bill, who finished construction of the clubhouse.Mamaroneck Town: A History of \\"The Gathering Place\\", Paula B.

He was defeated by Rafael Carrera on 19 March 1840, the same date on which the Los Altos State ceased to exist. Trying to create Los Altos once again while Carrera was briefly in exile in 1848, he tried to occupy Guatemala City along with rebel leader Agust√≠n Reyes, and after setting fire to Carrera's house, he was killed by enemy fire in the Plaza de Armas.  Biography  Agust√≠n Guzm√°n arrived in Guatemala as part of Vicente Fil√≠sola's army in 1822, when Central America was annexed to the Mexican Empire of Agust√≠n de Iturbide; after Fil√≠sola and his forces left, he decided to remain in Guatemala and settled in Quetzaltenango. In 1837 the revolts started against the Federal President Francisco Moraz√°n; the Central American Federation then comprised Guatemala, Comayagua, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The leader of the peasant revolt against the Guatemalan governor Mariano G√°lvez was Rafael Carrera. In early 1838, Jos√© Francisco Barrundia, a Guatemalan liberal leader, was appalled at the atrocities that Galvez regime was doing to stop the peasant revolt and decided to negotiate with Carrera to overthrow G√°lvez by bringing the revolution leader to the capital city of Guatemala. At that time, Carrera already was showing signs of the leadership and military genius that would be his characteristics later on. Coat of arms of Los Altos, carved in stone on the grave of heroes in the Cemetery of Quetzaltenango Mariano Rivera Paz, Conservative Chief of State of Guatemala during the time Los Altos was recovered for Guatemala by Rafael Carrera On April 2, 1838, in the city of Quetzaltenango, a secessionist group founded the independent State of Los Altos which sought independence from Guatemala. The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative regime moved to Los Altos, who no longer had to emigrate to El Salvador, having a pro-liberal state practically in his country agglutinated Interim Governor Valenzuela, in office after G√°lvez had excused himself, could not do anything to stop this and the Central American Federation approved the sixth state on 5 June 1838 with a provisional junta formed by Marcelo Molina Matta, Jos√© M. G√°lvez and Jos√© Antonio Aguilar, with Agust√≠n Guzm√°n as Army commander in chief. In December 1838, Molina Matta was formally elected as Governor of Los Altos and set to work immediately on developing the roads and infrastructure of a port on the Pacific Ocean and to improve his relationship with the federal government in El Salvador. The natives of the region, on the other hand, went to Guatemala City to complain about the liberal criollos that were running the state, specially Totonicap√°n Mayor Macario Rodas, and Agust√≠n Guzm√°n, who had set extraordinary taxes, had kept the native personal tax that G√°lvez had established and Guatemala had eliminated after he was deposed, and had confiscated unilaterally most of the Indian common territories. When Guzman and the rest of Los Altos leaders learned about the complains, they incarcerated the natives who had gone to Guatemala City. = 1839 coup de' etat = Guatemala in 1839. Guatemalan General Rafael Carrera On 14 April 1838, the conservatives lost power in Guatemala and Carrera was sent as captain of a small force in Mita without any kind of weapon. Their defeat started when Francisco Moraz√°n and Jos√© Francisco Barrundia, invaded Guatemala and arrived to San Sur, where they executed Pascual Alvarez, Carrera father- in-law, and then placed his head on top of a stick to scare and terrorize Carrera followers. Upon learning this, Carrera and his amazon wife Petrona, who had left Guatemala city to confront Moraz√°n and were in Mataquescuintla, swore that they would make Moraz√°n pay for this even in death. Moraz√°n sent several couriers, but Carrera did not receive any of them, particularly Barrundia who was told that Carrera did not want to see him so we would not kill Barrundia. Moraz√°n then started a terror campaign in the area, destroying all towns on his path and stealing everything he could, thus forcing Carrera forces to hide in the mountains. The liberals in Los Altos began a harsh criticism of the Conservative government of Rivera Paz; even had their own newspaper ‚Äì El Popular, which contributed to the harsh criticism. Moreover, Los Altos was the region with more production and economic activity of the former State of Guatemala; without Los Altos, conservatives lost many merits that held the hegemony of the State of Guatemala in Central America. Then, the government of Guatemala tried to reach to a peaceful solution, but \\"altenses\\",Altenses is how people from Quetzaltenango are known in Guatemala. protected by the recognition of the Central American Federation Congress, did not accept this; Guatemala's government then resorted to force, sending the commanding general of the Army Rafael Carrera to subdue Los Altos. Carrera defeated General Agustin Guzman when the former Mexican officer tried to ambush him and then went on to Quetzaltenango, where he imposed a harsh and hostile conservative regime for liberals. Calling all council members, he told them flatly that he was behaving kindly to them for being that the first time they had challenged him, but sternly warned them that there would be no mercy if there were to be a second time. Finally, General Guzm√°n, and the head of state of Los Altos, Marcelo Molina, were sent to the capital of Guatemala, where they were displayed as trophies of war during a triumphant parade on February 17, 1840; in the case of Guzman, he was shackled, still with bleeding wounds, and riding a mule. = Carrera exile and Los Altos = Proclamation Coin 1847 of the independent Republic of Guatemala During his first term as president, Rafael Carrera had brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a traditional climate; however, in 1848, the liberals were able to force Rafael Carrera to leave office, after the country had been in turmoil for several months. Carrera resigned at his own free will and left for M√©xico. The new liberal regime allied itself with the Aycinena family and swiftly passed a law where they emphatically ordered to execute Carrera if he dared to return to Guatemalan soil. On his absence, the liberal criollos from Quetzaltenango ‚Äì led by general Agust√≠n Guzm√°n, who occupied the city after Corregidor General Mariano Paredes was called to Guatemala City to take over the presidential office‚Äì declared that Los Altos was an independent state once again on 26 August 1848; the new state had the support of Vasconcelos' regime in El Salvador and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz who were declared enemies of general Carrera. The interim government was led by Guzm√°n himself and had Florencio Molina and priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members. On 5 September 1848, the criollos altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Mart√≠nez. In the meantime, Carrera decided to return to Guatemala and did so entering by Huehuetenango, where he met with the native leaders and told them that they had to remain united to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started developing a new Indian identity under Carrera's leadership. In the meantime, on the eastern part of Guatemala, the Jalapa region became increasingly dangerous; former president Mariano Rivera Paz and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849. Upon learning that officer Jos√© V√≠ctor Zavala had been appointed as corregidor in Suchitep√©quez, Carrera and his hundred jacalteco bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with jaguars to meet his former friend. When they met, Zavala not only did not capture him, but agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City, that realized that they were forced to negotiate with Carrera, otherwise they were going to have to battle on two fronts: Quetzaltenango and Jalapa. Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitep√©quez as a tactical maneuver. Carrera received a visit from a Cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he will keep them appeased. When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable. Agust√≠n Guzm√°n went to Antigua Guatemala to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzm√°n defeat his hated enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean. Guzm√°n was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when, in his absence, Carrera and his native allies had occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as corregidor and convinced him that he should work with the k'iche', mam, q'anjobal and mam leaders to keep the region under control. On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: Now he is the King of the Indians, indeed! Guzm√°n then left for Jalapa, where he stroke a deal with the rebels, while Luis Batres Juarros convinced president Paredes to deal with Carrera; Guzm√°n could only get a temporary truce from the revolt leaders Le√≥n Raymundo, Roberto Reyes and Agust√≠n P√©rez; however, the truce was short lived, as the rebels sacked Jalapa on June 3 and 4. Guzman then left for El Salvador, where after a while he issued a note to the rest of liberal leaders in Central America in which he attacked the immorality and viciousness of the savage Rafael Carrera, who -according to Guzman- had not governed Guatemala properly in the last nine years. In his note, Guzman told that he had gone to El Salvador to retire from public life, but that he could not remain impassible watching how Guatemala was returning to Carrera's rule and saying that with the help of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and the reborn Los Altos he was going to confront Carrera and return to a federal government; he practically assured that he was Moraz√°n's successor trying to get rid of Carrera, but his note did not gather any support and Carrera returned to power in Guatemala.  Death  Guzm√°n entered Guatemalan territory one last time with his new ally, Agust√≠n Reyes. They were chased by Carrera and his forces on the eastern part of the country, but played their strategy well and were able to go directly to Guatemala City, leaving the Guatemalan Army still looking for them in the East. Guatemala City had a small garrison of 100 men, in charge of colonel Ignacio Garcia Granados, who learned about the rebel attack when two spies arrived telling him that the enemy was already in Chinautla, only 3 leagues away from the city. Guzm√≥n and Reyes entered the city after defeating Garcia Granados in El Cerro del Carmen and went directly to Carrera's house where Guzm√°n threw torches knowing that Carrera's family was inside;Petrona and her children were able to escape unharmed and were taken in by the archbishop. after that, they went to the Government Palace in Plaza de Armas, but there they were attacked by heavy artillery and Guzm√°n was badly injured. He died that night, at the outskirt of Guatemala city while his forces were fleeing.

Early life Robinson was born on October 6, 1844 in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts to John Robinson, a shoemaker and singing teacher, and his wife Sarah Lufkin (Ingersoll) Robinson. In 1851 the family moved to Alton, Illinois. After he graduated from Alton High School, Robinson taught in the Alton public school system. He enlisted in the Union Army on May 12, 1864 for a term of 100 days and was assigned to the 133rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a private. He reenlisted on September 24, 1864 and was appointed as first lieutenant. However, a severe illness prevented him from being mustered back into the service. After he recovered, Robinson spent the remainder of the war as a clerk in the Provost Marshal's office in Alton. After the war, Robinson was involved in various business pursuits in Alton. Business career In 1868, Robinson moved to Gloucester, Massachusetts. On January 21, 1869 he married Helen Amanda Smith. Soon afterward he was hired as a bookkeeper by Stockbridge & Smith. He later became a partner in the business, which became known as Stockbridge & Co. In 1876 Stockbridge & Co. consolidated with the Gloucester Fresh Fish Company and Stenson & Company to form the Atlantic Halibut Company. Robinson was Atlantic Halibut's treasurer and secretary. In 1895, Atlantic Halibut consolidated with some smaller firms to form the American Halibut Company. Robinson was the new company's treasurer. In addition to his work with Atlantic/American Halibut, Robinson served as a president of the Gloucester Fisherman's Institute for five years and was a director of the City National Bank of Gloucester. Fraternal organizations and groups Robinson was involved with a number of fraternal organizations. He was twice elected Supreme Templar of the Templars of Honor and Temperance. He was also elected Grand Commander of Massachusetts of the Knights of Malta and in 1890 was a representative to the Imperial Body of the Knights of Malta in Glasgow. From 1902 to 1912, Robinson was president of the Robinson Genealogical Society. He was also a member of the Sons of Temperance, Grand Army of the Republic, and the Freemasons. Political career In 1879, Robinson was elected to the Gloucester Common Council. In 1881 he was elected Council President. He ran for Mayor in 1881, but lost to William Williams 1,011 votes to 863. He ran again in 1883. In a four way race, Robinson received 635 votes, which put him behind incumbent William H. Wonson III (873 votes), but ahead of fellow challengers Daniel D. Saunders (454) and William Williams (282). =Mayor of Gloucester= Robinson ran for a third time in 1886. This time he was successful, winning by 142 votes. He ran for reelection in 1887, and received 1,203 votes to Daniel D. Saunders' 1,197 and John S. Parsons' 203. Due to the close result, a recount was held, which determined that Robinson had beaten Saunders by four votes (1,200 to 1,196). Although Gloucester elected a Temperance mayor, it also voted to allow liquor licenses. The Board of Aldermen approved three licenses, but Robinson refused to sign them. George A. Davis, a bottler of malt liquor whose license Robinson refused to sign, applied to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for a writ of mandamus compelling Robinson to sign his license. The Court sided with Davis and issued a writ ordering him to sign the license. Robinson still refused to sign and on May 24, 1888 he presented his resignation to the Board of Aldermen. Robinson returned to the office of Mayor by defeating incumbent Benjamin F. Cook in 1895. Cook then defeated Robinson the following year. During his tenure as Mayor, Gloucester erected a number of new buildings, including a new high school, armory, police station and courthouse, and paved a large amount of its streets. The city's financial condition also improved, as its debt was bonded at a reduced rate of interest. =Massachusetts Governor's Council= From 1902 to 1904, Robinson was a member of the Massachusetts Governor's Council. He was a member of the Council's committees on Harbors and Public Lands, Charitable Institutions, Prisons, Military and Naval Affairs, and Warrants as well as the committee that organized the dedication ceremony for the Dorchester Heights Monument. =Essex County Treasurer= In 1903, Robinson was elected Essex County Treasurer. He held this position until his death on November 13, 1921. During his final year in office, Robinson had come under fire for depositing $233,679 of county funds with the Tremont Trust Company of Boston, not only because Tremont had been closed by Massachusetts Bank Commissioner Joseph Allen, but because Robinson had promised to deposit all of Essex County's money in banks located in the county.

History  The first locationized gun was invented by John Martin in 1984. Although locationized guns could prevent much crime and accompanying deaths and injuries, they have not been commercially developed. An important reason for that is because legislated restrictions would be required for conventional guns, and those restrictions would be difficult to pass in some markets.  Operating principles, advantages, and technologies  The main advantage of locationized guns is that they can satisfy the right to possess arms for defense of homes and businesses while being useless for many crimes that can be committed away from those homes and businesses. Other advantages of locationized guns depend on them having electronic circuitry and electronic control over firing. Those technologies make it relatively easy to design them to communicate with a cellular or other communication system to provide information or to be externally prevented from firing regardless of location. Using GPS asset tracking technology can allow a locationized gun to transmit a message through a cellular network to its owner if the gun is removed from its normal location. GPS tracking could then allow its location to be known by its owner and/or law enforcement to assist in recovery of the gun. Communications can allow police agencies to learn that a locationized gun is or was at a location of interest, thereby facilitating crime solving or allowing precautions to be taken before arriving at the location. Police agencies can also be automatically notified with information about when and where a locationized gun has been fired. Most importantly, police agencies would be able to prevent firing of the gun in the case of its theft, a police raid, shootout, threatened suicide, restraining order, etc. = Limited firing time: Early technology = A locationized gun of this type cannot be fired unless it has remained motionless for a relatively long time, e. g. 24 hours. Following that time period, there is only a relatively short time period that it can be fired after being picked up for use, e. g. 5 minutes.US Patent 5192818, John M. Martin, \\"Means for reducing the criminal usefulness of hand weapons\\", issued 1993-3-9 After its firing time period expires, it must undergo its motionless period again to allow firing. Consequently, the usefulness of this gun is restricted to locations relatively close to where it is kept, e.g. its owner's property. A demonstration model having timing and movement sensing circuitry was produced in 1989.R. A. Lesmeister \\"A Cordless .38\\" American Firearms Industry, April 1989 p. 24, 25. = Restricted area of enabling signal reception: Later technologies = This type of locationized gun cannot be fired unless it is located within the range of a signal that enables firing of the gun.US Patent 5068989, John M.

Cable length or reception distance determines the area where firing is possible. A temporarily fixed transmitting location can be a portable base station that must remain motionless for a relatively long time period, e. g. 24 hours, before its signal transmitting begins.Barry Gross.

It marks Chad L. Coleman's final appearance as series regular Tyreese. It also features several appearances from deceased characters in Tyreese's hallucinations. The episode was written by series showrunner Scott M. Gimple and directed by Greg Nicotero. The narrative takes place in Richmond, Virginia, marking the first time the series is not set in Georgia. It takes place 17 days after Beth Greene's (Emily Kinney) death as the group finds Noah's walled community known as \\"Shirewilt Estates\\", a nod to a similar location in the comic book series. The episode primarily focuses on Tyreese, his struggle accepting death, and the guilt he faces over the losses of other group members due to actions he believes he could have done differently. The opening montage intercuts among a funeral that appears to be Beth's and previous sanctuaries: Woodbury, the prison, and Shirewilt. The ending reveals the funeral is Tyreese's. Several deceased characters return as hallucinations such as Martin (Chris Coy), Bob Stookey (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.), The Governor (David Morrissey), Lizzie and Mika Samuels (Brighton Sharbino and Kyla Kenedy), and Beth Greene. This episode also includes an acoustic cover version of Jimmy Cliff's \\"Struggling Man\\" sung by Beth. The episode was lauded by television commentators, who praised Coleman's performance, Nicotero's direction, and Gimple's script. Others noted Tyreese's death as shocking and well-handled. Plot The group is still reeling from the tragedy of Beth Greene (Emily Kinney)'s death at Grady Memorial Hospital. They decide that the best way to honor her is to complete Beth's intended mission of reuniting Noah (Tyler James Williams) with his family. The entire group makes the 530-mile journey to \\"Shirewilt Estates\\", a walled community outside Richmond, Virginia, leaving Georgia behind. Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), Michonne (Danai Gurira), Tyreese Williams (Chad L. Coleman), Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun), and Noah decide to scout ahead and visit the compound first, while the others remain behind to be safe. In the car, Tyreese tells Noah and the others about his father who always used to tell him and Sasha Williams (Sonequa Martin-Green) that, as citizens of the world, they should listen to the news and never change the channel or turn it off, as they should always know about the atrocities that take place so they can be prepared and have their eyes open. Upon arrival, however, they discover the community has been overrun and everybody inside it killed. The words, \\"Wolves not far\\", are spray painted on a brick wall. Noah breaks down, and Tyreese stays behind to comfort him as Rick, Michonne, and Glenn scout for supplies. Tyreese tells Noah that he wanted to give in and die when Karen (Melissa Ponzio) was killed, but that he kept on fighting, and decided to live and, as a result, he was able to protect Judith when she needed him. Noah stands and sprints to his family's home, with Tyreese in pursuit. They arrive and find Noah's family dead. Tyreese explores the house while Noah sits by his mother's corpse and apologizes for not returning home sooner. While focused on pictures of Noah's family, Tyreese is bitten by Noah's reanimated brother, whom Noah quickly dispatches with a model jet. Noah leaves immediately to retrieve Rick and the others. Tyreese suffers severe blood loss and begins to hallucinate about news stories on the radio as well as visits by Martin (Chris Coy), Bob Stookey (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.), The Governor (David Morrissey), Lizzie and Mika Samuels (Brighton Sharbino and Kyla Kenedy), and Beth Greene (Emily Kinney), who discuss his actions throughout his time with the group. Over the radio, Tyreese begins to hear a news story about a group of people traveling up the East Coast and slaughtering innocent people in gruesome ways. He also struggles internally with his recent decisions and \\"speaks\\" with his hallucinations. Bob, Beth, and the girls try to comfort and reassure him that he did the right thing, and that death is much better than being alive, but The Governor and Martin antagonize him for not being able to do what they feel needed to be done. In between his discussions Tyreese is bitten again in a skirmish with another walker, further worsening his already bleak situation. Elsewhere, Michonne continues to express a desire to settle in one place and to fortify the town, but Rick argues that the town is indefensible, showing how part of its defensive wall had apparently been toppled by a large vehicle. They notice walkers that have been severed in half, but do not act upon it any further. Michonne then recommends going to Washington, D.C., because, although Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt) lied about a cure, D.C. may still have resources to improve their chances for survival. Rick comes around and agrees to make the 100 mile journey to Washington, which pleases Michonne. They are then alerted by Noah screaming. They find him about to be bitten by walkers, but manage to save him in time. Noah informs the others about Tyreese's condition. Tyreese is being further antagonized by The Governor while Lizzie holds his hand, though in reality this is Rick stretching his arm so Michonne can amputate it, and they suffer a grueling challenge in escaping the estate with a seriously wounded Tyreese. They fight their way through waves of walkers and pass a truck filled with walkers that have had their arms and legs cut off and the letter W carved into their foreheads. During the ride back, Tyreese is comforted by visions of Bob, Beth, and the girls. He tells Bob to turn off the radio, effectively deciding that he wants to let go and join them in death. He passes away and is put down by Michonne, so that he does not reanimate. The remaining survivors then attend his funeral, which Father Gabriel Stokes (Seth Gilliam) presides over. A visibly traumatized Sasha is seen struggling to stand throughout the service while Rick personally buries him and leaves his cap on his cross. Production \\"What Happened and What's Going On\\" was written by executive producer and showrunner Gimple and directed by executive producer and special make-up effects supervisor Nicotero. The episode features several guest appearances by actors whose characters were killed off in previous episodes, including Kinney as Beth, Gilliard Jr. as Bob, Morrissey as The Governor, Sharbino as Lizzie, Kenedy as Mika, and Coy as Martin. Lincoln, in his natural accent, provided the voice of the radio broadcaster. This episode marks Chad L. Coleman's final appearance as a series regular, as Tyreese was killed off in the episode. On the decision to kill Tyreese, Gimple explained: \\"There is never a right time; this was the time the story seemed to dictate. Not just for this episode but for the story moving forward. The cumulative effect of the last eight episodes and then this ninth episode, moving into next few, it's all a cumulative effect of who these people are and the circumstances they eventually find themselves in. It's weird to say, \\"This was the time\\" because it's such a painful thing. It just seemed to be what the story dictated.\\" The episode features a homage to the comic book series as Noah's community of 20 people is known as \\"Shirewilt Estates\\". The name comes from the prominent location, \\"Wiltshire Estates\\" in \\"Miles Behind Us\\". Reception This episode marks the death of Tyreese, portrayed by Chad L. Coleman, whose performance was applauded by critics. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 15.64 million American viewers with an 18-49 rating of 8.0, an increase in viewership from the previous episode which had 14.81 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 7.6. In Australia, it received 79,000 viewers, making it the most-watched broadcast on pay television that night. The British broadcast was the most-watched on the network that month, with 1.16 million viewers. =Critical reception= The episode received critical acclaim, with many praising the direction of Nicotero, the script of Gimple and the performance by Coleman. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 100% with an average rating of 8.08 out of 10, based on 27 reviews. The critics' consensus reads: A visually impressive episode of The Walking Dead, \\"What Happened and What's Going On\\" artfully portrays the psychology of the characters, rather than focusing on its shocking moments. Writing for Forbes, Erik Kain considered it to be the \\"best episode in years\\". He said, \\"It‚Äôs all of this attention to detail, whether just a terrific shot of the train tracks or a moment of explosive gore, that make this such a remarkable and memorable episode‚Äîan impressive cinematic achievement, and a tremendous hour of television.\\" IGN's Matt Fowler praised the episode's opening montage, which was revealed as foreshadowing to the end of the episode in a plot twist that the funeral taking place was Tyreese's and not Beth's, calling it a \\"great little trick\\". He praised the performance of Coleman, and the direction of Nicotero declaring it \\"gorgeously directed\\", the theme of hopelessness within the episode and the hallucinations of the deceased characters. Overall, he gave the episode a 9.0/10.

Description Thelymitra antennifera is a tuberous, perennial herb, 10‚Äì25 cm tall with yellow flowers from July to October. Its leaf is circular in cross-section, 5 to 12 cm long and 2 to 3 mm wide. The inflorescence consists of one to four yellow flowers on a wiry, zig-zagged often pinkish stem. Each flower is 20 to 40 mm across with a lemon or vanilla scent. The sepals and petals are 12 to 20 mm long and 4 to 6 mm wide, the sepals having a broad, reddish-brown band on their outer surface. The column is 5 to 6 mm long and 2 to 3 mm wide with dark brown arms that are ear-like and held high above the column. As with others in the genus, it reproduces by seeds but is unusual in that it is one of the few that develops tubers on the end of stolon-like roots, allowing it to form new colonies. The flowers are insect pollinated and open readily, even on cool days and are long-lasting. Distribution and habitat The species occurs in the South-West and Eremaean botanical provinces of Western Australia. It is also found South Australia and Victoria. In Tasmania it only occurs in a few small areas and is classified as an endangered species in that state. Elsewhere it is widespread and common, growing in many habitats, especially shrub, heath and mallee. It sometimes forms dense, extensive colonies, flowering freely, especially after fire. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described by John Lindley in 1840 in his A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony (1840) as Macdonaldia antennifera. but was later renamed Thelymitra antennifera by the English botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in The botany of the Antarctic voyage of H.M. discovery ships Erebus and Terror. III. Flora Tasmaniae The specific epithet (antennifera) is from the Latin antenna, (classically \\"a sail yard\\"), and -fer meaning \\"-bearing\\", referring to the lateral appendages on the column. The genus name Macdonaldia, honours \\"Mrs. Smith, n√©e Macdonald, a lady who has examined the Orchidaceous plants of that island with great care, and from whom a most beautiful series of dried specimens has reached me through the offices of Mr. Gunn\\".

Described in 2014, A. hoosieri was the first new species of amblyopsid cavefish to be discovered in 40 years. Etymology The specific name is derived from the word \\"Hoosier\\", the name for a resident of the state of Indiana. The choice of the name was also influenced by the fact that Prosanta Chakrabarty, the senior author of the paper that first described the species, was a fan of the Indiana Hoosiers college basketball team. Discovery During a 2013 study of Amblyopsis spelaea, scientists found that the species was divided into two distinct evolutionary lineages: one north of the Ohio River, in Indiana, and one south of the river, in Kentucky. The northern population was described as a new species in a 2014 paper published in the journal ZooKeys, making it the first new species of amblyopsid cavefish to have been discovered in the U.S. in 40 years. Description Average length is . The head makes up approximately one quarter of its total length. As typical of cavefish, this species is blind. The lower jaw extends beyond the upper. The body is flattened dorsally, but robust, with short, rounded fins. The anus is located toward the front of the body, directly behind the gills. General coloration is pinkish-white, with red around the gills. The fins are transparent. Reproduction and development Breeding takes place between February and April, when the water levels are highest. Eggs are brooded in the females' gill cavity. After hatching, the females care for the young for 4-5 months. Individuals become sexually mature at 3-4 years of age. The species is suspected to have a lifespan of 12-15 years, but may live as long as 20 years. Diet The species feeds on amphipods, copepods, isopods, and crayfish. It is believed to be the apex predator in its environment. Range and habitat The subterranean A. hoosieri is distributed among 68 caves and 6 springs throughout Indiana, between the Ohio River and the East Fork of the White River. Its range is limited to those caves that were not covered by glaciers during the Pleistocene. The Hoosier cavefish is usually found in pools in slow-flowing cave streams, in water that ranges from more than deep to as shallow as . Other species from the genus have been observed to prefer large, deep pools. Conservation status The species is threatened by a number of factors: sedimentation from agriculture, human encroachment on its habitat, and groundwater pollution by herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizer. The species may also have been affected by over-collection of samples for scientific study during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Due to these factors, the authors recommended that the species be classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Hoosier cavefish is known to occur in the protected Spring Mill State Park. The state of Indiana also has policies in place to protect species of Amblyopsis.

Tissot moved to England in the year 1871, when he was thirty five years old and settled there. Before moving to London, Tissot was a successful painter of Paris society. It is 300 x 391 inches in size. The painting shows a group of elegantly dressed men and women during a picnic at the pond in the painter's garden. The painting is characterized by the attention to detail and vivid colours. Holyday is held in London's Tate Gallery.  Description Holyday was painted in the back garden of Tissot's London home, near the Lord's Cricket Ground. Autumn is coming, the leaves of the large chestnut tree are changing color, but the rest of the vegetation is still green and luxurious. The low sun shines a bright afternoon light on the scene. On the right is the painter's muse and lover, Kathleen Newton, who appears to avert her eyes from the scene. The men in the painting belong to the well-known I Zingari cricket club, judging by their yellow, red and black hats. The women are overdressed, one of Tissot's idiosyncrasies. The atmosphere is sensual and relaxed and demonstrates a British sense of superiority. La Partie carr√©e, 1876. Stylistically, Holyday is striking because of its crystal-clear representation. The work is hyperrealistic and greatly detailed, with sparkling colors. The focus on daily scenes comes from Impressionism, which was en vogue in the Paris of those days. The influence of Manet can be recognized, also in the choice of subject, reminiscent of his Le d√©jeuner sur l'herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass). However, Holyday does not provoke but is suffused with a British conservatism.  History Tissot's Holyday was shown in 1877 in London's Grosvenor Gallery as a pendant for A Convalescent, which was also painted by Tissot in his yard. He made studies for both paintings in a single sketchbook. He probably intended the two to be a diptych, though they were quickly separated when sold and never exhibited together afterward. A Convalescent is in the Manchester Art Gallery; Holyday was acquired by the Tate Gallery in 1928. References * A. Butler: Het kunstboek. Waanders, Zwolle, 2004.

This word inclusively means \\"demons; monsters; specters; goblins; ghosts; devils\\" in Modern Standard Chinese, but wangliang originally meant a specific demon. Interpretations include a wilderness spirit like the kui Â§î \\"one-legged mountain demon\\", a water spirit like the long Èæç \\"dragon\\", a fever demon like the yu È≠ä \\"poisonous 3-legged turtle that causes malaria\\", a graveyard ghost also called wangxiang ÁΩîË±° or fangliang ÊñπËâØ \\"earth demon that eats the livers or brains of corpses\\", and a man-eating \\"demon that resembles a 3-year-old brown child with red eyes, long ears, and beautiful hair\\". Name In modern Chinese usage, wangliang \\"demon; monster\\" is usually written È≠çÈ≠é with radical- phonetic characters combining the \\"ghost radical\\" È¨º (typically used to write words concerning ghosts, demons, etc.) with phonetic elements of wang ÁΩî and liang ÂÖ© (lit. \\"deceive\\" and \\"two\\"). In Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BCE) usage, wangliang was also phonetically transcribed using the character pronunciations wang ÁΩî and liang ÂÖ©, and written ËùÑËúΩ with the \\"animal radical\\" Ëô´ (used to write names of insects, dragons, etc.) or wangliang ÁΩîÈñ¨ using liang Èñ¨ \\"dry moat\\" with the \\"gate radical\\" ÈñÄ (typically used to write architectural terminology). The earliest recorded usages of wangliang in the Chinese classics are: È≠çÈ≠é in the (c. 5th‚Äì4th century BCE) Guoyu, ÁΩîÂÖ© in the (c. 389 BCE) Zuozhuan, ÁΩîÈñ¨ in the (c. 91 BCE) Shiji, and ËùÑËúΩ in the (121 CE) Shuowen jiezi (or possibly the Kongzi Jiayu of uncertain date). While liang È≠é only occurs as a bound morpheme in wangliang, wang occurs in other expressions such as wangmei È≠çÈ≠Ö \\"evil spirits\\". W«éngli«éng \\"demons and monsters\\" frequently occurs in the synonym-compound chƒ´m√®iw«éngli«éng È≠ëÈ≠ÖÈ≠çÈ≠é \\"demons; monsters\\". Since commentators differentiate between chimei \\"demons of the mountains and forests\\" and wangliang \\"demons of the rivers and marshes\\", chimeiwangliang can mean either \\"demons; monsters; evil spirits\\" generally or \\"mountain demons and water demons\\" separately. For example, James Legge's (1872: 293) Zuozhuan translation syllabically splits chimeiwangliang into four types of demons, \\"the injurious things, and the hill-sprites, monstrous things, and water- sprites\\". Chinese scholars have identified wangxiang ÁΩîË±° and fangliang ÊñπËâØ as probable synonyms of wangliang < Old Chinese *ma≈ã îp.ra≈ã î È≠çÈ≠é (citing Baxter and Sagart's (2014) reconstructions). Wangxiang < *ma≈ã îs.[d]a≈ã î ÁΩîË±° means \\"water demon\\" and the reverse xiangwang < *s.[d]a≈ã îma≈ã î Ë±°ÁΩî means \\"a water ghost\\" in the Zhuangzi (which uses wangliang < *ma≈ã îp.ra≈ã î ÁΩîÂÖ© for the allegorical character Penumbra, see below). The Guoyu distinguishes wangliang ÁΩîÂÖ© \\"a tree and rock demon\\" and wangxiang ÁΩîË±° \\"a water demon\\" (see below). Fangliang < *pa≈ã[r]a≈ã ÊñπËâØ names a \\"graveyard demon\\", identified as the wangliang < *ma≈ã îp.ra≈ã î ÁΩîÂÖ©, that is exorcized in the Zhouli (below). A simple explanation for these phonological data and revolving identifications of demon names is that they were dialectic variations or corruptions of each other (de Groot 1910 5: 521). William G. Boltz (1979: 432‚Äì433) gives a more sophisticated interpretation that these were not just a confusion between various similar, but independent, names, but actually all variants of one and the same underlying designation: an initial consonantal cluster **BLjang ~ **BZjang \\"see\\". Citing Bernhard Karlgren's (1957) reconstructions of Old Chinese, Boltz gives *mjwang-ljang ÁΩîÂÖ© < **BLjang, *pjwang-ljang ÊñπËâØ < **BLjang, and *mjwang- dzjang ÁΩîË±° < **BZjang. Furthermore, if these names derived from a common protoform **BLjang or **BZjang \\"see\\", that implies that the spirits were not so much \\"demons\\" as \\"specters\\" (from Latin spectrum \\"appearance; apparition\\") or \\"visions\\". Another proposed etymology for xiangwang < *s.[d]a≈ã îma≈ã î Ë±°ÁΩî is the Austro-Tai root *s[u][y]a≈ã \\"spirit; god\\" (Benedict 1975:391, Carr 1988:96). The semantics of wangliang ÁΩîÂÖ© or È≠çÈ≠é are complicated, as evident in these translation equivalents of wangliang and wanggxiang ÁΩîË±° in major Chinese- English dictionaries. *ÁΩîÂÖ© see [È≠çÈ≠é]. ÁΩîË±° an imaginary monster which devours the brains of the dead underground. ‚Äî È≠ç[È≠é] A sprite; an elf. An animal which eats dead men's brains.

(Lin 1972) *È≠çÈ≠é demons and monsters (DeFrancis 2003) *È≠çÈ≠é demons and monsters (Kleeman and Yu 2010) Classical usages Wangliang first appears in the Chinese classics from around the 4th-century BCE and was used in a variety of sometimes contradictory meanings. While the dates of some early texts are uncertain, the following examples are roughly arranged chronologically. =Guoyu= The (5th‚Äì4th century BCE) Guoyu \\"Discourses of the States\\" quotes Confucius using wangliang È≠çÈ≠é and wangxiang ÁΩîË±° to explain ancient demon names to Ji Huanzi Â≠£Ê°ìÂ≠ê (d. 492 BCE) of Lu. > [Ji Huanzi], a grandee of the state of Lu, caused a well to be dug, when > they fetched up something like an earthen pot with a goat in it. He had > [Zhong Ni] (Confucius) interrogated about it, in these words: \\"I dug a well, > and got a dog; tell me what this is.\\" On which the Sage answered: \\"According > to what I have learned, it must be a goat; for I have heard that apparitions > between trees and rocks are called [Kui Â§î] and [wangliang], while those in > the water are [long Èæç] or dragons, and [wangxiang], and those in the ground > are called [fenyang ÁæµÁæä]. (È≠ØË™û‰∏ã, tr. de Groot 1910 5: 35) This mushi Êú®Áü≥ literally means \\"trees and rocks\\" and figuratively \\"inanimate beings; emotionlessness; indifference\\". Wei Zhao's commentary says the wangxiang supposedly eats humans and is also called the muzhong Êú®ËÖ´ \\"tree/wood swelling\\". The Shiji version of this story (de Groot 1910 5: 38), which is set in 507 BCE during the reign of Duke Ding of Jin, writes wangliang ÁΩîÈñ¨ with Èñ¨ \\"dry moat\\" and fenyang as Â¢≥Áæä \\"grave sheep\\" with Â¢≥ \\"grave; tomb\\" instead of ÁæµÁæä \\"spirit sheep\\" (cf. Huannanzi). =Zuozhuan= The (late 4th century BCE) Zuozhuan commentary to the (c. 6th‚Äì5th centuries BCE) Chunqiu history has an early, if not earliest, usage of chimeiwangliang Ëû≠È≠ÖÁΩîÂÖ©. This context describes how Yu the Great, legendary founder of the Xia Dynasty, ordered that the Nine Tripod Cauldrons be cast in order to acquaint people with all the dangerous demons and monsters found in China's Nine Provinces. > In the past when the Xia dynasty still possessed virtue, the distant lands > presented images of their strange creatures [shenjian Á•ûÂß¶ \\"spirit rape\\"] and > the heads of the nine provinces contributed bronze so that vessels were cast > which illustrated these creatures. Every kind of strange creature was > completely depicted in order that the common people would know the gods and > the demons. Thus, when people went to the rivers, lakes, mountains, and > forests, they did not encounter these adverse beings nor did the Chimei- > Hobgoblins in the hills and the Wangliang-Goblins in the waters accost them. > As a result, harmony was maintained between those above and those dwelling > on Earth below while everywhere, the people received the protection of > Heaven.

Strassberg 2002: 4) =Chuci= The \\"Seven Remonstrances\\" section (6th remonstrance, „ÄäÂìÄÂëΩ„Äã) of the c. 3rd‚Äì2nd century BCE Chuci (with some later additions) poetically uses wangliang ÁΩîÂÖ© to mean \\"feeling absentminded and baseless\\", according to Wang Yi's commentary. The context describes a river drowning suicide. > My fainting soul shrank back, oppressed; And as I lay, mouth full of water, > deep below the surface, The light of the sun seemed dim and very far above > me. Mourning for its body, dissolved now by decay; My unhoused spirit > drifted, disconsolate [ÁΩîÂÖ©]. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 255) =Zhuangzi= The (c. 3rd‚Äì2nd centuries BCE) Daoist Zhuangzi uses wangliang ÁΩîÂÖ© twice for naming the allegorical character Penumbra, wangxiang ÁΩîË±° meaning \\"a water ghost\\", and xiangwang Ë±°ÁΩî for the character Amorphous. Two Zhuangzi chapters tell similar versions of a dialogue between Wangliang ÁΩîÂÖ© Penumbra and Jing ÊôØ \\"bright; (measure by the) shadow\\" Shadow (in modern usage, \\"penumbra\\" is banying ÂçäÂΩ± \\"half shadow\\"). > Penumbra inquired of Shadow, saying, \\"One moment you move and the next > moment you stand still; one moment you're seated and the next moment you get > up. Why are you so lacking in constancy?\\" Shadow said, \\"Must I depend on > something else to be what I am? If so, must what I depend upon in turn > depend upon something else to be what it is? Must I depend upon the scales > of a snake's belly or the forewings of a cicada? How can I tell why I am > what I am? How can I tell why I 'm not what I'm not?\\" (2, tr. Mair 1994: 24; > cf. 27, 1994: 281) Wangxiang names a water demon Nonimagoes. When Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685‚Äì643 BCE) was upset by seeing a ghost in a marsh, his chancellor Guan Zhong asks a scholar from Qi named Master Leisurely Ramble [ÁöáÂ≠êÂëäÊïñ] about the different kinds of ghosts. > In pits there are pacers [Â±•]; around stoves there are tufties [È´ª]. > Fulgurlings [Èõ∑ÈúÜ] frequent dust piles inside the door; croakers [ÂÄçÈòø] and > twoads [ÈÆ≠Ë†™] hop about in low-lying places to the northeast; spillsuns [Ê≥ÜÈôΩ] > frequent low-lying places to the northwest. In water there are nonimagoes > [ÁΩîË±°]; on hills there are scrabblers [Â≥∑]; on mountains there are unipedes > [Â§î]; in the wilds there are will-o'-the-wisps [ÂΩ∑Âæ®]; and in marshes there are > bendcrooks [ÂßîËõá]. (19, tr. Mair 1994: 105) Xiangwang is the name of an allegorical character who discovers the xuanzhu ÁéÑÁè† \\"dark/mysterious pearl; Daoist truth\\" lost by the legendary Yellow Emperor. > The Yellow Emperor was wandering north of Redwater when he ascended the > heights of K'unlun and gazed toward the south. As he was returning home, he > lost his pearl of mystery. Knowledge [Áü•] was sent to search for the pearl, > but he couldn't find it. Spidersight [Èõ¢Êú±] was sent to search for the pearl, > but he couldn't find it. Trenchancy [Âñ´Ë©¨] was sent to search for the pearl, > but he couldn't find it, whereupon Amorphous [Ë±°ÁΩî] was sent and he found it. > \\"Extraordinary!\\" said the Yellow Emperor. \\"In the end, it was Amorphous who > was able to find it.\\" (12, tr. Mair 1994: 105) This allegory about the Yellow Emperor is part of the \\"knowledge story cycle\\" through which Zhuangzi illustrates the Daoist anti-epistemology of not knowing (Carr 1988). =Zhouli= The (1st century BCE ‚Äì 2nd century CE) Zhouli Rites of the Zhou Dynasty recorded that at a royal funeral, the Fangxiangshi ÊñπÁõ∏Ê∞è exorcist would leap into the grave and drive away any corpse-eating fangliang ÊñπËâØ, which Zheng Xuan's commentary identifies as the wangxiang. > It is incumbent on the Rescuer of the Country to cover himself with a bear‚Äôs > skin, to mask himself with four eyes of yellow metal, to put on a black coat > and a red skirt, and thus, lance in hand and brandishing a shield, to > perform, at the head of a hundred followers, a purification in every season > of the year, which means the finding out of (haunted) dwellings and driving > away contagious diseases. At royal funerals he walks ahead of the coffin > and, arriving at the grave, he leaps into the pit to beat the four corners > with his lance, in order to drive away the fang-liang spectres. (tr. Groot > 1910 1: 162‚Äì163) Li Shizhen's (1578) Bencao Gangmu \\"Compendium of Materia Medica\\" quotes this under the Wangliang entry (tr. Luo 2003: 4131). \\"Fangliang mentioned here is actually Wangliang. Wangliang loved to eat the livers of the dead, so people had to drive it away from tombs. It was afraid of tigers and arborvitae trees. That is why people placed stone tigers and plant arborvitae trees in graveyards.\\" Read (1931: no. 405) translates wangliang as \\"a sprite, an elf, the four eyed naiad\\". =Huainanzi= The (139 BCE) Huainanzi uses wangliang È≠çÈ≠é meaning \\"mindless; zombielike\\" and wangxiang ÁΩîË±° meaning \\"a water monster\\". The former occurs in a description of people's mentality during the mythological golden age of Fuxi and N√ºwa. > Their motions were calm and unhurried; their gaze was tranquil and > uncurious. In their ignorance, they all got what they needed to know. > Aimlessly drifting, they did not know what they were looking for; > zombielike, they did not know where they were going. (tr. Major 2010: 225) Major (fn. 69) explains that wangliang was \\"a kind of corpse monster, said to feed on the brains of the buried dead.\\" The latter occurs in context with Fenyang \\"a sheep-like earth deity\\" (cf. Guoyu above) and two mythical birds. > [When] water gives birth to waterbugs or clams, or mountains give birth to > gold and jade, people do not find it strange. ... But when mountains give > off Xiaoyang [Ê¢üÈôΩ], water gives birth to Wangxiang, wood gives birth to > Bifang [Áï¢Êñπ], and wells give birth to Fenyang [Â¢≥Áæä], people find it strange. > (tr. Major 2010: 522) =Lunheng= Wang Chong's (80 CE) Lunheng (tr. de Groot 1910 6: 938) quotes the (c. 2nd‚Äì1st century BCE) Liji (but not found in received text) that one of mythological emperor Zhuanxu's sons became a wangliang È≠çÈ≠é. > [Zhuanxu] had three sons living who, when they died, became the ghosts of > epidemics. One living in the water of the [Yangzi], became the Ghost of > Fever, the second in the [Luo] was a Water Spirit, the third, dwelling in > the corners of palaces and houses, and in damp storerooms, would frighten > children. (tr. Forke 1907: 242) Wolfram Eberhard (1968: 332, 193‚Äì195) notes this Luo River Ê¥õÊ∞¥ (cf. modern Luo Rivers) was supposedly in Yunnan, and associates wangliang with the mythological yu È≠ä \\"a three-legged tortoise that causes malaria\\". =Shuowen jiezi= Xu Shen's (121 CE) Shuowen jiezi defines wangliang ËõßËúΩ (tr. Knechtges 1983: 216): \\"It is a spectral creature of mountains and rivers. The King of Huainan says, \\"The appearance of the wangliang is like that of a three-year- old child, with a red-black color, red eyes, long ears, and beautiful hair.\\" The received Huannanzi text does not contain this royal quote. Gan Bao's (c. 350 CE) Soushenji \\"Records of Searching for Spirits\\" (tr. de Groot 1910 5: 521) similarly quotes the Xia dingji Â§èÈºéË®ò, \\"a [wangxiang] looks like a child of three years, has red eyes, a black color, big ears, and long arms with red claws. Even when fettered with ropes it can find its [human] food.\\" =Baopuzi= Ge Hong's (c. 320) Baopuzi mentions wangliang È≠çÈ≠é twice. One context lists the demon among the dangers facing stupid people who walk in mountain valleys. > Or they may be devoured by a tiger or a wolf; slain by a wang-liang demon > (in the form of a brown child with red eyes, long ears, and a fine head of > hair); or become hungry and remain without a method for dispensing with > starchy foods; or become cold and lack a method for warming themselves. (6, > tr. Ware 1966: 114) This translation adds a summarized Shuowen jiezi description. In the other context, Ge Hong quotes oral directions from his master Zheng Yin ÈÑ≠Èö± (c. 215-c. 302) about preserving zhenyi Áúü‰∏Ä \\"Truth-Unity\\". > Unity is not hard to know; persistence is the difficulty. Guard it without > loss, and you will never know exhaustion. On land, It routs evil animals; on > water, dispels crocodiles and dragons. No fear of demons, nor of poisonous > insects. Ghost will not dare approach, nor blades strike. (18, tr. Ware > 1966: 304) =Shuyiji= The Shuyiji Ëø∞Áï∞Ë®ò \\"Records of Strange Things\\", compiled by Ren Fang ‰ªªÊòâ (460‚Äì508), has a story about finding a fangxiang ÊñπÁõ∏ \\"demon that eats brains of the dead\\", also called fushu ÂºóËø∞ \\"not state\\" or ao Â™™ \\"old woman\\". The Bencao gangmu quotes the story and records medicinally using the brain of the brain-eating Fangxiang. > The book Shuyi Ji: In the Qin Dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC) once an animal was caught > by a hunter in Chencang [Èô≥ÂÄâ]. It looked like a cross between a pig and a > sheep. The hunter did not know what it was. At this time two young boys > appeared. When asked, the boys said that it was called Fushu or Ao. It ate > the brains of the dead in tombs. When a twig of arborvitae was inserted into > its head, it would die. Although such things are not related to medicine, > they concern the dead. So they are also recorded here for reference. Such an > animal is called Fangxiang. If it has four eyes it is called Qi. Such things > are all devils. In ancient times people made statues of human beings to > represent such ghosts. It was recorded that Mr. Fei Zhangfang [Ë≤ªÈï∑Êàø] once > made medicinal pills of Li E [ÊùéÂ®•] that contained the brain of Fangxiang as > an ingredient. This prescription has been lost. (tr.

Known as the OC, or the Winged 'O' ruggers, the rugby team was formed in 1908 under the wing of the San Francisco Olympic Club, an athletic club and private social club which had been founded in 1860. Olympic Club Rugby is one of the oldest rugby clubs in California and has produced a number of notable players who have represented the United States national team. These include Olympic gold medal winners from 1920 and 1924, Charles Doe, Dink Templeton, George Dixon, and Rudy Scholz. More recent U.S. Eagles representatives include Brian McClenahan and Colin Hawley. History =Early years= The game of rugby in the Bay Area received a boost in 1906 when, citing concerns about the safety of American football, the universities of California and Stanford dropped football in favor of rugby. The Big Game was played as rugby from 1906 to 1914. In 1907 an Englishman and rugby devotee named Edgar Pomeroy joined the San Francisco Olympic Club and lobbied for the formation of a rugby team. With the support of the club president and the board, the Olympic Club rugby team was formed in 1908, playing five other teams including Stanford and University of California in the first season. The club won the local championship the next season, in 1909. Pomeroy and fellow Olympic Club member Joseph Hickey became officials with the California Rugby Union. They arranged a series of touring matches to the West Coast for New Zealand's All Blacks team in 1913. On October 4th, the Olympic Club played the champion All Blacks side at St. Ignatius Field. While the OC lost 19‚Äì0 it was a closer match than the game played a month later in which the United States national side was defeated 51‚Äì3. New Zealander Jim Wylie stayed in California after the tour, later joining the Olympic Club and becoming a coach of the side. The colleges resumed playing American football after 1914 but rugby had gained a toehold in the Bay Area. =1990 onwards= References Category:Sports teams in San Francisco Category:Rugby union teams in San Francisco Category:Rugby clubs established in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in California ","title":"Olympic Club RFC"},{"id":"45189937","text":"Trichodes quadriguttatus is a beetle species of checkered beetles belonging to the family Cleridae, subfamily Clerinae.

However, he severed relations with her against his will as he thought it was the best thing to do. He just tried to keep his morals as a doctor. But their separation left her with the feeling of deep hurt instead. She got worse when they met again after some time. The poor patient asked again her beloved doctor to go out together with a pat expression, \\"let's go out, anywhere!\\".

It was located at No. 67 Greene Street, and Nos. 68 to 74 Wooster Street, in New York City, New York. Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company manufactured fixtures for gas and electric lights -- separately for gas or electricity, or combined for both. The fixtures were found in the residences of the Vanderbilts and Marquands of New York, as well as Potter Palmer's of Chicago. They also equipped Madison Square Garden, Manhattan Athletic Club, Equitable Life, and United States Trust. In San Francisco, their work appeared in the Palace Hotel; in Indianapolis, in the Indiana State Capitol; and in Hartford, in the Connecticut State Capitol. History Chandelier of tubular construction by Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company This business was originally established as Archer, Pancoast & Company, in 1859, the co-partnership consisting of Ellis S. Archer, William C. Ellison and George Pancoast. From a modest beginning, the operations of business steadily grew, and in a few years it had won a national reputation for the artistic excellence of its products. In 1868, the business had increased to such extensive proportions that a stock company was organized and incorporated under the laws of New York State, with a capital of US$300,000. The mammoth factory and warehouse were located at No. 67 Greene Street, extending through to Nos. 68, 70, 72 and 74 Wooster Street. The factory was arranged and equipped with the modern machinery and appliances, the majority of which were specially designed and built for these works. A force of 350 skilled mechanics was employed at one time. Each department was under the management of a manager, and the whole was regulated by a system which both facilitated business and assured the prompt execution of orders. The position that Archer & Pancoast attained in the production of gas fixtures, chandeliers, electric light fixtures and artistic metal work was universally recognized throughout the US. Their show rooms featured displays, one of which was a great attraction to visitors. The company fitted up with gas-fixtures some of the largest public edifices throughout the country. Hundreds of New York's palatial private residences and extensive commercial buildings also contained their artistic products. The company did an extensive wholesale trade throughout the country. They had branch offices located in Boston and Chicago, both of which were heavily stocked with their specialties. As the business grew, Robert and Ogden Goelet erected 900 Broadway, a new and extensive building for Archer & Pancoast at 20th Street and Broadway. The factory was a six-story brick building, erected in 1888. The Archer & Pancoast Company, incorporated in 1868. It had a paid-up capital of $600,000 by 1892, and employed 500 workmen. By 1896, the Archer & Pancoast Company had salesrooms at Nos. 18 and 20 West 25th Street, Manhattan, and a factory at Flushing and Carlton avenues, Brooklyn. It went into the hands of receivers, on August 19, 1896. Justice Smyth, of the Supreme Court appointed Albert C. Hetherington, William S. Fearing and Peter F. Meyer receivers, with a bond of $100,000, on the application of President Pancoast and other directors of the company. Mr. Fearing was vice-president and general manager; Paul Thompson, treasurer and Mr. Hetherington, a director. Thomas B. Odell was appointed referee, and the order to show cause for the dissolution was set down for February 5, 1897. It was said by the officers that the company was insolvent, that it had recently found it impossible to obtain money in any considerable quantity owing to the financial stringency all over the US, and that within the last week, the bank with which the company had always done business had refused further to extend its line of discount. To save the assets from slaughter and make the best possible disposition of the property, the officers deemed it best to apply for receivers. The total liabilities are $806,780, and the nominal assets $821,063. Of the liabilities, $705,017 were mortgage liens on all the property of the company, except accounts receivable. These mortgages were for purchase money of factory, $55,000; to secure notes, $267,482, and to secure income bonds, $378,465. There was due for merchandise $51,025 and for loans by stockholders $37,074. The assets consisted of real estate and factory in Brooklyn, $200,000; machinery, $201,552; models, patterns, $100,000; merchandise, $139,037; improvements at factory, $17,844; store fixtures, $12,000; goods in the New York store, $37,067; stock of other companies, $11,000; and accounts receivable, $102,563. Of the accounts, $18,000 was probably uncollectable, and $14,414 had been pledged to secure advances. The officers believed that there would be no equity in the assets which were covered by the mortgage liens leaving only the accounts to pay the unsecured debts. The company did not have Bradstreet's rating. It was a reorganization of the old Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company, which went into the hands of receivers in May 1893, with liabilities of $1,100,000. The property was sold to the Reorganization Committee tor $600,000. and the newer company was formed by the creditors in November, 1894, to carry on the business. About 400 persons were employed by the company at this time.

It is made from a paste of urad dal and winter melon which is sun-dried for 3‚Äì5 days. Once fully dried, it can easily last for about a year. Bori making The paste is laid out by hand on a mat in the sunlight. It sticks to the mat while wet but when the bori dries completely it can easily come off. In its simplest form bori takes the conical shape naturally occurring due to the way the paste is laid out. Intricate artistic designs can also made with the paste when squeezed out through a piping bag. This is called naksha bori. It is also called gohona bori or gayna bori because the designs often look like those of jewellery (gahana or gayna is Bengali for jewellery). To avoid breaking naksha bori when removing from the mat, a layer of poppy seeds is spread before laying the paste. The district of Purba Medinipur is famous for its naksha bori. Preparing bori is almost exclusively done by women of the household, sometimes assisted by children. Contrary to the common notion, it is not grown on trees. Bori can be fried and eaten as a snack or can be added to fish or vegetable dishes to enhance taste and to add variety.

Awards In 2003, NBHSTHS was the only recipient of the Governor's Award for Community Service and Volunteerism, a prestigious award that recognizes schools with amazing community service programs. History The school was created around the Health Professions Scholars Program, which had since 1992 given students at New Brunswick High School the opportunity to learn about health careers, shadow RWJUH workers for a month and work at the hospital over the summer. Impressed by the program's success, the district decided to create an entire school focused upon it. The building itself, a modular three-story building, was constructed and equipped by I.E.P. on land provided by RWJUH. Its doors opened in 1999. Academic program The school has a rigorous academic program. Students that fail to maintain a 3.0 GPA are transferred to the New Brunswick High School. All students are expected to take four years of mathematics and science and three years of a world language, which exceeds the minimum requirements as stated by New Jersey and the New Brunswick Board of Education.NBHSTHS Time Tracker, 2013 ed. Students may only take the minimum requirement of art and music courses throughout their time at the school, one year total of each. =Health Professions Scholars= Throughout their time at the school, students participate in the Health Professions Scholars Program (HPSP), which gives students the opportunity to explore healthcare professions. This program begins in grades 9 and 10 with monthly lectures about various health careers. Juniors shadow professionals and explore careers at the hospital and experience other healthcare facilities of interest, and take an EMS First Aid course. Seniors intern with allied healthcare professionals in an experience that culminates with an oral presentation. Student body The class of 2015-16 had a 100% graduation rate. 77.2% of students went to a four-year college, 11.4% went to a two-year college, and 11.4% went elsewhere. All students at NBHSTHS can currently get free lunch. Extracurricular activities The school offers several academic extracurricular activities. Among them are the Johnson&Johnson; Bridge to Employment program, the Rutgers Future Scholars Program, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey's CREHST and CURE programs, a National Honor Society chapter, and several other Rutgers-based programs; the school also has several afterschool clubs and its annual talent show, \\"Techies got Talent\\".NBHSTHS Extracurricular Programs.

Almost nothing is known about his early years, but a document dated 1537 affirms that he had been in the service of the Toledo Cathedral for 62 years. This suggests that he entered the cathedral in 1475 as a choirboy. In June 1490 he became master of the choirboys (claustrero), replacing Juan de Triana in the post. In 1495 he succeeded in obtaining a prebend as a singer in open contest; according to the rules, the winner would be the \\"most accomplished and fluent singer\\" among the contestants, and highly trained in polyphonic composition. In 1507 he was seriously ill and does not seem to have resumed his duties as claustrero after this time. He held at least two chaplaincies at the cathedral and between 1530 and 1534 was maestro de ceremonias. By 1537, being deaf and blind, he asked to be relieved of his duties as chaplain; he died towards the end of 1543. Works The only works by Lagarto that survived to our days were the ones included in one or more cancioneros of his time. Four works have been explicitly attributed to him in the Cancionero Musical de Palacio: (: *Andad, pasiones, andad - villancico for 3vv *Callen todas las galanas - villancico for 3vv *D'aquel fraire flaco - villancico for 4vv *Qu√©xome de ti, ventura - romance for 3vv The villancicos draw on different themes: Andad, pasiones, andad is a love song also included in the Cancionero de la Colombina and in the Cancionero de Segovia; Callen todas las galanas compares the women of Toledo and Seville; and D'aquel fraire flaco is an anticlerical satire. The romance, Qu√©xome de ti, ventura, is a lament against the twists of Fortune. No sacred works in Latin have survived.  Bibliography  *H.

Officially, it was known as Agreement on Persons of Indian Origin in Ceylon. It was a significant agreement in determining the status and future of people of Indian origin in Ceylon.  Background  During the British rule, Tamils from Tamil Nadu were recruited to work in tea, coffee and coconut plantations of Ceylon. Due to continuous recruitment and population growth, of Indian Tamils constituted 13.5 percent (602,700) of the total population in 1921. By 1936, Indian Tamils numbered 1,123,000, 15.3 percent of the total population in 1936, and many of them were non-citizens of Ceylon. Sinhalese nationalists resented the growth of the Tamil population and pressured the government to send them back to India. Therefore the government introduced the Ceylon Citizenship Bill. The act came into force in 1948, and it granted citizenship to about 5,000 Indian Tamils. However, more than 700,000 people (about 11%) were either non-citizens of Ceylon or became stateless. The Indian and Pakistani Residents Citizenship Act (1949) also failed to solve the issues. In 1954, the Nehru-Kotelawala Pact was signed to deal with the same issue. Nevertheless, the issue remained unsolved. In 1962, there were nearly 975,000 people, classified by Ceylon as \\"Indian nationals\\" and by India as \\"stateless\\". Although India denied any legal responsibility for these people, it acknowledged a \\"sentimental interest\\" in them.  Pact  In 1964, both countries had newly elected prime ministers, and a new round of negotiations were initiated. The negotiations were initially scheduled to last four days, but eventually ended up taking six. On several occasions they came close to collapse. Finally, both countries agreed to a pact, negotiating a formula that satisfied both governments. The central part of the pact was the granting of Ceylonese citizenship to 300,000 of the Indian population in Sri Lanka, while 525,000 would be repatriated to India. It was agreed that the citizenship of the remaining 150,000 Indian residents of Ceylon would be negotiated at a later point.  Aftermath  The pact was criticized in various ways, especially on the procedure for its implementation. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, father figure of the Sri Lankan Tamil community, said \\"It is an unprecedented move in international relations for half a million people to be treated as pawns in the game of power politics\\". In 1981, it was estimated that only 280,000 had been repatriated to India, and 160,000 granted Sri Lankan citizenship. India was slow to grant Indian citizenship and implement the repatriation. In 1982, India declared that it no longer considered the pact binding as its implementation period had expired. In 1984, the Sri Lankan civil war caused the suspension of the ferry service between the two countries, bringing an end to repatriations. The problem of statelessness among Indian Tamils in Sri Lanka was finally resolved in 2003, with the Grant of Citizenship to Persons of Indian Origin Act, which granted Sri Lankan citizenship to those of Indian origin who had lived in Sri Lanka since the Sirima‚ÄìShastri Pact was agreed in October 1964.

The NBN operated over 38 miles of track from Wabeno, Wisconsin north to Tipler, Wisconsin. History In 1896, a company named the Wisconsin Northern Railway was organized to build 115 miles of track north from a junction near Gillett on the Chicago & Northwestern line. Forty-six miles of track were completed as far as Wabeno in 1897, and the line was purchased immediately by C&NW; and merged into the system, in 1899 the line was extended to Siding 62, about five miles north of Laona. This was as far as it could go without crossing the Soo Line north of Laona. After a Lengthy Legal Struggle, the C&NW; was finally allowed to cross the Soo tracks at grade in 1905. Pulpwood was practically the only business on the Laona Line by the end of 1961. Traffic volume continued to drop off until operation was reduced to a single train a week. In 1979, the ICC gave C&NW; permission to abandon the line. As reported in the Summer 1983 Northwestern Line Magazine, a 37.79-mile segment of the line between Wabeno and Tipler was sold for continued operation as a short line. The last time a Chicago & Northwestern crew operated a train on the Laona Line was June 29, 1979. The line was bought by WISDOT the same year, when the C&NW; abandoned it.

This phrase has recently been asserted in reference to American college football, especially referring to the winners of the CFP National Championship Game, which has since the 2014 season been intended to determine a national champion. Its validity in regards to the CFP Playoff's champion is hotly contested. The term \\"undisputed national championship\\" is meant to be the opposite of the \\"mythical national championship\\" which was awarded separately, and often controversially, by several different polling agencies, resulting in many controversial split titles. College Football =History of National Championships in College Football= Since the establishment of college football in 1869, National titles were split for much of its history. The 1869 season saw only two games, a home-and-home series between Rutgers and Princeton, and with each team winning one game, both schools claim the 1869 national championship. Princeton won the following year's national title by winning its only game of the season, while Rutgers went 1-1 and Columbia losing their only game. This was the first undisputed title in college football history. From 1893 to 1906, the title was split 13 out of 14 seasons. Perhaps the widest split title in college football history occurred in 1921, when six separate schools were all declared national champions of the same season. From 1910 to 1942, not one single title was undisputed. the 1943, 1948, 1963, 1971, and 1972 seasons ended with a single undisputed champion, but the next one to follow that would be the 2013 championship won by Florida State. In all, in the century from 1910 to 2009, multiple schools were awarded the championship 95 times. Many college football historians combat the severe splitting of titles by only recognizing titles issued by the AP Poll or the Coaches' Poll, and calling titles issued by both \\"consensus national championships\\" Bowl Coalition, Bowl Alliance, and BCS Eras Beginning in the 1990s, agreements were struck between college football's major conferences to try to arrange #1 vs #2 match ups in postseason bowl games. The hope was that it would give either team a chance to prove they were number one and earn consensus national championships. The system worked effectively to produce a single consensus national champion in every season from 1992-1996, 1998-2002, and 2004-2013, but considerable controversy erupted each year over who the participants in the championship game should be. The 2003 national championship was split between the major polls for the only time during the BCS era because computer rankings contributing to the BCS formula denied USC a top-two spot and a bid to the BCS National Championship game. CFP era Since the 2014 season, the College Football Playoff, culminating in the CFP National Championship Game, has provided a means for all of the top-4 teams in the nation to compete against each other, allowing one of the teams to come away with two wins over top-4 opponents in consecutive, season ending weeks. This system is designed to entirely eliminate split tiles and crown a single championship. The system worked immediately, giving the Ohio State Buckeyes a title in its very first year. In its fourth year, it failed to produce an undisputed champion, as both its champion (Alabama) and undefeated UCF claimed the title.

The march followed the first large-scale joint German-Italian counter-insurgency operation in the NDH, Operation Trio, and the combined Italian-Montenegrin Chetnik offensive in Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina. The majority of the units of the National Liberation Army (1st and 2nd Proletarian, 3rd Sand≈æak and 4th Montenegrin Brigades) and the Supreme Headquarters of the NOV and POJ set out from the territory of Mt Zelengora on June 24, 1942, for western Bosnia. Along the way, battles were fought with the enemy (Konjic, Bugojno, Prozor, Livno, Kupres) and a new liberated territory was created. At the end of July, the 5th Montenegrin Brigade joined these forces with the Herzegovinian NOP Detachment, from which the 10th Herzegovinian Proletarian Strike Brigade was then formed. The campaign in Bosnian Krajina was not intended as a march, but to strike at the enemy, expand free territory in western Bosnia and create favorable conditions for further development of the uprising in the western parts of Yugoslavia, so it was planned to be carried out gradually, in stages. In the first stage, a sudden attack was to break and destroy enemy crews and destroy the Sarajevo-Mostar railway, and then, in the next stage, continue to advance to the northwest, take control of the territory on the right bank of the Neretva, in the upper Vrbas and Kupres, Livno, Imotski and connect with Krajina and Dalmatian units.  Background  = Partisan forces in early 1942= During the first six months of 1942, the partisans suffered heavy losses in Second and Third Enemy Offensives in eastern Bosnia, Herzegovina, Sand≈æak and Montenegro. Because of these losses, as well as because of the successful Chetnik subversion in many partisan detachments, and to some extent also because of some serious mistakes in the so-called Leftist errors, partisan activity in the those areas almost died out, and the partisan position became critical. At the same time, the Chetniks became stronger in these areas, partly due to subversion in partisan detachments, partly due to collaboration with the Italians, and in some areas with the Croatian Quisling forces to some extent, and thus indirectly with the Germans. At the beginning of March 1942, the Supreme Headquarters sent the 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigades to eastern Bosnia, where they overwhelmed Chetnik forces and liberated the region, thus providing significant assistance to the partisan forces there. In the first months of 1942, Montenegrin partisans kept most of Montenegro in their hands, despite increased pressure from Italians and Chetniks. By the joint action of the 2nd Proletarian Brigade, Herzegovinian and Montenegrin partisans, Boraƒç, a strong Ustashe stronghold, near Kalinovik, was liberated. With the liberation of Kalinovik, the liberated territory of eastern Bosnia was connected with the liberated territory in Herzegovina and Montenegro. In western Bosnia, partisan detachments grew, consolidating free territory and liberating new areas. The insurgent forces in Grmeƒç and Kozara increased especially, and on May 16, 1942, the 1st and 2nd Krajina detachments liberated Prijedor, which was defended by about 2,000 enemy soldiers. =German-Italian offensive= In order to prevent the further spread of the uprising, Germans and Italians, on 3 March 1942, in Opatija, signed an agreement which reached a plan for a general offensive against the partisans. According to that plan, the first operations began on 15 April 1942 in eastern Bosnia, for the purpose of which the \\"Bader\\" battle group was formed. The goal of this operation was to destroy partisan units in the area of Rogatica- Kalinovik-Foƒça. Due to the delays of the Italian divisions, which were held back by partisan forces in Herzegovina, as well as the successful resistance of the 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigades and other partisan forces, the enemy's plan failed. 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigades managed to move to Sand≈æak and Montenegro, and partly to Herzegovina, to help the partisan forces, to which the Italians, with a very strong force of about 9 divisions, launched an offensive in mid-1942, and managed to master these areas by the end of June.  March to Bosnian Krajina  The Supreme Headquarters, which was in Foƒça until 10 May 1942, managed, with the help of the 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigades, to withdraw part of the partisan forces from Montenegro and Herzegovina and form new units from them: 3rd Proletarian Sand≈æak Brigade, 4th and 5th Proletarian Montenegrin Brigade and the Herzegovina Detachment. Decision of Partisan Supreme HQ to move west proved to be very prudent for a number of reasons, the most important of which was the fact that the Italians, on the basis of the Zagreb agreement concluded on June 19, withdrew a large part of their troops from zones II and III. Ustashe regime had neither the time nor the strength to adequately protect these areas. Group of brigades, which consisted of: the 1st and 2nd Proletarian, 3rd Sand≈æak and 4 Montenegrin Brigades, together the Supreme Headquarters, moved from the Zelengora region on 24 June 1942 to western Bosnia in the general direction Kalinovik-Prozor- Kupres. 5th Proletarian Montenegrin Brigade and the Herzegovinian Detachment with a partisan hospital were left on the border of Herzegovina, Montenegro and Bosnia, in order to penetrate Montenegro and Herzegovina in a more favorable situation. After managing to break up the Ustasha forces around the Treskavica mountain, on 3 July 1942, partisan brigades carried out a surprise attack on the Sarajevo-Konjic railway between Had≈æiƒái and Konjic. During the night, the brigades defeated the enemy crews at the stations, destroyed important station facilities, destroyed the railway in several places, as well as all important bridges. Dozens of wagons and several locomotives were destroyed. = Attack on Konjic = After a series of diversions on the railway, 1st Proletarian Brigade broke up the enemy garrison in Konjic on the night between July 7 and 8, defending a battalion of Croatian Home Guard and two Ustasha companies, liberated the city and destroyed the railway station and furnace with about 25 locomotives. This was a major blow to the occupying forces and the NDH, because ties with Herzegovina were severed for more than two months and the transport of bauxite from the Mostar region was prevented. From the railway, partisan brigades Group continued its operations in two directions: the right column, composed of 2nd Proletarian and 4th Montenegrin Brigade, attacked the enemy garrisons in the upper course of the Vrbas via Bitovanje and Vranica; the left column, made up of 1st Proletarian and 3rd Sand≈æak Brigades, headed in the direction of Prozor-Livno. After the capture of Gornji Vakuf, the right column fought fierce battles around Bugojno and Donji Vakuf, while the left column liberated Prozor, ≈†ujica and Duvno, and in cooperation with the Dalmatian and Krajina partisans liberated Livno on August 5. = Attack on Livno = The liberation of Livno was a great success of the NOVJ. 2nd Battalion of the 1st Proletarian Brigade invaded the city through clearings, high wire barriers and between masonry-concrete bunkers, destroyed the enemy forces it encountered, severed ties and disrupted the enemy's command, and cooperated with other battalions attacking the city. The Ustasha garrison had losses of about 200 dead (including those executed), with its own losses of 5 dead and 20 wounded. Partisans seized all weapons and ammunition, including 6 tons of explosives. About 300 captured members of Home Guard were disarmed and released, and 12 Germans were captured, who were employees of Organization Todt, that was engaged in the economic exploitation of the occupied areas. These Germans would exchanged in September for captured partisans and arrested activists. This would the first exchange of prisoners between Partisan forces on the one hand, and the German authorities on the other. At the beginning of August, 5th Proletarian Montenegrin Brigade and the Herzegovinian Detachment arrived in the liberated Prozor, and after fierce fighting with the Axis and Chetnik forces in the wider region of Zelengora, they were forced to move in this direction. = Attack on Kupres = Soldiers of 4th Montenegrin Brigade in Janj area, near ≈†ipovo. Particularly difficult battles were fought group of partisan brigades, composed of 2nd Proleterian and 4th Montenegrin Brigades, parts of 3rd Sand≈æak and 10th Herzegovinian Brigades (formed on August 10 by the Herzegovinian Detachment and the Konjic Partisan Battalion), together with 1st Krajina Brigade and 3rd Krajina Detachment for Kupres from 11 to 14 August.  Aftermath  = Merging free territory = Partisans in Bihaƒá, autumn of 1942 In further battles, Proleterian brigades with the Krajina and Dalmatian units liberated: Ar≈æano, Mrkonjiƒá Grad and Jajce. This created the conditions for the development of the partisan movement in the areas that had been under the influence of the Ustashas until then, and the newly liberated territory was connected with the liberated territory in the Bosnian Krajina via Livno and Mrkonjiƒá Grad. At the end of August, partisan brigades reached Bosanski Petrovac via Drvar. Preparations for the attack on Bihaƒá and the establishment of the Bihaƒá Republic will follow. = Axis and Quisling reactions = Soldiers of 4th Montenegrin Brigade carry their wounded comrades after battle of Jajce Although in autumn 1942 Partisans would be forced to leave Prozor to the Italians, Livno to the Croatian quisling forces, and Jajce to the Germans, the partisans nevertheless controlled the area from the western approaches to the Neretva in the south to Karlovac in the north, an area of 250 km in length and 40 - 70 km in width. The crisis of partisan war fortunes seemed to have passed: they now had nine divisions and many independent partisan detachments, their military organization strengthened, they built a system of civilian government in those areas in the form of national liberation committees, and they confirmed themselves politically by convening an assembly in newly liberated Bihaƒá, which was constituted as the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ). It was obvious that they were now able to intensify their activity against the Axis and the Croatian Quisling forces, as well as against the Chetniks.

History  French scholar Alexis Pichard has argued that TV series enjoyed a Second Golden AgeTV's golden age is real: The end of channel surfing The Economist starting in the 2000s which was a combination of three elements: first, an improvement in both visual aesthetics and storytelling; second, an overall homogeneity between cable series and networks series; and third, a tremendous popular success. Pichard contends that this Second Golden Age was the result of a revolution initiated by the traditional networks in the 1980s and carried on by the cable channels (especially HBO) in the 1990s.Pichard, 2011, p.11 Film director Francis Ford Coppola thinks that the second golden age of television comes from \\"kids\\" with their \\"little father's camcorder\\", who wanted to make films like he did in the 1970s but were not permitted to, so they did it for television.Francis Ford Coppola: 'Apocalypse Now is not an anti-war film' The Guardian The new Golden Age turned on creator-driven tragic dramas of the 2000s and 2010s, including Buffy The Vampire SlayerThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.191and OzThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.19, which both first aired in 1997; 1999's The SopranosThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.32 and The West Wing; 2001's Six Feet Under and 24The Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.218; 2002's The WireThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.69 and The ShieldThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.130, 2004's DeadwoodThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.96 and Battlestar GalacticaThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.243; 2005's Avatar: The Last Airbender; 2006's Friday Night LightsThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.272; 2007's Mad MenThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.301; 2008's Breaking BadThe Revolution Was Televised by Alan Sepinwall pg.336; and 2011's Game of Thrones.

Origins  The Golden Age of television is believed to have resulted from advances in media distribution technology, digital TV technology (including HDTV, online video platforms, TV streaming, video-on-demand, and web TV), and a large increase in the number of hours of available television, which has prompted a major wave of content creation. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice has argued that the current golden age began earlier with network shows like Babylon 5 and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (both of which premiered in 1993), and Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).Zacharek, Stephanie (2015). \\"Why Avengers: Age of Ultron Fills this Buffy Fan with Despair\\". The Village Voice. Will Gompertz of the BBC believes that Friends, which debuted in 1994, might stake a claim as the opening bookend show of the period. Matt Zoller Seitz argues that it began in the 1980s with Hill Street Blues (1981) and St. Elsewhere (1982). Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku has said that Avatar: The Last Airbender (2005) should be considered a part of the golden age of television, and recommended \\"the sophisticated kids show\\" to others.kotaku.com With the rise of instant access to content on Netflix, creator-driven television shows like Breaking Bad, The Shield (2002), Friday Night Lights (2006) and Mad Men gained cult followings that grew to become widely popular. The success of instant access to television shows was presaged by the popularity of DVDs, and continues to increase with the rise of digital platforms and online companies. The increase in the number of shows is also cited as evidence of a Golden Age, or \\"peak TV\\". In the five years between 2011 and 2016, the number of scripted television shows, on broadcast, cable and digital platforms increased by 71%. In 2002, 182 television shows aired, while 2016 had 455 original scripted television shows and 495 in 2018. The number of shows are rising largely due to companies like Netflix, Amazon Video and Hulu investing heavily in original content. The number of shows aired by online service increased from only one in 2009 to over 93 in 2016. John Landgraf, the CEO of FX Networks, has stated that the amount of television series being aired during peak TV could be overwhelming for the viewer to choose from, especially for critics obligated to review as many shows as possible, which results in a decreased output of television series in the future. An increasing reliance on rebooting and reviving existing franchises led to widespread belief that the Golden Age of Television was ending in the late 2010s, with the caveat that some of these reboots (such as Girl Meets World and One Day at a Time) share the positive reception and mature character development of original shows of the era.  Characteristics and criticism Characteristics of this golden age are complicated characters who may be morally ambiguous or antiheroes, questionable behavior, complex plots, diverse perspectives and often forays into R-rated territory.Why Is the Golden Age of TV So Dark?

He made his professional debut in November 2002. He is the 21st Mongolian to reach the top makuuchi division, which he achieved in May 2014. His 68-tournament rise through the ranks is the second-slowest progress for a foreign wrestler after Sent≈çry≈´. He won three kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He was a member of three stables, Araiso, Hanakago and Minezaki. His highest rank was maegashira 2. Early life and sumo background In his childhood he was active in sports such as basketball and swimming. He also lived in Indonesia for a time in his younger years. At the 2002 junior sumo tournament, he impressed then active Kyokush≈´zan with his ability and soon afterward he entered Araiso stable. He debuted in November of that same year in maezum≈ç at the height of and weighing . Career =Early career= From his November 2002 debut, he rose slowly but steadily through the ranks over three years, recording mostly winning tournaments. However, in the January 2006 tournament he dislocated his left shoulder and had to drop out. He also missed the following tournament. After this his shoulder became prone to dislocating and upon his seventh dislocation he elected to finally have corrective surgery upon completing the May 2007 tournament. Rehabilitation from the surgery forced him to sit out three tournaments. He dropped from makushita 22 down to jonidan 22 in this period. During this time he studied the techniques of former yokozuna Chiyonofuji who long suffered from an easily dislocated shoulder. Upon his return in January 2008, his sumo was back in form and he recorded three 6‚Äì1 consecutive tournaments. However, in September of that year, Araiso stable closed upon the retirement of its owner, the former Futagodake. While the other wrestlers in the stable chose to retire, he chose to remain active and transferred to Hanakago stable. He continued his steady rise through the ranks, recording only one or two losing tournaments a year. In the May 2011 technical tournament which was not televised due to the ramifications of widespread match-fixing he managed only a 3‚Äì4 record at makushita 3. This normally would have led to a drop in rank. However, he was one of a number of wrestlers who benefited from the dismissal of several high- ranking wrestlers for match-fixing and he was actually promoted to the salaried j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time in his career in the July 2011 tournament. He only managed a 5‚Äì10 record at j≈´ry≈ç 13 and was demoted back to makushita 3. He repeated this same feat twice more, taking a number of tournaments to rise to j≈´ry≈ç and being relegated after a single losing tournament back to the unsalaried makushita division. During this period, in 2012, Hanakago stable had to close due to financial difficulties. He then transferred to his third stable, Minezaki. Starting in the September 2013 tournament he begin to be more consistent, and posted two strong 6‚Äì1 consecutive tournaments to achieve promotion to j≈´ry≈ç for the fourth time in the January 2014 tournament. He debuted at a then career high rank of j≈´ry≈ç 10 and managed an 8‚Äì7 record. A 10‚Äì5 record in the following March tournament garnered him his first promotion to the makuuchi top division for the May 2014 tournament. =Makuuchi career= Arawashi was the 21st Mongolian to make it to the top division following Terunofuji. At the beginning of his career, Arawashi had entered sumo at the same time as Koto≈çsh≈´ but was soon left behind as Koto≈çsh≈´ made one of the fastest-ever rises to makuuchi and ultimately ≈çzeki. Arawashi had stated that one of his goals was to make it to makuuchi and once again face Koto≈çsh≈´ in the ring. However, he would never realize this goal, as Koto≈çsh≈´ retired, his name being taken off the banzuke the same tournament that Arawashi's was added to makuuchi. Arawashi alternated between winning and losing tournaments before a calamitous 2‚Äì13 record in May 2015 saw him demoted back to the j≈´ry≈ç division. He returned to the top division in July 2016 and came through with a winning record. In November 2016 he produced a career-best performance as a final day win over Sh≈çdai saw him end with an 11‚Äì4 record and a promotion to maegashira 2 for the January tournament. In this tournament he started with five straight losses but then defeated yokozuna Kakury≈´ on Day 6 to earn his first kinboshi. It took him 85 tournaments from his professional debut to get a kinboshi, the seventh-slowest of all time. He then defeated Hakuh≈ç on Day 8, meaning his only two wins of the tournament at that point had come against yokozuna. He finished with a 6‚Äì9 record. In the March 2017 tournament he had his third career win over a yokozuna, defeating Harumafuji. However, he had to withdraw from the tournament on Day 13 after injuring his ankle. He returned to the maegashira 2 ranking in March 2018, but scored only 2‚Äì13. After a run of poor results he was demoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division after the July 2018 tournament. He returned to the top division in November 2018 but after winning only one match he withdrew on Day 13 with a left knee injury, sending him back to j≈´ry≈ç. Retirement from sumo He was demoted to the makushita division after the July 2019 tournament, and withdrew on Day 13 in September. He remained in Tokyo for treatment on his knee, missing the Kyushu tournament in November. He fell to makushita 48 in January 2020 and sat out that tournament too, announcing his retirement on Day 13. At his press conference he said he had continuing pain in his knee, and that his fondest career memory was his Day 14 win over Tamaasuka in January 2014, which clinched his first kachi-koshi as a sekitori. His danpatsu-shiki or official retirement ceremony was scheduled be held on May 31, 2020 but was postponed until Feb 23, 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Arawashi does not hold elder stock in the Sumo Association but is working as a coach in an unofficial capacity at Minezaki stable while deciding on his future plans.

Toronto Life 35(5), pp. 104-112. So prominent was magic in young Slaight's life that he toyed with the idea of performing on a permanent basis, and would have done so, Slaight later admitted, had it been profitable. Instead, Slaight, married to his wife Ada Mitchell in 1950 when he was 19 and with three young children to support (Gary b. 1951, Greg b. 1953, Jan Marie b. 1954), combined his entrepreneurial spirit and his showmanship savvy to enter the world of radio. While Slaight focused his talent for showmanship in the realm of broadcasting, magic continues to be ever present in Slaight's life. In an interview with The Globe and Mail in 2005, Slaight proudly showcased his extensive library of magic trick books. The collection numbers in the thousands of volumes and is one of the single largest collections on the craft. Slaight is the author of a number of magic titles including Stewart James in Print: The First Fifty Years (1989), The James File (3 Book Set) (2000), the largest work ever published on magic, let alone on the magic of one man, and Essential Stewart James (2007). Slaight co-hosts an annual magicians conference, 31 Faces North, with performing arts organization Magicana (Artistic Director David Ben) every summer. It is an annual invitation-only event inspired by and meant to resurrect the spirit of collaboration and camaraderie seen in the once-held magicians event (The Ibidem Event) hosted by P.

Slaight's emphasis on talk radio was unlike any other radio station of its time. Slaight insisted that while CHUM would still focus on rock and roll, the station would play music during the day that would appeal to housewives and drivers who found number one station CFRB too bland.

Selkirk once again raised their offer, requested a bid extension, and issued a premature press release that angered Hollinger Argus. After a failed Supreme Court of Ontario bid by Selkirk to extend the bid deadline, the deal with Slaight proceeded.

Although the CRTC approved the purchase, there were two dissenting votes. Both of these commissioners were concerned as to the viability of CFRB because it was an AM Station,\\" Slaight recalled. What emerged from the acquisition was Slaight's promise to increase Standard Broadcasting Corp.'s financial support for the promotion of the Canadian recording industry, and spending $15,000 at CKFM sponsoring Canadian musicians. Despite this, there were concerns among the listening public of the acquisition. Slaight revitalized CFRB by computerizing CFRB's newsroom, introducing phone-in shows, a supper-hour newscast, and more contemporary music that deviated from the older standards, eventually transforming CFRB into an all-talk format. Slaight himself returned to his radio roots and assumed responsibilities of CFRB's programming when his hired man, Peter Shurman, resigned.Mietkiewicz, Henry. 1987. CFRB's Modernizer Quits For Something New. Toronto Star. January 23:D21. The station has been in the top rankings since that time and Slaight paid the $175 million debt off in nine years. Allan Slaight summed up his approach to business after the acquisition: :\\"But the key to success here or at any station is never to be fully satisfied with your sound.

The decision was prompted by a 1987 CRTC ruling in which the CRTC awarded a new TV licence for the Ottawa area. Both CHUM and Baton Broadcasting eagerly entered the bidding race, which encroached on Slaight's own Ottawa-based CJOH franchise.Fraser, Matthew. 2002.

CRTC Ruling Sparks Network War. Globe and Mail. March 3: B1. the CRTC awarded Baton the Ottawa licence. Slaight, angered, appealed to the Federal Cabinet, citing that the \\"decision ha[d] the potential for changing the face of Canadian broadcasting.\\"Fraser, Matthew. 2002. The Connection Between Licenses and Flag Waving. National Post. February 25; Atherton, Tony. 1987. CJOH Appeals Ottawa TV Licence Decision. The Ottawa Citizen. March 27: F12; But instead of opening a competing Ottawa station, Baton approached Slaight and offered to buy CJOH for a premium price of $85 million.Fraser, Matthew. 2002. The Connection Between Licenses and Flag Waving. Slaight accepted, and Baton surrendered its awarded licence to the CRTC, having used the licence acquisition as a bartering chip against Slaight. On April 8, 1988, the CRTC approved the purchase of CJOH by Baton Broadcasting Inc., with the transfer taking place May 5, 1988. In the 1990s, Slaight continued expanding the company's acquisition base, acquiring CFCN-AM, CJAY-FM (from Calgary), CFRN-AM and CJKE-FM (from Edmonton), CKZZ-FM (Vancouver), CISL (Richmond).Canadian Communications Foundation: Radio/Television Station Group History (Standard Broadcasting) , Accessed August 27, 2015. By July 2000, Standard owned 12 stations.Canadian Communications Foundation: Allan Slaight Biography , Accessed August 27, 2015. By early 2001, Standard owned 35 radio stations. In June 2001, Standard Broadcasting acquired 64 radio stations from Quebec's Telemedia Corp., which was owned by the de Gaspe Beaubien family. The station acquisitions included four stations in London, Ontario, three in Hamilton, Ontario and three in St. Catharines, Ontario. Two months later, Standard Broadcasting sold 29 of those stations before receiving regulatory approval for the original Telemedia buy. The acquisition quadrupled Standard's holdings. At that time, Standard's portfolio included radio stations, video distribution and duplication, electronic game distribution, advertising, post- production services in video and audio and retail marketing. While Slaight had handed the reigns of day-to-day operations in 2001 to Dave Coriat, CFO, and son Gary Slaight, CEO, Allan Slaight is quick to point out that his authority still prevails. \\"If I really resist something, it generally doesn't happen,\\" Slaight admitted. Coriat agreed when interviewed, citing Allan Slaight's impeccable timing and business instincts, calling Slaight the \\"ultimate entrepreneur\\" who can quickly calculate potential return and \\"controlled risk- taking.\\" \\"He's not about to blow the money he's worked so hard to earn,\\" Coriat said of Slaight. In 2002, Standard acquired Iceberg Media.com Inc, an internet radio portal providing music for Web sites. The acquisition complemented Standard's existing portfolio as they held a minority interest in Moontaxi (a jazz and classical music online radio service) and MapleCore Ltd. (an e-commerce portal selling concert merchandise and tickets). In 2003, Standard held a 30% interest in Canada's first licensed \\"Urban\\" station, Milestone Radio Inc. and an equivalent interest in Haliburton Broadcasting Group Inc. that consisted of nine Ontario stations, a group of rural Alberta stations and a Calgary-based jazz station, as well as a number of other interests (Sound Source Networks, Video One, Instore Focus Inc, Professional Warehouse Demonstrators, Canada Post Transfer Corporation). In 2004, Standard Radio joined with CBC/Radio and SIRIUS Satellite Radio to bring satellite radio to Canada.Canada News Wire. 2004.

In 2007, Allan Slaight authorized the sale of Standard Radio Inc. to Astral Media Inc. in a $1.08 billion deal. The negotiation saw Slaight taking one-fifth of the purchase price of Astral stock ($880 million cash), giving Slaight a non-voting stake (4.75 million class A non-voting shares) in the company of 8.7 percent.Shecter, Barbara. 2007.

After the sale of Standard Broadcasting, the company, once again became known as Slaight Communications. Legacy After 52 years involved in radio as a broadcaster, News Director, Manager, Merchandising Director, Program and Promotions Manager, Programming Director, Vice President and President and the \\"father of rock radio in Toronto,\\" Allan Slaight stepped down as President and CEO of Standard Broadcasting Corporation, and assumed the position of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Slaight Communications, after having created Canada's largest privately and solely owned multimedia company, with annual revenues exceeding $500,000,000 and the employer of 1,500 full- time employees and 6,000 part-time employees. When asked in an interview what his desired legacy would be, Slaight responded, \\"I would like to have the company regarded as the finest radio group in Canada with the finest executives and the finest staff.\\"  \\"Shotgun\\" Slaight & the Toronto Raptors  Allan Slaight was not just involved in broadcasting. In the early 1990s, he partnered with John Bitove Jr. to launch the Toronto Raptors, one of the first NBA franchises outside of the United States, alongside the Vancouver Grizzlies.NBA.

The Globe and Mail. November 13:C14 Slaight and Bitove eventually disagreed on this very arena, with Slaight calling it \\"financial suicide\\" to build a separate stadium without the Maple Leaf hockey franchise who publicly declared to build their own arena, meaning two rival buildings. The Maple Leafs were willing to share the majority of the cost burden and have the Raptors act as a junior, tenant.Daniels, Craig. 1996. Slaight Makes Pitch for Raptors' Ownership. Financial Post.

November 16:A22. The move was controversial to some, including General Manager Isiah Thomas, who himself had declared interest in gaining majority ownership. Considered by many in the press as a more appropriate owner because of his basketball credentials, Thomas and his backers (David Thomson, son of Lord Kenneth Thomson) failed to meet Slaight's price and conditions for his share of the Raptors, and resigned as general manager.Proudfoot, Jim. 1997.

Philanthropic activities  Slaight has a long history of philanthropic activities in a number of health and arts related realms.

It was the main command and staff body of the Yugoslav Partisans, with Josip Broz Tito at its head. Initially titled Partisan Chief Headquarters when it was created on 27 June 1941, it was renamed at the Stolice conference of 26‚Äì27 September 1941. Its full name became the Supreme Headquarters of the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments. From January 1942, the headquarters became the Supreme Headquarters of the People's Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia to allow for the incorporation of \\"Volunteer Detachments\\" consisting of insurgents that were not willing to formally become Partisans, most of whom were Serb nationalist Chetniks. By November 1942, this experiment had clearly failed, and it was again renamed the Supreme Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia. Finally, on 1 March 1945, it became the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army (renamed Yugoslav People's Army in 1951). The composition of the Supreme Headquarters during the war was successively supplemented, as few members lost their lives.

History of Parliament: Biographies of Members of the Commons House: 1439-1509. HMSO. 1936. Page 982. Google Books. (c. 1405‚Äì1476) was an English judge. He was the elder son of Thomas Yonge (d. 1426), who was Mayor of Bristol in 1411, and Member of Parliament for Bristol in 1413‚Äì14. His younger brother, Sir John Yonge, settled in London, representing the city in parliament and becoming Sheriff in 1455 and Lord Mayor in 1466. Being, like his brother, a strong Yorkist, he was knighted by Edward IV after his restoration to the throne on 20 May 1471.Warkworth, Chron. p. 31 Thomas Yonge received a legal education at the Middle Temple, and from 1439 onwards his name frequently occurs in the year-books. Probably also he was the Thomas Yonge who was counsel for the city of Exeter in 1447.Shillingford, Letters, Camden Soc. pp. 22, 149, 152. On 26 September 1435 he was returned to Parliament for Bristol, being described as a \\"mercator\\" (merchant). He was re-elected for the same constituency on 17 December 1436, 8 January 1441‚Äì2, 31 January 1446‚Äì7, 27 January 1448‚Äì9, 28 October 1449, and 5 October 1450. Bristol was, like most of the trading centres, Yorkist in sympathies, and in June 1451 Yonge distinguished himself by presenting to Parliament a petition from his constituents to the effect that the Duke of York should be recognised heir to the throne. This was part of the attack upon the Duke of Somerset, whose position was, however, unshaken; parliament was dissolved, and Yonge was committed to the Tower. He was released in April 1452, on the general pardon issued after the temporary reconciliation of the two parties. On 7 July 1455 Yonge was once more elected for Bristol, and in January 1456 claimed redress for his arrest and imprisonment, reminding the commons in his petition that all members \\"ought to have their freedom to speak and say in the house of their assembly as to them is thought convenient or reasonable without any manner of challenge, charge, or punition therefore to be laid to them in any wise\\".Rot. Parl. v. 337; Stubbs, Const. Hist. iii. 159, 174, 493; Ramsay, Lancaster and York, ii. 149, 151, 191. The commons sent up the bill to the House of Lords, and the king ordered that the Lords of the Council should provide a remedy; but no further proceedings in the matter are recorded. Yonge was naturally not elected to the Lancastrian parliament which met at Coventry, a curious side-light on the division of parties being afforded by the fact that two \\"generosi de nativitate\\" take the place of the usual \\"mercatores\\" in the representation of Bristol. He was, however, returned for Gloucestershire on 15 September 1460 to the parliament which reversed the proceedings at Coventry. He probably also sat in the parliaments of 1461 and 1462‚Äì3, the returns for which are lost, and the triumph of his party under Edward IV secured Yonge much administrative employment and legal promotion. On 7 November 1463 he was appointed serjeant- at-law, and king's serjeant on the following day, and in November 1467 he was raised to the bench as justice of the common pleas. He was not, however, removed when Henry VI was restored in October 1470, but lost his position during the puzzling rearrangement of the judiciary, when Edward IV regained his throne six months later, though he was exempted from the operation of the Act of Resumption in 1472‚Äì3. On 29 October 1475, in spite of his advanced age, he was appointed a justice of the King's Bench. He died in the following year, and was buried in Christ Church, London. John Yonge (1467?‚Äì1516), the Master of the Rolls, is doubtfully said to have been his son, and Walter Yonge the diarist to have been descended from him.Burke, Extinct Baronetcies; but cf.

It is native to India and has been introduced into Burma. A small to medium-sized tree with a pale-coloured trunk, it is commonly known as the ‡§≠‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ in Marathi (meaning ghost tree), kulu, Indian tragacanth, gum karaya, katira, sterculia gum or kateera gum. The specific name urens refers to the stinging hairs present on the flowers.  Subspecies  Sterculia urens var. thorelii (Pierre) C.

Description The gum karaya is a medium-sized deciduous tree with horizontally-spreading branches, growing to a maximum height of about . The bark is smooth, fibrous and thick, greenish-grey, with the surface layer peeling off in large flakes. The twigs are hairy at first. The leaves are alternate, simple, hairy beneath and have three to five palmate lobes. They are clustered at the tips of the twigs. ;Flowers Inflorescence The flowers are yellowish-green and produced in panicles in the axils of the leaves. They are polygamous (having male, female and bisexual flowers on the same tree) and are clad in sticky or glandular short hairs. The calyx has five lobes and there are no petals. Male flowers have a columnar boss of ten stamens while bisexual flowers have a ring of anthers round the five free, radiating carpels which grow to when fully developed. They are pinkish and densely covered with red hairs, including stinging hairs.

This valuable substance is traditionally tapped by cutting or peeling back the bark, or by making deep gashes at the base of the trunk with an axe. Such crude methods of extraction often kill the tree, but it has been found that application of the plant growth regulator ethephon stimulates the production of gum, and when used in carefully controlled amounts, increases gum yield and enhances healing of the wounds. Karaya gum swells when it absorbs water and is used as a laxative because adds bulk to the contents of the intestine, stimulating the gut to expel waste material. Karaya gum is also reputed to have aphrodisiacal properties, but there is insufficient evidence to support this. Other uses for the gum are as a thickener in cosmetics and medications, and as an adhesive for dentures. In manufacturing, it is added as a binder, emulsifier and stabiliser in the preparation of beverages and foods. The seeds are roasted and eaten.

It was composed either in 1975 or 1976. A second version for modern instruments was made in 1988. History Pour que les fruits m√ªrissent cet √©t√© was written for the seven musicians of the Florilegium Musicum of Paris (Jean-Claude Malgoire, Jean-Claude Veilhan, Jean-Marie Nicolas, Fran√ßoise Bloch, Monique Bouret, Jacques Prat, and Jacques Bidart), each of whom is capable of performing on a number of different instruments. Goeyvaerts chose fourteen instruments for his composition: positive organ, lute, soprano shawm, bombarde (tenor shawm), two crumhorns, hautbois de Poitou, rackett, two recorders, discant fiddle, viola da gamba, baroque violin, and rebec (; ). The year of composition is given variously as 1975 (; ) and 1976 (; ). In 1988, Goeyvaerts made a new version under the Dutch translation of the title, Voor het rijpen van de zomervruchten, for a chamber ensemble of eleven instruments (flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, harp, violin, viola, and cello) . Analysis In 1975, Goeyvaerts began working with a personal interpretation of minimalism. Pour que les fruits is one of the earliest pieces composed in this new style, which the composer described as \\"evolving repetitive technique\\". A rhythmic cell within a fixed time-span is repeated and a new element added with every repetition. Once the cell is complete, it starts gradually to disintegrate . Goeyvaerts's minimalism of the later 1970s and 1980s, like that of most other European minimalists, uses a fully chromatic language, but Pour que les fruits is, like most American minimalism, diatonic. Goeyvaerts's choice in this case is undoubtedly conditioned by the instruments, which were designed to produce diatonic scales. A chromatic tonal language is consequently against their nature . Although the work presents itself as a continuous process, all in a unifying tempo of = 120 and constant 3/4 meter, it nevertheless is divided into five large sections, seamlessly connected without any breaks, but marked in the score as sections A through E .

Early life and education Rashid was born in Tinsukia, Assam in British India on 28 December 1939. On the eve of the Second World War, his father late Rahimuddin Ahmed, an employee of the Assam Bengal Railway was transferred to Chittagong. He spent his early childhood in the idyllic environment of the Pahartali and Chittagong hills. When the Japanese bombed Chittagong, his father sent them to his village home in Nabinagar, Brahmanbaria. His village home at Meratali stands on the river Titas and his stay in pastoral surrounding nourished his sensibilities. His early education started with his mother, Salema Khatoon, who was the only literate woman in the village. Later a Maulana was hired for the village boys and he always remembers him with profound love and respect. His family moved to Pahartali and he read in the Pahartali Railway High School in 1947. Next year the family moved to Chittagong and he got himself admitted to Chittagong Collegiate School. Here he read up to class nine and on his father's retirement moved to Brahmanbaria town. He passed his matriculation examination from Annada Model High School in 1955. He got himself admitted to Brahmanbaria College, and passed his Intermediate in Arts examination (1957) under Dhaka University standing 5th in the merit list. He did his BA honours (1960) and MA (1961) from Dhaka University. He later went to University of Cambridge (Fitzwilliam College), UK and obtained his B A honours (1966) and M A (1970). In the mid- seventies he went to the East West Centre, Hawaii and did his ESOL training which included a visit to the mainland to see some of the important language schools in the States. Professional career He started his teaching career as a lecturer at Brahmanbaria College in late 1961. He joined EPJES on 4 February 1962 and started teaching at Islamic Intermediate College (now Kavi Nazrul College). He obtained a government scholarship and proceeded to Cambridge for higher studies. He did his Tripos in English and obtained a B A with honours in 1966. On his return, he was appointed a lecturer at Dhaka College. He was promoted to assistant professor on 6 May 1968. He joined Jinnah College (now Titumir College) and taught there until his selection as a member of the East Pakistan Senior Education Service. He joined M C College, Sylhet as an associate professor on 3 July 1972. He then resigned his government service and joined Chittagong University as an associate professor on 2 October 1973. He was made a professor of English on 24 July 1981. He taught at the University of Anaba, Algeria between 1979 and 1980. He resigned his job at the Chittagong University on 14 May 1985 and joined Jahangirnagar University, on the following day. During the interregnum of Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed he was appointed Director General of Bangla Academy on 7 February 1991. After a stint of four years he went back to Jahangirnagar University. He went on voluntary retirement in 1998. He took a break from teaching and became the chief editor of Dhaka Courier, a national English- language newsweekly. But his journalistic career was short-lived and he joined North South University as an adjunct professor of English. He taught there for 8 years and terminated his contract in December 2008. He then joined Darul Ihsan University as an adviser and professor of English. He taught at International Islamic University Chittagong at its Dhaka branch until 28 February 2015.

He has no children by her. Bangla Academy His appointment as the director general of the Bangla Academy is a landmark in his career as an educational administrator. This was a challenge which he took with great zeal. At the universities he proved his merit as the provosts of A F Rahman Hall, CU (1980-1982), Shahjalal Hall CU (1983-1985) and M H Hall, JU (1990-1991). But Bangla Academy was a vast field for creative activities of national interest. He insisted on its research activities ‚Äì chiefly the dictionaries which needed editing and branding. He published the Bangla Academy English‚ÄìBengali Dictionary (ed Z R Siddiqui) and devised such marketing policies as made it an instant best seller. The cover design was made by artist and painter Qayyum Chowdhury and all the dictionaries had the same design with change of colour. He commissioned three dictionaries during his tenure and published them. He himself edited one pocket dictionary. The other thing he emphasized was the publication of complete works of literary celebrities including Dr Muhammad Shahidullah, Kaykobad, Farrukh Ahmed and most importantly the complete works of Kazi Nazrul Islam,. During his time, Ananda literary Award was given to Bangla Academy which the Council of the Academy politely refused. The Bangla Academy Press bought two brand new Heidelberg Printing machines and it was during his tenure that the Press employees came under govt. pension scheme. A new project for young writers ‚ÄòTarun Lekhak Prakalpo‚Äô was started during his tenure. President of autonomous bodies and NGO He was elected the president of World University Service International, Geneva in 1984 at the General Assembly held in Nantes, France.

He led the delegation of the WUS to the 42nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. He was elected president of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh in 1998 for two years.

Between 2006 and 2014, the band released 6 full-length albums. History The band's founding members, Richard Edwards and Andy Fry, met while teens. Eventually, in 2004, the two formed Margot & the Nuclear So and So's, named after the character Margot in Wes Anderson's 2001 film The Royal Tenenbaums. Over time, many friends of Edwards and Fry in the Indianapolis area joined the band. By the time their first album The Dust of Retreat was released in 2006, the band contained eight full-time members. After a move to Chicago in 2009, Edwards began to experiment with a new band lineup, and eventually decided on a six-man group made up of some former members and some Chicago-area musicians. This new lineup allowed Edwards to take the band in a more rock-based direction, which could be seen in their next two studio albums Buzzard (2010), and Rot Gut, Domestic (2012). In an interview with blogger Adam Vitcavage, Edwards discussed his battle with Clostridium difficile colitis as well as the future of the band. Edwards proclaimed, \\"I've threatened to break up this stupid band so many times, I don't want to continue crying wolf. That said, I don't currently see any real reason for Margot to continue.\\" Releases The band's first full album, The Dust of Retreat, was released in 2005 through Standard Recording Company. It was remastered and re-released on March 26, 2006 by Artemis Records. The style was described by MacKenzie Wilson as \\"cinematic chamber pop\\" that \\"both the casual music fan and music perfectionist will enjoy\\". Two full lengths were released on October 7, 2008, Animal! and Not Animal. All releases were by Epic Records. Four intimate live recordings of songs, two of which are exclusive to Animal!, were available for free download on the website Daytrotter. There were delays in the release of the band's second full length due to disagreements between the band and Epic Records regarding the song selection of the album. Animal! is Margot's preferred version of the album, while Not Animal is Epic Records's. Five songs appear on both releases, out of the 12 tracks on each album. On their MySpace page, the band said they would like fans to listen to Animal! first. The band was a featured musical guest on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in November 2008. They played their new song \\"As Tall As Cliffs\\", one of the songs on both records. The band released their third album, Buzzard, on September 21, 2010, via Mariel Recordings, their own label with distribution through Redeye. The album features many Chicago musicians and friends of the band, including Tim Rutili, Joe Adamik, Cameron McGill, Katie Todd, Brian Deck, and Ronnie Kwasman. Their fourth album, Rot Gut, Domestic, produced by John Congleton, was released early to pledges for digital download via PledgeMusic on March 12, 2012. The CD and vinyl versions were released nationally on March 20, 2012. Margot's fifth album, Sling Shot to Heaven was released on April 22, 2014 through the Mariel Records. Also released with this was a movie shot on 16 mm film entitled Tell Me More About Evil: A Film about Margot & the Nuclear So and So's. This film included stripped down versions of many album tracks and also included some voice narration. On November 4, 2014, the soundtrack to the film was released as a digital download, on vinyl, and on cassette tape. Richard Edwards worked on compiling a rarities box set that encompassed all of their studio albums. In 2015, the band released The Bride On The Boxcar ‚Äì A Decade of Margot Rarities: 2004‚Äì2014, through Joyful Noise Recordings. is broken up into five different eras on different albums. The five parts of the set are: \\"Hybristophilia\\", \\"PANIC ATTACKS (Low Level Bummer)\\", \\"Now, Let's Risk Our Feathers\\", \\"Dark Energy in the Spotlight\\", and \\"You Look Like the Future, Baby\\". Each disc represents an era in the band. It was released on vinyl and digital download. On January 24, 2017, Edwards officially announced the release date of his first solo album, Lemon Cotton Candy Sunset. The album was released on March 31, 2017 via Joyful Noise Recordings. The first single, \\"Disappeared Planets\\", was made available to stream on the album's website. Discography ;Studio albums * The Dust of Retreat (2006) * Animal!

It is developed by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and uses Intel RealSense Technology in order to enhance the immersive nature of player interaction. The educational game aims to teach players about world geography and culture to its 10‚Äì14 year old target market. A different game was released on the iOS platform under the same name. This game marks the franchise's debut onto the smartphone market, and has a target market of people aged 9‚Äì11. Gameplay Players have to travel across the globe, uncovering clues to work out where crooks are hiding. In each location, the player hunts for clues using their naked eye, an x-ray, and ultraviolet light, similar to a hidden object game. Players undertake a street racing minigame when chasing down the crook. Each case has a time limit, with hours being used whenever the player goes to a new country. They can use coins to speed up this travel time. The game comes with an encyclopedia to help players who cannot decrypt a clue. Intel RealSense Technology allows players to use gesture control to do things like pick up clues and fly a plane. The use of puns, which is a staple of the series, is continued here, with names of crooks including \\"Hal Apenyo\\" and \\"Bea Carefull\\". The free version of the game contains Pack 1: Museum Heist! (5 missions), while Pack 1: Museum Heist! (5 missions) and Pack 2: Monumental Emergencies! (10 missions) can be purchased together. In the iOS version, each level sees the player start a case, travel the world, collect clues, fill out a warrant, and finally chase the crook. Players can track their progress on the leaderboard via the Apple Game Centre. In this version, players have two travel options: normal, and express, the latter of which takes up in-game currency. In each location players search for clues via their fingers' manipulation of the touch pad, and as witnesses offer them information, they can start to build up their warrant. Development The first hint of the new game was made on 22 January 2015 via a teaser trailer released on Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's YouTube channel entitled ACME Alert: Carmen Sandiego‚Ñ¢ is back with a new game!. It said the game would be \\"available soon for free download on Amazon.com\\". A few months later in March 2015, Edutainment Weekly quoted Houghton Mifflin Harcourt communications director Jennifer Berlin as saying that there would be future developments regarding an iOS app. Further details were peppered throughout press releases leading up to the game's official launch date: Carmen Sandiego Returns was advertised as being a bilingual game in English/French, and was noteworthy for offering the company \\"an opportunity to leverage legacy assets with a strong brand and fan base\\". On May 14, 2015, the game became available on Amazon, while in November, the app version was released to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original Carmen Sandiego game. EdSurge noted that \\"her re- emergence coincides with a resurgence in the popularity of educational games\\", which had been in decline since the turn of the millennium. Reception Much of the discussion about Carmen Sandiego Returns was in a new release that hearkened back to the first games in the franchise's thirty-year history. The Telegraph praised the game's educational content and \\"stellar graphics\\", noting it \\"has all the things 90's kids loved about the original character\\". According to GeekDad, the game \\" bring[s] the character back to life\\". The Livingston Post wrote that the game \\"revives the story and play of the Carmen Sandiego brand\\". MACNN said that \\"the voice acting is wonderful and the music and sounds have a cool edutainment circa '95 vibe.\\" AppAddict praised the game's ability to retain its old gameplay while using new technology to enhance the experience, writing \\"Carmen Sandiego Returns is an excellent, modern addition to this beloved franchise from my childhood\\". AppleGazette had a very positive reaction to the game, concluding \\"Who wouldn‚Äôt want this app? Seriously,\\" after listing the game's nostalgic summary. Slashgear noted that in an attempt to appeal to the next generation of gamers who may be unfamiliar with Carmen Sandiego, HMH decided to release the game onto the platform they prefer, iOS. There were some negative reactions to the gameplay. Apple N Apps gave it a 2 out of 5, writing that its nostalgia is ultimately outweighed by its simplicity, blandness, and shortness, concluding that despite a \\"promising pedigree\\" it had a \\"poor execution\\". MakeUseOf disliked the price point for each set of three 15-minute cases, commenting that a more cost-effective way to experience the franchise would be to download the free DOS versions of the 80's games. Meanwhile, TouchVision was generally ambivalent toward both the PC and iOS versions of the game. TouchVision criticised the PC version for requiring the player to purchase Intel RealSense, and the app version for only having three short missions for free before the player has to pay for more.

There were printers in many of the towns, and some towns had many printers. The laws of Charles V required all printers and booksellers to acquire a license in order to exercise their trade, a requirement that was in place through the subsequent period of Spanish rule. His son, Philip II of Spain, further ordered that the Antwerp printers enrol with the Guild of St Luke, adding another layer of control. The business records of one of the most important printing houses of the era, the Plantin Office in Antwerp, have remained intact, and are now the archive of the Plantin-Moretus Museum. As a result, the records of who was involved in printing are extremely accessible to historians and have been much studied. This list is arranged alphabetically by town. Booksellers or print publishers who did not own a printing press but who commissioned printing under their own name are included. Some of the dates given are approximate. As of January 2015 the list is largely limited to printers who were active at some point during the rule of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella (1598‚Äì1621).

China: A History, Vol. 2: \\"From the Great Qing Empire through the People's Republic of China\\", p. 146, n. 33\\\\. Hackett (Indianapolis), 2010. . Narrative The film begins with the carnage left by Japanese bombing in northeastern China, describing it as an unprovoked act of aggression. It then provides a brief overview of Chinese history and its connections and importance to Europe and North America. It discusses the modernization undertaken by the Republic and suggests that nascent development provoked Japan's attack. Japan's history of aggression is detailed, with United States's continuing exports of iron and steel to the country pointedly noted. The film takes pains to present the Chinese factions as united against the invaders and ends with some small Chinese victories to suggest a turning tide of battle, especially praising the 8th Route Army. Legacy Footage from the film was later incorporated into Frank Capra's American propaganda film The Battle of China, which also made prominent use of \\"The March of the Volunteers\\", the song which later became the Chinese National Anthem. The camera from the film was donated by Ivens to the Chinese Communist Party, which used it to begin the Yan'an Film Group.

On May 30, 1979 a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operating the flight crashed during a nonprecision approach to Rockland's Knox County Regional Airport. All but one of the 18 people on board were killed. The cause of the accident was controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) after the failure of the flightcrew to stop the aircraft's descent below the minimum descent altitude for the nonprecision approach at Knox County airport. The investigation into the accident looked into the airline's corporate culture as a contributing factor to the crash; this was the first time an investigation took this approach to an air crash. The crash of Flight 46 is currently the deadliest to have occurred in the state of Maine. At the time of the crash, the crew had descended the Twin Otter below the minimum descent altitude in order to see the runway in heavy fog. Airport and weather There was poor visibility around Rockland on the night of the crash. Fog was extremely common at Knox County Regional Airport because of its position on a peninsula in Penobscot Bay. The weather observer at the airport used markers to the north and west of the airport to determine visibility, but approaches were from the south to the airport's Runway 3. The approach path was over the Atlantic Ocean, and fog is often thicker over the sea than over land. =Approach= At the time, Runway 3 had a set of flashing strobe lights leading to the runway, which could be activated by either the flight crew or the company agent stationed at the airport. Downeast Airlines management The airline was established by Robert Stenger in the 1960s. Originally, Stenger flew, refueled and loaded passenger luggage onto the aircraft, and his wife would sell tickets. As the airline grew, he hired more pilots and acquired more equipment, but found himself ill-prepared to manage staff. In addition, the airline had trouble recruiting pilots with experience of flying in the bad weather frequently found in Maine. Retired Rockland Police Chief Alfred Ockenfels, who flew for Downeast, said, \\"Stenger was a guy that didn‚Äôt suffer fools gladly; he barked at you...but he never told anyone to go below the [altitude] minimums.\\" Some pilots for the airline felt that Stenger took any delay or problem as a personal attack, or an attack against the company. Around the time of the crash, several senior pilots had left the company due to Stenger's management style. =Pilot training= Although the Company operations manual expressed the need for coordination between the Captain and First Officer during flight, duties were not clearly distributed between the pilot in command and first officer. Pilots for the airline received minimal training, and some deadhead flights marked as training time did not actually include any training. Aircraft operation and maintenance The aircraft involved in the crash pictured in 1973, then operated by Air Illinois The aircraft involved in the accident, a twin-engine turboprop, was known to have a right engine that ran hotter and used more fuel in flight than the left engine. In addition to the high fuel flow and oil temperature in the right engine, the aircraft had poor cockpit lighting at night. Observation flights by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found that errors in flap settings due to poor lighting were common on Twin Otters during night flights. The area around the flap control overhead was not illuminated; and the flap position indicator on the windscreen center post was poorly illuminated to the point of being barely visible. Some of the lights in the engine gauges had been incorrectly replaced with red, instead of white bulbs, making the gauges hard to see. Pilots had requested the maintenance crew standardize on one color of light bulb, but this had not been done at the time of the accident. Among Downeast pilots, there was discussion of the first officer's altimeter sticking and indicating as much as a 100 ft (30m) difference in altitude compared to the pilot's altimeter during descent and ascent. There was no formal record of the altimeter problem in the aircraft's logbooks, but investigators were told that it had been checked during an inspection in the past with no defects found. =Crew= At the time of the crash, the captain, James Merryman, was the chief pilot of the airline and was responsible for recruiting, selecting and training new pilots for the airline. He had 17 years experience as a pilot, but less than a year's experience as a chief pilot. His friends and family told investigators that in the weeks before the crash, he was exhibiting symptoms of extreme stress. The First Officer, George Hines, had been with the airline for two months and had only flown single-engine aircraft before joining Downeast. He was reported to have had problems with instrument approaches in the past, including excessive rates of descent. Examination of the crew members' bodies after the crash determined that the First Officer was likely flying at the time of the crash, as he had suffered a broken thumb.  Sole survivor  Of the 16 passengers and 2 aircrew aboard the flight, all but one perished in the crash. 16-year-old John McCafferty was returning from Florida and had his parents waiting for him at the Owls Head Airport. Seated in the rear of the plane, McCafferty briefly saw trees through the fog just before the crash. After impact he was able to crawl from the wreckage with a broken arm and leg. He also had his scalp torn from his forehead. Thirty years later McCafferty still had nightmares relating it to post-traumatic stress. \\"Nobody wanted that crash to happen. It‚Äôs unfortunate that it did. It changed the lives of a lot of people,\\" he said. \\"It‚Äôs an awful feeling. I sometimes feel that I‚Äôm being haunted. Like there are people around me sometimes that I don‚Äôt see. There is a God, I can tell you that.\\" On May 30, 2019, the fortieth anniversary of the crash, McCafferty spoke to the media for the first time. In media The crash was featured on an episode of the American television program Why Planes Crash, broadcast on The Weather Channel.

Description Scarabaeus puncticollis has a distinctive set of points (hence the Latin species name puncticollis) along the basal margin of the pronotum. The head has a characteristic array of six projections, resembling rays. These projections are similar to four more projections on each of the tibiae of the front legs. All these projections are adaptations for digging and for forming balls of dung. The mid- and hind-legs have normal, well-developed 5-segmented tarsi. These beetles feed exclusively on dung.Entomologi italiani Distribution This species is present in Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Portugal, Spain and North Africa. Bibliography *Motschulsky V.

La Place was considered a skilled missionary, described by contemporaries as a \\"very conscientious man, who only concerns himself with the affairs of his mission\\"Monsieur Tiblerge, writing in a 1695 memoir at Fort Nashwaak, quoted in Raymond p.10. and as a man who \\"might be relied on, he being a very honest man\\".Monsieu Champigney, Intendant at Quebec, writing in letter to the French government in October 1695, from Raymond p.10. He is frequently mentioned in the writings of John Gyles in favourable terms. Gyles, who had been captured by the Maliseet and credited La Place with convincing his captors to keep him alive, described La Place as \\"a gentleman of a humane, generous disposition\\".John Gyles, quoted in Raymond, p.10. Role in King William's War After initially having little to do with the events of the King William's War, La Place began to take an active role in 1696, coordinating the movements of Maliseet warriors.Binasco op. cit., p.98. During the same year he took part in the French-led expedition against English forces at Pemaquid as chaplain to 150 Maliseet fighters, leading a group of 50 warriors during the successful capture of the English fort. After the battle he travelled to Fort Nashwaak, the capital of Acadia. After learning of an English-led expedition to besiege Fort Nashwaak, Governor Villebon sent La Place to gather Maliseet fighters to help defend the fort. After between 30 and 36 fighters were led to Nashwaak, La Place was at the fort during the Siege of Fort Nashwaak in October and then spent the winter of 1696‚Äì97 as acting chaplain at the capital before accompanying a raiding party of First Nations fighters against English settlements in New England.Binasco, op. cit., p.99.Raymond, op. cit., p.26.

He is most known for his bronze sculptures. Most of his artwork deals with the ideas of freedom, oppression, genocide and suffering. In 1971, he was commissioned to make a statue of Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah. He is most known for his Box series, Sabra and Chantila, Hunger and Mother. Mohammad's work was presented at the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013, which was the first time Kuwait participated in the event. He has written a book about his work and career, entitled The Art of Sami Mohammad, which was published in 1995.  Early life and education  Mohammad was born in Kuwait on October 1, 1943. His father was a tailor. As a child, he liked playing with clay and made forms that looked like birds and animals and sold them to his friends. When he was a student at Sabaah School, he helped in creating statues for a school project for commemorating the battle of Port Said and Port Fouad. At the inauguration of the display, he was awarded first prize by Sheikh Abdullah Al Jaber Al Sabah, the General Director of education department. When Mohammad was of 20 years, he left the school to start working at the Ministry of Interior. At the same time, The Free Atelier was formed, that provided art material and tutoring free of charge to the students. The Ministry of Education, which officially administers the Atelier as one of its institutional units, granted him a lifelong stipend. As a stipendiary he acquired studio space at The Free Atelier. He joined the Atelier and went to the Atelier regularly. During those years, he read avidly about the works of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which influenced the early works in his career. In 1966, he received a government scholarship to Egypt to study at the Institute of Fine Arts in Cairo, a college of fine arts and completed his degree in 1970. In 1967, he co-founded the Kuwaiti Society of Formative Artists. In 1973, Mohammad got a scholarship for a course of study in the USA to study at the College of Fine Arts in San Francisco. He spent his first year at the Vermont college to improve his English language. Following the course at Vermont, instead of joining College of Fine Arts, he went to Jonhson Institute for artists in Princeton. It was at this institute that he started working with bronze casting and other mediums and techniques.  Career  Before leaving for the USA to study further, The Kuwaiti University deputized him as a visiting artist to teach tutorials in visual arts. While Mohammad was in the USA, he start working on his first major collection called Curves. After completing his education, he returned to Kuwait in 1976. On his return, he started working on Before birth, \\"After birth\\" and \\"Motherhood\\". In 1978, he was selected to represent Kuwait at the Kuwaiti Artists Exhibition in Paris and later represented Kuwait at the Tenth International Sculpture conference held in Toronto. Upon returning from the conference, he began work on his Box series and subsequently started focusing on mankind and humans as the subject of his sculptures and arts. He held his first travelling exhibition in 1994, which included both paintings and sculptures. The exhibition opened in Sharjah, organized by Department of Culture and Information, Directorate of Arts, then moved to Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Italy and participated in Bodova International Biennial on sculpture. Mohammad closed his studio at The Free Atelier in 1999. The National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters commissioned him to design the State of Kuwait Merit Award Trophy and was later commissioned to design and execute the golden medal and trophy of The National Achievement Award. In the early 2000s, The Museum of Contemporary Art in Sharjah dedicated a separate wing for his artworks which are exhibited on long-term basis. Mohammad's work was presented at 55th Venice Biennale in 2013, the first time that Kuwait participated in the event. Titled \\"National Works\\" and curated by Ala Younis, the pavilion's show featured a bronze bust of Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, a fiberglass copy of the extended arm of Sheikh Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah (1989), in addition to series of drawings and photographs excavated from the Mohammad's studio. Both works were references produced for unique pieces produced by the artist in previous commissions in 1971 and 1988 respectively.  Works  The subject of most of Mohammad's work has been human and Arab revolution. In the beginning of his career, he was involved in making life-size sculptures. Some of the important ones included Ibn Rushd (1964) and Al-Khalil Bin Ahmad (1965). Mohammad often made sculptures that were related to the crisis of the time. In 1983, he made Sabra and Shatila, expressing the pain of Sabra and Shatila massacre and before that he made sculptures relating to the Crisis in the Cairo in 1970's. He started working on Boxes series, in 1979, which became one of his major works. Other important works by him included the Shackled series, which were paintings and drawings in Chinese ink on paper and the Call for Help series, The Sailor (1964) and Mother (1968). After returning from the US, his art changed considerably, having been influenced by the Western artist. Upon returning from the US, he started studying other artists' work and sought to find new ways of expression. = Sabra and Shatila = Sabra and Shatila is a sculpture made by Mohammad in 1983 after the Sabra and Shatila massacres. It was the subject of a paper written by Zahra Hussein in 2010. The sculpture shows a man on a block who is blindfolded and appears to be writhing in pain. Hussein wrote in her paper that \\"his form is simple yet highly polysemous. In Sabra and Shatila, the barely alive single, recumbent body bound by incising, torturous fetters stands for a people. Mohammad's Sabra and Shatila does what the media images and abstract art regularly decline to do. It Solemnizes its narrative dimension, merges the secular and the sacred and engages in the critique of Political Darwinism.\\" = Statue of Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah = Mohammad was commissioned by Al-Aam Newspaper in 1971 to make a statue of Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, who was the ruler of Kuwait from 1950 to 1965. The statues was made of Bronze and completed in 1972. While discussing, Mohammad's work, Arab Times wrote that \\"the pose the artist chose for his creation and the expression on the face of the Amir reveals the noble bearing of the man he was...\\" and called it \\"one of the most important works\\" by Mohammad. Later, Mohammad also made the statue of Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah. Both these statues were presented at 55th Venice Biennale. = Hunger = In 1970, Mohmmad made Hunger, which is a sculpture that shows a mother and a child, all skin and bones. The sculpture was modelled of synthetic marble. It was called the \\"true epitome of hunger and starving humanity\\" by the Arab Times. Paralysis and Resistance.jpgParalysis and Resistance (1980) The Penetration.jpgThe Penetration (1989)  Artistry and style  The subject of majority of work by Mohammad has been humans and the Arab revolution. The topics for his sculptures surround the ideas of oppression, genocide and suffering. He has made many sculptures that were about the tragedies of his time: the tragedy of Sabra and Chatila, political oppression, economic difficulties and human aggressiveness. An article published in Al-Watan in 1985 wrote than \\"Sami has always been faithful to the subjects of his sculpting: humanity and the Arab revolutionary. In this, he is considered a follower of Iraqi school of art sculpture. However, in his style, he belongs to the gulf school. Nevertheless, he has maintained his own steady and prevailing style.\\" His art has been influenced by the Arab awakening of the 70's and the liberalism that came about subsequently. A paper analysing, the work of Mohammad wrote that \\"in his early career, Mohammad enjoyed the benefits of the Arab awakenings liberalism and sculpted life size male and female figures in nude, seminude categories. Later, in his mature years, he witnessed the dwindling support for art when less liberal ideologies ascended politically and the exuberant culture climate, brought about by the ideals of Arab awakening and Arab nationals, waned.\\" After returning from the US, his art changed considerably, having been influenced by the Western artist. Upon returning from the US, he started studying other artists' work and sought to find new ways of expression. Freedom is yet another important concept in the art of Mohammad. A paper about his art discussed that \\"...his visual art suggests that the sign of the buoyancy of culture is the conviction that the underpinning logos should be freedom‚Äìand most specifically, free speech...\\"  Publications  In 1995, Mohammad published his first and only book, The Art of Sami Mohammad, a bilingual Arabic-English book which traces the development of his career. Mohammad has also been the subject of multiple publications. In 2004, Sami Mohammad and the Semiotics of Abstraction was published that discussed his artwork and style in great detail. In 2010, a paper entitled Aesthetics of Memorialization: The Sabra and Shatila Genocide in the Work of Sami Mohammad, Jean Genet, And June Jordan discussed his Sabra and Shatila. His work was the subject of The Prometheus Myth in the Sculptures of Sami Mohammad and the Plays of Aeschylus and Shelley, a paper published in 2012, that explored semiosis in four of his works Paralysis and Resistance (1980), The Challenge (1983), The Tied Man (1989), and The Earthquake (1990). He was interviewed by Selections Magazine and was published in their Winter 2018 issues titled \\"Sanctuaries\\". In this, he talks about his studio and artist life along with his influences.  Reception  Mohammad's work has received critical acclaim in Kuwait as well as internationally. His work has received considerable media attention. In a series of articles about Mohammad's life, the Arab Times wrote that \\"Sami is an artist deeply involved in the human saga. Everything that spells tragedy and suffering interests him.\\" In September 1987, the Al-Arabi Magazine while reviewing his work wrote that, \\"one of the most important elements that gave the formative works of Sami Mohammad a considerable degree of steadiness and strength is his full commitment to the creation of visual and intellectual connection between one artistic step and other.\\" Mohammad has often been called one of the most important artists in Kuwait. The Al-Quds Al-Arabi called him \\"the most prominent aspect in formative art in Kuwait and the Arab world.\\" The Kul al- Arab called his work \\"noisily eloquent\\" and \\"his sculptures are the result of a deep understanding of the feeling and suffering of the viewer\\". Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, has said \\"his works are worthy of being displayed in the lobbies and corridors of the United Nations Building in New York and of the UNESCO in Paris.\\"  Selected awards and honors  *1984 ‚Äì First prize in First Cairo Art Biennial *1988 ‚Äì First prize at the Kuwait General Exhibition *1988 ‚Äì First prize at the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) Art Biennial *State of Kuwait National Merit Award, given by the National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters  References   External links  *Official Website Category:Living people Category:Kuwaiti sculptors Category:1943 births Category:Kuwaiti contemporary artists Category:Male sculptors Category:20th- century sculptors Category:21st-century sculptors ","title":"Sami Mohammad"},{"id":"45194497","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1953 in Laos.

It is listed as number 33 in the early 19th-century Henry Thomas Colebrooke anthology.Paul Deussen (Translator), Sixty Upanisads of the Veda, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 558‚Äì565 It is written in Sanskrit language, attached to the Krishna (Black) Yajurveda, is one of 14 Vaishnava Upanishads, and it recommends the bhakti of Lord Narayana (Vishnu). The Upanishad is, states Paul Deussen, among those that can be described as \\"cult of formula\\", where meditation shifts from objects and philosophy to that of a specific formula. The Narayana Upanishad posits the formula, \\"Aum Namo Narayanaya\\", a mantra as a means of reaching salvation, which is communion with Vishnu. The text is classified as one of the Mantra Upanishads.K. Narayanasvami Aiyar, Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, , pp. viii, 128‚Äì129 The Narayana Upanishad asserts that \\"all gods, all Rishis and all beings are born from Narayana, and merge into Narayana\\". The text, suggests Deussen, is probably compiled from passages from different era and texts.Paul Deussen (Translator), Sixty Upanisads of the Veda, Vol. 2, Motilal Banarsidass, (2010 Reprint), pp. 803‚Äì805 Contents The Upanishad is short, and has five chapters. =Chapter 1: Everything was born in Narayana, everything ends in Narayana= The Upanishad asserts in Chapter 1 that Narayana created the Prana (life essence, breath), the senses, and the mind (Chit and the consciousness). He created the elements of the universe, namely the wind (Vayu), the light (Jyoti), the water (Ap), the fire (Agni), the ether (Kha) and the Prithvi (earth).‡•• ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§£‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ç ‡•• Sanskrit text of Narayana Upanishad, SanskritDocuments Archives (2009), Quote: ‡§ñ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ‡§™‡§É ‡§™‡•É‡§•‡§ø‡§µ‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§£‡•Ä ‡•§ From him was born Brahman, Rudra, Prajapati, the twelve Adityas, Indra, the eight Vasus, the meters of verses, all Rishis, and all beings. Everyone is born from Narayana, and ultimately merges back into Narayana. =Chapter 2: Narayana is one god= Chapter 2 declares that Narayana is one without a second, eternal god, same as Brahman, Shiva, Sakra, time, the corporal, the uncorporal, the inner, the outer, this whole universe, what was, what is to be. =Chapter 3, 4 and 5: Narayana Mantra= Chapters 3 and 4 state that studying the Narayana Upanishad is the path to fearless life, achieving immortality, entering Brahmanhood. The mantra to study, states the text, is \\"Aum Namo Narayanaya\\", which is of 1-2-5 syllable construct, which when studied delivers one a long life and all material and non-material desires. Chapter 5 states that the one who worships with the formula, \\"Aum Namo Narayanaya\\", goes to Vishnu's heaven, becomes free from birth and samsara.

It was included in the collection of stories by Jack London The Strength of the Strong, published by Macmillan in 1914.The Strength of the Strong The World of Jack London, accessed 21 January 2015. London was interested in socialism, and this story relates to organized labor. It is one of his stories that could now be regarded as science fiction: set in the near future, the story imagines calamitous consequences of a general strike in the USA. Plot summary The narrator, Corf, is a wealthy resident of San Francisco, with several servants. In his student days he wrote an article \\"The Dream of Debs\\", about Eugene V. Debs's idea to have a general strike, years before; now he is experiencing the reality. It is enjoyable at first, \\"a sort of placid adventure\\". At his club there is a discussion about how the situation arose: the American Federation of Labor collapsed and its place was taken by the (fictitious) ILW (which has called the strike) because, according to one member, organized labor was unfairly treated by employers: \\"'You smashed all the old federations and drove labor into the ILW.'\\" For several days it remains peaceful; there is shortage of some provisions, and there are fewer cars, since they cannot be repaired. Later, the shortage of food becomes serious; law and order starts to break down. Corf and two other members of his club, drive to the edge of the city to steal a cow; having killed it, they are joined by others. \\"We fought and squabbled over the division like savages.\\" They are soon attacked by \\"the dreaded peace officers of the ILW.\\" Injured, Corf and his friends, after further incidents and the abandonment of their car when a tire blows, return home without meat. A few days later there is a general flight from the city. Corf has little to eat, and his servants have fled. He and three others from the club leave the city on horses, which would soon have been confiscated for food. Corf aims to get to Menlo, where he has a house and livestock. The streets of San Francisco are deserted; there are abandoned automobiles, and soldiers guard public buildings. By contrast, in the working-class district, where ILW men live, families are living happily. In the country, conditions have become typical of apocalyptic and post- apocalyptic fiction, in which civilization has collapsed and communication has ceased (as there are no newspapers, and telegraph lines have been cut). \\"Two hundred thousand people had fled from San Francisco... They had swept everything clean. There had been robbery and fighting. Here and there we passed bodies by the roadside and saw the blackened ruins of farmhouses.\\" Corf finds that his house in Menlo has been emptied, and his housekeeper and other employees have all been killed. He eventually returns to San Francisco alone without his horse, which was stolen from him. He finds that the strike has been called off; the demands of the ILW have been granted. His servants return to him. He cannot discharge them, as they have been unionized by the ILW. The story ends with the narrator writing: \\"The tyranny of organized labor is getting beyond endurance. Something must be done.\\" References Category:Short stories by Jack London Category:1909 short stories Category:Eugene V.

These are all theories that deal with the nature of the object of illusory perception and not with the nature of the subject, whether the error consists in the object or in the subject‚Äôs cognition. There are five principal theories dealing with perceptual errors, which are:- *1) Asat-khyƒÅtivƒÅda (apprehension of the non-existent) (CƒÅrvƒÅka) ‚Äì what is being perceived (illusory) is really non-existent, the error consists in the apprehension of the unreal or in the perception of non-existent entities. *2) ƒÄtma-khyƒÅtivƒÅda (self-apprehension) (YogacƒÅrƒÅ Buddhism) ‚Äì it is the mental state projected outside as a mental image, the error occurs owing to the externalization of inner thoughts, by treating the internal object as external (extra-mental) and the error exists not in the object but in the subject. *3) AkhyƒÅtivƒÅda (non-apprehension) (PrabhƒÅkara Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ) ‚Äì the error is due to the failure to distinguish between perception and memory, it is due to the lack of right discrimination vis-√†-vis memory. *4) AnyathƒÅ-khyƒÅtivƒÅda (misapprehension) (NyƒÅya) ‚Äì the object perceived under illusion is real elsewhere, not here in front of the perceiver because of the mind connected with the object on account of memory, the error is due to wrong understanding of the presented and the represented, and occurs, as Vachaspati Mishra states - ‡§∏‡§¶‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§¶‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ó‡•É‡§π‡§Ø‡§§‡•á - when \\"one reality is mistaken for another\\". *5) Anirvacanƒ´ya-khyƒÅtivƒÅda (apprehension of the indescribable) (Advaita) ‚Äì the object is neither existent (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç) nor non-existent (‡§Ö‡§∏‡§§‡•ç) but indescribable (‡§Ö‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ö‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç), the illusory object is a product of ignorance (avidyƒÅ) about the substratum and the error is caused due to Maya which is also indescribable. An understanding of what is true and what is untrue is an integral part of philosophical study for acquisition of highest knowledge. Knowledge presupposes a subject of that knowledge and also the object corresponding to it. The nature of knowledge however depends upon the mind and the cognitive faculties of the subject as also on the conditions in which the object is situated in relation to the subject; an error is caused due to a peculiar relation formed by the perceiver and the position of the object. Inference, a valid mode of cognition, is based on previous perception, and an erroneous perception negates the value of perception. The first three of the afore-listed five theories admit that the object perceived illusorily is, in one way or the other, existent; the remaining two, do not accept this contention. Shankara explains that in Sampat Upasana there is the imposing (aropa) of a superior character on the inferior whereas in Pratika (adhyasa) Upasana the inferior form is contemplated as Brahman. ƒÄropa or illusion is 'mis-cognition' (avidyƒÅ), 'mis-appearance' (avabhƒÅsa), 'superimposition' (adhyƒÅsa), a 'misapplication' or a 'mis-presentation' which is not consciously persuaded unlike misperception and misunderstanding; and in which, neither the agent nor the subject have any active role to play. But, Aropa is not Adhyasa because there has to be an appearance which can make the delusive illusory appearance of a particular appearance a distinct possibility. Badarayana states that:- : ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡•Å ‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡§Ç ‡§§‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§¨‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡•å  : \\"From the meditation on the supreme Lord, however, becomes manifest that which remains obscured; because the soul‚Äôs bondage and freedom are derived from Him.\\" - (Brahma Sutras III.ii.5) which is so because bondage comes from the ignorance about the nature of God, and freedom comes from the knowledge of His reality when as a result of meditation on Him (with attributes) comes unsurpassable divinity and one becomes the Absolute with all the desires fulfilled. (Shvetashvatara Upanishad I.11). And that:- : ‡§Ö‡§§ ‡§è‡§µ ‡§ö‡•ã‡§™‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§§‡•ç  : \\"Hence also are the illustrations of the sun‚Äôs reflection (in water) etc.\\" ‚Äì (Brahma Sutras III.ii.19) which statement, Shankara explains, means that the one with attributes created by limiting adjuncts is not real but though One and present in all beings is seen as many. Aropa can be verbal (≈õabdi), and it can also be based upon sense (arthi) (meaning or implied), sometimes it is not expressed but is conveyed. Advaita Vedanta does not view the world of existence as an absolute reality, it is an imposition (aropa), it simply does not exist from the absolute standpoint; it is Anatman which the Atman accepts as a device for the purpose of self-realization, and for experiencing Divine Unity, the inseparableness of Atman and Anatman. The Dvaita School of Madhavacharya does not accept the Advaita illusionistic hypothesis or interpretation of reality as being deceptive and merely appearance- interpreting. Jayatirtha, while discussing KhyƒÅtivƒÅda, rejects PrabhƒÅkara‚Äôs view of the fusion of two cognitions i.e. fusion of percept and memory, resulting in illusory cognition. KhyƒÅtivƒÅda is based on the assumption that misperception is not simply the human failure to perceive correctly but is something which occurs due to some peculiar special circumstances, and that cognition can be either correct (pratyaksha) or incorrect (apratyaksha) depending upon the cognizing activity of the mind. Its theories are concerned with the nature of the object which is erroneously cognized and whose ontological status they logically examine.

Facilities for maintenance and refurbishment of U.S. nuclear weapons became dilapidated after the end of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The United States planned to spend about a trillion dollars over thirty years to rectify this shortfall, which some saw as a reversal from President Barack Obama's 2009 Prague speech that laid out his agenda for further nuclear disarmament, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. In 2015, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set its Doomsday Clock closer to midnight to highlight this development.

Their summary breaks down the 30 year budget in billions of dollars as follows: * 350 for the National Nuclear Security Administration which runs the facilities which research, develop and produce nuclear weapons * 240 to 270 for maintenance of the existing triad of bombers, land-based missiles and submarine-launched missiles * 120 for command, control and communications * 20 to 120 for a successor to the Minuteman missile. * 77 to 102 for Ohio-class submarines to carry missiles * 55 to 100 for a new strategic bomber to succeed the B2 * 10 to 20 for a Long Range Stand Off Weapon LRSO standoff missilehttp://thehill.com/blogs/pundits- blog/defense/341724-do-we-want-to-give-trump-a-new-nuke making a total of $872 billion to $1.082 trillion. $348 billion have already been committed for the first ten years of the program. In 2017, the Congressional Budget Office produced a report analysing the planned expenditure and its estimate of the total cost over 30 years was $1.2 trillion. This was before any additional capacity which might result from the Nuclear Posture Review of the Trump administration, which was expected to be completed in early 2018. Facilities The new National Security Campus was opened in 2014 to replace the older site of the Kansas City Plant. Their main program is to extend the life of the W76 warhead. The main facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration are: # The administrative headquarters known as the Albuquerque Complex # Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California which researches plutonium and global security # Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico which researches and runs computer simulations # The National Security Campus at Kansas City, which produces non-nuclear components of the weapons # Nevada National Security Site where nuclear weapons are tested # The Pantex Plant in Texas which assembles and disassembles nuclear weapons # Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico and California, which stress-tests nuclear weapons # The Savannah River Site in South Carolina which processes waste and produces tritium # The Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee where uranium is enriched and processed =National Security Campus= The old facility in Kansas City was originally an aero-engine plant which was converted to make components for nuclear weapons in 1949. After 50 years, it had become decrepit and was regularly flooded by a river. A replacement plant was opened on higher ground nearby in 2014 at a cost of $700 million. Equipment was transferred from the old plant including 30,000 crates and an 87,000 pound milling machine. The new facility is cleaner and more modern and will have lower running costs than the old one. Its main task now is to triple the life of the W76 warheads used on submarine-launched ballistic missiles from the original 20 years to 60 years. =Sandia= Z machine at Sandia which is used to simulate a thermonuclear device. The Sandia National Laboratories tests nuclear weapons to ensure they can withstand extreme physical stress such as missile launch and re-entry. Their testing equipment includes centrifuges, a rocket sled, six-inch cannon and wind tunnel. A major overhaul of these was completed in 2014, at a cost of about $100 million. Doomsday clock In January 2015, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set their Doomsday Clock at three minutes to midnight.

The order was devoted to providing care for those around them with an added emphasis on demonstrating the love of Jesus Christ while spreading the message of the Gospel to the public. She was cleared for beatification in 2015 after a miracle was found to have been attributed to her intercession. She was beatified on 31 October 2015 in Frascati. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the celebration on behalf of Pope Francis. Biography Maria Teresa Casini was born on 27 October 1864 to Tommaso Casini and Melania Rayner as their first born daughter; she was baptized on the following 29 October. She travelled to Rome for her studies at the Santa Rufina boarding school that the nuns of the Madams of the Sacred Heart conducted. She received her First Communion on 7 May 1878 which solidified her vocation. Due to a period of ill health, she had to leave school and return home for recuperation. Shortly after she turned eighteen, she responded to her vocation and met Father Arsenio Pellegrini who became her guide and her spiritual director and who served as the Abbot of the Basilian Monks of Grottaferrata. Despite entering the convent, ill health forced her to leave, though she attempted to enter once again yet failed due to the death of the foundress after which the institute she joined ceased to exist. In due time, she became a nun after entering the monastery of Sepolte Vive in Rome on 2 February 1885. Casini only started to live in Grottaferrata with fellow entrants from 17 October 1892 onwards. On 2 February 1894, she founded the Oblate Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It was not until 1925 that Casini started the special work of the \\"Little Friends of Jesus\\" in order to promote and to cultivate the vocations of prospective priests. The group's special character came to life when Cardinal Francesco Satolli requested Casini and her congregation to take up new and vigorous apostolic work. This group also worked for the sanctification of all priests and so the group opened a boarding school for males in order to sate the Lord's request for good and wholesome priests. Throughout her life, Casini offered \\"the oblation of herself, in faithful response to the Love that overflows from the open Heart of the Savior, and which she imparted to so many daughters and priests\\". This even earned the praise of Pope Pius X in 1904 who wrote: \\"In order to bring about the reign of Jesus Christ, nothing is more necessary than the sanctity of the clergy. God bless these sisters for their selfless love for these men of God, for through them, through the sacraments, we are fortified and purified for the journey\\". Casini grew ill in the final years of her life, and she died in 1937. Her final words were: \\"I am peaceful. I feel God is near me\\". =Legacy= Casini's order continues to flourish on an international level in places such as the United States of America and Argentina. The first of the males of the Little Friends of Jesus that Casini herself oversaw was ordained as a priest in 1938. Beatification The cause of beatification commenced on 26 January 1981 on a diocesan level which concluded its work in 1985; she was given the title Servant of God. It later submitted the Positio ‚Äì official documentation ‚Äì to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Pope John Paul II declared her to have lived a life of heroic virtue and named her Venerable on 7 July 1997. Pope Francis approved a decree that recognized a miracle attributed to her intercession on 22 January 2015, thus, clearing her for beatification. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification in Frascati on 31 October 2015.

He was affectionately known as Cocky Bung.A Dictionary of Scottish Phrase and Fable, Ian Crofton Life Young was born in Glasgow on 27 January 1747, the second son of John Young, a cooper. He matriculated in Glasgow University in 1764, graduating M.A. in 1769. He became assistant to Prof James Moor immediately thereafter. He succeeded Moor as professor of Greek in 1774 aged only 27. He was Clerk of the University Senate from 1779 and Curator of the College Chambers from 1781.https://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2318&type;=P On 9 June 1774 he was installed professor of Greek in Glasgow University, and proved a very efficient and popular teacher. Thomas Campbell (1777‚Äì1844) remembered him as \\"a man of great humour\\", ready to laugh heartily with his students over the whimsicalities of Lucian and Aristophanes (Beattie, Life and Letters of Campbell, i. 159). Captain Hamilton eulogises his scholarship and oratory, comparing his energetic sympathy with that of Burke (Cyril Thornton, chap. vii.). Wilson dedicated to Young and his colleague George Jardine \\"The Isle of Palms and other Poems\\", 1812, and, writing of \\"Homer and his Translators\\", he recalls how Young's reading of the Iliad \\"gave life to every line\\" (Wilson, Works, viii. 36). A large portion of Letter lxviii. in \\"Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk\\", vol. iii., is a eulogy of Young, with whose reading of Greek and his enthusiasm over the value of a particle or the sublimity of a poetical passage the writer was deeply impressed. A similar tribute occurs in Gleig's \\"Quarterly\\" article on Lockhart's \\"Life of Scott\\" (see Quarterly Review, lxxxv. 37, and Lang, Life and Letters of John Gibson Lockhart, i. 22). Young was devoted to the classical stage and an admirer of Edmund Kean. After filling his chair for nearly half a century, Young died in Glasgow on 18 November 1820. He is thought to have been buried with the other university professors at Blackfriars Churchyard, who were later re-interred in the \\"Professors Monument\\" in the Glasgow Necropolis.https://universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0019&type;=P Family On 25 Sept. 1780 Young married Jean Lamont, daughter of Colin Lamont of Knockdow, Argyleshire, who survived him with seven children. Their eldest son, John (1781‚Äì1852), received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Glasgow in 1810; was for a time chaplain of the East India Company; and died rector of Newdigate, Surrey, on 13 May 1852 (Gent. Mag. 1852, ii. 105). Charles, the fourth son (1796‚Äì1822), a classical scholar of great promise, died at Glasgow on 17 December 1822 (Foster, Alumni Oxon.; Gent. Mag. 1823, pt. i.).

The toilet had 128 seats: 64 for men and 64 for women. It operated from around 1 May 1421, until the seventeenth century. The Longhouse, though it was not London's first public toilet, was the first public toilet in the capital divided by gender. The Longhouse, and the similarly financed almshouse for five or six parishioners constructed above it, was built by the parish of St Martin Vintry, on a long dock over the Thames. It was on Walbrook Street, at the time an actual brook, approximately where the modern Bell Wharf Lane is, and was \\"flushed by the Thames\\". The waste was deposited in a gully which was washed by the tides twice a day ‚Äì the Thames being tidal there. Rexroth in his 2007 book Deviance and Power in Late Medieval London argues that with the construction of the almshouse above the privies: \\"pauperes were assigned new households\\" where shame had been banished (due to the gender segregation). By the seventeenth century the almshouse was being let on a commercial basis, possibly even as warehousing. The Longhouse was destroyed in the Great Fire of London and rebuilt on a more modest scale. The new building had six male and six female seats, and, apart from a period where the lessees kept it locked, continued in use until at least 1851, as it is mentioned in an 80-year lease that commenced that year. In a 1935 lease, however, no mention is made, and it is assumed the facilities were by that time closed. After World War Two, the site was rebuilt in 1953 as part of \\"Redevelopment unit number 10\\". There is, however, as of 2015, a Bell Wharf Lane public toilet. The Longhouse and the other gifts to London, notably improvements to the water supply and a more substantial almshouse as well as schools and hospitals, are credited with raising the profile of Dick Whittington among Londoners, and for leading to the legends that surround his name. Longhouse became a byword for privy, presumably derived from Whittington's Longhouse.P. E. Jones Whittington's Longhouse, London Topographical Record, 23, 1972. Pages 27-34.

Mostaert probably made the painting between c. 1525 and 1530, or slightly earlier. The exact subject of the painting has long been unclear, although numerous ideas have been put forward, including that the depicted figure is a soldier, a nobleman or Saint Maurice. The portrait is significant in that it may portray the earliest portrait of a specific black man in European painting, though Saint Maurice, and Balthazar of the Three Kings or Biblical Magi, had long been usually portrayed as black. Subject If it is a portrait of a specific real individual, it appears to be the earliest known such painting of a black man in European painting. The Rijksmuseum, who own the painting, have said that it might be Christophle le More (Christopher the Moor), a black archer recorded at the court of the Habsburg emperor Charles V. This theory could be supported by the badge of the Virgin on his cap, which would be a souvenir from a pilgrimage to Halle. He has also been said to be a member of the entourage of Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy at her court in Mechelen. The posture, clothing and other details could indicate service at a European court and adaptation to their norms. The English historian Kate Lowe therefore argues he is a nobleman in the service of a visitor to the court at Mechelen, or such a visitor himself. Other scholars suggest that the insignia on his hat and bag may indicate possible Spanish or Portuguese origins. In 2013, Wim Pijbes, in a discussion on the Dutch folklore figure Zwarte Piet and his origins, mentions the Portrait of an African Man, saying that the figure of Zwarte Piet is traceable to at least the 16th century, and the proud black figure depicted wearing a velvet jacket and a beret shows attributes nowadays associated with the figure of Zwarte Piet. In November 2014 a different explanation was offered by the literary and medieval scholar Marie-Jos√© Govers. She claimed the figure represented Saint Maurice, a Roman soldier who by tradition came from Thebes. Govers was to publish her research in 2015 but did so earlier to refute the remarks of Pijbes. She said that the figure depicted was an important man, not a servant. She bases this on the goatskin gloves, the belt which is covered with gemstones and the sword. She also adds that the sword is especially an attribute of Saint Maurice and that the pilgrim badge of Mary on his red beret makes him a Catholic. Govers adds that the time when the painting was made is also important. Govers claims this to be between 1520 and 1525 (disagreeing with the Rijksmuseum's view that the latter is about the earliest likely date). During that period Martin Luther was seen as a threat to the Catholic ruler Charles V. Luther was excommunicated by the Pope in 1520. Struggles between Catholics and Protestants were often violent. The depiction of Saint Maurice, a Christian who refused to fight against other Christians, could be related to this. The art historian and curator Esther Schreuder disagrees with Govers's findings, stating that the evidence presented by Govers is too meager. Schreuder claims the sword is a typical symbol for a soldier and that Saint Maurice is most often depicted with a holy spear. Saint Maurice Saint Maurice was very often depicted as a black soldier in northern Europe, and the years just before Mostaert's painting had produced such depictions in altarpieces by the leading artists Matthias Gr√ºnewald (c. 1517‚Äì23) and Lucas Cranach the Elder (1522‚Äì25).The Gr√ºnewald and the Cranach But the small size of the Mostaert is more typical of a personal portrait.

This Highland Railway station was served by trains on the Buckie and Portessie Branch north of Keith until 1915 and remained open for freight until April 1944. History Work had begun on the Keith to Portessie line of the Highland Railway on 7 November 1882.The station was opened by the Highland Railway in 1884 to serve the sizeable town of Buckie but had a short life with services being suspended during World War I on 9 August 1915 In 1917 the track between Aultmore (towards Keith) and Portessie was requisitioned by the Admiralty and the rails south of Buckie removed as far as Aultmore, although it was the intention to reinstate the track and restart services when the war ended. The north and south sections of line were re-opened by 1919 but the central section of the line was still without track in 1923, when the Highland Railway was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). After this amalgamation the track between Buckie and Aultmore was relaid, however services were not restarted and the track removed again in around 1937.Geograph The line to Aultmore became the terminus of a goods spur from Keith and continued in use until 1966 and the separated stub from Buckie to Portessie survived until 1944 in isolation from the rest of the, by then, London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) system. The construction of the GNoSR Moray coast route had \\"effectively doomed the Highland route. Westbound journeys were shorter via the GNSR, and although the route to Aberdeen was longer, the Moray Coast Railway had services that were faster, more frequent and more convenient, with through trains running from Elgin, along the coast and to Aberdeen. As a rather straggly branch line, the Highland route struggled to compete, and the population between Buckie and Keith was too sparse to provide much additional traffic.\\"Long Lost Railways Accessed : 2015-01-23 =Infrastructure= The station was accessed via East Cathcart Street and stood near the old Cluny Rope and Sail Works and the United Free Church.

They can be recognized thanks to the 5 grey sutures on the upper face, exhibiting distinctive zig-zag pattern. The oral face is clearer.

Career =Early career= Yuta started his baseball career in 4th grade as an outfielder for the Wakaba Elementary School, and in 6th grade, made it to the semi-finals of a national baseball tournament. He doubled as 1st-base infielder and pitcher for the Kumamoto Hitsuyukan Senior High but his team never made it to nationals. He entered the Yokohama College of Commerce, and in his sophomore year, was chosen to pitch for the national team for the US-Japan Collegiate Baseball Championships. In his senior year, he was awarded Best Nine in the Kanagawa University Baseball League after winning 6 games in the tournament. =Hanshin Tigers= He was the Tiger's 1st round 3rd alternative pick during the 2013 professional draft (after not winning the lottery for Daichi Ohsera and Yuta Kakita). He signed a 100 million yen contract with Hanshin plus a 50 million yen signing bonus, for an estimated annual salary of 15 million yen. He was assigned the jersey no. 17. 2014 He joined the main squad for spring camp training in Okinawa, and started the practice game against the Eagles on Feb 19. After the game, he felt pain in his left ankle resulting from a torn ligament, and was consequently restrained from pitching further until he was fully healed. He resumed pitching in the Western League farm games in July, and finally debuted in his first official start on the August 10 home game against the Carps in Kyocera Dome where he gave up 4 runs in 4 innings. His first win came a week after in a match against the Baystars, where he allowed only two runs over 5‚Öì innings. He had four more starts after that, but unfortunately lost all of them. He finished the season with a 1‚Äì4 record, and an ERA of 4.60. 2015 During spring camp, he competed with fellow 2013 draft and lefty Suguru Iwazaki for a spot in the pitching rotation, but in the end, Iwazaki prevailed. Only when Iwazaki fell into a slump mid-season did Iwasada get a chance to make it to the lineup. He started the May 24 match against the Baystars, but pitched poorly and promptly lost the match. He made up for it in his next start against the Marines during the interleague, where he pitched 7 scoreless innings and earned his first and only win for the season, and his first ever victory in Koshien. During off-season, he was selected to pitch for the national team in the Winter League games in Taiwan. After pitching in 5 games, he received the league's Most Valuable Pitcher award after a 2‚Äì0 record and an astounding ERA of 0.53. 2016 This was Iwasada's breakout season. He trained with the farm team during spring camp, but his good performance on the plate earned him the 6th spot in the starting rotation when the season started. On April 2, he pitched 7 scoreless innings and struck out 12 batters, earning him the win in his first outing against the Baystars. His next start against the Carps was equally successful, and he achieved his first ever consecutive double digit strikeout record. He continued this streak on April 16, and became the first NPB southpaw pitcher and the only one from Central League to start their season with 3 consecutive double digit strikeouts. On May 27, he single-handedly pitched a 1-0 complete shutout victory against the Giants, and became the first Hanshin pitcher to record a shutout victory against their arch rivals on his first outing against them. He fell into a slump during the Inter-league games in June, but his previous feats earned him his first ever spot in the mid-season All Star Series where he pitched as a reliever in Game 2. He had a few more shaky starts in the following weeks, but he recovered and became unstoppable in September where he recorded 4 wins with a 0.58 ERA. This won him his first ever Central League MVP of the Month award. He recorded his 10th win on his last start in Koshien, and finished the season with a personal best 10-9 record, 156 strike outs and a 2.90 ERA. He also had a 3-0 record and 0.58 ERA against the Giants, the best among the Tigers pitchers for the season. 2018 He was also selected to pitch for the 2018 All- Star Series. Playing Style Pitch Distribution for Yuta Iwasada He throws a four-seam fastball as his main pitch (max velocity of 148 km/h), and alternates with a cutter in the mid 130s, a slider in 120s and a change-up with a wide velocity range. Also included in his arsenal are a shuuto, a slow curveball in the low 110s, and occasionally a fork ball. In 2016, Tigers ace Atsushi Nohmi started teaching him how to master his specialty pitch, the forkball, as well as tips on how to control his changeup better.

It is composed of five Local Government Areas in Edo State. Esanland lies west of the banks of the Niger River. It is bordered by Kogi State, Delta State, Edo South Senatorial District, and Edo North Senatorial District. Esanland covers about 2,800 square kilometers and is home to over half a million people. The Esan people and culture of Esanland are generally homogenous. Esanland has been inhabited since the late Iron Age, by hunter-gatherers from the Nok culture. The hunter gatherers formed a society in northern Esanland until the 12th century. In the 15th century, indigenes from the Great Benin Empire moved to Esanland and renewed Edo-Esan cultural bonds as the Benin were the Royal blood and Emperor controlling the Southern Hemisphere. Esan nations often worked either in tandem or subordination towards the Benin Empire, sending soldiers to the Benin army and treating their rulers as dukes to the Oba of Benin. Trade with the Portuguese brought modern innovations such as Dane guns and spoons, and new crops. Independent rule in Esanland continued into the 1800s, until the British claimed the entire region for the Royal Niger Company as part of the colony Nigeria. Local opposition to the conquest was vocal, and such as King Ogbidi Okojie of Uromi banded together their soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt to fight British rule. After the British takeover, independence movements sprung up. Leaders in Esanland such as Anthony Enahoro successfully campaigned for independence, which was granted to the whole of Nigeria. Since independence, Esanland has suffered from poor infrastructure and an attempted takeover in the Nigerian Civil War by Biafra. Etymology Esanland originates from the term E san fia or they have fled in Edo language, referring to the flight of refugees from the Benin Empire to the surrounding forest that make up the original Esans. History According to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah- forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years. These people were likely associated with the Nok people and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests. To this day, northern Esan dialects have more in common with Northern Edo languages such as Etsako and Owan than southern Esan dialects do, which happen to be closely related with Edo. These \\"proto-Edoid\\" peoples grew yam, oil palm and vegetables, but also hunted and gathered. Starting from 500 AD to 750 AD, these hunter-gatherers started to colonize the savannah-forest ecosystem of Esanland and the forest ecosystem of the Benin Empire. They created a pre-Esan, pre-Edo society that built advanced structures such as moats and walls around family properties. These enclosures were, at maximum, three to five kilometers in diameter, and demarcated residential and agricultural property. Those properties enlarged to become villages, and by 800 AD, these village coalesced to form kingdoms with hierarchies. Modern-day digs in the region have found that these walls were situated in the eastern Benin Empire and northern Esanland. Settlements were close to permanent springs on the northern plateau, but never next to intermittent springs. Esanland's culture, language and growth were majorly influenced by the mass exoduses to Esan territory from all adjacent polities Communities on Esanland's southern and eastern fringes (Ewohimi, Ewatto, Ekpon, Amahor) were heavily populated by Igbos and Igalas (into Uroh); from the north came the Emai into Ukhun, Idoa, and Amahor and the Etsako into Irrua); and from the south came the Itsekiri (into Ekpon) and Urhobo (into Ujiogba). The biggest influence on Esanland came from the Benin Empire. In 1460, Oba Ewuare passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking. These laws proved too restrictive for many citizens, and these citizens fled the kingdom to Esanland. This exodus shaped Esanland's modern cultural identity and gave rise to the term \\"Esan,\\" or \\"refugee.\\" Oral tradition has heavily supported this theory. Prominent Esan and Edo historians have collected stories about this migration. = Pre-colonization = Esan kingdoms had a varying degree of autonomy, but were ultimately controlled by the Benin Empire. The Oba approved the of Esanland, and Esan kingdoms paid tribute to Benin. Yet, several wars between Esan kingdoms and Benin were recorded. This was due to the Oba, at ascension on the throne, sending white chalk to the Esans as a term of friendship. If the chalk was rejected, then the Oba would try to invade Esanland. The varying political stabilities of Benin and the Esan kingdoms also led to warfare. Such warfare was so common that there is no recorded history of peace between all of the Esan kingdoms and Benin. Esanland was extensively involved in world trade. Benin's sovereignty over Esanland enabled it to send long-distant traders, or . Ekhen procured cloth, ivory, peppers and resources. Portugal primarily received blue cloth, or from Esanland in exchange for tobacco, brandy, mirror, beads, and firearms, primarily through . During the 16th century, the Uzea War occurred. This war was between the Uromi Kingdom and the Benin Kingdom. The war lasted from 1502 to 1503, and resulted from a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba of Uromi. The war ended at the town of Uzea, when both leaders were killed. However, in peaceful times Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and the sacking of Akure in 1823. During the nineteenth century, northern Esanland was continually attacked and sacked by the Muslim Nupe people in the hunt for slaves and converts to Islam, having previously taken over the Kukuruku peoples‚Äô lands. Many Esan kingdoms from the south helped in the battle to fend off the Nupes. The battles came into the Esans‚Äô favor; several Nupe and Etsako warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. The nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products. = Esan warfare and colonization = Prince Okojie and his entourage. In 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue. The first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a guerrilla warfare strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901. On March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by Prince Okojie, was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar. This process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued guerilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain's part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division. Politics and government Esan kingdoms were structured in a way that , or cities, were headed by , singular . were subdivided into villages, which were subdivided into or quarters.

It is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda. It is one of 14 Shaiva Upanishads. The Upanishad is a discourse by Kalagni Rudra (Shiva) to sage Sanatkumara on the Tripundra, the Shaiva sectarian tilaka consisting of three horizontal lines of sacred ash on the forehead. The allegorical significance of the \\"three ash lines\\", states Deussen, is that the tradition sees them as streaks of three Vedic fires, three audible syllables of AUM, three Gu·πáas, three worlds, three Atmans, three Vedas and three aspects of Shiva. The text extols the Tripundra and tells about the procedure for applying Vibhuti (sacred ash) as Tripundra on various parts of the body with the associated mantras and rites. Klaus Klostermaier classifies the Kalagni Rudra Upanishad with the Bhasmajabala Upanishad, the Rudrakshajabala Upanishad, the Brihajjabala Upanishad and the Akshamalika Upanishad as Shaiva texts that explain sectarian symbolism in Shaivism. Name Kalagni, or Kala- Agni, means \\"fire that is time\\". Rudra is the prime mover and destroyer of material world as well as time. Together, states Kramrisch, Kalagni-Rudra connote the principles and time as relentless divine manifestation of that where \\"at the end all the universe is gathered\\". Kalagni-Rudra is an epithet of Shiva, related to Bhairava, one who creates everything from fire and then burns everything ‚Äì gods, men and demons ‚Äì to ashes. The text like other Shaiva Upanishads, states Klostermaier, is premised on identifying Shiva as identical to the Hindu concept of Ultimate Reality (Brahman). It is part of the Upanishadic collection, starting with Shvetashvatara Upanishad, which together teach the theory of Vedanta and the practice of Yoga as a means of salvation. Shiva is within as the Atman, assert these texts, the realization of this Shiva is means to infinite peace, and ritual of producing \\"fire, ashes and leftovers\\", then smearing oneself with the ashes on the forehead is a constant reminder of the spiritual essence. The lines of ashes on the forehead is called Tilaka or Pundra, while Tri means three. Contents Tripundra lines on a dancer After a traditional invocation, Sage Sanatkumara requests Kalagni Rudra to explain the application of the Tripundra, a sectarian mark in the form of three lines of vibhuti (sacred ash), and to enlighten him on the specifications of the material used, the procedure to prepare it, the place from where it is to be procured, and its beneficial effects. Kalagni Rudra explains to Sanatkumara that Tripundra material should be ash from fires. The ash should be collected reciting the Sathyojatam hymn from Taittiriya Aranyaka, of Pancha Brahman and dedicated using Agnir iti bhasma (from Atharvashiras Upanishad, where the five elements ‚Äì fire, air, ether, water and earth ‚Äì are all equated to ash. The sacred ash should be mixed with water, reciting the \\"manas toke hymn\\" of the Rigveda. Reciting the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra (Tryambakam yajamahe...), the ash is then applied across the head, forehead, chest, and shoulders in three horizontal lines. The hymns Trayayusha, Trayambaka, and Trishakti should be recited. The three markings on the forehead cover a space vertically from the forehead to the eyebrow, and extending from the midpoint of one eyebrow across to the midpoint of the other. This mark is the vow of Shambhu (Shiva), and it leads one to liberation from suffering and rebirth. The text, in chapter 2, explains the three lines as various triads: sacred fires, syllables of Om, gunas, worlds, types of atman (Soul), powers, Vedas, the time of extraction of the Vedic drink Soma, and Mahesvara (a form of Shiva). The first line is equated to Garhapatya (the sacred fire in a household kitchen), the A syllable of Om, the Rajas guna, the earth, the external Atman, KriyƒÅ - the power of action, the Rigveda, the morning extraction of Soma, and Maheshvara. The second streak of ash is a reminder of Dakshinagni (the holy fire lighted in the South for ancestors), the sound U of Om, Sattva guna, the atmosphere, the inner Atman, Iccha - the power of will, the Yajurveda, midday Soma extraction, and Sadashiva. The third streak is the Ahavaniya (the fire used for Homa), the M syllable in Om, the Tamas guna, Svarga - heaven, the Paramatman - the highest Atman (Brahman), the power of perception, the Samaveda, Soma extraction at dusk, and Shiva. Kalagni Rudra extols the benefits of wearing the Tripundra by any person in any of the four stages of the human life (see Ashrama (stage)): student, householder, forest dweller, and renouncer. The Tripundra absolves one of all sin. With this ritual smearing, asserts the text, he becomes equal to one who has bathed in all holy places and the one who spends all his time reciting the Rudra hymn.

It is associated with the Rigveda. It is one of 14 Shaiva (Shiva-related) Upanishads. The Upanishad describes akshamala (rosary) and its importance in japa, the meditative repetition of a mantra. The text mentions different types of rosaries, their significance, the relevant mantras, and the symbolism. The inner thread of Japa Mala, states the text, signifies the Ultimate Reality (Brahman-Atman), the silver thread on its right symbolizes Shiva, the copper thread on left of Vishnu, the face is Sarasvati, the bottom is Gayatri, the hole of each bead a reminder of Jnana (knowledge), and the knot is Prakriti (nature). Klaus Klostermaier classifies this text with the Bhasmajabala Upanishad, the Rudrakshajabala Upanishad, the Brihajjabala Upanishad and the Kalagni Rudra Upanishad as Shaiva texts that explain symbolism of rites and objects of worship in Shaivism. While this Shaiva Upanishadic text discusses consecration and use of rosary for meditation, the use of rosary is common in other traditions. It is also known as Aksamalikopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume1 Part 3, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 267-269 Name The akshamala denotes a string made up of beads where each bead represents the 50 letters of the alphabet, a (‡§Ö) to ksha (‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑), hence it is known as Akshamalika Upanishad. Alternate names for rosaries, states Ernst Leumann, that appear in Jaina and Hindu texts are akshamala, akshamalika, akshasutra, rudrashamala, carcakamala and japamala.Ernst Leumann, , pages 885-886 History The date of composition and the author of this text are unknown. Like most sectarian Upanishads, the text is likely a late medieval, post-12th century era Upanishad and it is neither part of the 17th century compilation of 50 important Upanishads published by Mughal era Dara Shikoh, nor part of the 18th-century anthology of 52 popular Upanishads in North India published by Colebrooke, nor is it found in the Bibliotheca Indica anthology of popular Upanishads in South India by Narayana. In a Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika in the modern era, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at serial number 67. Contents The Akshamalika Upanishad is structured as a discourse between Prajapati and Guha (Kartikeya, the god of war). Prajapati asks Guha about the akshamala (rosary): its rules, types, colours, materials used for making it, threads, and so forth. Guha replies that the rosary can be made of 10 things: coral or rubies (varies in translations), pearls, marble or crystal, shankha (conch), silver or Tulsi (varies in translations), gold, sandalwood, Putrajiva - fruits of the fiscus tree, lotuses and rudrakshas. Gold, silver and copper threads, states the text, are used on either side. It should have fifty beads, corresponding to the characters of Sanskrit alphabet. The beads should be worn in a circle, the \\"face\\" of the bead should touch the face of another and bases of the beads should be aligned. The internal thread of gold represents the Supreme Brahman. The silver thread of the right and copper thread on the left symbolize the gods Shiva and Vishnu respectively. The face and base of the beads denote goddesses Sarasvati and Gayatri. The holes are Knowledge and the knot of the thread is Prakriti (Nature). The beads representing vowels, mute consonants and other consonants should be white, yellowish and red and denote sattva, tamas and rajas gunas respectively. The text thereafter asserts the procedure for consecration of the akshamala. It should be bathed in milk of five types of cows, followed by five products from a cow (Panchagavya), and then sprinkled with Darbha grass water. The beads, states the text, should then be immersed in sandalwood water reciting Omkara (‡§ì‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ô‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ). Then, it be smeared with eight fragrant pastes, placed on a bed of flowers and each bead be consecrated and woven with a mantra related to the corresponding 50 letters of the alphabet (a to ksha), invoking the characters to be resident in the beads. The 50 mantras - each of which narrates the powers of the specific character (16 vowels followed by 34 consonants) - are listed. The gods residing in earth, space and heaven as well as the ancestors are invited to dwell in the beads. The akshamala is to be treated as a goddess, and used in meditation, states the text. It expiates sin, asserts the text. Influence The use of 108 beaded Akshamala is not limited to Shaiva tradition, but found in other Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavas, as well as among the Buddhists.James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, , pages 24-25 The method of consecration and invocation with mantras is similar in all these traditions.Eva Rudy Jansen (2011), The Book of Buddhas, Binkey Kok, , page 21 The origins of the use of rosary for prayers and meditation among Jesuits and Roman Catholic monks, states Guy Beck, is traceable to India.

History The mosque was constructed under the order of Hongwu Emperor of Ming Dynasty in 1388. The construction of the mosque was completed in 1392. During the Xuande Emperor rule, Zheng He appealed for the mosque to undergo renovation and the first significant repairs took place in 1430. Further expansion and repairs were commissioned by the Jiajing Emperor in the mid-sixteenth century. Other repairs occurred in 1492, 1877, 1879, 1957, 1982, 1984, and 2002. By the late 19th century, the mosque was reduced from being originally 264 acres to a mere 1650 square meters in consequence of the Taiping Rebellion and to reduce the taxes owed by the mosque. The current structure was constructed in the late Qing Dynasty and its area has been reduced to 0.4 hectares. In 2007, the mosque underwent reparation and renovation with the support of Nanjing municipal government. In 2014, the government added the adjacent primary school into the mosque area, thus doubling its area.  Architecture  Jinjue Mosque is elaborately styled in a Sino-Islamic fashion. The three-entry gate has an imitation imperial tablet in the top center that reads \\"bestowed by imperial order\\" and below that it reads \\"Jingjuesi\\" (the name of the mosque).

Life =Early years= Heinz Graffunder as born into a working-class family in Berlin. His father worked as a pipefitter. Like others of his generation, the final part of his schooling was accelerated due to the pressures of World War II. He was then conscripted into the German army, which led to a period as a prisoner of war. The war itself ended approximately five months after his eighteenth birthday with Berlin occupied by Soviet troops. They would remain in the eastern part of what remained of Germany for nearly five decades. On his release Graffunder undertook an apprenticeship in the building trade. =Architecture= In October 1949 the German Democratic Republic was formally launched out of what had previously been better known as the Soviet occupation zone, although the basis for a return to one-party government had already been set in place with the creation of a ruling party back in 1946: in reality building the new country was an iterative process lasting many years, and involving a necessarily massive building boom. Between 1949 and 1952 Graffunder studied architecture at the city's Building Academy (Vereinigten Bauschulen von Gro√ü-Berlin)Abri√ü w√§re Verdr√§ngen. Gespr√§ch mit dem Architekten Heinz Graffunder. Interview in der M√§rkischen Allgemeinen Zeitung vom 21. August 1992 After that, between 1952 and 1967, he worked as an architect and city planner. He was employed as department head with Berlin's \\"VEB Development Project Support\\" organisation (\\"Bauprojektbetreuung Gro√ü- Berlin\\") and with its various successor entities. Apartment blocks in the Berlin Friedrichsgracht (Heinz Graffunder & Eckart Schmidt 1963-65) Elephant House (Humans' entrance), Berlin Zoo (Heinz Graffunder) The Palace of the Republic in 1976 (Heinz Graffunder 1973-76) The first fifteen years Graffunder is remembered, in particular, for the impact of his work on the north-eastern part of Berlin, but he also received commissions from outside the German Democratic Republic. During the years up to 1967 he was responsible for the following construction projects: * Residential developments in Berlin- Friedrichshain and Berlin-Lichtenberg. * Since its opening in 1954, buildings at the city's zoo in Berlin-Friedrichsfelde, including the Alfred Brehm building and the Elephant House. * 1957-1960 Outdoor swimming pool at Berlin- Pankow * 1967-1973 City Hall Approaches (Rathauspassagen). * 1963‚Äì1965 East German embassy in Budapest (joint commission with Eckart Schmidt). Today the post reunification German embassy. * Buildings for zoos in Rostock, Cottbus, Neustrelitz, Magdeburg and Erfurt. * 1964-1966 Project leadership for apartment blocks in the Berlin Friedrichsgracht (joint commission with Eckart Schmidt). * Sofia Central Station (project led by Milko Bechev). Middle years Between 1967 and 1972 he worked as section head for the Berlin's extensive state-owned apartment construction project (VEB Projektierung des Volkseigenen Wohnungsbaukombinates). His responsibilities included handling with Eckart Schmidt the formidable Rathauspassagen development, including Liebknechtstra√üe, along with a share in the architectural oversight of the residential complex at Berlin-Fennpfuhl Palace of the Republic Between 1972 and 1973 he was chief architect in the Institute for Residential and Social Development at the East German Building Academy. After that he headed up the project cooperative and was chief architect for the Palace of the Republic, built between 1973 and 1976 (and controversially demolished some 40 years later). This was almost certainly the most high-profile of his projects. The building accommodated the official legislature of the German Democratic Republic. After reunification the building was no longer needed for this purpose and refurbishment attempts were hampered by the discovery of large quantities of asbestos in its construction. Later career After completion of the \\"Palace\\" he went on to work, between 1976 and 1988, as Chief architect and director of large redevelopment projects in Berlin-Marzahn and Berlin-Hellersdorf. He also took a post, initially in 1984 as a guest lecturer and subsequently with a full-time professorship of Design Theory, at the Brandenburg University of Technology in Cottbus. After reunification As the German Democratic Republic moved into its final phase, in 1989 Graffunder retired on grounds of invalidity. Nevertheless, following reunification, between 1990 and his death in 1994 he operated his own Architecture Bureau in Berlin. Commissions included two garden centres, several hotel developments and urban development projects. At this time he involved himself in plans for the preservation of the Palace of the Republic, now that its original purpose had been overtaken by political changes. He prepared several proposals for converting and extending the building which were presented to the public in an exhibition. His most ambitious proposal involved positioning a new four level block building in front of the Palace, copying the facade of the original and connecting the two with glass and steel walkways, creating a new unified structure. He was able to call in support from several politicians, but he was unable to stop the decision to tear the building down. Nevertheless, at the time of his death early in December 1994 the demolition of the Palace of the Republic had not yet been carried out. Prizes and honours * 1969 National Prize of East Germany for Berlin zoo * 1976 National Prize of East Germany for the Palace of the Republic In 2004, to mark the tenth anniversary of his death, a small park was named after Heinz Graffunder, on the site of a former apartment block that he had designed. After reunification the tenants had moved out and the empty building had fallen into disrepair, which is why it had been demolished.

It is among the 31 Upanishads associated with the Atharvaveda. It is classified as a Shaiva Upanishad focussed on god Rudra. The Upanishad is notable for asserting that all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible. Rudra is Atman and Brahman, and in the heart. Rudra's symbol is Om, states the text, he can be realized by abandoning anger and lust, and through silence alone. The text is known for its monism (Advaita), and was quoted extensively by the German philosopher Hegel.H Glasenapp (1974), Die Philosophie der Inder, Kr√∂ner, , pages 259-260 It is also known as Atharvasirasopanishad, Atharvashira, Atharvasira in some texts referencing it, and as ≈öira Upanishad in MuktikƒÅ canon of 108 Upanishads. Chronology The Atharvasiras Upanishad is an ancient text likely written in BCE, but its exact dating is uncertain. It is mentioned in Gautama Dharmasutras verse 19.12,Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmas≈´tras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford World Classics, Oxford University Press, , page 112 Baudhayana Dharmasutra verse 3.10.10,Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmas≈´tras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford World Classics, Oxford University Press, , page 226 Vasistha Dharmasutras verse 22.9 and elsewhere.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmas≈´tras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford World Classics, Oxford University Press, , page 310, 323 The Upanishad, states Parmeshwaranand, belongs to the category of \\"later Upanishads\\", and he dates it to approximately 5th century BCE. Deussen remarks that it is from the group of five Upanishads which assert god Shiva as a symbolism for Atman in Hinduism. These five Upanishads ‚Äì Atharvashiras, Atharvashikha, Nilarudra, Kalagnirudra and Kaivalya ‚Äì are ancient, with Nilarudra likely the oldest and Kaivalya the relatively later era Upanishad (still BCE) composed closer to the time of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, Mundaka Upanishad, and Mahanarayana Upanishad. Structure The text consists of 7 chapters, mostly prose with some verses. Several versions of the text are known, and the surviving manuscripts show evidence of being corrupted. Contents =Who is Rudra?= The Chapter 1 of the text begins with the answer to the question, \\"Who is Rudra?\\" He is introduced as that one \\"which existed at first, exists now and shall exist in future\\", the eternal and the non-eternal, the visible and the invisible, the Brahman and the non-Brahman, the east and west and north and south and above and below, the masculine and feminine and neuter, the Savitri and Gayatri, the appearance and the reality, the water and the fire, the cow and the buffalo, the lotus flower and the soma filter, the within and the without, the inner essence of everything. This chapter references and includes fragments of hymns from Atharvaveda sections 4.1 and 10.8, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad section 6.1 and Chandogya Upanishad section 7.25, however it expresses those ideas through Rudra. =Rudra is the exalted one, is all gods, is universe= Rudra is described as the essence of all gods, all living beings, one with the universe and as Maheshvara in the text. Chapter 2 is set in repeating verse style, of the form: The same verse is repeated with Brahma replaced with the names of numerous gods (Vishnu, Skanda, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Surya and others), thereafter replaced by objects of nature, substances, direction, colors, mantras, concepts (Truth), with the last verse stating \\"Rudra is the exalted one, he is the Universe, to him salutation, the salutation\\". Chapter 3 is set in prose, and continues to assert the oneness of everything and everyone as Rudra. He is asserted as growth, as prosperity, as peace, as all, as non-all, as whole, as non-whole, as done, as non-done, the principle behind everything and the highest goal of every living form and everything that changes. The Upanishad then references and includes a fragment of hymn 8.48.3 of the Rigveda, stating that the one who has seen this light can have no fear of anyone's hostility or malice:Compare: See Deussen et al (1997), page 772 Rigveda 8.48.3: ‡§Ö‡§™‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•ã‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ó‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç ‡•§ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§®‡•Ç‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§£‡§µ‡§¶‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡§ø‡§É ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Æ‡•Å ‡§ß‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡§Æ‡•É‡§§ ‡§Æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡••‡•©‡•• - ‡§ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§¶: ‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡•Æ.‡•™‡•Æ, Wikisource Atharvasiras Upanishad ‡•• ‡•©‡••: ‡§Ö‡§™‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•ã‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ó‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç ‡•§ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§®‡•Ç‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§£‡§µ‡§¶‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡§ø‡§É ‡§ï‡§ø‡§Æ‡•Å ‡§ß‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡•§ ‡•• ‡§Ö‡§•‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§∂‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ç ‡•• SanskritDocuments.Org The soul, asserts the text, existed before the Soma and Surya. The whole world is Om symbol, and all deities, all vital breaths and He (Rudra) too is in the heart of each living being. Om is the holy call, Om is Rudra, he is infinite, he is protecting, he is the pure, he is the subtle, he is the lightning like, he is the highest Brahman, he is the One, he is the Rudra, he is the exalted Maheshvara, adds the text. =Rudra is Om, both symbolism for Atman, Brahman and the world= The Upanishad states that Rudra is resident in the soul in the heart. In chapter 4, the text offers mystical explanations to why Rudra is described the way he is. He is called Om, states the text, because when uttered he makes Prana go upwards. He is called the holy call because he is the essence of all the Vedas. He is called all prevading because he permeates the silence of the universe. He is called infinite because when uttered there is no end of it in any dimension, states the text. He is called protecting, because he removes the fear of rebirth and suffering. He is called subtle, asserts the text, because uttering him makes the limbs tinge. He is called the highest Brahman because he is the highest of the highest, the highest goal, the strength that strengthens the strong. He is called the one because everything ends in him and he unites all creatures. He, asserts the text is called the exalted Maheshwara because from him all the Vedas flow and in him is raised through the perception of the Atman (soul, self) and the mastery of Yoga. Rudra is in all men, omnipresent, he was born, and he will be born, he is in all the world spaces, begins chapter 5. One Rudra there is, states the Upanishad, and he has no second. He dwells in all living beings, and they return in him when they end. Through him, the whole universe spreads out. Whoever knows him, enters peace. He is unity, he is eternal, he is energy, he is Om, he is silence that follows Om. =Rudra is one without a second, the Pashupata= Chapter 5 of the text asserts that one should revere Rudra as one, he has no second. He dwells within, those who abandon anger, greed and worldly desires realize him and attain peace. Fire, states the text, is ultimately ashes, wind is ashes, water is ashes, earth is ashes, universe is ashes, the body and mind are ashes, and thus the Pashupata covers himself with ashes as a form of prayer. Rudra is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. One who seeks him gets immense bliss. Rudra is everywhere, he is all matter, he is in fire, he is in water, he has become plants and trees, he has become all living beings, states chapter 6 of the Upanishad. Nothing exists apart from Rudra. He is eternal, from which time is born. Nothing is earlier, and nothing later, he pervades all the world. Reception The Atharvashiras Upanishad was one of the minor Upanishads that Georg Hegel, the German philosopher of the late Enlightenment, referred to as he presented Brahman in Indian philosophy in his scholarship. He wrote, The Atharvasiras Upanishad has been an important text in the Pashupata Shaivism tradition and the Nath Yogi movement founded by Gorakhnath. It contains the vow of those who enter monastic life in these traditions.George Weston Briggs (2009), GorakhnƒÅth and the KƒÅnpha·π≠a Yogƒ´s, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 218-219 See also *Kaivalya Upanishad References Bibliography   * Category:Upanishads Category:Sanskrit texts ","title":"Atharvashiras Upanishad"},{"id":"45195698","text":"Zuzana Brabcov√° (23 March 1959 ‚Äì 20 August 2015) was a Czech writer.

Early life  William Mostyn was born 1742, the eldest son of William Mostyn of Bryngwyn, and his wife Grace Wynn, daughter of Robert Wynn of Plas Newydd.Thomas (1964b) He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1761, and studied law at the Middle Temple, where he was admitted in 1759.Foster (1887), p. 992 He later succeeded to the estate in Woodhouse, Shropshire, of his cousin, John Lloyd Owen, and thereafter took the name Owen.  Career  Until the early 1770s, the two main families in Montgomeryshire were the Wynns of Wynnstay and the Herberts of Powis Castle.Thomas (1964a) Up to 1772, the families were allied in their agreement over whom to return as the county's single Member of Parliament; Edward Kynaston was their choice, but he died in 1772, followed by Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis. The Wynns appointed one of their kin, Watkin Williams, after Kynaston's death, but at the 1774 election, the Dowager Lady Powis nominated Owen as the Herbert candidate, in opposition to Williams. A long contest followed, and Owen received the support of the smaller land-owners, whilst Williams gained the backing of the most substantial ones; in the end the Herberts contributed the most money and Owen won the election. In Parliament, despite initially voting with Frederick North, Lord North, he switched to the opposition for the rest of his premiership. This upset Lord Powis, who supported the government, but at the 1780 election, the Wynns, who were opposition supporters, backed Owen and he was re-elected unopposed; the same was true for 1784. During the 1780s, he again voted with the opposition for the most part and opposed William Pitt the Younger throughout his premiership. He was considered a Portland Whig by 1792, but his ill health caused his attendance to decline, and he died on 11 March 1795. He was never recorded speaking in the house.Thorne (1986b)  Personal life  He married Rebecca Dod, daughter of Thomas Dod of Edge, Cheshire ( 1688‚Äì1759).Burke (1871), p. 1037Burke (1838), p. 551 With her, he had the following issue: * William Mostyn Owen (died 1849), who succeeded to his father's estates, and who married Harriet Elizabeth Cumming, eldest daughter of Major T.

It is handled by the South Central Railway (SCR). The train was announced in the 2014 Annual Railway Budget of India and it uses the rake of Secunderabad ‚Äì Shalimar Express. The train stops at 13 stations en route, connecting major cities like Warangal, Vijayawada, Eluru and Rajahmundry. The train runs weekly and is the first LHB AC train to be introduced on this route. The train was flagged off from Secunderabad on at 11:15 am on 19 January 2015 by Minister of State of Railways Suresh Prabhu. The locomotive links for this train have not been fixed yet but often the train is hauled by a Lallaguda based WAP 7 or WAP 4 locomotive between Secunderabad and Visakhapatnam. Overview Since the train is fully air-conditioned, it has no unreserved coaches. It has 11 third AC, three second AC and one first class coaches. Along with two generator cars, it has 17 coaches in total. The train has no pantry car and offers no catering. The up train departs Secunderabad every Saturday at 17:55 and arrives at Visakhapatnam every Sunday at 06:50. The down train departs Visakhapatnam every Sunday at 19:00 and arrives at Secunderabad every Monday at 07:40. The train runs with an average speed of and has a rake reversal at Vijayawada. Technical The train is equipped with LHB coaches. They are considered to be \\"anti-telescopic\\", which means they do not get turned over, if the train derails or gets involved in a collision. These coaches are made of stainless steel and the interiors are made of aluminium which make them lighter as compared to conventional rakes. Each coach also has an \\"advanced pneumatic disc brake system\\" for efficient braking at higher speeds, \\"modular interiors\\" that integrate lighting into ceiling and luggage racks with wider windows. The improved suspension system of LHB coaches ensures more riding comfort for the passengers compared to conventional rakes. The air conditioning system of the LHB coaches is of higher capacity compared to the older rakes and is controlled by a microprocessor which is said to give passengers better comfort than the older coaches during summer and winter seasons. They are relatively quieter as each coach can produce a maximum noise level of 60 decibels while conventional coaches can produce 100 decibels. Each LHB coach costs between Rs 15 million to 20 million, whereas the power car which houses a generator costs about 30 million.

It forms the conclusion of Reynolds' Poseidon's Children future history trilogy, which follows the expansion of humanity and its transhuman descendants into the galaxy over the course of many centuries. Poseidon's Wake follows Blue Remembered Earth (2012) and On the Steel Breeze (2013), and was published by Gollancz on 30 April 2015. Background Reynolds submitted the manuscript of Poseidon's Wake to Gollancz in October 2014, and completed his editorial revisions in November 2014. Gollancz released the novel's cover art and announced its print and digital release date in January 2015. Plot introduction Poseidon's Wake is a loose sequel to Reynolds' 2013 novel On the Steel Breeze, featuring numerous recurring characters, but can also be considered a stand-alone story. Set in the distant future, after humans have travelled to other stars and encountered mysterious robotic aliens known as Watchkeepers, the novel depicts an expedition by interstellar colonists to a mysterious solar system which contains an ancient and devastating secret. Reception Erlingur Einarsson of SciFiNow gave Poseidon's Wake a highly favourable review, describing it as \\"grand, involving and full of light and wonder\\" and naming it \\"one of the best sci-fi novels of the year\\", while acknowledging that it was more slow-paced than other science fiction works. Eric Brown of The Guardian also reviewed the novel favourably, calling it \\"a well-paced, complex story replete with intrigue, invention and an optimism uncommon in contemporary SF\\". Mark Diston of The Register was far more critical of the novel, describing it as \\"pedestrian, long-winded and ineffective\\" and saying that Reynolds' characters lack \\"life [and] humour\\".

He is a former president of the Indian Academy of Sciences (2007-2010) and is the incumbent the chairman of the Biotechnology Advisory Council of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. A former secretary general of The World Academy of Sciences, he has served as the project coordinator of Translational Centre in Eye Diseases of Champalimaud Foundation (C-TRACER) and the Affordable Healthcare Project of the Wellcome Trust for finding solutions for the use of scaffolds for cultivating stem cells. He is a former member of the International Human Rights Network of Academies and Scholarly Societies, the International Basic Sciences Panel of UNESCO and the International Chapter Affiliate Committee of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), United States. He has also served as an editorial board member of several international journals. Legacy Cataract in human eye Ginko tree Withania Balasubramanian started his research activities in 1965 focusing on the structure and functions of proteins and polypeptides and worked on the thermodynamic analysis of their stability. The focus of his research changed in 1984/85 when he started to work on ocular science and concentrated on crystallins of eye lens and their function as an agent in keeping the lens transparent. His research revealed how cataract is caused when crystallins are damaged photochemically, thereby leading to diminished lenticular transparency. He argued that the oxidative stress on the lens induces covalent chemical changes in the constituent molecules and these changes lead to cataract. He researched further on the subject to find out that, by supplementing antioxidants and cytoprotective substances, the progression of cataract can be slowed down. These findings are known to have introduced a prophylactic approach to addressing the issue of cataract, which is reported to be the causal factor for 47.9 percent of the blindness in the world. Further, he attempted to identify the cataractostatic agents and proposed the benefits of tea polyphenols, Ginko Biloba and Withania somnifera extracts. These substances contained antioxidants and cytoprotective compounds which slow down the progression of oxidative cataract and this was verified during experiments in animals. Advanced vision loss from Glaucoma. After the turn of the century, Balasubramanian and his colleagues started working on inherited eye diseases and their molecular genetics. The group carried out research on diseases such as congenital glaucoma with a sampling set of over 400 families and this has helped in revealing 15 mutations in the gene CYP1B1, with mutation R368H being the most common one. The research has also recorded the genotype-phenotype correlations and the structural changes occur in mutated protein and these findings have assisted in clinical prediction of the disease and in early therapeutic intervention to avert blindness. Balasubramanian is now working on stem cell biology and its use in restoring lost vision. He and his group have been successful in isolating the adult stem cells found in the limbus, around the cornea, and culturing them on human amniotic membrane. These cultured stem cells were, later, used to produce corneal epithelia that can be stitched on to human eye. Clinical tests on 200 patients who lost eyesight due to chemical or fire burns returned significantly good results with vision restoration to 20/20 levels, with or without subsequent corneal grafts or transplantation. These tests are reported to be the largest successful human trial of adult stem cell therapy in the world. Balasubramanian has published 6 books of which two books, one on chemistry and the other in biotechnology, are prescribed text books for academic studies. He is credited with over 450 articles, published in peer reviewed national and international journals and Microsoft Academic Search, an online repository of scientific articles, has listed 52 of them. He has presented more than 170 scientific papers and has contributed in popularizing science by writing columns in leading newspapers such as The Hindu and The Times of India since 1980. On the academic front, he has assisted 16 doctoral students in their PhD studies. His efforts are also reported behind the establishment of a vaccine unit at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and in designing a quality improvement program for the Sericulture Laboratory of the state government.

Sired by Galileo out of the mare Red Evie, she represents the Coolmore Stud organisation and is trained by Aidan O'Brien. In 2014 she won a strong maiden race on her debut and then finished third in the Moyglare Stud Stakes before winning the Prix Marcel Boussac. She was rated the equal-best two-year-old filly to race in Europe in 2014. In 2015 she finished second in her first three starts (including the Irish 1,000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes) before winning the Royal Whip Stakes. She then finished second in the Irish Champion Stakes, ninth in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and second in the Champion Stakes. She ended her season by becoming the first three-year-old filly to win the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland. At four she won the Mooresbridge Stakes and finished second in the Tattersalls Gold Cup, Coronation Cup, Prince of Wales's Stakes, Yorkshire Oaks and Irish Champion Stakes before winning the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. In her last two races she finished second in the Champion Stakes and third in the Breeders' Cup Turf. Background Found is a bay filly with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by Roncon, Wynatt & Chelston, a group associated with the Coolmore Stud organisation. She was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland five times. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle and Ruler of the World. Found is the fourth foal produced by Red Evie, a top-class racemare whose wins included the Lockinge Stakes. Red Evie was a descendant of Time and Chance, a mare who produced the Ascot Gold Cup winner Random Shot. Like most of the Coolmore horses, Found was entered into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. She is owned in partnership by Michael Tabor, Sue Magnier and Derrick Smith. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= Found made her racecourse debut in a one-mile maiden race at the Curragh Racecourse on 23 August 2014. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, she started a 14/1 outsider and was regarded as Ballydoyle's second string behind Together Forever, who started 11/10 favourite under her trainer's son Joseph O'Brien. The leading Irish trainers John Oxx, Dermot Weld, Johnny Murtagh and Jim Bolger also had representatives in the fifteen runner field. Found started slowly but moved up through the field to take third place a furlong from the finish. She accelerated in the closing stages to take the lead 100 yards from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by three quarters of a length from Together Forever. The runner-up went on to win the Group One Fillies' Mile in October. Joseph O'Brien took over the ride on Found when the filly was moved up in class and dropped in distance for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 14 September. In a field of ten fillies she started the 7/2 second favourite behind the British-trained Cursory Glance who had won the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot before finishing second to Tiggy Wiggy in the Lowther Stakes. She again started slowly but made progress in the straight despite drifting left and right under pressure. She took third place in the final furlong but was unable to reach the lead and finished third, beaten a neck and half a length by Cursory Glance and the Jim Bolger-trained Lucida. O'Brien later described her performance as \\"a lovely run... she was a little bit green... it happened a little bit quick for her\\". Three weeks after her defeat at the Curragh, Found was sent to France for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by Ryan Moore she was made the 9/4 favourite against eleven opponents. Her main opponents appeared to be the Prix de Cabourg winner Ervedya from France, the Silver Flash Stakes winner Jack Naylor (a filly despite her masculine name) from Ireland and the Prestige Stakes winner Malabar from England, whilst the other runners included Shahah (Prix d'Aumale) and Queen Bee (Prix du Calvados). Found started well but was settled in mid-division as first Ervedya, then Thank You Bye Bye set the pace. Ervedya regained the lead in the straight but Moore produced Found with a strong late run to overtake the French filly 100 metres from the finish before drawing away to win by two and a half lengths. Jack Naylor took third ahead of Malabar and Queen Bee. After the race, O'Brien said of the winner \\"She is a lovely big filly, with a temperament to match, and I would think she will have no trouble getting a mile and a quarter and maybe a mile and a half, as she is by Galileo. Along with that she has plenty of natural pace, certainly enough to be a Guineas filly... She's a very exciting filly\\" Bookmakers responded to her performance by making her the ante-post favourite for both the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks Stakes. =2015: three-year-old season= Spring Found maintained her position at the head of the market for the 1000 Guineas on 3 May but ten days before the race O'Brien announced that she was not a certain starter in the race after her preparation had been interrupted by illness. She was withdrawn from the race on 1 May. A day after the 1000 was run, Found reappeared against apparently less- challenging opposition in the Group Three Athasi Stakes at the Curragh. Starting odds-on favourite she took the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken and beaten two lengths by the four-year-old Iveagh Gardens. On 24 May Found started the 5/4 favourite in an eighteen-runner field for the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh. After struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight she finished strongly but failed by half a length to overhaul the Jim Bolger-trained Pleascach. Summer Found was entered in The Oaks and a supplementary entry in The Derby was also considered, but she missed the Epsom meeting to reappear in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot She started favourite ahead of a field which included Lucida and the French-trained Ervedya the winner of the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. She took the lead approaching the final furlong but was caught in the final strides and was beaten a neck by Ervedya. After three consecutive second places, the filly was given a two-month break before being stepped up in distance for the Royal Whip Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 23 August. Ridden by Heffernan, she took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away to win easily by four lengths from the four-year-old colt Answered. Autumn On 12 September Found was stepped back up to Group One level for the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown. Starting the 6/1 third favourite in a top-class field she finished strongly to finish second, a length behind Golden Horn and ahead of Free Eagle, Pleascach, Highland Reel, The Grey Gatsby and Cirrus des Aigles. In October, a year after her win in the Prix Marcel Boussac the filly was sent to France to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp. After racing on the inside she was bumped when Ryan Moore attempted to move her out to obtain a clear run in the straight. She finished ninth of the seventeen runners, five lengths behind the winner Golden Horn. Two weeks after her run in the Arc, Found contested the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Ascot and started the 9/2 second favourite behind Golden Horn's stablemate Jack Hobbs. She was restrained by Moore at the rear of the field and was still last of the thirteen runners entering the straight. She then made rapid progress on the inside overtook Jack Hobbs in the final furlong and finished second, one and a quarter lengths behind the winner Fascinating Rock. O'Brien commented \\"I am delighted with her run, she ran a great race. Ryan let her relax and she came home very well. We can look forward to her for next year, I would hope she will stay in training\\". On her final appearance of the season, Found was sent to Kentucky to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland on 31 October. Ridden by Moore she was the only female in the twelve-runner field and started the 6.4/1 fourth choice in the betting. Golden Horn was made the odds-on favourite ahead of the seven-year-old Big Blue Kitten (Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes, Sword Dancer Invitational Handicap) and the six-year-old The Pizza Man (Arlington Million) whilst the other runners included Red Rifle (Bowling Green Handicap), Twilight Eclipse (Man o' War Stakes) and Slumber (Manhattan Handicap). The outsider Shining Copper, acting as a pacemaker or \\"rabbit\\" for his stable companions Big Blue Kitten and Slumber, took the lead soon after the start and opened up a long lead with Found being positioned just behind the leaders of the chasing group. On the final turn Shining Copper gave way to Golden Horn but Found was close behind and moved up to challenge the favourite as Big Blue Kitten began to make rapid progress from the rear. Found gained a narrow advantage 150 yards from the finish and won by half a length from Golden Horn with Big Blue Kitten three quarters of a length away in third. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"She came out of her races well, and everything was going well with her, so we tried this. She's an amazing filly\\". =2016: four-year-old season= Spring On her first appearance as a four-year-old, Found started the 9/10 favourite for the Listed Alleged Stakes at the Curragh on 3 April. After tracking the leaders she began to struggle on the heavy ground and finished third of the five runners behind Zhukova and Success Days. O'Brien said that \\"she was a bit fresh and keen and just got tired on the ground. She'll be fine though.\\" Over the same course and distance a month later, the filly was matched against Fascinating Rock and three others in the Group Three Mooresbridge Stakes. After being restrained by Moore she struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight before squeezing through a narrow gap in the final furlong and winning by a length and a quarter from Success Days with Fascinating Rock in third. Three weeks later she started 8/15 favourite for the Tattersalls Gold Cup but was beaten into second place by Fascinating Rock. Summer On 4 June Found was sent to England for the Coronation Cup at Epsom and started second favourite behind the five-year-old Postponed in a race which also included Simple Verse and Arabian Queen. After being restrained in the early stages she finished strongly and finished second, four and a half lengths behind Postponed. At Royal Ascot Found was brought back in distance for the Prince of Wales's Stakes and started second favourite behind the Japanese horse A Shin Hikari. She took the lead from the favourite in the straight but was overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten a neck by the 16/1 outsider My Dream Boat. After a break of over two months, Found returned to the track in August and started 2/1 favourite or the Yorkshire Oaks over one and a half miles at York Racecourse. Ridden by Heffernan she made progress from the back of the field in the straight but was unable to get on terms with her younger stablemate Seventh Heaven and was beaten almost three lengths into second place. Autumn On 10 September Found ran for the second time in the Irish Champion Stakes and started 7/1 joint third favourite behind Harzand and Minding in a twelve-runner field which also included Almanzor, New Bay, Highland Reel and Hawkbill. In this race she was ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori After racing towards the rear of the field she accelerated into the lead in the final furlong but was caught in the closing strides and beaten three quarters of a length by Almanzor. On 2 October Found ran for the second time in the Prix de l'Arc de Tromphe in which she was ridden by Moore and started at odds of 9.6/1. Her fifteen opponents included Postponed, Order of St George, Harzand, Makahiki, Highland Reel, New Bay, The Grey Gatsby and Left Hand (Prix Vermeille). After racing in mid-division she made rapid progress early in the straight, took the lead 400 metres out and ran on well to win by one and three quarter lengths from her stable companion Highland Reel, with Order of St George completing a 1-2-3 for Ballydoyle in third. After the race Moore said \\"She's been frustrating sometimes but this has probably been the main aim all year. She was back to a mile and a half in an evenly run race and she showed what she's capable of. At her best she's a very hard filly to beat.\\" O'Brien recalled \\"When Ryan rode her as a two-year-old, he said she could win an Arc and he was right\\". Two weeks after her Arc victory Found started 5/2 second favourite in her second attempt to win the Champion Stakes at Ascot. After being held up in the early stages she stayed on strongly in the closing stages to finish second, two lengths behind the favourite Almanzor. On 5 November she was sent to Santa Anita Park in California to attempt to repeat her 2015 victory in the Breeders' Cup Turf and started the 3.6/1 second choice in the betting behind Flintshire. After stumbling at the start she kept on well in the straight to finish third of the twelve runners, four lengths behind her stablemate Highland Reel. Assessment and awards In the International Classification for 2014 Found was ranked the equal-best two-year-old filly to race in Europe, level with Tiggy Wiggy and two pounds behind the top colt Belardo. In the 2015 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Found was rated the best three-year-old filly in the world and the forty-second best horse of any age or sex. On 8 November 2016 Found was named Champion Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards. In the 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Found was given a rating of 124, making her the 8th best racehorse in the world, the top-rated horse in Ireland and the best female racehorse in Europe.

Along with a group of followers, Rsi Markaneya was magnetically attracted to a destination located in the central foothills of the island that radiated light and energy. This place was Campuhan in Ubud at a junction in the Wos River and it was here that he felt compelled to build a temple by the name of Pura Gunung Lebah. On subsequent expeditions around Bali, Rsi Markaneya built a number of other significant temples and created a shared irrigation system for the terraced landscape that is still practiced by farmers today. The formation of the banjar, which is a village council responsible for community and religious affairs, was also inspired by this holy man. In essence, it can be said that Rsi Markaneya is responsible for the foundation of Balinese Hinduism in its purest form referred to as Agama Tirta or the religion of holy water. Since being discovered back in the 8th century, the area of Campuhan has always been highly regarded by the Balinese for its immense spiritual powers. Even the term Ubud is derived from the term ubad, meaning medicine in reference to the traditional healing properties of the array of plants that randomly grow here. Generations of Hindu worshippers have made special pilgrimages to the fork in the Wos River to mediate, bathe and collect holy water for temple ceremonies and cleansing rituals. There had always been ties between Java and Bali, but it was the disintegration of the once mighty Majapahit kingdom in the 15th century that saw a mass exodus of nobles to Bali. A new kingdom on the island's east coast called Gelgel was consequently established and gave sanctuary to many important ruling families. They brought with them an artistic legacy and the principles of the caste system. By the 17th century Bali invariably experienced a rapid emergence of new kingdoms, including the founding of several royal houses in Ubud. However, this period also saw much conflict between the royal clans with supremacy as the ultimate goal. A prince from Klungkung was sent to create a palace in Sukawati as a centre of great power and aesthetic beauty. Artisans came from all over Bali to help in its construction and once completed many of them chose to stay. Sukawati today is a community that strongly supports all forms of artistry as well as dance and music. With the successful establishment of a reigning authority in Sukawati, palace retainers were then sent in the late 1700s to secure the area of Ubud. A pair of cousins formed rival communities in Padang Tegal and further north in the area of Taman. Following subsequent fighting between these neighbouring villages the king of Sukawati sent his brothers Tjokorde Ngurah Tabanan to Peliatan and Tjokorde Tangkeban to Sambahan to establish palaces with the notion to control these troubled areas.

History The Wendel 1 pit was closed in 1989, Wendel 2 in 1992 and Wendel 3 in 2001. The first piece of coal was mined in Petite- Rosselle in June 1856, at the Saint-Charles pit. These pits are in France but surrounded on three sides by the national border with Germany. Several pits were dug between 1862 and 1889: Wendel 1, Wendel 2, Vuillemin 1 and Vuillemin 2. Emile Vuillemin was the consulting engineer for Charles de Wendel and Georges Hainguerlot's company- Compagnie Anonyme des Mines de Stiring. The coal produced was primarily used to fire the Wendel steelworks. The company became - Les Petits-fils de Fran√ßois de Wendel et Cie in 1889. After the Second World War, the government required the industry to triple the Lorraine coal production within ten years. In the 1946 nationalising, the Wendel assets were assigned to public company Houill√®res du bassin de Lorraine. The Wendel 3 pit was dug in 1952, and in 1958 was equipped with the new wash house 3. The Wendel 1 and 2 pits were modernised and equipped with new headframes. After 1960, the coal recession hit: the company modernised wash house 1-2 in 1962 by creating a new module on top of the former wash house, adapted to the existing equipment. Operations and investment continued up until 1986 when central activities ceased. Some infrastructure continued to be used up until 1989 serving other pits in the Wendel franchise.

He is an author and poet. He started working in the civil service in 1995 and held several positions until he became head of the Crown Prince's Court, replacing his father Abdulaziz al-Tuwaijri in early 2005. On his ascension, King Abdullah appointed him Chief of the Royal Court on 9 October 2005, replacing another commoner, Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Nuweisir, and secretary general of the Allegiance Council. In 2011 he cemented his power by replacing Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd as chief of the Cabinet Court as well. As the secretary general, he had a say in the staffing of all the monarchy's positions. Over time, he also became Chief of the Royal Guard and a few other court positions. By the time of the King's death, al-Tuwaijri was deeply unpopular with the senior princes, who described him as the \\"octopus,\\" the \\"head of corruption,\\"\\"the black box\\" and the \\"patron of the secularists\\". He was also accused of seeking to \\"destroy the country and run the Royal Family.\\" In fact, Prince Mish'al, the eldest brother of the King, used to refer to al- Tuwaijri as 'King Khalid' because of his influence in the Royal Court. Al- Tuwaijri was also denounced as the prime leader of the \\"westernization project\\" in Saudi Arabia, and was accused of trying to \\"shield\\" the king by preventing most of the Royal Family members from meeting him. Several media sources reported the disappearance of al-Tuwaijri as soon as King Abdullah died, and many believed his removal was in effect defeat of the liberal faction led by the late King and his son Miteb, Minister of the National Guard, and a candidate for deputy crown prince.

Its centerpiece is an early 19th-century Cape, set on a parcel of land owned until 1810 by the granddaughter of the island's original French proprietor, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac. The property was transformed in the early 20th century into a summer estate, with the addition of a Colonial Revival wing and a walled garden. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description Cover Farm consists of of land, facing Frenchman Bay in the Hulls Cove area of Bar Harbor. The main house is located at the end of Cover Farm Road, a private road extending westward from Maine State Route 3. Its main block is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape, five bays wide, covered in wood shingles, with a central chimney and a granite foundation. A long gambrel- roofed wing extends to the north, and a gable-roofed wing extends to the west (rear) of the main house. The main entrance is framed by a Greek Revival surround. South of the house stands a formal walled garden. The history of the property has its roots in the early settlement of Mount Desert Island, whose first acknowledged European proprietor was Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac (for whom Cadillac Mountain is named). Following British conquest of the area in the French and Indian War, the island was granted to Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard. The island was seized by the state of Massachusetts (which present-day Maine was then part of) in the American Revolutionary War, since Bernard was a Loyalist. Bernard's son John, however, had sided with the rebel cause, and both he and Cadillac's granddaughter Marie Therese de Gregoire filed claims for the land. These claims were adjudicated by granting John Bernard the western half of the island, and de Gregoire the eastern half. Although de Gregoire family tradition claims that this house was built by them, documentary and architectural evidence suggests this house was built after they sold the property on which this house stands in 1806. It was more likely built by the Cutlers, who owned the property from 1810 to 1834. The Greek Revival treatments were probably added by the next owners, the Peaches. The next significant owner was Mrs. Olive Tilton, who acquired the property in 1917. She was responsible for adding the gambrel-roofed wing and the walled garden, marking the property's transformation from a farm to a summer residence. She also gave the property its current name.

He served as the Bishop of San Miniato from 1897 until his resignation one decade later. The bishop served as a humble pastor though reluctant as he was to accept his episcopal appointment while even protesting against an idea to elevate him into the cardinalate. He exercised his duties until his serious ill health forced him to resign from his see though was given a ceremonial position since Pope Pius X did not wish to relieve him of all his episcopal duties and functions. He was cleared for beatification in late 2014 after a miracle was found to have been attributed to his intercession. His beatification took place on 19 September 2015 in San Miniato; Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the celebration on the behalf of Pope Francis. Life Alberto del Corona was born on 5 July 1837 to Giuseppe del Corona and Ester Bucalossi (d. 1839) as their fourth and final child; his parents served as humble footwear retailers. He was baptized on 8 July in the Siena cathedral in the names of \\"Alberto Francesco Filomeno\\". One sibling was his sister Teresa. His parents often called him \\"Albertino\\" as an affectionate name. He felt a deep religious calling while he was a child and informed his parents of his decision to respond to this vocation in 1854. It is known that he spent some time of his childhood in Tremoleto and that he studied under the Barnabites at the Collegio di San Sebastiano. He made his First Communion on 16 April 1851 in a Barnabite church. He first entered a convent of the Order of Preachers on 4 December 1854 after pleading with his father to do so and he received his habit at 4:00pm on 1 February 1855 after the Vespers recitation; he became a professed member of that order on 3 November 1859. He was later ordained to the priesthood on 5 February 1860 in the church of Saint Mark and he assumed the religious name of \\"Pio\\"; he celebrated his first Mass on the following 12 February. Del Corona - along with Pia Elena Bruzzi Bonaguidi (whom he first met in 1869) - was received in private audience to meet Pope Pius IX on 8 May 1872 and from him received his blessing and encouragement of his work. He was granted the pontiff's personal imprimatur to found the \\"Asilo\\" of Bolognese as well as his own religious congregation. In 1872 he was appointed as the prior of the convent of San Marco and held that position until 1874. He founded the Suore Domenicane dello Spirito Santo in 1872 while in San Miniato culminating the work that he began almost a decade prior. Pius IX appointed him in 1874 as the Coadjutor Bishop of San Miniato and Pope Leo XIII appointed him as the Bishop of San Miniato in 1897 after the death of the-then bishop despite his great reluctance. Del Corona received his episcopal consecration on 3 January 1875 from Costantino Patrizi Naro in the Saint Apollinaris church. In 1899 he was made an Assistant to the Pontifical Throne which made him a Monsignor. Del Corona used an iron chain as a penitential belt and he often used a whip to lash himself. His most prized possession was an episcopal ring with a topaz that Pius IX had given him in 1874. In 1897 he was present in Florence for the opening of the casket of Antoninus of Florence and removed the ring from the Antonninus's finger while replacing it with that of the one the pope had given him. On 17 April 1899 he was in Rome when he had learned of the death of his fellow Dominican - and the Cardinal Archbishop of Florence - Agostino Bausa. The pope received him in a private audience soon afterwards and suggested to him that he become the new archbishop and then be named as a cardinal. But he was horrified and protested against the idea though was later relieved when the pope decided to appoint another to the position. The bishop decided to retire from the position in 1906 due to his serious ill health (on 4 August 1906 he was diagnosed with liver disease and was near-blind as well) however Pope Pius X refused to remove him from his episcopal duties in full and instead appointed the Cardinal Archbishop of Pisa Pietro Maffi as the apostolic administrator on 14 September until he could find a replacement; he settled on the latter in 1907 which legitimized his resignation. But Pius X still did not wish to remove the bishop from his episcopal duties so appointed him as the Titular Archbishop of Sardica which would be a ceremonial position in nature while raising him to the rank of archbishop. In 1910 the pope sent to him a personal and handwritten letter to him imparting to the archbishop his apostolic blessing due to it being the half-centennial of his ordination. Pio Alberto del Corona c. 1875. He fell ill and on 10 August 1912 received the last rites. Pius X also sent his blessing to him when he learned of his illness. He died at dawn on the Feast of the Assumption looking outside the window. He was buried in Florence in the Cimitero della Misericordia where his tomb soon became one of pilgrimage for the faithful. His remains were later transferred on 12 October 1925 and exhumed in 2001 for canonical inspection in the presence of Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins as well as four bishops and fifteen priests. =Views of contemporaries= His contemporaries of the age all held the late archbishop in great esteem. Pope Leo XIII once said that \\"he is one of the most learned and holy prelates of the Church\\". Pius X once held a private audience with the Dominican bishop Ludovico Ferretti and advised that the bishop \\"take good care of him, you know! That one is a saint!\\" The Cardinal Archbishop of Florence Ermenegildo Florit said that he was a \\"good and faithful disciple of Saint Dominic.\\" Beatification Pio Alberto del Corona (seated left) in 1908 with Hyacinthe-Marie Cormier (seated middle). The cause for his beatification commenced in 1941 in both Florence and San Miniato which saw the late archbishop titled as a Servant of God; this process closed in 1959 at which stage theologians examined and approved his spiritual writings on 3 December 1971 (writings possessing no doctrinal errors). But the cause remained dormant for sometime before it was reactivated and a diocesan process was held from 2000 until 28 August 2002; documents from that and the informative process were sent to officials in the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 4 September 2002. The C.C.S. validated these processes on 4 June 2004 and received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 2007. Theologians advising the C.C.S. approved the cause on 5 October 2012 while the C.C.S. themselves likewise approved it on 1 October 2013. The cause culminated on 9 October 2013 when Pope Francis declared him to have lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue and named him to be Venerable. The archbishop's beatification depended upon a miracle attributed to his intercession and it needed recognition for beatification to occur. One such case was investigated (and received C.C.S. validation on 24 February 2007) but could not be investigated further in Rome until he had been named as Venerable. Once that occurred the miracle was examined and received approval from medical experts on 28 November 2013 while theologians also approved it on 29 April 2014. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. also approved this miracle on 16 September 2014. The pope confirmed this healing to be a legitimate miracle on 17 September 2014 which would enable for him to be beatified. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the celebration on the pope's behalf on 19 September 2015 in San Miniato. The current postulator for this cause is the Dominican priest Gianni Festa.

Lindenmann, together with his colleague, the British virologist Alick Isaacs, co-discovered and identified interferon in 1957 through their research at the National Institute for Medical Research. Interferon, a group of proteins involved in immune regulation and defence against viruses, is now used to treat a variety of conditions, including hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, and some cancers. Early life and education Lindenmann was born on September 18, 1924, in Zagreb, Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia), to a Swiss father and a French mother from Paris. The family moved from Yugoslavia to Zurich, Switzerland when Lindenmann was a few years old. His medical degree was from Zurich in 1951; he did postgraduate research at the Institute of Hygiene of the University of Zurich.Lyall J. Jean Lindenmann (1924‚Äì2015).

Career Lindenmann gained a fellowship from the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences to do postdoctoral research at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in London, UK (1956‚Äì57), where he worked with Alick Isaacs. Lindenmann returned to the Institute of Hygiene in 1957, and spent most of the remainder of his career at the University of Zurich, retiring in 1992. He also held a position at the Federal Office of Public Health, Bern (1960‚Äì62), as well as a visiting professorship at the University of Florida, Gainesville, USA, where he worked with George Gifford.Gresser I. (1987) The Man Who Studied Interferon Without Really Trying. Journal of Interferon Research 7: 445‚Äì49 Interferon research While working together at the NIMR, Lindenmann and Isaacs noticed that if they killed viruses using heat and applied the dead viruses to living cells, those cells became resistant to further infections from live viruses. In 1957, Lindenmann and Isaacs discovered that the cells exposed to the dead viruses secreted a previously unknown substance which blocked future viral infections, which became known as interferon. It was later found that interferons are too toxic for use as general antiviral drugs, but they are used to treat hepatitis C as well as some types of cancer. Lindenmann later returned to the University of Zurich to conduct further research on interferon and its potential uses. With Otto Haller and others, he studied why Mx+ laboratory mice were resistant to influenza, while Mx‚Äì mice died from the virus.De Maeyer E, De Maeyer-Guignard J. (1987) You Cannot Get Away from Interferon. Journal of Interferon Research 7: 467‚Äì70 Lindenmann discovered that interferons acted indirectly to protect resistant mice by switching on a gene which produces a particular protein to defend against influenza. The Journal of Interferon Research published a special edition dedicated to Lindenmann in October 1987 to mark the 30th anniversary of the discovery of interferon. In the commemorative issue, the journal's then editor-in-chief, Charles Weissmann, wrote of Lindenmann, \\"Not many scientists have the satisfaction of laying the foundations for a new field of research, and not only living to see its successful evolution but also contributing significantly, time and again, to its development.\\"Weissmann C.

He was educated at Woodhouse Grove School, Bedford Modern School and King's College London. Career Following university, Carter moved briefly to France before returning to become an underwriter at Lloyd's of London in 1863. In January 1871, Carter emigrated to Brisbane, Australia by the Light Brigade. Soon after his arrival in Brisbane, Carter joined the merchants J. & G. Harris where he remained until 1876. He ‚Äòbecame Brisbane manager of the Adelaide Milling & Mercantile Co., and held directorships in Millaquin Sugar Co., John Hicks & Co., Dath Henderson & Co. and J. Leutenegger Limited, and was chairman of directors of E. Rich & Co. Limited and of Queensland Trustees Limited. He was also agent for several overseas insurance companies‚Äô. Consulships and wider interests Following in the footsteps of the Queensland politician George Harris, Carter became Vice-Consul for Sweden and Norway, consular agent for France in 1902 and Consul for Norway in 1906. He was ‚ÄòPresident of the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce for five terms (1898-1906), and was active in the Immigration League of Queensland, the Committee of Fire Underwriters, the Marine Board, the Brisbane and South Brisbane fire brigades, the General Hospital, the Technical College, and the State committee for the selection of Rhodes Scholars‚Äô. Carter was a foundation member of the Johnsonian Club, a member of the Queensland Club and an active Freemason. Increasingly political, Carter became involved in many issues ‚Äòwriting frequently to the press on defence, port facilities and bimetallism and was an energetic and effective lobbyist‚Äô. Described as ‚Äòportly, urbane and genial, a kindly employer, popular and respected‚Äô, Carter unwittingly became the quasi leader of Brisbane's commercial community. Politics Carter was a ‚Äòliberal, a free trader and one of the few ardent Federationists in Brisbane commerce‚Äô. As a leader of the Federation League he visited Sydney for the June 1899 referendum and represented Queensland at the free-trade conference that was held there in February 1900. Carter was subsequently appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council in July 1901 where he spoke rarely but attended regularly. When the T. J. Ryan government in 1915 proposed amendment of the Workers' Compensation Act to give the State Government Insurance Office a monopoly, ‚ÄòCarter was a leading opponent on behalf of private insurance interests‚Äô. The council amended the bill to remove the monopoly but ‚ÄòCarter's failure to secure a consequential amendment negated the victory‚Äô. Following that defeat, Carter only spoke once more in the council, on an insurance bill in December 1916. Honours Carter was made an officer of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1911 and in 1912 received the Norwegian Order of St Olav. Family life Carter married Jane Nodes in London in February 1867. Tragically, his wife died in May 1871, leaving him with three young sons; on 9 November 1872 he married a widow Frances Eliza Elgin Koch (n√©e Johnson). Carter died on 4 November 1917 at his home at Kangaroo Point and was buried in South Brisbane Cemetery.Carter Arthur J -- Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 17 February 2015. He was survived by his wife and their five children, and by one son of his first marriage. He is commemorated by a plaque in St Mary's Anglican Church, Kangaroo Point, where he was a churchwarden.

Background  The appellant, Kevin Fearon, and an accomplice robbed a jewelry merchant and fled in a black getaway vehicle. A police investigation resulted in Fearon's arrest that night. At the time of Fearon's arrest, police had not yet recovered the handgun Fearon used to commit the robbery or the jewelry he stole. Police conducted a pat-down search of Fearon incident to arrest and, discovering an unlocked, unencrypted cell phone on his person, searched the phone. The arresting officer did not have a warrant to search the phone at that time. The search revealed, inter alia, a draft text message reading ‚ÄúWe did it were the jewelry at nigga burrrrrrrrrrr‚Äù and a photograph of a handgun that matched a handgun later recovered by police. Fearon was charged with robbery with a firearm and related offences. Police obtained a warrant to search the phone several months after Fearon's arrest but did not uncover any new evidence.  The courts below  At trial, Fearon argued that the police search of his cell phone incident to arrest was unconstitutional, violating section 8 of the Charter, and moved for the evidence to be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter. The trial judge convicted Fearon of robbery with a firearm, holding that the police had a \\"reasonable prospect of securing evidence of the offence for which [Fearon] was being arrested\\"ONCJ, par. 44 and that the information stored in the cell phone, while private, was not \\"so connected to the dignity of the person\\"ONCJ, par. 51 to limit the police's common-law power of search incident to arrest. The trial judge admitted the evidence found on the cell phone, finding that its exclusion would undermine the judicial system. The Ontario Court of Appeal, agreeing to hear Fearon's appeal, unanimously upheld the conviction in a decision written by Justice Armstrong, holding that a cursory cell phone search fell within the common-law doctrine of search incident to arrest set out in R v Caslake.ONCA, par. 73 Fearon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  Judgment of the SCC  The Supreme Court dismissed Fearon's appeal in a 4‚Äì3 decision. All seven justices of the Court agreed that cell phones without passcode protection have no less of a privacy interest than passcode-protected phones.SCC, par. 53, 160 However, the Court was split as to whether the common-law doctrine of search incident to arrest justified a search of the contents of a cell phone. = Majority = A majority of the Supreme Court, led by Cromwell J, affirmed the validity of the search incident to arrest framework as set out in R v Caslake and R v Golden. The majority found that the search of Fearon's cell phone was conducted subsequent to a lawful arrest and was truly incidental to the arrest, as it was conducted to locate the handgun, thus ensuring public safety; to locating the stolen jewelry, thus avoiding the loss of evidence; and to obtain evidence about the crime and any accomplices to the robbery.SCC, par. 33 Next, the majority determined that the common-law doctrine of search incident to arrest‚Äîa power granting police the opportunity to conduct a search without a warrant or without reasonable and probable groundsSCC, par. 45‚Äîshould be modified to comply with section 8 of the Charter. The majority rejected an outright categorical prohibition on warrantless cell phone searches incident to arrest, finding that this would conflict with valid law enforcement objectives, including police and general public safety, and noting that a cell phone search is not necessarily a significant privacy invasion.SCC, par. 61 The majority equally rejected a moderate approach that would require reasonable and probable grounds for a cell phone search incident to arrest, again finding that this would hamper and undermine law enforcement objectives. The majority also dismissed an approach that would allow cell phone searches incident to arrest only in exigent circumstances, finding that this would \\"effectively gut\\"SCC, par. 70 police powers and would conflict with established Supreme Court jurisprudence on this issue. Instead, the majority proposed three modifications to the existing common-law framework. First, the nature and extent of the search must be truly incidental to arrest, thus allowing access only to information with a \\"necessary link\\"SCC, par. 76 to the purpose of the search. Second, cell phone searches incident to arrest undertaken to discover evidence will be valid only if the investigation would be \\"stymied or significantly hampered\\"SCC, par. 100-106 were it not for the search. Third, officers conducting cell phone searches incident to arrest must take comprehensive notes of the examination, detailing the purpose, extent and duration of the search as well as any applications accessed. The majority held that the evidence should not be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter, on the basis of the Grant factors. Although the search of Fearon's phone impinged on his privacy, the breach was not particularly serious, and the police legitimately believed that they were acting reasonably and in good faith. The majority agreed with the trial judge's assessment that excluding the evidence would undermine the judiciary's truth-seeking function. = Dissent = The dissenting judges, led by Karakatsanis J, would have allowed the appeal. They found the search unconstitutional, holding that warrantless search of a cell phone incident to arrest is prima facie unreasonable, as it is not authorized by law. The dissenting judges found a high expectation of privacy in cell phones, recognizing the immense data storage and retention capabilities of modern cell phones, the volume of metadata generated by cell phones, and the possibility that a search of a cell phone might access data stored in the cloud, not on the cell phone itself.

Exigent circumstances would require of law enforcement a \\"reasonable basis to suspect a search may prevent an imminent threat to safety or... reasonable grounds to believe that the imminent loss or destruction of evidence may be prevented by a warrantless search\\".SCC, par. 137 Under the dissenting judges' modification, the objective of protecting officer safety would justify a warrantless search only if the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the phone had been used to generate a threat to his safety. Likewise, the preservation of evidence objective would justify a warrantless search only in those cases where it was reasonable to believe that evidence was being destroyed and that a cell phone search could prevent this destruction. In any other, non-exigent circumstances, the dissenting judges held that a warrant would be required for the search. The dissenting judges would also have excluded the evidence under section 24(2) of the Charter, on the basis of the seriousness of the breach of Fearon's substantial privacy interest in the contents of his cell phone.  Impact  Reaction to the Supreme Court's decision was mixed. Although the decision was seen as affirming and entrenching digital privacy rights, the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic suggested that the decision \\"transforms the traditional incident to arrest search into a far broader fishing expedition\\".

All of the GPUs of the series are produced in 28 nm format and use the Graphics Core Next (GCN) micro-architecture. The GPUs are based on the Fiji architecture. Some of the cards of the series include the flagship AMD Radeon R9 Fury X along with the Radeon R9 Fury and Radeon R9 Nano, which are the first GPUs to feature High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology, which AMD developed with SK Hynix; HBM is faster and more power efficient than GDDR5 memory. However, the remaining GPUs in the series are based on previous generation GPUs with revised power management and therefore only feature GDDR5 memory. The Radeon 300 series cards including the R9 390X were released on June 18, 2015. The flagship device, the Fury X, was released on June 24, 2015, with the dual-GPU variant, the Radeon Pro Duo, being released on April 26, 2016.  Micro-architecture and instruction set  The R9 380 along with the R9 Fury & Nano series were AMD's first cards to use the third iteration of their GCN instruction set and micro-architecture. The other cards in the series feature first and second gen iterations of GCN. The table below details which GCN-generation each chip belongs to. HBM.  Ancillary ASICs  Any ancillary ASICs present on the chips are being developed independently of the core architecture and have their own version name schemes. =Multi-monitor support= The AMD Eyefinity branded on-die display controllers were introduced in September 2009 in the Radeon HD 5000 Series and have been present in all products since. = AMD TrueAudio = AMD TrueAudio was introduced with the AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series, but can only be found on the dies of GCN 1.1 and later products. = Video acceleration = AMD's SIP core for video acceleration, Unified Video Decoder and Video Coding Engine, are found on all GPUs and are supported by AMD Catalyst and by the open-source Radeon graphics driver. =Frame limiter= A completely new feature to the lineup allows users to reduce power consumption by not rendering unnecessary frames. It will be user configurable. =LiquidVR support= LiquidVR is a technology that improves the smoothness of virtual reality. The aim is to reduce latency between hardware so that the hardware can keep up with the user's head movement, eliminating the motion sickness. A particular focus is on dual GPU setups where each GPU will now render for one eye individually of the display. =Virtual super resolution support= Originally introduced with the previous generation R9 285 and R9 290 series graphics cards, this feature allows users to run games with higher image quality by rendering frames at above native resolution. Each frame is then downsampled to native resolution. This process is an alternative to supersampling which is not supported by all games. Virtual super resolution is similar to Dynamic Super Resolution, a feature available on competing nVidia graphics cards, but trades flexibility for increased performance. = OpenCL (API) = OpenCL accelerates many scientific Software Packages against CPU up to factor 10 or 100 and more.

As of July 2014, other operating systems are not officially supported. This may be different for the AMD FirePro brand, which is based on identical hardware but features OpenGL-certified graphics device drivers. AMD Catalyst supports all features advertised for the Radeon brand. = Free and open-source graphics device driver \`radeon\` = The free and open-source drivers are primarily developed on and for Linux, but have been ported to other operating systems as well. Each driver is composed out of five parts: # Linux kernel component DRM # Linux kernel component KMS driver: basically the device driver for the display controller # user-space component libDRM # user-space component in Mesa 3D # a special and distinct 2D graphics device driver for X.Org Server, which is finally about to be replaced by Glamor The free and open-source \`radeon\` kernel driver supports most of the features implemented into the Radeon line of GPUs. The \`radeon\` kernel driver is not reverse engineered, but based on documentation released by AMD. This drivers still requires proprietary microcode to operate DRM functions and some GPUs may fail to launch the X server if not available. = Free and open-source graphics device driver \`amdgpu\` = This new kernel driver is directly supported and developed by AMD. It is available on various Linux distributions, and has been ported to some other operating systems as well. Only GCN GPUs are supported. = Proprietary graphics device driver AMDGPU-PRO = This new driver by AMD is still undergoing development, but can be used on a few supported Linux distributions already (AMD officially supports Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS). The driver has been experimentally ported to ArchLinux and other distributions.

A. (1981): Memorial of Wilhelm Hermann Julius Eitel May 6, 1891 - July 20, 1979. American Mineralogist, vol.66, pp.647-648. Dr. Eitel is the author of a multitude of scientific papers and books; he had just completed volume 8 of his monograph series \\"Physical Chemistry of Silicates\\", when he died. Wilhelm Eitel received an honorary law degree from the University of Toledo; he had been guest professor at the University of Bologna (Italy) and the Technische Universit√§t Aachen. Professor Wilhelm Eitel was a member of many professional societies, among which the British Society of Glass Technology, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Ceramic Society and the Division of Engineering and Industrial Research of the National Research Council. A wide variety of scientific problems were being studied at the KWI, including the manufacture of \\"Panzerglass\\" (bullet-proof glass) from local German raw materials and the hydrothermal synthesis of the mineral muscovite. Notably the latter research was of such great value to the Office of Strategic Services, that attention was focused on the person of Wilhelm Eitel (see: Lasby, 1971; Macrakis, 1993). One of the first tasks for Eitel in the USA was found in the \\"Synthetic Mica Program\\" at the Electronical Laboratory of the United States Bureau of Mines in Norris, Tennessee. Synthetic mica was of strategic interest to the United States, because it would have to provide an alternative for natural muscovite for use in electronic equipment. Nazi Involvement Eitel had become a member of Hitler's NSDAP in May 1933, and remained a staunch supporter of the Nazi Party until his unsolicited transfer to the USA in 1945.Macrakis, K.

Biography Jan Verveer was born in Rotterdam to Johannes Verveer and Anna Maria van Alphen. Verveer joined the army in 1797. In 1803, he was sent to the Dutch West Indies where he remained until 1815. From 1807, Verveer served as Commander of Sint Maarten, until the island was taken by British forces in 1810. He then returned to the Netherlands where he served in the military administration. In 1826, Verveer was an observer to the Congress of Panama. As a consequence of this mission, he became the principal adviser of King William I of the Netherlands on the Nicaragua Canal. In the autumn of 1836, Verveer was appointed a Royal Commissioner by King William I of the Netherlands and charged with concluding a treaty with the King of Ashanti Kwaku Dua I Panyin to facilitate the recruitment of soldiers to the Royal Netherlands Indies Army. Verveer arrived in Elmina, the capital of the Dutch Gold Coast, on 1 November 1836, and departed for the Ashanti capital of Kumasi with a retinue of about 900 people, the majority of whom were porters carrying provisions and gifts. After lengthy negotiations, an agreement was reached in Kumasi, resulting in the establishment of a recruiting office in Kumasi headed by Jacob Huydecoper. After having concluded the treaty, Verveer returned to the Netherlands together with Kwasi Boakye and Kwame Poku, two young Ashanti princes who were to receive education in the Netherlands. A year later, however, Verveer was sent back to the Gold Coast to quell the rebellion of Ahanta. Verveer became ill during this campaign and died on the ship that was to take him home to the Netherlands. In the arts Jan Verveer is portrayed in the 1997 novel The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi by Arthur Japin.
