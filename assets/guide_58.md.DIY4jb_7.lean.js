She was also one of the four \\"Blitz kids\\" featured in David Mallet's music video for David Bowie's 1980 number 1 hit Ashes to Ashes. After graduating from Saint Martin's School of Art, Gilroy set up her own design label, Darla Jane Gilroy, which had a shop on London's King's Road. Gilroy travelled extensively, manufacturing under license in Hong Kong and living in the Far East for four years. This work has been considered exemplary of what Black British designers brought to mainstream British fashion in the 80s and 90s, and consequently some of her work from this period has been featured in London's Victoria & Albert Museum. Her design work received considerable publicity when it was available, helping to define the glamorous, flamboyant style with which British fashion of the 80s and 90s is still associated. Gilroy has had a long involvement with design education, both undergraduate and post graduate, as a visiting lecturer, external examiner and course advisor, teaching at Ravensbourne, Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, the University of Westminster, Southampton University, University of East London, and most recently the University of the Arts. She is currently the Programme Director for the Design and Craft group of courses at London College of Fashion. She has taught postgraduate students at The Royal College of Art in the School of Fashion and Textiles and has her own practice as a consultant designer and trend predictor. In 1995 she became the Course Leader of the BA Hons in Footwear and Accessories Design and Product Development at Cordwainers College and in 1999 she became Head of Department and Subject Leader in Fashion at Winchester School of Art. She has maintained her professional practice mostly through her design and trends consultancy, The Future Perfect, working to predict cultural trends for clients such as McCann Erickson advertising agency and Unilever.

These are sculptured with closely set longitudinal costae, crossed near the upper end by a slight spiral groove, thus forming an infra- sutural crenate band. The interstices between the costae are spirally punctate. The punctations of the upper row are coarser than the rest. The small aperture is narrow. The columella descends rather obliquely. The peristome is simple. The base of the shell is marked with three revolving punctate grooves.Preston, H.

They are colloquially called tooth fungi. Originally such fungi were referred to the genus Hydnum (\\"hydnoid\\" means Hydnum-like), but it is now known that not all hydnoid species are closely related. History Hydnum was one of the original genera created by Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum of 1753. It contained all species of fungi with fruit bodies bearing pendant, tooth-like projections. Subsequent authors described around 900 species in the genus. With increasing use of the microscope, it became clear that not all tooth fungi were closely related and most Hydnum species were gradually moved to other genera. The Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus paid particular attention to the group, producing a series of papers reviewing the taxonomy of hydnoid fungi.Maas Geesteranus RA. (1960‚Äì1974).

The original genus Hydnum is still current, but is now restricted to the type species, Hydnum repandum, and its relatives in the order Cantharellales. Other species originally described in Hydnum have been reassigned to various genera in various orders including the Agaricales, Auriculariales, Gomphales, Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, Russulales, Thelephorales and Trechisporales.Hibbett D et al.

Mycological Research 111: 1040‚Äì1063. Description and genera The fruit bodies of hydnoid fungi are diverse, but all produce their spores on the surface of pendant, tooth-like or spine-like projections. Stipitate hydnoid fungi Some terrestrial species producing fruit bodies with a pileus (cap) and stipe (stem) are collectively known as the stipitate hydnoid fungi and are often studied as a group because of their ecological similarity. The species concerned are now referred to the genera Bankera, Hydnellum, Phellodon, and Sarcodon. All are ectomycorrhizal, belong in the Thelephorales, and are considered to be indicator species of old, species-rich forests. In Europe, at least, many are of conservation concern and feature on national or regional red lists of threatened fungal species. In the United Kingdom the stipitate hydnoid fungi have been given Biodiversity Action Plan statusUK Biodiversity Action Plans which has increased interest in the group and has generated funding to be put into survey workNewton AC et al. (2002). Status and distribution of stipitate hydnoid fungi in Scottish coniferous forests.

A PCR-based method for detecting the mycelia of stipitate hydnoid fungi in soil. J. Microbiol. Methods 75: 40‚Äì46. Species of Hydnum and the related Sistotrema confluens (Cantharellales) are also mycorrhizal, but have different ecological requirements. Other stipitate hydnoid fungi are wood decomposing, such as some species of Beenakia (Gomphales), Climacodon (Polyporales) and Mycorrhaphium (Polyporales). Resupinate hydnoid fungi The largest group of fungi formerly placed in the genus Hydnum are wood-rotting species, forming patch- like fruit bodies on dead attached branches, logs, stumps, and fallen wood. Species with small \\"teeth\\" (just a millimetre or so long) are sometimes described as \\"odontioid\\" (tooth-like). Species that form resupinate (effused) fruiting bodies are also considered part of the corticioid fungi. Genera that have hydnoid or odontioid representatives include Hydnochaete, Hyphodontia and Odonticium (Hymenochaetales), Dentipellis (Russulales), Dentocorticium, Mycoacia, Radulodon, Steccherinum (Polyporales) and Sarcodontia. Additional hydnoid fungi Other hydnoid fungi include a group of conspicuous, wood- rotting species with long spines belonging to the genus Hericium (Russulales), often referred to as \\"tooth fungi\\".Pegler DN et al. (1997). British chanterelles and tooth fungi. Kew: Royal Botanic Gardens. . The ear-pick fungus and other species of Auriscalpium (Russulales) are hydnoid, as is the odd jelly fungus Pseudohydnum gelatinosum (Auriculariales). The distinction between polypores and hydnoid fungi is not always clear‚Äîirregular, split pores can also be interpreted as teeth. Consequently, some species are considered hydnoid or poroid depending on the context (e.g. Irpex lacteus).

Beginning with British philology in the colonial period, Hindu studies has been practiced largely by Westerners, due in part to the lack of a distinct department for religion in Indian academia. Since the 1990s this has caused some dissent from Hindus, raising questions in academia about the role of Hindu studies in creating postcolonial images of India. Philological era Between the period 1789 and 1832, British perceptions of Indian culture were completely reversed. Before that time, the British viewed Indians as disorganized and lacking a coherent philosophy. After the mid-19th century, however, the term \\"Hinduism\\" became acceptable in English use to refer to an overarching religious structure that spanned India. This was not a one-sided fabrication, since self-identified Hindus met the British challenge with a reappropriation of \\"Hinduism\\" and defense of their own culture.Brian Kemble Pennington, Was Hinduism Invented?. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 3-4 The early study of Hinduism chiefly constituted translations of and commentaries on Sanskrit texts, rather than observation of present-day Hindu life. This historical emphasis on philology has had a strong influence on present day Hindu studies, which often emphasizes medieval and classical period Hinduism. Later researchers By the time Wendy Doniger became involved with Hindu studies, the nature of Hinduism as a single category was already in question, having been discussed in Wilfred Cantwell Smith's The Meaning and End of Religion (1962). In a general-audience response, she claimed in the Wilson Quarterly (1991) that Hinduism could be imagined as a \\"Venn diagram\\" which together constituted a whole, or akin to light being both a wave and a particle.Wendy Doniger. \\"Hinduism by Any Other Name\\". Wilson Quarterly 15.3 (1991). Doctoral programs in Hinduism studies Since the mid nineteen nineties, some universities have started to offer doctoral programs in Hindu Theology. One of the universities is Hindu University of America, accredited by the National Public Schools Alliance which is not recognized as an accrediting agency by the U.S. Department of Education. Criticism Beginning in the 1990s, North American Hindu groups began protesting the academic portrayal of their culture.Arti Dhand. \\"Hinduism to Hindus in the Western Diaspora.\\" Method & Theory in the Study of Religion 17.3 (2005). This began in 1995 with the publication of Kali's Child, Jeffrey Kripal's psychoanalytic biography of Ramakrishna. In 1995, the book won the American Academy of Religion award. The book became controversial and Kripal himself became deeply involved in discussing the book with Hindu critics and western scholars. Another controversial psychoanalytical is by Paul B. Courtright's Ganesa: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings. Courtright responded that he did not see anything coming out of the Hindu criticism that was worth responding to;Paul B. Courtright. \\"The Self-Serving Humility of Disciplining Liberal Humanist Scholars\\". Journal of the American Academy of Religion 74.3 (2006), 752-755 Wendy Doniger, for her part, quickly stopped responding to Hindu complaints, and after being egged at a lecture in Britain canceled a talk in Bengal.Amy M. Braverman. \\"The interpretation of gods\\". University of Chicago Magazine, 97.2 (December 2004). At the same Britain conference, Wendy Doniger was questioned about her qualifications to speak on Hinduism. According to witnesses, she avoided giving an answer when asked whether she had herself been psychoanalyzed. In 2002, Rajiv Malhotra founder of Infinity foundation rekindled the debate with a blog post called \\"RISA Lila - 1: Wendy's Child Syndrome\\". In the article, Malhotra questioned the application of Freudian psychoanalytical approach in the study of Hinduism and argued that this has been discredited among Western Psychologists and the scholars were not trained psychoanalysts and the approach was not applicable to non-Western subjects. Published on Sulekha.com, the article was widely read.Martha C. Nussbaum, The Clash Within: Democracy, Religious Violence, and India's Future (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009), p. 248 In 2007 Invading the Sacred, a book written by a multitude of professors including Antonio De Nicholas of Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York, psychoanalyst Alan Roland, S.N. Balagangadhara, Pandita Indrani Rampersad and others which aimed to counter-analyze and refute the dominant narrative of Hindu studies. Anantanand Rambachan wrote that \\"there can be little doubt about the importance and legitimacy of many of the concerns raised by the authors of Invading the Sacred about the academic study of Hinduism in the United States.\\" Insider/outsider problem The Hindu criticism of Western Hindu studies relies on the terms etic and emic to explain what is missing from Western interpretations. The authors of Invading the Sacred by and large claim that the outsider, etic, perspective has historically shielded scholars from feeling affected by their judgments. However, Shrinivas Tilak writes that insider, emic, scholars must take care to avoid bias as well.Shrinivas Tilak. \\"Taking Back Hindu Studies\\" . In John Stratton Hawley and Vasudha Narayanan, eds., The Life of Hinduism. University of California Press, 2006. Russell T. McCutcheon, the author of Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion, has used the controversy as a means to present his own perspective on the insider/outsider problem. In his article \\"It's a Lie. There's No Truth in It! It's a Sin!\\", McCutcheon focuses on the attitude of the scholars, who he thinks are going too far in trying to unify the concerns of the Hindus with their own interests. McCutcheon himself believes that rejecting the worldviews of the insiders is essential if religious scholars aim to be something other than \\"dedicated disciples to one set of voices.\\"Russell T. McCutcheon. \\"It's a Lie. There's No Truth in It! It's a Sin!\\": On the Limits of the Humanistic Study of Religion and the Costs of Saving Others from Themselves. Journal of the American Academy of Religion 74.3 (2006), 747 He believes that Hindu scholars should make it clear that they are presenting a view that is critical of Hinduism, because presenting a non-critical view means \\"the end of the human sciences as we know them.\\"McCutcheon 2006, 736 Addressing specific Hindu scholars, McCutcheon sides with Courtright et al. by holding the view that \\"as scholars we have an intellectual and institution imperative to, at times, study people precisely in ways unwelcome by them.\\"McCutcheon 2006, 729-730 However, the authors of Invading the Sacred assert that they critique etic Western evaluations of Hinduism \\"not because it is offensive or politically incorrect, but because it is baseless and untruthful.\\" McCutcheon places himself in opposition to Wilfred Cantwell Smith, one of the leading figures of 20th century religious studies, who wrote that religious traditions must always be taught in a way acceptable to insiders.WC Smith. \\"Comparative religion: whither--and why?\\" In Eliade and Kitagawa, The History of Religions. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1959. S.N. Balagangadhara also points out that \\"some of these 'dialogues' exacerbate violence; they do not reduce it\\". Defining Hinduism Malhotra's conclusion, however, was that Wendy Doniger was using her authority as a scholar to overrule the culture's self-identity: \\"Rights of individual scholars must be balanced against rights of cultures and communities they portray, especially minorities that often face intimidation. Scholars should criticize but not define another's religion.\\" Doniger denies that she is defining Hinduism.

SIBUR operates production sites located all over Russia, has over 1,400 major customers engaged in the energy, automotive, construction, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), chemical and other industries in approximately 70 countries worldwide and employs around 26,000 personnel. In 2018, its revenue was USD 9.1 bln and EBITDA USD 3.2 bln.  History  SIBUR was founded by government decree in 1995. 38% of its shares were state owned and the remaining 62% of the company was made public. Towards the end of 1998, SIBUR started its transformation into a vertically integrated petrochemical holding with a full production chain from the processing of raw materials through to the manufacture of finished goods. Michael Cherney, its controlling shareholder at the time, invested over $110 million in SIBUR‚Äôs business development and expansion programme. SIBUR subsequently built up assets by buying stakes in petrochemical companies all over Russia, including some 60 companies. By 2001, Gazprom had acquired control of SIBUR with a 51% stake. In 2003, Alexander Dyukov was appointed president and oversaw a reform with a long-term growth strategy and implementation of infrastructure updates. By September, the stock was divided between Gazprom (25%) and Gazprombank (75%). Dyukov was succeeded by Dmitry Konov as SIBUR‚Äôs new president towards the end of 2006. In July 2005, SIBUR founded AKS Holding (whose legal successor is today's SIBUR) to clean up the holding's debts of RUB 60 bn, with most of this amount due to the parent company. The balance sheet of AKS Holding received the shares of 26 petrochemical businesses held by SIBUR. In December 2005, AKS Holding was renamed SIBUR Holding. In 2008, Gazprom decided that the petrochemical business was a non-core asset, and SIBUR shares were sold to Gazfond in exchange for its energy assets. Both Gazprombank and Gazfond also withdrew from the Gazprom group. In December 2010, Gazprombank began a phased sale of SIBUR to Leonid Mikhelson. In 2011, SIBUR began exiting its non-core production assets, including its tyre and mineral fertilizer businesses, which it sold. Instead, the company focused on investing in polymer investments. By 2020, SIBUR is planning to launch ZapSibNeftekhim on the basis of the Tobolsk Production Site which is to become Russia‚Äôs largest petrochemical complex, permitting SIBUR to double polymer production.  Corporate affairs = Ownership  By the autumn of 2011, 100% of SIBUR were owned by the company SIBUR Limited, which since 2013 is 82.5% owned by Leonid Mikhelson and Gennady Timchenko. The owners of the remaining 17.5% include SIBUR's former and current top management. In 2014 Timchenko's share was purchased by Kirill Shamalov, deputy chairman of SIBUR, increasing his share to 21.3%. As of 28 April 2017, ownership of SIBUR was divided as follows: Leonid Mikhelson ‚Äì 48.5%, Gennady Timchenko ‚Äì 17%, current and former managers of SIBUR Holding 14.5%, Sinopec 10%, Silk Road Fund 10%. In December 2015, Sinopec completed a 10% minority strategic investment in SIBUR. In January 2017, Silk Road Fund closed the deal on its acquisition of 10% equity stake in SIBUR.  Operations =Midstream The Group‚Äôs midstream segment comprises: * processing of associated petroleum gas (APG) that SIBUR purchases from major Russian oil companies, * transportation, fractionation and other processing of natural gas liquids (NGLs) that SIBUR produces internally or purchases from major Russian oil and gas companies, and * marketing and sales of feedstock products, such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), naphtha, raw NGL, methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and other fuels and fuel additives. SIBUR‚Äôs feedstock processing infrastructure includes seven out of the nine existing GPPs in Western Siberia, five compressor stations and three GFUs. = Midstream facilities = * OAO SiburTyumenGaz (100%) * OOO Zapsibtransgaz (100%) * OOO Yuzhno-Priobskiy GPP (50%) (JV with Gazprom Neft Group)  Petrochemicals  Workers of the Tobolsk-Polimer chemical plant In its petrochemicals business, the Group has been operating three steam cracker facilities, one PDH unit, two basic polymers production plants, manufacturing low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP), three synthetic rubbers production plants, manufacturing commodity and specialty rubbers as well as thermoplastic elastomers, and 13 production plants manufacturing plastics and organic synthesis products, including polyethylene terephthalate, glycols, alcohols, BOPP-films, expandable polystyrene, acrylates as well as a wide range of intermediate chemicals. SIBUR has used, amongst others, Navigator Holdings, a shipping firm owned by Wilbur Ross, U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Donald Trump to ship LPG since 2012.Reuters Staff Russia's Sibur says had no direct dealings with Wilbur Ross November 6, 2017 In 2017 SIBUR released a statement denying that they had ever directly dealt with Ross, stating that all negotiations and meetings were held by SIBUR and Navigator management, and without any shareholders involvement.

Mineral fertiliser business At the end of December 2011, SIBUR sold its mineral fertiliser assets to URALCHEM (Mineral Fertilisers, Perm) and Siberian Business Union (Kemerovo Azot and Angarsk Azotno-Tukovy Zavod). Acquisitions * In 2009, SIBUR acquired 50% stake in Russian BOPP-films producer BIAXPLEN. In March 2012, SIBUR gained control of the BIAXPLEN group of companies by increasing its stake from 50% to 100%. At the time of the acquisition, production facilities of the BIAXPLEN group comprised three plants located in the Nizhny Novgorod, Kursk and Moscow regions with a total capacity of 78,000 metric tons of commodity films per annum. * In 2011, SIBUR acquired JSC Acrylate - the only CIS-based producer of acrylic acid and its estersfrom ATEK Group. Joint ventures * In June 2007, SIBUR established OOO RusVinyl, a 50/50 joint venture with SolVin Holding Nederland B.V.. This joint venture was established to construct a PVC plant with a capacity of 330 ktpa for PVC and 225 ktpa for caustic soda. * In February 2012, SIBUR entered into a joint venture arrangement with Reliance Industries Limited, pursuant to which a JV Reliance Sibur Elastomers Private Limited was set up, in which SIBUR owns a 25.1% stake. This joint venture was established for the development of butyl rubber production facility in India with capacity of 120 ktpa. It would start production by 2015. * In October 2012, SIBUR signed an agreement with Solvay S.A.-(after initial negotiations with Rhodia (company) which was acquired by Solvay) to establish RusPav, a 50/50% joint venture. It was established to develop a surfactant and oilfield process chemicals production site in Dzerzhinsk, the Nizhny Novgorod region. * In August 2013, SIBUR and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec Corp.) entered into a joint venture developed on the site of the Krasnoyarsk Synthetic Rubber Plant (KZSK), where Sinopec purchased 25% + 1 share of KZSK.

Career and research After a brief postdoctoral fellowship in Whittaker's lab, S√ºdhof moved to the United States in 1983, where he began postdoctoral training in the department of molecular genetics at the University of Texas Health Science Center (now the UT Southwestern Medical Center) in Dallas, Texas, under the supervision of Michael Stuart Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein. During his postdoctoral research fellowship, S√ºdhof worked to describe the role of the LDL receptor in cholesterol metabolism, for which Brown and Goldstein were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985. S√ºdhof finished his postdoctoral training in 1986 and was elected to be an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He then established his own laboratory at UT Southwestern Medical Center where he focused on the molecular and cellular neurosciences centered on synapses for over 20 years. In 2008, S√ºdhof moved to Stanford University and is currently the Avram Goldstein Professor in the School of Medicine as well as a Professor of Molecular & Cellular Physiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Thomas C. S√ºdhof laid the foundations for his scientific career studying the synapse early while studying the mechanisms of neurotransmitter dependent hormone release from neuroendocrine cells for his doctoral thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. S√ºdhof described the structure and function of chromaffin cells which are responsible for the release of epinephrine, norepinephrine and endorphins from the medulla of the adrenal gland. Innervated by sympathetic nervous system, chromaffin cells are important in the initiation of the fight-or-flight response of animals when exposed to threatening stimuli. After completing his thesis in 1983, S√ºdhof moved to UT Southwestern Medical Center for his postdoctoral training where he began researching in the department of molecular genetics under the supervision of Joseph L. Goldstein and Michael Stuart Brown. While a postdoctoral fellow, S√ºdhof cloned the gene for the low-density lipoprotein receptor and, soon after, was able to explain its transcriptional regulation by cholesterol. When LDL receptors, found concentrated in the liver, bind specific free blood cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, they are internalized and recycled removing the cholesterol from circulation. This process is a primary source of blood cholesterol regulation and variations in its efficiency were shown to be present in familial hypercholesterolemia. As a result of the discovery, LDL receptor function had also elucidated the principle of receptor-mediated endocytosis‚Äîa now universally understood process in cell biology. Goldstein and Brown were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery in 1985. After finishing postdoctoral training, Thomas S√ºdhof started his own laboratory at UT Southwestern in 1986. Briefly continuing work with Goldstein and Brown, S√ºdhof helped identify a DNA element in the LDL gene that produced sterol mediated end-product repression when inserted in a viral promoter. This domain, known as a sterol regulatory sequence, directly participates in the regulation of sterol biosynthesis. Sterols are a major class of biomolecule and critical for life. Important sterols in humans include cholesterol and steroid hormones. Discovery of sterol regulatory elements and LDL receptor function led to the subsequent development of statin derived cholesterol medications such as atorvastatin (Lipitor)‚Äîthe top-selling branded pharmaceutical drug in the world in 2008. S√ºdhof started his independent research career in neuroscience since 1986 and open the field of molecular neuroscience for synaptic transmission especially from the presynaptic nerve terminal perspective. Until S√ºdhof began his work, majority of neuroscience research was aimed at the postsynaptic neuron and its role in learning and memory. Indeed, Thomas S√ºdhof is credited with discovering much of the machinery mediating neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity in his 21 years at UT Southwestern. S√ºdhof began with the discovery of synaptotagmins and their role in neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron. Synaptotagmin, a transmembrane protein found in neurosecretory vesicles, functions as a calcium sensor triggering vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. Stimulation of a neuron results in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. After binding calcium ion to a region in its cytosolic domain, vesicular synaptotagmin promotes quick or slow neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron via interaction with regulatory and fusion related proteins such as members of the SNARE complex. S√ºdhof also discovered RIMs and Muncs (most notably Munc13 and Munc18), soluble proteins which aid in the fusion of neurotransmitter vesicles to the nerve cell membrane and play an important role in synaptic plasticity. In addition, S√ºdhof's research uncovered the role of many other proteins facilitating vesicle binding, fusion, and resultant neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron, including members of the SNARE complex: synaptobrevin, in the vesicular membrane, syntaxin, in the cell membrane, and SNAP25, which is tethered to the cytosolic side of the cell membrane via cysteine-linked palmitoyl chains and holds the complex of four helices together. S√ºdhof was also responsible for elucidating the action of tetanus and botulinum toxins, which selectively cleave synaptobrevin and SNAP25, respectively, inhibiting vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane. A second influential contribution of Thomas S√ºdhof is on synapse formation and specifications. S√ºdhof discovered a number of key molecules in this process such as neurexins, present on presynaptic neurons, and neuroligins, present on postsynaptic neurons, that come together to form a physical protein bridge across the synapse. The diversity in types of neurexins and neuroligins allows for a variety of unique binding opportunities between neurons and impart a specificity to synaptic connections. Additionally he also discovered or elucidated the important functions of SynCAM, Latrophilins etc. in synapse formation. In additional studies, S√ºdhof identified mutations in these proteins as a factor in inherited autism. S√ºdhof is striving to elucidate the mechanism by which neurexins and neuroligins locate each other to form the synapse, their transcriptional regulation, and control of their variability. Thomas S√ºdhof currently continues his work on synapse formation, maintenance as well as synaptic releases in his laboratory at Stanford University. Additionally, together with Dr. Marius Wernig at Stanford University, S√ºdhof developed induced neuronal cell technology where they can use human neuronal cells derived from patients or genetically engineered with defined mutations that linked to neuropsychiatric disorders or neurodevelopmental disorders. S√ºdhof's research has not only given the scientific community a great understanding of the processes underlying synaptic transmission and synapse formation, but has also advanced medical knowledge of mechanisms behind poorly understood diseases such as Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, and Autism. He is currently working with a diverse group of researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to develop mouse models for mutants of synaptic genes. The project aims to drastically advance our understanding of neurological disorders. He also serves on the Research Consortium of Cure Alzheimer's Fund.  Science and policy  S√ºdhof recently also engages in scientific ethics as exemplified by his recent work at PLOS Biology Truth in Science Publishing: A personal Perspective and various interviews including his discussion about music, policy and medicine with The Lancet. In 2017, he published an article in the Washington Post on basic research vs. drug development.

Mattel intends to sell the product in Europe starting in July 2010, but not in North America, because the company owns the rights to Scrabble and its derivatives worldwide except for in North America, where rival company Hasbro holds control of the game. Rule differences Trickster has rules that are similar to those of Scrabble, with some notable differences. The new game occasionally allows words such as proper nouns to be used, as well as words that are spelled backwards. Players can also be allowed to \\"steal\\" letter tiles from other players. Players can only execute these moves when they place a word on specially marked squares that ask that the player draws a randomly chosen card, which contains instructions that may include one of the previously mentioned actions. Reception The initial announcement of the new game brought forward some controversy when widespread media announcementsScrabble Amends The RulesNew Scrabble to Allow Proper NamesBBC: Proper nouns come into play in Scrabble rule changeScrabble allows proper nouns; a nation mourns its lost innocence implied that the rules to Scrabble would be changing, before learning that the new rules would in fact apply to a newly developed game.No Proper Nouns In ScrabbleProper Nouns Will Not Be Allowed in Scrabble Criticism of the newly introduced variant typically refers to the game as a \\"dumbed down\\" version of Scrabble, made to appeal to more casual players who are more familiar with the names of celebrities than lesser known words from the Scrabble dictionary.

Varying by sport, demographics, and location, sporting rituals often become essential to the preparation, organization, and game-day experience. In fact, many would argue that rituals are the experience. Ritualization in sports Rituals have become an integral part of sporting events in the United States. Traditionally, before games, students and fans engage in a variety of pregame celebrations including pep rallies, tailgating, and informal gatherings. This ritual of carousing continues throughout the game into the postgame celebrations. The ritualization of sporting events involves numerous individuals including the fans, players, and crews in charge of maintaining and preparing the fields and stadiums. The importance of ritual in sporting events cannot be understated. Fields and stadiums must be properly maintained and prepared before game day. Fans not only spend hours preparing for game day, often the entire day is dedicated to game day celebrations. Fans even have many pregame rituals that include superstitious activities, such as dressing in certain clothes, making specific foods, and even sitting in particular seats in hopes of their team winning. For many of the players, rituals have become superstitious; however, it is believed that the players don't rely on superstitions to win, but are used in hopes of continuing their winning streaks or good luck. After all the preparation and game-play, the ritual continues in the form of festivities and celebrations. Understanding rituals in sport The origins of rituals and how and why an individual partakes in traditions vary from person to person. Studies through the use of interviews have identified that individuals may seek to join in traditions as a means to fit in culturally. Traditions are often a means of identity, and joining in specific traditions or trends is a way to form a cultural identity that is similar to your surrounding environment. Often individuals join in a particular activity or ritual, such as dressing in team colors or going to rallies, as a result of the influences around them; being family, friends, and the surrounding social environment. Culturally important activities gain the support of the surrounding community and fans. The compiled support for rituals results in an enterprise. These rituals become both tradition and business, as many universities and communities make profit off of ritual events (i.e. the trend of going to games and purchasing tickets and team gear). Over time, starting in the 1900s, as varsity team popularity grew, so did the popularity of commercialization, therefore, starting fan support and traditions. Various sport rituals Every sport maintains different rituals. Occurrences of rituals in every sport will typically be carried out over pre-game, game-play, and post-game rituals. While there are specific rituals associated with many teams, the organization of game play often determines the type of rituals that take place. Rituals will often find comfortable homes in the time between game-play. Whether the game is divided into rounds, quarters, innings or another form of time keepings, the time between is filled with either a performance by cheer groups, the band, or other organizations, or participation from within the crowd in attendance through body movements, chants, or cheers. However, rituals are not isolated to the time between game-play, and silences, cheering, or intimidation and taunting can become part of the experience. Many sport participants and observers would be left with a feeling of absence if they didn't occur. Many passionate sport observers feel that the outcomes of particular games are of the most importance in their lives, and will conduct rituals in an attempt to increase the chance that their wishes come true. The rituals vary although their importance to those involved remains consistent. Members of Alpha Phi Omega carry the world's largest Texas flag during a pregame ceremony at a University of Texas football game. Another notable flag- related tradition is that of Washington State University; a group of alumni has arranged for a school flag to be flown at every broadcast of the football version of College GameDay since October 2003. Ritual in rivalry Ritual is often in the history and rivalry between schools. Ritual surrounds major sporting events between universities that have a profound sense of competition amongst each other. From the trophies and bragging rights awarded to winning teams, to the hype and tradition centering on the game itself, many university teams and communities take part in the rituals surrounding rivalry games. One such example that has been prominent since 1900 is the rivalry between the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma rivalry. Also known as the Red River Rivalry and Show Down, members of the teams and communities fight for both conference standing and national titles, but most importantly bragging rights. Played on a neutral field, the Longhorns and Sooners duke it out for the claim of the Red River for the year. One example of similar intensity is the Iron Bowl, the football rivalry between the University of Alabama and Auburn University. These teams play for a trophy, but more importantly ownership and bragging rights of the state. A further example of ritual within rivalry is the passing of the Old Oaken Bucket between the football teams of Indiana University and Purdue University. These two teams have been exchanging this 100-year-old bucket for the past 76 years. Crowned with a paired I-P from the first game resulting in a tie, each year, the winning team adds a \\"P\\" or an \\"I\\" link to the chain of the bucket, growing by victories. Finally, said to be \\"filled with the spirits of gridiron men,\\" the Little Brown Jug represents a steadfast football battle between the Universities of Michigan and Minnesota. This Little Brown Jug marked with a large \\"M\\" after a tie between the two teams in 1903 when the game was called two minutes because the storming of the field by fans has been the winning prize between the two rival teams. Painted, hidden, and returned to the winning team post victory, the jug has much history among the teams as the excitement and ritualistic passing of the jug is prominent. Ritual in school songs, cheers, and chants Colleges and universities around the country, both big and small, are often represented by a fight song or chant. This ritualistic activity is seen from coast to coast as students, athletes, and fans join in unison chanting and singing in support of their school. These songs, which often date to the early 20th century, are means to identify with a team and show support. Often played at the start of games, in response to game occurrences, and after wins, these songs and chants are ritual to bringing unison among supporters and engaging fans‚Äô teams. For example, the University of Southern California fight song \\"Fight On\\" was written in 1922 as a part of a spirit competition and now is sung at sporting events to cheer on USC teams. Texas A&M; University has a series of chants, yells, and songs, along with a traditional fight song the University members identify with. These are led by Yell Leaders rather than cheerleaders in order to \\"intensify the crowd\\" at games and events. Texas A&M;'s chants are even used to rally up students before game day at events such as Midnight Yell Practice, which began to take its roots in the early 1900s, as yell leaders direct the ritual chants and old army cheers. The Notre Dame Victory March is also a prominent example of tradition and ritual in unified support for a school through song and chant. Written in 1908, this song has stood the test of time as once trying to be rewritten by a different composer latter in the century. The refusal to promote and change songs shows dedication to the original, traditional fight song, which is played at Notre Dame events. Michigan State University's fight song was written in response to the rise in rivalry between university sports teams and served as a way to rally supports. The song was written by the yellmaster, Irving Lankey, as a way to further support for the football team and provide enthusiasm that stretched beyond the traditional band music available.https://www.msu.edu/~carillon/fitesong.htm One last example, The University of Oklahoma, has a fight song that dates back to 1905. The traditional song Boomer Sooner was written in order to raise crowd enthusiasm at football games and is still to this day sang as part of a team supporting and crowd involvement ritual. These songs and chants that are found at universities across the United States often have familiar tunes to them, because as the songs were written in the early 1900s, writers would often use songs previously used by other schools or already in existence as the basis for a fight song, such as the case with OU, using Yale's song but changing the words. Pep rallies and ceremonies as ritual Some of the very distinct aspects of pre-game rituals are the pep rallies that occur at schools across the country. Although pep rallies occur during lower levels of schooling, collegiate pep rallies tend to be much larger, especially before big games. One example of such a heated ceremony is the Texas A&M; Bonfire, which traditionally occurred prior to that school's annual matchup against the University of Texas in November. This event sparked a good deal of controversy within the A&M; community after 12 students were killed during a collapse in 1999. The event has since moved off campus and has remained unaffiliated with the University for the past 10 years. It is also important to note that the A&M; community glorifies the fallen Aggies with a memorial and most recently a DVD, which can be purchased on campus. A portion of the proceeds goes to the Bonfire Remembrance Fund. Auburn University has a tradition called the \\"Tiger Walk\\", which began in the 1960s. Prior to each home game, fans line Donahue Drive and cheer on the athletes as they walk from the athletes' dorm into the stadium for the game. The University of Texas students and fans also participated in a rally called the A&M; Hex Rally, which was put on by the Texas Exes organization, before the UT‚ÄìA&M; rivalry ended for the time being with A&M;'s 2012 move to the Southeastern Conference. This ritualistic gathering, chanting, and cheering of Longhorn fans began as an attempt to break a winning streak of Texas A&M; on the Aggies' home field. Group behaviors Many universities also have traditions that dictate group behavior before, during, and after the football games. For example, many schools create \\"dress codes\\" for specific games each season. Penn State and Texas A&M; host \\"white-outs\\" and \\"maroon-outs\\" during which the fans in the stands are expected to wear a specific color to create a sense of unity. Group behaviors aren't exclusive to the fans however. Players for the University of Notre Dame have a tradition of slapping a sign that reads \\"Play Like a Champion Today\\" as they leave the locker room and take the field. This tradition has been mimicked at other schools across the country. Although not originally associated with the United States, one of the most iconic group behaviors in world sports‚Äîthe haka of the New Zealand national rugby union team (the All Blacks)‚Äîhas been appropriated by a few American college and high school teams, generally those with a significant Polynesian influence. (The Polynesian connection stems from the origin of New Zealand's indigenous MƒÅori people, creators of the haka.) Most notably, the University of Hawaii football team performed the All Blacks' haka as part of its pregame ritual before adopting its own dance, the haa, based on Native Hawaiian traditions. It is not uncommon to see individuals showing hand gestures and signals at sporting events or within a university environment. For example, Texas Tech fans are known for their \\"Guns Up\\" hand gesture that resembles the shape of an L made by the thumb and forefinger. This began in 1972 and has traditionally represented the Tech Raiders shooting their opponents down and is often used in celebration at games. The popularity has grown among Baylor students of the saying \\"Sic 'Em Bears\\" with the hand gesture that resembles a bear claw. The cheer with the corresponding gesture is often seen as students cheer together for Baylor teams during competition. Preparations/dress In addition to the above-mentioned designated dress days, most fans tend to wear one of their team's primary colors to a game. This sort of dress, which is not unlike wearing \\"Sunday's Best\\" to Church, seems to assist in building commentary between fans and the team. Additionally, observations of the sidelines show that some coaches wear specific colors based on their duties on the field. In one photo of a Nebraska coach, we can see that he is wearing a less traditional color, probably so the players can identify him from the field easily when looking for the play call.

This military airport is owned by United States Army. Established as Post Field in 1917, it was one of thirty- two Air Service training camps established after the United States entry into World War I in April 1917.William R. Evinger: Directory of Military Bases in the U.S., Oryx Press, Phoenix, Ariz., 1991, p. 147. Overview Henry Post Army Airfield was the first home of all Army Aviation Training after World War II before moving to Fort Rucker, Alabama in 1954. It is a very historic airfield. There is still a balloon hangar, transported by rail cars from the Naval Air Station Moffett Field airship hangars in California and reassembled at Fort Sill in 1935. During the On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA) four phase inspections as authorized by the INF Treaty of 1988, the 20th century Lighter- Than-Air (LTA) hangar was a point of convergence by the Soviet Union prior to Revolutions of 1989 and discontinuation of the Cold War. The balloon hangar is now the home of Fort Sill Museum Aviation Annex and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The old Harrison Aviation Clinic is next to the field, it also is listed as a Historic Landmark. Facilities Henry Post AAF has one runway designated 17/35 with a concrete surface measuring 5,001 by 200 feet (1,524 x 61 m). There are no permanently assigned Army aviation units, and the facilities are operated as a military airport. The primary users of the airfield are USAF training aircraft from Sheppard AFB, Wichita Falls, TX and Dyess AFB, Abilene, TX. History The field was named in honor of pioneer aviator 2d Lieutenant Henry Post (1885‚Äì1914). Post was assigned to the 25th Infantry, and reported for aeronautical duty at the Signal Corps Aviation School, Rockwell Field, San Diego, California on 26 May 1913. On 18 December, Post set an altitude record for Air Service aviation, attaining a height of 10,500 feet. On 9 February 1914, while at Rockwell Field, he was killed in an airplane crash, after reaching an altitude of 12,140 feet. While descending, the Wright Model C, Signal Corps 10, suffered the collapse of a wing and the airframe dropped into San Diego Bay. Following this accident, the Signal Corps condemned all pusher types, essentially removing Wright brothers designs from further service. Origins The first Army aviation at Fort Sill began on 26 July 1915 when eight Curtiss JN-3 airplanes of the 1st Aero Squadron arrived from Rockwell Field, California. The squadron was ordered to Fort Sill as a result of the Tampico Affair threatened war between the United States and Mexico. However, the aviation facilities at Fort Sill consisted of little more than a grass field. Using Fort Sill as a base of operations, a detachment was flown to Brownsville, Texas in August until a proper airfield was built for the squadron at Fort Sam Houston, near San Antonio. On 26 November, the 1st Aero Squadron departed for Fort Sam Houston, from which it would eventually deploy as part of the 1916 Punitive Expedition against Mexico as a result of Pancho Villa's raid on Columbus, Texas in March 1916. World War I As a result of the United States' entry into World War I, Fort Sill was selected for a primary pilot school. Construction of some 50 buildings began to support the school. Post Field was established as an Airfield on 10 September 1917. The field covered over 700 acres and could accommodate up to 1,000 personnel. Dozens of wooden buildings served as headquarters, maintenance, and officers' quarters.National Archives of the United States: Records of the Training and Operations Group (Air Service) and the Training and Operations Division (Air Corps) Records of the Army Air Forces (AAF), (Record Group 18) 1903‚Äì64 (bulk 1917‚Äì47) The Signal Corps had been supplying observation aircraft for the United States Army Field Artillery School since 1915. In the early days of aviation, observation balloons were considered a little more reliable than Airplanes for artillery spotting. Company A 1st Balloon Squadron was assigned to the post on 24 September 1917. but was split up into the 25th, and 26th Balloon Companies. The first aircraft squadron to arrive was the 3d Aero Squadron on 29 August 1917. Although the 3d was equipped with twelve Curtiss R-4 planes, they were replaced with Curtiss JN-4Ds that were shipped in wooden crates by rail car. Post Field served as a base for flight training for the Air Service. In 1917, flight training occurred in two phases: primary and advanced. Primary training took eight weeks and consisted of pilots learning basic flight skills under dual and solo instruction with a student capacity of 300. After completion of their primary training, flight cadets were then transferred to another base for advanced training. Training units assigned to Post Field were:Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint) * Post Headquarters, Post Field, September 1917-January 1920 * 3d Aero Squadron, August 1917 (Transferred from Kelly Field, Texas) : Re-designated as Squadron \\"A\\", July 1918-January 1919 * 4th Aero Squadron, September 1917 (Transferred from Fort Sam Houston, Texas) : Re-designated as Squadron \\"B\\", July 1918-January 1919 * 80th Aero Squadron (II), March 1918 (Transferred from Rich Field, Texas) : Re-designated as Squadron \\"C\\", July 1918-January 1919 * 81st Aero Squadron (II), March 1918 (Transferred from Rich Field, Texas) : Re-designated as Squadron \\"D\\", July 1918-January 1919 * 202d Aero Squadron (II), April 1918 : Re-designated as Squadron \\"E\\", July 1918-January 1919 * 251st Aero Squadron, December 1917 : Re-designated as Squadron \\"F\\", July 1918-January 1919 * Flying School Detachment (Consolidation of Squadrons A-F), January‚ÄìSeptember 1919 With the sudden end of World War I in November 1918, the future operational status of Post Field was unknown. Cadets in flight training on 11 November 1918 were allowed to complete their training, however no new cadets were assigned to the field. Also, the separate training squadrons were consolidated into a single Flying School detachment, as many of the personnel assigned were being demobilized. Finally, flight training activities ceased in September 1919. Inter-war years With the end of World War I, in October 1919 Post Field was deactivated as an active duty airfield in accordance with sharply reduced military budgets, and a small caretaker unit was assigned to the facility for administrative reasons to support the balloon school/company. After returning from combat duty in France, a cadre of the 135th Aero Squadron (later 22d Squadron (Observation)) was assigned to Post Field as an observation squadron, supplying aircraft for the United States Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill and supported Army units at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The 135th was moved to Maxwell Field, Alabama in late 1921, and replaced by the re-activated 44th Observation Squadron. The 44th took up the observation mission for the Artillery School until it was moved to March Field, California during June, 1927; being replaced again by the 88th Reconnaissance Squadron until it was moved to Brooks Field in 1931.

Beginning in the early 1930s the Army along with the WPA was able to build permanent buildings the oldest of which, Bldg. 4908 the aircraft maintenance hangar (c.1932), still stands. In 1934 the famous balloon hangar was built to house Dirigibles. World War II In 1940 the Artillery decided that the Air Corps had outgrown such mundane chores as artillery spotting, and it was decided that it would take care of itself with its own observation aircraft, ushering in the era of the now famous grasshoppers, and Bird dogs. The Air Corps then turned over Post Field to the Army, which established the Department of Air Training there. Temporary mobilization buildings, including mainly barracks and troop support buildings like a recreation hall and post exchanges, were built in connection with the school. What was originally a five-week course was soon expanded, and special primary flight schools for prospective Field Artillery pilots were set up at Pittsburg, Kansas, and Denton, Texas. After attending one of these primary schools, pilots went to Post Field for their advanced training, which included short field procedures, and observer training. The United States Army Aviation School was added in 1945 but was transferred to Fort Rucker in 1954. The runway was not paved until after World War II had ended. Today A Republic of Singapore Air Force Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sits in a hangar at Henry Post Army Airfield Nov. 14, 2009, at Fort Sill. About 600 Singaporean soldiers and airmen are in Southwest Oklahoma participating in the three-week- long Forging Sabre combined exercise, hosted by Fort Sill, Okla. (U.S. Army photo by Jeff Crawley) There are no air units currently stationed at the airfield, however air operations for transient units are provided by permanent party personnel. Fort Sill has embarked on a new plan to support the museum in providing a more dynamic learning experience for the 200,000 military and civilian personnel who visit each year. This ambitious effort involves historic preservation, interpretive exhibits, and a new public facility. Collectively referred to as Project Millennium, projects will be undertaken as resources become available. This includes efforts to continue restoration of the historic buildings to further enhance the National Historic Landmark Area. The initiative will increase the interpretive potential of the 19th century post through living history and other educational programs. Plans include work to assemble and install the army aviation equipment and materials from the museum collections in the balloon hangar at Henry Post Army Airfield to provide interpretation for this little known aspect of Fort Sill history. The Fort Sill Army Radar Approach Control [ARAC] is the Army's Second busiest Air Traffic Control Facility, providing Radar Approach Control service to Henry Post Army Air Field, Lawton/Fort Sill Regional Airport, Duncan/Haliburton Airport and many smaller airports in the area. In 1999 the Army announced its intention to discontinue operation of the Fort Sill ARAC at Henry Post Army Airfield in Lawton, Oklahoma. Funding was provided by the Congress within the recommended level to continue the operation of the Fort Sill ARAC until such time as a staff study to determine the most cost-effective method of continuing air traffic services is concluded. The Administrator consulted with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on alternatives for continuing the necessary air traffic services provided by the Fort Sill ARAC before implementing any modifications to the current operations. Under the agreement, the Army will continue to operate the Fort Sill Army Radar Approach Control (ARAC) until three months after the Air Force installs a new digital radar in the Lawton-Fort Sill area, and a new advanced approach control automation system at Sheppard Air Force Base can provide full display of the data from the new Lawton-Fort Sill radar. The projected operational date is FY 2004. The Army will continue to operate and maintain a precision approach radar (PAR) at Fort Sill's Henry Post Field for the foreseeable future. Since the Air Force frequently uses this service at Fort Sill, the agreement states the Army will provide the Air Force two years notice if future plans call for the cessation of PAR operations at Fort Sill. The agreement calls for the Army to continue the current level of funding for the operation and maintenance of the Fort Sill ARAC until the Sheppard RAPCON assumes the approach control responsibility. The Army will continue to fund the precision approach radar equipment and manpower necessary to support PAR operations at Henry Post Field.  Notable personnel assigned * Paul W.

Known for his contributions to dynamical systems theory, he served as full professor at Instituto Nacional de Matem√°tica Pura e Aplicada from 1980 to 2016. Melo wrote numerous papers, one being a complete description of the topological behavior of 1-dimensional real dynamical systems (co-authored with Marco Martens and Sebastian van Strien).. He proved the global hyperbolicity of renormalization for r unimodal maps (co-authored with Alberto Pinto and Edson de Faria).. He was a recipient of the 2003 TWAS Prize. Biography Born on November 17, 1946, in Guap√©, Minas Gerais, Welington studied electrical engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (1969). He adopted mathematics after attending a course in the researcher of the Elon Lages Lima Institute in a colloquium in Po√ßos de Caldas, Minas Gerais. Invited by Elon to study at Instituto Nacional de Matem√°tica Pura e Aplicada he moved to Rio de Janeiro with the woman Gilza in 1970, with Jacob Palis his advisor, where Welington completed his doctorate in two years, with a thesis published in the prestigious Inventiones Mathematicae in 1972. He did his post-doctorate in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1972. He returned two years later to Brazil to make a career as a researcher at IMPA, where he stayed ever since. Appreciated by different generations of mathematicians, Welington was known and respected for his academic rigor and scientific productivity. Besides mathematics, he was passionate about sailing. On 1987 Steve Smale, Charles Pugh and Welington sailed the Pacific in a long journey on Smale's 43-foot Stardust. On his 30-foot Doisdu boat, he sailed at least a hundred days a year, mostly along Angra dos Reis's coast.

Graveldivers are small, with snake-like heads (hence the generic name). Their bodies are compact, and lack pelvic fins, with very small pectoral fins. Their range encompasses the coastal area from the Bering Sea to central California. Taxonomy and naming The generic name Scytalina is of a Greek origin, from the diminutive of skytale, meaning \\"viper\\". This refers to the snake-like head. The specific name cerdale means \\"wary one\\" or \\"the fox\\", in allusion to its agility and quick movement when disturbed. Jordan and Gilbert suggested an alternative generic name Scytaliscus due to the similarity between Scytalina and the unrelated genus Scytalinus. This name is unnecessary and is not in wide use. Description Graveldivers are small fish, reaching lengths of only , but usually not exceeding . They are long and compressed, resembling blennies. The head is snake-like, and the dorsal fins and anal fins have no soft rays, and are supported only by thin spines. Each has 41‚Äì51 spines, originating deep in the skin. They are at opposite sides of the body. The dorsal and anal fins converge at the rounded caudal fin. The pectoral fins are very small, with only about eight rays, and the pelvic fins and girdle are absent altogether. Graveldivers have no lateral lines, scales, pyloric caeca, or swim bladders. They are pinkish-brown in colour, and may bear some purple markings. The edge of the caudal (tail) fin is reddish-orange. Distribution and habitat Graveldivers are marine fish found in the cold northern and eastern Pacific Ocean, from the Bering Sea on the Alaskan coast to Diablo Cave in central California. They are demersal fish, occurring in tidal pools and rocky bottoms. They may burrow under rocks and substrates such as sand, gravel, and broken shells, hence their name. They may burrow to depths of or more. Graveldivers generally inhabit shallow intertidal and subtidal areas.

The NJHL was a member of the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association, a part of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. The winner of the NJHL was allowed to compete against the champion of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League for the Turnbull Cup and a berth into the Centennial Cup national playdowns. History The NJHL was formed in the summer of 1978 as a Junior B League which comprised the Flin Flon Bombers, Snow Lake Spartans, The Pas Lumber Kings and Thompson King Miners as a result of Flin Flon and Thompson seeking new leagues after leaving the Western Canada Junior Hockey League and Manitoba Junior Hockey League respectively. Previously, Flin Flon had experimented with a Jr. B farm team when they were playing Major Junior and had won the 1978 Baldy Northcott Trophy as provincial champions. For the 1979-80 season, the league was promoted to Junior \\"A\\". Churchill, Manitoba was interested in expanding into the league in 1980, but the team never materialized. During the 1981-82 season, the Flin Flon Bombers pulled off a perfect regular season record of 42 wins, no losses, and no ties. The Bombers were such a powerhouse in the NJHL that The Pas Huskies refused to play them in the league semi-finals. In the finals, the Bombers swept the Thompson King Miners in four games to claim the league title. Next was to challenge the Manitoba Junior Hockey League champion Fort Garry Blues. Much to the dismay of the Bombers, the Blues were from a much stronger league and crushed the Bombers in a 3-game-sweep by scores of 11-2, 9-1, and 10-4. In 1984, Flin Flon made the jump to the more talent-laden Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. The NJHL survived one more season before folding. During the last season, there was interest from groups in Melfort and Nipawin, Saskatchewan to join the league but both were eventually granted franchises in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. Cross Lake, Manitoba also showed interest in joining the league, but never did. In the final season, the Cranberry Portage Winter Hawks joined the league to help balance out the schedule. Additionally, the NJHL began the season with an interlocking schedule with the Kelsey Intermediate Hockey League, including the Thompson Hawks, Snow Lake North Stars, and Cross Lake Selects, but this schedule was complete cancelled in December when the Hawks and North Stars withdrew from the interlock. All results were thrown out at this point and the NJHL season was restarted. Late in 1984-85 season, The Pas left the league hoping to play Junior B. The finals were played between Thompson and Snow Lake, won by Thompson 4-games-to-1. In the summer the NJHL closed its doors. Thompson was still hopefully to play Junior A hockey in the region in 1986-87 or to play in the MJHL, but nothing ever transpired. From 1980 until 1985, the champion of the NJHL played the winner of the MJHL for the Turnbull Cup, but never won a series.

Feuchwanger was married to Augusta Levy and had five children. Biography Lewis Feuchtwanger was the son of a mineralogist, and inherited a taste for natural science, to which he devoted special attention at the University of Jena. After receiving his doctor of philosophy degree there in 1827, he emigrated to the United States in 1829, and settled in New York, where he opened the first German pharmacy, and also practiced medicine, being particularly active during the cholera epidemic of 1832. Subsequently, he devoted his entire attention to chemistry and mineralogy, and became engaged in the manufacture and sale of rare chemicals. He introduced in 1829 the alloy called German silver, and was the first to call the attention of the U. S. government to the availability and desirability of nickel for small coins. In 1837 he issued, by permission of the U. S. government, a large quantity of one-cent pieces in nickel of which were known as Feuchtwanger Cents, and in 1864 he had struck off a number of three-cent pieces in the same metal, but they were not put into circulation. After the great fire of 1846 he called the attention of the authorities of New York to the fact that saltpetre would explode under certain conditions. This statement created much discussion; the expression \\"Will saltpetre explode?\\" became a byword, and a play was acted at one of the theatres in which a character representing Feuchtwanger was presented. He made two large collections of minerals of which he partially sold in 1832, one of these he exhibited in London at the World's fair in 1851, and the other, he bequeathed to his daughters, was for a time on exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History in Central Park. Feuchtwanger was a member of scientific societies in this country and abroad, and contributed papers to Silliman's American Journal of Science and to the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In the 1850s to the 1870s, Feuchtwanger opened up a chemical plant because of his buying and selling of commercial quantities of minerals for use in preparing chemical preparations from the raw material. Lewis Feuchtwanger died on June 25, 1876, in New York City.

The Carta Pisana or Carte Pisane is a map probably made at the end of the 13th century, about 1275-1300, currently conserved in the D√©partement des cartes et plans at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. New research suggests that it was made a century later.See: Pujades i Bataller, Ramon Josep, (2013), The Pisana Chart. Really a primitive portolan chart made in the 13th Century?, Comite Francais de Cartographie, No. 216 (Juin 2013), pp. 17-32. It was found in Pisa, hence its name. It shows the whole Mediterranean, the Black Sea and a part of the atlantic coast, from the north of present-day Morocco (down to roughly the 33rd parallel north, with the town of Azemmour) to the present-day Netherlands, but the accuracy of the map is mostly limited to the Mediterranean. It is the oldest surviving nautical chart (that is, not simply a map but a document showing accurate navigational directions). It is a portolan chart, showing a detailed survey of the coasts, and many ports, but bears no indication on the topography or toponymy of the inland. On the map, North is on the top, in contrast to other maps of the same period such as the Hereford Mappa Mundi (ca. 1300), where East is on the top.  Origin and content  Possible places of origin for the map include Pisa, where it was found, Venetia, and Genoa, which is the conventionally recognised place of origin. The density of the ports referenced on the map is the highest for the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the lowest for that of the Ionian Sea. This is possible evidence that the map is of genoese origin, since Genoa, at this time, was a major power in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Additionally, the first textual reference to the use of such a detailed maritime chart, in 1270, is in relation to a Genoese ship. The inaccuracy of the Atlantic part of the Carta Pisana, especially when compared to its Mediterranean part, can be exemplified by its depiction of Great Britain: an irregular, rectangular shape, lying on an east‚Äìwest axis. Only six place names are indicated for Great Britain. Civitate Londra (London) is placed in the middle of the southern coast. As to the date of the map, it is partly indicated by the mention of the town of Manfredonia, which was founded by king Manfred of Sicily in 1256. The sources used in the making of the Carta Pisana are difficult to determine. The use of several dialects in the place-names indicated on the map would tend to suggest that several regional sources were compiled to make the map. Other possibilities include a hypothetical earlier, no longer extant portolan chart, or Ancient Roman cartography. However, there is absolutely no evidence supporting the existence of an earlier portolan chart, and the fact that the map's most glaring error concerns Italy would undermine the theory of an Ancient Roman influence.  Navigational aspects and relation to the compass  The map encompasses almost all of the Mediterranean inside two circles, one for the western Mediterranean, one for the eastern. These circles are divided into sixteen parts, providing the map with sixteen corresponding wind directions. Furthermore, it comprises a two- directional scale subdivided into several segments corresponding to 200, 50, 10, and 5 miles. The exact value of these \\"portolan miles\\" is difficult to calculate in present-day units, given discrepancies between geographical areas on this map and others; but it is conventionally accepted to be around 1.25 kilometers.

The student must satisfy eligibility criteria and maintain a minimum academic standard of an \\"A-\\" or 80% average over the preceding two years of study in order to qualify for the scholarship. Final decisions on the candidacy of each individual is made by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities, which has agreements with some universities that use a Pass or Fail system, such as York University does for some of its non-graded courses in the Faculty of Environmental Studies. Selections are based on reports to the ministry by an advisory agency known as the Selection Board (Ontario Graduate Scholarship), which consists of a chairperson and eight members representing five broad disciplines of study. The board meets twice a year to evaluate candidate applications for the OGS. Program An Ontario Graduate Scholarship is awarded to a student for a single two- or three-term academic year in any non-professional graduate program; the terms must be consecutive. The scholarship, which is worth $5,000 per term, is not granted for just one term. The recipient student must attend a full-time graduate program in Ontario during the course of the scholarship award, but may hold part-time employment of no more than 10 hours per week. However, students with disabilities may hold an OGS for part-time study. Of the 3,000 scholarships awarded annually, 90 are reserved for students who have received a temporary resident visa as a member of the student class under the federal Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. This is also referred to as the \\"Temporary Resident Visa Student Class\\". Others are awarded to eligible candidates who are Canadian citizens, landed immigrants or permanent residents with preference for residents of Ontario. A candidate will not be considered for an OGS if: *the candidate has been convicted of an offence under the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act, the Canada Student Loans Act, or the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act *the candidate has been convicted under the Criminal Code of fraud or theft in relation to any student assistance program or loan grant, or an award made by the Government of Ontario, the Government of Canada or the government of any other province or territory of Canada. Students may not simultaneously hold an OGS scholarship and a scholarship from any of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, or the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, or an Ontario Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology (OGSST). A student may obtain at most two OGS awards at the master's level, but not after the second year, and up to four at the doctoral level, but not after the fifth year. Funding Funding for the award is provided by the provincial government, which contributes two-thirds of the grant total, and the university attended by the student, which contributes the remaining one-third. However, some universities depend on matching private donations to offer the scholarship, and if donations are insufficient, the student is not eligible to use the award at that institution. This is because two thirds of the value of every OGS award is provided by the government of Ontario. One third of the value of every award is provided by the University from eligible matched sources. In 2003, Toronto- Dominion Bank made a $900,000 endowment donation to the University of Waterloo. The endowment established six annual awards that would provide $5,000 of matching funds for an OGS recipient at UW. The same year, Wayne and Isobel Fox donated $1 million to establish matching funding for ten yearly OGS awards. MDS Inc. donated $333,000 to The University of Western Ontario in 2005 to establish the Ron Yamada Ontario Graduate Scholarship Fund for graduate engineering students, which will award matching grants for three OGS or OGSST scholarships. In 2010, the Italian Cultural Centre of Durham donated $30,000, about one third of the total from the Oshawa Italian Recreation Club, to create an endowment for five annual OGS scholarships and eleven undergraduate scholarships for the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. The endowment enables an exchange program with the Polytechnic University of Turin, which signed a letter of intent for three scholarships. Various private funds have been established at the University of Guelph to provide matching funds for OGS scholarships to students at the university: ten for students in any program; three for students in the Ontario Veterinary College; seven for students in the Ontario Agricultural College; five for students in the College of Arts (COA), three for those in the College of Social & Applied Human Sciences (CSAHS), and one for those in either the COA or CSAHS; one for students in the College of Physical & Engineering Science; and one for students in any program except the College of Management & Economics. At The University of Western Ontario during the academic year from September 2007 to August 2008, \\"294 students received $3.1 million from the Ontario Graduate Scholarship Program\\". Application Applications are due in October to the attending university. Non-matriculating applicants apply directly to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. Some institutions suggest to all qualified undergraduate students to submit an application; the student may later decline its award if that student has no interest in pursuing graduate studies, as Ryerson University did for its 2009 application process. Candidates need not have been accepted to a graduate program by the application filing deadline, as the deadline for OGS application, as that of many federal and provincial scholarships, is before the application filing deadline of most graduate programs. The student application must be accompanied by two academic assessment reports completed by professors who act as a reference for the student. Each professor assesses several characteristics of the candidate student, specifically background preparation, originality, ability at research, research potential, industriousness, judgement, oral and written skills, and overall ability, within the top 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% or bottom 50% of students at a similar stage previously evaluated by that professor. A complete application package will include: *the application form, which includes personal data (page 1), education information (page 2), notice, consent, declaration and applicant signature (page 3), and any additional information (page 4) *official university transcripts of applicable undergraduate and graduate studies to the end of August of the year in which application is submitted *two academic assessment reports, which must be completed and signed by the referees, and which may contain attachments which must also be completed and signed by the referees *Temporary Resident Visa Student Class documentation for foreign applicants with a student visa *the student checklist, which must be signed by the applicant *a summary sheet signed by the applicant *either a Statement of Interest or a Plan of Study *a list of significant academic accomplishments *a list of awards and scholarships received by the student The student application requires a Social Insurance Numbers (SIN) for Canadian citizens; the requirement is waived for foreign applicants with a student visa, but they must supply a copy of the Temporary Resident Visa Student Class document. Personal data is retained by the ministry and is not shared with the Selection Board or panels. Modifications to the submitted application may be made by the student to the institution's graduate office, or to the Ontario Graduate Studies Officer of the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. However, modifications are limited to the applicants name, address and phone number, birthdate, student number, citizenship status, discipline code and level of study (proposed and current studies), and the number of OGS awards. Selection Board and panels Selections are based on reports to the ministry by an advisory agency known as the Selection Board (Ontario Graduate Scholarship), established on 1 September 1975, which consists of a chairman and eight board members appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario for an indefinite term. The eight members of the board must represent the humanities (2 positions), social sciences (2), applied sciences (1), biological sciences (2) and physical sciences (1), and the board's function is to meet in Toronto in November and March of each year to evaluate the dossiers of candidate applicants for the OGS. The current chair, since 26 September 2001, is Pascal van Lieshout; his term expires on 31 August 2010. The Selection Board establishes three-member panels which evaluate candidates based on the applications received; one member is selected as the chairperson. The panel will reject without qualification any application from a student that does not satisfy the eligibility criteria or is not submitted by the deadline. For each application from an eligible student, a rating sheet is completed by the panel. It consists of three sections: student identification (name, student number, level of study, and a code for the discipline of study), the panel ranking (a panel number and panel chair signature, and either successful, reversion, or unsuccessful), and the board ranking (board member signature and either successful, reversion, or unsuccessful). If two panel members differ in their assessment of a candidate by three or more points, an anomaly report is generated, requiring a conference call between the panel chair and the other two members. If the anomaly remains unresolved, the chairperson may investigate the matter and issue a final decision. The Selection Board submits to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities lists of successful and unsuccessful candidates for each of the doctoral, master's, and student visa classes, as well as a reversion list for each class. The ministry notifies successful applicants by mid-April, to which it must receive a complete Notice of Acceptance from the student by the end of June. Failure to submit the Notice of Acceptance may result in withdrawal of the scholarship by the ministry. The student may request a deferral of the award of up to 16 months for medical reasons, a maternity or paternity leave, or on compassionate grounds for exceptional circumstances. The latter is considered by the Selection Board. A deferral extension may be requested by the student from the Selection Board. Issues On 23 September 2005, the Faculty of Graduate Studies at The University of Western Ontario posted documents to an unsecured part of its website containing \\"names, social insurance numbers and Ontario Graduate Scholarship results\\" of students. It remained there until 7 October, during which time the information was accessed 14 times. The university made a formal request to the OGS program to cease using Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) for program administration; but no change was made. The university had also contacted Service Canada about granting affected students new SINs, which was denied because there was no documented fraud associated with the affected SINs.

Clinton is classified as a 3A school (Iowa's largest 48 schools), according to the Iowa High School Athletic Association and Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union; in sports where there are fewer divisions, the River Kings/Queens are always in the largest class (e.g., Class 3A for wrestling, boys soccer, and Class 2A for golf, tennis and girls soccer). The school is a member of the 10-team Mississippi Athletic Conference (known to locals as the MAC), which comprises schools from the Iowa Quad Cities, along with Burlington, Muscatine and North Scott high schools.  History  in November 1919 authorizing the construction of the current Clinton High School. The land for the school located on Eighth Avenue South was donated by the family of William Folwell Coan Sr. The deed provided that the school would be named Clinton High School and the athletic field named Coan Field. Construction on the high school started in 1920. The high school opened in September 1921, although some construction was still taking place. In 1968, a large fire caused extensive damage to the high school. The building was extensively remodeled in 1958 at a cost of $108,812. Firemen managed to save the adjoining industrial arts wing, which was also built in 1958 at a cost of $522, 049. It however was damaged by fire Dec. 31 and repair of the structure and replacement is expected to cost more than $100,000. Yourd gym, located directly west of the main high school building, also escaped the flames. It, too, was built in 1958 at a cost of $876,623. In 2012, a large addition to the high school was completed with the main function of providing updated and additional athletic facilities. These upgrades included a new pool, auxiliary gym, and wrestling room. In 2017, the district purchased the former athletic complex of Ashford University. The complex features a turf football field, a nine-lane track, field event facilities, locker and medical facilities, and other amenities. It was estimated that the seating capacity of the bleachers could be 500 to 700. According to tax records from 2016, the property the district is planning to purchase at 1650 S. 14th St. was assessed at $5.086 million. The land was valued at $491,050, while the structures were valued at a little more than $4.595 million. The reported cost to the district for the facility was $200,000. On Monday, February 26, 2018, the district school board finalized a deal with the China-based Confucius International Education Group that brings at least 72 international students to the Iowa school. The students will stay in the former dorms of Mount St. Clare College and Ashford University. The CIEG will pay the district the state aid rate of about $6,700 a year per student, as well as providing accommodations for the international students.

Although the English duo would have a string of successful records in the United States through the mid-1960s, this song was their only hit in their native land. History The song was written in 1962 by Chad Stuart, who comprised Chad & Jeremy with Jeremy Clyde; it is the first song Stuart ever wrote. Stuart shares the song's writing credit with Wendy Kidd, the manager of a band Stuart belonged to at the time of the song's writing; according to Stuart, Kidd was given the songwriting credit in return for allowing him to compose \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" on her piano. Kidd also facilitated Stuart's being hired as a staff writer at Rogers Music, which published \\"Yesterday's Gone\\", although the song remained unrecorded until Stuart and Clyde began performing as a duo, eventually recording \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" in July 1963 in a session at Abbey Road Studios produced and arranged by John Barry, who'd discovered Chad & Jeremy at a London club and signed them to Ember Records, a newly formed independent label in which Barry was a partner. According to Chad Stuart, John Barry was unhappy with the duo's first attempts to record their vocal for \\"Yesterday's Gone\\": \\"he told us...we sounded like a locker room full of football players...in the end in desperation he said: 'Whisper it', so we kind of backed off a bit and so that sort of slightly sotto voce sound came about\\". Chart performance \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" was the British duo's only UK hit.Released 27 September 1963, \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" entered the UK Top 50 on the chart dated 30 November 1963 and remained on the chart for seven weeks and peaked at No. 37. The follow-up single \\"Like I Love You Today\\" was released in January 1964 with no evident reaction. Chad Stuart would recall: \\"There was just no way a little independent label could compete in those days...John Barry bought himself out of his contract and we were stuck. I think we would've broken up then and there except for the fact that Noel Rogers, who published 'Yesterday's Gone' fenced it off to this other company in America called World Artists\\". Stuart is referring to the Pittsburgh-based World Artists Records which released \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" in the US in March 1964 after label president Lou Guarino heard the single while visiting Great Britain in search of local tracks which World Artists might profitably release, the \\"British Invasion\\" of the US music scene then being in full swing.The Pittsburgh Press 21 November 1972 Record Businesses Spinning Here p. 38 (Yesterday's Gone\\" had already had one international release: by Australia's Festival Records in February 1964, which was not a success.) It rose to No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1964, the first of eleven singles to chart in America. Chad & Jeremy would subsequently place three singles in the US Top 20, but only their one Top Ten hit, \\"A Summer Song\\", rivals \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" as the duo's signature song. The American success of \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" occasioned a re-release of the track in Australia, Billboard: 6 June 1964 (vol. 76, No. 23), p.29 where it charted over the summer of 1964 with a No. 26 peak, and a major label cover in the UK, where in March 1964 Pye Records released a version of \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" recorded by the Overlanders with Tony Hatch producing; the Overlanders' version did not chart in the UK but was picked up by Hickory Records for US release in May 1964 and became a regional hit reaching No. 75 that July, marking the only Billboard Hot 100 appearance of the Overlanders which preceded that group's sole charting in their native UK (with the No. 1 \\"Michelle\\") by almost two years. Other recordings \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" has also been recorded by the Boxmasters, the Browns, the Carter Family, Brenda Lee, the Osborne Brothers, Anita Sarawak and Roy Drusky. A mid-1960s recording by the Bee Gees is featured on their 1998 Brilliant From Birth compilation CD. Translated as \\"Pas Aujourd'hui\\", \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" charted in France at No. 94 in France for Les Missiles (fr) in the autumn of 1964. \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" was also rendered in Spanish in 1964 as \\"En el verano\\" by Los Hermanos Carri√≥n (es).

After her death, Denver's Department of Human Services said that they would make improvements to their agency. Death On September 21, 2007, the Denver Police Department received a 911 call from Miriam Gallegos, the mother of Neveah. She claimed that her daughter had been kidnapped, having been snatched from her arms. Gallegos gave a description of the supposed kidnapper and the car he was in, adding that he was the passenger and that she was unable to see the driver. Gallegos gave police permission to enter her apartment in order for them to obtain a photograph of her daughter to aid them in their search. Once inside the apartment police noticed a \\"paper towel on the floor of the living room that had blood or some other type of bodily fluid on it\\". Later that day, Gallegos agreed to answer questions from the police. She told them she had received a telephone call at work, the same day as she made the 911 call. The call was from her boyfriend who she named as Angel Montoya. He told her to come home but did not explain why. Gallegos left work and walked home. When she entered her apartment she discovered her daughter, Neveah, who was not breathing. She claimed she had tried to \\"put air into Neveah\\" but was unable to revive her. She informed the police that she and Montoya decided not to call an ambulance but instead opted to put Neveah's corpse into a \\"white trash bag\\", which they then put inside a \\"black trash bag\\", and placed the bagged body into a duffel bag. She claimed that she and Montoya left the building and he, with the duffel bag, went a different way. During the interview police showed Gallegos a photo of Montoya, whose full name is Angel Ray Montoya. She confirmed the photograph was of him. Neveah, dressed in red sweat pants, a red shirt with a cartoon character on it and pink tennis shoes, was found on September 24, 2007, three days after being reported missing, in a white plastic trash bag under a tree stump in a ravine. She was found roughly from the couple's apartment. At the time cause of death was undetermined, though it was later determined to be asphyxiation. On September 25, 2007, a candlelight vigil was held for her, with dozens of people placing flowers and stuffed toys in the ravine where Neveah was found. A permanent memorial was dedicated to Neveah on November 2, 2007. Angel Ray Montoya Montoya was born on January 19, 1985. In December 2000, he was charged with indecent exposure to minors. In 2003, he failed to register as a sex offender and was charged with a misdemeanor to which he pleaded guilty. In 2005, he was charged with false imprisonment and child abuse, which he pleaded down to one count of misdemeanor child abuse. He was given a 270-day jail sentence that was suspended and 18 months of supervised probation. Officials had also expressed concerns about Montoya living with his niece and nephew, aged one and three, at his mother‚Äôs house but did not follow through with the concerns.  Miriam Gallegos  Miriam Gallegos also has a criminal history, having been convicted on marijuana charges in 2006. Criminal proceedings Montoya had previously been investigated in July 2006 for sexual assault that involved vaginal penetration on Nevaeh, then 23 months old. But the case was subsequently dropped due to Miriam Gallegos not cooperating with detectives. Subsequent to Neveah's death, Angel Ray Montoya was arrested for first-degree murder. Miriam Gallegos was arrested on charges of being an accessory to murder, false reporting, and fatal child abuse. The couple was released October 1, 2007 without being charged pending an autopsy. Montoya was again arrested in late October 2007 for failing to register as a sex offender. A news report from March 2008 stated that Montoya had again failed to register and was on the run. Nevaeh's grandmother, Janet Gallegos, having grown frustrated with the lack of arrest of Angel Montoya and her daughter Miriam, reached out to attorney/author Donna Thomas for help in procuring justice for Nevaeh. Thomas had a grand jury convened.Denver Post May 9, 2009 On April 22, 2009, Montoya and Miriam Gallegos were indicted for Neveah's death. Montoya was indicted on one count of first-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death. Gallegos was indicted May 6, 2009, on one count of child abuse resulting in death and being an accessory to a crime. Montoya, already in custody on another charge when indicted for Neveah's death, was being held in jail without bond, and Gallegos was being held on $500,000 bond. Prosecutors considered seeking the death penalty. On October 30, 2009, Montoya and Miriam Gallegos both pleaded not guilty in Neveah's death. On January 6, 2011, Miriam Gallegos was sentenced to 12 years in prison and five years of parole for child abuse resulting in death. On May 15, 2012, Angel Montoya was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for first-degree murder, child abuse resulting in death and abuse of a corpse.  Appeal  Montoya appealed his first degree murder conviction. The Colorado Court of Appeals upheld his conviction on 20 August 2015.

In 2010, the species was confirmed as separate from the olive thrush (Turdus olivaceus) due to genetic differences. Their ranges do not overlap. The southern and northern populations may be distinct species. The Abyssinian thrush is found in Eritrea and other parts of the Horn of Africa, as well as an area to the southeast extending from the African Great Lakes region to north eastern Zambia and Malawi. Description In Debre Berhan, Ethiopia It is long. This variable forest thrush is generally darker than the African thrush and has an orange (not yellow) bill. It is also darker than the Kurrichane thrush and has no malar stripes. Generally the birds get darker at higher altitudes. Distribution, habitat and habits The Abyssinian thrush occurs in the highlands of eastern Africa from South Sudan south to northern Mozambique. Its habitat includes forests woodlands, exotic plantations, parks and gardens. This species is a typical member of the genus Turdus but its habits and biology have been little studied, as it was considered to be a subspecies of olive thrush. Taxonomy The Abyssinian thrush was considered to be part of the olive thrush but that species has now been split and is regarded as a superspecies, members of which include the Taita thrush, Karoo thrush, Usambara thrush and Somali thrush.

He also had assignments in China and Guatemala. He became a member of the U. S. Geological Survey in 1879 when it was first organized. Biography Hague was the son of William Hague, a clergyman. He graduated from Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in 1863. He then spent three years in Germany, studying at the universities of G√∂ttingen and Heidelberg, and at the Freiberg Mining Academy. In 1867 he returned to the United States, and was appointed assistant geologist on the U. S. geological exploration of the 40th parallel under Clarence King. He then went to California, and spent the winter of 1867/68 in Virginia City, Nevada, studying the surface geology of the Comstock Lode and the chemistry of the amalgamation process as practised there, and known as the ‚ÄúWashoe process‚Äù. The results of this study were published in volume iii. of the report of the exploration, under the title of ‚ÄúChemistry of the Washoe Process.‚Äù He also contributed to the same volume a chapter on the geology of the White Pine mining district, in which there was first brought to notice the great development of Devonian rocks in the Great Basin of Utah and Nevada. In volume ii. ‚Äî ‚ÄúDescriptive Geology‚Äù ‚Äî of the report of the exploration, which was the joint work of Hague and Samuel F. Emmons, there is given the results of a detailed geological survey across the Cordilleras of North America, from the Great Plains to the Sierra Nevada range in California. This work included a geological atlas of maps and sections, which was completed after a great deal of hardship, the map of the Great Basin being accomplished before the completion of either the Union or Central Pacific Railroad. On the termination of this work in 1877, he received the appointment of government geologist of Guatemala, and traveled extensively over the republic, visiting the principal mining regions and the centres of volcanic activity. In 1878 he was engaged by the Chinese government to examine gold, silver, and lead mines in northern China. On the organization of the U. S. Geological Survey in 1879, he returned to the United States, and became one of its geologists. He was sent to Nevada, and made a report on the ‚ÄúGeology of the Eureka District.‚Äù In 1883 he was made geologist of the Yellowstone Park division, and assigned to the study of the geysers of that district in connection with the extinct volcanic regions of the Rocky Mountains. He was a member of scientific societies both in the United States and Europe and in 1885 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He received an Sc.D. degree from Columbia University in 1901, and an LL.D. degree from Aberdeen University. He was a member of the commission appointed by the National Academy of Sciences at the request of the United States Government in 1896 to prepare plans for the National Forest preserves. He was vice president of the International Congresses of Geologists held in Paris in 1900, in Stockholm in 1910 and in Toronto in 1913.

L. goliath is one of the largest mollusks of the Western Atlantic Ocean, and also one of the largest species among the Strombidae. It was once considered endemic to Brazil, but specimens have also been recently found in the waters of Barbados.Oxenford, H.A. A giant leap? Goliath conch, a Brazilian endemic species is found in Barbados. Journal of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society LVII: 192-201 Brazilian common names for this species include b√∫zio de chap√©u or b√∫zio (in Cear√° state), and b√∫zio de aba or buzo in (Bahia state). L. goliath is considered closely related to the queen conch, Lobatus gigas. Taxonomy This species was first named as Strombus goliath by German theologian Johann Samuel Schr√∂ter in 1805. It is named after the biblical character Goliath, who is traditionally considered to have been of tremendous size. The family Strombidae has undergone an extensive taxonomic revision recently and many subgenera, including Eustrombus, were elevated to genus level by some authors. Petuch recombined this species as Titanostrombus goliath in 2004, and Landau et al. recombined it as Lobatus goliath in 2008. The type locality of this species is Paracuru beach, north of Fortaleza, in Cear√° state (Brazil). Phylogeny The phylogenetic relationships among the Strombidae have been mainly accessed on two occasions, by Simone (2005) and Latiolais (2006).Latiolais J. M., Taylor M. S., Roy K. & Hellberg M. E. (2006). \\"A molecular phylogenetic analysis of strombid gastropod morphological diversity\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 41: 436-444. . PDF However, Lobatus goliath was only included in Simone's analysis. Simone proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) based on an extensive morpho-anatomical analysis of representatives of Aporrhaidae, Strombidae, Xenophoridae and Struthiolariidae, which included L. goliath. With the exception of Lambis and Terebellum, the remaining taxa were previously allocated within the genus Strombus, including L. goliath. However, according to Simone, only Strombus gracilior, Strombus alatus and Strombus pugilis, the type species, remained within Strombus, as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor). The remaining taxa were previously considered as subgenera, and were elevated to genus level by Simone in the end of his analysis. The genus Eustrombus (now considered a synonym of Lobatus), in this case, included Eustrombus gigas (now considered a synonym of Lobatus gigas) and Eustrombus goliath (= L. goliath), which were thus considered closely related. Distribution Lobatus goliath is found along the northeastern and southeastern coast of Brazil, including several Brazilian states, such as Cear√°, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Bahia and Espirito Santo and insular regions, such as Abrolhos Marine National Park. Since October 2008, a small population of both juvenile and adult specimens of Lobatus goliath were reported by fishermen to have been established in at least two locations along the west coast of Barbados. According to Professor Hazel A. Oxenford of the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, the means by which Lobatus goliath came to dwell in Barbadian waters are not entirely clear; but that the most likely explanation was that Goliath conch larvae were brought over from Brazilian to Barbadian waters by an 'extreme oceanographic event' involving the North Brazilian Current (NBC). Oxenford also assessed that the species was not invasive and unlikely to pose a threat to native marine flora and fauna, but opined that overfishing could cause severe depletion of its numbers. Shell description The maximum reported length for an adult shell of Lobatus goliath is 380 mm (15 in).Welch J. J. (2010). \\"The \\"Island Rule\\" and Deep-Sea Gastropods: Re- Examining the Evidence\\". PLoS ONE 5(1): e8776. . The goliath conch has a very large, heavy and solid shell, with a very conspicuous, widely flaring and thickened outer lip. The stromboid notch is rather inconspicuous in adult individuals, but it can be identified as a secondary anterior indentation to the right of the siphonal canal in a non-sinistral shell, assuming it is viewed ventrally, with its anterior end pointing down. Unlike the closely related queen conch, Lobatus gigas, the aperture of the shell of the Goliath conch is colored tan, and not pink. L. goliath has also a shorter spire and duller spines as compared to the queen conch, and the outer lip frequently expands far beyond the length of the spire in the shells of adult individuals.  Habitat  The minimum recorded depth for this species is 0 m, and the maximum recorded depth is 50 m. Human uses The flesh of the goliath conch is edible. However the shell has recently become the main reason for the fishery. This is because the shell is a popular decorative object which is widely utilized in handicrafts and commonly sold as a souvenir in local markets and craft stores in several regions of Brazil. This is despite the fact that some authors have warned about the risks to this species of overexploitation and even extinction. In response to depletion of Lobatus goliath numbers, the species was included in Annex II of the Brazilian List of Species Threatened by Overexploitation since 2005.Ministerio do Meio Ambiente (2005).

Krokar, \\"Maps in the Service of an Anti-Ottoman Crusade\\", Imago Mundi 60:1:23-38 (2008) p.29Ostapchuk, p. 92  Biography = Background  According to Yahya's own writings, when his father, Murad III , became Sultan, he followed the Ottoman custom of executing all of his brothers (potential rival claimants to the Ottoman throne). Yahya's mother Queen Safiye Sultan was concerned that this could also eventually happen to him after the death of his father, so he was smuggled out of the empire, first to Greece, and then to present-day Bulgaria. He was then supposedly baptized at an Orthodox Christian monastery, where he lived for the next eight years of his life.Kosovo, A Short History (1998), Noel Malcolm -- Harper Perennial - pp. 121 - 122  Battle for Ottoman throne  Yahya's narrative then claims that eventually, Yahya's two older brothers died, but in 1603, since Yahya had escaped the country to avoid fratricide, his nephew Ahmed I became the Ottoman sultan. Yahya believed that as the next oldest son of Murad III, he was next in line to be Ottoman Sultan and felt cheated out of his rightful destiny. He would dedicate the rest of his life to gaining the Ottoman throne. However, the standard Ottoman practice at the time for determining the succession was not birth order of sons; instead the Ottoman laws of succession to the throne stated that after the death of their father, the Ottoman princes would fight among themselves until one emerged triumphant. From 1603 on, Yahya made frequent trips to northern and western Europe to gain support for his claim to the throne (visiting Florence, Madrid, Rome, Krak√≥w, Antwerp, Prague, and other cities). At one point he managed to win the support of the Tatar Khan Shahin, and of the Cossacks as well. Between 1614 and 1617, he schemed with Serbian Orthodox Christian bishops in the Sanjak of Prizren and Western Roman Catholic bishops and leaders as part of his strategy to gain the Ottoman throne. A few years later, with the assistance of Russian and Ukrainian cossacks, he led a fleet of 130 ships and unsuccessfully attacked Constantinople. He died in 1648 or 1649 on the Montenegrin coast, where he was involved in a rebellion organized by the Roman Catholic bishops of Skodra-and-Bar. Family Yahya was married to Anna Cat(t)erina, the daughter of Duke Peter, Count of Drisht, in the early 1630s, when Yahya started calling himself Duke of that region. Anna Caterina was supposedly descended from the national Albanian hero Skanderbeg. They had two children, Maurice (born 1635) and Elena (born 1638).Giammanco, p. 43, 60 References Sources  * * * * * * , reprinted in 2013 by BiblioLife * * * * * * Dorothy M.

It is named for the French L'Atalante, one of the oceanographic research vessels involved in its discovery in 1993. L'Atalante and its neighbors the Urania and Discovery deep hyper saline anoxic basins (DHABs) are at most 35,000 years old. They were formed by Messinian evaporite salt deposits dissolving out of the Mediterranean Ridge and collecting in abyssal depressions about deep. L'Atalante is the smallest of the three; its surface begins at about below sea level. Description The L'Atalante basin's salinity is near saturation at 365 (about 8 times that of ordinary seawater), which prevents it from mixing with the oxygenated waters above; therefore, it is completely anoxic. The approximately halocline between the seawater above and brine below teems with bacterial and archaeal cells: they are chemoautotrophs, which feed on ammonia from the brine but cannot function without some oxygen. Members of archaeal anaerobic methane oxidizers group 1 (ANME-1) and haloarchaea are found only in the halocline zone. No group of organisms manages to prosper in all three zones. In the brine, there are fewer cells; extremophiles predominate, including members of the deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeota (DHVEs), Methanohalophilus and Proteobacteria. Eukaryotes are also found in l'Atalante, including ciliates (45%), dinoflagellates (21%) and choanoflagellates (10%). Lifeforms The dark gray anoxic sediments at the bottom of L'Atalante lake are covered with a loose black layer. Microbes found in the sediments are almost all (90%) various species of Bacillus. In 2010, three metazoan species, all in the Loricifera phylum, were discovered living in the sediment, the first multicellular lifeforms known to live entirely without oxygen.

In 1896 he became the leader of a group known as the 'Companions of the Holy Savior', which was associated with St. Elizabeth parish. McGarvey had been mentored by Henry Percival along with William Walter Webb who became president of Nashotah House. During the first few years there was a close association between Nashotah and St. Elizabeth parish. In 1906 Joseph Barry took over as president of Nashotah; he was an advocate of ritualism, but also anti-Roman. He was suspicious of the Companions, and in 1907 a dispute arose over the 'open pulpit' resolution. In the fallout McGarvey and many others joined the Roman Catholic Church, including 3 teachers and 5 students at Nashotah House. This resulted in a backlash against ritualism in the Episcopal Church. Bishop Charles Chapman Grafton and others helped to counter the backlash.The Catholic Movement in the American Episcopal Church by George DeMille pp. 100-104  References  Sources  * The Catholic Movement in the American Episcopal Church by George E.

Unlike most contemporary countries, such as France, Great Britain or the Holy Roman Empire, there was little government interference (censorship or monopolies) there.John Christian Laursen, New essays on the political thought of the Huguenots of the Refuge, BRILL, 1995, , Google Print, p.73, 94-5 Many Huguenots were exiled to the Netherlands during the reign of Louis XIV, and the numbers of French refugees increased with the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Several exiles begun publishing French-language (as it was both an international language and their own - see lingua franca) newspapers in various European cities covering political news in France and Europe. Read by the European elites, in France these papers were called \\"Foreign gazettes\\". Contents and history The Courier had a circulation of 1430 in 1793 and 530 in 1801.Barker, Burrows, 2002, Google Print, p.26 It was heavily influenced by the Prussian authorities, and seen by some as a Prussian propaganda outlet.Barker, Burrows, 2002, Google Print, p.33-34 It was, nonetheless, much freer when it came to reporting events outside Prussia, for example, in France.Jeremy D.

She was 21 years old and had been married less than eighteen months when she died of thirst on No. 5 Island in the Howick Group now called Watson‚Äôs Island north of Cape Flattery in Far North Queensland, Australia, in 1881. She, with her four-month-old baby, Ferrier, and a wounded Chinese workman, Ah Sam, had drifted for eight days and some forty miles in a cut-down ship's water tank, used for boiling sea slugs, after mainland Aboriginal people had attacked her absent husband's b√™che de mer station on Lizard Island. Her diary describing their last days was found with their remains in 1882, and Watson became an emblem of pioneer heroism for many Queenslanders. Early life Mary Watson was born at Fiddler's Green outside St Newlyn East near Truro, Cornwall, England, on 17 January 1860, the daughter of Mary Phillips and Thomas Oxnam, and migrated to Queensland with her family in 1877. Having accepted a position as a governess with an hotelier's family, at eighteen she travelled from Maryborough to the isolated port of Cooktown, where she met and married a b√™che de mer fisherman, Captain Robert F. Watson, in May 1880. Life on Lizard Island Robert Watson took her with him to set up a fishing station on Lizard Island, then otherwise uninhabited. In September 1880, he left Watson and their son behind with two Chinese servants known as Ah Sam and Ah Leung, while he and his partner Percy Fuller made an extended fishing trip in their luggers. Attack A few weeks later a party of mainland Aboriginal Guugu Yimithirr people made one of their habitual seasonal trips by canoe to the island, where Robert Watson had set up his household in a stone structure close to a small creek, the island's only supply of fresh water. Watson had probably also inadvertently trespassed on an indigenous ceremonial ground normally taboo to women and children. The Aboriginal people attacked Ah Sam, who suffered seven spear wounds, and Ah Leung was killed in a vegetable garden he was tending. Watson frightened off the group by firing a shotgun and then, with a small supply of food and water, put to sea in the iron sea cucumber tank, hoping to be picked up by a passing vessel. The party drifted from 2 to 7 October, occasionally landing on reefs and islets. Mary's final diary entry ended 'No water. Near dead with thirst.'Her final diary entry mistakenly dated September 11 instead of October 10. When passing fishing vessels reported the wreck of Mrs Watson's stone cottage, and fires burning on the island, it was assumed that Watson had been kidnapped or killed. Mounted police and native troopers under Inspector Hervey Fitzgerald from Cooktown shot a number of coastal Cape York people‚Äîpossibly as many as 150‚Äî from three mainland groups in retaliation. None of those shot, it would be claimed afterwards, was directly involved in the events. Grave of Mrs Watson at the Cooktown Cemetery, 1986 Remains found The remains of Watson and her baby were found some months later among the mangroves on No. 5 Howick Island, still in the iron tank, but now covered with fresh rainwater from a recent tropical downpour. Ah Sam had died on the beach nearby. A concealed spring existed on the islet, but they had not found it. When the bodies were returned to Cooktown, a procession of 650 escorted them to their burial at Two Mile Cemetery (now Cooktown Cemetery), on the road to the Palmer River goldfields.  Legacy  Mrs. Watsons Memorial at Cooktown, circa 1906 Five years later a public subscription was raised to fund the Mary Watson's Monument, a marble drinking fountain in the main street, completed in 1886. The James Cook Historical Museum in Cooktown holds a replica of the iron tank. Dramatic works In the intervening years Watson's story was retold in numerous newspaper and folk accounts, including heroic poems, usually with little attention given to the Aboriginal and Chinese aspect of the events. A highly dramatic version of the story has been told by Australian author Ion Idriess in one of his a lesser-known titles The Opium Smugglers (1948), and was touched upon by Robert Drewe in his novel The Savage Crows (1976). Australian painter Alan Oldfield's series of paintings 'The Story of Mrs Watson, 1881', begun in 1986 and exploring the spiritual dimensions of the events, are now in the permanent collection of the Cairns Art Gallery, North Queensland. An Arthur C Clarke character in his 1963 novel Dolphin Island accurately retells the tale mentioning both Aboriginal people and Chinese servants changing only the island's name to Dolphin Island.

Megiddo. Linear-time algorithms for linear programming in R3 and related problems. SIAM J. Comput., 12:759-776, 1983. The basic idea of the method is a recursive procedure in which at each step the input size is reduced (\\"pruned\\") by a constant factor . As such, it is a form of decrease and conquer algorithm, where at each step the decrease is by a constant factor. Let be the input size, be the time complexity of the whole prune-and-search algorithm, and be the time complexity of the pruning step. Then obeys the following recurrence relation: : T(n) = S(n) + T(n(1-p)). This resembles the recurrence for binary search but has a larger term than the constant term of binary search. In prune and search algorithms S(n) is typically at least linear (since the whole input must be processed). With this assumption, the recurrence has the solution . This can be seen either by applying the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences or by observing that the times for the recursive subproblems decrease in a geometric series. In particular, Megiddo himself used this approach in his linear time algorithm for the linear programming problem when the dimension is fixedNimrod Megiddo, Linear Programming in Linear Time When the Dimension Is Fixed, 1984 and for the minimal enclosing sphere problem for a set of points in space.

What that's done over the years is made black people lose any representation of themselves.

Monday 6 October 2003 http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2003/oct/06/theatre.race The continuing themes in his writing bring a sharp focus on contemporary British society and how the various groups and generations interlock or collide. Mark Norfolk's theatre debut came in 1998 when as part of Black History Month his play, Fair As The Dark Get was staged at the Albany Theatre, and closely followed by Buy Your Leave the next year. He then wrote and directed Diary Of Somebody (2000) a short film which won an LFVDA Production Award (London Film & Video Development Agency) and followed that with a low budget, digital feature film Love Is Not EnoughLove Is Not Enough Time Out Review, Tom CharityThe British Films Catalogue http://www.britfilms.com/britishfilms/catalogue/browse/?search=1&y;=all&tp;=all&s;=mark+norfolk which premiered on 10 September 2001 to a sold out audience at the Curzon Soho Cinema, London as part of the BFM International Film Festival. Time Out film critic Tom Charity wrote \\"You could call it an avant garde deconstruction of independent film practice and process ‚Äì or you could call it a piss-take. It's a shambles, but engagingly so. I laughed lots.\\"Time Out Review ITV's popular film show, Movie Nights called it \\"a highlight of the festival\\". In 2002 Love is Not Enough opened at the same cinema. Norfolk's play, Knock Down Ginger was produced at the Warehouse Theatre after being selectedhttp://www.indielondon.co.uk/theatre/t_ipfestival_tbastory.html for its International Playwriting Festival in June 2002. The play was nominated for the Arts Council's Eclipse Award For Combating Racism Through Theatre and was shortlisted for the Verity Bargate playwriting award,The Guardian, 6 October 2003,http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2003/oct/06/theatre.race later the same year it was staged in Urbino, Italy, opening the Premio Candoni Festival of New Writing and won a Croydon Guardian Culture Award.Premio Candoni Festival Catalogue. http://www.unfilmperlapace.it/catalog08.pdf The play, directed by Jeffery Kissoon, starred Judith Jacob, Sylvester Williams and marked the stage debut for Troy Glasgow. In 2002 he took part in the Soho Theatre Writers' Attachment Programme where he developed Wrong Place. The play went into production directed by artistic director, Abigail Morris and featuring Mark Theodore, Larrington Walker and Geoffrey Burton, at the Soho Theatre the following year.BBC London http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/entertainment/theatre/wrongplace_diary.shtml 2003 also saw the start of an ongoing film and theatre collaboration with actor and director, Jeffery Kissoon with whom he later worked, most notably on Naked Soldiers (2010) http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/28376/naked- soldiers featuring Ewart James Walters, Adam Sopp and Elisabeth Dahl at the Warehouse Theatre;OffWestenddotcom http://www.offwestend.com/index.php/plays/view/4106 and the next year Where The Flowers Grow (2011) http://comelime.thisislime.net/interviews/june2011/mark-norfolk.html featuring Ashley Gerlach and Jodie Richardson. In 2013 Norfolk was a co-writer of Blair's Children http://www.theartsdesk.com/theatre/blairs-children-cockpit- theatre at the Cockpit Theatre with April De Angelis, Anders Lustgarten, Georgia Fitch and Paula B. Stanic. In 2016 Mark worked with Jeffery Kissoon on adapting William Shakespeare's Hamlet https://www.blacktheatrelive.co.uk/tours/hamletfor the first ever all-black cast of the play in the UK which toured nationally for Black Theatre Live. The production was also noted for having an all-black creative team. In the same year Mark adapted Hamlet https://infoglobi.com/pervjetori-i-400te-i- shekspirit-shfaqet-premiera-princi-i/ for an Albanian language contemporary version titled Princi I, that he also directed at the Dodona Theatre in Pristina, Kosovo. Norfolk's collaboration with Jeffery Kissoon escalated when, as Kazimba Theatre, they staged his play Dare To Do (The Bear Maxim) http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/dare-to-do-the-the-space-15964 based on Kweku Adoboli the 'rogue banker' who was convicted of perpetrating the then, largest trading loss in British banking history'. The production, staged at The Space, a venue literally under the shadow of the banking industry on the Isle of Dogs in east London, was notable for its use of non- binary casting when former backing vocalist and singer, Jaye Ella-Ruth took the title role and when Adoboli took part in an after-show question and answer session in the midst of his own personal deportation battle with the UK government. Rehearsals for Dare To Do took place in Bay 56, a unit within the Village off Portobello Market, West London, a space occupied by the local community in response to the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy. This association with Portobello Road ignited a relationship with The Muse Gallery in Portobello Road where Kissoon and Norfolk under the Kazimba Theatre banner would produce regular readings of new plays including The Misclarification Of Sulieman Dewani, Dinner For Bono, What A' Fe Yu' https://www.actorscentre.co.uk/theatre/what-afe-youwritten by Mark Norfolk; and Birdbath http://www.themuseat269.com/whats-on/detail/170/readings-at-the- museby Leonard Melfi.

(n√©e Cadron, January 27, 1794 ‚Äì April 5, 1864), also known as Marie of the Nativity, was a Canadian widow and midwife who undertook the charitable care of unwed and struggling mothers between 1840 and 1864. Out of this work, she became the foundress of the Congregation of the Sisters of Misericorde. The cause for her canonization is now being studied in the Vatican. Pope Francis declared her \\"Venerable\\" in 2013. Cadron- Jett√© was born and raised in Lavaltrie, Quebec, and in 1811 married Jean-Marie Jett√©. They had 11 children, several of whom died young. In 1827 she moved to Montreal and in 1832 her husband died of cholera. From 1840, in collaboration with Ignace Bourget (then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Montreal), she engaged in the charitable care of unwed mothers. At this time in Montreal, unwed mothers and those associating with them attracted a significant social stigma. Cadron-Jett√© operated initially out of her own home and the homes of her children, and later, with the aid of other women, worked from a series of buildings known as the Hospice de Sainte-P√©lagie. In 1848, she took religious vows, along with several other women, and founded a Roman Catholic religious institute known as the Sisters of Misericorde, dedicated to the care of unwed mothers and their children. In 1849 she obtained formal midwifery qualifications. In 1853 the Misericorde Sisters built a convent on the corner of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint-Andr√© Street, and she lived there the remainder of her life. Cadron-Jett√© died in 1864. After her death, Ignace Bourget, with whom she had worked closely throughout her life, proposed that Cadron-Jett√© be considered for canonization by the Roman Catholic Church. Over a century later, in 1989, the proposal was put into effect and her canonization cause was opened.  Early life  Rosalie Cadron was born in Lavaltrie, Quebec on January 27, 1794, the older of two daughters. Her father was Antoine Cadron, a farmer, and her mother Rosalie Roy, a midwife.Bates et al (2005), p.68. Her sister was Sophie Cadron (born March 21, 1806). Her family was Roman Catholic and shortly after birth she was baptized by the Abb√© Louis Lamotte.Gr√©goire (2007), p.13. She lived at a family home on the Rue Notre-Dame in Lavaltrie until 1822. Cadron undertook brief education while boarding at a convent located in Pointe-aux-Trembles in east Montreal, but returned home due to loneliness after only a few weeks. She did not learn to read until later in life, and appears to have never learned to write.Gr√©goire (2007), p.14. After returning from the convent, she was educated at home in housekeeping, sewing and crafts.Gr√©goire (2007), p.15. In 1806 Cadron took First Communion. At the age of 16 or 17, Cadron met voyageur Jean-Marie Jett√© (1778- 1832), a brother of her uncle by marriage, Paul Jett√©, whose father was a blacksmith,Picard, Michelle Maison Rosalie-Cadron √† Lavaltrie; 2014.Genealogy of Canada \\"Genealogy Joseph Jette\\". possibly while at a family gathering; they married October 7, 1811 at the Church of Lavaltrie. Rosalie Cadron took her husband's name and was known as Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©. Jean- Marie moved into Cadron-Jett√©'s parents' house with her, as was the custom, and undertook a new career as a farmer. In 1811, that house, along with the surrounding land and outbuildings, was given to Cadron-Jett√© and Jean-Marie by Cadron-Jett√©'s parents, on the condition that the parents be allowed to live there until their death, and that Cadron-Jett√© and Jean-Marie assume the care of Cadron-Jett√©'s sister Sophie until her age of majority.Gr√©goire (2007), p.16. Between 1812 and 1832 Cadron-Jett√© and Jean-Marie had 11 children, five of whom died young (four prior to Jean-Marie's death, and one afterwards, in 1836).O'Malley (2004), p.142. The children were Jean-Marie Junior (born 1812), Marie-Rose (born 1813), Pierre (born 1815), Francois (born 1817), L√©ocadie (born 1819), Joseph-L√©onard (born 1819), an anonymous stillbirth (1823), Marie Edwige (born 1825 ‚Äì died 1827), Antoine (born 1827 ‚Äì died 1827), Hedwige (born 1830 ‚Äì died 1831), and Marie Hedwige (born 1832 ‚Äì died 1836).Gr√©goire (2007), pp.17‚Äì27. In 1822, seeking more land in order to provide for their children's inheritance, the Jett√© family sold their farm under a staggered payment arrangement whereby they would not have the full payment for three years. While waiting for the payments to come through, the Jett√©s lived in Vercheres, either in rented property or residing with relatives. Cadron-Jett√©, Jean-Marie and their children were accompanied in the move by Rosalie's parents and Rosalie's sister Sophie.Gr√©goire (2007), p.20. In 1823 they moved again to Saint Hyacinthe and in 1824 they bought land there from a Charles Jarret. However, they later discovered the seller did not own the relevant land, leading in late 1826 or early 1827 to the repossession of the majority of the Jett√© family's property.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.21‚Äì22.Pinto (2003), p.67. Following this setback the family moved to Montreal, took residence in the borough of Saint-Laurent, and joined the congregation of Saint-Jacques Cathedral.Gr√©goire (2007), p.23. Widowhood On June 14, 1832, Cadron- Jett√©'s husband Jean-Marie died of cholera, one of many victims of that year's cholera epidemic, leaving Cadron-Jett√© widowed. Cadron-Jett√© responded to her husband's death by vowing to be in mourning, or wear black, for the remainder of her life.Gr√©goire (2007), p.28. At that time, Cadron-Jett√©'s eldest two sons, Jean-Marie and Pierre (20 and 17 years old, respectively), were employed as shoemakers, and the eldest daughter, Rose (19) was engaged (and was married in July 1833), while Cadron-Jett√©'s other four surviving children still required Cadron-Jett√©'s care, as did Cadron-Jett√©'s elderly mother.Gr√©goire (2007), p.27. It was not until 1838, following the death of Cadron-Jett√©'s mother and the maturity or death of her remaining children, that she found herself with time free to devote to charitable activities. Hospice de Sainte-P√©lagie Bishop Ignace Bourget (1799 -1885), spiritual director of Rosalie Cadron-Jett√© and the Hospice de Sainte-P√©lagie. Several sources describe an incident which purportedly had an influence on Cadron-Jett√©'s future career. Between 1830 and 1832, while living in Montreal, Cadron-Jett√© was visited at her house in the middle of the night by a prostitute who was seeking asylum from two sailors with intentions of violence. Cadron-Jett√© hid the woman for the night in her cellar, fed her, and counselled her to change her way of life. Subsequently Cadron-Jett√© received a letter from the woman informing her the woman had emigrated to the United States and made positive changes to her life, including marriage.Gr√©goire (2007), p.26. In any case, during her time in Montreal, Cadron-Jett√© made the acquaintance of Ignace Bourget, Bishop of the Diocese of Montreal. She met Bourget through her attendance at Saint Jacques Cathedral, where he became her spiritual director. Cadron-Jett√© joined his Archiconfr√©rie du Tr√®s Saint et Immacul√© Coeur de Marie, a group formed by Bourget to pray for the conversion of sinners.Gr√©goire (2007), p.32. Beginning in 1840, Bourget began to call upon Cadron-Jett√© to find crisis accommodation for unwed mothers who had approached him for confession and help. This accommodation was to be secret, as unwed mothers carried a significant social stigma at the time and were often the targets of hostility, and it was to be \\"with a kind and prayerful woman\\".Gr√©goire (2007), p.35. Cadron-Jett√© undertook this work, and between 1840 and 1845 helped around 25 women during their pregnancy, childbirth, and recovery. She would often place the women with her (now-independent) children,Gr√©goire (2007), p.36. and sometimes offered the women accommodation in her own home. After the birth of each child, Cadron-Jett√© would take the newborn to be baptised at Montreal's Notre Dame church, and stand as godmother for the child. In 1845, in response to growing demand brought about by Montreal's burgeoning population, Bourget began an organised project to assist unwed mothers in need of crisis accommodation and medical care. Although the Grey Nuns had been doing work in this area since 1754, their efforts were limited to the care of illegitimate newborns, and no services existed to aid the unwed mothers themselves.Gr√©goire (2007), p.34. In addition, the work of the Grey Nuns did not address the rate of abortions and infanticides among unwed mothers, which was of concern to Bourget due to Roman Catholic Church prohibitions on these activities. Therefore, rather than partnering with an existing religious community for this project, Bourget hoped to create a new one \\"free of traditions or previous hampering ties\\", and asked Rosalie Cadron- Jett√© to take a leading role. Cadron-Jett√© agreed, and on May 1, 1845 she founded the Hospice Sainte-P√©lagie (also known as the Maternit√© de Sainte- P√©lagie), operating out of the attic of a house on Saint-Simon Street, Montreal, which her son Pierre had leased from a widow named Aurelie Vin√©t.Gr√©goire (2007), p.38.Pinto (2003), p.68. The hospice derived its name from Saint Pelagia, a 5th-century reformed courtesan who chose to martyr herself rather than be raped by soldiers, to whom the Hospice was blessed and dedicated by Bishop Bourget shortly after its inception.Gr√©goire (2007), p.39. Early on, conditions in the hospice were rudimentary, consisting only of a table, some chairs, a stove, and a few beds for the mothers (called \\"penitents\\"), with Cadron-Jett√© herself sleeping on the floor. The attic could only be reached by a ladder on the exterior of the house and was not insulated.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.39‚Äì40. For this reason, Cadron-Jett√©'s new occupation was unpopular with her (now mature) children, who objected to the conditions of dire poverty in the Hospice and attempted to dissuade her from her new calling, on one occasion going so far as to begin moving her belongings out of the Hospice. Despite this, Cadron-Jett√© persevered, expanding the Hospice's operations to provide accommodation for up to seven or eight women at a time,O'Malley (2004), p.143. and, from July 1845, taking on an additional caregiver. This caregiver was Sophie Raymond n√©e Desmarets, herself a widow, who in addition to helping with the mothers, undertook fundraising activities on behalf of the hospice.Gr√©goire (2007), p.40. Through the combined efforts of Raymond and Bourget, the Hospice attracted the attentions of Antoine-Olivier Berthelet, a wealthy philanthropist, who provided money, food and firewood, and later contributed to the building of facilities for the Misericordia Sisters on Dorchester Boulevard. The house on Wolfe Street occupied by the Hospice de Sainte-P√©lagie from May 1846 to April 1847. On May 4, 1846, the hospice moved to an address on Wolfe Street in Faubourg Quebec owned by Jean-Baptiste Bourgault.Gr√©goire (2007), p.43. The new premises consisted of two storeys plus an attic, with the Hospice occupying one side of the house and the owner occupying the other.Gr√©goire (2007), p.43. \\"[They] settle into a bigger and more practical house ‚Äì a two- storey wooden structure, including an attic ‚Äì situated on Wolfe Stree in Faubourg Quebec. The other side of the house is occupied by the owner, Jean- Baptiste Bourgault.\\" The expanded space provided room for a small chapel featuring Stations of the Cross, where Mass was held twice weekly. It also allowed for the addition of three extra staff at the Hospice, including a Mrs Montrait, a midwife. During the Hospice's second year of operation it was host to 33 pregnant women and saw the birth of 25 infants. On July 26, 1846, Bishop Bourget unilaterally opened the noviciate of the Saint-P√©lagie Community, and placed the assembled female staff of the Hospice as novices within that program. This effectively established the Hospice de Saint-P√©lagie as a religious community, of which Bourget proclaimed Sophie Raymond to be the superior. It also allowed for women to join the community as postulants, with the aim of eventually taking religious vows. Bourget designated himself spiritual and canonical director of the novitiate, and delegated a priest, the Abb√© Antoine Rey, to be Director of the Hospice.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.45‚Äì46. Later that year at the direction of Coadjutor Bishop Jean-Charles Prince (later Bishop of Saint-Hyacinth) the Wolfe Street premises were expanded through the acquisition of the first floor adjacent to the hospice.Gr√©goire (2007), p.46. On September 17, 1846, Josephite Malo-Galipeau joined the community, bringing with her a large endowment of funds left to her by her late husband, which substantially enriched the community.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.46‚Äì47. Despite these additional funds the women of the Hospice were still forced to do odd jobs outside the hospice to make ends meet. Cadron-Jett√© during this time undertook occasional work as a shoemaker.Gr√©goire (2007), p.48. Elections were held within the community on November 6, 1846, with the result of Cadron-Jett√© being appointed as the new superior for a period of one year, with Malo-Galipeau named as her assistant. From December 1, 1846, the women of the community began wearing a religious habit at the direction of Bishop Prince.Gr√©goire (2007), p.47. In early 1847, Jean-Baptiste Bourgault, owner of the Wolfe Street premises, notified Cadron-Jett√© and the Hospice that he was evicting them, citing concern for his reputation. After exhaustive enquiries, a new premises was located on the corner of Sainte-Catherine and Saint-Andr√© streets, provided by John Donegani, a Montreal businessman, at a rent of 60 dollars a year. On April 26, 1847, the Hospice moved to the new site.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.48‚Äì49. A typhus epidemic swept Montreal in late 1847 and Montreal's religious communities, including Cadron-Jett√© and the staff of the hospice, were called upon by Bishop Bourget to assist in combating it. The hospice's chaplain and director, Antoine Rey, and its midwife, Madame Montrait, were among the nine priests and 13 Religious Sisters of Montreal who were killed by the disease. One of the hospice's penitents also died due to the disease.Gr√©goire (2007), p.50-51. Bishop Bourget subsequently named Father Venant Pilon as Rey's replacement as Director of the Hospice.Gr√©goire (2007), p.51.  Sisters of Misericorde  On January 16, 1848, at the age of 53, Cadron-Jett√© took Religious vows, along with seven other women who had worked with her at the Hospice. Those in attendance as observers at the profession ceremony included Bishop Ignace Bourget, and √âmilie Gamelin, under whose leadership the Sisters of Providence had been founded five years previously.Gr√©goire (2007), p.52. Along with her vows Cadron-Jett√© took the religious name Soeur de la Nativit√© (Sister Nativity), a reference to the role of the Virgin Mary in the birthing of Christ.O'Malley (2004), p.144. Together, the eight women of the Hospice formed the Institute of the Misericordia Sisters. Bourget petitioned the Church of Montreal to recognise the Institute and that recognition was granted. The institute received the ecclesiastical mandate to \\"live the mercy of Jesus the Saviour with girls and women in a situation of maternity out of wedlock and their children, and with the mothers of families who are having a difficult time with their maternity\\". The Institute was the first religious community in Canada to receive such a mission. The vows of the Misericordia Sisters were the traditional vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, together with a fourth vow, being that of \\"assisting in their labour fallen girls and women\\", with a consequence to \\"form a corps of midwives\\". On January 17, 1848, elections were held to determine leadership of the new community, and at the first election Josephite Malo-Galipeau (now Sister Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal) was appointed mother superior, and Cadron-Jett√© made councillor, with responsibility for the infirmary.Gr√©goire (2007), p.54. This position left Cadron-Jett√© free to undertake care for the ill and disadvantaged, including home visits and visits to prisons. Sources, including Gr√©goire's 2007 book Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©. A Story of Courage and Compassion, suggest Cadron-Jett√© may have been offered the position of mother superior, but declined it. Midwifery certificate of Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©, issued 1849. Beginning January 17, 1848, the eight founders of the Misericorde Sisters, including Cadron-Jett√©, commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eug√®ne-Hercule Trudele, a young obstetrician. The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before two members of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery.Bates et al (2005), p.69. It is most likely during this period or the years immediately following that Cadron-Jett√© learned to read and write.Gr√©goire (2007), p.55. In 1849 Malo-Galipeau was again elected Mother Superior with Cadron-Jett√© being given the position of assistant. Around this time the relationship between the two women became strained. Despite the election result Malo-Galipeau did not bestow formal titles on Cadron-Jett√© and is recorded as referring to Cadron- Jett√© disrespectfully as \\"Nativity\\" (a short form of her religious name) and on at least one occasion \\"fool\\".Gr√©goire (2007), p.58. Malo-Galipeau on several occasions during this period reprimanded Cadron-Jett√© for decisions Cadron-Jett√© had made in discharge of her formal responsibilities, and imposed punishments, including barring Cadron-Jett√© from communion.Gr√©goire (2007), p.59. The 1849 election was the last election to be held by the community until late 1858.Gr√©goire (2007), p.70. The Misericorde Sisters were not well liked by the Montreal community. Throughout the early years of the Hospice de Sainte-P√©lagie and the Institute, the locations in which Jett√© and the Sisters worked were kept secret, in order to protect the single mothers from public hostility towards prostitutes and unwed mothers. On some occasions when the Sisters brought newborns to church for baptism, garbage was thrown at them. People in prayer were reported to leave when the Sisters would enter the church.Poling (2007), p.222. The Sisters faced controversy not only from public opinion, but also within the medical profession. Initially the response of Montreal doctors was positive, and in 1850 the College of Physicians petitioned Bishop Bourget for permission to send students to the Hospice de Sainte-P√©lagie for training, which Bourget granted over the objections of the Sisters.Gr√©goire (2007), p.56. However, friction arose between the Sisters and the students; the Sisters did not want the students present (a position shared by many of the unwed mothers), while the students were often contemptuous, rude, or dismissive towards their patients. Combined with the competency of the Misericorde Sisters, and their non-profit mandate, this friction bloomed into hostility between the Sisters and Montreal physicians, who came to see the midwives as a professional threat. On May 13, 1851, Antoine-Olivier Berthelet purchased land on the corner of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint-Andr√© Street (in Montreal) for use by the Misericorde Sisters, and in December 1851, following renovations to the two pre-existing structures on the land, the Sisters moved to the new address.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.61‚Äì62. In 1853 work began on a Mother House (or convent) for the Institute. The Motherhouse was planned to be a multistory building, built of grey stone, financed by borrowed money. Plans for the motherhouse had been drawn up in 1852 but the Montreal fires of July 8, 1852, which destroyed around 11,000 homes along with the Saint-Jacques Cathedral, had the result of delaying construction projects throughout the city.Gr√©goire (2007), p.63. In 1853, Bourget met with the Sisters and questioned whether their fourth vow (that of assisting in labour) should be abandoned, with the consequence of the medical work of midwifery being done by physicians and lay midwives. Bourget's concerns stemmed both from pressure and criticism from the Montreal medical community, and from a desire to expand the membership of the Sisters, as he feared potential candidates would be deterred by the necessity of learning and practicing the craft of midwifery.Gr√©goire (2007), p.65. Cadron-Jett√© took the firm position that the vow should be retained, citing the general contempt held by physicians for the Sisters and their patients, the incompetence of the student doctors who were the Sisters' primary competition, and the expressed preference of her patients to deal with the Sisters rather than doctors. Bourget retreated in the face of Cadron- Jett√©'s opposition and the matter was not raised again for some years.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.65‚Äì66.Despite the opposition of Cadron-Jett√© and Malo-Galipeau (who remained mother superior until 1863 and was thereafter assistant), in 1865 the Sisters were forced by their church superiors in the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life to revise their constitution and abandon the fourth vow, on the grounds that it was unbecoming to their virtue. From that point on, the Sisters were required to use the services of physicians and lay midwives, including the lay order known as the Daughters of St Thais (later the St Margaret's Daughters). In 1856 the City of Montreal donated a building located across the street from the convent for the use of the Misericordia Sisters. Called \\"Corporation House\\" it was put to use as a residence for the single mothers cared for by the Institute, with the mothers being charged rent by the Sisters while they stayed there.Gr√©goire (2007), p.69. In late 1858 new elections were held by the Sisters, with Malo- Galipeau reappointed as mother superior and Cadron-Jett√© given the position of Councillor. Around this time of these elections Bishop Bourget also gave the Sisters permission to baptise children at the Hospice, rather than take them to Notre Dame Cathedral for baptism, which was significant as by 1858 the Sisters were supervising around 137 births per year, each requiring a trip to the Cathedral for baptism.Gr√©goire (2007), p.71. By 1858, Malo-Galipeau had become widely recognised as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, partly due to her role as Mother Superior and partly due to the endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jett√© should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jett√© the title of Mother (such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or M√®re de la Nativit√©) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.72‚Äì74. For some years, beginning prior to 1853, the Institute had been taking in what were called \\"madeleines\\" or \\"magdalens\\",Gr√©goire (2007), pp.63‚Äì65. and in 1859 this practice was formally recognised with the Magdalens made a secondary order of the Misericordia Sisters. The practice of taking in Magdalens followed a tradition originating in Europe, where religious orders would take in \\"repentants\\" or \\"penitents\\" and place them under the protection of Mary Magdalene, a famous reformed sinner of Roman Catholic tradition, and from whom they took the name. In the case of the Misericordia Sisters, Magdalens were recruited from those unwed mothers who did not wish to leave the care of the sisters even after recovering from giving birth. They were allowed to take religious vows and live within the Misericordia Sisters community, obeying particular rules of dedication to contemplation. During the time the program lasted, about 1% to 1.5% of mothers helped by the Institute stayed on as Magdalens.Gr√©goire (2007), p.64.  Later life and death  By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©'s health was worsening significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jett√©'s family suggests that Cadron-Jett√© had become ill when she was 36 years old and never fully recovered.Gr√©goire (2007), p.76. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known at the time as dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at the time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jett√© by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while standing and at rest, and swollen legs displaying open sores.Gr√©goire (2007), p.77. In any case, from around 1859, due to declining health, Cadron-Jett√© ceased her work as a midwife, and from 1862 stopped making house visits to care for the ill. As the convent did not yet have an infirmary, she spent most of her days during this time in the convent's dormitory, until 1861, when at Bishop Bourget's request a private room was prepared for Cadron-Jett√© by Malo-Galipeau.Gr√©goire (2007), pp.77‚Äì78. In 1863, Cadron-Jett√©, by then bedridden, was moved to a room adjoining the convent's newly constructed chapel.Gr√©goire (2007), p.80. Advised of her failing health, Bishop Ignace Bourget visited Cadron-Jett√© on April 4, 1864, and administered to her the last rites. Rosalie Cadron-Jett√© died shortly thereafter, during the early hours of April 5. Her death was witnessed by Sister Marie-des-Saints-Anges, who said this of the occasion: \\"I witnessed her blessed death. I was sitting vigil with our good sister Sainte-B√©atrix. Around 2 a.m. she made the sign of the cross and asked us to recite the Litanies of the Virgin Mary; then she arranged herself as if to prepare for sleep, then in a high pitched voice she said: O my Jesus! Then I noticed she was getting weaker; we brought the light closer to her and realized she had already passed over to a better life.\\"Gr√©goire (2007), p.85. Several unexplained incidents are associated with Cadron-Jett√©'s death. According to H√©l√®ne Gr√©goire's 2007 book Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©. A Story of Courage and Compassion, at the moment of Cadron-Jett√©'s death an \\"unknown, elderly sister\\" holding a lantern was observed by women in the Magdalens' dormitory. The \\"elderly sister\\" is recorded as addressing one of the Magdalens who was ill and telling her that \\"if she is very brave and prays with confidence, she will be healed\\". The unknown sister then left the dormitory.Gr√©goire (2007), p.86. Gr√©goire also claims that the other Sisters were mysteriously awakened during the night of Cadron-Jett√©'s death, and that following Cadron-Jett√©'s death the wounds on Cadron-Jett√©'s legs were observed to be inexplicably healed over. A funeral was held for Cadron-Jett√© on April 8, 1864 at the chapel of the Misericordia Sisters, with Bishop Bourget and several dignitaries of the Church of Montreal in attendance. At the time of her death, the Institute of Misericordia Sisters comprised 33 professed religious, 11 novices and postulants, and 25 magdalens and other women.  Cause for canonization  In 1879, Ignace Bourget suggested to Sister St-Th√©r√®se de J√©sus (then mother superior of the Misericordia Sisters) that she gather testimonials from Cadron-Jett√©'s contemporaries for use in a possible future canonization cause.Gr√©goire (2007), p.11. In 1881, in a letter to the Misericordia community, he said, \\"Your Mother of the Nativity must be canonized; you must have enough faith and confidence in her protection to obtain miracles from her, then the Church will make a formal declaration.\\"Bessette (2008), p.13. In 1989, Cardinal Paul Gr√©goire (then Archbishop of Montr√©al), signed a degree opening a canonical inquiry into Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©, beginning a process within the Roman Catholic Church which as of 2011 is still ongoing and which may eventually result in the elevation of Cadron-Jett√© to sainthood. The process is overseen by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (the CCS) in Rome. On November 6, 1990, the Diocesan Tribunal tasked with investigation of Cadron-Jett√©'s cause was officially opened, granting to Cadron-Jett√© the title of \\"Servant of God\\", the first of four steps which may culminate in canonization. An inquiry was then made into whether Cadron-Jett√© was the object of any public cult. Diocesan Acts of the Trial were drawn up for scrutiny by the under-secretary of the CCS, and on January 29, 1993 a decree was signed sanctioning those Acts by Jean-Claude Turcotte, Archbishop of Montr√©al, and read by Michel Parent, chancellor of the Montr√©al diocese. Following the decree, a positio was drafted in Montr√©al by Sister Gis√®le Boucher for presentation in Rome, presenting the evidence collected during the diocesan enquiry and creating a foundation for further enquiry into the elevation of Cadron-Jett√©. The 856-page positio was tabled at the CSS on July 1, 1994.Gr√©goire (2007), p.12.Boucher, Gis√®le (1994) Beatification and canonisation de la Servante de Dieu, Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©, en religion Mere de la Nativit√© In 2011, the positio was presented to a committee of expert theologians.  Legacy  As of 2010, the Misericordia Sisters are still operating, with a presence in several countries and on multiple continents. A number of buildings throughout North America are named after Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©, including: * Rosalie Manor in Milwaukee, established by the Misericordia Sisters in 1908. * Rosalie Hall in Toronto, a young parent resource centre. * Rosalie Hall in the Bronx, New York, a care and comfort centre for pregnant and parenting teens, originally part of the former Misericordia Hospital founded by the Sisters. * Villa Rosa in Winnipeg, a care centre for mothers and babies. Rosalie Cadron-Jett√©'s childhood home in Lavaltrie is today known as the Maison Rosalie-Cadron and since 2006 has been open to the public between the months of May and October.

Early life and education  Thomas Maitland Cleland was born August 18, 1880 in Brooklyn, New York. Cleland studied at the ArtistArtisan Institute in Chelsea, New York, but was otherwise self-taught. Career Cleland began his career as a book designer for the Caslon Press and created title pages for Merrymount Press. D. B. Updike of Merrymount Press was a mentor who encouraged him to strive for perfection with commissions and criticism. When the Caslon Press folded in 1900, Cleland acquired a small foot-powered press and some fonts and launched his own printing shop from a room he constructed in his father's basement. He managed to produce two small books along with small job printing projects. His work caught the notice of printing enthusiasts in Boston, who persuaded him to move his operation there and launch the Cornhill Press.Meggs, Philip B. \\"An Eminent Pre-Modernist: The Curious Case Of T.M.

In 1925, he created illustrations and typography for Wesvaco Paper Corporation's in-house magazine. In 1929, he was hired on as art director to design Fortune magazine by Henry Luce. The initial issue in February 1930 was hailed as a masterpiece of classical design and was pitched to Luce at the initial meeting. In 1937, he planned a typographical refresh of Newsweek. Later, he designed the newspaper PM. The design of the newspaper earned him the Ayer Award.Friedl, Ott, and Stein, p. 170. He worked on eight books for the Limited Editions Club of The Heritage Press, designing a variety of illustrations, typography, and complete books. He also consulted printers on ink printing.

Abrahams, a tobacconist, supplied the artists with wooden cigar-box lids for painting impressions. Many of the lids measured 9 by 5 inches, hence the name of the exhibition. The 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition was an art exhibition in Melbourne, Australia. It opened on 17 August 1889 at Buxton's Rooms on Swanston Street and featured 183 works, the majority of which were painted by Charles Conder, Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton of the Heidelberg School art movement, also known as Australian impressionism. The exhibition's name references the dimensions of most of the paintings--, the size of the cigar box lids upon which many of the works were painted--as well as the impressionist techniques employed by the artists. The majority of the 9 by 5s were painted over the autumn and winter of 1889, which is reflected in the tones and weather effects of many of the landscapes. The rural suburb of Heidelberg, where Streeton had established an artists' camp the previous year, is featured in many of the works. Melbourne's urban life and culture are also depicted, with landmarks such as Princess Theatre, the Old Treasury and the Burke and Wills statue making appearances, as well as the city's trams and games of Australian rules football. The exhibition created much lively commentary at the time and is now seen as a \\"celebrated event in Australian art history\\". 9 by 5s continue to appear on the market; in 2019, Roberts' She- Oak and Sunlight sold at Sotheby's for A$770,000.Important Australian Art: Tom Roberts, She-Oak and Sunlight, Sotheby's.

It is neutral Arabic name, given as first name by Arab and Muslim communities of all sects, as well as in the Arab Christian community, and in the Druze community. Within Islam Ri·∏çƒÅ is often found rather vaguely within the English translation of the Qur'an, and in the life accounts of Sufi saints such as RƒÅbi ªa al- ªAdawiyya al-Qaysiyya (Rabia al-Adawiyya). According to Annemarie Schimmel, author of Mystical Dimensions of Islam, \\"ri·∏çƒÅ is closely related to shukr, or gratitude\\", another virtue within Islam.Shimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam, 126. Other possible related virtues would be sabr, faqr, tawakkul, and zuhd; all coalescing to form \\"perfect sincerity\\" or ikhlas.

A great famine occurred in Basra. The sisters were separated, and Rabi'a fell into the hands of a wicked man who sold her for a few dirhams. That master ordered her to work long and hard. One day on the street, she fled from the indignity. She fell and broke her hand. She put her face on the ground and said,'I am a stranger without mother or father. I am captive and my hand is broken. None of this saddens me. All I need is for you to be pleased with me, to know whether you are pleased with me or not.' She heard a voice say, 'Do not be sad. Tomorrow a grandeur will be yours such that the closes of the heavenly company will take pride in you.'\\"Attar, \\"Memorial of the Friends of God,\\" in Early Islamic Mysticism, ed. and trans.

She has been beatified by the Catholic Church. Early life She was born Catherine de Simon de Longpr√© in the town of Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, then part of the ancient Province of Normandy in France. Raised primarily by her grandparents, as a child she showed a marked concern for the needs of the sick and the poor. In 1644 she entered the monastery of the Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus in Bayeux, which operated the H√¥tel-Dieu of the city. She was received into the novitiate of the Order on 24 October of that year, at which point she was given the religious name by which she is now known. New France In the year 1648 she was among those of the Order who volunteered to respond to the appeal for help to help the canonesses in Quebec who had founded the H√¥tel-Dieu there for the needs of the colony. On 31 May, then aged 16, Mother Catherine, set sail for the colony. While en route, she fell victim to the plague, from which she was cured in what seemed a miraculous way, which she attributed to the protection of Blessed Mother, through the means of a statue of her which she had brought with her from France and which is still revered as miraculous. She arrived in the port of Quebec on 19 August. After Mother Catherine's arrival, she began the task of nursing the sick in the hospital of the monastery, attending to both the patients' spiritual as well as their physical needs. She learned the languages of the First Peoples of the region to serve them better. She would work to bring the patients closer to God. The Superior of the hospital, Mother St. Bonaventure, later testified that she and the other canonesses could tell that Catherine would spend long periods in prayer and undertook severe mortifications of her body in support of her spiritual mission, to the point of endangering her own health. At the same time as she also cared for the patients in these different ways, Mother Catherine spent nine years as treasurer of the hospital. Additionally, she was entrusted with the task of forming new candidates to the community as Novice Mistress. Yet, despite this harsh way of life, both her Superior and the famed Ursuline of Quebec, the Blessed Marie of the Incarnation, attested to the sweetness of disposition Mother Catherine continually exhibited in dealing with others throughout her life, and for which she was known throughout the colony. La vie de la mere Catherine de Saint Augustin by Paul Ragueneau, 1671 Mother Catherine of St. Augustine died in 1668 at hospital she had helped to run, aged 36. She was widely held by the people of New France to have been a saint. Veneration Due to her self-sacrifice for both the European settlers of the colony and for the native inhabitants, Mother Catherine came to be honoured as one of the six founders of the Catholic Church in Canada, representing the contributions of the Augustinian canonesses. The cause for her canonization was presented to the Holy See in Vatican City. Mother Catherine was declared to have lived a life of extraordinary virtue on 9 March 1984 by Pope John Paul II. Declaring that she offered her life for the establishment of the Catholic faith in Canada, this same pope, on 23 April 1989, beatified her. The Blessed Catherine's feast day is celebrated in Quebec on 8 May. Her remains are preserved for veneration at the Centre Catherine-de- Saint-Augustin, adjacent to the H√¥tel-Dieu.

It was first performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon on 4 November 1992. The play takes place between the Summer of 1592 and Spring 1593. It concerns the life of Christopher Marlowe and the mystery surrounding his untimely death during a brawl in Deptford, set against a backdrop of a politically and religiously divided England where the state and its spies watch those who may be accused of sedition, treason and blasphemy. Characters *Christopher Marlowe *Thomas Walsingham *Audrey Walsingham *Tom Stone (William Shakespeare) *Thomas Kyd *Nicholas Skeres *Ingram Frizer *Walter Raleigh *Rosalinda Benotti *Robert Poley *Officer of the Watch Plot=Act One In Scadbury Park, the home of Thomas Walsingham, Marlowe engages in a mock incantation to his personal deity Dog. He discusses his religious scepticism with Walsingham and Kyd. They introduce an actor called Tom Stone who will be performing for them in tandem with Rosalinda, a mixed-race Italian actress who is in love with Marlowe. Marlowe and Rosalinda are suspicious of Stone, who asks a lot of questions. Rosalinda is convinced she has seen him before. Walter Raleigh arrives to witness the performance. They discuss art, politics and religion while watching Stone and Rosalinda act in a risqu√© satire written by Marlowe. Afterwards Stone queries Kyd about the ‚Äòschool of night‚Äô, an allegedly atheistic and subversive secret society to which Raleigh, Walsingham and Marlowe belonged. Kyd tells Stone that it was supposed to have promoted republicanism. He also tells him about Marlowe's early career as a spy. Marlowe and Rosalinda reappear and confront Stone. They have discovered that his real name is Shakespeare, author of the Henry VI plays. He explains that he is using a stage name, but they are unconvinced. Shakespeare tells Marlowe he is working on a poem, Venus and Adonis. Marlowe is surprised by the similarity to his own new project Hero and Leander. Kyd decides to leave Scadbury. A day later: Shakespeare has been in bed with Rosalinda. Marlowe enters and reads some lines from Shakespeare‚Äôs new poem. He is disturbed by its power. He and Shakespeare discuss literature. Walsingham informs Marlowe that his indiscreet declarations of heretical opinions can get them all in trouble. Raleigh has already been arrested on the unrelated charge of marrying illegally, but they are all coming under suspicion. In London Skeres and Poley burst into Kyd‚Äôs rooms and arrest him, looking for documents believed to be held by Marlowe on the 'school of night'. Act Two A commedia dell'arte performance is held at Scadbury. Shakespeare argues that opinion gets in the way of art. Marlowe is disconcerted by Shakespeare's views. Horsemen arrive to arrest Marlowe. In London, Marlowe is visited in prison by Raleigh who tells him he has been denounced as a blasphemer. Raleigh says he can free Marlowe, but he wants to be sure that Marlowe has no incriminating records of the meetings of the school of night. Marlowe insists there are none. He is freed. In the Rose theatre Shakespeare reads one of the Dark Lady sonnets he has written about Rosalinda. They are hiding there with Marlowe. Skeres and Poley arrive. Shakespeare attempts to fight them, but Marlowe assures him they are friends. They tell Marlowe that they have a plan to get him away. They will meet at Deptford, where they will have a body resembling Marlowe. They will claim he drowned in the river, while Marlowe escapes overseas. Marlowe tells Rosalinda that he has hidden the records of the school of night at Scadbury. She is to get them and then meet him in Venice. Shakespeare is suspicious of the escape plan, and suggests that Marlowe travel by another route. However, he agrees to allow Marlowe's 'posthumous' works to be published in his name. At Deptford, Marlowe, Frizer, Poley and Skeres discover that the man whose body they have been given died from a stab wound. They decide to improvise a new plan according to which Marlowe will be killed in a fight. Frizer will be the killer and the others will say he acted in self-defence. Marlowe is now very suspicious. He abuses Frizer and threatens him with a knife. He forces Skeres to swear that there is no plan to kill him. Frizer, infuriated, twists Marlowe's arm back, stabbing him with his own knife. Skeres and Poley are horrified. Marlowe dies. Shakespeare and Rosalinda visit Marlowe's grave in Deptford. Rosalinda is still convinced that all went as planned and she will meet Marlowe in Venice. Shakespeare says she must prepare herself for the possibility that Marlowe is dead. Commentary In Shakespeare Survey, Jill L. Levinson, says that Whelan creates an \\"elusive Shakespeare, gifted and influential\\" and that the play weaves together references to \\"more than half a dozen scripts from Henry VI to Othello.\\"Peter Holland, Shakespeare Survey: Volume 58, Writing about Shakespeare, p.5. The Hollywood Reporter complained that the play was far too heavy on exposition, but that \\"Whelan does capture the spasms of desperation which seize the seeming cabal of doomed and threatened dramatists as they careen through history's obscure plots and even more obscure subplots. If Whelan's version of Marlowe were intended to be a James Bond of the late 16th century, however, it misses the mark by a wide margin.\\"Laurence Vittes, \\"Theater Review: The School of Night: Bottom Line: So Christopher Marlowe was a spy who didn't write Shakespeare after all. So who cares?\\", The Hollywood Reporter, 10 November 2008. Ian Shuttleworth for City Limits also complained about the expositions: \\"Half the evening seems given over to brute exposition, with characters informing each other of developments offstage, the byzantine intrigues of court or questions of religion and succession. It felt written for the specific press-night milieu of Stratford habitu√©s.\\" Ian Shuttleworth, City Limits, November 1992.

Until 1892, silver was the metal on which Indian currency and coinage had largely been based. In 1892, the Government of India announced its intent to \\"close Indian mints to silver\\" and, in 1893, it brought this policy into force. The committee recommended that the official Indian rupee be based on the gold standard and the official exchange rate of the rupee be established at 15 rupees per British sovereign, or 1 shilling and 4 pence per rupee. The British Imperial Government accepted the recommendations of the commission in July 1899. The action of the government in abandoning silver coinage was driven by the relative decline of the value of silver against gold, which had led to an accompanying decline of the rupee against gold and gold-based currencies (such as the British sovereign). India had been importing about a quarter of the annual global production of silver, in part to meet its currency issuing requirements. Some commentators noted that silver was gradually being globally discarded as a basis of currency, with only three main remaining supporters: Mexico (a major producer of silver), the United States, and India. With India's move to the gold standard, the silver standard lost a significant supporter. Miscellaneous The committee was chaired by Sir Henry Fowler (later Viscount Fowler), and was often referred to as the Fowler Committee. Its final recommendation was also referred to as the Fowler Report.

Several years afterward he became partner in the concern, and from 1842 until 1853 he was engaged in the book-auction business. In 1854 Keese received the appointment of appraiser of books in the New York Custom House, which office he filled until his death. While in office, he devoted many evenings to his former vocation of book auctioneer. During his career, Keese became widely known among literary men and booksellers as a humorous off-hand speaker, editor, and wit.

Mystical Dimensions of Islam. USA: University of North Carolina, 1975. p 142, 267 Sufi view For those of the Sufi tradition, wuj≈´d has more to do with the finding of God than the existence of God. Although wuj≈´d is commonly translated as \\"existence\\", its original meaning is the \\"being found\\". This \\"being found\\" is sometimes described as the final stage of fanaa in which one is immersed in the existence or finding of God while all else is annihilated. \\"For a Sufi, beyond the realization of the annihilation of the state of nonexistence, there is nothing except existence.

Relation to Wajd Wajd can be translated to mean 'ecstasy'. Wujud (which is described as ecstatic existentiality in this instance) is said to occur only after one goes beyond wajd. In other words, ecstasy does not lead to anything other than Being. Wajd and Wujud can be better understood in terms of tawhid as well. Tawhid (or doctrine of Oneness of God) is described as a beginning and wujud as an end, with wajd being an intermediary between the two. Abu 'Ali ad-Daqqaq further explains: \\"Tawhƒ´d entails the encompassing of the servant. Ecstasy (wajd) entails the immersion of the servant.

Mahwah, NJ: Paulist, 1996. p 113, 121, 131, 254 The Sufis believe that anyone who experiences wajd brings back some residual knowledge from the object of his finding (wujud). Also, when one gains knowledge from experience, one must attempt to find a contraction to balance it. If one fails to do so, one remains at a lower level of knowledge.Singh, David E. \\"The Possibility of Having Knowledge of Al-wuj≈´d Al-mahd 'sheer Being' According to Ibn 'Arabƒ´ S KitƒÅb Al-jalƒÅl Wa-al-jamƒÅl.\\" Islam & Christian-Muslim Relations 10.3 (1999): 295.

Through being made present I taste the flavor of my existence.‚Äù He also states ‚ÄúThe wujud (finding, experience, ecstasy, existence) of the real occurs though the loss of your self‚Äù The self is another major part of existence in Islamic philosophy. Many claim that the existence of the self is proof for the existence of the Other. This 'Other' is said to be the only Reality, meaning that ‚Äúwhatever 'is' other than the Other is nonexistent.‚Äù As 'Abd al-Karƒ´m ibn HawƒÅzin al-Qushayrƒ´ puts it: ‚ÄúThe first passing away is the passing away of the self and its attributes to endure through the attributes of the real. Then there is the passing away from the attributes of the real through witnessing of the real. Then there is a person's passing away from witnessing his own passing away through his perishing in the ecstatic existentiality (wujud) of the real‚Äù There is also the view that there are two kinds of Being, corporeal and spiritual.

Harrison Public Library, the first library in Raleigh to serve African Americans. Her greatest achievement was developing, maintaining, and increasing public library service to the African American people of Raleigh and Wake County, North Carolina while striving to achieve equal library service for the entire community. Personal life Mollie Huston Lee was born in Columbus, Ohio on January 18, 1907 to Corrina Smith Huston and Rolla Solomon Huston, a private business owner and politician. As the only child of \\"learned parents,\\" there were always books around the family home and growing up, Lee developed an interest in public affairs.Hanchar, Jessica. Mrs. Lee to retire: Librarian, library grew together. The Raleigh Times. 1 June 1972. She married Dr. James S. Lee in 1935 and had one son, James S. Lee Jr. Education and early career While attending Howard University, Lee worked as a student library assistant under the direction of A.C. Williams, the man she described as the first black librarian to ever receive a library degree in this country. Lee acknowledged A.C. Williams as the inspiration for her future efforts as a pioneering librarian. After earning an A.B. from Howard University, Lee received a scholarship to attend library school at Columbia University. Upon earning a bachelor of library science from Columbia University, Lee returned to North Carolina in 1930 and began working as a librarian at Shaw University. During her five-year employment at the Shaw University Library, Lee recognized the need among blacks in the surrounding community for a special African- American literature collection. She recognized that this need could be met through the services of a public library. Library leader and pioneer In 1905 public library service was extended to blacks in Charlotte, North Carolina but Raleigh had to wait another thirty years. By 1935 there were only twelve black public libraries in North Carolina, however little action was taken in most areas of North Carolina to open libraries to blacks. Mollie Huston Lee was an advocate for bringing a library that would serve African Americans to Raleigh. Lee and a group of community members met in 1935 with the white mayor, George A. Isley, to discuss the creation of a public library that would serve blacks. Fulfilling a goal to establish a black literary collection at a library, the Richard B. Harrison Public Library opened on November 12, 1935. Lee valued community outreach and frequently brought the library to patrons when they were unable to visit the library themselves. Her actions encouraged community members to use the library and its resources. Despite trying economic conditions, the library's resources continued to expand due to Lee's efforts.Speller, Benjamin F. 1996. \\"Mollie Huston Lee.\\" Notable American Women, Volume 2. Detroit, MI: Gale Research Inc. In addition to establishing a library and services for African Americans in Raleigh, Lee also assisted in the training of future librarians. Library science students from Atlanta University, North Carolina Central University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill learned from firsthand experiences at the Harrison Library under the direction of Mollie Huston Lee. She served as the supervisor of Negro School Libraries in North Carolina from 1946 to 1953. Lee was known as a \\"librarian's librarian.\\"Moore, Ray Nichols. 1975. Mollie Huston Lee: A Profile. Wilson Library Bulletin. 49(6):432-439. Reflecting on her career as a librarian, Lee expressed, \\"I don't know of anything else that can help anyone grow more than working in a library.\\" Mollie Huston Lee told a radio audience in 1951, \\"a public library is the recorded memory of mankind, serving the community. Its function is to make available to all, information and thought in all fields of human knowledge and experience and to help each person, whatever his interest may be, to find and use the books and other library facilities and material which best serve his needs.\\"Valentine, Patrick. 1998. Mollie Huston Lee: Founder of Raleigh's Public Black Library. North Carolina Libraries. 56(1):23-26. During her thirty-seven year career at the Harrison Library, she saw the library evolve from a tiny, one-room storefront library on Hargett Street to a $300,000 structure on New Bern Avenue. She retired from a forty-two year library career on June 30, 1972 to \\"have fun and do some of the things I have not had time for.\\" Mollie Huston Lee Collection of Black Literature Lee's dedication to the African American populations in Raleigh, Wake County, and North Carolina are best evident in the extensive collection of books and other resources by and about African Americans she established, making the Harrison Library groundbreaking. It was her hope and desire that the African American community would know and be proud of their African American heritage. Lee established this quality collection as a result of meticulous efforts to collect publications about African Americans. In an interview, Lee stated, \\"I felt there was a need to emphasize black books. Black collections were not popular then like they are today. I felt more people should know about black history, black authors, and the contributions of black people.\\" Commonly, publications about African Americans were only in print for two years, as a result, Lee attentively monitored publishers and vendors of African American books. She would even visit the University Place Book Shop in New York City to select and purchase rare items for the collection. This collection of over 5,000 volumes ranging from adult and children's fiction and nonfiction, serials, pamphlets, and vertical file materials grew gradually but slowly during the thirty-eight years Lee served as librarian at the Harrison Library. An annual appropriate from the State Library of North Carolina over the period of twelve years provided the greatest financial assistance for the collection. The collection now became accessible to the public libraries of North Carolina through the State Library's Interlibrary loan, thus recognizing the value of the collection. In 1972 the \\"Negro Collection\\" was renamed the Mollie Huston Lee Collection of Black Literature. Emphasis on community outreach and programming Mollie Huston Lee viewed the civic education of community members as essential and she created a well-defined philosophy of community affairs that is evident throughout her career. Lee stated: \\"If you're a public librarian, you have to be with the people to find out their wants and needs and supply them with the materials to give them the insight to a more wholesome life through reading materials. You can't just sit behind a desk and issue books.\\" Programming at the Harrison Library included lectures featuring black and white speakers, children's authors, and an expanded story time. An emphasis was placed on adult education, \\"[teaching] them how to live better, longer, fuller and more enjoyable lives.\\" Educational programs directed to residents of the rural Raleigh area provided instruction in the development of reading and writing skills. Discussion groups on relevant topics were also created for patrons of all ages with the idea of keeping community members informed and aware of current news issues. The Harrison Library was well known regionally and nationally for providing services and programs for the aged, blind, disadvantaged, and illiterate. Programming at the Harrison Library fulfilled a need within the community. Children were provided with educational and recreational tools to assist with their formation as good citizens and adults were provided with materials to aid with their wholesome and useful life within their community. Membership and honors The esteem to which Mollie Huston Lee was held is indicated by her selection as a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) library delegate and her appointment as a trustee of the State Library of North Carolina. Lee also was instrumental in the foundation of the North Carolina Negro Library Association (NCNLA) which dissolved once the American Library Association (ALA) and the North Carolina Library Association opened membership to African Americans. She was the second African American elected at-large to the ALA council, serving from 1950 to 1954 and in 1971 Lee represented ALA at the White House Conference on Aging. In 1971, Lee was the first African American woman elected \\"Tar Heel of the Week\\" as a result of her numerous professional and civic contributions to the state of North Carolina.

It was the first flagship product of Gametize (formerly Socialico), a Singapore-based startup founded by Keith Ng and Damon Widjaja.In Conversation with Keith Ng, co-founder of FAME & Socialico (Published August 2009) It was a simulated stock exchange and a prediction market web application with more than 100,000 registered users. FameLeague adds gaming mechanics to prediction speculations, a concept also known as gamification, though that term is not commonly used in 2009. FameLeague's technology enable users to speculate and purchase shares of predictions, with each potential outcome of a prediction being a stock. With each accurate prediction stock invested, users stand to earn points. Likewise, users also earn points when the popularity of a prediction increases. The reverse is also true; users will lose points for wrong predictions, or when a dip in popularity occurs for the user's chosen prediction. FameLeague mimics the behaviour of actual stock markets, but in a highly simplified form. History FameLeague was a simulated stock exchange and a prediction market web application integrated with popular social media website, Facebook. It was inaugurated as a beta release in April 2009, and went live on November 16, 2009. Prior to its revamp, it had more than 20,000 registered users.

In the FameLeague, the player and the members of his/her social network were listed as stocks that could be purchased by others as shares. Shares on popular media such as music, movies and celebrities could also be traded. Like the actual stock exchange, the market price of a stock was determined by the number of shares traded for that stock. On top of that, prediction stock ‚Äì or stock that specifies a possible outcome to an ongoing or future event ‚Äì could also be traded, and their market prices depended on the expected outcome. The objective of the game was to earn as much Silver - the main currency in FameLeague - as possible, by making accurate forecasts while purchasing prediction stocks, and through ability to anticipate which stocks would become more popular on FameLeague when purchasing stock on friends, celebrities or media. In May 2010, the management made a strategic decision to segment the broad-based game into individual products such as FameMark, a fantasy game for trading shares of people with a dating angle, and PremierX, a fantasy stock exchange for English Premier League. FameLeague was then developed into a generic technology engine that drives these segmented products upon customization. These three products (FameLeague, FameMark, PremierX) have been stalled in developments. In February 2012, the company has become a full-fledged cloud-based gamification platform, initially a side project code-named 'GameMaki' and later branded as Gametize. Along with this, the company also rebranded from 'Socialico' to 'Gametize'. Today, Gametize is a gamification company that uses game thinking and game psychology to help brands and organizations engage their target audience and motivate for target behaviors, such as in marketing, learning, and training. It engages and motivates behaviors with challenges such as quizzes, photo, QR code challenges.

He played professional football for the Butte, Montana football team in 1896 and 1897 and practiced law in Butte and Chicago from 1896 to 1953. Biography=Early years Dygert was born on November 25, 1870 and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He attended Ann Arbor High School where he played two years on the high school's football team, including one year as the team's captain. Michigan Dygert enrolled at the University of Michigan and played five years at the fullback and halfback positions for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1890 to 1894. As a freshman in 1890, Dygert played on the first racially integrated Michigan football team, a team that featured Dygert and George Jewett, both of whom grew up in Ann Arbor, playing in the same backfield. (After Jewett, another African-American did not play football at Michigan until Willis Ward did so in the 1930s.) The 1890 Michigan team photograph shows Dygert and Jewett seated next to each other. (Cropped image at right.) Dygert (lower left) with George Jewett (upper right) on the 1890 Michigan team In November 1891, after Dygert's second year playing for the Wolverines, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: > \\"Dygert, full-back, has received his football as well as his intellectual > education in Ann Arbor. He is short and thickset, having 158 pounds of > muscle attached to five feet seven and one-half inches of length. He tackles > low and hard and can be found at the bottom of almost every heap.\\" Dygert was elected as the team captain of the 1892 and 1893 Michigan football teams that compiled records of 7-5 and 7-3, respectively. He was also one of the leaders of the 1894 team that compiled a record of 9-1-1, outscoring opponents 244 to 84. Dygert authored an article on the 1894 season for The Michigan Alumnus in which he credited the team's manager Charles A. Baird, head coach William McCauley and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick for the team's success: > \\"The fall semester opened under the most favorable conditions for as fine an > eleven as Michigan has ever had.

Lack of money has been the cry hitherto.\\" Dygert received his bachelor's degree in 1893 and thereafter remained at the university for two more years as a law student. When he received his undergraduate degree in June 1893, the Detroit Free Press wrote: > \\"Another of the men who have proved themselves to be the strongest in the > public affairs of the graduating class is Mr. George B.

In March 1896, The Michigan Alumnus reported that he had been admitted to the bar at Butte, and had begun practice there. His law practice in Butte specialized in mining law. In addition to his law practice, Dygert also played professional football for a team in Butte that was sponsored by mine owners. He played halfback for the Butte team in 1896 and 1897. (\\"Near the beginning of the second half Dygert made a touchdown\\") The Los Angeles Times called the \\"Buttes\\" the best football team in the West in 1896, as they defeated the Denver Athletic Club 20-0 and the San Francisco Olympics 18-0. The Times called Butte's Christmas Day victory in San Francisco \\"perhaps the best football game ever put up in the West.\\" On Thanksgiving Day in 1897, the Butte football team defeated the highly regarded Oakland Reliance team 6-4 in front of 2,000 spectators in Butte. The Associated Press account of the game credited Dygert with \\"tearing great holes through the Reliance line.\\" The Butte team defeated the Reliance in a second game played three days later by a score of 4-0, and Dygert scored the game's only points on a touchdown run (scored as four points under the rules of the time). According to the Associated Press account of the game, Dygert took the ball six or eight yards from the Reliance goal and \\"went through the line\\" for the touchdown. Chicago In 1917, Dygert moved to Chicago, Illinois where he practiced law for 36 years. Family and later years Dygert married Alberta Quirk in February 1897. The couple had three children, Edward A. Dygert (born c. 1900), Jane Dygert (born c. 1903) and George B. Dygert (born c. 1906). Dygert retired in 1953 following the death of his wife, to whom he had been married for 56 years. Dygert died of a heart attack in 1957 at his home in Chicago at age 86. He was survived by his two sons and daughter.

Sources give this birthdate; however, Lopsang published a letter to Outside Magazine only weeks before his death in which he asserted that he was then 23 years old: - 25 September 1996) was a Nepalese Sherpa mountaineering guide, climber and porter, best known for his work as the climbing Sirdar for Scott Fischer's Mountain Madness expedition to Everest in Spring 1996, when a freak storm led to the deaths of eight climbers from several expeditions, considered one of the worst disasters in the history of Everest mountaineering. Notwithstanding controversy over his actions during that expedition, Lopsang was well-regarded in the mountaineering community, having summited Everest four times. Lopsang was killed in an avalanche in September 1996, while again on an expedition to climb Everest for what would have been a fifth ascent.  Mountaineering achievements  Beyond his work in the course of the ill-fated Spring 1996 Everest expedition, Lopsang was a respected porter and guide with extensive Himalayan mountaineering experience, including: :Summit, Mount Everest with Nepali Women's expedition, Spring 1993 :Summit, Cho Oyu with Japanese expedition, Fall 1993 :Camp 4, Mount Everest, Japanese expedition, Winter 1993 :Summit, Mount Everest, Sagarmatha Environmental expedition, Spring 1994 :Summit, Mount Everest, New Zealand expedition, Spring 1995, led by Rob Hall :Summit, Broad Peak, Scott Fischer party, Summer 1995 :Summit, Mount Everest, Scott Fischer party, Spring 1996 (3 hours on the summit) Lopsang reached the summit of Everest four times in four years, all without supplementary oxygen. During his career, Lopsang had worked as a climber and guide for both Rob Hall and Scott Fischer, two expedition leaders who ultimately died on Everest in the course of the 10 May 1996 tragedy.  Spring 1996 Everest disaster  By 1996, Lopsang had developed a reputation as a strong climber and capable guide, in part by his experience in helping to guide several successful expeditions with Rob Hall, a significant Himalayan expedition leader. Scott Fischer, another recognised Himalayan expedition leader, had established a new venture, Mountain Madness, and was planning a guided commercial expedition to Everest for spring 1996. Fischer, familiar with Lopsang's work and achievements, hired Lopsang to lead sherpas and assist clients as Sirdar for the Everest expedition. During the spring and fall 1996 Everest climbing seasons, fifteen climbers died on the mountain, making it the deadliest single year in Everest history. Eight of them died on 11 May alone. The disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of Everest. Journalist Jon Krakauer, on assignment from Outside magazine, was a member of one of the affected expeditions, and afterwards published the bestseller Into Thin Air, which related his experience. Anatoli Boukreev, a guide for Fischer's expedition whose actions were criticized somewhat by Krakauer, co-authored a rebuttal book called The Climb. The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community as to the proper role of climbing guides on Everest, centering on the actions of the climbers and guides from the summit parties from these two expeditions, who climbed together during the final and fateful summit push. In the course of this controversy, Lopsang's actions during that summit climb, as that of others, came under some degree of scrutiny. Prior to the summit assault on 10 May, he had carried an especially large load of equipment, including \\"30 pounds of other member's personal gear\\", and that at times he had closely assisted Sandy Pittman (a journalist member of the expedition reporting for NBC by email dispatches sent via satellite telephone and computer), using a \\"short rope\\" technique. Lopsang later explained that he himself made such decisions, so as to provide assistance to any team member \\"who was having trouble. This was to ensure that all group members would have a good chance of making the summit.\\" Lopsang acknowledged that on the day of this fateful summit push, he suffered from vomiting and fatigue, which Krakauer described as symptoms of overexertion; but Lopsang explained \\"I have been over 8,000 meters many times, each time I vomit. It is just something I do. It means nothing. I have done it on all successful expeditions, when leading or following. I did it at camp I, II, etc. For me, it has nothing to do with altitude sickness.\\" Late in the day of 10 May, as bad weather closed in, Scott Fischer reached Lopsang, who was waiting for him near the summit. Fischer and Lopsang started their descent in bad weather, as Rob Hall and Doug Hansen ascended toward the summit. Lopsang sent Fischer down the mountain and waited for Hall and Hansen to complete the summit. Lopsang reported that after ensuring that Hall and Hansen had safely summited and started their descent, he quickly descended to reach Fischer, apparently then in some difficulty. Lopsang then \\"physically dragged\\" an ill Fischer from the South Summit \\"until he could go no further\\", and waited together with him and Makalu Gau (a climber from another expedition also caught in the storm) for several hours, until Fischer finally urged Lopsang to leave and descend alone. Gau ultimately was rescued by other Sherpas; Fischer apparently moved no further before he died high on Everest. Lopsang's uncle, Ngawang Topche Sherpa, also working on the 1996 Mountain Madness expedition, fell ill and was evacuated by helicopter from Everest just prior to the fateful summit bid, suffering from a severe case of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and tuberculosis complication. Hospitalised, Ngawang remained incapacitated in Kathmandu, never recovered, and eventually died on 6 June.  September 1996 expedition  In the fall of 1996, Lopsang returned to Everest as a guide, working for a Japanese expedition. On 25 September 1996, a large avalanche erupted during the ascent on the southeast ridge route in the area between Camp III at the top of the Lhotse face, and Camp IV at the South Col, the starting point for the final summit push. The avalanche killed Lopsang, sherpa guide Dawa and a French climber, Yves Bouchon.  Personal life  Lopsang came from Beding, Nepal. He was married, with a child aged five months old, at the time of his death. His daughter Lakpa Yanzi Sherpa is currently residing inKnown Relatives Kathmandu with her aunt. See also *List of Mount Everest summiters by number of times to the summit *List of people who died climbing Mount Everest  Notes  \\"Short-roping\\" is a technique in which one climber assists another (usually done to descend to safety with a climber in distress) using a type of lanyard, or literally a \\"short rope\\", connecting the two. In this case, \\"short-roping\\" was used to assist a healthy, albeit a weaker, client by pulling the climber up the mountain during the final ascent. In his book Into Thin Air, Krakauer was extremely critical of the use of this technique in such circumstances and he quoted guide Neal Beidleman's assessment of the technique as \\"looking awkward and quite dangerous\\" for both climbers involved.

The story follows the life of 15-year-old Francesca \\"Franky\\" Pierson as she reflects on the events leading to her mother's mysterious disappearance. Through what she calls Freaky's thoughts, Franky accepts the truth about her mother's disappearance and her father's hand in it. Oates has said that the O.J Simpson case and the amount of media coverage it received inspired her to write Freaky Green Eyes. The novel's two primary themes, domestic violence and life in the media spotlight, raised questions about social taboo, teen anxiety, and the relationship between silence and truth. The novel became a critical success.

It was few weeks after her 14th birthday and she went to a college party near Puget Sound in Washington with some friends from her high school. While there, she met Cameron (a college freshman at the University of South Carolina), who tried to rape her. As a swimmer, Franky used her strong legs to kick Cameron hard enough to get him off her. Afterward, Cameron looked at her and said, \\"You should see your eyes! Freaky green eyes!\\"Oates, Joyce Carol. Freaky Green Eyes, New York City: HarperCollins, 2005. 17. Franky, now 15, lives in Yarrow Heights (a suburb of Seattle) with her father Reid Pierson, her mother Krista Pierson, her younger sister Samantha, and her half- brother Todd. As a sports reporter, Reid has had a big contract go through with a TV network and wants to celebrate with his family. Krista, however, goes to an arts and crafts convention in Santa Barbara, California instead, which angers Reid. When Krista returns home, Franky starts to notice the tension between her parents, especially after hearing them fight. She hears her mom say she does not want to go to Reid's work gatherings because she feels like she doesn't fit in with his crowd. In turn, Reid gets mad that Krista isn't fulfilling her role as a wife. Krista starts wearing scarves around her neck and long shirts to cover her wrists and arms, which Franky notices, thinking her mother is hiding something from her. Yet she cannot muster up the courage to ask her about it. Instead, she starts feeling resentful toward her mother, thinking all the fighting was Krista's fault for provoking Reid. Her younger sister, Samantha, worries that their parents will divorce but both say that that won't happen, \\"now or ever.\\" Krista moves out of the house and into a small cabin in Skagit Harbor. She starts by taking her art supplies, then clothes and her dog, Rabbit. Whenever Reid is home, Krista lives in her cabin. When he leaves to cover sporting events, she comes back home to be with her children. Samantha sometimes calls Krista and begs her to come pick them up so they could all spend time together, but Krista always says no, saying it was their father's decision. Reid, however, is saying the opposite. Samantha's frustration angers Reid so he twists her arm to make her quiet, giving her welts. For the Fourth of July, Franky and Samantha go with their father to Cape Flattery to stay with one of his friends. While there, Franky learns that Reid's friend's sons steal animals from a wildlife refuge and put them in cages to make their own zoo. In the middle of the night, Franky releases all the animals. When confronted about it the next morning, she confesses but says she's not sorry. Enraged, Reid grabs Franky and shakes her very hard, stopping only after his friend pulls him away. Later that month, Reid finally lets the girls go down to Skagit Harbor to visit their mother. Franky vaguely remembers the cabin from her childhood, recognizing the fake rooster she had thought was real as a kid. Krista shows them around the property, including a small burrow hidden underneath a rock. The reunion is cut short when Reid arrives, yelling at Franky and Samantha to pack up and get in his car. When they get in, Reid tells them Krista is having an affair and that they should never forgive her for it. After that, Krista tries to call and talk to her daughters, but Reid tells the new housekeeper to forbid it. Twyla, Franky's best friend, tells Franky that Krista calls her to talk about Franky and see how she is. Twyla tells Franky that Krista said, \\"Don't forget Mr. Rooster!\\" One night, Franky phones Krista and angrily tells her she never wants to see her again. The next day, she regrets what she said and tries to find her mother's number but can't find it. She had no idea the conversation the night before would be their last. Krista (and her friend Mero Okawa) disappear. The police interview Franky about where her father was that night, but Franky says Reid took medication for a headache and slept the entire night. During the interview, she expresses her anger at her mother, referring to her only as \\"Krista Connor,\\" not \\"mom.\\" As a result of media attention on the case, Franky and her family move to the house of Reid's defense lawyer on Vashon Island. While there, the defense lawyer coaches Samantha and Franky, telling them that if Reid would have left in the middle of the night, they would have heard him leave. During this time, \\"Freaky\\" tries to convince Franky that something is not right. One night, Franky dreams about her mother's cabin, and in the dream, the fake rooster is crowing. The next morning, Franky skips school and heads towards Skagit Harbor to visit her mother's cabin. She walks toward the barn and looks into the secret burrow, where she finds her mother's journal. Krista had kept it up throughout her separation with Reid. In the journal, Krista writes about how Reid beat and threatened to kill her. After reading the journal, Franky realizes what her father has done. She recalls waking up the night her mother disappeared, hearing Reid coming into the house through a door they never use. Franky calls her Aunt Vicky to pick her up and they go to the police station. In a second interview, Franky tells the police what she knows, not what she has been coached to say by her father or the defense lawyer. Reid is sentenced to 50 years-to-life without parole for the deaths of Krista and Mero, whose bodies were found dumped at Deception Pass. Franky and Samantha, in the custody of their aunt, move to New Mexico.

Simpson case without the whole racial angle.\\"Jay MacDonald. \\"Interview with Joyce Carol Oates.\\" BookPage. July 2008. Accessed 13 April 2010. The infamous O.J. Simpson case unfolded in 1994 when his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman were found stabbed to death outside Brown's home. The publicity during this case was greater than for any murder trial seen,Price, Richard, and Jonathan T Lovitt. \\"Confusion for Simpson kids 'far from over'.\\" USA Today. 12 December 1997. Accessed 28 March 2010. due to Simpson's fame as a former professional football player and actor, and the fact of his former interracial marriage to Brown. Evidence was introduced that he had abused his wife. After a nine-month criminal trial, in which the defense attacked the LAPD, which had a history of racism, the jury returned a not-guilty verdict. Years after the trial's conclusion, debates continue about the verdict and the issues. Oates described what was going on in the Simpson trial as \\"tabloid hell:\\" a person cannot go anywhere without someone knowing who they are and what was going on in their life. In Freaky Green Eyes, Reid Pierson's character has much in common with O.J. Simpson. He's a former pro-football player and a sports broadcaster. As Heather Humann notes in her article, \\"Domestic Violence, Child Agency, and the Adolescent Perspective in Joyce Carol Oates's Freaky Green Eyes,\\" in the book Reid's personality is portrayed as resembling that of Simpson. Oates said, \\"I'm focusing on how a person who is a celebrity is so admired that he casts a kind of aura, that people stare at the aura, and they don't really want to see that the person himself is somewhat stunted.\\"Kate Pavao. Interview with Joyce Carol Oates Publishers Weekly. 15 September 2003. Accessed 28 March 2010. Oates wanted to explore society's views toward toward celebrities accused of grave crimes. People don't want to believe it because the person is famous. Through her novel, Oates is saying that just because someone (celebrity or not) presents himself or herself as something does not mean it is what they truly are. The novel makes that point when Reid Pierson is accused of being involved in the disappearance of Krista and Mero, and the media makes up stories (or excuses). For example, in the novel the media speculates that Krista and Mero were lovers and decided to run away together. Oates says that other events, such as the Monica Lewinsky controversy, show how deeply tabloid journalism has infiltrated society, especially when used for political ends, as that case was. She uses the Lewinsky case as an example, saying that even the New York Times's coverage of the scandal was similar to the coverage by tabloids of such stories.Jay MacDonald. \\"Interview with Joyce Carol Oates\\", BookPage, July 2008. Accessed 13 April 2010. The meaning of \\"Freaky\\" While Franky is the narrator, there are times when the reader seems to hear from someone else: \\"Freaky\\", Franky's alter-ego. Throughout the novel, Franky tries to cope with and understand the whole situation. Most of the time she trusts that her father Reid tells her the truth. That's where Freaky comes in. She tries to make Franky see the truth beyond Reid's lies, even though Franky is reluctant to accept this. For example, when Reid tells Franky that Krista will come back, and Franky wants to believe him, Freaky tells her, \\"You know your mother is gone. You know she isn't coming back. Freaky knows.\\" Deep down, Franky knows her father had something to do with her mother's disappearance and that Krista was not coming back, but doesn't want to believe it. Freaky was trying to help Franky accept the truth. Freaky was not only a guide to help Franky seek the truth, but she was also the source of Franky's ethics. During Franky's trip for the Fourth of July, she meets the boys who had been taking animals out of a wildlife refuge and placing them in cages on their property. They were under-feeding the animals and treating them poorly, so Franky releases them, saying it was out of a \\"Freaky Green Eyes rush\\". Oates has said Freaky was born out of her own inability to do things she wanted to doKate Pavao. \\"Interview with Joyce Carol Oates.\\" Publishers Weekly. 15 September 2003. Accessed 28 March 2010. Freaky stopped Franky from being so naive and boosted her confidence in herself and her opinions. Without Freaky, Franky would not have been able to help solve the mystery about her mother. She wouldn't have been able to do the right thing. Reception Freaky Green Eyes received positive reviews.

Resolution 1290 examined Tuvalu's application to become the 189th member of the United Nations (UN). Tuvalu achieved independence in 1978 after over eighty years of British colonial rule. The country has struggled economically, and it took the 2000 sale of Tuvalu's Internet country code top-level domain .tv for the nation to be able to afford UN membership. Resolution 1290 was adopted unopposed, although China abstained due to concerns over Tuvalu's relationship with Taiwan. Background Tuvalu is a Polynesian island country situated in the Pacific Ocean; it has a population of approximately 11,000 people (). Tuvalu was colonised by the United Kingdom in the late nineteenth century, and in 1892 it became a protectorate as a part of the general British Western Pacific Territories. In 1916, the United Kingdom reorganized Tuvalu's administration, and the colony became a part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. Following World War Two, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization was formed, and this committee encouraged Tuvalu to begin its process of self-determination. In 1974, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands held a referendum; as a result of the vote, the two constituent parts split. The Gilbert Islands became Kiribati and the Ellice Islands became Tuvalu. Following the referendum, Tuvalu was an individual British dependency, until it declared independence on 1 October 1978. Tuvalu continued to develop as an independent nation throughout the late twentieth century but it could not afford to apply for United Nations membership due to its weak economy. In 1998 the Tuvaluan government began discussions with the International Telecommunication Union with the aim of selecting a partner who would manage .tv, the nation's top-level Internet domain. In 2000, Tuvalu, led by Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana, signed a deal by which the American firm DotTV exchanged US$50 million for the rights to .tv's administration. This deal essentially trebled Tuvalu's national income, and enabled the country to make its requisite United Nations contributions (Tuvalu's net contributions to the UN's 2001 regular budget were US$10,343). Resolution On 16 November 1999, Tuvaluan Prime Minister Ionatana wrote to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), saying that Tuvalu had met the admission requirements specified in Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter, and requesting his country's admission. On 5 January 2000, Tuvalu's membership request was officially circulated to the UNSC. Resolution 1290 was adopted on 17 February 2000 by the UNSC at its 4103rd meeting. Resolution 1290 received 14 votes in favour with none against. China abstained from the vote and said it could not approve the resolution due to Tuvalu's close relation with Taiwan. China said that Tuvaluan‚ÄìTaiwanese relations contradicted United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758. China chose not to exercise its right to veto, as it was in the interests of both China and Taiwan for Tuvalu to achieve United Nations member status. A similar situation had occurred with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1249, when Nauru's membership had been ratified despite China's abstention. On 5 September 2000, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) accepted the UNSC's recommendation without a vote and Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations.

A closely related word yali (‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ¥‡Æø ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç) refers to any structure, particularly front, that resembles the way the tip of stem of this instrument was carved into. The yazh was an open-stringed polyphonous instrument, with gut strings (narambu) with a wooden boat-shaped skin-covered resonator and an ebony stem. Historical descriptions The Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar mentions yazh in his work Thirukkural. Many major Tamil classical literary masterpieces written during Sangam period have mentioned the yazh. Silappatikaram, written by a Tamil Chera prince Ilango Adigal, mentions four kinds of yazhs: *Periyazh - 21 strings *Makarayazh - 19 strings *Cakotayazh - 14 strings *Cenkottiyazh - 7 strings Yazh was played in Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple in early centuries it was mentioned in ShaivaThirumurai 11th Pathigam.

He started his radio career in the late 1960s at 3AW in Melbourne. He spent nine years on air with a number of stations including 5AD in Adelaide, 2UW in Sydney and 6KY in Perth before moving into programming. As a programme director, he programmed four stations to No 1 in their respective markets including a record run of 34 consecutive No 1 surveys with 96FM, which he launched in 1980. He was general manager of 96FM from 1984 to 1992 when he left to take over the same role at 94.5FM in Perth. Roberts and his team quickly transformed 94.5FM (now MIX 94.5) from a poor No 5 to a strong No 1 in the Perth marketplace. In August 1993, 94.5FM purchased PMFM (now 92.9) from Kerry Packer, and Roberts was appointed managing director of both stations. Under his guidance, 92.9 and MIX 94.5 dominated the Perth radio market being the No 1 and No 2 stations while Roberts was in charge. In 1997, Austereo purchased 92.9 and MIX 94.5 for $100,000,000 and Roberts remained as managing director. Roberts was a director of the peak radio industry body for eight years, including three years as chairman of Commercial Radio Australia. This is the industry association for commercial radio representing the interests of 235 member stations nationally, including the major networks of Southern Cross Austereo, Australian Radio Network, Nova Entertainment, Fairfax and Macquarie. In 2002, Roberts resigned as managing director of Austereo Perth and after a brief holiday in Italy, accepted the role of managing director of Perth's first new commercial FM radio station in 22 years, Nova 93.7. Nova 93.7 was launched on 5 December 2002 and in its first survey in 2003, was No 1 with its core demographics. Today, Nova 93.7 is Number 1 overall and has more listeners than any other Perth radio station in history with a record of over 600,000 each week and is No 1 Under 40, Under 50 and Under 60. In April 2018, it was announced that Roberts had resigned from that role effective from the beginning of July 2018..# The launch of the Nova Network across Australia was one of the most successful brands launched in Australian radio history.

Raised in January 1920, the AAC was commanded by Major William Anderson, a former AFC pilot. Many of the AAC's members were also from the AFC and would go on to join the RAAF. Although part of the Australian Army, for most of its existence the AAC was overseen by a board of senior officers that included members of the Royal Australian Navy. Following the disbandment of the AFC, the AAC was a stop-gap measure intended to remain in place until the formation of a permanent and independent Australian air force. The corps' primary purpose was to maintain assets of the Central Flying School at Point Cook, Victoria, but several pioneering activities also took place under its auspices: AAC personnel set an Australian altitude record that stood for a decade, made the first non-stop flight between Sydney and Melbourne, and undertook the country's initial steps in the field of aviation medicine. The AAC operated fighters, bombers and training aircraft, including some of the first examples of Britain's Imperial Gift to arrive in Australia. As well as personnel, the RAAF inherited Point Cook and most of its initial equipment from the AAC. Establishment and control Richard Williams (left), who administered the AAC for the Air Board, and William Anderson, commander of the corps (pictured in 1930) In December 1919, the remnants of the wartime Australian Flying Corps (AFC) were disbanded, and replaced on 1 January 1920 by the Australian Air Corps (AAC), which was, like the AFC, part of the Australian Army. Australia's senior airman, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams, was overseas, and Major William Anderson was appointed commander of the AAC, a position that also put him in charge of the Central Flying School (CFS) at Point Cook, Victoria.Sutherland, Command and Leadership, pp. 32‚Äì34Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 17‚Äì21 As Anderson was on sick leave at the time of the appointment, Major Rolf Brown temporarily assumed command; Anderson took over on 19 February.Coulthard- Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 18, 20 CFS remained the AAC's sole unit, and Point Cook its only air base. The AAC was an interim organisation intended to exist until the establishment of a permanent Australian air service.Coulthard- Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 17‚Äì18 The decision to create such a service had been made in January 1919, amid competing proposals by the Army and the Royal Australian Navy for separate forces under their respective jurisdictions. Budgetary constraints and arguments over administration and control led to ongoing delays in the formation of an independent air force.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 3‚Äì7 By direction of the Chief of the General Staff, Major General Gordon Legge, in November 1919, the AAC's prime purpose was to ensure existing aviation assets were maintained; Legge later added that it should also perform suitable tasks such as surveying air routes. The Chief of the Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Sir Percy Grant, objected to the AAC's being under Army control, and argued that an air board should be formed to oversee the AAC and the proposed Australian air force.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 8‚Äì9 A temporary air board first met on 29 January 1920, the Army being represented by Williams and Brigadier General Thomas Blamey, and the Navy by Captain Wilfred Nunn and Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Goble, a former member of Britain's Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) then seconded to the Navy Office.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 27‚Äì28 Williams was given responsibility for administering the AAC on behalf of the board. A permanent Air Board overseen by an Air Council was formed on 9 November 1920; these bodies were made responsible for administering the AAC from 22 November.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 10‚Äì12 Personnel Most members of the AAC were former AFC personnel. In August 1919, several senior AFC pilots, including Lieutenant Colonel Oswald Watt, Major Anderson, and Captain Roy Phillipps, were appointed to serve on a committee examining applications for the AAC.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 20 Some of the staffing decisions were controversial. At least three officers at the CFS, including the commanding officer, were not offered appointments in the new service.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 19 Roy King, the AFC's second highest-scoring fighter ace after Harry Cobby, refused an appointment in the AAC because it had not yet offered a commission to Victoria Cross recipient Frank McNamara.Newton, Australian Air Aces, p. 43 In a letter dated 30 January 1920, King wrote, \\"I feel I must forfeit my place in favor (sic) of this very good and gallant officer\\"; McNamara received a commission in the AAC that April. Other former AFC members who took up appointments in the AAC included Captains Adrian Cole, Henry Wrigley, Frank Lukis, and Lawrence Wackett.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 20, 36, 191 Captain Hippolyte \\"Kanga\\" De La Rue, an Australian who flew with the RNAS during the war, was granted a commission in the AAC because a specialist seaplane pilot was required for naval cooperation work. Arthur Murphy (middle row, centre), 1921 The corps' initial establishment was nine officers‚Äîcommanding officer, adjutant, workshop commander, test pilot, four other pilots, and medical officer‚Äîand seventy other ranks.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 18 In March 1920, to cope with the imminent arrival of new aircraft and other equipment, approval was given to increase this complement by a further seven officers and thirty-six other ranks. The following month the establishment was increased by fifty-four to make a total of 160 other ranks. An advertising campaign was employed to garner applicants.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 22 According to The Age, applicants needed to be aged between eighteen and forty-five, and returned soldiers were preferred; all positions were \\"temporary\\" and salaries, including uniform allowance and rations, ranged from ¬£194 to ¬£450. As the AAC was an interim formation, no unique uniform was designed for its members. Within three weeks of the AAC being raised, a directive came down from CFS that the organisation's former AFC staff should wear out their existing uniforms, and that any personnel requiring new uniforms should acquire \\"AIF pattern, as worn by the AFC\\". The AAC suffered two fatalities. On 23 September 1920, two Airco DH.9A bombers recently delivered from Britain undertook a search for the schooner Amelia J., which had disappeared on a voyage from Newcastle to Hobart. Anderson and Sergeant Herbert Chester flew one of the DH.9As, and Captain Billy Stutt and Sergeant Abner Dalzell the other. Anderson's aircraft landed near Hobart in the evening, having failed to locate the lost schooner, but Stutt and Dalzell were missing; their DH.9A was last sighted flying through cloud over Bass Strait. A court of inquiry determined the aircraft had crashed, and that the DH.9As may not have had adequate preparation time for their task, which it attributed to the low staffing levels at CFS. The court proposed compensation of ¬£550 for Stutt's family and ¬£248 for Dalzell's‚Äîthe maximum amounts payable under government regulations‚Äîas the men had been on duty at the time of their deaths; Federal Cabinet increased these payments three-fold. Wreckage that may have belonged to the Amelia J. was found at Flinders Island the following year.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 25‚Äì26 Equipment alt=Side view of single-engined biplane surrounded by five men The AAC's initial complement of aircraft included twenty Avro 504K trainers and twelve Sopwith Pup fighters that had been delivered to CFS in 1919, as well as a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 and F.E.2, and a Bristol Scout. Seven of the 504Ks and one of the Pups were written off during the AAC's existence, leaving thirteen and eleven on strength, respectively.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 4, 157‚Äì158, 162 The B.E.2 had been piloted by Wrigley and Arthur Murphy in 1919 on the first flight from Melbourne to Darwin, and was allotted to the Australian War Memorial in August 1920; the F.E.2 was sold in November 1920, while the Scout remained on strength and was still being flown by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1923.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 157 In February 1920, the Vickers Vimy bomber recently piloted by Ross and Keith Smith on the first flight from England to Australia was flown to Point Cook, where it joined the strength of the AAC.Campbell-Wright, An Interesting Point, pp. 66‚Äì71 In March 1920, Australia began receiving 128 aircraft with associated spares and other equipment as part of Britain's Imperial Gift to Dominions seeking to establish their own post-war air services. The aircraft included Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 fighters, Airco DH.9 and DH.9A bombers, and Avro 504s. Most remained crated for eventual use by the yet-to-be formed RAAF, but several of each type were assembled and employed by the AAC. One of the DH.9As was lost with the disappearance of Stutt and Dalzell in September 1920.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 162 Notable flights On 17 June 1920, Cole, accompanied by De La Rue, flew a DH.9A to an altitude of , setting an Australian record that stood for more than ten years. The effects of hypoxia exhibited by Cole and De La Rue intrigued the medical officer, Captain Arthur Lawrence, who subsequently made observations during his own high- altitude flight piloted by Anderson; this activity has been credited as marking the start of aviation medicine in Australia.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 23Campbell-Wright, An Interesting Point, pp. 73‚Äì74 Later that month, flying an Avro 504L floatplane, De La Rue became the first person to land an aircraft on the Yarra River in Victoria.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 24 On 22 July, Williams, accompanied by Warrant Officer Les Carter, used a DH.9A to make the first non-stop flight from Sydney to Melbourne. A few days earlier, Williams and Wackett had flown two DH.9As to the Royal Military College, Duntroon, to investigate the possibility of taking some of the school's graduates into the air corps, a plan that came to fruition after the formation of the RAAF.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 191‚Äì192 Cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, inspecting the DH.9s flown by Williams and Lawrence Wackett, July 1920 Between July and November 1920, trials of the Avro 504L took place on the Navy's flagship, HMAS Australia, and later aboard the light cruiser HMAS Melbourne.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 20, 215 The trials on Melbourne, which operated in the waters off New Guinea and northern Australia, demonstrated that the Avro was not suited to tropical conditions as its engine lacked the necessary power and its skin deteriorated rapidly; Williams recommended that activity cease until Australia acquired a purpose-designed seaplane.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 215 The AAC performed several tasks in connection with the Prince of Wales' tour of Australia in 1920. In May, the AAC was required to escort the Prince's ship, HMS Renown, into Port Melbourne, and then to fly over the royal procession along St Kilda Road. The AAC had more aircraft than pilots available, so Williams gained permission from the Minister for Defence to augment AAC aircrew with former AFC pilots seeking to volunteer their services for the events. In August, the AAC was called upon at the last minute to fly the Prince's mail from Port Augusta, South Australia, to Sydney before he boarded Renown for the voyage back to Britain.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 23‚Äì24 During the Second Peace Loan, which commenced in August 1920, the AAC undertook a cross-country program of tours and exhibition flying to promote the sale of government bonds. Again Williams enlisted the services of former AFC personnel to make up for a shortfall in the number of AAC pilots and mechanics available to prepare and fly the nineteen aircraft allotted to the program. Activities included flyovers at sporting events, leaflet drops over Melbourne, and what may have been Australia's first aerial derby‚Äîat Serpentine, Victoria, on 27 August. Poor weather hindered some of the program, and four aircraft were lost in accidents, though no aircrew were killed. The Second Peace Loan gave AAC personnel experience in a variety of flying conditions, and the air service gained greater exposure to the Australian public.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 14, 24‚Äì25 Disbandment and legacy On 15 March 1921, the Brisbane Courier reported that the AAC would disband on 30 March, and be succeeded by a new air force. The Australian Air Force was formed on 31 March, inheriting Point Cook and most of its initial personnel and equipment from the AAC. The \\"Royal\\" prefix was added to \\"Australian Air Force\\" that August. Several officers associated with the AAC, including Williams, Anderson, Wrigley and McNamara, went on to achieve high rank in the Air Force. According to the RAAF's Pathfinder bulletin, the AAC \\"kept valuable aviation skills alive\\" until a permanent air force could be established. The corps was, further, \\"technically separate from the Army and Navy; its director answered to the Minister for Defence, through the Air Council. In effect, the AAC was Australia's first independent air force, albeit an interim one.\\" NotesReferences * * * * * Category:Australian military aviation Category:Aviation history of Australia Category:Military units and formations established in 1920 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1921 ","title":"Australian Air Corps"},{"id":"26875658","text":"A medical examination Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for. Meta-studies of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is \\"no discernible effect\\" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had \\"small, but significant, effect sizes\\" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings. Statistical trends in an additional 5 of the 17 studies favored the prayer group over the control group. Introduction In comparison to other fields that have been scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of prayer are relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research. If and when more studies of prayer are done, the issue of prayer's efficacy may be further clarified.Boorstein, Michelle. Researchers Stepping Up Study of Health And Religiosity, Washington Post, 6 December 2008. The third party studies discussed here have all been performed using Christian prayers. Some have reported null results, some have reported correlations between prayer and health, and some have reported contradictory results in which beneficiaries of prayer had worsened health outcomes. The parameters used within the study designs have varied, for instance, daily or weekly prayers, whether to provide patient photographs, with full or partial names, measuring levels of belief in prayer, and whether patients underwent surgery. Studies=Galton In 1872, the Victorian scientist Francis Galton made the first statistical analysis of third-party prayer. He hypothesized, partly as satire, that if prayer were effective, members of the British Royal Family would live longer than average, given that thousands prayed for their well- being every Sunday, and he prayed over randomized plots of land to see whether the plants would grow any faster, and found no correlation in either case. Byrd and Harris A 1988 study by Randolph C. Byrd used 393 patients at the San Francisco General Hospital coronary care unit (CCU). Measuring 29 health outcomes using three-level (good, intermediate, or bad) scoring, the prayer group suffered fewer newly diagnosed ailments on only six of them. Byrd concluded that \\"Based on these data there seemed to be an effect, and that effect was presumed to be beneficial\\", and that \\"intercessory prayer to the Judeo-Christian God has a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients admitted to a CCU.\\" The reaction from the scientific community concerning this study was mixed. Several reviewers considered Byrd‚Äôs study to be well-designed and well-executed,Chamberlain and Hall 2001, 34 while others remained skeptical. A criticism of Byrd's study, which also applies to most other studies, is the fact that he did not limit prayers by the friends and family of patients, hence it is unclear which prayers, if any, may have been measured. The Byrd study had an inconsistent pattern of only six positive outcomes amongst 26 specific problem conditions. A systematic review suggested this indicates possible Type I errors. A 1999 follow-up by William S. Harris et al. attempted to replicate Byrd's findings under stricter experimental conditions, noting that the original research was not completely blinded and was limited to only \\"prayer-receptive\\" individuals (57 of the 450 patients invited to participate in the study refused to give consent \\"for personal reasons or religious convictions\\"). Using a different, continuous weighted scoring system ‚Äì which admittedly was, like Byrd's scoring, \\"an unvalidated measure of CCU outcomes\\" ‚Äì Harris et al. concluded that \\"supplementary, remote, blinded, intercessory prayer produced a measurable improvement in the medical outcomes of critically ill patients\\", and suggested that \\"prayer be an effective adjunct to standard medical care.\\"Harris et al. 1999, 2273 However, when they applied Byrd‚Äôs scores to their data, they could not document an effect of prayer using his scoring method. Critics have suggested that both Byrd's and Harris's results can be explained by chance. Richard P. Sloan compared the Byrd and Harris studies with the sharpshooter fallacy, \\"searching through the data until a significant effect is found, then drawing the bull's-eye.\\" O'Laoire A 1997 study by O'Laoire measured the effects on the agents performing daily prayers and reported benefits not only for the beneficiaries, but also for the agents, and the benefit levels correlated with the belief levels of agents and beneficiaries in some cases. The study measured anxiety and depression. This study used beneficiary names as well as photographs. Sicher In 1998 Fred Sicher et al. supposedly performed a small scale double-blind randomized study of 40 patients with advanced AIDS.Textbook of Integrative Mental Health Care by James Lake 2006 page 112 The patients were in category C-3 with CD4 cell counts below 200 and each had at least one case of AIDS-defining illness.Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Mental Health edited by Scott Shannon 2001 Academic Press page 259 The patients were randomly assigned to receive distant intercessory healing or none at all. The intercession took place by people in different parts of the United States who never had any contact with the patients. Both patients and physicians were blind to who received or did not receive intercession. Six months later the prayer group had fewer AIDS illnesses, less frequent doctor visits, and fewer days in the hospital. However, CD4 counts and scores on other physiological tests had no significant variation between the two groups of patients. Years later this study was debunked. The original research showed no significance so the researchers went data dredging. They isolated the few statistical figures that were significant and discarded the rest, including one metric which showed prayer had a negative outcome. A later study which attempted to replicate the original found no significant difference between the study group and the control group. Mayo clinic A 2001 double-blind study at the Mayo Clinic randomized 799 discharged coronary surgery patients into a control group and an intercessory prayer group, which received prayers at least once a week from 5 intercessors per patient. Analyzing \\"primary end points\\" (death, cardiac arrest, rehospitalization, etc.) after 26 weeks, the researchers concluded \\"intercessory prayer had no significant effect on medical outcomes after hospitalization in a coronary care unit.\\" The IVF-ET prayer scandal In 2001 the Journal of Reproductive Medicine published an experimental study by three Columbia University researchers indicating that prayer for women undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) resulted in a success rate (50%) of pregnancy double that of women who did not receive prayer. Columbia University issued a news release saying that the study had been carefully designed to eliminate bias. The most vocal skeptic was Bruce Flamm, a clinical professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the University of California at Irvine, who found that the experimental procedures were flawed. One of the study's authors, Cha, responded to criticism of the study in the November 2004 issue of JRM. In December 2001, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS) office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) confirmed a report by the Columbia University Health Sciences Division that one of the study‚Äôs authors, Rogerio Lobo, only learned of the study six to twelve months after the study was completed, and that he had only provided editorial assistance.https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/dec01f.pdf The name of Columbia University and Lobo were retracted from the study. Retroactive intercessory prayer A 2001 study by Leonard Leibovici used records of 3,393 patients who had developed blood infections at the Rabin Medical Center between 1990 and 1996 to study retroactive intercessory prayer. To compound the alleged miraculous power of prayer itself, the prayers were performed after the patients had already left the hospital. All 3,393 patients were those in the hospital between 1990 and 1996, and the prayers were conducted in 2000. Two of the outcomes, length of stay in the hospital and duration of fever, were found to be significantly improved in the intervention group, implying that prayer can even change events in the past. However, the \\"mortality rate was lower in the intervention group, but the difference between the groups was not significant.\\" Leibovici concluded that \\"Remote, retroactive intercessory prayer was associated with a shorter stay in hospital and a shorter duration of fever in patients with a bloodstream infection.\\" Leibovici goes on to note that in the past, people knew the way to prevent diseases (he cites scurvy) without understanding why it worked. In saying so, he suggests that if prayer truly does have a positive effect on patients in hospital, then there may be a naturalist explanation for it that we do not yet understand. After many scientists and scholars criticized this retroactive study, Leibovici stated in 2002 that the \\"article has nothing to do with religion. I believe that prayer is a real comfort and help to a believer. I do not believe it should be tested in controlled trials.\\" The study has been summarised as being \\"intended lightheartedly to illustrate the importance of asking research questions that fit with scientific models.\\" In 2003, Larry Dossey, the executive editor of the journal Explore: The Journal of Science & Healing and an advocate of faith healing co-authored a paper responding to Leibovici which discussed possible mechanisms to explain the results reported. Olshansky and Dossey invoked quantum mechanics to explain not only the benefits of intercessory prayer, but also how it might operate retroactively, drawing strong criticisms from physicist Victor Stenger and physician Jeffrey Bishop. The observer effect is regularly used to suggest that conscious control of physical reality is predicted by quantum mechanics, but this misconception \\"can be traced to a misinterpretation of wave-particle duality.\\" In relation to backwards causality, Stenger noted that \\"the results of some quantum experiments may be interpreted as evidence for events in the future affecting events in the past at the quantum level, [but] no theoretical basis exists for applying this notion on the macroscopic scale of human experience.\\" He concluded that while \\"the atoms in biological systems are quantum in nature ... their collective behaviour does not exhibit any quantum effects. ... What is more, even if the brain were a quantum system, that would not imply that it can break the laws of physics any more than electrons or photons, which are inarguably quanta.\\" One further point which illustrates that Dossey and Olshansky do not understand the physics they are using is seen in their invocation of quantum nonlocality in explaining backward causation, stating that \\"[r]etroactive prayer may be less absurd than [Leibovici] supposes, in the light of the discovery of non-local phenomena.\\" Unfortunately, the two are mutually incompatible: in allowing reverse causality in a model, the phenomenon of nonlocality ceases. Dossey has written in Explore about coining the term \\"nonlocal mind\\" in 1987, though quantum nonlocality goes back to a 1935 paper by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. Olshansky and Dossey defended their work from various critics in the British Medical Journal's rapid response section Olensky and Dossey are not alone amongst alternative medicine proponents in having missed the point which Leibovici was making. In 2004, Stephen Wright described the Olshansky and Dossey contribution as a \\"thoughtful essay,\\" and it was praised by an editorial in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine the same year. In 2005, Olshansky and Dossey's work was included in a critical review published in Explore which concluded that \\"Religious activity may improve health outcomes.\\" Their work was also defended in the British Medical Journal itself in 2004. Dossey authored an Explore paper defending experiments on the medical effects of prayer in 2005. The MANTRA study A 2005 MANTRA (Monitoring and Actualisation of Noetic Trainings) II study conducted a three-year clinical trial led by Duke University comparing intercessory prayer and MIT (Music, Imagery, and Touch) therapies for 748 cardiology patients. The study is regarded as the first time rigorous scientific protocols were applied on a large scale to assess the feasibility of intercessory prayer and other healing practices. The study produced null results and the authors concluded, \\"Neither masked prayer nor MIT therapy significantly improved clinical outcome after elective catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention.\\" Neither study specified whether photographs were used or whether belief levels were measured in the agents or those performing the prayers. The STEP project Harvard professor Herbert Benson performed a \\"Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)\\" in 2006. The STEP, commonly called the \\"Templeton Foundation prayer study\\" or \\"Great Prayer Experiment\\", used 1,802 coronary artery bypass surgery patients at six hospitals. Using double-blind protocols, patients were randomized into three groups, individual prayer receptiveness was not measured. The members of the experimental and control Groups 1 and 2 were informed they might or might not receive prayers, and only Group 1 received prayers. Group 3, which served as a test for possible psychosomatic effects, was informed they would receive prayers and subsequently did. Unlike some other studies, STEP attempted to standardize the prayer method. Only first names and last initial for patients were provided and no photographs were supplied. Catholics and members of the New Thought church Silent Unity who prayed for the patients \\"were allowed to pray in their own manner, but they were instructed to include the following phrase in their prayers: \\"for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications\\". Some participants complained that this mechanical way they were told to pray as part of the experiment was unusual for them. Complications of surgery occurred in 52 percent of those who received prayer (Group 1), 51 percent of those who did not receive it (Group 2), and 59 percent of patients who knew they would receive prayers (Group 3). There were no statistically significant differences in major complications or thirty-day mortality. In The God Delusion, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins wrote, \\"It seems more probable that those patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered additional stress in consequence: performance anxiety', as the experimenters put it. Dr Charles Bethea, one of the researchers, said, \\"It may have made them uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?'\\" Study co- author Jeffery Dusek stated that: \\"Each study builds on others, and STEP advanced the design beyond what had been previously done. The findings, however, could well be due to the study limitations.\\" Team leader Benson stated that STEP was not the last word on the effects of intercessory prayer and that questions raised by the study will require additional answers. Literature reviews A meta-analysis of several studies related to distant intercessory healing was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2000.John A. Astin, et al. The Efficacy of \\"Distant Healing\\" A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials Annals of Internal Medicine June 6, 2000 vol. 132 no. 11 903-910 The authors analyzed 23 trials of 2,774 patients. Five of the trials were for prayer as the distant healing method, 11 were with noncontact touch, and 7 were other forms. Of these trials, 13 showed statistically significant beneficial treatment results, 9 showed no effect, and 1 showed a negative result. The authors concluded that it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding distant healing and suggested further studies. A 2003 levels of evidence review found \\"some\\" evidence for the hypothesis that \\"Being prayed for improves physical recovery from acute illness\\". It concluded that although \\"a number of studies\\" have tested this hypothesis, \\"only three have sufficient rigor for review here\\" (Byrd 1988, Harris et al. 1999, and Sicher et al. 1998). In all three, \\"the strongest findings were for the variables that were evaluated most subjectively. This raises concerns about the possible inadvertent unmasking of the outcomes assessors. Moreover, the absence of a clearly plausible biological mechanism by which such a treatment could influence hard medical outcome results in the inclination to be skeptical of results.\\" This 2003 review was performed before the 2005 MANTRA study and the 2006 STEP project, neither of which were conclusive in establishing the efficacy of prayer. Various broader meta-studies of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that \\"There is no scientifically discernable effect for intercessory prayer as assessed in controlled studies\\". However, a 2007 systemic review of 17 intercessory prayer studies found \\"small, but significant, effect sizes for the use of intercessory prayer\\" in 7 studies , but \\"prayer was unassociated with positive improvement in the condition of client\\" in the other 10, concluding that based upon the American Psychology Association's Division 12 (clinical psychology) criteria for evidence-based practice, intercessory prayer \\"must be classified as an experimental intervention.\\" The review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies had failed to produce significant findings. Statistical trends in an additional 5 of the 17 studies favored the prayer group over the control group.

While most mineral resources will not be exhausted in the near future, global extraction and production is becoming more challenging.Mudd, G M, 2010, The Environmental Sustainability of Mining in Australia: Key Mega-Trends and Looming Constraints. Resources Policy, . Miners have found ways over time to extract deeper and lower grade ores with lower production costs. More than anything else, declining average ore grades are indicative of ongoing technological shifts that have enabled inclusion of more 'complex' processing ‚Äì in social and environmental terms as well as economic ‚Äì and structural changes in the minerals exploration industry and these have been accompanied by significant increases in identified Mineral Reserves.  Definition  The concept of peak minerals offers a useful model for representing the changing impacts associated with processing declining resource qualities in the lead up to, and following, peak mineral production in a particular region within a certain time-frame.Giurco, D., Prior, T., Mudd, G., Mason, L. and Behrisch, J. (2009). Peak minerals in Australia: a review of changing impacts and benefits. Prepared for CSIRO Minerals Down Under Flagship, by the Institute for Sustainable Futures (University of Technology, Sydney) and Department of Civil Engineering (Monash University), March 2010. Peak minerals provides an analytical framework within which the economic, social and environmental trajectories of a particular mining industry can be explored in relation to the continuing (and often increasing) production of mineral resources. It focuses consideration on the change in costs and impacts associated with processing easily accessible, lower cost ores before peak production of an individual mine or group of mines for a given mineral. It outlines how the economy might respond as processing becomes characterised by higher costs as the peak is approached and passed. Issues associated with the concept of peak minerals include: * Average processed ore grades are in global decline for some minerals whilst production is increasing. * Average discovered ore grades (e.g., in porphyry copper deposits) have remained remarkably steady over the last 150 years. * Structural changes in the minerals exploration industry and the recent focus on \\"brownfields\\" exploration * Mining is extending to deeper, more remote deposits. * Individual mines or mining provinces can eventually become exhausted, though changes in demand and mining technology can act to prolong their productive lives.  Resource depletion and recoverability  Giurco et al. (2009)Giurco, D., Evans, G., Cooper, C., Mason, L. & Franks, D. (2009) \\"Mineral Futures Discussion Paper: Sustainability Issues, Challenges and Opportunities\\". Institute for Sustainable Futures, UTS and Sustainable Minerals Institute, University of Queensland. indicate that the debate about how to analytically describe resource depletion is ongoing. Traditionally, a fixed stock paradigm has been applied, but Tilton and Lagos (2007)Tilton, J. & Lagos, G. (2007) \\"Assessing the long-run availability of copper.\\" Resources Policy, 32, 19‚Äì23 suggest using an opportunity cost paradigm is better because the usable resource quantity is represented by price and the opportunity cost of using the resource. Unlike energy minerals such as coal or oil ‚Äì or minerals used in a dissipative or metabolic fashion like phosphorusCordell, D., Drangert, J.-O. & White, S. (2009) \\"The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought\\". Global Environmental Change, 19, 292‚Äì305. ‚Äì most non-energy minerals and metals are unlikely to run out. Metals are inherently recyclable and more readily recoverable from end uses where the metal is used in a pure form and not transformed or dissipated; in addition, metal ore is accessible at a range of different grades. So, although metals are not facing exhaustion, they are becoming more challenging to obtain in the quantities that society demands, and the energy, environmental and social cost of acquiring them could constrain future increases in production and usage.  Peak oil  Given increasing global population and rapidly growing consumption (especially in China and India), frameworks for the analysis of resource depletion can assist in developing appropriate responses. The most popular contemporary focus for resource depletion is oil (or petroleum) resources. In 1956, oil geologist M. King Hubbert famously predicted that conventional oil production from the lower 48 (mainland) states of the United States would peak by 1970 and then enter a terminal decline.Hubbert, M. K. (1956) Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuel. Drilling and Production Practice. This model was accurate in predicting the peak (although the peak year was 1971). This phenomenon is now commonly called 'peak oil', with peak production curves known as Hubbert Curves. The concept of peak minerals is an extrapolation and extension of Hubbert's model of peak oil. Although widely cited for his predictions of peak oil, Hubbert intended to explore an appropriate response to the finite supply of oil, and framed this work within the context of increasing global population and rapidly growing consumption of oil. In establishing the peak oil model, Hubbert was primarily focused on arguing that a planned transition was required to ensure future energy services. World gold production has experienced multiple peaks due to new discoveries and new technologies. Many mineral resources have exhibited logistic Hubbert-type production trends in the past, but have transitioned to exponential growth during the last 10‚Äì15 years, precluding reliable estimates of reserves from within the framework of the logistic model.Rustad, J. R. (2011) Peak Nothing: Recent Trends in Mineral Resource Production https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4753  As extrapolating peak oil  Only limited substantive work is currently undertaken to examine how the concepts and assumptions of peak oil can be extrapolated so as to be applied to minerals in general.Heinberg, R. (2007). Peak Everything: Waking Up to the Century of Declines, Gabriola Island, BC, Canada, New Society Publishers.Mudd, G. M. & Ward, J. D. (2008) \\"Will Sustainability Constraints Cause 'Peak Minerals'?\\" 3rd International Conference on Sustainability Engineering and Science: Blueprints for Sustainable Infrastructure. Auckland, New Zealand When extrapolating peak oil to account for peak minerals and then utilising this analytical 'peak framework' as a general model of resource exploitation, several factors must be taken into consideration: *Accurate estimates of easily accessible proven reserves; *Political and market stability; *Affordable, stable prices for consumers and enticing profits for producers; *Exponentially increasing consumption; *Independent producers focused only on maximising their immediate profits; *Perceived abundance of and availability of other reserves (e.g. US, Middle Eastern). In understanding how these factors are important for modelling peak minerals, it is important to consider assumptions concerning the modelling process, assumptions about production (particularly economic conditions), and the ability to make accurate estimates of resource quantity and quality and the potential of future exploration.  Cheap and easy in the past; costly and difficult in future  Peak production poses a problem for resource rich countries like Australia, which have developed a comparative advantage in the global resources sector, which may diminish in the future. The costs of mining, once primarily reflected in economic terms, are increasingly being considered in social and environmental terms, although these are yet to meaningfully inform long-term decision-making in the sector. Such consideration is particularly important if the industry is seeking to operate in a socially, environmentally and economically sustainable manner into the next 30‚Äì50 years.  Benefits from dependence on the resource sector  In 2008‚Äì09, minerals and fuel exports made up around 56% of Australia‚Äôs total exports. Consequently, minerals play a major role in Australia‚Äôs capacity to participate in international trade and contribute to the international strength of its currency.AusI MM (2006) Australian Mineral Economics, Carlton, The Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Whether this situation contributes to Australia‚Äôs economic wealth or weakens its economic position is contested. While those supporting Australia‚Äôs reliance on minerals cite the theory of comparative advantage, opponents suggest a reliance on resources leads to issues associated with 'Dutch disease' (a decline in other sectors of the economy associated with natural resource exploitation) and ultimately the hypothesised ‚Äòresource curse‚Äô.  Threats from dependence on the resource sector  Contrary to the theory of the comparative advantage, many mineral resource-rich countries are often outperformed by resource-poor countries.Auty, R. M. & Mikesell, R. F. (1998) Sustainable development in mineral economies, Oxford, Oxford University This paradox, where natural resource abundance actually has a negative impact on the growth of the national economy is termed the resource curse. After an initial economic boost, brought on by the booming minerals economy, negative impacts linked to the boom surpass the positive, causing economic activity to fall below the pre-resource windfall level. = Mineral supply and demand = The economics of a commodity are generally determined by supply and demand. Mineral supply and demand will change dramatically as all costs (economic, technological, social and environmental) associated with production, processing and transportation of minerals increases with falling ore grades. These costs will ultimately influence the ability of companies to supply commodities, and the ability of consumers to purchase them. It is likely that social and environmental issues will increasingly drive economic costs associated with supply and demand patterns.Esteves, A. M. (2008) \\"Mining and social development: Refocusing community investment using multi-criteria decision analysis\\". Resources Policy, 33, 39‚Äì47. Hamann, R. (2004) \\"Corporate social responsibility, partnerships, and institutional change: The case of mining companies in South Africa\\". Natural Resources Forum, 28, 278‚Äì90.Jenkins, H. & Yakovleva, N. (2006) Corporate social responsibility in the mining industry: Exploring trends in social and environmental disclosure. Journal of Cleaner Production, 14, 271‚Äì84. = Economic scarcity as a constraint to mineral supply = As neither overall stocks nor future markets are known, most economists normally do not consider physical scarcity as a good indicator for the availability of a resource for society.Barnett, HJ, GM Van Muiswinkel and M. Schechter, (1981). \\"Are Minerals Costing More?\\" Int. Inst Appi. Syst. Anal., Work. Pap. No. WP-81-20. –ü ASA, Laxenburg, Austria Economic scarcity has subsequently been introduced as a more valid approach to assess the supply of minerals. There are three commonly accepted measures for economic scarcity: the user costs associated with a resource, the real price of the resource, and the resource‚Äôs extraction costs. These measures have historically externalised impacts of a social or environmental nature ‚Äì so might be considered inaccurate measures of economic scarcity given increased environmental or social scrutiny in the mining industry. Internalisation of these costs will contribute to economic scarcity by increasing the user costs, the real price of the resource, and its extraction costs. = Demand for minerals = While the ability to supply a commodity determines its availability as has been demonstrated, demand for minerals can also influence their availability. How minerals are used, where they are distributed and how, trade barriers, downstream use industries, substitution and recycling can potentially influence the demand for minerals, and ultimately their availability. While economists are cognisant of the role of demand as an availability driver, historically they have not considered factors besides depletion as having a long-term impact on mineral availability.Yaksic, A. & Tilton, J. E. (2009) \\"Using the cumulative availability curve to assess the threat of mineral depletion: The case of lithium\\". Resources Policy, 34(4): 185‚Äì94.  Future production  There are a variety of indicators that show production is becoming more difficult and more expensive. Key environmental indicators that reflect increasingly expensive production are primarily associated with the decline in average ore grades of many minerals.Mudd, G. M. (2007) \\"Gold mining in Australia: linking historical trends and environmental and resources sustainability\\". Environmental Science & Policy, 10, 629‚Äì44. This has consequences in mineral exploration, for mine depth, the energy intensity of mining, and the increasing quantity of waste rock. Although new mineral deposits are still being discovered, and reserves are increasing for some minerals, these are of lower quality and are less accessible.  Social context  Different social issues must be addressed through time in relation to peak minerals at a national scale, and other issues manifest on the local scale. As global mining companies seek to expand operations to access larger mining areas, competition with farmers for land and for scare water is becoming increasingly intense.Hamann, R. (2003) \\"Mining companies' role in sustainable development: the 'why' and 'how' of corporate social responsibility from a business perspective\\". Development Southern Africa, 20, 237‚Äì54. Negative relationships with near neighbours influence companies' ability to establish and maintain a social license to operate within the community.Brereton, D., Moran, C.

Access to identified resources is becoming harder as questions are asked about the benefit from the regional economic development mining is reputed to bring.

Influenced by popular music of the late 1970s and early 1980s, his music and production contains elements of many different genres, including funk, rock, pop, soul and hip hop. Styles gained his stage name by playing several different \\"styles\\" of music. Career=Florida (1993-2003) After majoring in Instrumental Jazz Performance at the University of South Florida, he was hired as guitarist/keyboardist for Atlantic recording artist Savatage. In October 1993, after a full US and European tour, his stint with Savatage was ended abruptly when founding member/guitarist, Criss Oliva, was killed by a drunk driver. Shortly after Oliva's death, Wes recorded a self- titled instrumental acoustic guitar album (using his birth name Wesley Charlton Garren) dedicated to Criss's memory. In 1994, Wes won first place in the Best of the Bay guitar competition, in which the prize was a Gibson Les Paul that became his main guitar. In addition to running his own recording studio, giving music lessons, and playing in cover bands, Wes also formed several original bands, including Skunkworks, Ouch, Ramona Ramonster, and Surely T & the Saints of Pain. In 1999, he was runner-up in Tommy Hilfiger's Unsigned Artist of the Millennium contest. He also briefly played guitar in a rock band that was managed by Orlando bigwigs, Johnny Wright and Lou Pearlman. Before moving to California, he finished production on the first Wes Styles album, Pop Culture Poison, in which he played most of the instruments himself. California (2003-present) Soon after moving to North Hollywood, Wes played keyboards with Ty Taylor. He got signed to an indie label, called Jecarco Entertainment, but left shortly after creative differences with the label CEO, and consequently finished his second Wes Styles album, the Betamax Collection, on his own and released it independently. Wes later played guitar in many acclaimed LA bands such as Sextus, Fantastic Black, J Davey, The Fuxedos, Jeff Fowler, AM/FM and Keram Malicki-S√°nchez. In 2007, Wes started touring full-time as the keyboardist for progressive rock band Coheed and Cambria. He can be seen on Coheed's live Neverender DVD, and heard on their 2010 studio album, Year of the Black Rainbow. He also acted as their substitute bassist in 2011 when Michael Todd was arrested for attempted armed robbery during their tour with Soundgarden. In 2008, while touring with Coheed and Cambria, Styles became endorsed by Moog Music. In January 2009, he played in the Neil Sedaka play, Breaking Up is Hard to Do, in which Sedaka made a guest appearance and performed \\"Love Will Keep Us Together.\\" Discography=As Wesley Charlton Garren *Wesley Charlton Garren As Wes Styles *Pop Culture Poison (2003) :Keyboard Magazine's review of Pop Culture Poison stated that, \\"if pop culture is truly poisoned, then Wes Styles may very well be the antidote.\\"http://www.keyboardmag.com/ :Included performances by Matt Mahaffey, Ronnie Dee, and Roger Delillo. *The Betamax Collection (2008) *Afterlife (2012) *The Latter Day Sins (2014) *Stereophilia (2017) ReferencesExternal links * Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Living people Category:Savatage members Category:1970 births Category:21st-century American singers ","title":"Wes Styles"},{"id":"26875841","text":"Moreeb Dune at Liwa thumb Moreeb Dune or Tal Moreeb () is a large sized sand dune located in proximity of Liwa Oasis at the Empty Quarter desert in the United Arab Emirates.

' (Church of the Holy Spirit; ) is a Gothic hall church in Munich, southern Germany, originally belonging to the Hospice of the Holy Ghost (14th century).  History  It was remodelled in 1724‚Äì30 by (vaults, renovation of pillars); in the interior are Rococo frescoes and stucco ornament by the Asam brothers. After the demolition of the hospice buildings in 1885, Franz L≈°wel added three bays at the west end of the church and gave it a Neo-Baroque facade. The church suffered severe damage during World War II and its interior furnishings were largely destroyed; extensive rebuilding and restoration was carried out after the war. The interior of the church was renovated in 1991.  Description  Of the original Gothic church, only the choir buttresses and the north wall of the nave remain. The tower (1730) has a lantern dome of characteristic Munich type. The Neo-Baroque facade shows the use of elements borrowed from Viscardi's Trinity Church. The interior is aisled, with an ambulatory round the choir. The nave is barrel- vaulted, with small vaults over the windows. The aisles have groined vaulting. Among several items of art-historical interest in the church are: in the portico, to left and right of the main entrance, parts of a bronze memorial made in 1608 by Hans Krumpper for Duke Ferdinand of Bavaria, Infante of Spain; in the chancel, the high altar by Nikolaus Stuber (1730), with an altarpiece by Ulrich Loth depicting The Effusion of the Holy Ghost (1661) and two flanking figures of angels by Johann Georg Greiff (1729); in the right aisle, a series of wall paintings (1725) by Peter Jacob Horemans illustrating the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; in the Kreuzkapelle, a late Gothic crucifix (1510); and, midway along the left aisle, an altar with an allegedly miraculous image of the Hammerthaler Madonna (15th century).

He debuted in the 1941 movie Ashok Kumar, but gained fame in S. S. Vasan's 1948 magnum opus Chandralekha.  Early life  Ranjan was born Ramanarayana Venkataramana Sarma in Mylapore, Madras in 1918. His family hailed from the town of Srirangam. Ranjan had his schooling in Madras and received an M. Lit degree from Madras University. While studying in college, he participated in a number of stage plays. Coincidentally, an employee of Gemini Studios, Veppattur Kittu was present at one of his plays. Impressed by Ranjan's performance, Kittu suggested his name to P. G. Raghavachari, who cast him in the M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar-starrer Ashok Kumar, in which he played the role of Gautama Buddha. However, Ranjan did not have any dialogues in the film. Following the success of Ashok Kumar, Ranjan was cast in Rishyasringar, in which he played the title role of Rishyasringa. In his early movies, Ranjan was credited as \\"R. Ramani, B. A.\\" The screen name \\"Ranjan\\" was actually bestowed upon him by Jithen Banerjee of Newtone Studios. In the 1940s, Ranjan established a School of Music and Dancing, and edited an art journal entitled Natyam. He was also awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship under the International Art Program sponsored by the Institute of International Education, New York, in 1950-51. Though Ranjan acted in a number of Bollywood movies, especially costume dramas and some social movies in the 1950s, his star faded by the end of the 1950s. He is best known for his roles in Madari, Bahut Din Huwe, Suvarn Sundari, Nishan, Magic Carpet, Chor Chor and Chor Ho To Aisa. His come-back attempt in Tamil movies also flopped without much opportunity to showcase his talents.  Family  His brother R.R. Sarma, an Architect, who graduated from the JJ School of Arts in Mumbai, designed several projects for the TVS and Murugappa Groups and collaborated his wife brother sivakumar with a UN expert for a housing project in Pallikkaranai. R.R. Sarma, whose firm did not continue after his lifetime, clearly articulated what ailed the industry. \\"Designing houses in Madras is back-breaking and frustrating,\\" he'd said. He took all that in his stride and went on to create the grand Madras University centenary auditorium, the stately RBI office, Victoria Technical Institute on Anna Salai and Voluntary Health Services in Taramani.  Death  Ranjan died of cardiac arrest at a New Jersey hotel on 12 September 1983. He was sixty-five years old at that time.

Matrotrophy is a form of maternal care during embryo development.  Vegetal matrotrophy  Some flowering plants supplied the developing embryos for the first stages. The ovule has no stocks and the nutrients are provided by the \\"mother\\". In plants, matrotrophy is considered a critical evolutionary development preceding the origin of embryophytes and therefore essential to the evolution of land plants. Matrotrophy is facilitated by cytological and ultrastructural modifications on one or both sides of the generational junction, a region called the placenta. Specialization of the placental cells pertains further to their cytological and ultrastructural characteristics: the cytoplasm is often dense and rich in lipids, the vacuole is typically reduced but large in Sphagnum, the endoplasmic reticulum extensive, mitochondria numerous and large, chloroplasts numerous, often less differentiated, rich in lipid-filled globuli and sometimes filled with starch.  Animal matrotrophy  It is associated with live birth (viviparity), in which the embryo of an animal is supplied with additional nutrition from the mother (e.g. through an organ such as placenta or other forms of nutrients providing, e.g. ovatrophy). This can be contrasted with strict lecithotrophy as in oviparity, in which the only source of nutrition for the embryo is the yolk originally contained within the egg. While commonly associated with vertebrates and especially mammals, matrotrophy is found in 21 of 34 animal phyla, and is fairly common in 11 of those. It has arisen independently in more than 150 clades within Chordata and in more than 140 clades amongst invertebrates. See also *Pregnancy (fish) References * Goffinet B, Et al. 2009.

It contains about 11 million ratings for about 8500 movies.http://license.umn.edu/technologies/z05173_movielens-database MovieLens was created in 1997 by GroupLens Research, a research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, in order to gather research data on personalized recommendations. History MovieLens was not the first recommender system created by GroupLens. In May 1996, GroupLens formed a commercial venture called Net Perceptions, which served clients that included E! Online and Amazon.com. E! Online used Net Perceptions' services to create the recommendation system for Moviefinder.com, while Amazon.com used the company's technology to form its early recommendation engine for consumer purchases. When another movie recommendation site, eachmovie.org, closed in 1997, the researchers who built it publicly released the anonymous rating data they had collected for other researchers to use. The GroupLens Research team, led by Brent Dahlen and Jon Herlocker, used this data set to jumpstart a new movie recommendation site, which they chose to call MovieLens. Since its inception, MovieLens has become a very visible research platform: its data findings have been featured in a detailed discussion in a New Yorker article by Malcolm Gladwell, as well as a report in a full episode of ABC Nightline. Additionally, MovieLens data has been critical for several research studies, including a collaborative study between Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, and University of Pittsburgh, \\"Using Social Psychology to Motivate Contributions to Online Communities\\". During Spring in 2015, a search for \\"movielens\\" produced 2,750 results in Google Books and 7,580 in Google Scholar.http://files.grouplens.org/papers/harper-tiis2015.pdf Recommendations MovieLens bases its recommendations on input provided by users of the website, such as movie ratings. The site uses a variety of recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering algorithms such as item-item, Sarwar, Badrul, et al. \\"Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms.\\" Proceedings of the 10th international conference on World Wide Web. ACM, 2001. user-user, and regularized SVD. Ekstrand, Michael D. Towards Recommender Engineering Tools and Experiments for Identifying Recommender Differences. Diss. UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, 2014.

Maxwell Harper, and Loren Terveen. \\"Using Groups of Items to Bootstrap New Users in Recommender Systems.\\" Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing. ACM, 2015. The system asks new users to rate how much they enjoy watching various groups of movies (for example, movies with dark humor, versus romantic comedies). The preferences recorded by this survey allow the system to make initial recommendations, even before the user has rated a large number of movies on the website. For each user, MovieLens predicts how the user will rate any given movie on the website. Based on these predicted ratings, the system recommends movies that the user is likely to rate highly. The website suggests that users rate as many fully watched films as possible, so that the recommendations given will be more accurate, since the system would then have a better sample of the user's film tastes. However, MovieLens' rating incentive approach is not always particularly effective, as researchers found more than 20% of the movies listed in the system have so few ratings that the recommender algorithms cannot make accurate predictions about whether subscribers will like them or not. The recommendations on movies cannot contain any marketing values that can tackle the large number of movie ratings as a \\"seed dataset\\". http://license.umn.edu/technologies/z05173_movielens-database In addition to movie recommendations, MovieLens also provides information on individual films, such as the list of actors and directors of each film. Users may also submit and rate tags (a form of metadata, such as \\"based on a book\\", \\"too long\\", or \\"campy\\"), which may be used to increase the film recommendations system's accuracy. The ratings in MovieLens could happen any time, in fact, it could happen years later after watching a movie. Users would often enter numerous ratings at once hoping that they would get more personalized recommendations or just for satisfaction. http://files.grouplens.org/papers/harper-tiis2015.pdf Reception By September 1997, the website had reached over 50,000 users. When the Akron Beacon Journals Paula Schleis tried out the website, she was surprised at how accurate the website was in terms of recommending new films for her to watch based on her film tastes. Outside of the realm of movie recommendations, data from MovieLens has been used by Solution by Simulation to make Oscar predictions. Hickey, Walt. \\"Do Your Oscar Predictions Stack Up? Here's What The Data Says.\\" FiveThirtyEight. N.p., 18 Feb. 2016. Web. 08 Mar. 2016. Research In 2004, a collaborative study with researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota and University of Pittsburgh designed and tested incentives derived from the social psychology principles of social loafing and goal-setting on MovieLens users. The researchers saw that under-contribution seemed to be a problem for the community and set up a study to discern the most effective way to motivate users to rate and review more films. The study executed two field experiments; one involved email messages that reminded users of the uniqueness of their contributions and the benefits that follow from them, and the other gave users a range of individual or group goals for contribution. The first experiment, based on the analysis of the MovieLens community‚Äôs cumulative response, found that users were more likely to contribute to the community when they were reminded of their uniqueness, leading them to think that their contributions are not duplicates of what other users are able to provide. Contrary to the researchers‚Äô hypothesis, they also found that users were less likely to contribute when it was made salient to them the benefit they receive from rating or the benefit others receive when they rate. Lastly, they found no support for the relationship between uniqueness and benefit. The second experiment found that users were also more likely to contribute when they were given specific and challenging goals and were led to believe that their contributions were needed in order to accomplish the group‚Äôs goal. The study found that in this particular context, giving users group-level goals actually increased contributions compared to individual goals, where the researchers predicted that the reverse would be true due to the effects of social loafing. The relationship between goal difficulty and user contributions in both the group and individual cases gave weak evidence that beyond a certain difficulty threshold, performance drops, instead of plateaus as previously hypothesized in Locke and Latham‚Äôs goal-setting theory. Datasets GroupLens Research, a human-computer interaction research lab at the University of Minnesota, provides the rating data sets collected from MovieLens website for research use. The full data set contains 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. It also includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags (Last updated 8/2017). There are many types of research conducted based on the MovieLens data sets. Liu et al. used MovieLens data sets to test the efficiency of an improved random walk algorithm by depressing the influence of large-degree objects.

This term is used to look into the triggers of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease in people with diabetes. The symptoms follow the same progression as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, beginning with difficulty remembering recent events and as the disease progresses, linguistic problems, mood and behavioural swings and motivational loss can also be apparent. The progression from diabetes to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is inadequately understood however there are a number of hypotheses describing the cause, progression and link between the two diseases. The internal mechanism Insulin resistance and other metabolic risk factors such as hyperglycaemia, caused by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are common processes thought to be contributors to the development of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease in diabetics. Diagnosis for this disease is different between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. type 1 diabetes is usually discovered in children and adolescence while type 2 diabetic patients are often diagnosed later in life. While Type 3 diabetes is not a diagnosis in itself, a diagnosis of suspected Alzheimer's Disease can be established through observational signs and sometimes with neuroimaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to observe abnormalities in diabetic patient‚Äôs brain tissue. The techniques used to prevent the disease in patients with diabetes are similar to individuals who do not show signs of the disease. The four pillars of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease prevention is currently used as a guide for individuals of whom are at risk of developing Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Research into the effectiveness of Glucagon- like Peptide 1and Melatonin administration to manage the progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease in diabetic patients is currently being conducted to decrease the rate at which Alzheimer‚Äôs disease progresses. Labelling Alzheimer's disease as Type 3 Diabetes is generally controversial, and this definition is not a known medical diagnosis. While insulin resistance is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease and some other dementias, causes of Alzheimer's disease are likely to be much more complex than being explained by insulin factors on their own, and indeed several patients with Alzheimer's disease have normal insulin metabolism.  Signs and symptoms  The symptoms of the proposed disease are identical to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Overtime an individual will show a progressive pattern of cognitive impairment and decline. The progression of this disease varies from person to person. It‚Äôs the prevalence of symptoms is dependent on when the individual is diagnosed with diabetes. Individuals with type 1 diabetes are often diagnosed at a young age, usually between childhood and adolescence. In some cases, brain development in these patients is negatively impacted, therefore showing symptoms of the disease earlier in life. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes is characteristically seen in patients in their mid-sixties, leading to the prevalence of symptoms later in life. The early stages of the disease are often associated with memory loss however other areas such as loss in judgment and reasoning and spatial and visual issues are often early symptoms of the disease. As the individual ages, symptoms characteristically progress to more severe memory loss, poor judgement in making decisions, mood swings and in some cases patients are more susceptible to anxiety and/ or depression. In the final cases of the disease, severe and more prominent symptoms are shown. In these cases the individual has completely lost their independence and will be reliant on others as their body begins to fail. Inability to communicate, Seizures, weight loss and loss of bowel control are the final symptoms. However in most cases, aspiration pneumonia, ulcers or untreated infections are the cause of death for these patients  Cause  There are a number of mechanisms that attempt to explain the cause, progression and the link between type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease  Insulin resistance  Insulin resistance reduces the body‚Äôs sensitivity to insulin. This is a sign an individual has prediabetes or has progressed to develop type 2 diabetes. The result is high glucose levels in the blood which leave the individual feeling tired and weak in most cases. type 3 diabetes is a condition which can follow after initially being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. In type 3 diabetes, the neurons lack glucose, a key element needed for the neurons to function effectively in body however more specifically the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. This deficiency can lead to a decrease in memory, judgement and the ability to reason, of which are key symptoms of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  Hyperglycemia caused by oxidative stress  The consumption of carbohydrates, fatty (unsaturated) acids, small antioxidant consumption and little exercise are diabetic factors that contribute to oxidative stress within the brain. Oxidative stress is an imbalance of free radicals such as superoxide, hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide radical which can create damage to the cells and tissue in the body. This resulting imbalance leads to a slow decrease in cognition which can be severe in patients in type 2 diabetes.  Lipid peroxidation  type 2 diabetes causes change in patient‚Äôs blood profile which increases the likelihood of the patient‚Äôs cells to experience damage through lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation involves free radicals taking electrons from lipids in the cell membrane, causing cell destruction. This process has been observed in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. One of the main biomarkers of oxidative stress is lipid peroxidation as acids including polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to characteristically associate with free radicals. Therefore lipid peroxidation can cause enhancements in oxidative stress, a main process in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.  Diagnosis  A minor to medium decline in cognitive function is found to be linked with both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. However substantial variances in the cognitive pathophysiology of both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, leading to impairment. type 2 diabetes is characteristically diagnosed from within the late fifties to mid- sixties age range however it is possible to be diagnosed younger. This form of diabetes is typically related to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension and obesity. These mechanisms have a harmful influence on brain development. type 1 diabetes is typically detected at a from a young age and may have negative impacts on cognitive growth. In both forms of diabetes, microvascular complications and hyperglycaemia are mutual risk factors that are found to contribute to the cognitive decline in patients.  Prevention  There is no evidence today supporting a definitive method for preventing the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease in diabetic patients. However the four pillars of Alzheimer‚Äôs prevention which outlines diet, physical and mental exercise, yoga and meditation and psychological well being is recommended to patients whom are at risk.  Diet  Mediterranean diet foods Mediterranean diet, a diet based around fruit, vegetables, olive oil, nuts and seafood has been shown to lower the risks of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease in patients. Specifically, patients who followed this diet which is modeled on particular Mediterranean nations presented decreasing amounts of amyloid-beta plaques between their nerve cells in the brain, signifying the cell connections within the brain were firing correctly. This diet also presented increases in the thickness in the memory division of the brain cortex in the formal and parietal lobes and areas of cognition such as language and memory. Updated versions of the Mediterranean diet such as the DASH diet have been recommended for patients, adding juicing and supplements to the recommendation for patients.  Physical and mental exercise  232x232px Physical exercise increases the amount of blood flow through the brain while simultaneously causing the growth of brain cells known as neurogenesis. One hundred and twenty minutes of aerobic exercise and multiple strength sessions a week are suggested to maintain and increase memory function in the patient. Mental stimulation is also recommended for patients. Brain aerobic activities such as reading and puzzles are endorsed to test and stimulate cognitive functioning while creative activities like painting and viewing art also activate the conditioning of the brain  Yoga and meditation  Mediation and yoga have been found to reduce stress, which is major element in the cause of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Stress has a negative impact on a patient‚Äôs genes such as producing inflammation in the brain, a key component of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. Simple twelve minute meditation each day reduces levels of stress in patients and extends the flow of blood to key areas of the brain responsible for memory performance. Yoga also stimulates the Anterior Cingulate Gyrus, a key area in the brain which manages memory recall, stress, emotive and cognitive stability.  Psychological well being  Psychological well-being factors such as self-acceptance and confidence, personal growth, regular socialization and independence decrease the probability of mental decline and reduce inflammation within the brain. Purpose in Life is now considered to increase the physiological health of patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Optimistic emotions such as love, appreciation and kindness are known to lessen the stress response and maintain a healthy cognition throughout the rest of the patient's life  Management = Melatonin administration  Chemical structure of Melatonin Melatonin is discharged by the Pineal Gland as a neurohormone. Melatonin is a central hormone in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease as it adjusts sleep patterns that are abnormal, which occurs in over forty five percent of patients. Melatonin affects type 3 diabetes by reducing harm caused by beta amyloid, regulating hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance in patients with diabetes and stopping blood brain barrier disruption caused by hyperglycaemia. Through these processes, melatonin has been shown to lessen the progression of type 3 diabetes.  Glucagon-like Peptide 1 administration  The administration of the hormone Glucagon-like Peptide 1 has shown to control the deregulation of glucose metabolism in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. This hormone can recover cerebral dysfunction in diabetes induced Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The hormone Glucagon-like Peptide 1 can lessen the brain‚Äôs inflamed reaction caused by amyloid beta oxidative stress. Glucagon-like Peptide 1 can also increase the rate of neurogenesis within the brains of Alzheimer‚Äôs patients. Glucagon-like Peptide 1 has the possibility to increase the production of neurons to substitute impaired neurons within the brain. This hormone can also decrease the brain‚Äôs insulin resistance in Alzheimer‚Äôs patients.

The confirmed track listing was released on the Victory Records website. Guitarist Mike DeWolf described the album's sound as a return to the heavy nature of Taproot's early material: :\\"We're definitely making it as heavy as possible and aggressive while still keeping a lot of the beautiful melodies and just the general beauty of things in it. We're using a lot more of our baritone guitars, which was sort of the signature of the Gift and Welcome [2002] years, so that immediately makes things a lot heavier.\\"TAPROOT's 'Plead The Fifth' Pushed Back To May RoadrunnerRecords.com (March 5, 2010). The album debuted at number 107 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 5,500. Critical reception Corey Hoffy of AbsolutePunk said that despite not coming close to Blue-Sky Research, he commended the band for returning to their heavier roots from their earlier work while maintaining a modicum of melodies, concluding that \\"Overall, I was impressed with the musical approach and the vocal approach the band took. The downfall (of us all?) though lies in its lack of creativity and typical lyrics. Even with all of its faults though, the band seems to be having more fun than ever, and it's easy to tell that after five studio releases, this band is finally going to go places.\\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said of the record, \\"It‚Äôs a bunch of twists and turns in search of a song, and if Taproot doesn‚Äôt necessarily find melodic through- lines, they nevertheless know how to construct vehicles for their flair, which is darker and heavier than it has been in some time ‚Äì and that may be enough to please the hardcore who have been dismayed by the band‚Äôs ambition of late.\\" Tim Grierson of About.com felt the band's return to a more straightforward sound was a misstep that resulted in tracks sounding too alike to each other, despite Stephen Richards remaining a vocal presence behind tracks like \\"No View Is True\\" and \\"Release Me\\".

Their style consists of a combination of melodic death and black metal with influences from other styles of metal like heavy, thrash, speed and classical music. History The Bulgarian symphonic progressive/black metal band Claymore was formed in the summer of 1999 in the city of Ruse. Founding members are Kamen Manev (drums), Martin Manev (guitar). Choosing the keyboard was complex and after three months of auditions Tsvetelin Baltov was chosen for keyboards: he became one of the pillars of Claymore. After a number of changes over the years, the current staff is: Martin - guitar; Kamen - drums; Tsvetelin - keyboards, Emil - vocals and bass. Claymore quickly became popular among Bulgarian fans with unique and pure style of symphonic progressive/black metal combining aggression and melody in one with influences from other styles like heavy, thrash, death, grind, pagan as well as a good amount of classical music. Their first ever performance is in September 1999 to start a long tour in many cities across Bulgaria . This earns them a place at the biggest Bulgarian Underground Music Festival (Bourgas 2000). At the end of 2000 Claymore recorded their first demo tracks quickly followed by a demo CD titled \\"Warriors of Claymore\\" which is posted on many web magazines and played on radio shows in Bulgaria and abroad. During 2002 Claymore worked hard on the sound quality for the recording of the actual demo \\"Released\\" consisting of 5 songs. These songs represent their style and part of their live shows. Claymore's remarkable popularity and success earns them a place in \\"Trash till Death 2005,2006\\", \\"Heatework festival 2006\\", \\"Heart Rock festival 2008\\", \\"Black Curs Fest 2008\\", \\"Legacy Open Air Fest 2009\\", \\"Barock Fest 2009\\", \\"Ost festival 2012\\", \\"Sea Black Festival 2013\\", \\"Urpin Fest 2014\\" etc., where they played alongside well-known international bands like Destruction, Dimmu Borgir, Primordial, Napalm Death, Sinister, Lord Belial, Graveworm, Eastern Front, Exumer, Negura Bunget, Izegrim, Spoil Engine, Zombie INC, etc. Claymore recorded their first full-length album Prolonged Active Antagonism and took part in \\"Black Curse Over Europe\\" tour in 2008. The album is out on D.O.P. (Bulgaria). Official mp3 distributors are Forces of Satan (Norway), Toxicity Records ‚Äì Vodafone Live (Bulgaria).

The mill has been restored to working order. It is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 8530. History Drainage of the Huinserpolder started in 1828, initially by five windmills. These were replaced by De Huinsermolen, which was built by millwright Lieuwe Johannes van der Meulen of Leeuwarden in 1829. In 1937, plans were made to replace De Huinsermolen with a mechanical pump, but these plans were not carried through, mainly due to opposition from then miller Cees Hoitsma. A three-cylinder Lister diesel engine was placed in the mill in 1958, working in conjunction with the windmill. The mill was restored between 1978 and 1980 by millwright Dijkstra of Giekerk. The work included rethatching the mill and new Patent sails. In 1995, the mill was owned by Waterschap De Middels√©krite, Sneek, but it is now owned by Wetterskap Frysl√¢n. A new pumping station was built alongside the mill in 2001. The mill is kept in working order and is used regularly. Description De Huinsermolen is what the Dutch describe as an grondzeiler. It is a three- storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to the ground. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The smock and cap are thatched. The sails are Patent sails. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast in 1877 by Prins van Oranje, 's Gravenhage, Zuid Holland. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 55 cogs. This drives the wallower (31 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel, which has 44 cogs drives a gearwheel with 40 cogs on the axle of the Archimedes' screw. The axle of the Archimedes' screw is diameter.

Life Friedrich Josef Rauch was born in Munich in 1906, the son of s senior police inspector.Ian Sayer & Douglas Botting, Nazi Gold (Granada Publishing, 1984), p.16. At the age of 15, whilst still at school, he joined a right wing paramilitary Freikorps unit and in 1922 joined the NSDAP. He was involved in the attempted Nazi Beer Hall Putsch and in 1923 was one of the first recipients of the Blutorden award (Blood Order). He later joined the SA and gained employment in the Bavarian police. His career was accelerated by the Nazi assumption of power in 1933. Six foot tall, upright in bearing, an outdoor type without suspect intellectual pretensions, a keen and accomplished horse rider, skier and mountaineer with all the right political and nationalistic views, Friedrich Rauch was just the kind of man the New Order welcomed to its ranks. He was promoted to inspector, then to captain in the Security Police, and in 1940 he was seconded to Berlin for security duties on the staff of the Head of the Reich Chancellery, Dr Lammers.Ian Sayer & Douglas Botting, Nazi Gold (Granada Publishing, 1984), p.17. In 1940 he was admitted into the Allgemeine SS with rank as an SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. In December that year he volunteered to leave the office and served in the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, seeing action in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Yugoslavia. In July 1941 Rauch returned to work under SS Obergruppenf√ºhrer Dr. Hans Lammers in Berlin. The annex of the Old Reich Chancellery, August 1938 Early in 1942 Rauch was appointed SS Sturmbannf√ºhrer of the Schutzpolizei (Major in the Security Police) and by Spring 1944 he was promoted to SS Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (Lieutenant Colonel). This promotion was ratified and signed by both Hitler and Himmler. On 9 April 1945, with the Red Army rapidly approaching, Dr Lammers persuaded Hitler to relocate the Reichsbank gold bullion, currency reserves and other wealth, to a safer location in southern Germany. Rauch was posted to ensure security. On 14 April, when the Reichsbank loot was transported on trains, Rauch flew down to the Berchtesgaden, where he obtained papers discharging him from further service. Over 21‚Äì22 April Rauch escorted the treasure to the Kaserne (barracks) of the Wehrmacht Gebirgsj√§gerschule (mountain troops school) in Mittenwald, Bavaria. Rauch left the gold with a Wehrmacht Colonel named Franz Pfeiffer with vague instructions to protect it from foreign armies. SS Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Rauch surrendered to US troops in June 1945 but was soon released under curious circumstances after helping US military personnel locate much of the loot, which was never properly processed to the appropriate US military financial authorities. According to SHAEF regulations, Rauch should have been automatically arrested due to his SS rank, but he was not interned until 27 November when a special Counter Intelligence Corps agent seized and interrogated him at Tegernsee city jail. Rauch was then, inexplicably, transferred to a Civilian Enclosure at Stephanskirchen and released the following year. In February 1948 Rauch and his wife emigrated to Argentina with the direct help of the Croatian Roman Catholic priest Krunoslav Draganoviƒá,Uki Goni, The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Peron's Argentina (Granta Books, 2002), p.248. where he became Jos√© Federico Rauch. Rauch soon \\"became a partner in a metallurgical firm by the name of Exact SCL, a company formed by Germans and based at Santa Rosa\\"Ian Sayer & Douglas Botting, Nazi Gold (Granada Publishing, 1984), p.213. in Buenos Aires. Curiously Franz Pfeiffer later emigrated also to Argentina and is understood to have joined the company board of directors. Rauch returned to Europe and settled in Austria at the early 1970s where he died in the 1990s.

Overview  By inspecting network traffic passively, p0f can attempt to identify the operating systems on remote machines that send TCP packets to the detecting machine's network interface, or to a physical subnet that the detecting machine can listen on. Since version 3, p0f is also able to deduce aspects of the remote system by inspecting application-level HTTP messages. p0f can also check for firewall presence. It can estimate the distance to a remote system and calculate its uptime. It also guesses the remote system's means of connecting to the network (DSL, OC3, etc.). Unlike tools like nmap, p0f does not generate traffic. Instead, it determines the operating system of the remote host by analyzing certain fields in the captured packets. This can have benefits in environments where actively creating network traffic would cause unhelpful side effects. In particular, the remote system will not be able to detect the packet capture and inspection.  Usage  Signatures used for packet inspection are stored in a simple text file. This allows them to be modified without recompiling p0f. The user is allowed to use a different fingerprinting file by selecting another one at run time. p0f does not have a graphical user interface.

It aired in the United States on NBC on October 1, 2009. The episode sees Jeff attempt to \\"seize the day\\" to pass a class, while Britta pays for Abed to take a filmmaking class, to his dad's annoyance. It received mixed critical reviews and garnered 5.86 million viewers upon its premiere.  Plot  Jeff (Joel McHale) convinces the rest of the study group to enroll in an easy class, taught by the eccentric Professor Whitman (John Michael Higgins). Whitman claims that they will all get 'A' grades as long as they follow the mantra carpe diem. He confronts Jeff after the class, saying that he is an opportunist and will fail the class unless he seizes the day by the end of the week. Jeff's initial attempts to impress Whitman by wearing rainbow-colored suspenders, flying a kite and playing jump rope fail. Meanwhile, Abed (Danny Pudi) is unable to join the class as his father Gobi (Iqbal Theba) will only pay for classes which teach skills that can help him with the family's failing falafel stand. Britta (Gillian Jacobs) gives Abed money to enroll in filmmaking classes, an interest of his. Abed purchases a new camera and starts to document conversations with the study group, casting Britta as his mother and Jeff as his father, to their dismay. Gobi accosts Britta for interfering with his parenting. Britta and Jeff explain their problems to each other, and Jeff promises that he will convince Gobi to meet with them to discuss Abed's future. As Abed works on his computer, Gobi, Jeff, and Britta get into an argument, but Abed interrupts them with his completed video. He has used his footage of Jeff and Britta arguing, superimposing the images of his parents' heads onto their bodies; the film is cut to recast the study group's conversations as Abed's parents' opinions of him, as an abnormal child who refuses to let his parents parent him. The film implies that Abed's parents divorced because of his atypical behavior. Gobi finds the film emotionally heartening, and allows Abed to continue his filmmaking studies to help him be better understood. Thankful for Jeff's help, Britta kisses him when she sees Whitman nearby. An enthused Whitman is satisfied that Jeff has seized the day. In the end tag, Abed attempts krumping in front of Troy, who then begins to demonstrate his method of krumping. Jeff arrives and asks what they are doing, the pair feeling foolish. Jeff then attempts his own krump and the three krump together.  Analysis  John Michael Higgins as Professor Whitman references the 1989 American teen drama film Dead Poets Society.  Reception  Upon its first broadcast in the United States, an estimated 5.86 million viewers watched the episode. Jonah Krakow of IGN rated the episode eight out of ten, praising Jeff's storyline as amusing and Abed's documentary as \\"surprisingly poignant\\". Krakow reviewed that Chase's visual gags served to make \\"great use of his limited screentime\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating, criticising its messages as \\"heavy-handed\\". However, she praised Troy and Pierce's interactions, and wrote that Abed's storyline served to \\"deepen a character who could have turned out to be just a stereotype\\". VanDerWerff approved of the \\"queasily hilarious\\" video that Abed produces, which made \\"a surprisingly moving end\\" to the episode. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic found that the episode demonstrated that the series can \\"tug at your emotional strings\\" as well as provide comedy. Entertainment Weeklys John Young gave the episode a middling review, believing that Higgins' performance was funny but calling Abed \\"so awkwardly antisocial that he's no longer amusing\\".

The film was produced by Tsui Hark, directed by Ching Siu-tung, and starred Brigitte Lin, Joey Wong and Yu Rongguang. The film is regarded as a sequel to The Swordsman and Swordsman II. Plot Following Dongfang Bubai's apparent death in Swordsman II, the jianghu (martial artists' community) disintegrates into chaos as it lacks a dominant figure to serve as a de facto leader. Several imposters use Dongfang Bubai's name to rally supporters, form their own sects, and fight for power. One of Dongfang Bubai's devoted lovers, Xue Qianxun, rebuilds the Sun Moon Holy Cult by impersonating Dongfang Bubai. The Ming imperial court sends a naval admiral, Gu Changfeng, to assist the Spanish in searching for the remains of a Dutch warship sunk near Black Woods Cliff, the site of Dongfang Bubai's death in Swordsman II. At Black Woods Cliff, Gu Changfeng discovers that Dongfang Bubai is still alive in disguise as an elderly woman, and manages to convince him to return to the jianghu. Dongfang Bubai unleashes his fury and starts a bloodbath in eliminating all those who impersonate him. He discovers that Xue Qianxun has been pretending to be him, and seriously injures her in anger. Consumed by his desire for power, Dongfang Bubai decides to continue his ambitious plan to unite the jianghu under his rule and dominate China. Gu Changfeng realises that Dongfang Bubai has gone out of control so he leads the Ming imperial navy to fight Dongfang and his Spanish and Japanese allies. In the ensuing naval battle, all the warships are destroyed and Dongfang Bubai emerges victorious after defeating and killing Gu Changfeng. However, Xue Qianxun loses her life in the process. Dongfang Bubai realises his mistake and embraces his dead lover as he retires from the jianghu again.

Biography Jill Hellyer was born in 1925 in Sydney, Australia, to parents Harold and Ruby. Her father died when Jill was a child, followed by her elder brother Allan, who died of a chronic illness in his teenage years. Jill's mother, Ruby, was diagnosed with leukaemia and died when Jill was 12. Jill was sent to live with two unmarried aunts in the Sydney suburb of Seaforth, who raised her until adulthood and inspired several of her better- known poems, including \\"Living With Aunts\\", which is included in The Puncher and Wattman anthology of Australian Poetry. (2010) She attended North Sydney Girls High School. An avid writer throughout her life, Jill Hellyer was a consistent contributor of poetry and prose to literary magazines such as Southerly, Overland, Meanjin and Heat. She helped to establish the Australian Society of Authors and was its foundation secretary from 1963 to 1971. She was subsequently made a life member for her services. In 2006 she was awarded an OAM for that work and her contribution to Australian poetry. She published three collections of verse and a novel, as well as editing a biography and compiling a collection of satirical epitaphs. Hellyer raised three children, two of whom had significant disabilities. She had six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. She died in Goulburn on 27 December 2012.

Themes Hellyer's work was highly influenced by her upbringing and adult life in Australia. Many of her poems centred around Australian history (The Last Song of Edward Kelly, The Ballad of Elinor Magee) or native landscape and wildlife (Song of the Humpback Whales, Dingo, Manly Pines). Others offered poignant portraits of Australian life (O'Regan's Bride, Miss Petty's Sunlight). However, Hellyer's most enduring and engaging work related to her subjective experiences of love, loss, and intensely felt details of everyday life (Alone, Living with Aunts, Young Girl Awakening, The Exile).

Electricity production In 2015, the total of electricity production reaches 117 TWh, of which 64% comes from hydro, 19% from gas and 17% from oil. Losses however are uncommonly high, reaching 34% of production. In 2015, Venezuela produced 75 TWh of hydropower, which accounts 1.9% of world's total, a small increase over the production of 2004 of 70 TWh . The installed capacity had however in 2012 reached 26 GW from a total of 13.76 GW at the end of 2002, where 4.5 GW were under construction and 7.4 GW planned. The World Energy Council energy resource report of 2010 estimates the gross theoretical hydropower production could reach 731 TWh per annum, of which 100 TWh are economically exploitable, an increase over the 320 TWh estimates of 2004. Hydroelectricity production is concentrated on the Caron√≠ River in Guayana Region. Today it has 4 different dams. The largest hydroplant is the Guri dam with 10,200 MW of installed capacity, which makes it the third-largest hydroelectric plant in the world. Other hydroelectric projects on the Caron√≠ are Caruachi Dam, Macagua I, Macagua II and Macagua III, with a total of 15.910 MW of installed capacity in 2003. A new dams, Tocoma (2 160 MW) and Tayucay (2 450 MW), was under construction between Guri and Caruachi in 2003. With a projected installed capacity for the whole Hydroelectric Complex (upstream Caroni River and downstream Caroni River), between 17.250 and 20.000 MW were planned for 2010. Organizations The largest power companies are state-owned CVG (EDELCA), a subsidiary of the mining company Corporaci√≥n Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), and Compania Anonima de Administracion y Fomento Electrico () accounting respectively for approximately 63% and 18% of generating capacities. Other state-owned power companies are (ENELBAR) and (ENELVEN) and Energ√≠a El√©ctrica de la Costa Oriental (ENELCO) or ENELVEN- ENELCO (approximately 8% of capacities).

It was in circulation between 2006 and 2013. Appearance, production and distribution KUNST Magazin was published ten times a year (with double issues in Jul./Aug. and Dec./Jan.). It was bilingual, German/English, and had a monthly print run of 40,000 copies. It was published in Germany, German-speaking Switzerland and Austria. During the first four years of publication, KUNST Magazin Berlin applied almost solely to Berlin, and distribution was also primarily in Berlin. From January 2010 the magazine was named KUNST Magazin¬¥. Until February 2007, KUNST Magazin appeared in DIN A6 format; from the March 2007 issue, the magazine was published in DIN A5 format. The magazine was self-distributed in hotels, galleries, museums and academies. Art experts and collectors, as well as persons in culture, the media and politics, with an affinity for art, receive KUNST Magazin by mail. History KUNST Magazin was founded in Berlin in April 2006 by Jennifer Becker, as KUNST Magazin Berlin. It ended publication in 2013. Content and Issues About 50 percent of KUNST Magazin consisted of editorial contributions, such as articles, interviews with artists and collectors, book reviews, and a page for children. The remainder listed current exhibitions. From 2007 each edition focussed on one main topic. There were, for example, taboo (03/08), dignity (02/09) and vision (02/10). From February 2010 each edition also featured one gallery. Towards the end detailed exhibition tips could be found. The print edition was supplemented by the bilingual homepage www.kunst-magazin.de, which had a daily calendar of current exhibitions and the entire contents of KUNST Magazin. All published editions were accessible in the site archive and almost every edition was available as a PDF-Download. Events From January 2010 KUNST Magazin presented and organised a monthly meeting in Berlin at which art collectors made themselves available to the public for a moderated discussion and questions. Previous guests in this series were Giovanna Stefanel-Stoffel and Maximilian Stoffel (January 2010), Thomas Rusche (February 2010), Ivo Wessel (March 2010), Thomas Olbricht (April 2010, Stefan Balzer (May 2010), Tommi Brem (June 2010) and Christiane zu Salm (July 2010). These conversations with collectors were moderated by Jan Kage.

He is a member of the Team Titans, a rebel group seeking to overthrow Lord Chaos, the dictator of an alternate Earth ten years into the future. Fictional character biography David was an ordinary mortal boy growing up in London. When he was ten, he was hit by a truck. Lord Chaos took a special interest in him, making him a test subject. At fourteen, he was the subject of an experiment in which he was infused with DNA drawn from the bones of Dracula. This turned him into a blood-hungering monster he dubbed \\"Dagon\\", because he felt as if David, the person he used to be, was dead. During the experiment, a demon attacked the research team; Dagon joined it and singled out the chief researcher for special attention. The only survivor was Charlie Watkins, who would later become the hero Killowat. Dagon joined the Team Titans to get revenge on Lord Chaos, adopting the name Nightrider. They taught him how to control his hunger and assigned him to a team. Nightrider and his teammates Killowat (Charlie Watkins), Terra (Tara Markov), Mirage (Miriam Delgado),and Redwing (Carrie Levine) were selected by the leader of Team Titans to be sent back in time. They were later followed by Nightwing (Dick Grayson) and Battalion (Alexander Lyons). Their mission was to kill Wonder Girl (Donna Troy) before she could give birth to Lord Chaos. The Teamers and the Titans fought, but they resolved the conflict in a way that stopped Lord Chaos and protected Donna Troy and her baby. However, this left the Teamers trapped in the present with no way to return to their now non-existent future. Dagon later sought out his past self and prevented David from being hit by the truck. Zero Hour The paradox induced by their travel to the past was apparently part of the time crisis known as Zero Hour. It was revealed that the real tyrant, the Monarch, had created the members of Team Titans 36 years in the future in 2030 AD. The Monarch then brainwashed them with false memories. He then sent them to the past so he could use them to further his goals and assassinate anyone who tried to stop him. After the resolution of Zero Hour, most of the Team Titans characters ceased to exist. Only Terra, Mirage and Deathwing survived. The Time Trapper had created them to infiltrate Team Titans as his sleeper agents that would help him fight the Monarch when the time came. Later it was revealed that they were doubles who were surgically altered to resemble the real Tara Markov, Miriam Delgado, and Dick Grayson. Other versions *In Team Titans Annual #2 (1994), Dagon works with Terra as a rebel cell in deep space after Lord Chaos conquers much of the galaxy. *In the story Wrong Place, Wrong Time in Teen Titans Go! #48 (December, 2007), the alternate-world-hopping Teen Titans encounter the Team Titans, which are led by \\"Nightwing\\" (Dagon).

All Members are represented in the International Cocoa Council, the highest governing body of the ICCO. The two most important breakthroughs of the present International Cocoa Agreement were the establishment of an explicit mandate on a Sustainable World Cocoa Economy and the founding of the Consultative Board on the World Cocoa Economy. The Consultative Board consists of fourteen international experts in the cocoa sector, all from the private sector (seven from cocoa producing Member countries and seven from cocoa consuming Member countries). However, the Board, whose mandate is as extensive as that of the International Cocoa Council and comprises all aspects of the world cocoa economy, only functions in an advisory capacity, as all final decisions are taken by the International Cocoa Council.

The plot builds on the depowering of Bruce Banner by Red Hulk during the \\"Dark Reign\\" storyline and the betrayal of Doc Samson who joined with the Intelligencia to bring about the \\"Fall of the Hulks\\" to create an army of Hulks to take over the world. \\"World War Hulks\\" also shows the origins of Red Hulk (Thunderbolt Ross) and Red She-Hulk (Betty Ross). \\"World War Hulks\\" is the continuation of an arc that began with the Planet Hulk storyline in 2006‚Äì07, that continued into World War Hulk (the Marvel event of 2007), through the short lived Skaar: Son of Hulk and into the last two years of both Hulk titles, which have largely focused on the identity of Red Hulk, the depowering of Bruce Banner, and the arrival of Skaar on Earth. The newly announced \\"Incredible Hulks: Dark Son\\", which brings Skaar's brother Hiro-Kala to Earth, is the end of the arc. Publication history The series started with a one shot called World War Hulks, and ran through the series Hulk and Incredible Hulk; it also included some \\"Fall of the Hulks\\" titles, two issues of Hulked-Out Heroes and two special World War Hulks, Captain America Vs. Wolverine and Spider-Man vs Thor. Also, Hulked Out Heroes revealed the names of the Hulkified versions of those that were turned into Hulks. The series revealed the identities of both Red Hulk and Red She-Hulk and how they came to be that way. Additionally the series brought back Bruce Banner as the Hulk and set up the fight with his father that Skaar has been longing for. Plot summary Ulik resurfaces and is shown to have gone on a multi-state drinking binge. He ends up destroying a train bridge with the disaster being averted by A-Bomb and Marlo Chandler. When Ulik starts choking Marlo, he is defeated by A-Bomb.World War Hulks #1 While in a fantasy world where Bruce killed the Hulk and the smart heroes joined the smart villains in a machine to help the world and where General Thunderbolt Ross is still alive, Bruce is visited by Doctor Doom who gives him a robot arm. Back at his home (with his imaginary family which consists of Betty Ross, a son, and a daughter), he activates it and wakes up for a moment. He is quickly interrupted by his fantasy son. While playing with his fantasy family, Doctor Doom arrives. Doctor Doom harms his son that then transforms into Skaar forcing Banner to activate the arm and get himself and Doctor Doom back to reality. Meanwhile, Glenn Talbot sends the army to fight the marines that were taking Washington. They receive back up from Skaar, Korg and A-Bomb. The fight continues until the Hulked-Out-Heroes arrive and attack them. Rick says they must find Banner so Skaar launches them to the Hellicarrier where Banner is captive while staying behind to fight Hulked-Out-Heroes consisting of Hulkified versions of Captain America, Thor (referred to as The Mighty Thor), Ms. Marvel, Cyclops (referred to as Hulklops), Iceman (referred to as Icehulk), Storm, Human Torch (referred to as the Hulking Torch), Invisible Woman, and Thing (referred to as No-Thing). Now awake, Banner sees Doctor Doom trying to steal the brains of the smart heroes, since he and the others, including Banner, were still connected to the machine. However, Doom accidentally blows his own brain before being launched off the Intelligencia Helicarrier by Red-She-Hulk. Rick and Skaar then arrive and Skaar stabs Red- She-Hulk with his sword forcing her to revert to her human form revealing her true identity as Betty Ross.Incredible Hulk #609 Meanwhile, Red Hulk fight the Hulked-Out-Heroes constantly using their powers against themselves until using Hulklops' power to damage the Helicarrier and then escaping briefly seeing a still trapped Banner until being attacked by the Hulkfied versions of Spider- Man (referred to as Spider-Hulk) and Wolverine (referred to as Wolverage) but beats them with a fastball special. Red-She-Hulk arrives and drains the energy from Red Hulk's body reverting him to General Thunderbolt Ross who quotes \\"I was General Thunderbolt Ross. I became the very thing I hated most in life. I am the Red Hulk. And for all I've done...I deserve to die...\\" Meanwhile, Samson tells MODOK and Leader that transforming the heroes into Hulks was not a good idea. He then deduces Leader has feelings for Red She-Hulk. Samson then attacks Leader, but is beaten by MODOK.Hulk vol. 2 #22 With Red She-Hulk's identity exposed, Betty begs for Bruce to kill her, explaining that she was resurrected by the Intelligencia into an uncontrollable mutation. Although she is willing to die, the appearance of Samson (who was involved in her mutation) inspires enough rage in her that she transforms once again, engaging Samson while Banner and Skaar are contacted by the mutated Amadeus Cho who like the Leader has acquired a mutated mind rather than a mutated body. Using Cho's gamma-enhanced intellect, Banner realises that the Hulked-Out Heroes joined by a Hulkified version of Namor (referred to as Hulkmariner) will 'burn out' within twenty-four hours unless the radiation is removed from them. While Amadeus Cho keeps the Intelligencia occupied (even reverting M.O.D.O.K. to his human form during the fight), Banner releases Beast, Mister Fantastic, Black Panther and Henry Pym to help him re-tool the Cathexis Ray Generator so that he can draw the gamma energy out of the heroes. Unfortunately, it is only after he has activated the machine that Banner reveals that he is transferring the gamma energy into himself as he is the only person capable of physically handling that much power. However, at a crucial juncture, the machinery begins to break down from the feedback. Samson steps in and absorbs the additional excess energy, but for unknown reasons his body is unable to absorb the energy as readily as Banner's body can and he is killed by the overload, reduced to a charred skeleton in seconds. As his body finishes absorbing the excess radiation, Bruce transforms back into the Hulk as the Intelligencia's base is destroyed, Skaar being clearly satisfied at this new chance to kill his father.Incredible Hulks #610 General Ross then reviews all of his life and then proceeds to absorb energy from the Cosmic Hulk (who had arrived to attack him) and angrily splits him in two. As Red Hulk, General Ross then attacks The Leader, who had just escaped from Banner and takes the gamma energy out of him, leaving him to suffer for the rest of his life being \\"Ordinary\\". Red Hulk then goes to the White House and kills the Glenn Talbot L.M.D. and declares he is in charge quoting \\"I always suspected that Talbot was an L.M.D. Like with the Ross L.M.D., the Leader wasn't going to let anyone assume command other than himself. This Talbot probably didn't even know he was just a thing. The Glenn Talbot I knew and respected was and will remain dead. In the end, everything is as it should be. I won.\\"Hulk vol. 2 #23 Bruce Banner leaves a video for the heroes telling them how he planned all of these and to allow Skaar to kill him besides saving the civilians. Skaar absorbs energy from the planet (even through the heroes try to stop it) and uses it to attack the Hulk. However, the Hulk decides not to fight him claiming he is not here to fight him, but Skaar then says how Caiera was alive in Sakaar till he allowed Galactus to consume it. This ended up angering the Hulk prompting him to continue the fight. During the fight, Red She-Hulk attacks Skaar and tells Hulk to run but he doesn't. Skaar defeats Red She-Hulk knocking her into a building which is about to collapse on Red She Hulk's impact. Hulk then saves the civilians in the building with a thunder clap kicking up sand to stop the building from collapsing. Hulk and Skaar then continue their fight where Hulk beats Skaar into submission. Skaar realizes that Hulk isn't a monster (something Bruce was training him to kill) after saving the people in the building and tells him they'll work it out. Realising that continuing their struggle to kill the perceived 'monster' that is his son would accomplish nothing except turning him into his father, Bruce returns to human form, and he and Skaar (in his child version) then hug.Incredible Hulks #611 Bruce then transforms into Hulk, fully controlling it, and goes back to Washington to battle Red Hulk. Red She-Hulk tries to stop it, but is defeated by She-Hulk. Banner's battle with Red Hulk gets them to the Intelligencia who manage to escape as their battle continues. Their battle eventually ends with Hulk defeating Red Hulk at The Lincoln Memorial, Hulk refusing to kill Red Hulk because of his relationship to Betty even as he informs his adversary that Ross's faked death means that he can never return to his human life now. Later, Banner and Captain Steve Rogers lock Red Hulk up and makes it clear that, given his strength being second to that of the Hulk and his exceptional tactical expertise, they have plans for him.Hulk vol. 2 #24 Bibliography * Hulk vol. 2 #22‚Äì24 * Incredible Hulk #609‚Äì611 * World War Hulks #1 * World War Hulks Hulked-Out Heroes #1‚Äì2 * World War Hulks Spider-Man vs. Thor #1‚Äì2 * World War Hulks Captain America Vs.

The cutaway shows the fabric belts that carry charge up to the mushroom-shaped high voltage electrode. To improve insulation the machine was enclosed in a 65 ft. pressure vessel which was pressurized to 120 psi during operation. The high pressure air increased the voltage on the machine from 1 MV to 5 MV. 750 keV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator initial stage of the KEK accelerator in Tsukuba, Japan. The high voltage generator is right, the ion source and beam tube is at left An electrostatic particle accelerator is one of the two main types of particle accelerators, in which charged particles are accelerated to a high energy by passing through a static high voltage potential. This contrasts with the other category of particle accelerator, oscillating field particle accelerators, in which the particles are accelerated by passing successively through multiple voltage drops created by oscillating voltages on electrodes. Owing to their simpler design, historically electrostatic types were the first particle accelerators. The two main types are the Van de Graaf generator invented by Robert Van de Graaff in 1929, and the Cockcroft-Walton accelerator invented by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton in 1932. The maximum particle energy produced by electrostatic accelerators is limited by the accelerating voltage on the machine, which is limited by insulation breakdown to a few megavolts. Oscillating accelerators do not have this limitation, so they can achieve higher particle energies than electrostatic machines. However, these machines have advantages such as lower cost, the ability to produce continuous beams and higher beam currents that make them useful to industry, so they are by far the most widely used particle accelerators. They are used in industrial irradiating applications such as plastic shrink wrap production, high power X-ray machines, radiation therapy in medicine, radioisotope production, ion implanters in semiconductor production, and sterilization. Many universities worldwide have electrostatic accelerators for research purposes. More powerful accelerators usually incorporate an electrostatic machine as their first stage, to accelerate particles to a high enough velocity to inject into the main accelerator. Electrostatic accelerators are occasionally confused with linear accelerators (linacs) simply because they both accelerate particles in a straight line. The difference between them is that an electrostatic accelerator accelerates a charged particle by passing it through a single DC potential difference between two electrodes, while a linear accelerator accelerates a particle by passing it successively through multiple voltage drops created between multiple accelerating electrodes with an oscillating voltage.  Details  Although these machines accelerate atomic nuclei, the scope of application is not limited to the nuclear sciences of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics and nuclear chemistry. Indeed, those applications are outweighed by other uses of nuclear beams. Of the approximately 26,000 accelerators worldwide, ~44% are for radiotherapy, ~41% for ion implantation, ~9% for industrial processing and research, ~4% for biomedical and other low-energy research (less than 1% are higher energy machines).According to William Barletta, director of USPAS, the US Particle Accelerator School, per Toni Feder, in Physics Today February 2010, \\"Accelerator school travels university circuit\\", p. 20 These accelerators are being used for nuclear medicine in medical physics, sample analysis using techniques such as PIXE in the material sciences, depth profiling in solid state physics, and to a lesser extent secondary ion mass spectrometry in geologic and cosmochemical works, and even neutron beams can be made from the charged particles emerging from these accelerators to perform neutron crystallography in condensed matter physics. The principles used in electrostatic nuclear accelerators could be used to accelerate any charged particles, but particle physics operates at much higher energy regimes than these machines can achieve, and there are various better methods suited for making electron beams, so these accelerators are used for accelerating nuclei.  Single-ended machines  Using a high voltage terminal kept at a static potential on the order of millions of volts, charged particles can be accelerated. In simple language, an electrostatic generator is basically a giant capacitor (although lacking plates). The high voltage is achieved either using the methods of Cockcroft & Walton or Van de Graaff, with the accelerators often being named after these inventors. Van de Graaff's original design places electrons on an insulating sheet, or belt, with a metal comb, and then the sheet physically transports the immobilized electrons to the terminal. Although at high voltage, the terminal is a conductor, and there is a corresponding comb inside the conductor which can pick up the electrons off the sheet; owing to Gauss's law, there is no electric field inside a conductor, so the electrons are not repulsed by the platform once they are inside. The belt is similar in style to a conventional conveyor belt, with one major exception: it is seamless. Thus, if the belt is broken, the accelerator must be disassembled to some degree in order to replace the belt, which, owing to its constant rotation and being made typically of a rubber, is not a particularly uncommon occurrence. The practical difficulty with belts led to a different medium for physically transporting the charges: a chain of pellets. Unlike a normal chain, this one is non-conducting from one end to the other, as both insulators and conductors are used in its construction. These types of accelerators are usually called Pelletrons. Once the platform can be electrically charged by one of the above means, some source of positive ions is placed on the platform at the end of the beam line, which is why it's called the terminal. However, as the ion source is kept at a high potential, one cannot access the ion source for control or maintenance directly. Thus, methods such as plastic rods connected to various levers inside the terminal can branch out and be toggled remotely. Omitting practical problems, if the platform is positively charged, it will repel the ions of the same electric polarity, accelerating them. As E=qV, where E is the emerging energy, q is the ionic charge, and V is the terminal voltage, the maximum energy of particles accelerated in this manner is practically limited by the discharge limit of the high voltage platform, about 12 MV under ambient atmospheric conditions. This limit can be increased, for example, by keeping the HV platform in a tank of an insulating gas with a higher dielectric constant than air, such as SF6 which has dielectric constant roughly 2.5 times that of air. However, even in a tank of SF6 the maximum attainable voltage is around 30 MV. There could be other gases with even better insulating powers, but SF6 is also chemically inert and non-toxic. To increase the maximum acceleration energy further, the tandem concept was invented to use the same high voltage twice.  Tandem accelerators  Conventionally, positively charged ions are accelerated because this is the polarity of the atomic nucleus. However, if one wants to use the same static electric potential twice to accelerate ions, then the polarity of the ions' charge must change from anions to cations or vice versa while they are inside the conductor where they will feel no electric force. It turns out to be simple to remove, or strip, electrons from an energetic ion. One of the properties of ion interaction with matter is the exchange of electrons, which is a way the ion can lose energy by depositing it within the matter, something we should intuitively expect of a projectile shot at a solid. However, as the target becomes thinner or the projectile becomes more energetic, the amount of energy deposited in the foil becomes less and less. Tandems locate the ion source outside the terminal, which means that accessing the ion source while the terminal is at high voltage is significantly less difficult, especially if the terminal is inside a gas tank. So then an anion beam from a sputtering ion source is injected from a relatively lower voltage platform towards the high voltage terminal. Inside the terminal, the beam impinges on a thin foil (on the order of micrograms per square centimeter), often carbon or beryllium, stripping electrons from the ion beam so that they become cations. As it is difficult to make anions of more than -1 charge state, then the energy of particles emerging from a tandem is E=(q+1)V, where we have added the second acceleration potential from that anion to the positive charge state q emerging from the stripper foil; we are adding these different charge signs together because we are increasing the energy of the nucleus in each phase. In this sense, we can see clearly that a tandem can double the maximum energy of a proton beam, whose maximum charge state is merely +1, but the advantage gained by a tandem has diminishing returns as we go to higher mass, as, for example, one might easily get a 6+ charge state of a silicon beam. It is not possible to make every element into an anion easily, so it is very rare for tandems to accelerate any noble gases heavier than helium, although KrF‚àí and XeF‚àí have been successfully produced and accelerated with a tandem. It is not uncommon to make compounds in order to get anions, however, and TiH2 might be extracted as TiH‚àí and used to produce a proton beam, because these simple, and often weakly bound chemicals, will be broken apart at the terminal stripper foil. Anion ion beam production was a major subject of study for tandem accelerator application, and one can find recipes and yields for most elements in the Negative Ion Cookbook.Middleton, R: A Negative Ion Cookbook, University of Pennsylvania, unpublished, 1989 Online pdf Tandems can also be operated in terminal mode, where they function like a single-ended electrostatic accelerator, which is a more common and practical way to make beams of noble gases. The name 'tandem' originates from this dual- use of the same high voltage, although tandems may also be named in the same style of conventional electrostatic accelerators based on the method of charging the terminal.  Geometry  One trick which has to be considered with electrostatic accelerators is that usually vacuum beam lines are made of steel. However, one cannot very well connect a conducting pipe of steel from the high voltage terminal to the ground. Thus, many rings of a strong glass, like Pyrex, are assembled together in such a manner that their interface is a vacuum seal, like a copper gasket; a single long glass tube could implode under vacuum or fracture supporting its own weight. Importantly for the physics, these inter-spaced conducting rings help to make a more uniform electric field along the accelerating column. This beam line of glass rings is simply supported by compression at either end of the terminal. As the glass is non-conducting, it could be supported from the ground, but such supports near the terminal could induce a discharge of the terminal, depending on the design. Sometimes the compression is not sufficient, and the entire beam line may collapse and shatter. This idea is especially important to the design of tandems, because they naturally have longer beam lines, and the beam line must run through the terminal. Most often electrostatic accelerators are arranged in a horizontal line. However, some tandems may have a \\"U\\" shape, and in principle the beam can be turned to any direction with a magnetic dipole at the terminal. Some electrostatic accelerators are arranged vertically, where either the ion source or, in the case of a \\"U\\" shaped vertical tandem, the terminal, is at the top of a tower. A tower arrangement can be a way to save space, and also the beam line connecting to the terminal made of glass rings can take some advantage of gravity as a natural source of compression.  Particle energy  In a single-ended electrostatic accelerator the charged particle is accelerated through a single potential difference between two electrodes, so the output particle energy E is equal to the charge on the particle q multiplied by the accelerating voltage V :E = qV In a tandem accelerator the particle is accelerated twice by the same voltage, so the output energy is 2qV. If the charge q is in conventional units of coulombs and the potential V is in volts the particle energy will be given in joules. However because the charge on elementary particles is so small (the charge on the electron is 1.6x10‚àí19 coulombs), the energy in joules is a very small number. Since all elementary particles have charges which are multiples of the elementary charge on the electron, e = 1.6(10^{-19}) coulombs, particle physicists use a different unit to express particle energies, the electron volt (eV) which makes it easier to calculate. The electronvolt is equal to the energy a particle with a charge of 1e gains passing through a potential difference of one volt. In the above equation, if q is measured in elementary charges e and V is in volts, the particle energy E is given in eV. For example, if an alpha particle which has a charge of 2e is accelerated through a voltage difference of one million volts (1 MV), it will have an energy of two million electron volts, abbreviated 2 MeV. The accelerating voltage on electrostatic machines is in the range 0.1 to 25 MV and the charge on particles is a few elementary charges, so the particle energy is in the low MeV range. More powerful accelerators can produce energies in the giga electron volt (GeV) range.

Ferreira was then signed to Melbourne Victory's youth team playing in the National Youth League. He was a key player for two seasons, and was therefore promoted to the club's senior team. Club career On 31 March 2010, Ferreira made his senior debut for Melbourne Victory in their 1‚Äì0 victory over Kawasaki Frontale in the Asian Champions League. On 10 May 2010, he was signed to a two-year professional contract with Victory. On 15 September 2010, Ferreira made his first start for Melbourne Victory against Wellington Phoenix, playing 81 minutes before being substituted for Matthew Foschini. He scored his first A-League goal on 31 December, playing against Central Coast Mariners. Diogo scored a well placed goal in the 85th minute, in a 2‚Äì1 win for Melbourne. Despite being a regularly used player at Melbourne Victory, Ferreira, along with teammates Tando Velaphi, Spase Dilevski and Sam Gallagher were released by Melbourne Victory in April 2013, shortly after the end of the 2012‚Äì13 A-League season. He left the club, having made 52 out of a possible 84 appearances for the club. Shortly after his release from the Victory, Ferreira went on trial with rival A-League club Brisbane Roar. Less than two months after his release from the Victory, Ferreira was signed by the Roar on a one-year deal, along with former Sydney FC attacking midfielder Dimitri Petratos. In May 2014, Ferreira signed with Perth Glory. In August 2016, Ferreira signed a 4-month deal with Indonesia Soccer Championship side Persib Bandung to bolster the squad after Hermawan left the club for personal reasons. In January 2017, Ferreira signed a one-season deal with Penang FA. On 9 August 2017, Ferreira switched clubs and countries and signed for Indian club Mohun Bagan and became their fourth foreign signing of the season. He was released on 16 December, with Ferreira claiming \\"personal issues\\" for the action. International career Ferreira has represented the Australia Olympic football team on seven occasions, scoring one goal. In addition to his Australian citizenship, Ferreira also has Portuguese citizenship and is eligible to play for Portugal. Personal life Ferreira was born in Footscray, Melbourne. Diogo attended St. Bernard's College in Essendon which was also home to Patrick Kisnorbo.

A ISKCON guru is a person who is permitted to initiate disciples into the International Society for Krishna Consciousness system. The guru system has undergone several changes and reform since its beginnings in the 1960s. Upanayana as a traditional \\"sacred thread ceremony\\" of the Gayatri Mantra, commonly known Hindu Samskara, is complemented by Pancaratric mantras of the Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya and follows the principal initial nama initiation ceremony, referred to respectively as brahmana diksa and Hari nama diksa.First is synonymous to what in other Vaisnava traditions is called Saranagati Diksa or Pancha Samskara.  Etymology  ISKCON Gaudiya Vaishnavas often refer to lexicons of Amarako≈õa thesaurus of Sanskrit for meanings of words and according to the writings of the Gaudiya acharyas, the word guru is very often defined as one who; represents the Supreme Lord, who does not manufacture anything, but teaches in accordance with the scriptures (sastra) and the previous ƒÅcƒÅryas.A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami: The Science of Self Realization - What Is a Guru? \\"Reporter: How can a person tell he has a genuine guru? ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda: Can any of my students answer this question? Disciple: Once I remember John Lennon asked you, \\"How will I know who is the genuine guru?\\" And you answered, \\"Just find out the one who is most addicted to K·πõ·π£·πáa. He is genuine.\\" ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda: Yes. The genuine guru is God's representative, and he speaks about God and nothing else. The genuine guru is he who has no interest in materialistic life. He is after God, and God only. That is one of the tests of a genuine guru: brahma-ni·π£·π≠ham. He is absorbed in the Absolute Truth. In the Mu·πá·∏çaka Upani·π£ad it is stated, ≈õrotriya·πÅ brahma- ni·π£·π≠ham: [MU 1.2.12] \\"The genuine guru is well versed in the scriptures and Vedic knowledge, and he is completely dependent on Brahman.\\" He should know what Brahman [spirit] is and how to become situated in Brahman. These signs are given in the Vedic literature. As I said before, the real guru is God's representative. He represents the Supreme Lord, just as a viceroy represents a king. The real guru will not manufacture anything. Everything he says is in accordance with the scriptures and the previous ƒÅcƒÅryas This definition of a wider concept of guru in Hinduism links the question of the relative authority of the guru's words and those of the sastra in a crucial relationship. Baladeva Vidyabhushana, 18th century principal Gaudiya theologian used and defined guru in his commentaries on Vedanta-sutra. Specifically, in the comments to the sutras 3.3.44-45 Baladeva Vidyabhushana argues that the concept of guru's grace plays the central role in the system of teacher- student succession.\\"  Philosophy  Images on the dome of the samadhi of Prabhupada, pre-eminent siksa guru to all ISKCON devotees. Scriptural evidence towards the issue of a guru lies mainly in a large volume of Sanskrit work named Hari Bhakti Vilasa which received commentary by Sanatana Gosvami. It is the foundation of traditional Vaishnava philosophy and has 9.275 verses, divided in twenty chapters (called Vilasas). First chapter is dedicated to guru, with second dedicated to ritual process of initiation by the guru. The worship of guru is described towards the end of the third vilasa. The place of guru and his grace (prasada) plays a vital role in the Vaisnava traditions in general and in ISKCON Gaudiya Vaishnavism in particular. The generic view on a guru as a representative of God is a central feature to the tradition and philosophy: In contrast with the established traditional view of ISKCON some rare sahajia groups in Bengal treat their own preceptor (guru) as the living God.Pratibharanjan Maitra (ed.), Mursidabad carca. Khagra/Baharampur/Mursidabad: Mursidabad Carca Kendra, 1395 (Beng. Era), pp. 93-122. This view is different or contrasted to the concept of a guru being \\"as good as God\\". Unlike being a god in a human form,Kartabhajas on the contrast maintain: guru thaken sahasrare, sat-cakra upare \\"The guru resides in the Sahasrara [within the human body], on top of the six cakras\\". See Adbaita Candra Das: Sri satima candrika. Calcutta 1986, p. 87. the process of being appointed as a guru within ISKCON is currently done by a process which could be described as consensual or democratic and involves voting.Hrdayananda Dasa Goswami: The Role of the Guru in a Multi-Guru Society, ISKCON Communications Journal 8,1 (June 2000): 45-53. It is suggested that being as good as god is not a theological but a practical consideration, just as wife serves her husband in Hindu traditions as good as god.M√•ns Broo: As Good as God. The Guru in Gaudiya Vaisnavism. , [](√Öbo: √Öbo Akademis F√∂rlag 2003). p.79. While the \\"submission of the disciple is neither irrational or blind.\\" The question of qualification and humility remained opened for generations prior to creation of ISKCON in the West. In his speech Assuming Responsibility of Being Guru Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, who founded the popular branch of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition that resulted in creation of ISKCON, underlined the contrast of humility and responsibility of the performance of the duties of being a guru: It has been seen that much of the debate over authority and continuity over the years has focused on one issue: namely, whether current GBC members and gurus are spiritually qualified.T.K. Goswami, 'The Perils of Succession Heresies of Authority and Continuity In the Hare Krishna Movement ', Cults and Society, Vol. 1, 1, 2001.See also:‚ÄòLeader Misconduct, Religious Authority, and the Development of the Hare Krishna Movement,‚Äô in Anson Shupe, ed, Wolves Among the Fold. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1997 Guru in a post-charismatic phase of ISKCON is a subject of number studies and debates. According to the Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati ceremony of diksha in Gaudiya Vaisnavism, also called initiation, is that \\"by which the spiritual preceptor admits one to the status of a neophyte on the path of spiritual endeavor.\\" Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, Initiation Into The Spiritual Life, December 1928, Vol 26. 7 Sri Sajjana-toshani  Parallel lines of authority  ISKCON is seen as an extension of the Gaudiya-Vaishnava tradition and thus participates in the disciplic succession from Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In most Indic traditions spiritual authority rests in one person, or acharya, head of a monastery or a whole sampradaya. ISKCON is sometimes described as the \\"first global Vaisnava movement\\" and is different. ISKCON is a multi-guru organization that places the ultimate managerial authority in its Governing Body, a group rather than a single person. Current ISKCON Guru System is developed by the group of leaders, Governing Body Commission, (GBC), the managerial authority of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. ISKCON Guru system was originally initiated and put in place by ISKCON's founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada who organized and sometimes himself conducted initiations since early 1970s. Currently the GBC is entrusted with both spiritual and secular leadership of the ISKCON communities, as well as the power to appoint new gurus. According to a GBC confidence survey \\"those holding critical views of the GBC were far less committed to ISKCON\\" and it was also noted that householder members of ISKCON provides less support for ISKCON's gurus and the guru institution than the residents of ISKCON asramas controlled by GBC.Rochford, E. Burke (2007) [ Hare Krishna Transformed], p. 245,70. \\"GBC Confidence Survey\\" In recent years GBC started to develop a regional seminar \\"Spiritual Leadership: Being a Guru in ISKCON\\" and made it mandatory for all future gurus to attend. The course is based on the work of a group of seniors representing cross section of international devotees and is developed in coordination with Vaisnava Training and Education, the Guru Services Committee of GBC. It was launched in Ujjain just prior to the 2008 annual GBC meetings.Dasa, A.T. GBC Meetings 2008 - Day 2: ISKCON Guru Seminar, Scientific Preaching and Mayapur Academy Graduation. News. ISKCON.com Sastric Advisory Council to GBC has reported that there is a desire for control of who is ISKCON guru, the present system does not provides effective safeguards and at the same time contradicts the truly humble attitude of the Vaishnavas and is in danger of gradual corruption.From SAC statement: The GBC desires to exercise some control over who represents ISKCON as initiating gurus. The SAC proposes, however, that the present system does not provide effective safeguards, and at the same time it stifles initiative. In other words, applying for the guru post and approaching devotees for recommendations does not sit well with truly humble Vaisnavas. And it's the truly humble who are most worthy to become our Society's gurus. We should also be aware from the history of other sampradayas and religions of the real danger of gradual corruption. Even if apparent purity were maintained for some time by a bureaucratic regulating system of authorization, the eternal temptations of misusing the status of guru for self-aggrandizement could ruin the system and the institution. In future generations we, like other sampradayas, could become burdened with gurus who collect disciples mainly for money and power. Such corruption could occur even while maintaining the external appearance of bureaucratic purity. Therefore SAC suggests that the GBC shift their oversight to mainly after-the-fact. Exactly how this is to be implemented should be decided by the GBC. Bureaucratic processes about the suitability of a person to function as guru before the person has actually functioned as a guru have not proved successful as an effective guarantee. The actual behavior of the person as guru has, in practice, turned out to be the only effective basis for determining merit. One might argue that such a system does not guarantee that a guru will remain fixed on the spiritual platform, but that is true of any system.  Background  In 1977 eleven prominent leaders were left to become an initiating gurus in ISKCON. Since founder's death the number of ISKCON devotees accepting disciples has increased. Recently, some of grand-disciples (disciples of disciples) have begun to accept disciples in the next generation. Prabhupada is officially considered a Founder/Acharya, and is assumed to be \\"pre-eminent\\" guru of all devotees in his society. According to the theological epistemology of the tradition, scriptural or Vedic knowledge is the only way to achieve the knowledge of the out-worldly or transcendental realm. However the notable exception to this rule is what is called vaidushya-pratyaksa, or the faultless and pure perception of a pure realised soul, which forms the foundation of scripture itself.Sarva-samvadini commentary to Tattva sandarbhuas, 12, by Jiva Goswami cited in M√•ns Broo: As Good as God. The Guru in Gaudiya Vaisnavism. p. 9. There are few female gurus in Gaudiya Vaishnavism. In 2009, ISKCON began procedures to recognise female gurus. In a typical initiation ceremony as a guru of International Society for Krishna Consciousness he would begin with purification using achamana (holy water) and concludes with a sermon on the importance of chanting of the holy names in the life of new initiate.  History = Direct initiations  Satsvarupa das Goswami During ISKCON diksa ceremony in 1979. The history of initiations in ISKCON is started with the foundation of the society in 1966 and develops through a number of periods from the initial date to present times. During the first initiations in September 1966 disciples were given names, asked to remain strictly vegetarian and asked to chant 25 rounds of japa. Soon additional requirements followed, but the number of prescribed rounds of Hare Krishna japa was reduced to the minimum 16. Some devotees shaved their heads after the first initiation. First second initiation was in Boston, 9 May 1968 where only male devotees were initiated. However next day saw a number of women initiated too.According to Prabhupada: \\"Yes, there is definitely a vast difference between initiated and non-initiated. One who is initiated is authorized, and one who is not initiated is not authorized.\\" Letter to Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, 14 November 1968. From the period of the first initiation in 1966 until early 1970 Srila Prabhupada would organize all initiations personally. At this stage Hare Krishna movement was rather small in numbers and most of the devotees were located in United States.  Early deviations  At a festival at New Vrindaban, West Virginia, on Janmastami day 1970, four recently initiated sannyasis, Brahmananda, Gargamuni, Subala and Visnujana, were preaching that \\"Prabhupada is God.\\"Vaiyasaki dasa, Radha-Damodar Vilasa, \\"New Vrindaban Shakedown\\" pp. 299‚Äì318 All four were temporarily banned from preaching within ISKCON'.The Perils of Succession Heresies of Authority and Continuity In the Hare Krishna Movement ', Cults and Society, Vol. 1, 1, 2001.  Proxy initiations  Starting from 1971 Prabhupada would start delegating the function of chanting of beads and doing yajna to his disciples. He would often initiate by mail and every temple president had a cassette of Prabhupada chanting the gayatri mantra which was played in the ear of the new second initiate and that was as good as hearing the gayatri mantra from Srila Prabhupada himself.Letter to a temple president 15 December 1973 would state: \\"Take instruction from Satsvarupa Goswami on how to properly perform the fire yajna after which the initiates may listen once to the mantra in the right ear from the cassette tape I have made.\\" From the beginning of January 1973 Revatinandana and Kirtanananda were instructed also to chant on the beads of new initiates while Prabhupada would continue to deal with the \\"matter of brahmana initiations\\", however sometimes the mantra was given personally by disciples too.\\"Kirtanananda will chant on the beads for new devotees in America, Canada, like that, you can chant on the beads for the European continent new disciples.\\" Letter 73-01-04 cited in: Dasa, Hari Sauri A brief overview of the history of the process of initiation in ISKCON.Addressing a concern that one of the disciples, Siddhaswarupa started initiating his own disciples a letter to Tusta Krsna Swami, his associate, was sent on 2 December 1975: \\"Keep trained very rigidly, and then you are bona fide guru, and you can accept disciples on the same principle. But as a matter of etiquette it is the custom that during the lifetime of your spiritual master you bring the prospective disciples to him, and in his absence or disappearance you can accept disciples without any limitation. This is the law of disciplic succession. I want to see my disciples become bona fide spiritual master and spread Krishna consciousness very widely; that will make me and K·πõ·π£·πáa very happy.\\"Letter to Siddha Svarupananda -- Johannesburg 20 October 1975: I am in due receipt of your letter dated 25 Sept. with enclosed Guru-daksina and I thank you very much. I am pleased to accept your recommendation for the first initiation of William and Barbara Renaroza. Letter to Sudevi -- Los Angeles 15 September 1972: Regarding Siddhasvarupananda, these things which you have heard are simply rumor and there is no substance. Siddhasvarupa does not want to take disciples  Initiations in 1977  In 1977 that was also changed by Prabhupada, and even the function of the second initiation was delegated to a few selected disciples. In the middle of May 1977, while in Hrishikesh, his health had turned for the worse and Prabhupada called all his GBC members to Vrindavana for instruction.When they arrived PrabhupƒÅda told them, \\"Now, if you have any questions about anything that is not clear, you meet together, you formulate your questions, and then you come to me and I will answer them.\\" The discussion of 28 May was recorded. There was a backlog of candidates and on 9 July a letter by his secretary, Tamal Krishna Goswami, was sent out, and that named eleven senior disciples who would now be responsible for giving initiations to the new candidates. At this point the new candidates need no longer write to him and the recommendations don‚Äôt have to come to him for confirmation.  After death  A number of scholars have documented the struggle for authority created by Prabhupada's departure. Two supporters of ISKCON, Shriman Narayan, the former Governor of Gujarat and a prominent industrialist Ram Krishna Bajaj raised issues of the appointment of a single successor from among his followers. Prabhupada answered that all his disciples would succeed him. = Period of no initiations = The period from the date of death until the March 1978 annual meeting saw no initiations in ISKCON outside of Kirtanananda Swami's zone.\\"[W]hen the GBC held its first meeting in the absence of Srila Prabhupada in Mayapura in early 1978, the issue of how to proceed with initiations was the main agenda item. We had no experience and many members felt that the more input we had on it the better.. . . Kirtanananda I think was the exception. He had started giving initiations almost immediately after Srila Prabhupada's disappearance.\\" Hari-sauri dasa, \\"The Hand of Fate...\\" Vaishnava Blog Feeds (http://www.prabhupada.org/rama/?p=4476) accessed on 5 March 2010. Annual meeting of Governing commission of ISKCON was scheduled before Gaura Purnima festival in March and Prabhupada long established that the GBC are his \\"direct representatives to act as the instrument for the execution of the will of His Divine Grace\\". = Early Zonal acharyas period = From 1978 until 1982, only eleven devotees were allowed to initiate new disciples and give brahmana (or second) initiation to existing ISKCON devotees, who became known as Prabhupada's disciples despite receiving sampradaya mantra from new ISKCON gurus. There was noticeable difference between these newly appointed ISKCON gurus and Prabhupada. The new ISKCON gurus, known as Zonal acharyas, were all young and immature, Kirtanananda Swami was the eldest at 40‚Äîmany were still in their twenties‚Äîand some had only been devotees for five years at the time of their appointment. Yet they had not only become the movement's elders, they were catapulted to an absolute status. Beginning in 1980, less than three years after Prabhupada's death, guru controversies arose in rapid succession. In general, ISKCON was led by young men who, until the formation of the first schisms, wielded much power despite their lack of maturity. In the words of one GBC member: \\"In Prabhupada's time the only problem was that there was only one real adult in the movement.\\"Brian Bloch Social Theory and Schisms in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Presentation on ISKCON Studies conference, 2008 = Mid Zonal acharyas period = In 1982, a few new gurus were added to the list, including Gopala Krishna Goswami and Bhaktisvarupa Damodar Swami. All gurus at this stage were assigned honorific names, such as Srila Gurudeva, Srila Vishnupada, Srila Gurupada, Srila Acharyadeva, Srila Bhagavatpada, Srila Bhaktipada etc., they also accepted daily worship on a Vyasasana, the throne was allocated to each person, but a collective Vyasasanas were specially constructed for gatherings. When one of the eleven gurus, Jayatirtha, left for the Gaudiya Math by waking out the Mayapur campus towards Swami Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar, the latter tried to mediate between the GBC and Jayatirtha, who recently took sannyasa, but that increased tensions with Gaudiya Math and Sridhara Swami's followers serving in ISKCON. That year, 1982, GBC expelled Jayatirtha from ISKCON and a sub- committee was sent in the middle of the meetings to his GBC zone to prevent the crisis. His disciples had locked themselves in a separate building near Bhaktivedanta Manor and would not engage in negotiations. Later a separate committee was formed to appoint new ISKCON gurus for his zone.[ Betrayal of the spirit: my life behind the headlines of the Hare Krishna] By Nori Jean Muster, University of Illinois Press. p. 83 During this period at least one of the eleven gurus had suggested lowering the worship received, but this motion was not passed.Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, Journals and Poems, vol.1-2 Gita Nagari Press 1980‚Äì1986. = Zonal Guru reform = A number of devotees, all directly initiated by Prabhupada, were observing that many controlling positions were being lost to disciples of new gurus. Additionally, one of the gurus was conditionally suspended during the August 1985 GBC meetings at New Vrindaban for sexual misconduct. An informal group headed by Ravindra Svarupa Dasa and others was formed in 1984 to investigate and gather information about possible deviations in different regions. This campaign resulted in Temple Presidents meeting in New Vrindavana, September 1985, headed by Bahudaka Das, the President of the North American Temple Presidents, Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, Vice President and Krishna Gopal Das, the Secretary. A threat of no confidence vote was issued towards the Governing Body Commission and demand that all power to be returned to direct disciples of Prabhupada. A number of senior GBCs, including Tamal Krishna Goswami and Satsvarupa Das Goswami, became active supporters of the reform, at least by late 1986. However, in November 1985 European management assembly had issued a protest against the demands of the North American temple presidents and issued a joint statement. The reformers aimed at removing dedicated vyasasanas from the temple space, stopping daily guru puja ceremonies for new gurus and reforming use of honorifics among others, reserving use of His Divine Grace,-pada and -deva honorifics only towards Prabhupada himself. A demand to include new GBCs and new ISKCON gurus was issued and 1986 saw both resignations of a number of Zonal gurus and increased number of new gurus and GBCs. End of 1985 also saw an attack on most senior ISKCON guru, Kirtanananda Swami, who refused to accept lowering of the worship and insisted that he should retain the title of Founder/acharya of New Vrindavana. Following this conflict between this largest ISKCON community and the reformers New Vrindavana was officially expelled from ISKCON in 1988, all reformers shortly became new ISKCON gurus and many of them were elected as the new GBC. (Bozeman. 2000)  Siddhaswarupa  Siddhaswarupananda Goswami or Chris Butler was an American Sanyasi disciple of Bhaktivedanta Swami. Known by various honorifics (His Divine Grace, Jagat Guru, Paramahamsa, Srila Prabhupad), he is the founder of the Science of Identity Foundation, and had a following in the yoga training prior to joining ISKCON under the name of Sai. He did not accept the existing leadership and faced a conflict with the GBC management structure. The tension between Siddhaswarupa and GBC management continued to increase, although Siddhaswarupa maintained a cordial relationship with Bhaktivedanta Swami. After the death of his guru Bhaktivedanta Swami in 1977, Siddhaswarupa took the role of diksha (initiating) guru and began to initiate disciples.http://www.scienceofidentityfoundation.org/about_jagad_guru - Teaching on behalf of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, 7th sentence Having accepted the title of Jagad Guru (World Teacher) from his disciples, he sees himself in this lineage of non-appointed devotees.http://www.jagadgurusiddhaswarupananda.org - Teaching on behalf of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, 2nd paragraph He became a founding member of the World Vaishnava Association  Gaudiya Math leaders  Many deviations or guru related schisms are centered on charismatic individual leadership. After the pre-1977 departure of Siddhaswarupa, a number of ISKCON devotees started following variety of Gaudiya Math gurus, all of whom were individual leaders of separate parallel institutions. One of the leaders of the schismatic groups was Bhaktivedanta Narayana Maharaja, who was a friend and a well-wisher of ISKCON for many years and a personal friend of Prabhupada. While Narayana Maharaja's large following was restricted to non-ISKCON Indians prior to 1991, with an exception of a few ISKCON Vrindavana residents, nearly all of his post-1991 Western followers were previously ISKCON members, and since the majority of his Western followers have left ISKCON in 1995 after the GBC action, these followers have turned to ISKCON for fresh recruits escalating the conflict. Following many years of apparent confrontation in April 2010 ISKCON's Governing Body Commission has released a forty-page document that clarifies the good relationship between Prabhupada and Narayana Maharaja. This document follows up a meeting between Narayana Maharaja and several senior members of the GBC in October 2009 at the sacred town of Govardhana, India. During the meeting, ISKCON leaders apologized to Narayana Maharaja for their failure to communicate with him in a proper and timely manner in 1995, regarding policies they had just established concerning members of ISKCON taking instruction from other gurus outside of their society.M. Smullen. ISKCON News. New GBC Paper Clarifies Relationship Between Srila Prabhupada and Narayana Maharaja.  The Ritvik Idea  As news of ISKCON gurus‚Äô misdeeds spread in late 1980s, some ISKCON members began to question the validity of Prabhupada's having appointed members to the role of the spiritual master. Because no disciple can be equal to or more than Jagadguru Srila Prabhupada a Mahabhagavata Acharya in Gaudiya Vaishnava Parampara. So in Parampara system only Five prominent Acharyas are considered and worshiped (A C Bhaktivedanta Swami, Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati, Goura Kishora Das Babaji, Bhaktivinoda Thakur, Jagannatha Das Babaji). Members in early 1990s attempted to prove that there was no need for any new gurus; rather, Prabhupada's disciples could initiate newcomers on Prabhupada's behalf as proxies for Prabhupada (the Sanskrit word ‡§ã‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç ritwik or ritvik means \\"officiating priest\\").

The first strain, Roundup Ready canola, was developed by Monsanto for tolerance to glyphosate, the active ingredient in the commonly used herbicide Roundup. Genetic modification Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum herbicide, which is used to kill weeds and grasses which are known to compete with commercial crops grown around the world. The first product came onto the market in the 1970's under the name ‚ÄòRoundup‚Äô. Plants which are exposed to glyphosate are unable to produce aromatic amino acids and in turn die. To produce the Roundup Ready canola, two genes were introduced into the canola genome. One is a gene derived from the common soil bacterium Agrobacterium strain CP4, that encodes for the EPSPS enzyme. The other is a gene from the Ochrobactrum anthropi strain LBAA, which encodes for the enzyme glyphosate oxidase (GOX). The CP4 EPSPS enzyme imparts high tolerance to glyphosate, so the plants can still create aromatic amino acids even after glyphosate is applied. GOX helps break down glyphosate within the plant. Regulation Genetically modified crops undergo a significant amount of regulation throughout the world. For a GM crop to be approved for release in the US, it must be assessed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) agency within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and may also be assessed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental protection agency (EPA), depending on the intended use. The USDA evaluates the plant's potential to become a weed. The FDA regulates crops used as food or animal feed.FDA page on Regulation of GM Plants in Animal Feed In Canada, the largest producer of GM canola,GMO Compass Rapeseed 27 July 2010. Retrieved 6 August 2010. GM crops are regulated by Health Canada, under the Food and Drugs Act, and the Canadian Food Inspection AgencyCanadian Food Inspection Agency - Regulating Agricultural Biotechnology are responsible for evaluating the safety and nutritional value of genetically modified foods. Environmental assessments of biotechnology-derived plants are carried out by the CFIA's Plant Biosafety Office (PBO).Genetically Modified Food. In Australia Roundup Ready Canola was approved for commercial production in 2003 by the Gene Technology Regulator after undergoing approximately 400 tests and studies to determine it was safe. Food Standards Australia New Zealand also approved this product as being safe for human consumption in the same year. Controversy Controversy exists over the use of food and other goods derived from genetically modified crops instead of from conventional crops, and other uses of genetic engineering in food production. The dispute involves consumers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, nongovernmental organizations, and scientists. The key areas of controversy related to GMO foods are whether they should be labeled, the role of government regulators, the objectivity of scientific research and publication, the effect of GM crops on health and the environment, the effect on pesticide resistance, the impact of GM crops for farmers, and the role of GM crops in feeding the world population. There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Advocacy groups such as Greenpeace, the Non-GMO Project, and Organic Consumers Association say that risks of GM food have not been adequately identified and managed, and have questioned the objectivity of regulatory authorities. They have expressed concerns about the objectivity of regulators and rigor of the regulatory process, about contamination of the non-GM food supply,Paull, John (2019) Contamination of Farms by Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs): Options for Compensation, Journal of Organics, 6(1):31-46. about effects of GMOs on the environment and nature, and about the consolidation of control of the food supply in companies that make and sell GMOs. Resistances problems Due to the heavy reliance of glyphosate in agriculture, resistance to this chemical is a problem and is prevalent throughout Australia, the USA, and Canada. Roundup canola has also emerged as a weed in other crops due to its glyphosate resistance. This is due to canola seed being able to be dormant in the soil for up to 10 years. In California, it has become a significant problem in this way because of the restrictions on phenoxy herbicides being used in the state due to crops such as the sensitivity of cotton and grapes to this chemical.

After selling his rights to the Captaincy of S√£o Miguel to Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara, he continued as Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria. Biography=Early life Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria was the son of Fern√£o Soares de Albergaria and Teresa Velho Cabral, the latter a sister of Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral. He married Brites Godins, who quickly became sick. Their marriage would not produce heirs. In 1474, due to his wife's illness, Albergaria moved to the island of Madeira in order to \\"find remedies and medics\\", as well as a milder climate for her to convalesce in. They lodged with the family of the Captain of Funchal Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco and that of his brother, Rui Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara. As Azorean chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso would later relate, due to S√£o Miguel's perceived unproductivity and the many costs Soares de Albergaria incurred during his move to Funchal and treatments for his wife, Albergaria decided to sell the Captaincy of S√£o Miguel to Rui Gon√ßalves for his hospitality in return for 2,000 cruzados and of sugar.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.22-23 Beatriz, Duchess of Viseu and Diogo, Duke of Viseu approved this contract, and King Afonso V of Portugal ratified it on 10 March 1474. Captaincy During his captaincy, Albergaria promoted settlement of Santa Maria‚Äîattracting settlers from both Portugal (mainly Algarve) and continental Europe‚Äîand founded the principal village of Vila do Porto. It became the base for future Captains-Generals in the Azores. Before this, his maternal uncle Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral had been \\"Commander of Santa Maria and Captain of the Azores\\" within a structural framework that was not properly defined. In contrast, King Afonso V explicitly approved Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria's captaincy in a 1474 edict: As captain-general Albergaria was also responsible for the island's defense. However, in 1480 a Castilian corsair attacked Vila do Porto during the War of the Castilian Succession, sacking the town. Albergaria was captured and taken prisoner to Castile, where he was ransomed.Figueiredo (1990), p.67/74Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.20 He paid his own ransom eight days before peace were declared by Afonso V and Ferdinand of Castile at the end of 1480. Later life Albergaria later married Branca de Sousa Falc√£o, daughter of Jo√£o de Sousa Falc√£o, 1st Lord de Figueiredo and 1st Lord of the Manor de Fata√∫n√ßos, and D. Maria de Almada. They married on 20 June 1492 on the orders of King Jo√£o II. They had at least four children together: * Jo√£o Soares de Sousa, who would inherit his father's title as 3rd Donatary-Captain of Santa Maria; * Pedro Soares, who died overseas in Portuguese India; * D. Maria, who married in Portugal; and * D. Violante, who married a Castilian in Santa Maria. Albergaria returned to Santa Maria from Madeira late in life. He died there in 1499 at 80 years of age. The captaincy of Santa Maria passed on to his descendants until its extinction in 1667, following the death Br√°s Soares de Sousa in 1664.A royal decree dated 23 May 1667 integrated the Captaincy of Santa Maria into the House of Castelo Melhor, while the captaincy system would be completely abolished in 1766 in the context of reforms instituted by the Marquis of Pombal (Arquivo dos A√ßores, 1981, IV: 205).

The flowers are large, 10‚Äì13 cm wide, they are yellow in color and scentless. They are found on long stalks and face downwards and the plant doesn't produce nectar. The flower blooms daily at around 3am and is fully bloomed one hour before sunrise. Other sources say (Corners) bees appear to be the pollinators that gather their pollen, as well as by small beetles and flies that scramble over the flowers, the flower moves in the appropriate position to prepare for fruit growth (pointing up when the flower starts to produce fruits, the fruits take up to 5 weeks to develop. The fruit is pink and is a star-shaped capsule with purple seeds that have a fleshy bright red aril. The fruits are eaten by birds and even monkeys. Distribution and habitat The plant is found in tropical South East Asia in secondary forest and swampy grounds that are undisturbed forest such as riversides up to 700 m altitude. They can also be found on alluvial places such as swamps, mangroves, riversides, but sometimes also present on hillsides and ridges, which have clayey to sandy soil texture. Dillenia Suffruticosa is also found in Sri Lanka, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, in the tropical regions of Singapore, and Hawaii. Uses Dillenia suffruticosa has other uses, these include medicine and storage. The medicinal properties include the leaves and roots being used against inflammations, itch, stomach ache, and recovery after delivery. The storage properties consist of large leaves of the plant being used to wrap food (tempeh or fermented soy bean cake) instead of using a plastic bag and/or the leaves can be shaped into a cone to contain or hold food (rojak). Other uses are, they can be used to attract birds in urban areas and planted as an ornamental plant.  Taxonomy  Dillenia suffruticosa was discovered by Martelli in Malesia in 1886.

Thiruvathirai (Arudhra) in Tamil means \\"sacred big wave\\", using which this universe was created by Lord Shiva about 132 trillion years ago. Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu, the Sri Natarajar temple's annual Festival, is celebrated on this date. In the month of Makaram Thiruvathira Star is celebrated in Mathira Peedika Devi Temple, owned by Thiruvithamcore Devaswom Board, near Kadakkal in Kollam District of Kerala state.Thiruvathira has a connection with lord moon. Arudra Darisanam in Chidambaram (Thillai) Thiruvadirai - Arudra Darisanam is celebrated in a grand manner in 5 Sabhas of Sri Natarajar namely 1) Kanakasabha (Gold) - at Chidambaram (Thillai or Tillai), 2) Velli Sabhai (Silver) at Madurai, 3) Ratnasabha (Ruby) at Tiruvalankadu, 4) Tamrasabha (Copper) at Tirunelveli, 5) Chitrasabha (Pictures) at Kutralam. In Thillai Chidambaram 10 day Festival is held during Thiruvathirai. On the 9th day night (i.e., 10th day very early morning) Maha Abhishekam will be done to Lord Nataraja and Goddess Sivakamasundari at Raja Sabhai at around 3 am. The MahaAbhishekam will be held for about 3‚Äì4 hours. Then special Thiruvabaranam (Sacred Jewels) Alankaram, Rahasiya Pujai will be done to Sri Natarajar. Pancha Murthi Thiruveethi Ula, will be held at around 12 pm Noon. Soon after Pancha Murthi Ula in the afternoon Lord Natarajar and Goddess Sivakami will bless devotees with Aarudra Darisanam and enter Kanaka Sabhai (Golden Sabha). Origin It takes place on the full moon night in the Tamil month of Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary) and this is also the longest night in a year. Literary and historical evidence in the form of stone inscriptions state that the festival has been celebrated on this day for more than 1500 years. Lord Shiva is praised in Tamil by many names, one of them is Athiraiyan (‡ÆÜ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Æ©‡Øç ), from Thiruvathirai (Thiru + Athirai). Tamil hymns of Maanikavasagar's Thiruvasagam (particularly the hymns Thiruvempavai and Thiruppalliezhuchi) are chanted in temples. On the very day of Thiruvathirai the idols of Nataraja (Lord Shiva) and his consort Shivagami (Parvati) are taken out of the temple premises for a grand procession. It is one of the major events in almost all the Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu.

In essence, it represents the continuous cycle of creation and destruction. This cosmic dance takes place in every particle and is the source of all energy. Arudra Darshan celebrates this ecstatic dance of Lord Shiva. It is essentially a Shaivite festival and celebrates the cosmic dance of Lord Shiva, which is represented by the Nataraja form. Arudhra (Thiruvathirai in Tamil) signifies the golden red flame and Shiva performs the dance in the form this red-flamed light. Lord Shiva is supposed to be incarnated in the form of Lord Nataraja during the Arudra Darshan day. Most of the temples around the world with Lord Nataraja and Shiva as deity perform the Arudhra Darshan. Neivedhyam (food for God) made for Lord Nataraja on that day is Thiruvathirai Kali. The festival is celebrated by Sri Lankan Tamils at Thinnapuram Sundareswarar Temple, it is called Eezhathu Chidambaram. In 2013, Arudhara Darshan is on 18 December. Significance in Tamil Nadu In Tamil Nadu, the unmarried women will fast during the day time. They will take food before sunrise and start their fasting(called Thiruvempavai Nonbu). They will break the fast after witnessing the moon rise. Nonbu (fasting) starts nine days before and ends on Thiruvathirai day so totally they fast for ten days. There is special food called Thiruvadhirai kali made of Rice, Jaggery, Moong dhall, Coconut, Cardamom and Ghee with Thiruvathirai ezhlu curry koottu, which is made out of seven vegetables, that is cooked and served on this day. They choose from Pooshanikai (pumpkin), Paranghikai (ash gourd), Vazhakkai (plantain), Pacha mochai (field beans), Sarkaraivalli kizhangu (sweet potato), Cheppan kizhangu (colocasia), Urulai kizhangu (potato), Katharikai (eggplant) etc. The dancing form of Lord Shiva is taken out on procession from all Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. In Chidambaram, The night before the full moon, Abishekam, or holy shower, to the Lord Shiva is performed with the nine most precious gems (navarathnam), including diamonds, coral, pearls, jade and emerald, among others. On the day of full moon, the chariot procession takes place. The most important Arudhra Darshan festival takes place at the Chidambaram Shiva Temple in Tamil Nadu. The cosmic dance of Lord Shiva is enacted on the day. Significance in Kerala Women performing Thiruvathirakali Thiruvathira is the nakshatra or \\"star\\" of Lord Shiva as per the Malayalam calendar.It is believed that on this day, the Goddess Parvathi finally met Lord Shiva after her long penance and Lord Shiva took her as a saha-dharma chaarini (equal partner). Both Parvathi and Shiva present this ideal to devotees in the form of Ardhanarishvara (half male, half female form).Another belief is that the festival commemorates the death of Kamadeva, the Hindu god of erotic desire. In Kerala, Thiruvathira is an important traditional festival along with the other popular festivals, Onam and Vishu. This has been celebrated by the Nambuthiri, Kshatriya and Nair communities of Kerala from days of yore. It is largely a festival for women; unmarried women observe a partial fast on this day to get good husbands and married women take a fast from the preceding day (Makayiram nakshatra) and on the day of Thiruvathira for the well being of their husband and family. The first Thiruvathira of a newly wedded woman is her poothiruvathira. Thiruvathira puzhukkuThiruvathira Ettangadi The fast essentially involves abstaining from rice-based food. The typical meal includes cooked broken wheat and Thiruvathira puzhukku, a delightful mix of tuber vegetables: colocasia (chembu), yam (chena), Chinese potato (koorka), sweet potato (madhurakizhangu) with long beans (vanpayar) and raw plantain fruit (ethakaya), cooked with a thick paste of freshly ground coconut. The dessert is koova payasam, a sweet dish made of arrow root powder, jaggery and coconut milk. Thiruvathirakali is a dance form performed by women on the day of Thiruvathira to the accompaniment of Thiruvathira paattu, folk songs telling tales of lovesick Parvati, her longing and penance for Lord Shiva's affection and Shiva's might and power. The sinuous movements executed by the group of dancers around a nilavilakku embody lasya or the amorous charm and grace of the feminine. The dance follows a circular, pirouetting pattern accompanied by clapping of the hands and singing. Today, Thiruvathirakali has become a popular dance form for all seasons.Thiruvathira kali is a typical dance form of Kerala. This is a female group dance made up of simple yet very attractive steps. In ancient times, women use to perform this dance in their homes during festivals and functions, giving it the Malayalam name aka Kaikottikali: aka-inside + kaikottikali-play claping hands. Lore has it that Thiruvathira Kali is in memory of Lord Siva taking Parvathi as his wife. A group of women dressed in typical Kerala style with mundu and neriyathu and the hair bun adorned with jasmine garlands perform this dance during festival seasons.. Kaikottikkali spreads the message of joy and also illustrates the emotions of a married woman towards her beloved and of the unmarried woman longing for one. Thiruvathira is also known as the Kerala's own version of Karva Chauth World records related to ThiruvathiraKali The record for the world's largest Thiruvathira belongs to Twenty20 Kizhakkambalam. The 16-minute performance, held on 1 May 2017, has been adjudged the largest Thiruvathira ever held with a total of 6,582 girls and women in the age group of 10-75 participating in it.

Social and behavior change communication (SBCC), often also only \\"BCC\\" or \\"Communication for Development (C4D)\\" is an interactive process of any intervention with individuals, group or community (as integrated with an overall program) to develop communication strategies to promote positive behaviors which are appropriate to their settings and thereby solving the world's most pressing health problems. This in turn provides a supportive environment which will enable people to initiate, sustain and maintain positive and desirable behavior outcomes. SBCC is the strategic use of communication to promote positive health outcomes, based on proven theories and models of behavior change. SBCC employs a systematic process beginning with formative research and behavior analysis, followed by communication planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Audiences are carefully segmented, messages and materials are pre-tested, and mass media (which include radio, television, billboards, print material, internet), interpersonal channels (such as client-provider interaction, group presentations) and community mobilisation are used to achieve defined behavioral objectives. BCC should not be confused with behavior modification, a term with specific meaning in a clinical psychiatry setting. SBCC differentiates itself from Social impact entertainment (SIE) primarily through its \\"impact first\\", rather than \\"story first\\", approach.  Background  Providing people with information and teaching them how they should behave does not lead to desirable change in their response/behavior. However, when there is a supportive environment with information and communication (teaching) then there is a desirable change in the behavior of the target group. Thus, SBCC is proved to be an instructional intervention which has a close interface with education and communication. It is a strategic and group oriented form of communication to perceive a desired change in behavior of target group. However, it is not as easy as it sounds, as there is no one- size-fits all strategy for any intervention. Interventions are context specific. Therefore, there is a need for proper information management and sharing. It is advised to document and report the interventions that worked somewhere, for example, the kind of messages, the medium and the audience. Steps SBCC is the comprehensive process in which one passes through the stages: Unaware > Aware > Concerned > Knowledgeable > Motivated to change > Practicing trial behavior change > Sustained behavior changeSBCC in classroom practices It involves the following steps: # State program goals # Involve stakeholders # Identify target populations # Conduct formative BCC assessments # Segment target populations # Define behavior change objectives # Define SBCC strategy & monitoring and evaluation plan # Develop communication products # Pretest # Implement and monitor # Evaluate # Analyze feedback and revise  Enabling factors  Behavior change is influenced by motivation from others (external influence) as well as from within oneself (internal influence). Internal influence plays a significant role in creating more enjoyment of a behavior change, instilling a sense of ownership of the new behavior, which in turn instills a sense of ownership of the changed behavior. When designing SBCC strategies, enabling factors that affect the outcome must be considered. The following are some of the factors: * Effective communication * Enabling environment, which include policies, human rights community values and norms * User-friendly, accessible services and commodities Theories SBCC has several levels at which it can be implemented. Each level includes several theories. Each level (and each theory) employs specific communication channels. ;Individual level * Health belief model * Theory of reasoned action and planned behavior * Transtheoretical model/Stages of change * Social learning theory ;Community level * Diffusion of innovations theory * Community mobilization ;Change in organizations * 4 stage change ;Public policy Level * Distinct stages of initiation, action, implementation, evaluation and re- formulation The SBCC Summit 2018 in Bali, Indonesia, focusing on social and behavior change communication and featuring Entertainment-Education. Over 1,200 attendees came to the 2018 SBCC Summit, where Entertainment-Education was a main topic among Social and Behavior Chance Communications professionals. Strategies SBCC is different from the ordinary instructional method of communication and is target specific. A society consists of many sub-groups. The strategy for SBCC will vary from group to group. The following points are important while considering the SBCC strategy. * Vulnerability/risk factor of the target group * The vulnerability/risk factor of the group which is to be addressed * The conflict and obstacles in the way to desired change in behavior * Type of message and communication media which can best be used to reach the target group * Type of resources available and assessment of existing knowledge of the target group about the issue which is going to be dealt with There can be several more points in this list. A successful SBCC requires much research and meticulous planning about the knowledge content of the subject and behavior/attitude pattern of the target group. Social marketing has been described as a tool for sustainable behaviour change. Implications SBCC has proven effective in several health areas, such as increasing the use of family planning methods, reducing the spread of malaria and other infectious diseases, and improving newborn and maternal health. SBCC is an effective tool for dealing with many community and group related problems. BCC has been adapted as an effective strategy for community mobilization, health and environmental education and various public outreach programs. Enhanced knowledge about the behavior change process has facilitated the design of communications programs to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and AIDS. A wide variety of health promotion strategies use communication as either an educational or norm-forming strategy. In addition, specific strategies must be designed for high-risk groups such as women, young people, injecting drug abusers, homosexuals and HIV positive groups. Role in HIV/AIDS SBCC constitutes of effective communication which is central to the success of interventions to reduce the risk of HIV infection.

Owen regularly performs at festivals, concerts and events around Australia and further abroad. She favours classical and Celtic/folk songs, but also sings pop and jazz on occasion. Early life Owen was born on 4 October 1993 in North Wales and lived in the Anglesey village of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch (or Llanfairpwllgwyngyll for short) before moving to Australia with her family in November 1995. At a young age, Owen was encouraged to join the Adelaide Girls Choir (now Young Adelaide Voices) and the St Aloysius College) school choir, where she became a regular soloist. Owen began her classical voice training at age nine, with singing teachers Naomi Hede and Norma Knight. She entered her first Eisteddfod around this time winning an Honourable Mention in the nine to thirteen age group. It wasn't long before Owen started winning Eisteddfods, most notably the Classical Voice sections. First performances Owen's first solo performance on stage came just after her 10th birthday, in 2003, when she sang in a Riverdance Style show called \\"Shades of Green\\", organised by the Adelaide Irish Dancing Association, which toured South Australian theatres.

The same year, Owen received a Music Scholarship from St Aloysius College and a Choral Scholarship from St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral Choir, where she remained a soloist and chorister for over three years. In August 2007, aged 13, Owen gave her first solo concert for Recitals Australia. She continues to perform for Recitals Australia every year.

She had harp lessons from renowned Adelaide singer/harpist Emma Horwood, and was soon accompanying herself with harp in Celtic and Folk Festivals, concerts and recitals. Owen commissioned South Australian harp maker and luthier Tim Guster to build her a 36-string Celtic harp with special carving. This harp has travelled with Owen all over Australia.

As a performer, he was a member of the Crew Chiefs vocal group and the Glenn Miller Orchestra.  Early life  Kane was born in 1915 in Brooklyn, New York. During high school, Kane hosted a radio show on WNEW alongside Hal Kanner.  Career = Early career  Around 1937‚Äì38, after graduating from high school, Kane and Kanner recruited a female vocalist and performed under the names of \\"The Manhattanites\\" and \\"Two Bees and A Honey\\". The group was later joined by Daisy Brennier, and they performed with Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians on the Chesterfield radio tour.  Glenn Miller Orchestra  During World War II, Kane was a member of Glenn Miller's Army Air Force Orchestra, performing with them overseas for the duration of the war.  The Crew Chiefs  Kane's military career originally saw him as a Private First Class officer in the US Army. In 1943, Kane formed The Crew Chiefs with Sergeant Steve Steck, Corporal Artie Malvin, and Privates Lynn Allison and Gene Steck. Around the same time, his rank was changed to that of Corporal. His despondency at this move led him to compose \\"Have Ya Got Any Gum, Chum?\\", quoting a popular phrase used between children and soldiers. Kane left the group in 1945.  Management career  After leaving The Crew Chiefs, Kane became a talent scout in New York City. He managed and composed for the DeMarco Sisters and secured them as a permanent fixture on Fred Allen's radio show. In 1950, Kane became the vocal arranger for The McGuire Sisters, after hearing them perform on Kate Smith's radio show. Kane's compositions and arrangements helped the group secure an audition (and contract) at Decca Records. Kane subsequently became their personal manager, and helped arrange their breakthrough performance on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. The group retired in 1968. Through his work with The McGuire Sisters, Kane also worked with The Kane Triplets, who later performed on The Jack Benny Show, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Mike Douglas Show, The Perry Como Show and The Tonight Show. In 1984, Kane restarted The McGuire Sisters' career with a song entitled \\"The Second Time Around\\".  Later life and death  Kane moved to Las Vegas in 1975. He died in Las Vegas on January 31, 1986 at the age of 70.
