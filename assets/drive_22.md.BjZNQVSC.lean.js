McGarvey is best known for his exploits in Galicia, where he operated a highly successful petroleum company. McGarvey was one of the most successful \\"foreign drillers\\" of Petrolia, becoming a multimillionaire before the outbreak of the First World War destroyed his business. Biography  Early life  William Henry McGarvey was born in Huntingdon, Quebec, to Edward and Sarah McGarvey in November 1843. In 1857, the McGarvey family moved to Wyoming, Ontario, where Edward established a general store that prospered with the arrival of the Great Western Railway and the development of the oil fields in Oil Springs and Petrolia. In 1861, McGarvey relocated to Petrolia and opened up a general store known locally as \\"The Mammoth Store.\\" When Petrolia incorporated as a village in December 1866, McGarvey became its first reeve, holding the position until March 5, 1867. McGarvey also served on Petrolia's town council from 1868 to 1870, was elected Mayor in 1876 and became warden of Lambton County in 1879. He ran unsuccessfully for provincial office in 1879. In 1876, the Geological Survey of Canada commissioned McGarvey to lead a survey of eastern Saskatchewan's mineral resources. Petroleum magnate During his time at Petrolia, McGarvey invested into the petroleum industry, having stakes in eighteen oil properties, including the famous \\"Deluge\\" well struck in 1873 and a partnership in an oil refinery. In 1879, McGarvey met British engineer and oil operator John Simeon Bergheim when he travelled to Petrolia to recruit men willing to drill in Europe. The men quickly became friends and partners, and in 1881 the pair moved to √ñlheim, near Hanover to drill for oil. This venture resulted in limited success, and in 1882 McGarvey and Bergheim proceeded to Galicia and Romania. The pair formed the Bergheim & McGarvey company in 1883, and introduced the Canadian \\"pole tool drilling\\" system to the Galician oil fields, allowing exploration at previously unheard of depths and speed. The Canadian drilling system sped up the exploration of Galicia's oil fields, and reopened ones thought to have run dry. McGarvey and Bergheim also brought in Canadian drillers and equipment, which commenced a \\"technological revolution in the Galician oil basin.\\" McGarvey and Bergheim struck their first successful well at Waglowka, Western Galicia, about 1885, and by 1887 they began the construction of a refinery at Miariampole. Over the next ten years, McGarvey and Bergheim drilled 370 wells with a total depth of 100,000 meters. By the 1890s, the pair acquired mineral rights all over the province, and on July 4, 1895, McGarvey and Bergheim reorganized their company into a joint- stock company titled Galizische-Karpathen Petroleum Aktien-Gesellschaft. The company's headquarters was in Vienna, with a capital of 10 million crowns. In its first year of operations, the company produced nearly 35 million kilograms of crude oil, and employed roughly 2,400 workers by the end of the century. McGarvey became Manager and Chairman of the Board, spending much of his time in Vienna managing the company. McGarvey's success had turned him into a multimillionaire, and he and his wife often socialized with European aristocrats. In 1908, Emperor Franz Joseph honoured McGarvey in a ceremony at the Vienna Imperial Palace for bringing the Canadian drilling system to Gallica, opening up the Austria oil fields and making the empire a net exporter of oil. In 1912, McGarvey was asked by the British Admiralty to consult on the conversion of its military ships from coal to oil power and in the search for oil in British overseas territory.  Marriage and children  On July 10, 1867, McGarvey married Helena Jane Weslowski of Mount Clemens, Michigan, daughter of a Polish √©migr√© who had been expelled from the Russian Empire for anti-government activity. Together, they had five children: * Nellie Edith McGarvey (1869-1882) * William Edward McGarvey (1871-1872) * Fred McGarvey (1873-1963) * Mary \\"Mamie\\" McGarvey (1876-1961) Maime married Eberhard Friedrich Alexander Joseph Edward Graf von Zeppelin, a nephew of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin in 1895 and divorced him in 1906. * Sarah \\"Kate\\" McGarvey (1883-1934) Kate married Erik Juri√© von Lavandal, an Austrian judge. In 1883, Weslowki and his three living children left Petrolia to join him in Gallica. They lived in a home McGarvey built at Mariampol, Galica. Each of the children attended the finest schools in Austria and Germany.  Final years and death  In December 1897, Helena passed away at her daughter's estate in Graz, Austria. McGarvey remarried in 1905 to Eleanor Hamilton, a British woman. McGarvey's company reached its peak in the early 1910s, becoming one of Europe's largest oil companies. The company's oil refinery at Trieste was one of the largest in Europe and shipped oil products and drilling equipment across the world. A subsidiary company managed drilling operations in Mexico, Cuba, Nigeria, Russia and elsewhere. In early 1911, McGarvey's younger brother James, who managed oil properties at Grosny, Russia was murdered by armed robbers who broke into their home while they were eating dinner. The intruders also killed a servant, a guard, James' colleague Talbot Barnard and wounded a cook, before escaping with 100 pounds in cash. James' wife survived the encounter and was treated at a hospital in Vladikavka. When the First World War broke out, McGarvey was reportedly heartbroken to be living in a nation at war with Britain. In the summer of 1914, Russia invaded Gallica, before being quickly pushed back by Germany and Austria-Hungary. In their retreat, the Russian army set fire to Gallica's oil wells and blew up the refineries, effectively destroying the oil industry in the region and McGarvey's company. Reportedly, Austrian authorities deemed McGarvey suspicious and placed him under house arrest. In November 1914, on his 71st birthday, McGarvey suffered a stroke and died. An obituary in the London Free Press noted that \\"He was thoroughly British and worry is supposed to have hastened his end.\\"  Honours  In 1908, McGarvey was knighted by the emperor of the Austro- Hungarian empire for his contributions to the empire‚Äôs economy. In 1997, McGarvey was inducted into the Canadian Petroleum Hall of Fame for his success as a petroleum magnate in Gallica.

The Battle Shortly after the shelling stopped, the Burundian army began to move in towards the district of Dayniile. Al-Shabab became aware of the army's movements when they were informed by reconnaissance teams, which gave them enough time to prepare for a possible ground assault. When Burundian troops moved in along their tanks and armored personnel carriers, they fell into an ambush by al-Shabab militants where fighting lasted for six full hours, until the military offensive was repulsed. Residents claimed the bodies of 70 soldiers were taken from the battle and brought into al-Shabab-controlled El- Maan area into the town of Alamada, 18 kilometers (11 miles) outside the capital, where the bodies were on public display to journalists and civilians. One witness recalled counted the bodies of 63 Burundian soldiers, all of whom were dead with bullet shots to the head or shoulders, and brought by trucks from Dayniile. No Somalian soldiers were reported killed during the battle, with all the dead coming from Burundian forces. Aftermath In all, during the initial battle al-Shabab claimed they have killed 150 Burundian soldiers but only have the bodies of 76 in their custody, the largest casualty loss for African forces in Somalia.

It was built by Emperor Ashoka (304‚Äì232 BCE) in Pataliputra (modern-day Patna, India), the capital city of the Maurya Empire. The torture palace's legend is detailed in the Ashokavadana, the text that describes Emperor Ashoka's life through both legendary and historical accounts. According to legend, the palatial torture chamber was artfully designed to make its exterior visually pleasing, and was referred to as the \\"beautiful gaol\\". Beneath the veneer of beauty and deep inside the exclusive mansion, however, chambers were constructed filled with sadistic and cruel instruments of torture‚Äîincluding furnaces used to melt the metals that were to be poured on prisoners. The narrative states the chamber's architect drew inspiration from the five tortures of the Buddhist hell. The Ashokavadana describes the torture chamber in such terrifying detail that it spawned a belief that Ashoka‚Äîin his quest to perfect its sinister design‚Äîhad visited hell itself. Through a pact made between Ashoka and the official executioner of the torture chamber anyone entering the palace, even by chance as a visitor, was not allowed to come out alive. Background According to the narrations of Ashokavadana, Emperor Ashoka, prior to his conversion to Buddhism, was a fierce and sadistic ruler, known as Ashoka the Fierce, or Chandashoka (Ashoka the Cruel), who sent his minions on a quest to find a vicious man to work as his official executioner. After some searching, Ashoka's men found a suitable candidate by the name of Girika who was so vicious that he killed his own parents because they did not want him to become Ashoka's executioner. Girika was introduced to Ashoka who soon appointed him as the official executioner of his Empire. Design According to legend, Girika persuaded Ashoka to design the torture chamber based on the suffering endured by people reborn in Buddhist hell. The Ashokavadana documents a long list of torture acts Girika designed and planned to force upon his prisoners including \\"prying open their mouths with an iron and pouring boiling copper down their throats\\". Innocent persons were not exempt from such treatment. In the narrative of Ashokavadana, Ashoka asked Girika to disguise the torture chamber as a beautiful and \\"enticing\\" palace full of amenities such as exclusive baths and to decorate it with flowers, fruit trees and many ornaments. The palatial torture chamber was artfully designed to make people long to just look at it, and even attract them to enter, and was referred to as the \\"beautiful gaol\\". According to the mythology, beneath the veneer of beauty, inside the exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed which were full of the most sadistic and cruel instruments of torture including furnaces producing molten metal for pouring on the prisoners. In the narrative, Ashoka made a pact with Girika that he would never allow anyone who entered the palace to exit alive, including Ashoka himself. The torture chamber was so terrifying, that Emperor Ashoka was thought to have visited hell so that he could perfect its evil design. In the Biographical Sutra of Emperor Ashoka the palace is described by the sentence: 'Emperor Ashoka constructed a hell'. Ashokavadana refers to Girika as Chandagirika or Girika the Cruel. It appears that Girika overheard a Buddhist monk recite the Balapanditasutta which contains vivid descriptions of the five tortures of hell, such as: He got his ideas of how to torture prisoners from there. The text describes Girika's attitude toward punishment as follows: \\"Such are the five great agonies, Girika reflected, and he began to inflict these same tortures on people in his prison\\". In addition, the Balapanditasutta compares the King's torture methods to the tortures of hell. Miracles in the chamber The Ashokavadana further mentions that sometime later a Buddhist monk by the name of Samudra happened to visit the palace and upon entering he was informed by Girika that he would be tortured to death, and was subsequently led into the torture chamber. His torturers, however, failed to injure him and he appeared able to neutralise their torture methods by realising that the suffering of the other prisoners is part of the Buddhist dogma of suffering and attaining arhatship. A particular narration detailed how Samudra, while tortured in a cauldron full of boiling water, human blood, bone marrow and excrement, caused the contents of the cauldron to cool down and then sat meditating cross-legged on a lotus sprouting from the fluid. The narrative further describes that when Ashoka heard of these miracles, he was overcome with curiosity and decided to enter the chamber to verify for himself the veracity of the stories. After arriving there he witnessed Samudra levitating with half his body on fire and the other half raining water. Intrigued he asked Samudra to identify himself. Samudra replied that he was a disciple of Buddha and adherent to the Dharma. Samudra then chastised Ashoka for having built the torture chamber and further instructed him to build 84,000 stupas according to Buddha's prophecy, and to guarantee the security of all beings. To those demands, Ashoka acquiesced. Further, he confessed to his crimes and accepted Buddha and the Dharma. Demolition The Ashokavadana describes the events leading to the demolition of Ashoka's torture chamber. According to the text, the torture chamber had become the site and the reason for his conversion to Buddhism. Girika, as the resident executioner of the chamber, however, reminded Ashoka of his pledge to kill anyone entering the chamber including Ashoka himself. Ashoka then questioned Girika as to who entered the torture palace first during their visit to see Samudra's miracles. Girika was then forced to admit that it was he who entered first. Upon the executioner's confession, Ashoka ordered him burnt alive and also ordered the demolition of the torture palace. According to the Ashokavadana, \\"the beautiful jail was then torn down and a guarantee of security was extended to all beings\\". From that point on, Ashoka became known as Ashoka the Pious. Buddhist monk Xuanzang in his writings mentions that in the 7th century AD he had visited the place where Ashoka's torture chamber once was and that it was, even at that time, referred to in Hindu tradition as \\"Ashoka's Hell\\". Xuanzang also claimed that he saw the column identifying the location of Ashoka's Hell. In India, the palace is known as \\"Ashoka's Hell\\" and its location near Pataliputra became a popular destination for pilgrims. In the 5th century, Faxian, also a Buddhist monk, reports visiting it and his account of the story of the palace differs slightly from that of Xuanzang's. In the 1890s, British explorer Laurence Waddell, while in Patna, established that Agam Kuan, which means the \\"unfathomable well\\", was part of Ashoka's Hell as reported also by the two Chinese monks.

He was able to capture the essence of his subjects with fluidity and sensibility, whether he was using watercolours or ink as his medium. Early life Ran was born in Rat≈ç, Giran- ch≈ç, Japanese Taiwan (modern-day Luodong, Yilan County) in north-eastern Taiwan in 1903. He is said to have painted his first picture at the age of 13, a mural on a temple wall in his home village of a dragon wreathed by cloud. His father, a xiucai scholar of Qing China, is said to have taught Ran Chinese ink painting as a child. He was able to study art at secondary school, and became an art teacher at Rat≈ç Public School at the age of 17. Teaching At this time, Taiwan was a colony of Japan, having been ceded to the Japanese by Qing dynasty China under the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, at the end of the Sino-Japanese war. The Japanese were keen to modernise and develop their new colony of Taiwan, and renowned Japanese watercolour artist Kinichiro Ishikawa spent two periods totalling almost 18 years working and teaching art in Taiwan. In 1924, Ishikawa spotted Ran's watercolours at a school inspection, and was very taken with them. Ran then studied watercolour painting under Ishikawa's tutelage, taking the train to Taihoku (Taipei) at weekends to do so. Ishikawa had studied in England, and taught his students to paint in watercolours in the Western style, which was seen as very important in Japan at that time. Exhibitions Ran successfully exhibited at the Imperial Fine Arts Academy exhibitions in Japan, the Teiten, in 1926 and 1929, and also in 1929, probably owing to Ishikawa's influence with the colonial administration, was appointed as Art teacher at Taihoku First Girls High School and Taihoku Second Girls High School. These were important appointments ‚Äì these schools were generally reserved for privileged Japanese students in Taiwan, and had very few Taiwanese faculty members, let alone someone from a rural area who had only a secondary school education. In the same year, 1929, Ran successfully exhibited in the Japanese Teiten exhibition, with his watercolour On the Street. He also exhibited in Taiwan and was active in furthering watercolour painting in Taiwan, being a founding member of the Taiwan Painting Research Institute for the study of Western painting, established in 1929. Ishikawa taught many students in Taiwan the art of Western style watercolour painting and he mentored and encouraged many Taiwanese students to travel to Japan for further training. Ran, however, stayed in Taiwan and continued to paint in watercolours and also in ink. Legacy Ran's work has been exhibited throughout the world, and his paintings are in the collections of the major museums of the world including the Prado in Madrid and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He was commissioned to paint works in the US and was a member of the major watercolour art societies in the UK, France and Italy. In 1959 he received the National Art Prize from the government of the Republic of China, and in 1969 received an honorary degree from the College of Chinese Culture (now Chinese Culture University) in Taipei. In 1991 the National Palace Museum in Taipei staged a major exhibition of Ran's watercolours, and in 1998 the National Museum of History held a retrospective exhibition of Ran In-ting's work, Hymn of Colors ‚Äì The Art World of Ran In-ting.

Representatives of Hungary and three of its neighbours‚Äîthe so- called \\"Little Entente\\" of Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia‚Äîfirst met at Bled in Yugoslavia on 21 August. The next day, they announced a joint renunciation of the use of force in their mutual relations, and the Little Entente recognised Hungary as having an equal right to armaments. This gave Hungary legal cover for the re-creation of the Hungarian Air Force, already begun in secret, and the increase of its army in manpower, guns, and munitions. Background There had been efforts at rapprochement between Hungary and Czechoslovakia in February and June 1937 in which the latter had asked for a mutual non-aggression pact as part of any deal recognising Hungary's right to re-armament. As this re-armament was already occurring on a limited scale without protest from Czechoslovakia or its allies, Hungary rejected the overtures. Two events convinced the Hungarians to pursue an accord with the Little Entente. One was the Salonika Agreement of 31 July, whereby Bulgaria had obtained permission to re-arm from the members of the Balkan Pact (including Yugoslavia and Romania). The other was Romania's enactment in early August of minority protection statute that was more liberal than Hungary had expected. Thus, although Hungary was willing to negotiate non-aggression and re-armament with the Entente as a unit, it reserved the question of minorities to individual agreements with the member states. The timing of the agreement was related to the scheduled launching of the German cruiser Prinz Eugen by the Hungarian first lady, Magdolna Purgly, on 22 August. The Hungarian government believed that its position toward Germany would be strengthened if it had a pact with the Little Entente completed when officials from both countries met in Kiel for the cruiser's launch. Czechoslovakia's isolation The accord was the biggest piece of international news in the evening papers in London the night of 22 August. It was also praised in the press in France and the Little Entente. It was met with anger by Germany. The actual agreement was complicated and incomplete. Although the question of the Hungarian minority in Romania had been resolved earlier that month, the same question with regards to Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia was still open. On three points of dispute, the Hungarians and the Yugoslavs came to an understanding in separate accords appended to the general accord and initialed but not signed. A final agreement between Hungary and Czechoslovakia on the minority question remained uninitialed because the latter could not satisfy the former's stronger demands. The Czechoslovak foreign minister, Kamil Krofta, informed the Yugoslavs before the conference that although it was \\"a case of discrimination [against us]... we wish to contribute to an agreement\\". The result was that Hungary could come to a general agreement with all three of its neighbours but hold up implementation with respect to only one that also bordered Germany, Czechoslovakia. Only Italy saw the agreement for what it was. The Italian foreign minister, Galeazzo Ciano, remarked that it \\"marked a new phase in the crumbling of the Little Entente. Czechoslovakia is isolated. The French system of friendships is completely upset\\". The Bled conference itself was held without Italy or Austria being consulted and so was in violation of the Rome Protocols agreed to by the three powers in 1934, and of their supplementary agreements made during conferences at Rome (20‚Äì23 March 1936) and Vienna (11‚Äì12 November 1936). (At the latter, Hungary had received recognition that the Little Entente states had an interest in its re-armament.) On 23 August, the Hungarian prime minister, B√©la Imr√©dy, and the Hungarian foreign minister, K√°lm√°n K√°nya, met their German counterparts, Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop, at the naval review in Kiel. The Germans, especially Ribbentrop, were incensed at the recently-published agreement since they were contemplating war with Czechoslovakia. On 25 August in Berlin, Ribbentrop further pressured K√°nya about Hungary's reaction to a German invasion of Czechoslovakia. K√°nya suggested that the Bled agreement could perhaps be invalidated by making demands on the Entente and that Hungary's armed forces would be sufficiently prepared to partake in a Czechoslovak conflict as early as 1 October. Hitler told K√°nya directly that if Hungary wanted to benefit from the partition of Czechoslovakia, it must work towards making that happen: \\"He who wants to sit at the table must at least help in the kitchen\\". Hungary's military would certainly not have been ready to participate in any conflict by October 1, as both governments must have known. Excessive demands The method proposed by K√°nya to the Germans to invalidate the Bled agreement was to \\"make excessive demands on the matter of the [Hungarian] minorities in the Little Entente states\\". On 1 September 1938, in Budapest, Imr√©dy gave an interview to a diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph in which (the Telegraph reported the next morning) he downplayed the significance of the agreement, as it had been reported by the London papers, because its full implementation would come about only when the question of Hungarian minorities had been settled. The Bled agreement contains an early indication of the ebb of the prestige of the League of Nations. The Permanent Council of the Little Entente recognised that \\"in existing circumstances the League of Nations cannot completely carry out the tasks entrusted to it by the authors of the Covenant\\". A communiqu√© of the Yugoslav government, dated 31 August, clarified that Yugoslavia \\"had not renounced her prior obligations\\" by signing the Bled agreement, but Hermann G√∂ring told the Hungarian government on 9 September that the Yugoslav regent, Prince Paul, had assured him that he would \\"in no circumstances intervene against Hungary, not even if the latter got involved in a conflict with Czechoslovakia\\". Hungarian re-armament Almost from its signing, the Treaty of Trianon had been contravened by \\"secret\\" re-armament under tight budgetary constraints. This was general knowledge, and Hungary's neighbours and the great powers looked the other way. The official Hungarian position was that Hungary had a right to re-arm, but the Bled agreement gave it legal cover, and the re-armament programme could shed its nominal secrecy. Even before Trianon, Hungary had begun to plan its secret air force and lay the administrative groundwork. In the 1920s, however, the victorious powers' Aviation Supervisory Committee quashed every effort to circumvent disarmament. In 1932, a plan for a future air force of 48 squadrons was approved. In March 1935, the Director of the Aviation Office, who was de facto commander of the secret air force, urged \\"set[ting] the goal that we become a serious opponent towards at least one of the surrounding Little Entente states\\". By 1 October 1937, the secret air force had reached a strength of 192 planes. As expected, Hungary was not prepared for war by 1 October, but on 6 October all air force units (except for two short-range reconnaissance squadrons) were ordered to ready for deployment. None were ready on time. In the end, the air force was not needed, as the Italo-German mediated First Vienna Award solved Hungary's revisionist claims on Czechoslovakia without war. There was conflict within the government over command of the air force until, on 1 January 1939, it was finally proclaimed a separate branch of the armed forces. It received its baptism of fire in the brief war with Slovakia from 23 March to 4 April.

The African chameleon or Sahel chameleon (Chamaeleo africanus) is a species of chameleon native to the Sahel and Nile Valley, with an introduced population present in Greece. An average size may be around long, including its tail.  Range  Chamaeleo africanus is found in much of the Sahel, from Mali and Mauritania to Sudan. Its range also extends north along the Nile to Egypt, although it might have been introduced there. From Egypt, the species has been brought to the Peloponnese. It lives in dry savanna.  Description  The African chameleon is a slow-moving, laterally flattened species growing to a maximum length of . It has bulbous eyes which can move independently of each other and a prehensile tail. It is very similar in appearance to the common chameleon (Chamaeleo chamaeleon) but has no flaps at the back of its head and is rather larger. It is often green with many black spots, but like other chameleons, is capable of changing its colour. It has a large bony casque on its head. It has long limbs, and the male has tarsal spurs. Behaviour The African chameleon is usually found on the lower branches of trees, on shrubs and on reeds (Phragmites). It grasps its support with its four-toed feet, a pair of toes on either side of the branch, and its tail, and remains stationary or advances slowly and stealthily. It feeds mainly on insects which it catches by suddenly extending its sticky- tipped tongue. It may also eat small lizards or fledgling birds. The female descends to the ground to breed and lays a clutch of up to seventy eggs in an underground nest. These take about three months to hatch and the young chameleons take a year or more to reach maturity.

The episode was written by Andy Bobrow and directed by Tristram Shapeero. The episode features the study group gathering around for Christmas at Jeff's apartment as they try to convince their history professor to change their grade. Malcolm McDowell guest-stars as Professor Cornwallis. Plot Jeff (Joel McHale) hosts a Christmas party for the study group at his apartment. After learning they failed their last history paper, Annie (Alison Brie) secretly invites their professor, Noel Cornwallis (Malcolm McDowell), and hopes to convince him to raise their grade. Jeff confesses to Britta (Gillian Jacobs) that he blew off his section but is still confused as to how they failed. Cornwallis quickly realizes the group is sucking up and reasons they are seeking to boost the C- from their paper. Jeff confronts Annie about why she said they \\"failed\\" with a C-; Annie explains the grade is not good enough for her as she tries to become valedictorian. After overhearing Jeff's rants, Cornwallis changes the grade to an F. While the group privately discusses what happened, Chang (Ken Jeong) ties Cornwallis to a chair in a misguided attempt to help them. The group decides to use the situation to negotiate with Cornwallis for a higher grade. Cornwallis employs mind games to get the group to turn on each other and release him. He offers an A to whoever unties him, with the rest getting an F, and seeks to use the group's romantic entanglements to his advantage. Cornwallis also reveals that the student on track for valedictorian is Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown). Despite the temptation of undermining Shirley's grades by taking the A, Annie refuses to untie Cornwallis. Their conversation is interrupted by Dean Pelton's (Jim Rash) arrival at the door. After the Dean leaves, the group realizes Cornwallis has been untied. Cornwallis taunts that one of them freed him, but Jeff gives a speech explaining that the group will not turn on each other because they are all constantly making mistakes and forgiving each other. When Cornwallis continues with his taunts, the group ties him up again. However, when the group sees Chang's poorly wrapped gifts, they realize he could not have actually tied up Cornwallis in the first place. Cornwallis relents and admits he staged everything because their party provided a respite from his loneliness. He gives the group a C+, and they continue with the party. Later, Chang leaves to call someone unknown, revealing that his plan to have the group expelled failed. The end tag shows the Darkest Timeline. There, Jeff convinces a judge to free Annie from Greendale Asylum, and the pair plot to invade the prime timeline.

This is the first episode aired of season four to not feature Chevy Chase (Pierce) in either onscreen or voice parts. Although aired as episode ten, it was the ninth episode produced. Reception Ratings The episode was seen by approximately 3.13 million viewers when it premiered, and increased 10% in viewership from the previous episode, and became the most- watched episode of the season since episode five. Critical reception Cory Barker of TV.com gave the episode a mixed review, saying \\"It offered some initial intrigue that it wasn't totally able to follow through with, then overcame that initial wave of disappointment with a strong middle, only to end on a lamer note. It wasn't a complete mess by any means, but it squandered more potential than I would have liked.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated it a B-, but said, \\"This episode [...] tries to cram everything it can think of into the same show, when more simplicity would have led to a stronger episode overall.\\" References External links * \\"Intro to Knots\\" at NBC.com * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Community (season 4) episodes Category:Christmas television episodes ","title":"Intro to Knots"},{"id":"39153927","text":"River Lake may refer to: *River Lake (Winter Haven, Florida), a lake in the U.S. See also *River Lake (Nova Scotia), a list of lakes in Canada *Lake River, a river in the U.S. ","title":"River Lake"},{"id":"39153929","text":"John Lorimer (1732‚Äì1795) was an American surgeon, mathematician, politician and cartographer in the 18th Century.

Etymology Kharadar literally means Brackish Gate in both Sindhi and Urdu.CITIES: A KARACHI BY ANY OTHER NAME by Sibtain Naqvi, Dawn Newspaper, July 30, 2017 Location Kharadar is located in central Karachi, near the Port of Karachi. Together with the adjacent community of Mithadar, it forms what is regarded as the original core of Karachi, when the city was known as \\"Kalachi Jo Goath.\\" The combined area of the two is approximately 35 square kilometers. History The Wazir Mansion, birthplace of Pakistan's founder Muhammed Ali Jinnah is located in Kharadar The neighbourhood was named after one of two gates to the old city of Karachi built in 1729 ‚Äì the other being Mitha Dar or \\"Sweet Gate,\\" (referring to the potable, fresh water of the Lyari River) which is now the name of the neighborhood adjacent to the northern edge of Kharadar. Both gates were torn down in 1860 after the British conquered Sindh 13 years earlier. Economy Kharadar, along with Mithadar, is a center for Karachi's textile industry, with several garment factories and wholesalers located in the adjacent Bolton Markets, as well as numerous textile markets along Laxmi Das Street.

One of the earliest Ismailis in Kharadar was Syed Ghulam Ali Shah, or \\"Ghulmali Shah\\" of the Kadiwala clan, was a prominent missionary in Sindh, Kutch and Kathiawar. He died in Karachi in 1792 when there were only a handful Ismailis. Rather than being buried amongst a small community, his body was transported to Kera in Gujarat for burial. The Ismaili community grew rapidly following a famine in Kutch in 1820, during which 250 Ismailis families fled the area to settle in Kharadar, where they built their first house of worship in the Kagzi Bazar (\\"Paper Market\\") in 1825. The area housed the headquarters of the Ismaili faith in Pakistan, until they were moved north to Garden. Kharadar also has a large Memon community.

He was the stepfather of Sir Matthew Brend, owner of the Globe Theatre, and during the years 1624-7 was himself the effective owner of the Globe. Family The Zinzan family is said to have come to England from Italy. Beginning with Sir Robert, members of the family frequently used the surname 'Alexander'.. Sigismund Zinzan was a younger son of Robert Zinzan (c.1547‚Äì1607), an equerry in the royal stables during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. In 1585 the Queen sent Robert Zinzan to the court of King James in Scotland with a gift of horses.. Between the years 1565 and 1591 he was a regular participant in tournaments at court.. On 3 July 1593 he asked Lord Burghley to make him surveyor of the refiners of sugar, in accordance with similar grants made to others such as that to Dr Lopez for aniseed;. some months later, in April 1594, Zinzan and a fellow equerry, Richard Mompesson, were granted a monopoly to import anise seeds and sumac for twenty years. He was knighted by King James (as 'Robert Alexander') at Whitehall on 23 July 1603.; . Sir Robert Zinzan died in 1607, at which time his son, Henry, succeeded him in his office of brigandery (supplier of body armour). The first name of Sir Sigismund Zinzan's mother was Margaret according to his father's will; her father was surnamed Westcote,With the marriage of the heiress Elizabeth Littleton to Thomas Westcote, esquire, two of Elizabeth's sons, Edmund, who died without issue, and Sir Thomas Littleton, the celebrated author of Littleton's Tenures, took the surname Lyttleton or Littleton, while two others, Nicholas and Guy, retained the earlier surname; Nicholas Westcote married Agnes Vernon, the daughter and heiress of Edmund Vernon, and was ancestor of the Westcotes of Staffordshire; ; . was an esquire, and resided at Handsacre Hall in Staffordshire. Zinzan had two brothers, Robert Zinzan, who died without issue, and Henry Zinzan alias Alexander, and three sisters, Mary, Dulcibella, and another sister who first name is unknown.. Career Like his father, Sigismund Zinzan was an equerry to Queen Elizabeth I, and both he and his brother Henry participated in tournaments at court during the final years of the Queen's reign. On 27 June 1603 George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, put on an entertainment for the new King, James I, at Grafton Regis, in which the two Zinzan brothers ran at tilt, as recorded by Clifford's daughter, Lady Anne Clifford:. > From thence (Hatton Fermor's) the court removed, and was banqueted with > great royalty by my father at Grafton, where the King and Queen were > entertained with speeches and delicate presents, at which time my Lord and > the Alexanders did run a course at the field, where he hurt Henry Alexander > very dangerously.Jessica L. Malay, Anne Clifford's Autobiographical Writing, > 1590-1676 (Manchester, 2018), p. 20. The Zinzan brothers participated regularly in tournaments throughout King James's reign, and were tilting partners of the King's sons, Henry and Charles. During the years 1608-1624 they received ¬£100 from the Exchequer for each tournament in which they participated; a warrant of 7 March 1619, for example, awarded them ¬£100 'for their charges of their running at tilt' on the King's Accession Day, 24 March. Young speculates that these payments may have been granted them because they played a role in organizing the tilts. Henry Zinzan took part in tournaments over a period of twenty-seven years; he eventually petitioned the Crown for financial relief, citing as a reason his 'long service' and the 'extreme hurts he has received by Prince Henry and His Majesty'.; . In the fall of 1609 Sigismund Zinzan was fined ¬£500 in the Court of Star Chamber for causes which are not now known.. On 4 June 1610, King James' had his fifteen-year-old son and heir, Henry, created Prince of Wales 'with extraordinary pomp and solemnity'. The next day Ben Jonson's Masque of Oberon was performed, and on 6 June there was a tournament in which the Zinzan brothers were among the tilters: > The third and last day did not give place unto any of the former, either in > stateliness of shew or sumptuousness in performance. The names of the > tilters were these: the Duke of Lennox, the Earls of Arundel, Pembroke, > Dorset and Montgomery; the Lords Walden, Compton, Norris, North, Hay and > Dingwell; Sir Thomas Somerset, Sir Thomas Howard, Sir Henry Carey, Sir > Sigismond Alexander and Mr Henry Alexander.. When Prince Henry died on 6 November 1612 at the age of eighteen, Sigismund Zinzan led a horse trapped with black cloth in the funeral procession.; . Zinzan was outlawed for debt on four occasions, three times in 1612 and once in 1691. The Zinzan brothers, along with the future King Charles I, are listed among those who tilted on 24 March 1620 in honour of King James' Accession Day.. The last Accession Day tilt for the brothers was in 1624; King James died in 1625, and tilting on Accession Day was thereafter banned by his successor, Charles I.. In 1605 Zinzan had married Margaret Brend, the widow of Nicholas Brend, owner of the land on which the Globe Theatre was built. During the time her son, Matthew Brend, was underage, Margaret had not received the one-third of the income from her late husband's lands to which she was entitled, and in the summer of 1623 Zinzan and Brend agreed upon terms for payment to Margaret of the sums owing to her.. However this settlement was almost immediately revised in September of that year when Matthew Brend was required to provide a jointure for his bride to be, Frances Smith. A new agreement was then reached under which Brend granted Margaret a life estate in his properties in Southwark, including the land on which the Globe Theatre was built.. In the late fall of 1624, pursuant to this agreement, Zinzan became effective owner of the Globe in right of his wife, and continued to be so for a period of more than two years, despite lawsuits filed against him in Chancery by Brend. According to Berry, Zinzan and Brend eventually negotiated a settlement, and in any event Zinzan's interest in the Globe by reason of his wife's dower rights came to an end when Margaret Zinzan died at some time prior to 20 June 1627.. There were other frictions between Zinzan and his stepson. In 1624-5 Brend alleged that Zinzan had harvested valuable timber on the family estate in West Molesey during the nineteen-year period during which Zinzan had been 'master' there. Zinzan denied the charge, claiming he had taken only a few pollarded trees to repair buildings on the property, and for use as palings for fences.. From 1624-7 Zinzan campaigned intermittently in the Low Countries. In the summer of 1624 he had a command there as captain under Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, at a salary of ¬£15 a month.. His service was interrupted for eighteen months in 1625-6 at the command of Prince Charles, who required him in England. He returned to the Low Countries, but ceased campaigning about mid-1627.. In 1628, beset by debts, Zinzan petitioned the King for financial relief. He was granted a pension of ¬£100 a year, to commence at Christmas in 1631, and to continue so long as the King saw fit.. During the English Civil War, Zinzan was not with the forces fighting on the King's side. Instead, he joined the Parliamentary forces of the Earl of Essex, serving in a regiment of cavalry under Arthur Goodwin during the years 1642-3. In August 1654 Zinzan petitioned Oliver Cromwell for financial relief, claiming 'extremity of poverty' and that he was owed money by the Crown for service under the Earl of Essex. The Crown's records did not support his claim, but he was nonetheless awarded a pension of 20s a week, to commence 10 May 1655. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, King Charles II renewed Zinzan's pension of 20s, but Zinzan did not live to collect it; he died about mid-July 1661 at over ninety years of age.. Marriage and issue About 1605.

History The company was founded in 1952 by two Danish craftsmen and cabinet makers, Jens √Ürth√∏j and Tage M√∏lholm. The first pieces of furniture to leave the factory were cabinets made of oak veneer with a mid-section of walnut. In 1954, the owners and the four employees moved into their new furniture factory '√Ürth√∏j-Jensen and M√∏lholm M√∏belfabrik'. The functionalism sweeping through Danish design during the 50s played an important influence on the designs from √Ürth√∏j-Jensen and M√∏lholm. As industrial pioneers of their time, the founders in 1962 opened a new 1300m2 factory in Herning where the company is still located. In 1976, the company changed its name to Denka with a view to conquer the international markets. The collections were now also designed to suit the individual tastes of different markets, and the furniture were now what you can all 'customized to the market'.

This acquisition of silk worms from China allowed the Byzantines to have a monopoly of silk in Europe. Background Silk worms Silk, which was first produced sometime during the fourth millennium BC by the Chinese, was a valuable trade commodity along the Silk Road. By the first century AD, there was a steady flow of silk into the Roman Empire. With the rise of the Sassanid Empire and the subsequent Roman-Persian Wars, importing silk to Europe became increasingly difficult and expensive. The Persians strictly controlled trade in their territory and would suspend trade in times of war.Norwich, John (1988), Byzantium: The Early Centuries pg. 265 Consequently, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I tried creating alternative trade routes to Sogdiana, which at the time had become a major silk-producing centre:Clare, Israel (1906), Library of Universal History: Mediaeval History pg. 1590 one to the north via Crimea, and one to the south via Ethiopia.Norwich, pg. 266 The failure of these efforts led Justinian I to look elsewhere. Expedition Mosaic of Justinian I Two unidentified monks (most likely members of the Nestorian Church) who had been preaching Christianity in India (Church of the East in India), made their way to China by 551 AD.Clare, pg. 1589 While they were in China, they observed the intricate methods for raising silk worms and producing silk. This was a key development, as the Byzantines had previously thought silk was made in India.Clare, pg. 1587 In 552 AD, the two monks sought out Justinian I. In return for his generous but unknown promises, the monks agreed to acquire silk worms from China. They most likely traveled a northern route along the Black Sea, taking them through the Transcaucasus and the Caspian Sea. Since adult silkworms are rather fragile and have to be constantly kept at an ideal temperature, lest they perish,The Smithsonian on Silk Production they used their contacts in Sogdiana to smuggle out silkworm eggs or very young larvae instead, which they hid within their bamboo canes. Mulberry bushes, which are required for silkworms, were either given to the monks or already imported into the Byzantine Empire. All in all, it is estimated that the entire expedition lasted two years.Silk Museum of Lebanon Impact Byzantine silk Shortly after the expedition there were silk factories in Constantinople, Beirut, Antioch, Tyre, and Thebes. The acquired silk worms allowed the Byzantine Empire to have a silk monopoly in Europe. The acquisition also broke the Chinese and Persian silk monopolies. The resulting monopoly was a foundation for the Byzantine economy for the next 650 years until its demise in 1204.Muthesius, Anna (2003), Silk in the Medieval World pg. 326 Silk clothes, especially those dyed in imperial purple, were almost always reserved for the elite in Byzantium, and their wearing was codified in sumptuary laws. Silk production in the region around Constantinople, particularly in Thrace in northern Greece, has continued to the present.

A batch of letters was found in her coffin which might explain why they never married but out of respect for the deceased they have not been read. The rood screen (1695) bears Knuth's arms with a black kettle hook. The painting on the altarpiece is by Constantin Hansen (1833). The pulpit is from 1862. On the north wall of the chancel there is an epitaph to Peder Oxe who died in 1575. It was completed before his death and although he was buried in Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, the date of his death has been added. The epitaph states that Braaby Church has been moved to Gisselfeld. This never happened but he was so convinced that his plans would be carried out and the church would be moved stone by stone that he included it in his epitaph. Baptismal font (detail). Gotland limestone has been used to make the font from the later part of the 12th century. It is akin to the font seen in Bornholm, though the decorations are different; these are inferred to be by an artist of Zealand. The bowl of the font has decorations made in relief. They depict the Three Kings and Saint Anne holding the baby Jesus. Also seen in the relief are other scenes of an angel restraining a hunter, a deer, a cross turned towards the hunter, satan in the form of an ape, and horses saddled but without the riders, the central horse carrying a falcon.

History The red-brick church was probably built in or shortly after 1492 when King Hans transferred the site into the ownership of Copenhagen University. The masonry, however, contains traces of an earlier Romanesque limestone structure, probably daing from Valdemar Atterdag's reign. Architecture Today's late Gothic building, in length, has a brick nave with limestone trimmings. On the south wall, the pointed arch of a now bricked-up door can be seen, probably once the priest's entrance. The tower was built at the same time as the nave or shortly afterwards. Its east gable has nine narrow blank windows of varying heights and three Gothic windows which have been bricked in. Decorations in the form of limestone belts reach the level of the roof on the eastern side but have been less systematically completed elsewhere, perhaps indicating rushed construction work.

When the professional Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) started in 2001, Roseli and compatriot Pretinha were assigned to Washington Freedom in the inaugural draft. Washington performed poorly in their first season and bought out Roseli's contract after she failed to score in 11 appearances, only three of which were starts.

An old grave containing two skeletons was discovered, possibly dating from a former wooden church. The chancel was rebuilt in yellow brick with a semi-circular apse. Interior The granite font in the Romanesque style has rope-like framing around 11 rounded segments and a thicker rope decoration just above the base. The decorated baptismal bowl from c. 1550 was created at the Nuremberg workshop. The high Renaissance altarpiece from c. 1600 is in fir, its wing decorations flanking the text of the Lord's Prayer. The more recent headpiece contains a picture of the Resurrection. The Renaissance pulpit and its canopy are the work of artists from N√¶stved. The chancel was fully restored and repainted in 1989.\\"Freerselv Church\\", Visit Denmark. Retrieved 24 April 2013.\\"Freerslev Kirke\\", Kirker i Danmark. Retrieved 24 April 2013.

History Barrie began thinking about becoming involved in movie production when producer Mike Frankovich asked Faberg√© to make a mock advertisement for a scene in his film of The Love Machine. Barrie made an advertisement for a perfume, Xanadu. Sales of this shot up as a result of it being in the film. The company began in March 1972. Cary Grant was on the board of directors and Roger Moore was an ambassador at large. Barrie said in July 1972 \\"We're not in business just for Cary or Roger to make the films they want.\\" \\"It's a diversification of Faberg√© and is strictly commercial\\", said Moore. Brut initially announced they would make five features and four TV productions. The features were Hugo the Hippo, then being filmed; Night Watch with Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey; A Touch of Class with Glenda Jackson; The Book of Numbers; and Getting Rid of Mr Straker with Roger Moore. The four TV productions were The Protectors with Robert Vaughn and Nyree Dawn Porter; Anita in Jumbo Land with Anita Harris; Rexford with Glenn Stanley; and The Whistling Wizard, a Bil Baird puppet show. (Brut did not make the TV productions, they just distributed them in America.) The company decided to move into distribution as well. First films In October 1972 the company announced they were moving to Los Angeles and that Martin Rackin was appointed senior vice president. The first three films they financed were Nightwatch, A Touch of Class and Book of Numbers. They were working on an animated musical in Hungary, Hugo the Hippo and paid $500,000 to distribute Count Your Bullets. Barri wanted to move into television production and music, including their own music label. Avco Embassy agreed to distribute the features . Production of Getting Rid of Mr Straker was postponed when Roger Moore was cast of James Bond. The company financed Miracles Still Happen and Welcome to Arrow Beach. The company had an early big success with A Touch of Class. In October 1973 Sammy Cahn joined as a creative consultant. In December Ross Hunter was appointed president. He signed a distribution agreement with Warner Bros. Struggles However Hunter left in April 1974. George Barrie moved into producing with Whiffs. Later films performed less well at the box office. Brut suffered losses from 1975 onwards. They made two TV movies, Sweet Hostage and Baby Maker. Final years and current ownership status Faberg√© reported in 1981 the company lost them in $5.4 million. Faberg√© sold their interest in 17 films in 1982 for an undisclosed amount to the Turner Broadcasting System.

The oldest parts of the church were built in the 12th century but today's structure is the result of its rebuilding in 1916. History The first church in Haslev was probably a wooden structure built in the 11th century although nothing remains of it today. In the 12th century, limestone was used to build a small church, long and wide, with a nave, a chancel and an apse. Its foundations were discovered during the reconstruction work from 1914 to 1916.\\"Haslev kirke i fortid og nutid\\", Haslev Kirke. Retrieved 19 April 2013.\\"Haslev kirke\\", Nordens Kirker. Retrieved 19 April 2013. In the 13th century, the building was extended to the west. The apse was removed and the chancel was extended to the east. The rounded window on the north side dates from this period. During comprehensive rebuilding in the 14th century, the width was extended to 9 metres and a new roof with three cross vaults was added, meeting the prevailing standards. At the beginning of the 15th century, a new stepped gable was built at the eastern end, a sacristy was added to the north and a porch to the south, reflecting the Gothic style of the times. The tower, high, was added in the mid-14th century while a chapel was built on the north side at the end of the century. Pulput (1579) In 1870, Haslev became a railway town, attracting many new inhabitants. The architect H. L√∏nborg-Jensen planned an extension which consisted of building a new church which crossed transversely through the old one. The old church thus became a parallel aisle in the new cross-shaped structure and the old chancel became the east entrance. The new building with seating for 641 and an altar to the south was consecrated on 2 April 1916. Interior The carved wooden pulpit from 1579 is one of the oldest in Denmark. In 1967 it was restored and repainted by the National Museum. The canopy came later in 1640. The old decorated pews from the mid-16th century have been preserved. The seats decorated with the arms of the counts of Bregentved are particularly impressive. The organ, with 36 stops, was built in 1978 by Poul Gerhard Andersen, one of the leading organ builders of his day. The font, completed in 1935, was built in accordance with plans prepared by the church's architect L√∏nborg-Jensen.

History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1589 when a stave church was located on the site. It is not known when that building was constructed. Possible burial mounds from the Viking Age dating back to around 1000 are located near the church. An addition was added to the building in 1648. A few years later, another addition added to the size of the building. In 1703, a new sacristy was built on the east side of the building. In 1727, the building was deemed to be in need of replacement. It was torn down that year and replaced with the present Y-shaped building on the same site in 1728.

Its founder and president, Lisa Price, established the brand in 1993 in Brooklyn, New York. The brand was named after Lisa Price's mother, Carol. The beauty brand offers a range of hair, body, and skincare products. In October 2014, the brand was acquired by L‚ÄôOr√©al USA. History Price started the brand as a \\"side hustle\\" from her kitchen table in Brooklyn, New York in the late 1980s. It initially started as a hobby while she was working full-time in television production, notably on \\"The Cosby Show\\" and its spin- off \\"Here and Now\\". She first began experimenting with fragrances and essential oils, which grew into an exploration of body care products. After gifting the homemade products to friends and family, her mother, Carol, implored her to start a business. Her mother died in 2003. In 1993, Price began selling her products through word-of-mouth in her Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, and at local flea markets and craft fairs, building- up a loyal, devoted customer base. The first Carol's Daughter boutique opened in Fort Greene, Brooklyn in 1999. In 2000, the brand launched its e-commerce website. In 2002, Price was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show, which gave her brand an enormous \\"Oprah Effect\\" boost. In 2005, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Jay-Z were among a group of movie and music stars who invested $10 million USD into Price's brand to help expand its nationwide reach. Other investors included record executive Steve Stoute, investor Andrew Farkas, Interscope Records chief Jimmy Iovine, and music executive Tommy Mottola and his wife, singer Thalia. In 2008, Carol's Daughter launched on HSN. In 2010, HSN partnered with Mary J. Blige and Carol's Daughter for an exclusive, inaugural fragrance called \\"My Life\\", which rolled-out with an eau de parfum in a limited edition gold clutch, a shower cream, a body lotion, and an eau de parfum rollerpen. In March 2014, Carol's Daughter launched an exclusive collection with Target. In April 2014, the brand filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the Manhattan bankruptcy court. The brand's chief financial officer, John D. Elmer, stated that most of Carol's Daughter stores had been unprofitable since 2010. Before filing papers, the company closed five of its seven retail stores, and terminated 29 of its 42 employees. Six months later, in October 2014, Carol's Daughter was acquired by L‚ÄôOr√©al USA.

The exhibits will reflect the rich ethnic diversity of the County.\\"Museum History at official website. Funding for the project came from increased public revenues derived from casino gambling in Tunica County.Matt Volz, \\"Casinos renew life along river, Associated Press in The Daily Gazette, December 21, 2003. Permanent exhibits The first exhibits trace the history of Tunica County. The first room looks like a forest and has several examples of wildlife indigenous to the area. These include birds, bobcats, and a lifesize black bear. An exhibit of the mound building Indians, including the Tunica people, is next. There are panels that describe the life and activities of the Indians, and there is also a television that plays continually a short documentary about the Indians. One particular excavation site, the Hollywood site, is given special attention, including mention of the work done by the University of Mississippi's archaeology department. Tunica was changed by European contact, and the museum describes the early exploration by the Spanish. The exhibit argues that Tunica County was the probable place where Hernando de Soto first sighted the Mississippi River. This is based on the descriptions of the place as described by members of DeSoto's party. This topic has been a source of debate for many years.7 There is a life-size conquistador, demonstrating the typical appearance of the early Spanish explorers. Northern Mississippi, including Tunica County, belonged to the Chickasaw tribe through the colonial days and the first years of the new American republic. An exhibit details the Chickasaw cession (Treaty of 1818) made final with the Treaty of Pontotoc. With this cession's description, the exhibits move into the settlement of the region under the government of the State of Mississippi. Exhibits describe how the Tunica County was denuded and turned into farm land, including several large plantations. The land was excellent for farming. As part of the Mississippi Delta, the soil had been enriched by constant flooding of the Mississippi River. This section includes a full size mule and wagon, a real plantation bell, and a recreated plantation commissary. There are also several display related to the widespread use of slavery in Tunica. Post-Civil War exhibits begin with the implementation of Jim Crow laws in Tunica. Stories of white violence during and post- Reconstruction are told, with special attention to a racist group known as the Red Shirts (Southern United States). Issues related to agriculture are examined, including the fight against the boll weevil, the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, and the loss of field hands due to the Great Migration. Daily life in Tunica up to modern times was shown with displays that included parts of a barbershop and movie theater. Tunica County has faced the persistence of poverty. A display recounts the national attention received from living conditions in Sugar Ditch, a poverty-stricken neighborhood in the city limits of Tunica. The Reverend Jesse Jackson's activities related to Sugar Ditch are part of the display. In 1992, casino gambling came to Tunica County, when Splash Casino opened. The impact on Tunica County is the subject of another display that includes a slot machine and a casino card table. This section includes a television playing a short documentary related to casinos. With the conclusion of the historical exhibits, there are several other displays. These include a cotton bale and samples of rice, soybeans, and corn directly from the farm fields. One board shows notable people from Tunica County, along with a description of what they did. The last part of the Tunica museum includes numerous stuffed animals found in Tunica, especially large birds. Themes *The issue of race. From slavery to segregation to current racial issues, the reality of racial tension is explored by the museum. *The importance of the land and climate. Tunica's economic activities have been ties to agriculture and the farming of the southern United States. *The daily lives of Tunica County residents. Other exhibits and activities The Museum also operates the Tate Log House, which is the oldest structure in the county. It is open for viewing and is located within downtown Tunica. It demonstrates the early living conditions within the county.Mary Cashiola, \\"Quiet Time in Tunica: Casinos aren't the only game in this town.\\", Memphis Flyer, June 15, 2006.

This algorithm preprocesses the string being searched for the pattern, which is similar to Boyer‚ÄìMoore string-search algorithm. The searching pattern of particular sub- string in a given string is different from Boyer‚ÄìMoore‚ÄìHorspool algorithm. This algorithm was published by Timo Raita in 1991.RAITA T., 1992, Tuning the Boyer‚ÄìMoore‚ÄìHorspool string searching algorithm, Software - Practice & Experience, 22(10):879-884  Description  Raita algorithm searches for a pattern \\"P\\" in a given text \\"T\\" by comparing each character of pattern in the given text. Searching will be done as follows. Window for a text \\"T\\" is defined as the length of \\"P\\". # First, last character of the pattern is compared with the rightmost character of the window. # If there is a match, first character of the pattern is compared with the leftmost character of the window. # If they match again, it compares the middle character of the pattern with middle character of the window. If everything in the pre-check is successful, then the original comparison starts from the second character to last but one. If there is a mismatch at any stage in the algorithm, it performs the bad character shift function which was computed in pre-processing phase. Bad character shift function is identical to the one proposed in Boyer‚ÄìMoore‚ÄìHorspool algorithm. A modern formulation of a similar pre-check is found in , a linear/quadratic string-matcher, in libc++ and libstdc++.

The mouths of several rivers debouch at Norton Bay, including the Kwik, Kwiniuk, and Tubutulik rivers. The name Norton was assigned in 1859 by the Coast Survey. Norton Bay and Norton Sound were discovered as one entity by Captain James Cook in 1778, and named after Sir Fletcher Norton (who later became Lord Grantley), who was the speaker of the House of Commons of Great Britain. Geography The north shore of the bay is in front of the Kwiktalik Mountain () in Seaward Peninsula. The Reindeer Hills lie on the Southhead of the Bay. Cape Nome is at the entrance to the bay. Circa 1902, there were several Alaska Native villages on the northern shore of the Norton Bay: Kviguk and Kwik villages. The streams joining the north shore of the bay are Kvingak, Kwik, Kwiniuk, and also Tubutulik River (an Inuktitut name given in 1849 by Temenkof). Captain Mikhail Dmitrievich Tebenkov was the director of the Russian American Company and Governor of Russian America during 1845-50. In 1831, he visited the Norton Sound and discovered the bay that bears his name. Geology The inference, based on field studies, is that the Nulato-Norton Bay region evolved during the Cretaceous period. It is seen in the form of old deposits of conglomerates, sandstone and shales in the middle of the basin. Placer gold Placer gold deposits are very few in the Nulato-Norton Bay area in some pockets of Cretaceous and Tertiary deposits) as compared to the finds in the Nome area. Some of the streams such as the Kwintuk, Tubutulik and Kwik which flow into the bay have placer gold and the sediment flow discharged into the bay could also be a source of gold in the bay. Aqua fauna Marine and other species reported from the bay have been a source of sustenance for the people of the area. The species reported are tomcod (a small fish) and herring. The hair of the seals caught from the bay area were woven into a fur cloth and the skin of the ogruk, a thick skinned seal, was used for making footwear worn by the Mukluk inhabitants of the area. Walrus has also been found is during the spring season which are caught and used as food. Landmarks Archaeological site of Iyatayet Site The National Historic Landmark Iyatayet Site is located on the northwest shore of Cape Denbigh on Norton Bay. Its historicity lies in the fact the Norton Culture dated between 500 BC and 300 AD existed at this site, in stratified deposits above the Denbigh Flint Complex of 6000-4000 BC. Remnants of artifacts found here have further added to the relationship that existed with the cultures of the Paleolithic and Mesolithic ages. In 1840, at the mouth of Ukaliik River, part of the Norton Bay, a fort and a trading town (named after the river) had been established. Nature Reserve The Norton Bay Nature Reserve was established in 1917 covering an area of about for use by the US Bureau of Education and the Natives of the Indigenous Alaskan race. The area extends over a length of to the south east of Nome and covers the coastal area of Norton Bay. This area has the burial grounds of a large number of Eskimo natives who died due to epidemic diseases.

Working in Germany, her career started to unravel in 1933 due to her Jewish ancestry.Kressley RA, Jaeger S. 2003. Rediscovering a missing link: The sensory physiologist and comparative psychologist Mathilde Hertz (1891-1975). History of Psychology 6(4): 379-396. DOI:10.1037/1093-4510.6.4.379 She was the younger daughter of the famous physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. Biography Mathilde Hertz was born on January 14, 1891 in Bonn, Germany. Her father Rudolf Hertz died in 1894 when Mathilde Hertz was still very young. Hertz was born into a wealthy and well-educated family. After finishing secondary schooling, she received training in fine arts and worked as a sculptor. One of her first jobs involved reconstructing fossilized teeth at the German Museum. Ludwig Doederlein noticed her work and encouraged her to enroll at the University of Munich for doctoral studies in 1921. In 1925 she completed a doctoral degree based on the analysis of primitive mammalian teeth.Hertz M. 1925. Beobachtungen an Primitiven Saeugetiergebissen. Zeitschrift f√ºr Morphologie und √ñkologie der Tiere 4: 540-584 Once finished with her dissertation, she focused her attention on a different area. Influenced by renowned animal psychologist Wolfgang Koehler, she moved into the area of animal psychology. She moved to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, Germany, where she undertook much of her subsequent studies. With the help of Richard Goldschmidt, she overcame gender barriers and started running her own laboratory in Berlin. Here, in 1929, she completed a post-doctoral degree studying the optical fields of honeybees.Satzinger H. 2009. Differenz und Vererbung. Cologne, Germany: Boehlau Wolfgang Koehler was one of her post-doctoral committee members. Hertz continued laboratory work and lecturing after her post-doc until her career began to unravel in 1933. Under the newly elected Nazi regime, she was forced to give up teaching due to her Jewish ancestry. Both Max Planck and Wolfgang Koehler spoke out for her and so she was allowed to continue laboratory work for a few years.MacRakies K. 1993. Surviving the Swastika: Scientific Research in Nazi Germany. New York, USA: Oxford University Press After turning down an offer from Columbia University to come to the United States, she emigrated to the United Kingdom and continued her research at Cambridge University in 1935. In England, however, she was more known for her famous father and not so much for her own work.Jaeger, S. (1996).

Pp. 229-262 After only two years at Cambridge University she stopped publishing and disappeared from the public spotlight. Unwilling to accept charity based on her family ties, she died in poverty in 1975. Work Mathilde Hertz concentrated on primitive mammalian teeth for her doctoral thesis. Once she received her doctoral degree, however, Hertz moved away from studying teeth and focused on animal psychology. She initially concentrated on the behavior of ravens.Hertz M. 1926. Beobachtungen an Gefangenen Raubvoegeln. Psychologische Forschung 8: 336-397 She was specifically interested in the visual perception of these birds. Her findings are valued for many reasons. Among others, she published important findings explaining problem-solving in animals.Duncker K, Lees L. 1945. On problem-solving. Psychological Monographs 58(5): i-113 In the years following, she focused primarily on the visual perception of honeybees Other animals she studied include blue jays, hermit crabs, and flies. Family legacy Mathilde Hertz, who herself never had children, came from a well-known family of scientists. Her father Heinrich Rudolf Hertz is famous for proving the existence of electromagnetic radio waves. Her cousin, Gustav Ludwig Hertz, studied under Max Planck among others and was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in the field of nuclear physics in 1925.The Nobel Prize in Physics 1925: James Franck, Gustav Hertz Gustav Ludwig Hertz‚Äôs son Carl Hellmuth Hertz, in turn, developed medical ultrasonography at the University of Lund in Sweden.

It is located behind Marbella and to the east of the road to Ronda from the Costa del Sol. It is a candidate to become a Spanish national park. Description The park centres on La Torrecilla (), the highest point of the range, and covers an area of 300 km¬≤. This mountainous area has a rich variety of flora and fauna. Historically there has been little human influence or agricultural activity in the mountains, which can be snow-covered in the winter, hence their name in Spanish. The Sierra de las Nieves area was studied in the 19th century by Swiss botanist Pierre Edmond Boissier and in 1933 by Luis Ceballos. In 1970, a delimited area of the Sierra de las Nieves Range was declared a National Hunting Reserve. On 28 July 1989, it was declared a Natural Park, covering an area of . On 15 June 1995, it was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, and the park area was expanded to , including 11 municipalities. Caves There are a considerable number of large caves in the park, several taking the traditional form of horizontal caverns. Three are of particular interest, namely: * Hoyos del Pilar * Hoyos de Lifa * Cuevas del Moro The area is known for its shafts. One of these, GESM, is one of the deepest in Europe and was named after the Grupo de Exploraciones Subterr√°neas de M√°laga (GESM) that explored it in September 1978. The entrance to this shaft is located at 1670 m and it descends 1098 m with a few large drops. The Gran Pozo drops 115 m and the Pozo Paco de la Torre has a vertical fall of 194 m. At a depth of 900 m there are some interesting rock formations in the Sala de Maravillas, and Lake Ere is located almost at the bottom. It has still not been fully explored. Sima de la Tinaja is located in the area of the Tajo de la Caina at an altitude of 760 m. It is 54 m deep. It can be reached from Tolox. Many prehistoric artefacts have been recovered from this cave and many are to be found in the M√°laga Museum. Some of the other shafts are mentioned here. The list is by no means exclusive and many are surely yet to be discovered. * Sima Honda is located at an altitude of 1640 m and drops to a depth of 133 m and is formed from two vertical wells of 52 m and 80 m. * Sima de Horcajuelos is located at an altitude of 1600 m, dropping only 22 m. * Sima Bambi is near GESM and drops 7 m. * Sima de las Grajas is located 500 m from the Quejigales recreation area and is 10 m deep. * Sima de la Espalda is located near Hoyos de Pilar at 1750 m altitude and drops 38 m. * Sima Erotica, located near Hoyo de las Pilones, is 103 m deep with various drops, one of which is 53 m. * Complejo Raya Heleda located near Hoyos de Pilar is 57 m deep. * Sima de las Palomas located near Hoyos de Pilar is 56 m deep.

They were not however thrown to wild beasts but decapitated along with two other men who were already in prison.  Background  There are two extant versions of Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine but in only the shorter recension is the story of Timolaus and his companions recounted; in the longer recension Timolaus is not mentioned. Eusebius was present in Caesarea during the persecutions, part of the empire-wide campaign to suppress Christianity.  Persecution of Christians in Caesarea  The Emperor Diocletian had ordered that all in the Empire should perform worship and sacrifices to the Roman gods. Those who refused to do so in Caesarea, according to Eusebius, were interrogated and tortured if necessary to try to force them to apostasize, and if nothing would convince them to perform the sacrifices, they were executed.  Timolaus  The governor of Caesarea, Urban, had already had two Christians thrown to wild beasts in the public arena for refusing to perform the sacrifices to the Roman gods. As part of an upcoming festival, among the spectacles planned were more executions of this kind. Hearing of this, a young man, Timolaus from Pontus (on the Black Sea, in modern-day Turkey), along with five others, \\"went in haste\\" to the governor, having tied their own hands behind their backs, declared themselves Christians, and demanded also to be thrown to the beasts. The \\"astonished\\" governor, however, had them imprisoned for two days and then decapitated along with two others.  Companions  According to Eusebius, Timolaus' companions in seeking martyrdom in this way were \\"Dionysius from Tripolis in Phoenicia, Romulus, a sub-deacon of the parish of Diospolis, Paesis and Alexander, both Egyptians, and another Alexander from Gaza.\\" They were joined by another man who was already in prison, having previously been tortured, Agapius, and another Dionysius, who had supplied him with food while he was in prison. All eight were beheaded on the same day.  Voluntary martyrdom  It was the teaching of the church that martyrs would go immediately to heaven, be rewarded with a martyr's crown, and sit by the throne of God, unlike others who would have to wait for the Day of Judgement.

Jack Murray (May 31, 1900 ‚Äì February 7, 1961) was an American film editor with about 55 feature film credits between 1929 and 1961. Fifteen of these films were with the director John Ford. Their collaboration commenced with The Prisoner of Shark Island (1936), which was produced when both men were working at the 20th Century Fox studio. It encompassed such well-known films as The Quiet Man (1952) and The Searchers (1956), and ended only with Murray's death in 1961. Biography Born to John Wyncoup Murray Sr. and Lois Grier, Murray was raised in Georgia. His parents divorced when he was young, and he and his brother Clark eventually followed his mother out to Los Angeles, where she was working as a screenwriter with her second husband, Arthur Zellner (future publicity chief at MGM). Clark would eventually become an assistant director. From 1929 to 1939, Murray had more than 30 feature film credits for the 20th Century Fox studio and its predecessors.See Murray's filmography at the Internet Movie Database. With one exception, the films crediting Murray from 1929‚Äì1939 are from the Fox Film Corporation, the 20th Century Film Corporation, and 20th Century Fox. The exception is Back Door to Heaven (1939), which was the sole film produced by Vernon Steele Productions; see . Among his credits are Will Rogers' final film, In Old Kentucky (1935), and two films starring Shirley Temple (Curly Top (1935) and Poor Little Rich Girl (1936)). In addition to the film with Ford, in this period Murray edited films directed by Irving Cummings, H. Bruce Humberstone, and George Marshall, among others. After 1939, there are no further feature films crediting Murray until 1947, when he edited a second film with Ford, The Fugitive (1947). This was also the first film produced following the reorganization of Ford's independent production company, Argosy Pictures, which Ford and his partners created to gain more independence of the major studios that controlled most film production in that era. Tag Gallagher notes that, while the film was a disastrous start for Argosy, \\"in terms of composition, lighting and editing, The Fugitive may be among the most enjoyable pictures.\\" Murray's collaboration with Ford continued through seven more films from Argosy Pictures, which folded after producing The Sun Shines Bright (1953).Murray was the editor for all of Ford's Argosy Pictures productions after The Fugitive; for a listing of the Argosy films see After The Sun Shines Bright, Murray edited six additional films with Ford. For his studio films after 1947, Ford worked with other editors as well as with Murray. Thus What Price Glory? (1952) was produced at 20th Century Fox and was edited by Dorothy Spencer, who had previously edited Ford's Stagecoach (1939) and My Darling Clementine (1946). Murray edited Mister Roberts (1955), which was produced by Warner Bros.. Murray also occasionally edited with other directors in this period (cf. Tarzan's Peril (1951), The Steel Claw (1961)).Tarzan's Peril was directed by Byron Haskin, and The Steel Claw was directed by George Montgomery. See Murray's last film with Ford was Two Rode Together (1961); Murray died in 1961. Among the most celebrated of the films edited by Murray were The Quiet Man (1952) and The Searchers (1956), both directed by Ford and produced independently of the major studios. The Quiet Man received multiple Academy Award nominations, although not for editing. The Searchers was in the first group of 25 films selected in 1989 for the US National Film Registry. It was ranked as the seventh greatest film ever made on the 2012 decennial international survey of film critics by the British Film Institute. The period of Murray's collaboration with Ford after 1947 has been summarized by Tag Gallagher as one \\"distinguished by the vitality of its invention, at every level of cinema, but with particular intensity in montage, motion, and music.\\" The term \\"montage\\" refers to the editing of these films. While the individual contributions of Ford and of Murray to the editing of the theatrical release versions of these films aren't well known, Murray was responsible for the first, editor's cuts. Ford rarely set foot in the cutting room. Michael A. Hoey worked as Murray's assistant on Sergeant Rutledge (1960). His memoir suggests that Ford did largely entrust the editing of his films to Murray; Hoey writes of the screening of Murray's cut for Ford that it \\"... went well with surprisingly few notes, but after all Jack Murray had been editing John Ford's films since 1936's The Prisoner of Shark Island and knew the Old Man's taste better than he did himself.\\" Murray was elected to membership in the American Cinema Editors shortly after its formation in 1950.

As blockade magnitude is proportional to particle size, accurate particle sizing can be achieved after calibration with a known standard. Nanopore-based detection allows particle-by-particle assessment of complex mixtures.

Packer on October 2, 1976, at the priesthood session of the 146th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church). The sermon is addressed to young men of the Aaronic priesthood (ages 12 to 18) and discusses issues of human sexuality, puberty, and morality. From 1980 to 2016, the sermon was published as a pamphlet by the LDS Church. It has been criticized in several publications that it encourages violence against homosexuals. In 2016, the church discontinued the pamphlet.Peggy Fletcher Stack, \\"LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, November 14, 2016. Content Packer described his remarks as matters that \\"fathers should discuss with their sons.\\" Packer stated that \\"because some young men do not have fathers and because some fathers (and some bishops) do not know how to proceed\\", he would be addressing sensitive subjects. The sermon compares the male reproductive system to a \\"little factory\\" and teaches that masturbation, use of pornography, and homosexual activities are immoral and forbidden by God. It encourages young male Latter-day Saints to \\"vigorously resist\\" homosexual advances, even with violence, if necessary. Packer teaches that nocturnal emission is natural and designed by God and that young men \\"should not feel guilty\\" when it happens. The sermon also offers suggestions on how to control one's thoughts and resist temptation. Publication Unlike most general conference sermons, \\"Message to Young Men\\" was not published in the church's official magazine, The Ensign.. Note that the table of contents for this issue lacks any reference to this address. Instead, the sermon was published in 1980 as a 14-page pamphlet, entitled \\"To Young Men Only\\", that was available for church leaders to distribute to members. In 2016, the pamphlet was discontinued and it was removed from the LDS Church's website. The video of the sermon is no longer available on the LDS Church's website as of August 2019. Criticism Packer's conference address published here has been criticized for condoning anti-gay violence.Hilary Groutage Smith, \\"Mormon Pamphlets on Gays Criticized\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, 2000-08-06, p. B2David E. Hardy, \\"BYU's Dismissal of Gay Students Continues Confusion for Gays, Parents\\" [opinion], The Salt Lake Tribune, p. AA3. One controversial part of the sermon states that some men entice others to join them in sexual behaviors and gives an example of a missionary who punched (\\"floored\\") his gay companion, to which Packer responded, \\"Somebody had to do it\\". Packer then continued ‚ÄúI am not recommending that course to you, but I am not omitting it. You must protect yourself.‚Äù The audience is heard laughing after the statement ‚Äòsomebody had to do it‚Äô in the original broadcast. In 2001, gay Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn described the sermon as \\"[t]he low point in the Mormon hierarchy's homophobia since the 1950s\\";D. Michael Quinn, Same-sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-century Americans: A Mormon Example (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001) p. 382. Quinn argued that Packer's words constituted an endorsement of gay bashing and that the church itself endorsed such behavior by continuing to publish Packer's speech.D. Michael Quinn, \\"Prelude to the National 'Defense of Marriage' Campaign: Civil Discrimination Against Feared or Despised Minorities\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought vol. 33 no. 3 (Fall 2000) pp. 1‚Äì52. In 2000 and 2001, David E. Hardy, a Salt Lake City lawyer who is the father of a gay son, criticized the sermon for \\"demoniz[ing]\\" gays and implying that \\"homosexuality is a matter of choice\\".Hilary Groutage Smith, \\"Mormon Pamphlets on Gays Criticized\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, 2000-08-06, p. B2David E. Hardy, \\"BYU's Dismissal of Gay Students Continues Confusion for Gays, Parents\\" [opinion], The Salt Lake Tribune, p. AA3. In 2014, Samantha Allen, a columnist for The Daily Beast, wrote that the sermon \\"typifies organized religion‚Äôs approach to curtailing male masturbation\\", calling it \\"deeply paternalistic\\" and criticizing it for employing \\"a noxious mixture of condescension and euphemism\\".Samantha Allen, \\"Tim Ferriss Is Bro Culture's Anti-Masturbation Crusader\\", The Daily Beast, August 1, 2014.

It describes the author's observations during 13 months of travel through the 48 U.S. states beginning in November 1944. Development of the book Inside U.S.A. was the fourth in a series of highly successful \\"Inside\\" books written by Gunther. The series began in 1936 with Inside Europe, based on Gunther's experience as a journalist in Europe and described as \\"a cross between reportage and armchair travel literature.\\" The book sold over 500,000 copies. It was followed by Inside Asia in 1939 and Inside Latin America in 1941. Gunther started to plan Inside U.S.A. as early as 1936, when his idea was to create a two-part book, with the first part focused on the power structure of Washington, DC, and the second part a \\"snapshot\\" of the entirety of the United States. He did not begin serious work on the project until 1944, by which time his plan was to write about America from the perspective of an outsider. After living outside the country for more than a decade, he considered himself to have become an outsider. He joked that he was \\"writing for the man from Mars\\" and that he also was from Mars. In November 1944, after studying U.S. statistics, signing a book contract with a publisher and a second contract under which Reader's Digest would publish excerpts while he was still writing, and sending a list of questions and interview requests to the governor of every state, he set out to tour the country and interview its prominent citizens, including business leaders, politicians, writers, and academics. Gunther's journey took him to more than 300 communities in all 48 states, including 38 of the 43 U.S. cities that had populations greater than 200,000. By the time of the trip, Gunther was very well known as a journalist and author. His celebrity status not only gave him unusual access to many prominent people, but it also caused his travels to receive a great deal of public attention. Local newspapers often covered his visits in front-page news stories. Some civic leaders and politicians who had not been asked to give interviews sought him out in hopes that their perspectives would not be omitted from his book. Gunther became so engrossed in the project that in April 1945 he declined an opportunity to go to Europe just before V-E Day, even though he had spent a significant part of his journalism career as a foreign correspondent in Europe, covering the situations and events that led up to World War II. An external event that did slow the process of writing the book was the fatal illness of Gunther's teenage son Johnny. In April 1946, Johnny was found to have a malignant brain tumor. Gunther managed to continue writing through his son's illness, which he was later to chronicle in the book Death Be Not Proud. Inside U.S.A. grew much longer than originally planned, which presented a problem because paper was in short supply in the postwar period. When published in May 1946, it totaled 979 pages. The first U.S. printing run was more than 500,000 copies, including 35,000 copies for the book's British publishing house, Hamish Hamilton, which was unable to obtain enough paper to print the book in England. Content The book is divided into 52 chapters, organized by geography. Its geographical structure begins in California, continues through other western states to the Great Plains and Midwest, then east to the Northeast and Southeast, then west to Texas and Oklahoma, and finally to the \\"new states\\" of New Mexico and Arizona. Factual information about topics like geography, population, and history is commingled with highly opinionated statements (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. called some of these opinions \\"flip judgments\\") about America's places and people. According to Gunther, Southern California was \\"the California of petroleum, crazy religious cults, the citrus industry, ... the weirdest architecture in the United States, ... and devotees of funny money\\", and a place where \\"climate is worshipped as a god\\". Gunther described Phoenix, Arizona as the \\"cleanest city\\" he saw and Indianapolis as \\"the dirtiest.\\" He called Knoxville, Tennessee, \\"an extremely puritanical town\\" and the \\"ugliest city\\" he saw. (The remarks about Indianapolis' dirtiness and Knoxville's ugliness spurred both of these cities to start beautification efforts and led Knoxville to establish the annual Dogwood Arts Festival.) He said that the \\"best beef\\" he ate was in Montana, the \\"best single meal\\" in Milwaukee, and the \\"best ice cream\\" in Richmond, Virginia. Regarding government and politics, Gunther described New York as the \\"best-governed\\" state and Wisconsin and Vermont as the two states with the \\"cleanest politics\\", while he said Pennsylvania had the \\"dirtiest politics\\" and any of the southern states \\"below Mason's and Dixon's line\\" could qualify as \\"worst-governed\\". In a three-page profile of California governor Earl Warren, he described him as \\"honest, likable and clean\\" and someone \\"with the limitations of all Americans of his type with little intellectual background ... or coherent political philosophy\\" who would \\"never set the world on fire\\". (Gunther was later to call his characterization of Warren, who was to become the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, \\"the most serious misjudgment of a personality I have ever made.\\") Reception Inside U.S.A. was the Book-of-the-Month Club main selection for June 1947 and ranked third among the best-selling nonfiction books in the U.S. for the full year. Follow-on works The book inspired and gave its name to a 1948 Broadway musical revue, Inside U.S.A., that was very loosely based on the book. Gunther intended to write a companion book, to be titled Inside Washington, focused on the nation-scale problems, personalities, and institutions of the U.S. He never completed the second book, because of the amount that would be required and because he could not decide how best to coordinate the publication timing with the quadrennial cycle of presidential elections. A revised edition of Inside U.S.A. was released in 1951. He later continued his \\"Inside\\" series with three more books: Inside Africa in 1955, Inside Russia Today in 1958, and Inside Europe Today in 1961. A 50th anniversary edition of Inside U.S.A. was published in 1997 (). In the 1960s, writer Neal R. Peirce decided to undertake a project similar to Gunther's, with the aim of updating the account of America that Gunther had provided in Inside U.S.A. After consulting with Gunther, who agreed on the need for an updated book, in 1969 Peirce began a series of trips to each of the 50 states, interviewing state and local leaders as well as \\"plain people\\". The single book that Peirce originally planned grew to become a series of nine \\"States of America\\" books published between 1971 and 1980.

At the time of discovery it was the second-smallest exoplanet discovered and confirmed by the Kepler spacecraft, after Kepler-37b. It was found using the transit method, in which the dimming that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Its stellar flux is 25 ¬± 3 times Earth's. It is similar to Mercury. Characteristics Mass, radius and temperature Kepler-62c is a sub- Earth, an exoplanet with a radius and mass smaller than Earth. It has an equilibrium temperature of . It has a radius of 0.54 . This is about the size of Mars, making it the second-smallest exoplanet discovered, with Kepler-37b being the size of the Moon. However, the mass is currently not known, estimates place an upper limit of <4 , the real mass is expected to be significantly lower than this, say around 0.1 , comparable to the size of Kepler-37b. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) star named Kepler-62, orbited by a total of five planets. The star has a mass of 0.69 and a radius of 0.64 . It has a temperature of 4925 K and is 7 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is somewhat metal-poor, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of ‚àí0.37, or 42% of the solar amount. Its luminosity () is 21% that of the Sun. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13.65. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Orbit Kepler-62c orbits its host star with an orbital period of 12 days at a distance of about 0.092 AU (compared to the distance of Mercury from the Sun, which is about 0.38 AU). It receives about 25 times more sunlight than Earth does from the Sun. Discovery In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-62; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-62c occurred roughly every 12 days (its orbital period), it was eventually concluded that a planetary body was responsible for the periodic 12-day transits. The discovery, along with the planetary system of the star Kepler-69 were announced on April 18, 2013.

They are generally considered the first Polish and Slovak Americans. History The first glass house at the Jamestown Colony was built and operated exclusively by Polish immigrants, circa. 1608 The first Polish immigrants came to the Jamestown colony in 1608, twelve years before the Pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts.Richmond, From Da to Yes, p. 72 These early settlers were brought as skilled artisans by the English soldier‚Äìadventurer Captain John Smith, and included a glass blower, a pitch and tar maker, a soap maker and a timberman. English writer Richard Hakluyt wrote in 1586 that colonization would require \\"men skillful in burning of Sope ashes, and in making of Pitch and Tarre, and Rosen, to be fetched out of Prussia and Poland, which are thence to be had for small wages, being there in manner of slaves.\\" John Smith traveled from England to Poland in 1603 to find artisans for his voyage to America. There were six Polish men that traveled with him in 1603; their names were never known definitely until 1943, when historian Karol Wachtl searched through historical Polish pamphlets in war-torn France dating to the mid-19th century. Although it is not known what documents he used in his findings, his publication, \\"Polonia w Ameryce\\" was accurate in naming the settlers. In 1947, a purported historical memoir, \\"Pamiƒôtnik handlowca\\" (\\"A Merchantilist's memoir\\") was rumored to have surfaced in the United States and to have confirmed the names of the settlers.Searching for Polish Jamestown Sources Arthur L. Waldo Polish American Studies Vol. 17, No. 3/4 (Jul. ‚Äì Dec., 1960), pp. 105‚Äì114 The memoir was to have been written by Zbigniew Stefanski, a Pole who lived in the Jamestown colony with John Smith and later to have written his memoir in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1625. The memoir was to have revealed much about the Jamestown colony, and to have detailed stories about how Polish settlers taught the pioneers how to dig wells for drinking water, fought a strike for their right to vote, and introduced the settlers to baseball. No copy of the original text is known to exist. Nonetheless, famed settlers known today include Micha≈Ç ≈Åowicki, Zbigniew Stefa≈Ñski, Jan Mata, and Stanis≈Çaw Sadowski.Praca zbiorowa, \\"Polska informator\\", Interpress, Warszawa 1977 Stefanski's purported memoir changed the perception of Jamestown history; it is known from primary English sources that the Poles were hired as skilled artisans, but in Stefanski's memoir, the 6 men were to have been merchants (or at least trading officials) in Poland.Waldo. True Heroes of Jamestown. p. 210. No mention of the religious background of the Polish settlers was made, and historian James Pula suggests that the Poles were likely Protestant because contemporary English sources such as Richard Hakluyt's in 1584 explicitly said no Catholic artisans should be used because of \\"the special inclination they have of favor to the King of Spain\\"Waldo. The True Heroes of Jamestown. p. 135. Captain John Smith noted that two craftsmen helped save his life during an Indian attack that occurred near the glasshouse. (also noted in \\"Smith's own journals\\"). An excavation done in 1948‚Äì1949 found four Hessian crucibles and large quantities of \\"common green glass\\". The glass remains of window panes, bottles, and drinking jugs were found. The Glass House and the glass manufacturing industry was started and operated exclusively by the Polish workers. Strike Polish settlers launched a labor strike in 1619 against the Virginia Company, and were successful in reaching an agreement. The skills of these Polish colonists were vital to the new settlement, as the House of Burgesses ultimately recognized when it met in 1619. During its deliberations, the House excluded the Polish community from voting rights. In reaction, the Poles launched the first recorded strike in the New World. :\\"For pitch and tar, we advise and require that the Polackers be returned in part to these their works, with such other assistance as shall be necessary. The like we shall desire for pot-ashes and soap-ashes, when there shall be fit store of hand to assist them: Requiring in the mean time, the care be generally taken, that Servants and Apprentices be so trained up in these works, as that the skill do not perish together with the Masters.\\" (from Records of the Virginia Company, May 17, 1620.) Impact and historical significance In need of their industries, the House of Burgesses extended the \\"rights of Englishmen\\" to the Poles (which included some East Prussians.) Historians have identified this struggle a historical first in many respects: as an American labor strike, fight for civil rights and voting representation, and the origin of the first-ever trade apprenticeship in the American colonies. Subsequently, the Poles established the first bilingual schools in the New World, teaching both Polish and English and later extending the curriculum to include Latin and German. The political and economic power of the Polish community declined, however, with the increased colonial warfare with Native Americans. Depictions Poles in Jamestown by Arthur Szyk, 1939. Depiction of the Jamestown Polish craftsmen. Arguably the best-known rendition of the Jamestown Polish craftsmen is the painting of Poles in Jamestown by Arthur Szyk. The painting was part of a collection in the Polish Pavilion of the New York World Exposition in 1939. It displays 11 Poles, when historical documents state there were \\"eight Dutchmen and Poles\\". Historian Arthur Waldo recalled expecting to see only five Poles in the painting, and asked Szyk in-person why he chose to portray 11. Szyk explained that he was inspired to make the painting by a group of historians from the Polish Foreign Office who wanted the painting to be against a summer backdrop. Staying true to history, Szyk chose to paint the second arrival of Jamestown Polish craftsmen, who arrived in 1609, rather than the first group of Poles, who were believed to number five. The painting also shows Poles in tight-fitting trousers and bright decorations characteristic of the mountaineer region, but the black summer cap tops were clearly Krakovian. Szyk explained to Waldo that they were shown as peasants rather than artisans because doing so allowed more creative license in making folk costumes and creating a distinctly Polish look. Szyk, reflecting on his work, took satisfaction in expressing Polish identity and pride through the painting.Searching for Polish Jamestown Sources. Arthur L. Waldo. Polish American Studies.

The work survives in two forms, a shorter recension which formed part of his Ecclesiastical History, and a longer version, discovered only in 1866. Eusebius was present in Caesarea at the time of the persecutions he recounts. Background The shorter version of Martyrs of Palestine was probably a revision of the longer recension. It is possible that both extant versions are only fragments of a now lost longer work. The long recension was composed sometime after 311, when the persecutions in Caesarea had ceased, and published in 315-316. Short recension Although shorter than the other version, there are accounts of martyrdoms in Caesarea that are not contained in the long recension, such as the voluntary martyrdoms of Timolaus and Companions. Long recension The cruelty of the persecutors, the endurance and suffering of the martyrs, are entered into in greater detail in the longer version. Reliability Eusebius openly states that he is not going to discuss anything that does not \\"vindicate the divine judgement\\" and will relate only those things \\"which may be useful first to ourselves and afterwards to posterity\\", which caused 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon to distrust the work altogether.Edward Gibbon, Decline and Fall, vol. 1, chapter 16 However in the 19th century, historian Joseph Barber Lightfoot commended Eusebius in such passages for his honesty.

It was destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire of 1906. It was one of the many hotels named Occidental in the United States, and it was among the few luxury hotels in San Francisco that catered to wealthy travelers. Operating in the years that roughly coincided with the end of the California Gold Rush and the beginning of silver mining in Nevada, the Occidental Hotel was among the new, grand hotels in San Francisco. In the exclusive hotel market, along with the Occidental were the Lick House, the Russ House, the Cosmopolitan, the Grand, the Palace, and the Baldwin. Construction Construction of the hotel occurred in three stages between 1861 and 1869, and it opened upon completion of the first section on the southeast corner of Montgomery and Bush Streets, under the direction of architect Caleb Hyatt. Hyatt designed an Italianate, four-story building, and the style was preserved by subsequent architects. Along with the nearby Masonic Hall, the Occidental towered above all other buildings in its vicinity and was visible from outside the city. Its accommodations were elegant and spacious. The second phase of construction was directed by architect Thomas Johnston, and the third phase by architect William Mooser. During an investigation into the construction of the former San Francisco City Hall in the early 1870s, Johnston testified that the Occidental was constructed with foundation rocks quarried from Angel Island, built with wood floors and joists, and reinforced with iron bands used for structural stabilization. Another architect, Stephen H. Williams, estimated the construction costs of the hotel to be between sixteen and eighteen cents per square foot. Hotel Description Theatrical agent and author Edward Peron Hingston described the hotel in 1863, :An air of sumptuous splendor and easeful comfort strikes us immediately as we enter the doors, as being characteristics of the house. Newly built, only a portion of the intended edifice completed, and the grand staircase not yet opened, the Occidental is but an incomplete sample of that which it is intended to be. The interior fittings are those of a first-class hotel; the bedrooms are airy, the beds soft and large; the salle-a-manger is a spacious hall, with elaborate embellishments and columns of noble proportions. There are breakfast rooms and supper rooms, hot and cold baths for everybody, well-carpeted stairs, elegant drawing rooms for the use of the ladies, pianos of the best manufacture, and lounges and rocking chairs of the most luxurious construction. The attendance is far better than in most English hotels, with none of that bowing and scraping servility among the waiters which constitutes the most offensive form of attention. Our two dollars and a half per day includes attendance. Hotel service included vases of flowers and platters of fruit delivered to guestrooms when a new guest arrived. Guests Some of the guests who stayed at the hotel included Robert Louis Stevenson, Lillie Hitchcock Coit, and Mark Twain. In his notebook from February, 1865, Twain wrote, \\"26thHome againhome again at the Occidental Hotel.\\" Ralph Waldo Emerson stayed at the hotel while on the lecture circuit. The hotel attracted authors and intellectuals at least partly because The Golden Era, a weekly literary magazine, was headquartered there. Joaquin Miller described the magazine's offices as gaudily carpeted and gorgeously furnished. The British-born American missionary, Harriet G. Brittan, died at the hotel in 1897. Restaurant and bar The restaurant and bar at the hotel were among San Francisco's informal meeting venues for political and business discussions. Bartender Jerry Thomas claimed to have invented the Martini at the Occidental, although other origins have been suggested. Developing drinks there, in other major cities, and in four saloons he operated in New York City in the late 19th century, Thomas is considered the \\"father of American mixology.\\"Pete Wells, Frost on the Sun: Summertime Cocktails, New York Times, June 21, 2006. In 1863 he was earning $100 per week at the Occidental, higher pay than the vice-president of the United States.William Grimes, The Bartender Who Started It All, New York Times, October 31, 2007. Earthquake and fire The day of the San Francisco earthquake, Henry Pittock, publisher of The Oregonian, was a guest in the hotel. Although not injured by falling debris, Pittock said that his suitcase was \\"flattened like a pancake.\\" Journalist Ashton Stevens was also a guest, and he wrote, \\"When the ceiling came down on the top floor of the Occidental Hotel we fled with barely enough clothes for panic modesty.\\" Author Gertrude Atherton had stored some of her belongings at the hotel, and when she arrived to claim them after the earthquake, all she could find were 40,000 words of the yet unpublished manuscript, Ancestors. The hotel was damaged in the earthquake, and it was immediately evacuated. The ensuing fire that destroyed much of San Francisco also claimed the Occidental, and the remaining structure soon was demolished. Salvage estimators valued the earthquake-damaged hotel before the fire at $285,000 and after the fire at $15,000, a loss of $270,000. By comparison, the property had been appraised eleven years earlier upon the death of owner Joseph Donohoe whose half interest in the hotel amounted to $481,250, making the total value of the hotel in 1895 worth almost a million dollars. Using the pre-earthquake figure, the loss was about $950,000. Additional notoriety In 1870, Laura Fair stayed at the Occidental Hotel with the Crittenden family prior to murdering Alexander Crittenden. The Occidental Cigar Club in San Francisco's Financial District takes its name from the Occidental Hotel. See also * History of San Francisco * Hotel Occidental House, from the Robert N.

It primarily relates to virilization of the female genitalia in cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and identifies five distinct stages, but in recent times has been used to describe the range of differentiation of genitalia, with normal infant presentation being shown on either end of the scale, female on the left (0) and male on the right (6).  Staging  * An infant at Stage 0 would be considered as having normal female external genitalia. * Stage 1 has a mildly large clitoris and slightly reduced vaginal opening size. This degree may go unnoticed or may be simply assumed to be within normal variation. * For Stage 2, genitalia are obviously abnormal to the eye, with a phallus intermediate in size and a small vaginal opening with separate urethral opening. Posterior labial fusion will be present. * Stage 3 shows a further enlarged phallus, with a single urogenital sinus and almost complete fusion of the labia. * Stage 4 looks more male than female, with an empty scrotum and a phallus the size of a normal penis, but not quite free enough of the perineum to be pulled onto the abdomen toward the umbilicus (i.e., what is termed a chordee in a male). The single small urethral/vaginal opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus would be considered a hypospadias in a male. X-rays taken after dye injection into this opening reveal the internal connection with the upper vagina and uterus. This common opening can predispose to urinary obstruction and infection. * Stage 5 denotes complete male virilization, with a normally formed penis with the urethral opening at or near the tip. The scrotum is normally formed but empty. The internal pelvic organs include normal ovaries and uterus, and the vagina connects internally with the urethra as in Stage 4. These infants are not visibly ambiguous are usually assumed to be ordinary boys with undescended testes. In most cases, the diagnosis of CAH is not suspected until signs of salt-wasting develop a week later. * Stage 6 indicates normal male presentation, with no hypospadias present and normal testes. Controversy While the scale has been defined as a grading system for \\"abnormal\\" genitalia, the concept that atypical genitals are necessarily abnormal is contested. An opinion paper by the Swiss National Advisory Centre for Biomedical Ethics advises that \\"not infrequently\\" variations from sex norms may not be pathological or require medical treatment. Similarly, an Australian Senate Committee report on involuntary sterilization determined that research \\"regarding 'adequate' or 'normal' genitals, particularly for women, raises some disturbing questions\\", including preferences influenced by doctors' specialism and gender. Related concepts Numerous clinical scales and measurement systems exist to define genitals as normal male or female, or \\"abnormal\\", including the orchidometer, Quigley scale and the satirical Phall- O-Meter.

Arum palaestinum is perhaps best known for it long history in the Middle East as food and for it use in traditional Middle Eastern medicine. Arum berries Description It grows high. It blooms in the spring, between the months of March and April, by which time the plant is easily recognized by its dark purplish-black spadix enclosed by a reddish-brown spathe.Avi Shmida, MAPA's Dictionary of Plants and Flowers in Israel, Tel-Aviv 2005, p. 235 (s.v. Arum palaestinum) (Hebrew) It is perennial plant. The leaves of A. palaestinum are light green, narrow, and upright with a purplish-black color. The root is tuberous. Like other members of the genus Arum, this plant gives off a scent that attracts flies, which distribute the pollen; while most other family members smell like dung and carrion, this plant can smell like rotting fruit as well. It is native to the Levant and other parts of the Mediterranean Basin, and has been naturalized in North America, North Africa, Europe, Western Asia, and Australia Toxicity Arum palaestinum is toxic at low doses, and this has traditionally been considered to be due to oxalate salts, but this is not certain. The symptoms caused by exposure to the raw plant include mucous membrane irritation, and burning, and consuming larger doses causes nausea, diarrhea, and cramping. Because exposure to skin can cause irritation it is often handled lightly, or with gloves. History Engraved drawings of various species of Arum are seen in the Temple of Thutmose III in Karnak (Egypt), depicting the plants when they were brought from Canaan in the year 1447 BCE. The plant is mentioned in the Mishnah, where its cultivation and use as food was described. Theophrastus' Enquiry into Plants, described the necessity of leaching the roots and leaves before they can be eaten.Theophrastus, Enquiry into Plants (vol. 2), [Book VII, Chapter XII, Paragraph 2], p. 125 in the Loeb Classical Library series: \\"The root of cuckoo-pint (Arum) is also edible, and so are the leaves, if they are first boiled down in vinegar.\\" See: Uses Food In Middle Eastern cooking, the leaves are cut up and thoroughly cooked with lemon or sorrel. It is also used in soups. It is commonly consumed with flat bread or bulgar, and is reported to have a taste similar to Swiss chard. Traditional medicine In traditional medicine among Arabs in Palestine, Arum palaestinum extracts have been used for cancer, intestinal worms, infections in open wounds, urinary tract obstructions, and kidney stones, and are thought to strengthen bones. Jews in Iraq have used it traditionally for worms, skin sores, syphilis, rheumatism, tuberculosis, and diarrhea. It has also been used for cough and constipation. Ethnobotanical data have shown that A. palaestinum was reported as one of the most commonly used plants in the West Bank, used by over half of all respondents. Recent Developments In a recent revision of his book, Killing Cancer ‚Äì Not People, author Robert G. Wright discusses one dietary supplement company‚Äôs use of Arum palaestinum in one of its products.Wright, Robert G., Killing Cancer ‚Äì Not People, 4th ed., American Anti-Cancer Institute, (2019), pp. 149-151.

This design was a refurbished Mauser Kar98k rifle that had been left-over by Germans or captured by partisans during World War II. History The picture shows the Mauser K98k action on the M98/48The picture shows the front sight ring, a feature that was mainly absent on the original Mauser K98k rifles. Soon after World War II, the new formed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was trying to re-arm its military forces. The main problem that the Yugoslav government had to face was the lack of funds and the fear of an imminent conflict. A temporary solution was found in refurbishing the rifles that were captured or left over by the Germans. They were noted for their reliability, great accuracy, effective range and would not require a new mass production plant - thanks to the fact that all the components of the rifles were already available. These rifles were never used extensively until they were replaced, in 1948, by the Yugoslav-made Zastava M48. Some of these rifles were used in a sniper rifle role during the Yugoslav Wars of 1990s. The rifles have been adapted, through machining, to accept new locally-made telescopic sights-the ZRAK series. Design details The picture shows Yugo markings on a refurbished k98k rifle. These rifles are actually Karabiner 98k rifles that were left over by Germany or captured by Marshal Tito's partisan army, or Liberation Army. Despite the name of the rifles (which may lead to misunderstandings), the only difference between a Nazi German K98k and a Zastava M98/48 consists of the markings and the front barrel band. They are virtually identical to each other, since they are still the same rifles at their core. Markings The original German markings were scrubbed and replaced by the Yugoslav ones. The most noticeable markings are the Yugoslav Crest and the \\"Preduzece 44\\"(It refers to the site where it was refurbished; for example \\"Preduzece 44\\" stands for \\"Institute 44\\"-Kragujevac, Serbia-the current location of Zastava Arms) present on the receiver's ring. Another noticeable marking is the one present on the left side of the receiver, the \\"Mod. 98/48\\". The \\"/48\\" is absent on all the rifles that have been refurbished before 1950.

He is known as President of the American Institute of Mining Engineers in 1883 and 1906; President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in the year 1891‚Äì92; and President of the Western Society of Engineers in 1893.  Biography  Early career Born in Fallsington, Pennsylvania, he was the only son of Dr. Robert A. Hunt and Martha Lancaster Woolston. His father, a graduate of Princeton College and University of Pennsylvania, was a practicing physician. However, health issues led to him leaving his practice and moving with his family to Covington, Kentucky where he ran a pharmacy store. It was there that the young Hunt received his early education in the local public schools. Hunt's father died in 1855, which required his son to leave school at the age of 18 and take over his father's business. With his health failing, in 1857 Robert W. Hunt had to sell the pharmacy business and then travel to Pottsville, Pennsylvania to recuperate. He became employed at the John Burnish & Company, an iron rolling mill in Pottsville, where his cousin T. W. Yardley was a senior partner. At this mill he learned the skills of the iron working industry. In 1859 he joined Booth, Garrett & Reese, an analytical laboratory in Philadelphia, where he took a course in analytical chemistry. When his study was completed, in 1860 he joined Wood, Morrell & Co. as a chemist and established an iron and steel works laboratory in Johnstown, Pennsylvania for the Cambria Iron Company. By the spring of 1861, he was working as night foreman for the Elmira rolling mill in Elmira, New York. Once the American Civil War began in 1861, he joined the Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, where he rose in rank from Private to Captain and was placed in charge of Camp Curtin in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania during the fall of 1862. The following year he became the mustering officer for the state of Pennsylvania. In 1864 he helped recruit Captain Bruce Lambert's Independent Mounted Company, Pennsylvania volunteers. When the war ended in 1865, he was mustered out of the service with the rank of Sergeant; yielding the rank of Lieutenant to a friend. Post-war period Returning to civilian life, in July 1865 he went to work for the Cambria Co. and was named superintendent of the experimental Bessemer steel works in Wyandotte, Michigan. This was the first Bessemer steel plant to be operated in the United States. He remained in charge of the Wyandotte Bessemer Works until 1866, when he returned to Johnstown where the Cambria Co. was erecting a Bessemer plant. Since the construction of this factory was not completed until July 1871, Cambria placed Hunt in charge of the process of rolling steel ingots into rail tracks for use by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Once the Cambria Bessemer plant was put into operation, Hunt, along with John E. Fry and Alexander L. Holley introduced a new bottom casting method for which the three received a patent. Hunt remained with the Cambria Co. until September, 1873, when he became superintendent of the Bessemer works of John A. Griswald & Company in Troy, New York. He would remain with Griswald's company until 1888. In 1883 he was elected to serve a term as the president of the American Institute of Mining Engineers. Moving to Chicago in the spring of 1888, he started the business of Messrs. Robert W. Hunt & Company in April, which engaged in the business of inspection, testing, and consultation. He was elected President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in November, 1890, serving his term during 1891‚Äì92. In 1893, he was named president of the Western Society of Engineers. He was again elected president of the American Institute of Mining Engineers in 1906. He became president of the American Society for Testing and Materials in 1912 and vice-president of the International Association for Testing Materials in 1914. On December 5, 1912, he was awarded the John Fritz Medal in New York for \\"his contributions to the early development of the Bessemer process\\". Named a trustee of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1886, he was bestowed the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering by Rensselaer on June 4, 1916. In 1923 he received the Washington Award. Hunt was married to Eleanor Clark in December, 1866; the couple would have no children. His estate endowed the Hunt Professorship in Metallurgical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The Robert W. Hunt Company continues to operate to this day, becoming a subsidiary of U.S. Laboratories Inc. in 2001.

In the 2000 LegCo election, he was returned to the same seat with 464 votes, again the fifth-highest out of the ten candidates. In 2003, he was reappointed a Hong Kong deputy to the 10th National People's Congress. In July 2004, as the end of Chu's LegCo term neared and the Election Committee constituency was scheduled to be abolished, he spoke out against the slow progress towards democratisation in Hong Kong, calling Beijing's announcement that the 2007 Chief Executive election would not employ universal suffrage \\"unfortunate\\". He considered running as a candidate for the New Territories East geographical constituency in the 2004 LegCo election. However, the pro-Beijing camp pressed stronger HKPA candidates to drop out of the race so as not to split the vote and spoil DAB candidates' chances of election in the same constituencies; instead, Tso Wung-Wai ran as the HKPA candidate in Chu's place, and lost badly, ensuring the victory of DAB candidates Lau Kong-wah and Li Kwok-ying. Chu stood as a candidate to be returned to the 11th National People's Congress in January 2008, but did not gain enough support; along with Philip Wong, he was one of two former Hong Kong deputies who failed to retain their seats. Personal life In his spare time, he enjoys cave diving and paragliding. He is married to Ho Miu-hing (‰ΩïÂ¶ôÈ¶®), the daughter of Hang Seng Bank co-founder Ho Tim (‰ΩïÊ∑ª). They have two children and live in Repulse Bay. Chu renounced US citizenship in June 1994. After his renunciation, he placed his cancelled United States passport in a time capsule and held a public burial ceremony for it.

It is the feature film debut of Carmelo Bene and it is based on a stage play by the same Bene. It won the Special Jury Prize at the 1968 Venice Film Festival. The film was shown as part of a retrospective \\"Questi fantasmi: Cinema italiano ritrovato\\" at the 65th Venice International Film Festival.  Plot  A man (Carmelo Bene) cannot bear to be part of the society he lives in. He considers himself a \\"jerk\\" and so invents his own philosophy, which involves the destruction of the ways of his native land of Apulia, where all residents are devoted to the Catholic religion. However, the man cannot destroy the belief of the pilgrims of Salento, because a woman prevents him. She is an unknown \\"Santa Margherita\\", who tries to turn the man away from what she considers his weird and impossible philosophy. Successive scenes of the film show various dreamlike situations in which the two protagonists try to best each other. After a blasphemous dialogue between monks, the man includes his whole philosophy in a Moorish building. In fact, this seems to have been the scene of the massacre of the famous 800 Martyrs of Otranto, who are considered by the sceptic to be the absolute death of Christianity. The man, dressed as a medieval knight, tries to find pleasure in amorous adventures with a servant, but fails completely. In fact, it seems that a part of him is tied to something so holy that he cannot stand. The woman in the story has told him that she wants to save him from his own philosophy, but the man has always refused. Now that the man is determined to change and destroy his own philosophy, he discovers that it is too late. Santa Margherita, in the famous Moorish palace, is no longer willing to forgive and to convert the man who, struck down, dies without happiness.

Works The partnership between Edward Birchall, who had practised in Leeds since the early 1860s, and John Kelly, who had previously been in partnership with Richard Life Adams (1840‚Äì83), was established in 1886. The church of St Mary of Bethany, New Wortley, Leeds was one of Kelly & Birchall's earliest projects. Initially worked on by Adams & Kelly, Kelly & Birchall took it to completion. Built in 1885 at a cost of ¬£5,600, it featured a spire of 135 feet and a brick-lined interior. St Mary of Bethany was demolished in 1975. Two more of Kelly & Birchall's Leeds buildings have also since been demolished. The original All Hallows Church, on the corner of Hyde Park Road and Regent Terrace, Leeds, built in 1876 at an estimated cost of ¬£10,585, was destroyed by fire on 27 April 1970, though the vicarage remains. The Roman Catholic church of St Francis of Assisi, Manor Road, Holbeck, built in 1896, was closed and demolished in 1979. Kelly & Birchall designed the Grade II listed St Luke's Church on Gibbon Road in Kingston upon Thames, built between 1886 and 1887 and the Grade II* listed St Patrick's Church, Soho Square (a Roman Catholic church in central London), built between 1891 and 1893. In Leeds they also designed the Central Higher Grade School (later known as Leeds Higher Grade School) in Woodhouse Lane; this was built in 1889, with an attic added in 1890 by William Landless, who had been clerk of works at Kelly & Birchall, executing designs on their behalf. The building was converted to Council offices in 1994‚Äì95. John Kelly went on to design several notable churches, including All Saints' Church, Petersham in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames (Grade II listed, and now a private residence). Kelly's Roman Catholic churches, which also include St Agatha's Roman Catholic Church, Kingston upon Thames and Sacred Heart Church, Teddington in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, are all in a distinctive Italianate style, with Romanesque features and some with large campanile. Towards the end of his career, Kelly was short-listed for, but failed to win, the contract for the Cathedral Church of St Anne's, Leeds. Approaching retirement, Kelly established a new practice, John Kelly & Sons, in Oxford Street, London. The church of St Alban and St Stephen in St Albans dates from this time. Following John Kelly's death in 1904, his son Claude Kelly took over the practice. The design of St Peter's Church, Aldrington in Hove (Grade II listed), attributed to Claude, is believed to have also been worked on by his father. Edward Birchall's other work includes the country house Tylney Hall in Hampshire, built in 1879, which is Grade II listed and is now a hotel, and Carlton Hill Friends Meeting House (1868) which was the principal Quaker Meeting House in Leeds. Part of the building became a clothing factory in 1921, with the Quakers continuing to meet in a schoolroom at the back until 1979. The building was refurbished by Leeds Metropolitan University in 2007 and is now called Old Broadcasting House. It has a blue plaque, erected by Leeds Civic Trust, commemorating Birchall and the history of the building.

It was founded in 1962 with an aim to advance knowledge on venoms, poisons and toxins of animal, plant and microbial origin. Origin Pioneer research In 1664 an Italian polymath Francesco Redi wrote his first monumental work Osservazioni intorno alle vipere (Observations about the Viper) in which he first elucidated the scientific basis of snakebite and venom of the viper. He showed that the venom is produced from the fang, it is not poisonous when swallowed, and dangerous only when it enters the bloodstream. He even showed how to stop or slow down the venom action in the blood by tight ligature before the wound. This work is heralded as the foundation of toxinology and the beginning of experimental toxicology. Foundation In 1962 a group of scientists and clinicians who have made significant contributions to toxinology joined forces to establish a working society. The Society had its first international meeting in 1966 in Atlantic City, USA. Findlay E. Russell was the first president of the Society. Organisation and Membership The Society aims to advance knowledge on the properties of toxins and antitoxins and to bring together scholars interested in the field. Full membership is open to those who have published meritorious original investigations in toxinology, while persons who do not qualify for membership but are interested in the field of toxinology are eligible for associate membership. There is also student membership. World Congresses of the Society and Symposia of the IST-Sections (European, Pan-American, Asia- Pacific) are regularly organised to promote communication and exchange of results in toxinology research. The officers of the Society, the President and Secretary-Treasurer, are assisted by a Council and they all are elected by the members. Award IST sponsors the Redi Award to honour scientists who have contributed distinguished work in the field of toxinology. This is the most prestigious award in the world in toxinology. The award is given at each World Congress of IST (generally held every three years) since 1967. Initiative At the Asia-Pacific Section Congress in Vietnam in December 2008, a proposal by Prof David Warrell (recipient of the Redi Award 2012) that The Global Snakebite Initiative be formally endorsed as an official initiative of the IST was passed, and confirmed unanimously at the IST World Congress in Recife, Brazil, in March 2009. The Global Snakebite Initiative is the follow-up of the World Health Organization programme on snakebite as one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases. Publication Toxicon is the official journal of the Society, started in 1963, and is now published monthly by Elsevier.

Municipally it is incorporated as Dubrovskoye Urban Settlement, one of the eight urban settlements in the district. Population: History The village of Dubrovo is known since 1500. By the 19th centuries, there were two villages, Vyborgskaya Dubrovka and Moskovskaya Dubrovka. In the end of the 19th century, it was a part of Shlisselburgsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate (since 1913, Petrograd Governorate). On February 14, 1923 Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was merged into Petrogradsky Uyezd. In January 1924 the uyezd and the governorate were renamed Leningradsky. On May 26, 1927 Moskovskaya Dubrovka was granted urban-type settlement status and renamed Dubrovka. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Leninsky District, with the administrative center in the settlement of Vsevolozhskoye, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On August 19, 1930 Leninsky District was abolished and merged into newly established Leningradsky Prigorodny District with the administrative center in the city of Leningrad. On August 19, 1936 Leningradsky Prigorodny District was abolished, and the settlement was transferred into newly established Vsevolozhsky District, with the administrative center in the suburban settlement of Vsevolozhskoye. Economy Industry Dubrovka has a number of industrial enterprises, in particular, of chemical and construction industries. Transportation Nevskaya Dubrovka station Dubrovka has the terminal station (Nevskaya Dubrovka station) on the railway from Saint Petersburg via Vsevolozhsk. Another station, 37 km, is located within the limits of the settlement as well. There is suburban service to the Finland Station in Saint Petersburg. The settlement has a road access to the M18 highway which connects Saint Petersburg and Murmansk via Petrozavodsk. The Neva is navigable. Culture and recreation The district six objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. They commemorate the events of the Siege of Leningrad, when the front line was running on the Neva River, and Dubrovka was on the Soviet Army defense line. Soviet troops twice held the Nevsky Pyatachok, a tiny area on the left bank of the Neva opposite to Dubrovka, for an extended time in hope to develop a massive offensive. The museum of the Nevsky Pyatachok is located in Dubrovka.

Policies include reviewing the necessity of state government to reduce Australia's political system to two layers rather than three and reviewing certain taxes. The party was founded in March 2013 by McIntyre, whose objective was to create \\"an abundant, prosperous 21st century economy, for all Australians to fairly share in the massive wealth our large nation (Australia) can provide\\". The party was launched at Glen Innes RSL on 22 April 2013 and aimed to field candidates in most of the 150 lower house seats of the 2013 Federal election, but was unable to be registered before the deadline. The party was registered with the Australian Electoral Commission on 7 November 2013. Labelled a \\"controversial spruiker\\" by the ABC, McIntyre was investigated by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) from 2002 to 2007. ASIC agreed to discontinue the proceedings in 2007 after he repaid investors. History McIntyre founded the party in March 2013 and announced that he would challenge Tony Windsor for the New England seat. McIntyre comes from a farming family in New England, New South Wales and owns several rural holdings in the area. McIntyre stood as an independent in the 2013 Australian Federal Election for the Division of New England, the seat that Tony Windsor represented, but Tony Windsor did not stand. The seat was won by Barnaby Joyce representing the National Party of Australia. McIntyre gained 6059 votes (6.6%). On 30 April 2018, the party was formally issued a notice that the Australian Electoral Commission was considering deregistering the party on the grounds that it had failed to maintain a minimum of 500 members. On 6 June 2018, the party was deregistered by the AEC for failure to respond to the notice.

They were built to defend Gothenburg which was Sweden's only direct access to the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean. History Gothenburg was founded in 1621 at the direction of King Gustav II Adolf. Construction beginning in 1624 under the leadership of engineers, Captain Johan Schultz (Schouten) and Johan Jacobssen Kuyl (Kuhl), following a design by chief engineer Johan Rodenburg. The works were based upon the well-established Dutch school of fortification. When military engineer Erik Dahlberg (1625‚Äì1703) took responsibility for Sweden's fortifications in 1676 he implemented the wishes of King Karl XI for modern bastions of high wall construction. The ramparts were lined with walls of blasted rock and the fortified town of Gothenburg developed with 13 polygonal bastions and accompanying moat, ravelins and 3 city gates (Kungsporten; Nya porten, later renamed Drottningporten; and Karlsporten/H√•llg√•rdsporten). Gothenburg was growing rapidly by the end of the 1700s while the fortifications had suffered from poor maintenance. Demolition of the fortifications began in 1807, and was completed within ten years.

Montgomerieston was named for the Montgomerie family, Earls of Eglinton. History The Earls of Eglinton The remains of the old Citadel Gate. Under Oliver Cromwell five citadels were built in Scotland to control the Scots, such as at Leith, Perth, Inverlochy, Ayr and Inverness, with Ayr being the largest.Caldwell, Page 153AA&NHS;, Page 4 The Ayr Citadel, built 1652-1653,Love, Page 253 was designed by the Dutch architect named Hans Ewald Tessin; it was constructed to a hexagonal plan with six bastions.Campbell, Page 133 Construction was far from easy with the sand substrate collapsing into pits and water flooding the workings.Paterson, Page 19 It had a moat filled with freshwater around it, 90 ft across at the curtain walls and 50 ft across at the bastions. The fort contained two or three 'bomb proof' magazines, one of which is said to have served as a gate.Grose, Page 196 After 1660 the citadel had been partly dismantled to prevent its use by persons hostile to King Charles II, although the moat was not infilled until around 1800. Wells were dug to provide an independent water supply for the soldiers.Cuthbertson, Page 56 The seaward side of the fortifications were kept, possibly for use as a battery should the need arise.Dodd, Page 333 After the restoration of the monarchy under King Charles II these citadels were erected as burghs. As recompense for the losses incurred by the Earl of Eglinton through his support of King Charles I the citadel at Ayr, as a burgh of regality and barony was given to the 7th Earl, Hugh who christened it 'Montgomerieston' after his family's name. An additional reason for the gift to the Montgomerie family was that as Barons of Ardrossan much of their castle at Ardrossan had been dismantled and shipped to Ayr to supply stone to build the citadel in the first place. The stone is of a similar type to that of Ardrossan Castle and the speed at which the citadel was constructed suggests that a ready supply of quarried stone was available. The cost of the construction was such that Cromwell is said to have commented Has it been built of Gold? Some of the stones carry mason's marks.Caldwell, Page 154 This creation in 1663 of the burgh of 'Montgomeriestoun' as it was originally spelt, had been totally opposed by the magistrates of the town.Dunlop, Page 82 As a partial payment for a debt the burgh was later passed to the Kennedy family. A lasting benefit of the construction of the citadel was that it protected the church and the town from the ever present danger of inundation by blown sand.Dodd, Page 327 Baron Muir One of the six bastions and Miller's Folly. The Provost of Ayr, John Muir, and others, purchased the Barony of Montgomerieston from Lord Alexander Montgomerie in 1687, together with its 'liberties and pertinents'.paterson, Page 23 Baroness Susanna Montgomerie In 1727 the barony was purchased for Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton by Captain Nugent. Some privileges were retained by the provost for in 1747 objections were made to the countess having restricted access across the old moat, thereby preventing the people of Ayr from walking where they wished.paterson, Page 24 The Kennedy barons In 1755, Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton, who was from the Kennedy family of Culzean Castle sold the barony to a relation to whom she owed ¬£700, Sir Thomas Kennedy, later the 9th Earl of Cassillis. The property remained largely unchanged until 1854 when John Miller purchased it. Baron Miller In the 1850s an antiquarian and gunsmith called John Miller returned to Ayrshire from Calcutta where he had made his fortune. Miller purchased the Barony of Montgomerieston and built a Gothic style residence for himself using the tower of St John's church as its centrepiece. He also added an extension to a pre- existing corbelled turret at the end of one of the bastions which is known today as 'Miller's Folly', although the lower courses may be original.Brash, Page 24 A somewhat eccentric character, John Miller styled himself as 'Baron Miller' of Montgomerieston. After having sold off much of the 16 or 17 acres of the 'estate' for residential development, Miller died in 1910 and in 1914 the 3rd Marquess of Bute purchased what was left of the barony and St John's Tower was restored by the 4th Marquess; the 5th Marquess presented it to the Royal Burgh of Ayr in 1949.South Ayrshire History Retrieved : 2013-04-18 St John the Baptist's church St John's Tower St John's Tower and citadel gate in 1790 First mentioned in 1233 this was the medieval church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, patron saint of Ayr.AA&NHS;, Page 18 The church was used by Cromwell's soldiers as a look-out tower as well as an armoury and chapel, the congregation had been forced out and the Auld Kirk of Ayr came to be built to house them with some financial assistance from Cromwell. The 'Citadel' church was in public use again between 1687 and 1689, after which it ceased to be used for worship and much of it was demolished, the tower itself only being spared as it was a valuable sea-mark for sailors and a look-out for ships. Burials appear to have continued however judging from Francis Grose's comments in 1789 about new tombstones.Cuthbertson, Page 55 Following the sale of the barony to the Countess of Eglinton the town burgesses were very concerned about the condition of the tower and it was repaired with a flat roof added. The old Ayr castle stood nearby the church, within the walls of the citadel.Campbell, Page 126 John Miller built his 'Fort Castle' home around the tower and only in 1913-1914 was it restored to appear much like its original appearance as recorded by John Slezer in his 'Theatrum Scotiae',Close, Page 21 thanks to the 3rd and 4th Marquess's of Bute's interest in preserving ancient buildings. A ley tunnel is said to have run from St John's tower to Greenan Castle and in the 1950s reports circulated of the discovery of its entrance with stories of skeletons hanging in chains.MacArthur, Page 111 The Commercial past As a commercial venture pursued by the Earls of Eglinton to rival the Royal Burgh of Ayr itself, the burgh was never a great success.Campbell, Page 134 In 1662 the Earl of Eglinton was however given the rights by the Privy Council who in 1662 passed a special actMcJannet, Page 186 in his favour that gave the earl the right to the manual labour of all the vagrants and temporarily unemployed in Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Galloway. These individuals were taken to Montgomerieston where he had a wool factory. The heritors from the parishes had to support the labourers to the tune of ¬£6 Scots per month while they were there and the earl only had to provide food and clothing. If the heritors did not pay then the amount was to be taken from their estate funds. These rights lasted for 15 years for the vagrants and five years for the unemployed. Despite the low costs this business was not a success and it disappears from the records after a relatively short period of time,Lauchland, Page 27 the buildings being turned into a brewery. In the muniment records of Irvine it is recorded that the council agreed to pay for the maintenance of two 'poor boys' in 1664-1665 who were housed at the manufactory of Ayre alias Montgomeriestoun.A&GAA;, Page 213 The behaviour of the 'enslaved' workers was very poor and in 1665 the earl was urged to control their behaviour by the Archbishop of Glasgow. Montgomerieston brewery Eglinton Terrace. Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton during her period of ownership established a brewery here and it is also recorded that in 1734 whisky was being distilled here and that cinnamon and herbs were being used to produce drinks.Dunlop, Page 178 In 1754 tenants rented brewery buildings here and in 1787 the Ayr magistrates went to court to obtain payment of 'intown multure' against the brewery operators, McCracken & McConnell, however the right of thirlage was shown at the Court of Session to lie with the Earl and the independence of the Burgh of Montgomerieston was reaffirmed.Dunlop, Page 179 A kiln and a brewery was located here in the time of the time of Earls of Cassillis and it provided ¬£50 sterling rent per year.Cuthbertson, Page 57 Residential use In the 1850s Baron Miller laid out Montgomerieston as a residential area. His feu plan, produced by Clarke and BellClose (2012), Page 147 survives, however the square outline and circular central area layout was not followed.Close, Page 20 Street names appropriate to the history of the barony and burgh have been applied, such as Eglinton Terrace and Montgomerie Terrace for the first barons and later Cassillis Street and Ailsa Place for the Kennedy barons. Cromwell himself is remembered at Cromwell Road.AA&NHS;, Page 28 See also *Ardrossan Castle *Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton *Industry and the Eglinton Castle estate References ;Notes ;Sources # AA&NHC; (2001).

It is produced by Nestl√©, under their Nestl√© Dreyer's Ice Cream Company ice cream unit; branded under the Purina brand name. The Frosty Paws logo History Beginning ‚àí 1985 Frosty Paws were originally exclusively available in the original (Vanilla)-flavor ice cream cups. The ice cream cups were originally invented in the 1970s by Dr William Tyznik, a professor emeritus of animal science at The Ohio State University. Diane McIntyre, Nestl√© spokeswoman stated, \\"He was a regular visitor to his local ice cream parlour, where he often saw two elderly ladies feeding ice cream to their dogs. When he advised them that this was not the most suitable food for their pets, the ladies challenged him to create a dog-friendly alternative.\\" Tyznik sampled several various recipes with his own dogs. Finally, in 1979, with the help of two friends, Peter DeMarco and Dale Cook, Tyznik's decided to launch of the Vanilla flavor of Frosty Paws ice cream cups, under the first, and original brand name Pet79. The product was the first frozen treat for dogs ever introduced onto The United States market. Tyznik later went on to create and produce TizWhiz horse feed, and Cycle (dog food). By 1981, the brand's name was changed to Fido Freeze. 1985‚àípresent, Acquisition By Drumstick, and Nestl√© In 1985, Frosty Paws was acquired by the Drumstick Ice Cream Company for an undisclosed amount. Frosty Paws was owned by Drumstick for a total of six years. In 1991, Drumstick, along with the Frosty Paws brand was in turn acquired by Nestl√©. Nestl√© went on to introduce a Peanut Butter flavor of Frosty Paws ice cream cups in 2005, based on research carried out by its Purina PetCare Company division into dogs' preferred tastes. On August 19, 2011, Nestl√© unveiled Frosty Paws Bites, a line of bite-sized, which specially formulated for dogs, who are lactose intolerant and cannot properly digest dairy products such as normal ice cream. Frosty Paws Bites contain vitamins and minerals, and are milk-free. They are available in Vanilla or Peanut Butter flavors (as are the ice cream cup variety of Frosty Paws), and coated with vanilla yogurt (a major difference from the ice cream cup range, as they are not coated in vanilla yogurt), they are the second, and latest line of products from the Frosty Paws brand. About Frosty Paws produces and manufactures two product ranges. The first product range is Frosty Paws Ice Cream Cups, this was the first product line that the company created. It was first marketed as Pet79 Ice Cream Cups, then as Fido Freeze Ice Cream Cups. Originally, Frosty Paws did contain lactose, powdered milk, refined soy flour, corn oil, and fortified vitamins and minerals; it had a vitamin content higher than meat. Its original flavor was vanilla. Tyznik stated that: However, Frosty Paws does not currently contain lactose, as dogs are lactose intolerant animals, and cannot properly digest lactose. Thus, Frosty Paws products are also called frozen treats, instead of ice cream. Frosty Paws cups are available in original (vanilla), and peanut butter flavors. The cups are sold in cartons of four-cups. They are also available at warehouse clubs in large, club-packs. Frosty Paws peanut butter flavor was introduced in 2005. The second product range is Frosty Paws Bites. Introduced in 2011, Frosty Paws Bites are available in peanut butter, and original (vanilla) flavors. Frosty Paws Bites are also coated in vanilla yogurt. Similar to Frosty Paws Cups, Frosty Paws Bites are completely lactose free and are milk-free. Frosty Paws Bites are in very similar packages to Dibs Ice Cream, and each bite is about square in size. They are sold in packs of 50-individual bites. They are also available in club packs at warehouse clubs. Availability Currently, Frosty Paws products are only produced in North America, readily available throughout the United States and Canada. Some specialty pet stores in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, Australia, and Asia also carry the line.

Cast *Edward Furlong as Jack/Frank *Michael Berryman as Gunner *Kristin Booth as Penny *Dee Hannah as Mrs. Hatcher *Michael Eisner as Monty *Sadie Madu Production Writer Signe Olynyk developed writer's block whilst writing the film. In order to overcome it, she locked herself in a meat locker for five days to develop the story. In February 2010, it was revealed that director Justin Thomas Ostensen would start filming in March 2010 in Canada. Then in March, The Hills Have Eyes actor Michael Berryman was announced to appear in the film as Gunnar. Edward Furlong was also announced in April 2012. In the same month Kristin Booth, Michael Eisner, Sadie Madu and Dee Hannah were also added. Filming took place in Alberta, Canada. The film was originally titled Below Zero 3D but in January 2012, it was revealed the 3D had been dropped from the film. Release The world premiere was at the Calgary International Film Festival, 18 September 2011. The film had 31 official selections at film festivals, including: *A Night of Horror International Film Festival.

Reception Mike Saulters from Slackerwood.com gave a mixed review of the film, saying, \\"the story becomes a muddled mess that doesn't have a clear destination\\" and calls Kristin Booth's character \\"annoying as hell\\". However, Saulters praises the acting of Edward Furlong and Michael Berryman noting they are the \\"highlight of the movie\\". Martin Unsworth of Starburst rated the film with 8 out of 10 stars and wrote that he expected it to be a routine slasher film, but it turned out to be \\"fresh and surprising\\".

The award is sponsored by the International Society on Toxinology (ISI). Origin Osservazioni intorno alle vipere (Observations about the Viper) written by an Italian polymath Francesco Redi in 1664 is regarded as the milestone in the beginning of toxinology research. Redi was the first scientist to elucidate the scientific basis of snakebite and venom of the viper. He showed for the first time that the viper venom comes from the fang, not the gallbladder as it was believed; that it is not poisonous when swallowed, and effective only when it enters the bloodstream. He even demonstrated the possibility of slowing down the venom action in the blood by tight ligature before the wound. This work is heralded as the foundation of toxinology. In honour of the pioneer, the International Society on Toxinology (ISI) instituted the Redi Award in 1967 in recognition of scientists for their significant contributions in toxinology research. Nature of the award The IST awards scientists or clinicians who have made outstanding contributions to the field of toxinology. The award is given at each World Congress of the Society, which is generally held every three years. It is the highest award bestowed by the society and the most prestigious in the world for toxinologists. Selection for the award is made by the Redi Award Committee chaired by the editor of Toxicon (the official journal of IST) and accompanied by past and present Executive Officers of the society and former Redi awardees. The result is only announced at the World Congress. The recipient is then invited to present a lecture of his/her own choosing, officially called the Redi Lecture, to the congress. The Award consists of a framed citation describing the merits of the awardee and a financial assistance to help cover expenses associated with attendance at the meeting.

Frederick St John (20 December 1765 ‚Äî 19 November 1844The Peerage) was an officer of the British Army and a politician.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790-1820, ed. R. Thorne, 1986 He rose to the rank of general during his career and saw service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and the Second Anglo-Maratha War. He also sat briefly for the constituency of Oxford.  Family and early life  Frederick St John was born the second son of Frederick St John, 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke and Lady Diana Beauclerk. St John enlisted in the Army as an ensign in the 85th Regiment of Foot in 1779, at the age of 14. He served in the Indies and the Channel Islands until 1783. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1780, and then became a captain in the 95th Regiment of Foot in 1781. This was followed by a promotion to be major in the 104th Regiment of Foot in 1783. In parallel to his military career, he socialised in exclusive gentlemen's clubs: he joined Brooks's on 17 May 1783, and the Whig Club on 6 March 1787. He continued to rise through the ranks, becoming a lieutenant-colonel in the 2nd Regiment of Foot in 1791, a colonel in 1795, and being promoted to major-general in 1798. French Revolutionary Wars St John served in Ireland in 1798 as the lieutenant of General Gerard Lake, and followed him to India when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the colony. In 1800, St John took passage with his wife, Arabella Craven, on the Queen, which caught fire and was destroyed while in harbour in Salvador.Gentleman's Magazine, 8 October 1800; quoted in Laughton, p.438-439 St John and his wife then joined the East Indiaman Kent to complete the journey. On 7 October, Kent was captured by the French privateer Confiance, under Robert Surcouf. St John was taken prisoner and exchanged. St John went on to take part in the Battle of Delhi in 1803, and in the siege of Agra. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1805, and general in 1814. Political career St John was elected to Parliament in 1818 as member for Oxford and represented the constituency until his defeat at the 1820 general election two years later. Family and issue St John married three times. His first wife was Lady Mary Kerr, the daughter of William Kerr, 5th Marquess of Lothian, whom he married on 8 December 1788.

Life  Xenia Hausner was born into a family of artists. Her father was the Austrian painter Rudolf Hausner, her sisters are the filmmaker Jessica and the costume designer Tanja Hausner. From 1972 to 1976, she studied stage design at the Academy of Arts in Vienna and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. From 1977 to 1992, she designed sets for theatre and opera at the Burgtheater in Vienna, Covent Garden in London, The√¢tre de la Monnaie in Brussels etc.Schmied, Wieland, Ed. Xenia Hausner: Heart Matters. New York: Forum Gallery, 2000. Since 1992, Xenia Hausner has been working exclusively as a painter and has participated in innumerable exhibitions at home and abroad. She lives and works in Berlin and Vienna.  Work   Stage sets  Her first stage sets were collages built from material collected from condemned houses, junk yards and garbage dumps. She used this raw material to assemble a theatrical space that sprung to life in the clash between naturalistic clarity and abstract interpretation.  Painting  As of 1990 Xenia Hausner began concentrating on painting. People are at the center of her focus. Her images are enigmatic, the situations she depicts ambiguous. Xenia Hausner's large-formatted works are societal descriptions, the situations purposely fragmentary, snapshots from daily life. In contrast to the classical portrait, the characters in her images play the roles of people other than themselves. They are cast like actors in a play. Her style is expressive and her palette brims over with strong colours, a fact that is apparent in the flesh tones of her protagonists. Xenia Hausner works on paper and mixed-media as well. She transforms large-formatted photos into paintings, incorporating various materials depending on the specific medium she is working in. In this way, painting and photography merge, are transported to the limits of current artistic awareness. Using a variety of techniques, she concentrates images and constructs a new reality. Producing special edition art works on hand-made paper has become a new field of experimentation for Hausner. These unique limited editions deal with subjects known from her paintings, but the images are reinvented through technique and the medium and evolve into an independent artistic form. While preparing for her exhibition, \\"Damage\\", at the Shanghai Art Museum in 2011, she became intensively interested in Asiatic, especially Chinese motifs and began incorporating them into her personal artistic DNA: clear evidence of the global networking in contemporary art.  Projects  She is active in the \\"Women without Borders\\" movement and its project SAVE (Sisters Against Violent Extremism), that focuses on the world, especially on people in extreme situations. She is strongly interested in architectural projects, for example the mantling of the Ringturm in Vienna in 2011, or in designing church windows (Kilian Church in Heilbronn, St. Johannis Church in Gehrden, St. Johannes and St. Laurentius Cathedral in Merseburg).

By the Koecher‚ÄìVinberg theorem these correspond to the cone of squares in finite- dimensional real Euclidean Jordan algebras, originally studied and classified by . The tube domain associated with a symmetric cone is a noncompact Hermitian symmetric space of tube type. All the algebraic and geometric structures associated with the symmetric space can be expressed naturally in terms of the Jordan algebra. The other irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type correspond to Siegel domains of the second kind. These can be described in terms of more complicated structures called Jordan triple systems, which generalize Jordan algebras without identity.This article uses as its main sources , and , adopting the terminology and some simplifications from the latter. Definitions A convex cone C in a finite-dimensional real inner product space V is a convex set invariant under multiplication by positive scalars. It spans the subspace C ‚Äì C and the largest subspace it contains is C ‚à© (‚àíC). It spans the whole space if and only if it contains a basis. Since the convex hull of the basis is a polytope with non-empty interior, this happens if and only if C has non-empty interior. The interior in this case is also a convex cone. Moreover, an open convex cone coincides with the interior of its closure, since any interior point in the closure must lie in the interior of some polytope in the original cone. A convex cone is said to be proper if its closure, also a cone, contains no subspaces. Let C be an open convex cone. Its dual is defined as :\\\\displaystyle{C^*={X: (X,Y) > 0\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mathrm{for}\\\\,\\\\,Y \\\\in \\\\overline{C}}.} It is also an open convex cone and C** = C. An open convex cone C is said to be self-dual if C* = C. It is necessarily proper, since it does not contain 0, so cannot contain both X and ‚àíX. The automorphism group of an open convex cone is defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathrm{Aut}\\\\,C ={g\\\\in \\\\mathrm{GL}(V) gC=C}.} Clearly g lies in Aut C if and only if g takes the closure of C onto itself. So Aut C is a closed subgroup of GL(V) and hence a Lie group. Moreover, Aut C* = (Aut C)*, where g* is the adjoint of g. C is said to be homogeneous if Aut C acts transitively on C. The open convex cone C is called a symmetric cone if it is self-dual and homogeneous. Group theoretic properties *If C is a symmetric cone, then Aut C is closed under taking adjoints. *The identity component Aut0 C acts transitively on C. *The stabilizers of points are maximal compact subgroups, all conjugate, and exhaust the maximal compact subgroups of Aut C. *In Aut0 C the stabilizers of points are maximal compact subgroups, all conjugate, and exhaust the maximal compact subgroups of Aut0 C. *The maximal compact subgroups of Aut0 C are connected. *The component group of Aut C is isomorphic to the component group of a maximal compact subgroup and therefore finite. *Aut C ‚à© O(V) and Aut0 C ‚à© O(V) are maximal compact subgroups in Aut C and Aut0 C. * C is naturally a Riemannian symmetric space isomorphic to G / K where G = Aut0 C. The Cartan involution is defined by œÉ(g)=(g*)‚àí1, so that K = G ‚à© O(V). Spectral decomposition in a Euclidean Jordan algebra Pascual Jordan John von Neumann Eugene Wigner In their classic paper, studied and completely classified a class of finite-dimensional Jordan algebras, that are now called either Euclidean Jordan algebras or formally real Jordan algebras. Definition Let E be a finite-dimensional real vector space with a symmetric bilinear product operation :\\\\displaystyle{E\\\\times E \\\\rightarrow E,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, a,b\\\\mapsto ab =ba,} with an identity element 1 such that a1 = a for a in A and a real inner product (a,b) for which the multiplication operators L(a) defined by L(a)b = ab on E are self-adjoint and satisfy the Jordan relation :\\\\displaystyle{L(a)L(a^2)=L(a^2)L(a).} As will turn out below, the condition on adjoints can be replaced by the equivalent condition that the trace form Tr L(ab) defines an inner product. The trace form has the advantage of being manifestly invariant under automorphisms of the Jordan algebra, which is thus a closed subgroup of O(E) and thus a compact Lie group. In practical examples, however, it is often easier to produce an inner product for which the L(a) are self-adjoint than verify directly positive-definiteness of the trace form. (The equivalent original condition of Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner was that if a sum of squares of elements vanishes then each of those elements has to vanish.For a proof of equivalence see: *, Theorem 12 *) Power associativity From the Jordan condition it follows that the Jordan algebra is power associative, i.e. the Jordan subalgebra generated by any single element a in E is actually an associative commutative algebra. Thus, defining an inductively by an = a (an‚àí1), the following associativity relation holds: :\\\\displaystyle{a^m a^n = a^{m+n},} so the subalgebra can be identified with R[a], polynomials in a. In fact polarizing of the Jordan relation‚Äîreplacing a by a + tb and taking the coefficient of t‚Äîyields :\\\\displaystyle{2L(ab)L(a) + L(a^2)L(b)=2L(a)L(b)L(a) + L(a^2b).} This identity implies that L(am) is a polynomial in L(a) and L(a2) for all m. In fact, assuming the result for lower exponents than m, :\\\\displaystyle{a^2 a^{m-1} =a^{m-1}(a^2)=L(a^{m-1})L(a)a=L(a)L(a^{m-1})a=L(a)a^m=a^{m+1}.} Setting b = am ‚Äì 1 in the polarized Jordan identity gives: :\\\\displaystyle{L(a^{m+1})=2L(a^m)L(a)+L(a^2)L(a^{m-1})-2L(a)^2L(a^{m-1}),} a recurrence relation showing inductively that L(am + 1) is a polynomial in L(a) and L(a2). Consequently, if power-associativity holds when the first exponent is ‚â§ m, then it also holds for m+1 since :\\\\displaystyle{L(a^{m+1})a^n=2L(a)L(a^m)a^n+ L(a^2)L(a^{m-1})a^n -2L(a)^2L(a^{m-1})a^n =a^{m+n+1}.} Idempotents and rank An element e in E is called an idempotent if e2 = e. Two idempotents are said to be orthogonal if ef = 0. This is equivalent to orthogonality with respect to the inner product, since (ef,ef) = (e,f). In this case g = e + f is also an idempotent. An idempotent g is called primitive or minimal if it cannot be written as a sum of non-zero orthogonal idempotents. If e1, ..., em are pairwise orthogonal idempotents then their sum is also an idempotent and the algebra they generate consists of all linear combinations of the ei. It is an associative algebra. If e is an idempotent, then 1 ‚àí e is an orthogonal idempotent. An orthogonal set of idempotents with sum 1 is said to be a complete set or a partition of 1. If each idempotent in the set is minimal it is called a Jordan frame. Since the number of elements in any orthogonal set of idempotents is bounded by dim E, Jordan frames exist. The maximal number of elements in a Jordan frame is called the rank r of E. Spectral decomposition The spectral theorem states that any element a can be uniquely written as :\\\\displaystyle{a=\\\\sum \\\\lambda_i e_i,} where the idempotents ei's are a partition of 1 and the Œªi, the eigenvalues of a, are real and distinct. In fact let E0 = R[a] and let T be the restriction of L(a) to E0. T is self-adjoint and has 1 as a cyclic vector. So the commutant of T consists of polynomials in T (or a). By the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators, :\\\\displaystyle{T=\\\\sum \\\\lambda_i P_i} where the Pi are orthogonal projections on E0 with sum I and the Œªi's are the distinct real eigenvalues of T. Since the Pi's commute with T and are self-adjoint, they are given by multiplication elements ei of R[a] and thus form a partition of 1. Uniqueness follows because if fi is a partition of 1 and a = ‚àë Œºi fi, then with p(t)=‚àè (t - Œºj) and pi = p/(t ‚àí Œºi), fi = pi(a)/pi(Œºi). So the fi's are polynomials in a and uniqueness follows from uniqueness of the spectral decomposition of T. The spectral theorem implies that the rank is independent of the Jordan frame. For a Jordan frame with k minimal idempotents can be used to construct an element a with k distinct eigenvalues. As above the minimal polynomial p of a has degree k and R[a] has dimension k. Its dimension is also the largest k such that Fk(a) ‚â† 0 where Fk(a) is the determinant of a Gram matrix: :\\\\displaystyle{F_k(a)=\\\\det_{0\\\\le m,n< k} (a^m,a^n).} So the rank r is the largest integer k for which Fk is not identically zero on E. In this case, as a non-vanishing polynomial, Fr is non- zero on an open dense subset of E. the regular elements. Any other a is a limit of regular elements a(n). Since the operator norm of L(x) gives an equivalent norm on E, a standard compactness argument shows that, passing to a subsequence if necessary, the spectral idempotents of the a(n) and their corresponding eigenvalues are convergent. The limit of Jordan frames is a Jordan frame, since a limit of non-zero idempotents yields a non-zero idempotent by continuity of the operator norm. It follows that every Jordan frame is made up of r minimal idempotents. If e and f are orthogonal idempotents, the spectral theorem shows that e and f are polynomials in a = e ‚àí f, so that L(e) and L(f) commute. This can be seen directly from the polarized Jordan identity which implies L(e)L(f) = 2 L(e)L(f)L(e). Commutativity follows by taking adjoints. Spectral decomposition for an idempotent If e is a non-zero idempotent then the eigenvalues of L(e) can only be 0, 1/2 and 1, since taking a = b = e in the polarized Jordan identity yields :\\\\displaystyle{2L(e)^3-3L(e)^2 +L(e)=0.} In particular the operator norm of L(e) is 1 and its trace is strictly positive. There is a corresponding orthogonal eigenspace decomposition of E :\\\\displaystyle{E=E_0(e)\\\\oplus E_{1/2}(e) \\\\oplus E_1(e),} where, for a in E, EŒª(a) denotes the Œª-eigenspace of L(a). In this decomposition E1(e) and E0(e) are Jordan algebras with identity elements e and 1 ‚àí e. Their sum E1(e) ‚äï E0(e) is a direct sum of Jordan algebras in that any product between them is zero. It is the centralizer subalgebra of e and consists of all a such that L(a) commutes with L(e). The subspace E1/2(e) is a module for the centralizer of e, the centralizer module, and the product of any two elements in it lies in the centralizer subalgebra. On the other hand, if :\\\\displaystyle{U=8L(e)^2 -8L(e) +I,} then U is self-adjoint equal to 1 on the centralizer algebra and ‚àí1 on the centralizer module. So U2 = I and the properties above show that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sigma(x) = Ux} defines an involutive Jordan algebra automorphism œÉ of E. In fact the Jordan algebra and module properties follow by replacing a and b in the polarized Jordan identity by e and a. If ea = 0, this gives L(e)L(a) = 2L(e)L(a)L(e). Taking adjoints it follows that L(a) commutes with L(e). Similarly if (1 ‚àí e)a = 0, L(a) commutes with I ‚àí L(e) and hence L(e). This implies the Jordan algebra and module properties. To check that a product of elements in the module lies in the algebra, it is enough to check this for squares: but if L(e)a = ¬Ω a, then ea = ¬Ω a, so L(a)2 \\\\+ L(a2)L(e) = 2L(a)L(e)L(a) + L(a2e). Taking adjoints it follows that L(a2) commutes with L(e), which implies the property for squares. Trace form The trace form is defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\tau(a,b) = \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\, L(ab).} It is an inner product since, for non-zero a = ‚àë Œªi ei, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\tau(a,a)=\\\\sum \\\\lambda_i^2 \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\,L(e_i) > 0.} The polarized Jordan identity can be polarized again by replacing a by a + tc and taking the coefficient of t. A further anyisymmetrization in a and c yields: :\\\\displaystyle{L(a(bc) -(ab)c)= L(a),L(b)],L(c)].} Applying the trace to both sides :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\tau(a,bc)=\\\\tau(ba,c),} so that L(b) is self-adjoint for the trace form. Simple Euclidean Jordan algebras Adolf Hurwitz (1855‚Äì1919), whose work on composition algebras was published posthumously in 1923. The classification of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras was accomplished by , with details of the one exceptional algebra provided in the article immediately following theirs by . Using the Peirce decomposition, they reduced the problem to an algebraic problem involving multiplicative quadratic forms already solved by Hurwitz. The presentation here, following , using composition algebras or Euclidean Hurwitz algebras, is a shorter version of the original derivation. Central decomposition If E is a Euclidean Jordan algebra an ideal F in E is a linear subspace closed under multiplication by elements of E, i.e. F is invariant under the operators L(a) for a in E. If P is the orthogonal projection onto F it commutes with the operators L(a), In particular F‚ä• = (I ‚àí P)E is also an ideal and E = F ‚äï F‚ä•. Furthermore, if e = P(1), then P = L(e). In fact for a in E :\\\\displaystyle{ea=ae=L(a)P(1)=P(L(a)1)=P(a),} so that ea = a for a in F and 0 for a in F‚ä•. In particular e and 1 ‚àí e are orthogonal idempotents with L(e) = P and L(1 ‚àí e) = I ‚àí P. e and 1 ‚àí e are the identities in the Euclidean Jordan algebras F and F‚ä•. The idempotent e is central in E, where the center of E is defined to be the set of all z such that L(z) commutes with L(a) for all a. It forms a commutative associative subalgebra. Continuing in this way E can be written as a direct sum of minimal ideals :\\\\displaystyle{E=\\\\oplus E_i.} If Pi is the projection onto Ei and ei = Pi(1) then Pi = L(ei). The ei's are orthogonal with sum 1 and are the identities in Ei. Minimality forces Ei to be simple, i.e. to have no non-trivial ideals. For since L(ei) commutes with all L(a)'s, any ideal F ‚äÇ Ei would be invariant under E since F = eiF. Such a decomposition into a direct sum of simple Euclidean algebras is unique. If E = ‚äï Fj is another decomposition, then Fj=‚äï eiFj. By minimality only one of the terms here is non-zero so equals Fj. By minimality the corresponding Ei equals Fj, proving uniqueness. In this way the classification of Euclidean Jordan algebras is reduced to that of simple ones. For a simple algebra E all inner products for which the operators L(a) are self adjoint are proportional. Indeed, any other product has the form (Ta, b) for some positive self-adjoint operator commuting with the L(a)'s. Any non-zero eigenspace of T is an ideal in A and therefore by simplicity T must act on the whole of E as a positive scalar. List of all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras * Let Hn(R) be the space of real symmetric n by n matrices with inner product (a,b) = Tr ab and Jordan product a ‚àò b = ¬Ω(ab + ba). Then Hn(R) is a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank n for n ‚â• 3. * Let Hn(C) be the space of complex self-adjoint n by n matrices with inner product (a,b) = Re Tr ab* and Jordan product a ‚àò b = ¬Ω(ab + ba). Then Hn(C) is a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank n ‚â• 3. * Let Hn(H) be the space of self-adjoint n by n matrices with entries in the quaternions, inner product (a,b) = Re Tr ab* and Jordan product a ‚àò b = ¬Ω(ab + ba). Then Hn(H) is a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank n ‚â• 3. * Let V be a finite dimensional real inner product space and set E = V ‚äï R with inner product (u‚äïŒª,v‚äïŒº) =(u,v) + ŒªŒº and product (u‚äïŒª)‚àò(v‚äïŒº)=( Œºu + Œªv) ‚äï [(u,v) + ŒªŒº]. This is a Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank 2. *The above examples in fact give all the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, except for one exceptional case H3(O), the self-adjoint matrices over the octonions or Cayley numbers, another rank 3 simple Euclidean Jordan algebra of dimension 27 (see below). Peirce decomposition Let E be a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra with inner product given by the trace form œÑ(a)= Tr L(a). The proof that E has the above form rests on constructing an analogue of matrix units for a Jordan frame in E. The following properties of idempotents hold in E. *An idempotent e is minimal in E if and only if E1(e) has dimension one (so equals Re). Moreover E1/2(e) ‚â† (0). In fact the spectral projections of any element of E1(e) lie in E so if non-zero must equal e. If the 1/2 eigenspace vanished then E1(e) = Re would be an ideal. *If e and f are non-orthogonal minimal idempotents, then there is a period 2 automorphism œÉ of E such that œÉe=f, so that e and f have the same trace. *If e and f are orthogonal minimal idempotents then E1/2(e) ‚à© E1/2(f) ‚â† (0). Moreover, there is a period 2 automorphism œÉ of E such that œÉe=f, so that e and f have the same trace, and for any a in this intersection, a2 = ¬Ω œÑ(e) a2 (e + f). *All minimal idempotents in E are in the same orbit of the automorphism group so have the same trace œÑ0. *If e, f, g are three minimal orthogonal idempotents, then for a in E1/2(e) ‚à© E1/2(f) and b in E1/2(f) ‚à© E1/2(g), L(a)2 b = ‚Öõ œÑ0 a2 b and ab2 = ‚Öõ œÑ0 a2b2. Moreover, E1/2(e) ‚à© E1/2(f) ‚à© E1/2(g) = (0). *If e1, ..., er and f1, ..., fr are Jordan frames in E, then there is an automorphism Œ± such that Œ±ei = fi. *If (ei) is a Jordan frame and Eii = E1(ei) and Eij = E1/2(ei) ‚à© E1/2(ej), then E is the orthogonal direct sum the Eii's and Eij's. Since E is simple, the Eii's are one- dimensional and the subspaces Eij are all non-zero for i ‚â† j. *If a = ‚àë Œ±i ei for some Jordan frame (ei), then L(a) acts as Œ±i on Eii and (Œ±i \\\\+ Œ±i)/2 on Eij. Reduction to Euclidean Hurwitz algebras Let E be a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. From the properties of the Peirce decomposition it follows that: *If E has rank 2, then it has the form V ‚äï R for some inner product space V with Jordan product as described above. *If E has rank r > 2, then there is a non-associative unital algebra A, associative if r > 3, equipped with an inner product satisfying (ab,ab)= (a,a)(b,b) and such that E = Hr(A). (Conjugation in A is defined by a* = ‚àía + 2(a,1)1.) Such an algebra A is called a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra. In A if Œª(a)b = ab and œÅ(a)b = ba, then: * the involution is an antiautomorphism, i.e. * * , , so that the involution on the algebra corresponds to taking adjoints * if * * , , so that is an alternative algebra. By Hurwitz's theorem A must be isomorphic to R, C, H or O. The first three are associative division algebras. The octonions do not form an associative algebra, so Hr(O) can only give a Jordan algebra for r = 3. Because A is associative when A = R, C or H, it is immediate that Hr(A) is a Jordan algebra for r ‚â• 3. A separate argument, given originally by , is required to show that H3(O) with Jordan product a‚àòb = ¬Ω(ab + ba) satisfies the Jordan identity [L(a),L(a2)] = 0. There is a later more direct proof using the Freudenthal diagonalization theorem due to : he proved that given any matrix in the algebra Hr(A) there is an algebra automorphism carrying the matrix onto a diagonal matrix with real entries; it is then straightforward to check that [L(a),L(b)] = 0 for real diagonal matrices.See:  Exceptional and special Euclidean Jordan algebras The exceptional Euclidean Jordan algebra E= H3(O) is called the Albert algebra. The Cohn‚ÄìShirshov theorem implies that it cannot be generated by two elements (and the identity). This can be seen directly. For by Freudenthal's diagonalization theorem one element X can be taken to be a diagonal matrix with real entries and the other Y to be orthogonal to the Jordan subalgebra generated by X. If all the diagonal entries of X are distinct, the Jordan subalgebra generated by X and Y is generated by the diagonal matrices and three elements :\\\\displaystyle{Y_1=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & y_1\\\\0 & y_1^* & 0\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, Y_2=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & y_2^*\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\\\y_2 & 0 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, Y_3=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y_3 & 0\\\\ y_3^* & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}.} It is straightforward to verify that the real linear span of the diagonal matrices, these matrices and similar matrices with real entries form a unital Jordan subalgebra. If the diagonal entries of X are not distinct, X can be taken to be the primitive idempotent e1 with diagonal entries 1, 0 and 0. The analysis in then shows that the unital Jordan subalgebra generated by X and Y is proper. Indeed, if, if 1 ‚àí e1 is the sum of two primitive idempotents in the subalgebra, then, after applying an automorphism of E if necessary, the subalgebra will be generated by the diagonal matrices and a matrix orthogonal to the diagonal matrices. By the previous argument it will be proper. If 1 - e1 is a primitive idempotent, the subalgebra must be proper, by the properties of the rank in E. A Euclidean algebra is said to be special if its central decomposition contains no copies of the Albert algebra. Since the Albert algebra cannot be generated by two elements, it follows that a Euclidean Jordan algebra generated by two elements is special. This is the Shirshov‚ÄìCohn theorem for Euclidean Jordan algebras.See:  The classification shows that each non-exceptional simple Euclidean Jordan algebra is a subalgebra of some Hn(R). The same is therefore true of any special algebra. On the other hand, as showed, the Albert algebra H3(O) cannot be realized as a subalgebra of Hn(R) for any n.See:  Indeed, let œÄ is a real-linear map of E = H3(O) into the self- adjoint operators on V = Rn with œÄ(ab) = ¬Ω(œÄ(a)œÄ(b) + œÄ(b)œÄ(a)) and œÄ(1) = I. If e1, e2, e3 are the diagonal minimal idempotents then Pi = œÄ(ei are mutually orthogonal projections on V onto orthogonal subspaces Vi. If i ‚â† j, the elements eij of E with 1 in the (i,j) and (j,i) entries and 0 elsewhere satisfy eij2 = ei \\\\+ ej. Moreover, eijejk = ¬Ω eik if i, j and k are distinct. The operators Tij are zero on Vk (k ‚â† i, j) and restrict to involutions on Vi ‚äï Vj interchanging Vi and Vj. Letting Pij = Pi Tij Pj and setting Pii = Pi, the (Pij) form a system of matrix units on V, i.e. Pij* = Pji, ‚àë Pii = I and PijPkm = Œ¥jk Pim. Let Ei and Eij be the subspaces of the Peirce decomposition of E. For x in O, set œÄij = Pij œÄ(xeij), regarded as an operator on Vi. This does not depend on j and for x, y in O :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\pi_{ij}(xy) =\\\\pi_{ij}(x)\\\\pi_{ij}(y),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\pi_{ij}(1)= I.} Since every x in O has a right inverse y with xy = 1, the map œÄij is injective. On the other hand, it is an algebra homomorphism from the nonassociative algebra O into the associative algebra End Vi, a contradiction. Positive cone in a Euclidean Jordan algebra Max Koecher pioneered the use of Jordan algebras in studying symmetric spaces Definition When (ei) is a partition of 1 in a Euclidean Jordan algebra E, the self-adjoint operators L(ei) commute and there is a decomposition into simultaneous eigenspaces. If a = ‚àë Œªi ei the eigenvalues of L(a) have the form ‚àë Œµi Œªi is 0, 1/2 or 1. The ei themselves give the eigenvalues Œªi. In particular an element a has non-negative spectrum if and only if L(a) has non-negative spectrum. Moreover, a has positive spectrum if and only if L(a) has positive spectrum. For if a has positive spectrum, a - Œµ1 has non-negative spectrum for some Œµ > 0. The positive cone C in E is defined to be the set of elements a such that a has positive spectrum. This condition is equivalent to the operator L(a) being a positive self-adjoint operator on E. * C is a convex cone in E because positivity of a self-adjoint operator T‚Äî the property that its eigenvalues be strictly positive‚Äîis equivalent to (Tv,v) > 0 for all v ‚â† 0. * C is an open because the positive matrices are open in the self-adjoint matrices and L is a continuous map: in fact, if the lowest eigenvalue of T is Œµ > 0, then T + S is positive whenever S < Œµ. * The closure of C consists of all a such that L(a) is non-negative or equivalently a has non-negative spectrum. From the elementary properties of convex cones, C is the interior of its closure and is a proper cone. The elements in the closure of C are precisely the square of elements in E. * C is self-dual. In fact the elements of the closure of C are just set of all squares x2 in E, the dual cone is given by all a such that (a,x2) > 0. On the other hand, (a,x2) = (L(a)x,x), so this is equivalent to the positivity of L(a). Quadratic representation To show that the positive cone C is homogeneous, i.e. has a transitive group of automorphisms, a generalization of the quadratic action of self-adjoint matrices on themselves given by X ‚Ü¶ YXY has to be defined. If Y is invertible and self-adjoint, this map is invertible and carries positive operators onto positive operators. For a in E, define an endomorphism of E, called the quadratic representation, by :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a) = 2L(a)^2 - L\\\\left(a^2\\\\right).} Note that for self-adjoint matrices L(X)Y = ¬Ω(XY + YX), so that Q(X)Y = XYX. An element a in E is called invertible if it is invertible in R[a]. If b denotes the inverse, then the spectral decomposition of a shows that L(a) and L(b) commute. In fact a is invertible if and only if Q(a) is invertible. In that case Indeed, if Q(a) is invertible it carries R[a] onto itself. On the other hand, Q(a)1 = a2, so :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\left(Q(a)^{-1} a\\\\right)a = a Q(a)^{-1} a = L(a)Q(a)^{-1}a = Q(a)^{-1}a^2 =1.} Taking b = a‚àí1 in the polarized Jordan identity, yields :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)L\\\\left(a^{-1}\\\\right) = L(a).} Replacing a by its inverse, the relation follows if L(a) and L(a‚àí1) are invertible. If not it holds for a + Œµ1 with Œµ arbitrarily small and hence also in the limit. These identities are easy to prove in a finite-dimensional (Euclidean) Jordan algebra (see below) or in a special Jordan algebra, i.e. the Jordan algebra defined by a unital associative algebra. See: * * They are valid in any Jordan algebra. This was conjectured by Jacobson and proved in : Macdonald showed that if a polynomial identity in three variables, linear in the third, is valid in any special Jordan algebra, then it holds in all Jordan algebras.See: * * In fact for c in A and F(a) a function on A with values in End A, let DcF(a) be the derivative at t = 0 of F(a + tc). Then :\\\\displaystyle{c = D_c\\\\left(Q(a)a^{-1}\\\\right) = 2\\\\left[(L(a)L(c) + L(c)L(a) - L(ac))a^{-1}\\\\right] + Q(a)D_c\\\\left(a^{-1}\\\\right) = 2c + Q(a)D_c\\\\left(a^{-1}\\\\right).} The expression in square brackets simplifies to c because L(a) commutes with L(a‚àí1). Thus Applying Dc to L(a‚àí1)Q(a) = L(a) and acting on b = c‚àí1 yields :\\\\displaystyle{(Q(a)b)\\\\left(Q\\\\left(a^{-1}\\\\right)b^{-1}\\\\right) = 1.} On the other hand, L(Q(a)b) is invertible on an open dense set where Q(a)b must also be invertible with :\\\\displaystyle{(Q(a)b)^{-1} = Q\\\\left(a^{-1}\\\\right)b^{-1}.} Taking the derivative Dc in the variable b in the expression above gives :\\\\displaystyle{-Q(Q(a)b)^{-1}Q(a)c = -Q(a)^{-1}Q(b)^{-1}c.} This yields the fundamental identity for a dense set of invertible elements, so it follows in general by continuity. The fundamental identity implies that c = Q(a)b is invertible if a and b are invertible and gives a formula for the inverse of Q(c). Applying it to c gives the inverse identity in full generality. Finally it can be verified immediately from the definitions that, if u = 1 ‚àí 2e for some idempotent e, then Q(u) is the period 2 automorphism constructed above for the centralizer algebra and module of e. Homogeneity of positive cone The proof of this relies on elementary continuity properties of eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators.See:  Let T(t) (Œ± ‚â§ t ‚â§ Œ≤) be a continuous family of self-adjoint operators on E with T(Œ±) positive and T(Œ≤) having a negative eiegenvalue. Set S(t)= ‚ÄìT(t) + M with M > 0 chosen so large that S(t) is positive for all t. The operator norm S(t) is continuous. It is less than M for t = Œ± and greater than M for t = Œ≤. So for some Œ± < s < Œ≤, S(s) = M and there is a vector v ‚â† 0 such that S(s)v = Mv. In particular T(s)v = 0, so that T(s) is not invertible. Suppose that x = Q(a)b does not lie in C. Let b(t) = (1 ‚àí t) + tb with 0 ‚â§ t ‚â§ 1. By convexity b(t) lies in C. Let x(t) = Q(a)b(t) and X(t) = L(x(t)). If X(t) is invertible for all t with 0 ‚â§ t ‚â§ 1, the eigenvalue argument gives a contradiction since it is positive at t = 0 and has negative eigenvalues at t = 1. So X(s) has a zero eigenvalue for some s with 0 < s ‚â§ 1: X(s)w = 0 with w ‚â† 0. By the properties of the quadratic representation, x(t) is invertible for all t. Let Y(t) = L(x(t)2). This is a positive operator since x(t)2 lies in C. Let T(t) = Q(x(t)), an invertible self-adjoint operator by the invertibility of x(t). On the other hand, T(t) = 2X(t)2 \\\\- Y(t). So (T(s)w,w) < 0 since Y(s) is positive and X(s)w = 0. In particular T(s) has some negative eigenvalues. On the other hand, the operator T(0) = Q(a2) = Q(a)2 is positive. By the eigenvalue argument, T(t) has eigenvalue 0 for some t with 0 < t < s, a contradiction. It follows that the linear operators Q(a) with a invertible, and their inverses, take the cone C onto itself. Indeed, the inverse of Q(a) is just Q(a‚àí1). Since Q(a)1 = a2, there is thus a transitive group of symmetries: Euclidean Jordan algebra of a symmetric cone Construction Let C be a symmetric cone in the Euclidean space E. As above, Aut C denotes the closed subgroup of GL(E) taking C (or equivalently its closure) onto itself. Let G = Aut0 C be its identity component. K = G ‚à© O(E). It is a maximal compact subgroup of G and the stabilizer of a point e in C. It is connected. The group G is invariant under taking adjoints. Let œÉg =(g*)‚àí1, period 2 automorphism. Thus K is the fixed point subgroup of œÉ. Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be the Lie algebra of G. Thus œÉ induces an involution of \\\\mathfrak{g} and hence a ¬±1 eigenspace decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathfrak{k} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{p},} where \\\\mathfrak{k}, the +1 eigenspace, is the Lie algebra of K and \\\\mathfrak{p} is the ‚àí1 eigenspace. Thus \\\\mathfrak{p}‚ãÖe is an affine subspace of dimension dim \\\\mathfrak{p}. Since C = G/K is an open subspace of E, it follows that dim E = dim \\\\mathfrak{p} and hence \\\\mathfrak{p}‚ãÖe = E. For a in E let L(a) be the unique element of \\\\mathfrak{p} such that L(a)e = a. Define a ‚àò b = L(a)b. Then E with its Euclidean structure and this bilinear product is a Euclidean Jordan algebra with identity 1 = e. The convex cone coincides C with the positive cone of E. Since the elements of \\\\mathfrak{p} are self-adjoint, L(a)* = L(a). The product is commutative since [\\\\mathfrak{p}, \\\\mathfrak{p}] ‚äÜ \\\\mathfrak{k} annihilates e, so that ab = L(a)L(b)e = L(b)L(a)e = ba. It remains to check the Jordan identity [L(a),L(a2)] = 0. The associator is given by [a,b,c] = [L(a),L(c)]b. Since [L(a),L(c)] lies in \\\\mathfrak{k} it follows that L(a),L(c)],L(b)] = L([a,b,c]). Making both sides act on c yields :\\\\displaystyle{[a,b^2,c] = 2[a,b,c]b.} On the other hand, :\\\\displaystyle{([b^2,a,b],c)=(b^2(ba)-b(b^2a),c) =-(b^2,[a,b,c])} and likewise :\\\\displaystyle{([b^2,a,b],c)=(b,[a,b^2,c]).} Combining these expressions gives :\\\\displaystyle{([b^2,a,b],c) =0,} which implies the Jordan identity. Finally the positive cone of E coincides with C. This depends on the fact that in any Euclidean Jordan algebra E :\\\\displaystyle{Q(e^a)=e^{2L(a)}.} In fact Q(ea) is a positive operator, Q(eta) is a one-parameter group of positive operators: this follows by continuity for rational t, where it is a consequence of the behaviour of powers So it has the form exp tX for some self-adjoint operator X. Taking the derivative at 0 gives X = 2L(a). Hence the positive cone is given by all elements :\\\\displaystyle{e^{2a} =Q(e^{a})1= e^{2L(a)}1 = e^X\\\\cdot 1,} with X in \\\\mathfrak{p}. Thus the positive cone of E lies inside C. Since both are self-dual, they must coincide. Automorphism groups and trace form Let C be the positive cone in a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra E. Aut C is the closed subgroup of GL(E) taking C (or its closure) onto itself. Let G = Aut0 C be the identity component of Aut C and let K be the closed subgroup of G fixing 1. From the group theoretic properties of cones, K is a connected compact subgroup of G and equals the identity component of the compact Lie group Aut E. Let \\\\mathfrak{g} and \\\\mathfrak{k} be the Lie algebras of G and K. G is closed under taking adjoints and K is the fixed point subgroup of the period 2 automorphism œÉ(g) = (g*)‚àí1. Thus K = G ‚à© SO(E). Let \\\\mathfrak{p} be the ‚àí1 eigenspace of œÉ. *\\\\mathfrak{k} consists of derivations of E that are skew-adjoint for the inner product defined by the trace form. * L(a),L(c)],L(b)] = L([a,b,c]). *If a and b are in E, then D = [L(a),L(b)] is a derivation of E, so lies in \\\\mathfrak{k}. These derivations span \\\\mathfrak{k}. * If a is in C, then Q(a) lies in G. *C is the connected component of the open set of invertible elements of E containing 1. It consists of exponentials of elements of E and the exponential map gives a diffeomorphism of E onto C. * The map a ‚Ü¶ L(a) gives an isomorphism of E onto \\\\mathfrak{p} and eL(a) = Q(ea/2). This space of such exponentials coincides with P the positive self-adjoint elements in G. * For g in G and a in E, Q(g(a)) = g Q(a) g*. Cartan decomposition * G = P ‚ãÖ K = K ‚ãÖ P and the decomposition g = pk corresponds to the polar decomposition in GL(E). * If (ei) is a Jordan frame in E, then the subspace \\\\mathfrak{a} of \\\\mathfrak{p} spanned by L(ei) is maximal Abelian in \\\\mathfrak{p}. A = exp \\\\mathfrak{a} is the Abelian subgroup of operators Q(a) where a = Œ£ Œªi ei with Œªi > 0. A is closed in P and hence G. If b =Œ£ Œºi ei with Œºi > 0, then Q(ab)=Q(a)Q(b). * \\\\mathfrak{p} and P are the union of the K translates of \\\\mathfrak{a} and A. Iwasawa decomposition for cone If E has Peirce decomposition relative to the Jordan frame (ei) :\\\\displaystyle{E=\\\\bigoplus_{i\\\\le j} E_{ij},} then \\\\mathfrak{a} is diagonalized by this decomposition with L(a) acting as (Œ±i \\\\+ Œ±j)/2 on Eij, where a = ‚àë Œ±i ei. Define the closed subgroup S of G by :\\\\displaystyle{S={g\\\\in GgE_{ij}\\\\subseteq \\\\bigoplus_{(p,q)\\\\ge (i,j)} E_{pq}},} where the ordering on pairs p ‚â§ q is lexicographic. S contains the group A, since it acts as scalars on Eij. If N is the closed subgroup of S such that nx = x modulo ‚äï(p,q) > (i,j) Epq, then S = AN = NA, a semidirect product with A normalizing N. Moreover, G has the following Iwasawa decomposition: :\\\\displaystyle{G=KAN.} For i ‚â† j let :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}_{ij} ={X\\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}:[L(a),X]={1\\\\over 2}(\\\\alpha_i-\\\\alpha_j)X, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\mathrm{for}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, a=\\\\sum \\\\alpha_i e_i}.} Then the Lie algebra of N is :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{n}=\\\\bigoplus_{i Taking ordered orthonormal bases of the Eij gives a basis of E, using the lexicographic order on pairs (i,j). The group N is lower unitriangular and its Lie algebra lower triangular. In particular the exponential map is a polynomial mapping of \\\\mathfrak{n} onto N, with polynomial inverse given by the logarithm. Complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra Definition of complexification Let E be a Euclidean Jordan algebra. The complexification EC = E ‚äï iE has a natural conjugation operation (a + ib)* = a ‚àí ib and a natural complex inner product and norm. The Jordan product on E extends bilinearly to EC, so that (a + ib)(c + id) = (ac ‚àí bd) + i(ad + bc). If multiplication is defined by L(a)b = ab then the Jordan axiom :\\\\displaystyle{[L(a),L(a^2)]=0} still holds by analytic continuation. Indeed, the identity above holds when a is replaced by a + tb for t real; and since the left side is then a polynomial with values in End EC vanishing for real t, it vanishes also t complex. Analytic continuation also shows that all for the formulas involving power-associativity for a single element a in E, including recursion formulas for L(am), also hold in EC. Since for b in E, L(b) is still self-adjoint on EC, the adjoint relation L(a*) = L(a)* holds for a in EC. Similarly the symmetric bilinear form Œ≤(a,b) = (a,b*) satisfies Œ≤(ab,c) = Œ≤(b,ac). If the inner product comes from the trace form, then Œ≤(a,b) = Tr L(ab). For a in EC, the quadratic representation is defined as before by Q(a)=2L(a)2 ‚àí L(a2). By analytic continuation the fundamental identity still holds: :\\\\displaystyle{Q(Q(a)b)=Q(a)Q(b)Q(a),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,Q(a^m)=Q(a)^m \\\\,\\\\,(m\\\\ge 0).} An element a in E is called invertible if it is invertible in C[a]. Power associativity shows that L(a) and L(a‚àí1) commute. Moreover, a‚àí1 is invertible with inverse a. As in E, a is invertible if and only if Q(a) is invertible. In that case :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)^{-1}a=a^{-1},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, Q(a^{-1})=Q(a)^{-1}.} Indeed, as for E, if Q(a) is invertible it carries C[a] onto itself, while Q(a)1 = a2, so :\\\\displaystyle{(Q(a)^{-1} a)a=a Q(a)^{-1} a=L(a)Q(a)^{-1}a=Q(a)^{-1}a^2 =1,} so a is invertible. Conversely if a is invertible, taking b = a‚àí2 in the fundamental identity shows that Q(a) is invertible. Replacing a by a‚àí1 and b by a then shows that its inverse is Q(a‚àí1). Finally if a and b are invertible then so is c = Q(a)b and it satisfies the inverse identity: :\\\\displaystyle{(Q(a)b)^{-1}=Q(a^{-1})b^{-1}.} Invertibility of c follows from the fundamental formula which gives Q(c) = Q(a)Q(b)Q(a). Hence :\\\\displaystyle{c^{-1}=Q(c)^{-1}c=Q(a)^{-1}Q(b)^{-1} b= Q(a)^{-1}b^{-1}.} The formula :\\\\displaystyle{Q(e^a) = e^{2L(a)}} also follows by analytic continuation. Complexification of automorphism group Aut EC is the complexification of the compact Lie group Aut E in GL(EC). This follows because the Lie algebras of Aut EC and Aut E consist of derivations of the complex and real Jordan algebras EC and E. Under the isomorphism identifying End EC with the complexification of End E, the complex derivations is identified with the complexification of the real derivations. Structure groups The Jordan operator L(a) are symmetric with respect to the trace form, so that L(a)t = L(a) for a in EC. The automorphism groups of E and EC consist of invertible real and complex linear operators g such that L(ga) = gL(a)g‚àí1 and g1 = 1. Aut EC is the complexification of Aut E. Since an automorphism g preserves the trace form, g‚àí1 = gt. The structure groups of E and EC consist of invertible real and complex linear operators g such that :\\\\displaystyle{Q(ga)=gQ(a)g^t.} They form groups Œì(E) and Œì(EC) with Œì(E) ‚äÇ Œì(EC). *The structure group is closed under taking transposes g ‚Ü¶ gt and adjoints g ‚Ü¶ g*. *The structure group contains the automorphism group. The automorphism group can be identified with the stabilizer of 1 in the structure group. *If a is invertible, Q(a) lies in the structure group. *If g is in the structure group and a is invertible, ga is also invertible with (ga)‚àí1 = (gt)‚àí1a‚àí1. * If E is simple, Œì(E) = Aut C √ó {¬±1}, Œì(E) ‚à© O(E) = Aut E √ó {¬±1} and the identity component of Œì(E) acts transitively on C. * Œì(EC) is the complexification of Œì(E), which has Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{k}\\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{p}. * The structure group Œì(EC) acts transitively on the set of invertible elements in EC. * Every g in Œì(EC) has the form g = h Q(a) with h an automorphism and a invertible. The unitary structure group Œìu(EC) is the subgroup of Œì(EC) consisting of unitary operators, so that Œìu(EC) = Œì(EC) ‚à© U(EC). * The stabilizer of 1 in Œìu(EC) is Aut E. * Every g in Œìu(EC) has the form g = h Q(u) with h in Aut E and u invertible in EC with u* = u‚àí1. * Œì(EC) is the complexification of Œìu(EC), which has Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{k}\\\\oplus i \\\\mathfrak{p}. * The set S of invertible elements u such that u* = u‚àí1 can be characterized equivalently either as those u for which L(u) is a normal operator with uu* = 1 or as those u of the form exp ia for some a in E. In particular S is connected. * The identity component of Œìu(EC) acts transitively on S * g in GL(EC) is in the unitary structure group if and only if gS = S * Given a Jordan frame (ei) and v in EC, there is an operator u in the identity component of Œìu(EC) such that uv = ‚àë Œ±i ei with Œ±i ‚â• 0. If v is invertible, then Œ±i > 0. Given a frame in a Euclidean Jordan algebra E, the restricted Weyl group can be identified with the group of operators on arising from elements in the identity component of Œìu(EC) that leave invariant. Spectral norm Let E be a Euclidean Jordan algebra with the inner product given by the trace form. Let (ei) be a fixed Jordan frame in E. For given a in EC choose u in Œìu(EC) such that ua = ‚àë Œ±i ei with Œ±i ‚â• 0. Then the spectral norm a = max Œ±i is independent of all choices. It is a norm on EC with :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\a^*\\\\ = \\\\a\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\{a,a^*,a}\\\\ =\\\\a\\\\^3.} In addition a2 is given by the operator norm of Q(a) on the inner product space EC. The fundamental identity for the quadratic representation implies that Q(a)b ‚â§ a2b. The spectral norm of an element a is defined in terms of C[a] so depends only on a and not the particular Euclidean Jordan algebra in which it is calculated. The compact set S is the set of extreme points of the closed unit ball x ‚â§ 1. Each u in S has norm one. Moreover, if u = eia and v = eib, then uv ‚â§ 1. Indeed, by the Cohn‚ÄìShirshov theorem the unital Jordan subalgebra of E generated by a and b is special. The inequality is easy to establish in non-exceptional simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, since each such Jordan algebra and its complexification can be realized as a subalgebra of some Hn(R) and its complexification Hn(C) ‚äÇ Mn(C). The spectral norm in Hn(C) is the usual operator norm. In that case, for unitary matrices U and V in Mn(C), clearly ¬Ω(UV + VU) ‚â§ 1. The inequality therefore follows in any special Euclidean Jordan algebra and hence in general. On the other hand, by the Krein‚ÄìMilman theorem, the closed unit ball is the (closed) convex span of S.See and . By finite-dimensionality, every point in the convex span of S is the convex combination of n + 1 points, where n = 2 dim E. So the convex span of S is already compact and equals the closed unit ball. It follows that L(u) = 1, in the operator norm corresponding to either the inner product norm or spectral norm. Hence L(a) ‚â§ a for all a, so that the spectral norm satisfies :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\able \\\\acdot \\\\b\\\\.} It follows that EC is a Jordan C* algebra. Complex simple Jordan algebras The complexification of a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra is a simple complex Jordan algebra which is also separable, i.e. its trace form is non-degenerate. Conversely, using the existence of a real form of the Lie algebra of the structure group, it can be shown that every complex separable simple Jordan algebra is the complexification of a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. To verify that the complexification of a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra E has no ideals, note that if F is an ideal in EC then so too is F‚ä•, the orthogonal complement for the trace norm. As in the real case, J = F‚ä• ‚à© F must equal (0). For the associativity property of the trace form shows that F‚ä• is an ideal and that ab = 0 if a and b lie in J. Hence J is an ideal. But if z is in J, L(z) takes EC into J and J into (0). Hence Tr L(z) = 0. Since J is an ideal and the trace form degenerate, this forces z = 0. It follows that EC = F ‚äï F‚ä•. If P is the corresponding projection onto F, it commutes with the operators L(a) and F‚ä• = (I ‚àí P)EC. is also an ideal and E = F ‚äï F‚ä•. Furthermore, if e = P(1), then P = L(e). In fact for a in E :\\\\displaystyle{ea=ae=L(a)P(1)=P(L(a)1)=P(a),} so that ea = a for a in F and 0 for a in F‚ä•. In particular e and 1 ‚àí e are orthogonal central idempotents with L(e) = P and L(1 ‚àí e) = I ‚àí P. So simplicity follows from the fact that the center of EC is the complexification of the center of E. Symmetry groups of bounded domain and tube domain According to the \\"elementary approach\\" to bounded symmetric space of Koecher,See: * * Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type can be realized in the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra E as either the open unit ball for the spectral norm, a bounded domain, or as the open tube domain , where C is the positive open cone in E. In the simplest case where E = R, the complexification of E is just C, the bounded domain corresponds to the open unit disk and the tube domain to the upper half plane. Both these spaces have transitive groups of biholomorphisms given by M√∂bius transformations, corresponding to matrices in or . They both lie in the Riemann sphere }, the standard one-point compactification of C. Moreover, the symmetry groups are all particular cases of M√∂bius transformations corresponding to matrices in . This complex Lie group and its maximal compact subgroup act transitively on the Riemann sphere. The groups are also algebraic. They have distinguished generating subgroups and have an explicit description in terms of generators and relations. Moreover, the Cayley transform gives an explicit M√∂bius transformation from the open disk onto the upper half plane. All these features generalize to arbitrary Euclidean Jordan algebras.See: * * The compactification and complex Lie group are described in the next section and correspond to the dual Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. In this section only the symmetries of and between the bounded domain and tube domain are described. Jordan frames provide one of the main Jordan algebraic techniques to describe the symmetry groups. Each Jordan frame gives rise to a product of copies of R and C. The symmetry groups of the corresponding open domains and the compactification‚Äîpolydisks and polyspheres‚Äîcan be deduced from the case of the unit disk, the upper halfplane and Riemann sphere. All these symmetries extend to the larger Jordan algebra and its compactification. The analysis can also be reduced to this case because all points in the complex algebra (or its compactification) lie in an image of the polydisk (or polysphere) under the unitary structure group. Definitions Let be a Euclidean Jordan algebra with complexification . The unit ball or disk D in is just the convex bounded open set of elements such the a < 1, i.e. the unit ball for the spectral norm. The tube domain T in is the unbounded convex open set , where C is the open positive cone in . M√∂bius transformations The group SL(2,C) acts by M√∂bius transformations on the Riemann sphere C ‚à™ {‚àû}, the one-point compactification of C. If g in SL(2,C) is given by the matrix :\\\\displaystyle{g=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix},} then :\\\\displaystyle{g(z)=(\\\\alpha z +\\\\beta)(\\\\gamma z +\\\\delta)^{-1}.} Similarly the group SL(2,R) acts by M√∂bius transformations on the circle R ‚à™ {‚àû}, the one-point compactification of R. Let k = R or C. Then SL(2,k) is generated by the three subgroups of lower and upper unitriangular matrices, L and U', and the diagonal matrices D. It is also generated by the lower (or upper) unitriangular matrices, the diagonal matrices and the matrix :\\\\displaystyle{J=\\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}.} The matrix J corresponds to the M√∂bius transformation and can be written :\\\\displaystyle{J=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}.} The M√∂bius transformations fixing ‚àû are just the upper triangular matrices B = UD = DU. If g does not fix ‚àû, it sends ‚àû to a finite point a. But then g can be composed with an upper unitriangular matrix to send a to 0 and then with J to send 0 to infinity. This argument gives the one of the simplest examples of the Bruhat decomposition: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{SL}(2,k) = \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\cup \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\cdot J\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B},} the double coset decomposition of . In fact the union is disjoint and can be written more precisely as :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{SL}(2,k) = \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\cup \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\cdot J\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{U},} where the product occurring in the second term is direct. Now let :\\\\displaystyle{T(\\\\beta)=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & \\\\beta \\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}.} Then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\alpha^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix} = JT(\\\\alpha^{-1}) JT(\\\\alpha)JT(\\\\alpha^{-1}).} It follows is generated by the group of operators and J subject to the following relations: * is an additive homomorphism * is a multiplicative homomorphism  The last relation follows from the definition of . The generator and relations above is fact gives a presentation of . Indeed, consider the free group Œ¶ generated by J and with J of order 4 and its square central. This consists of all products for . There is a natural homomorphism of Œ¶ onto . Its kernel contain the normal subgroup Œî generated by the relations above. So there is a natural homomorphism of Œ¶/Œî onto . To show that it is injective it suffices to show that the Bruhat decomposition also holds in . It is enough to prove the first version, since the more precise version follows from the commutation relations between J and . The set is invariant under inversion, contains operators and J, so it is enough to show it is invariant under multiplication. By construction it is invariant under multiplication by B. It is invariant under multiplication by J because of the defining equation for . In particular the center of consists of the scalar matrices and it is the only non-trivial normal subgroup of , so that } is simple. In fact if is a normal subgroup, then the Bruhat decomposition implies that is a maximal subgroup, so that either is contained in or . In the first case fixes one point and hence every point of }, so lies in the center. In the second case, the commutator subgroup of is the whole group, since it the group is generated by lower and upper unitriangular matrices and the fourth relation shows that all such matrices are commutators since . Writing with in and in , it follows that . Since and generate the whole group, . But then . The right hand side here is Abelian while the left hand side is its own commutator subgroup. Hence this must be the trivial group and . Given an element a in the complex Jordan algebra , the unital Jordan subalgebra is associative and commutative. Multiplication by a defines an operator on which has a spectrum, namely its set of complex eigenvalues. If is a complex polynomial, then is defined in . It is invertible in if and only if it is invertible in , which happen precisely when does not vanish on the spectrum of . This permits rational functions of to be defined whenever the function is defined on the spectrum of . If and are rational functions with and defined on , then is defined on and . This applies in particular to complex M√∂bius transformations which can be defined by . They leave invariant and, when defined, the group composition law holds. (In the next section complex M√∂bius transformations will be defined on the compactification of .)See: * * Given a primitive idempotent in with Peirce decomposition :\\\\displaystyle{E=E_1(e)\\\\oplus E_{1/2}(e)\\\\oplus E_0(e),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, A=A_1(e)\\\\oplus A_{1/2}(e)\\\\oplus A_0(e).} the action of by M√∂bius transformations on can be extended to an action on A so that the action leaves invariant the components and in particular acts trivially on . If is the projection onto , the action is given be the formula :\\\\displaystyle{g(z e\\\\oplus x_{1/2} \\\\oplus x_0)={\\\\alpha z +\\\\beta \\\\over \\\\gamma z +\\\\delta}\\\\cdot e \\\\oplus (\\\\gamma z +\\\\delta)^{-1} x_{1/2} \\\\oplus x_0 - (\\\\gamma z + \\\\delta)^{-1}P_0(x_{1/2}^2).} For a Jordan frame of primitive idempotents , the actions of associated with different commute, thus giving an action of . The diagonal copy of gives again the action by M√∂bius transformations on . Cayley transform The M√∂bius transformation defined by :\\\\displaystyle{C(z)=i{1+z\\\\over 1-z}=-i +{2i\\\\over 1 - z}} is called the Cayley transform. Its inverse is given by :\\\\displaystyle{P(w)={w-i\\\\over w+i} = 1 -{2i\\\\over w+i}.} The inverse Cayley transform carries the real line onto the circle with the point 1 omitted. It carries the upper halfplane onto the unit disk and the lower halfplane onto the complement of the closed unit disk. In operator theory the mapping takes self-adjoint operators T onto unitary operators U not containing 1 in their spectrum. For matrices this follows because unitary and self-adjoint matrices can be diagonalized and their eigenvalues lie on the unit circle or real line. In this finite-dimensional setting the Cayley transform and its inverse establish a bijection between the matrices of operator norm less than one and operators with imaginary part a positive operator. This is the special case for of the Jordan algebraic result, explained below, which asserts that the Cayley transform and its inverse establish a bijection between the bounded domain and the tube domain . In the case of matrices, the bijection follows from resolvant formulas. In fact if the imaginary part of is positive, then is invertible since :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\(T+iI)x\\\\^2= \\\\(T-iI)x\\\\^2 + 4(\\\\mathrm{Im}(T)x,x).} In particular, setting , :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\y\\\\^2= \\\\P(T)y\\\\^2 + 4(\\\\mathrm{Im}(T)x,x).} Equivalently :\\\\displaystyle{I-P(T)^*P(T) = 4 (T^* -iI)^{-1}[\\\\mathrm{Im}\\\\,T] (T+iI)^{-1}} is a positive operator, so that P(T) < 1\\\\. Conversely if U < 1 then is invertible and :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathrm{Im}\\\\,C(U)=(2i)^{-1}[C(U)-C(U)^*] = (1-U^*)^{-1}[I -U^*U](I-U)^{-1}.} Since the Cayley transform and its inverse commute with the transpose, they also establish a bijection for symmetric matrices. This corresponds to the Jordan algebra of symmetric complex matrices, the complexification of . In the above resolvant identities take the following form:See: * * :\\\\displaystyle{Q(1-u^*)Q(C(u)+C(u^*))Q(1-u)=-4B(u^*,u)} and equivalently :\\\\displaystyle{ 4Q(\\\\mathrm{Im} \\\\,a) = Q(a^*-i)B(P(a)^*,P(a))Q(a+i),} where the Bergman operator is defined by with . The inverses here are well defined. In fact in one direction is invertible for u < 1: this follows either using the fact that the norm satisfies ab ‚â§ ab; or using the resolvant identity and the invertibility of (see below). In the other direction if the imaginary part of is in then the imaginary part of is positive definite so that is invertible. This argument can be applied to , so it also invertible. To establish the correspondence, it is enough to check it when is simple. In that case it follows from the connectivity of and and because: The first criterion follows from the fact that the eigenvalues of are exactly if the eigenvalues of are . So the are either all positive or all negative. The second criterion follows from the fact that if with and u in , then has eigenvalues . So the are either all less than one or all greater than one. The resolvant identity is a consequence of the following identity for and invertible :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)Q(a^{-1}+b^{-1})Q(b)=Q(a+b).} In fact in this case the relations for a quadratic Jordan algebra imply :\\\\displaystyle{R(a,b)=2Q(a)Q(a^{-1},b)=2Q(a,b^{-1})Q(b)} so that :\\\\displaystyle{B(a,b)=Q(a)Q(a^{-1}-b)=Q(b^{-1} -a)Q(b).} The equality of the last two terms implies the identity, replacing by . Now set and . The resolvant identity is a special case of the more following more general identity: :\\\\displaystyle{Q(1-x)Q(C(x)+C(y))Q(1-y)=-4B(x,y).} In fact :\\\\displaystyle{C(x)+C(y)=-2i(1-a^{-1} -b^{-1}),} so the identity is equivalent to :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)Q(1-a^{-1} -b^{-1})Q(b)=B(1-a,1-b).} Using the identity above together with , the left hand side equals . The right hand side equals . These are equal because of the formula . Automorphism group of bounded domain If lies in the bounded domain , then is invertible. Since is invariant under multiplication by scalars of modulus ‚â§ 1, it follows that is invertible for Œª ‚â• 1. Hence for a ‚â§ 1, is invertible for Œª > 1. It follows that the M√∂bius transformation is defined for a ‚â§ 1 and in . Where defined it is injective. It is holomorphic on . By the maximum modulus principle, to show that maps onto it suffices to show it maps onto itself. For in that case and its inverse preserve so must be surjective. If with in , then lies in . This is a commutative associative algebra and the spectral norm is the supremum norm. Since with œÇi = 1, it follows that where g(œÇi) = 1. So lies in . This is a direct consequence of the definition of the spectral norm. This is already known for the M√∂bius transformations, i.e. the diagonal in . It follows for diagonal matrices in a fixed component in because they correspond to transformations in the unitary structure group. Conjugating by a M√∂bius transformation is equivalent to conjugation by a matrix in that component. Since the only non-trivial normal subgroup of is its center, every matrix in a fixed component carries onto itself. Given an element in an transformation in the identity component of the unitary structure group carries it in an element in with supremum norm less than 1. An transformation in the carries it onto zero. Thus there is a transitive group of biholomorphic transformations of . The symmetry is a biholomorphic M√∂bius transformation fixing only 0. If is a biholomorphic self-mapping of with and derivative at 0, then must be the identity. If not, has Taylor series expansion with homogeneous of degree and . But then . Let be a functional in of norm one. Then for fixed in , the holomorphic functions of a complex variable given by must have modulus less than 1 for w < 1\\\\. By Cauchy's inequality, the coefficients of must be uniformly bounded independent of , which is not possible if . If is a biholomorphic mapping of onto itself just fixing 0 then if , the mapping fixes 0 and has derivative there. It is therefore the identity map. So for any Œ±. This implies g is a linear mapping. Since it maps onto itself it maps the closure onto itself. In particular it must map the Shilov boundary onto itself. This forces to be in the unitary structure group. The orbit of 0 under AD is the set of all points with . The orbit of these points under the unitary structure group is the whole of . The Cartan decomposition follows because is the stabilizer of 0 in . In fact the only point fixed by (the identity component of) KD in D is 0. Uniqueness implies that the center of GD must fix 0. It follows that the center of GD lies in KD. The center of KD is isomorphic to the circle group: a rotation through Œ∏ corresponds to multiplication by eiŒ∏ on D so lies in }. Since this group has trivial center, the center of GD is trivial. In fact any larger compact subgroup would intersect AD non-trivially and it has no non-trivial compact subgroups. Note that GD is a Lie group (see below), so that the above three statements hold with GD and KD replaced by their identity components, i.e. the subgroups generated by their one-parameter cubgroups. Uniqueness of the maximal compact subgroup up to conjugacy follows from a general argument or can be deduced for classical domains directly using Sylvester's law of inertia following .Note that the elementary argument in cited in is incomplete. For the example of Hermitian matrices over C, this reduces to proving that is up to conjugacy the unique maximal compact subgroup in . In fact if , then is the subgroup of preserving W. The restriction of the hermitian form given by the inner product on minus the inner product on . On the other hand, if is a compact subgroup of , there is a -invariant inner product on obtained by averaging any inner product with respect to Haar measure on . The Hermitian form corresponds to an orthogonal decomposition into two subspaces of dimension both invariant under with the form positive definite on one and negative definite on the other. By Sylvester's law of inertia, given two subspaces of dimension on which the Hermitian form is positive definite, one is carried onto the other by an element of . Hence there is an element of such that the positive definite subspace is given by . So leaves invariant and . A similar argument. with quaternions replacing the complex numbers, shows uniquess for the symplectic group, which corresponds to Hermitian matrices over R. This can also been see more directly by using complex structures. A complex structure is an invertible operator J with J2 = ‚àíI. preserving the symplectic form B and such that ‚àíB(Jx,y) is a real inner product. The symplectic group acts transitively on complex structures by conjugation. Moreover, the subgroup commuting with J is naturally identified with the unitary group for the corresponding complex inner product space. Uniqueness follows by showing that any compact subgroup K commutes with some complex structure J. In fact, averaging over Haar measure, there is a K-invariant inner product on the underlying space. The symplectic form yields an invertible skew-adjoint operator T commuting with K. The operator S = ‚àíT2 is positive, so has a unique positive square root, which commutes with K. So J = S‚àí1/2T, the phase of T, has square ‚àíI and commutes with K. Automorphism group of tube domain There is an Cartan decomposition for GT corresponding to the action on the tube T = E + iC: :\\\\displaystyle{G_T=K_T A_T K_T.} *KT is the stabilizer of i in iC ‚äÇ T, so a maximal compact subgroup of GT. Under the Cayley transform, KT corresponds to KD, the stabilizer of 0 in the bounded symmetric domain, where it acts linearly. Since GT is semisimple, every maximal compact subgroup is conjugate to KT. *The center of GT or GD is trivial. In fact the only point fixed by KD in D is 0. Uniqueness implies that the center of GD must fix 0. It follows that the center of GD lies in KD and hence that the center of GT lies in KT. The center of KD is isomorphic to the circle group: a rotation through Œ∏ corresponds to multiplication by eiŒ∏ on D. In Cayley transform it corresponds to the M√∂bius transformation z ‚Ü¶ (cz + s)(‚àísz + c)‚àí1 where c = cos Œ∏/2 and s = sin Œ∏/2. (In particular, when Œ∏ = œÄ, this gives the symmetry j(z) = ‚àíz‚àí1.) In fact all M√∂bius transformations z ‚Ü¶ (Œ±z + Œ≤)(‚àíŒ≥z + Œ¥)‚àí1 with Œ±Œ¥ ‚àí Œ≤Œ≥ = 1 lie in GT. Since PSL(2,R) has trivial center, the center of GT is trivial. * AT is given by the linear operators Q(a) with a = ‚àë Œ±i ei with Œ±i > 0. In fact the Cartan decomposition for follows from the decomposition for . Given in , there is an element in , the identity component of , such that with . Since z < 1, it follows that . Taking the Cayley transform of z, it follows that every in can be written , with the Cayley transform and in . Since with , the point is of the form with in . Hence . 3-graded Lie algebras Iwasawa decomposition There is an Iwasawa decomposition for GT corresponding to the action on the tube T = E + iC: :\\\\displaystyle{G_T=K_T A_T N_T.} *KT is the stabilizer of i in iC ‚äÇ T. * AT is given by the linear operators Q(a) where a = ‚àë Œ±i ei with Œ±i > 0. * NT is a lower unitriangular group on EC. It is the semidirect product of the unipotent triangular group N appearing in the Iwasawa decomposition of G (the symmetry group of C) and N0 = E, group of translations x ‚Ü¶ x + b. The group S = AN acts on E linearly and conjugation on N0 reproduces this action. Since the group S acts simply transitively on C, it follows that ANT=S‚ãÖN0 acts simply transitively on T = E + iC. Let HT be the group of biholomorphisms of the tube T. The Cayley transform shows that is isomorphic to the group HD of biholomorphisms of the bounded domain D. Since ANT acts simply transitively on the tube T while KT fixes ic, they have trivial intersection. Given g in HT, take s in ANT such that g‚àí1(i)=s‚àí1(i). then gs‚àí1 fixes i and therefore lies in KT. Hence HT = KT ‚ãÖA‚ãÖNT. So the product is a group. Lie group structure By a result of Henri Cartan, HD is a Lie group. Cartan's original proof is presented in . It can also be deduced from the fact the D is complete for the Bergman metric, for which the isometries form a Lie group; by Montel's theorem, the group of biholomorphisms is a closed subgroup.See:  That HT is a Lie group can be seen directly in this case. In fact there is a finite-dimensional 3-graded Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_T of vector fields with an involution œÉ. The Killing form is negative definite on the +1 eigenspace of œÉ and positive definite on the ‚àí1 eigenspace. As a group HT normalizes \\\\mathfrak{g}_T since the two subgroups KT and ANT do. The +1 eigenspace corresponds to the Lie algebra of KT. Similarly the Lie algebras of the linear group AN and the affine group N0 lie in \\\\mathfrak{g}_T. Since the group GT has trivial center, the map into GL(\\\\mathfrak{g}_T) is injective. Since KT is compact, its image in GL(\\\\mathfrak{g}_T) is compact. Since the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_T is compatible with that of ANT, the image of ANT is closed. Hence the image of the product is closed, since the image of KT is compact. Since it is a closed subgroup, it follows that HT is a Lie group. Generalizations Euclidean Jordan algebras can be used to construct Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type. The remaining Hermitian symmetric spaces are Siegel domains of the second kind. They can be constructed using Euclidean Jordan triple systems, a generalization of Euclidean Jordan algebras. In fact for a Euclidean Jordan algebra E let :\\\\displaystyle{L(a,b)=2([L(a),L(b)] + L(ab)).} Then L(a,b) gives a bilinear map into End E such that :\\\\displaystyle{L(a,b)^*=L(b,a)},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, L(a,b)c=L(c,b)a and :\\\\displaystyle{[L(a,b),L(c,d)]=L(L(a,b)c,d)-L(c,L(b,a)d).} Any such bilinear system is called a Euclidean Jordan triple system. By definition the operators L(a,b) form a Lie subalgebra of End E. The Kantor‚ÄìKoecher‚ÄìTits construction gives a one-one correspondence between Jordan triple systems and 3-graded Lie algebras :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathfrak{g}_{-1}\\\\oplus\\\\mathfrak{g}_0\\\\oplus\\\\mathfrak{g}_1,} satisfying :\\\\displaystyle{[\\\\mathfrak{g}_p,\\\\mathfrak{g}_q]\\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{g}_{p+q}} and equipped with an involutive automorphism œÉ reversing the grading. In this case :\\\\displaystyle{L(a,b) = \\\\mathrm{ad}\\\\,[a,\\\\sigma(b)]} defines a Jordan triple system on \\\\mathfrak{g}_{-1}. In the case of Euclidean Jordan algebras or triple systems the Kantor‚ÄìKoecher‚ÄìTits construction can be identified with the Lie algebra of the Lie group of all homomorphic automorphisms of the corresponding bounded symmetric domain. The Lie algebra is constructed by taking \\\\mathfrak{g}_0 to be the Lie subalgebra \\\\mathfrak{h} of End E generated by the L(a,b) and \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\pm 1} to be copies of E. The Lie bracket is given by :\\\\displaystyle{[(a_1,T_1,b_1),(a_2,T_2,b_2)]=(T_1a_2-T_2a_1,[T_1,T_2]+L(a_1,b_2)-L(a_2,b_1),T_2^*b_1-T_1^*b_2)} and the involution by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sigma(a,T,b)=(b,-T^*,a).} The Killing form is given by :\\\\displaystyle{B((a_1,T_1,b_1),(a_2,T_2,b_2))= (a_1,b_2) + (b_1,a_2) + \\\\beta(T_1,T_2),} where Œ≤(T1,T2) is the symmetric bilinear form defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\beta(L(a,b),L(c,d))=(L(a,b)c,d)=(L(c,d)a,b).} These formulas, originally derived for Jordan algebras, work equally well for Jordan triple systems.See:  The account in develops the theory of bounded symmetric domains starting from the standpoint of 3-graded Lie algebras. For a given finite-dimensional vector space E, Koecher considers finite-dimensional Lie algebras \\\\mathfrak{g} of vector fields on E with polynomial coefficients of degree ‚â§ 2. \\\\mathfrak{g}_{-1} consists of the constant vector fields ‚àÇi and \\\\mathfrak{g}_{0} must contain the Euler operator H = ‚àë xi‚ãÖ‚àÇi as a central element. Requiring the existence of an involution œÉ leads directly to a Jordan triple structure on V as above. As for all Jordan triple structures, fixing c in E, the operators Lc(a) = L(a,c) give E a Jordan algebra structure, determined by e. The operators L(a,b) themselves come from a Jordan algebra structure as above if and only if there are additional operators E¬± in \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\pm 1} so that H, E¬± give a copy of \\\\mathfrak{sl}_2. The corresponding Weyl group element implements the involution œÉ. This case corresponds to that of Euclidean Jordan algebras. The remaining cases are constructed uniformly by Koecher using involutions of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. Let E be a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra and œÑ a Jordan algebra automorphism of E of period 2. Thus E = E+1 ‚äï E‚àí1 has an eigenspace decomposition for œÑ with E+1 a Jordan subalgebra and E‚àí1 a module. Moreover, a product of two elements in E‚àí1 lies in E+1. For a, b, c in E‚àí1, set :\\\\displaystyle{L_0(a,b)c=L(a,b)c} and (a,b)= Tr L(ab). Then F = E‚àí1 is a simple Euclidean Jordan triple system, obtained by restricting the triple system on E to F. Koecher exhibits explicit involutions of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras directly (see below). These Jordan triple systems correspond to irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces given by Siegel domains of the second kind. In Cartan's listing, their compact duals are SU(p + q)/S(U(p) √ó U(q)) with p ‚â† q (AIII), SO(2n)/U(n) with n odd (DIII) and E6/SO(10) √ó U(1) (EIII). Examples *F is the space of p by q matrices over R with p ‚â† q. In this case L(a,b)c= abtc + cbta with inner product (a,b) = Tr abt. This is Koecher's construction for the involution on E = Hp + q(R) given by conjugating by the diagonal matrix with p digonal entries equal to 1 and q to ‚àí1. *F is the space of real skew-symmetric m by m matrices. In this case L(a,b)c = abc + cba with inner product (a,b) = ‚àíTr ab. After removing a factor of ‚àö(-1), this is Koecher's construction applied to complex conjugation on E = Hn(C). *F is the direct sum of two copies of the Cayley numbers, regarded as 1 by 2 matrices. This triple system is obtained by Koecher's construction for the canonical involution defined by any minimal idempotent in E = H3(O). The classification of Euclidean Jordan triple systems has been achieved by generalizing the methods of Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner, but the proofs are more involved.See:  Prior differential geometric methods of , invoking a 3-graded Lie algebra, and of , lead to a more rapid classification.

Politicians, commentators, and activists widely cited the paper in political debates over the effectiveness of austerity in fiscal policy for debt-burdened economies. The paper argues that when \\"gross external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP\\", a country's annual growth declined by two percent, and \\"for levels of external debt in excess of 90 percent\\" GDP growth was \\"roughly cut in half.\\" Appearing in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the evidence for the 90%-debt threshold hypothesis provided support for pro-austerity policies. In 2013, academic critics accused Reinhart and Rogoff of employing methodology that suffered from 3 major errors; they asserted that the underlying data did not support the authors' conclusions. These critics held that the Reinhart-Rogoff paper had led to unjustified adoption of austerity policies for countries with various levels of public debt.http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/53243/ Further papers by Rogoff and Reinhart, and the International Monetary Fund,World Economic and Financial Surveys, World Economic Outlook (WEO), Hopes, Realities, and Risks, April 2013, International Monetary Fund http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/index.htm which were not found to contain similar errors, reached conclusions similar to the initial paper, though with much lower impact on GDP growth. The threshold hypothesis retains adherents as well as critics, who suggest that the thresholds in the relation between public debt and economic growth lack robustness, so a consensus on the 90%-threshold hypothesis in the relation between public debt and economic growth has been elusive. Political influence In their critique of Reinhart and Rogoff's paper, University of Massachusetts Amherst economists Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin pointed out that \\"Growth in a Time of Debt\\" was influential on the United States Republican Party's budget proposal \\"The Path to Prosperity\\" (commonly referred to as the \\"Paul Ryan budget\\"): > RR 2010a [Growth in a Time of Debt] is the only evidence cited in the \\"Paul > Ryan Budget\\" on the consequences of high public debt for economic growth. > Representative Ryan's \\"Path to Prosperity\\" reports (Ryan 2013 p. 78): > >> A well-known study completed by economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart confirms this common-sense conclusion. The study found conclusive empirical evidence that gross debt (meaning all debt that a government owes, including debt held in government trust funds) exceeding 90 percent of the economy has a significant negative effect on economic growth. > > RR have clearly exerted a major influence in recent years on public policy > debates over the management of government debt and fiscal policy more > broadly. Their findings have provided significant support for the austerity > agenda that has been ascendant in Europe and the United States since 2010. Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs, in his address to the International Labour Organization on April 9, 2013, used the Reinhart-Rogoff paper to argue that \\"public debt in Europe is expected to stabilise only by 2014 and to do so at above 90% of GDP. Serious empirical research has shown that at such high levels, public debt acts as a permanent drag on growth.\\" British Member of Parliament George Osborne (who became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2010) relied on the paper to portray excess debt as the universal cause of financial crises: \\"As Rogoff and Reinhart demonstrate convincingly, all financial crises ultimately have their origins in one thing.\\" Methodological flaws The paper was published in an annual \\"Papers and Proceedings\\" edition of The American Economic Review that was not subject to the same peer-review standards that other editions use before publication.\\"Editor Talks Reinhart-Rogoff Excel Error\\", Business Insider, April 2013. Reinhart and Rogoff (RR) did not publish the data sample upon which they based their conclusions, but they made it available upon request to Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin (HAP), who then closely examined the data used in the study. Transcript of interview with Thomas Herndon and Michael Ash. In April 2013, HAP released a critique of the RR data analysis in the working paper \\"Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff\\", later published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics. They contend that the statistical analyses performed on the data in the original RR Excel spreadsheet (which were used to support the conclusions of the paper) were flawed: \\"While using RR's working spreadsheet, we identified coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\\" Using RR's working spreadsheet, but correcting for the claimed errors, HAP found: > When properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries > carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 > percent, not ‚àí0.1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogoff. That is, > contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent > is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower. HAP also concluded that the sample was biased, claiming that RR selectively omitted data for Australia, Canada, and New Zealand for the early post-World War II period, which showed high growth despite large public debts, while including data for the United States for the same period that showed negative GDP growth, which Herndon attributed to demobilization of U.S. military personnel. Also, by using only one year's data for New Zealand, a negative 7.6% GDP growth in 1951, a year in which New Zealand's trade suffered from a major strike, the average central tendency of the available 5 years (1946-1949 and 1951) shifted from 2.6% to -7.6%.Smith, Gary. Standard Deviations. page 62 HAP concluded that the \\"combination of the collapse of the empirical result that high public debt is inevitably associated with greatly reduced GDP growth and the weakness of the theoretical mechanism under current conditions, ... render the Reinhart and Rogoff point close to irrelevant for current public policy debate.\\" However, HAP's viewpoint has been criticized. RR published a lengthy, detailed response to HAP in The New York Times: > Herndon, Ash and Pollin accurately point out the coding error that omits > several countries from the averages in figure 2. Full stop. HAP are on > point.... HAP go on to note some other missing debt data points [New > Zealand], which they describe as \\"selective omissions.\\" This charge, which > permeates through their paper, is one we object to in the strongest > terms.... Data for New Zealand for the years around WWII had just been > incorporated and we had not vetted the comparability and quality data with > data for the more recent period.... They argue that we use an > \\"unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\\" In particular, for each > bucket, we take average growth rates for each country and then take an > average of the result. This seems perfectly natural to us, and hardly > unconventional. Economics professor L. Randall Wray criticized Reinhart and Rogoff for combining data \\"across centuries, exchange rate regimes, public and private debt, and debt denominated in foreign currency as well as domestic currency,\\" in addition to \\"statistical errors,\\" and for lacking a \\"theory of sovereign currency\\". Other critiques point out that any correspondence between debt levels and insufficient economic growth could just as easily be reversed: it is the weak economic growth that leads to the high debt levels.Dylan Matthews, writing in the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/08/why-do-people- hate-deficits/Arindrajit Dube (2013) Guest Post: Reinhart/Rogoff and Growth in a Time Before Debt. Next New Deal: The Blog of the Roosevelt Institute - http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/guest-post-reinhartrogoff-and-growth- time-debt Others have argued that the relationship between debt and growth varies significantly between countries, meaning that an average \\"rule\\", such as that suggested by Reinhart and Rogoff, has little meaning or policy relevance.Jones, K; Bell, A and Johnston, R (2013) Significant variation across countries means that simple conclusions regarding growth and debt, like those offered by Reinhart & Rogoff, have no policy relevance.

It is distinguished from the lowest court card, the Unter (lit. \\"under\\", formerly Untermann or \\"vassal\\", \\"subject\\", \\"subordinate\\"), by the figure's suit sign located in the upper range of the card. In the W√ºrttemberg pattern the Ober appears on horseback, as they were inspired by Cego decks whose face cards included a Knight or Cavalier as well as the Jack, Queen and King. The earliest description of playing cards in Europe comes from John of Rheinfelden in 1377. He describes the recent introduction of cards in his region. For decks he regards as common, beneath the seated King were two marshals (cavalry commanders), with one holding his suit sign up while the other held his hanging down. This corresponds with modern Obers and Unters with the exception that they are no longer mounted on horseback. Card decks that contain four Obers are used, for example, in Skat, Mau Mau, Bavarian Tarock and Schafkopf. By contrast, the decks used to play Gaigel and Doppelkopf have eight Obers. In Schafkopf, the four Obers are the highest trump cards, in Doppelkopf the eight Obers are the highest trump cards after the two 10s of hearts. In the Bavarian card game, Grasobern, tricks that contain the 'Grass Ober' (i.e. Ober of Leaves) are to be avoided.

A guarantor is a person who agrees to repay the borrower‚Äôs debt should the borrower default on agreed repayments. The guarantor is often a family member or trusted friend who has a better credit history than the person taking out the loan and the arrangement is, therefore, viewed as less risky by the lender. A guarantor loan can, consequently, enable someone to borrow either more money, or the same amount at a lower rate of interest, than they would otherwise be able to secure through a more traditional type of loan. Guarantors are often parents who want to help out their young adult children ‚Äì it could be help raising the deposit for their first home, or it could be to buy a new car or complete a training course that will help them on the next step of their career. There are many reasons why young people may need such help and the fact they cannot obtain a loan themselves does not mean that they are not financially responsible or able to pay back the loan. Guarantor loans are sometimes seen as alternatives to payday loans and associated with the sub-prime finance industry, due to them being aimed at people with a less than perfect credit score, because of missed payments towards debt in the past. However, this is only one aspect of guarantor loans. They are also aimed at young people who have no credit score, due to having never obtained credit in the past such as new graduates just embarking on their career - these people are often high earners with sensible financial habits so can afford the repayments but do not have the credit history to reassure the lender about the level of risk. As mainstream lending criteria is often automated and does not come with a personal review of the applicant's financial circumstances it is sometimes the only way a young adult in their first job can secure a loan. Although guarantors are a relatively new introduction to the unsecured loan market, it's not uncommon for people to be asked to provide a guarantor to co-sign other forms of financial agreement, such as in residential letting contracts, where young people without previous references are often required to provide a guarantor and in the mortgage industry, where guarantors are often used to help people obtain a mortgage when they would otherwise be declined due to being considered a credit risk. Since the global financial crisis that started in 2008 there has been rapid growth in a whole range of personal loans such as guarantor loans that might be classed as alternative loans. These are loans that are not obtained through the traditional sources of mainstream banks or other lending institutions such as building societies but more typically through loan brokers and niche lenders. There are many reasons why people are increasingly choosing less conventional borrowing but the biggest two, by far are lack of availability and cost. The strict lending criteria implemented since 2008 means that anyone with no credit history or an imperfect credit history either cannot secure a bank loan at all or will only be able to secure one at a high rate of interest. However, guarantor loans are by no means a panacea for this situation - they themselves have high interest rates significantly above standard personal loans (albeit over shorter time periods) and pose a risk to the guarantor who may not be aware of the full extent of the commitment they are undertaking. Anyone being asked to act as a guarantor on a loan should ensure they fully understand their own liability. These loans are sometimes used by angel investors to help out startup companies where the investor is unwilling or unable to provide direct funding. Although these loans can be used to help provide financially responsible individuals with lending they could not otherwise access, it is important to recognize that they still do carry significant risks for the guarantor, who is liable for the full debt amount should the borrower be unable to make repayment. A report suggests that these loans could be as damaging as payday loans, with 43% of guarantors in the study unclear about their financial liability. Consumer demographics Users of guarantor loans are often people who would be rejected by mainstream lenders, such as banks and credit card providers, due to having less than perfect credit scores or no credit history at all, such as young people just starting out in their first job. In the UK alone, for example, there are an estimated seven million consumers who would not be eligible for a bank loan because of their credit score or their lack of a credit history. Some guarantor loan companies aim to position themselves as a better alternative to payday loans, by offering loans at lower APRs than those offered by payday loan companies, whilst still higher than prime-credit consumers can access through mainstream banks.

The complex consists of: * Delta Hotel - originally a Holiday Inn and later a Crowne Plaza, is an 18-storey, 410-room hotel, with both indoor and outdoor swimming pools. It is located on the St. Mary Ave. side of the complex.

The park was established not only to provide a unifying centre for the complex but also to replace a city park that was displaced by construction of Lakeview Square. The hotel, which faces St. Mary's Cathedral (Roman Catholic), was once the site of St. Mary's School, which closed in 1968 and burned in 1969. The buildings of the complex are connected via various walkways and also through a common underground parking garage. Lakeview Square is connected to the Winnipeg Convention Centre by two skyways, one connecting to the Delta and the other connecting to One Lakeview Square. In 2010, Lakeview Square was newly connected to the main Winnipeg Walkway system with the completion of a skyway from 330 St. Mary Ave. to the Delta Hotel, utilizing a unique block-long exterior skyway running along the outside of the Delta on the St. Mary Ave. side.

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 18 May 2013. It was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Saul Metzstein. The episode was watched by 7.45 million viewers in the UK and received positive reviews from critics. In the episode, an entity called the Great Intelligence (Richard E. Grant) kidnaps Victorian-era detectives Madame Vastra (Neve McIntosh) and Jenny Flint (Catrin Stewart) and their butler Strax (Dan Starkey) to force their friend, time-travelling alien the Doctor (Matt Smith), to come to planet Trenzalore, the site of the Doctor's future grave. The Intelligence's plan is to trap the Doctor and then force the Doctor to open a door in time so the Intelligence can reverse all the Doctor's victories. Plot Mini-episodes and supplementary material \\"She Said, He Said\\" is a mini-episode that acts as a prelude to \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", in which the Eleventh Doctor and Clara each have a monologue about how little they know about each other and that they discovered each other's secret at Trenzalore. It was released on on BBC Red Button and online. Viewers using Red Button were able to access the prologue between 7:40 until midnight every evening, until \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" aired on . A second mini-episode, entitled \\"Clarence and the Whisper Men\\", depicts the imprisoned Victorian murderer Clarence DeMarco being threatened by the Whisper Men (whom he believes to be a figment of his deranged imagination) into learning a set of space-time coordinates - promising him, in return, a \\"long, full life\\", though one overshadowed by his fear of them. Also released to promote the episode were three \\"Strax Field Reports\\", in the first of which, subtitled \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", Strax informed the Sontarans of a great battle predicted to occur and admitting suspicions that it had to do with the Doctor's greatest secret. He informed Sontar that the operation was called \\"The Name of the Doctor\\". In the second, subtitled \\"A Glorious Day Is Almost Upon Us...\\", Strax discussed a 'glorious day' in which death was likely. The final field report ‚Äî \\"The Doctor's Greatest Secret\\" ‚Äî discussed the cliffhanger, commenting that this new Doctor had the appearance of a warrior. This was the only field report released after the episode. Synopsis In 1893, Madame Vastra and Jenny Flint are given information concerning the Doctor by Clarence DeMarco, in return for a stay on his execution. They use soporific drugs to hold a conference call through time and space between themselves, Strax, River Song, and Clara, in a dream. Vastra repeats DeMarco's words: \\"The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave, and it is discovered.\\" During their conference, eyeless humanoids called Whisper Men kidnap Vastra and Strax and kill Jenny. The Great Intelligence tells Clara to tell the Doctor that his friends are \\"lost\\" unless he goes to Trenzalore. The Doctor and Clara travel to Trenzalore, the planet holding his future grave, to save his friends. The planet is covered with tombstones, the result of a great war, while a future version of the TARDIS (having deteriorated and grown to enormous size) stands above the graveyard. The duo are attacked by Whisper Men. An echo of River, still telepathically linked to Clara, helps direct the two to an escape route that leads to the giant TARDIS. Strax, Vastra, and Jenny (who is revived by Strax) are awakened by Whisper Men and meet the Great Intelligence. The Great Intelligence threatens to kill the Doctor's allies unless the Doctor says his name to unlock the TARDIS doors. The Doctor refuses, but as he speaks, River says the Doctor's name and unlocks the TARDIS. Inside, the Doctor reveals a pulsating column of light to be his time stream. The Great Intelligence enters it in order to undo the Doctor's past as revenge for all the defeats it has been dealt. The positive effects of the Doctor's travels begin to be nullified by the Intelligence's interference. Jenny and Strax both disappear. Clara remembers the Doctor telling her that she has helped the Doctor in other places in time and space. She enters the time stream to restore the Doctor's timeline. Echoes of Clara fall through space and time and appear in adventures of the Doctor's previous incarnations. The Doctor enters the column of light to save the original Clara, guiding her from a place where she sees several previous incarnations of the Doctor. Reunited, the two spot another figure in the shadows which Clara does not recognise. The Doctor explains the elderly figure is another past incarnation of himself, but what he did in the past was not in the Doctor's name. The figure turns around, revealing himself to be the War Doctor, the incarnation who fought during the great Time War. Continuity Imagery of the Doctor's prior incarnations is used during scenes in which Clara and the Great Intelligence interact with the Doctor. Footage of the First (from The Aztecs, 1964, with dialogue from The Web Planet, 1965), Second, Third (both from The Five Doctors, 1983), Fourth (The Invasion of Time, 1978), Fifth (Arc of Infinity, 1983), and Seventh (Dragonfire, 1987) Doctors was shown. Stunt doubles were used for some other brief appearances, including the Sixth Doctor walking past Clara while she is in a corridor. The Eighth Doctor, the Ninth Doctor and the Tenth Doctor can also be seen running past her in the Doctor's time stream. The opening scene also includes a representation of Susan Foreman and reference to the Doctor's original departure from Gallifrey (as a globed city, previously seen in \\"The Sound of Drums\\", and later seen destroyed in \\"The End of Time\\"). The Great Intelligence says that the Doctor has been \\"bloodsoaked\\" several times, talking about the leader of the Sycorax (whom the Tenth Doctor kills in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\"), Solomon the trader (whom the Eleventh Doctor sends to his death in \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\"), the Daleks, and the Cybermen. The Great Intelligence also states that the Doctor will be known as the Valeyard before the end of his life. The Valeyard appeared in the 1986 serial The Trial of a Time Lord, where he is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnations. John Hurt makes his first ever appearance as the War Doctor at the climax of the episode, foreshadowing the events of \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" and \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", the 50th Anniversary special, in which the events of the Time War and also the Eighth Doctor's regeneration as well as the War Doctor's own is finally explained, bridging the gap between the 1996 Television Movie and the 2005 episode Rose. Production The Whisper Men as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience Lead writer Steven Moffat stated that he wanted to have a new monster in the finale, after the series had seen the reappearance of old monsters such as the Ice Warriors, Cybermen, and Daleks. The idea of the Whisper Men came from \\"the thought of stylish, whispering, almost faceless creatures\\" which seemed frightening and appropriate for \\"an episode that looks forward and back\\". Leak On 12 May 2013, a week before the official premiere of \\"The Name of The Doctor\\", it was announced that 210 Doctor Who fans in the United States had received their Blu-ray box set of the second half of the seventh series early due to a production error. After successfully requesting that they not reveal the plot, the BBC sent the recipients copies of an interview with the cast. Moffat later complimented the \\"210 of them, with the top secret episode in their grasp ‚Äì and because we asked nicely, they didn't breathe a word.\\" Broadcast and reception \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" received overnight ratings of 5.46 million viewers on BBC One. When viewers who watched the episode later on were taken into account, the figure rose to 7.45 million, making Doctor Who the third most-watched programme of the week on BBC One. The episode received an Appreciation Index of 88. The episode received positive reviews. The Guardian described the episode as \\"the best episode of the season\\", and \\"possibly the best finale we've seen\\". Mark Snow of IGN gave the episode 9.1/10, praising the final conversation between the Doctor and River Song, as well as the revelation about Clara; however he noted that the Great Intelligence was \\"a little underwhelming\\" and \\"not very threatening\\", and that while the Whispermen impressed initially, they did not \\"[make] a great villain.\\" Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph said that the episode was \\"even better\\" than the previous two. He noted that it was \\"momentous, moving and thrilling\\". However, he also noted that the episode had \\"a tad too much clunking exposition, the odd spot of creaky CGI and some unconvincing metaphors about souffl√©s and leaves.\\" Despite this, he called it a \\"breathless, brilliant finale\\". Some advance coverage of the story assumed the Doctor's name would actually be revealed in the episode. The episode was nominated for the 2014 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form), along with The Day of the Doctor, An Adventure in Space and Time and The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot. Home media As well as being released on DVD and Blu-ray in a box set alongside the rest of the Series 7 episodes on 28 October 2013, the episode was announced as being a part of a limited edition 50th Anniversary Collection on 23 July 2014. This special DVD and Blu-ray box set was released on 8 September 2014.

It has smooth bark, a crown composed entirely of heart-shaped, sessile juvenile leaves arranged in opposite pairs, single flower buds in leaf axils, red flowers and pendent, hemispherical to conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus rhodantha is a straggly mallee or a shrub, that typically grows up to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth greyish a pinkish bark. The crown is composed entirely of juvenile leaves that are sessile, arranged in opposite paris with their bases surrounding the stem. The leaves are the same shade of dull silver-grey or glaucous on both sides, egg-shaped, long and wide. The flower buds are arranged singly in leaf axils on a down-turned, peduncle long and a pedicel long. Mature buds are egg-shaped, glaucous, long and wide with a beaked operculum long. Flowering occurs from July or September to December or January and the flowers are red, sometimes creamy white. The fruit is a woody, down-turned, hemispherical to conical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus rhodantha was first formally described in 1938 by William Blakely and Henry Steedman in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales from material collected by Steedman near Gunyidi in 1934. The specific epithet (rhodantha) is from ancient Greek, meaning \\"rose coloured\\" and \\"-flowered\\". Distribution and habitat  Eucalyptus rhodantha is only known from a few remnant stands in the northern wheatbelt near Three Springs and Watheroo. Several reports have identified the range extending south to New Norcia and Bolgart. However, these appear to be hybrid progeny of E. macrocarpa and E. pyriformis. Aside from a plant recorded at Eneabba Creek in 1953, the species occurs only at Three Springs and Watheroo. Eneabba Creek and nearby areas were observed in August 1991 but no other populations were found. Since then, the region has been cleared of native vegetation for agriculture. Two moderately undisturbed populations of E. rhodantha occur on uncleared private land in the vicinity of Watheroo. The rest are found on vacant and grazed farmland and degraded road borders. Eucalyptus rhodantha is found in flat or slightly hilly country, on sandy or gravelly soils. Eucalyptus species found in the same area that E. rhodantha populations occur include York gum (E. loxophleba), malallie (E. eudesmioides), mealy gum (E. pleurocarpa) and blackbutt (E. todtiana). The climate of this area has similarities to a Mediterranean climate, with the most rainfall occurring from May to August, but is drier. The summers are hot and the winters cool, and frosts are rare. Average yearly rainfall is 388 mm at Three Springs and 425 mm at Watheroo. Ecology The large flowers can be 7.5 cm (3 in) across, bright red to pink, or occasionally yellow. Shaped like a spinning top, the woody fruits measure 3 cm (1.2 in) long by 5.5 cm (2.2 in) wide, and have winged dark brown seeds. Plants in the vicinity of Three Springs have darker greener leaves. E. rhodantha is related to Eucalyptus macrocarpa, but is a more compact plant with shorter leaves, and smaller hanging buds and fruits. Flowering takes place between March and November, peaking in winter from June to August. Unlike other Eucalyptus species, it produces few flowers per plant. Individual plants differ in the number of flowers, time, and duration of flowering. The long-lived flowers have a lifespan of 20‚Äì30 days, and produce large amounts of nectar during the day. The species is protandrous, the anthers spilling pollen within six or seven days of anthesis. The stigma is not receptive until about twelve days. The flowers are pollinated by a host of birds and small mammals including the white-fronted honeyeater (Phildonyris albifrons) and the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus). New shoots and buds grow over the summer months. Bud weevils (Haplonyx maximus) and Port Lincoln parrots (Barnardius zonarius ssp. zonarius) consume buds, reducing the number that flower. Reproduction E. rhodantha inflorescence E. rhodantha has a mixed mating system; it reproduces mainly by outcrossing but is able to self-pollinate. Protandry doesn‚Äôt stop self-pollination in E. rhodantha, as plants can have numerous flowers in different stages at the same time. Single plants in remote settings have been found with seed, indicating that self-pollination occurs in E. rhodantha. Inbreeding besides self-pollination can also occur, most likely the result of mating between closely related plants. The mixed mating system of E. rhodantha is thought to be the result of outcrossing, which favours heterozynous offspring. Selection pressures throughout the species life cycle appear to favour heterozygosity, which has a significantly higher incidence in mature plants than seeds or seedlings. Conservation The fragmented distribution of E. rhodantha within agricultural regions is a key factor that jeopardises the species long-term survival in the wild. Only two of the extant stands are in uncleared areas, the rest occur on cleared land, or weedy verges. No natural increase in plant numbers, totalling fewer than 1000 mature individuals, has been observed since the populations have been monitored. It is believed that inbreeding has resulted in weaker plants with reduced reproductive capacity. Although unauthorised seed collection from roadside plants has occurred in the past, this practice is now less common. Spray drift resulting from pesticide and herbicide application to nearby crops may have a deleterious effect. Soil borne problems, including salinity and root-rot fungus (Phytophthora cinnamomi), may become an increasing threat in the future. Conservation efforts have involved consultation between local government, state authorities and landowners. In 1995 an area of private land containing the largest discrete population of E. rhodantha var. rhodantha was purchased and is now a nature reserve. Collaborative research involving The University of Western Australia, Curtin University and the Department of Conservation and Land Management has been undertaken to investigate the species' genetic makeup and reproductive biology. Promotion of the widespread cultivation of the species in Australia is also seen to be beneficial to the conservation effort. Eucalyptus rhodantha var. rhodantha is currently listed as Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant) under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 and as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In 2000, E. rhodantha var. petiolaris was determined to be a hybrid of E. rhodantha var. rhodantha and E. pyriformis and therefore not eligible to be listed under the EPBC Act. It is currently categorised by the Department of Environment and Conservation as \\"Priority Four: Rare, Near Threatened and other taxa in need of monitoring\\". Use in horticulture Eucalyptus rhodantha prefers an open position in full sun and is suited to most soils other than those containing lime. Plants may be cultivated in Sydney, despite the significant difference in climatic conditions from their original habitat.

It oversees the budget, planning, delivery and day-to- day operation of the commissioning side of the NHS in England as set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. It directly commissions NHS GPs, dentists and some specialist services. The Secretary of State publishes annually a document known as the mandate which specifies the objectives which the Board should seek to achieve. National Health Service (Mandate Requirements) Regulations are published each year to give legal force to the mandate. NHS England employs around 6,500 staff in 50 sites around England. Most of its staff previously worked for the decommissioned primary care trusts and strategic health authorities. In 2018 it was announced that the organisation, while maintaining its statutory independence, would be merged with NHS Improvement, and seven \\"single integrated regional teams\\" would be jointly established. History Simon Stevens NHS England is the operating name of the NHS Commissioning Board and, before that, the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. It was set up as a special health authority of the NHS in October 2011 as the forerunner to becoming a non-departmental body on 1 April 2013. It was renamed NHS England on 26 March 2013, although its legal name remains the NHS Commissioning Board. Sir David Nicholson, who became Chief Executive at the establishment of the Board, retired at the end of March 2014 and was replaced by Simon Stevens. One of Stevens' first acts was to announce a restructure of the 27 area teams, in response to a requirement to reduce running costs, which would reduce staffing by around 500. The 27 teams outside London were reduced to 12 in 2015. System management NHS England produced a planning document ‚Äì the Five Year Forward View ‚Äì in October 2014 which envisaged development of new models to suit local needs. In conjunction with the other central regulators, the organisation established what is called a \\"success regime\\" in south and mid Essex, North Cumbria and north east and western Devon in June 2015. It was intended to tackle \\"deep rooted and systemic issues that previous interventions have not tackled across [a] whole health and care economy\\". In 2016 it organised the geographical division of England into 44 sustainability and transformation plan areas, with populations between 300,000 and 3 million. These areas were locally agreed between NHS Trusts, local authorities and clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). A leader was appointed for each area, who is to be responsible for the implementation of the plans which are to be agreed by the component organisations. They will be \\"working across organisational boundaries to help build a consensus for transformation and the practical steps to deliver it\\". In April 2017 it introduced a capped expenditure process, applied to NHS commissioners and providers in the 13 areas across England with the largest budget deficits. It is intended to reduce their spending by around ¬£500 million, and health leaders were told to \\"think the unthinkable\\". Funding of clinical commissioning groups NHS England allocates funding (¬£69.5 billion in 2016/2017) to CCGs in accordance with a funding formula. Until 2016, progress towards the amount indicated by the formula from the historical allocation was slow, and CCGs which were above their allocation did not suffer a reduction. From April 2016, however, CCGs with more than 10 per cent above their fair share were to receive \\"flat cash\\" ‚Äì an effective reduction. This would also ensure than no CCG was more than 5 per cent below its target allocation in 2016/2017. Operational pressures escalation levels framework In October 2016 it introduced the Operational Pressures Escalation Levels (OPEL) system for the management of operational difficulties in English hospitals, replacing the system of red and black alerts which was locally defined. OPELs range from 1 (normal) to 4 (a major crisis requiring external intervention either regionally or nationally). This is intended, among other things, to enable comparisons of trends over time and between areas.  Response to 2020 pandemic  In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care directed the NHS Commissioning Board to buy services from the private sector, thereby bypassing CCGs. The Exercise of Commissioning Functions by the NHS Commissioning Board (Coronavirus) Directions 2020 came into force on 20 March 2020, and were revised to widen the definition of independent providers on 27 March. The directive also allows NHS England to exercise functions normally carried out by CCGs, as the Board deems appropriate. The direction will be in place until the end of 2020. Primary care Applications by GPs to reduce their catchment area are dealt with by NHS England. In November 2014, Mr Justice Popplewell declared that NHS England \\"has acted unlawfully by reason of its failure to make arrangements for the involvement of patients in primary care commissioning decisions as required by the National Health Service Act 2006\\". The case involved the decision to scrap the minimum practice income guarantee. Richard Stein, a partner at Leigh Day, said the declaration could mean that patients would have to be involved in discussions on changes to the GP contract. NHS England awarded a four-year contract to Capita to become sole provider of administrative services including payment administration, management of medical records, and eligibility lists for practitioners for GPs, opticians and dentists across the UK in June 2015. Information technology The organisation was reported to be developing a strategy to support the use of personal health records in June 2015. This, it is hoped, could achieve up to ¬£3.4 billion in annual efficiency savings by 2020. In April 2016 it published an index of digital maturity, where each of the 239 NHS trusts assessed its own \\"readiness\\", \\"capabilities\\" and \\"enabling infrastructure\\". In 2018 the NHS app was unveiled, with public backing from Matt Hancock, who presented it as the key to a radical overhaul of NHS technology. The NHS Long Term Plan set a target for all secondary care providers to move to digital records by 2024, which \\"will cover clinical and operational processes across all settings, locations and departments and be based on robust, modern IT infrastructure services for hosting, storage, networks and cyber security.‚Äù Specialised commissioning Specialised services are those provided in relatively few hospitals and accessed by comparatively small numbers of patients, but with catchment populations of usually more than one million. These services tend to be located in specialised hospital trusts that can recruit a team of staff with the appropriate expertise. NHS England is responsible for commissioning ¬£15.6 billion of specialised services and for dealing with Individual Funding Requests in respect of the specialist services it commissions. In 2015 there was criticism of delays in deciding on a policy for the prescription of Everolimus in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis. Twenty doctors addressed a letter to the board in support of the charity Tuberous Sclerosis Association saying \\"around 32 patients with critical need, whose doctors believe everolimus treatment is their best or only option, have no hope of access to funding. Most have been waiting many months. Approximately half of these patients are at imminent risk of a catastrophic event (renal bleed or kidney failure) with a high risk of preventable death.\\" It authorises and pays for treatment of narcolepsy with sodium oxybate by means of individual funding requests on the basis of exceptional circumstances. In May 2016 the High Court ordered NHS England to provide funding to treat a teenager with severe narcolepsy. The judge criticised their ‚Äúthoroughly bad decision‚Äù and ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù policy discriminating against the girl when hundreds of other NHS patients already receive the drug. The Department of Health is also paying for the treatment of people whose narcolepsy was caused by the swine flu vaccine Pandemrix in 2009‚Äì10 by means of private prescriptions outside the National Health Service. Arbitration The organisation's responsibilities include arbitration in disputes between clinical commissioning groups and NHS trusts.

The bombings killed three people and injured approximately 280 others. He and his family had traveled to the United States on a tourist visa and subsequently claimed asylum during their stay in 2002. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012. At the time of the bombings, Tsarnaev was a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Previously, Tsarnaev had attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. Following the bombings, on April 18, MIT Police Officer Sean Collier was shot and killed in a failed attempt by the brothers to steal the officer's gun. There was a shootout between police and the Tsarnaev brothers. Tamerlan was killed and a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police officer was critically injured in the course of Tsarnaev's escape in an SUV. Tsarnaev was injured but escaped, and a manhunt ensued, with thousands of police searching a 20-block area of Watertown, Massachusetts. On the evening of April 19, the seriously wounded Tsarnaev was found unarmed hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown just outside the police perimeter. After the police opened fire at the boat, they arrested him, and took him to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Tsarnaev was charged on April 22 with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death. Tsarnaev later said during questioning that they next intended to detonate explosives in Times Square in New York City. Tsarnaev reportedly also said to authorities that he and his brother were radicalized, at least in part, by watching lectures by Anwar al-Awlaki. He was convicted on April 8, 2015, and sentenced to death on June 24, 2015. His death sentence was vacated on appeal in July 2020, though convictions on other charges remain in place, and he remains in prison on several life sentences. Personal background Family background The Tsarnaev family was forcibly moved from Chechnya to the Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan in the years following World War II. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's father, Anzor Tsarnaev, is a Chechen, and his mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, is an Avar. The couple had two sons, Tamerlan, born in the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1986, and Dzhokhar, born in Kyrgyzstan in 1993. The parents also have two daughters, Bella and Aliana. Anzor is a traditional Muslim who shuns extremism and raised his children as Muslims. According to some, other Chechen Americans in the area apparently did not consider the American branch of the family to be \\"fully\\" Chechen because they had never lived in Chechnya. As children, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar lived in Tokmok, Kyrgyzstan. In 2001, the family moved to Makhachkala, Dagestan, in the Russian Federation. In April 2002, the Tsarnaev parents and Dzhokhar went to the United States on a 90-day tourist visa. Anzor Tsarnaev applied for asylum, citing fears of deadly persecution due to his ties to Chechnya. Tamerlan was left in the care of his uncle Ruslan in Kyrgyzstan and arrived in the U.S. about two years later. In the U.S. the parents received asylum and then filed for their four children, who received \\"derivative asylum status\\". They settled on Norfolk Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tamerlan lived there until his death. The family \\"was in constant transition\\" for the next decade. Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva both received welfare benefits. The father worked as a backyard mechanic and the mother worked as a cosmetologist until she lost her job for refusing to work in a business that served men. In March 2007, the family was granted legal permanent residence. Early life Tsarnaev was born in Kyrgyzstan on July 22, 1993. As a child, he emigrated with his family to Russia and then, when he was eight years old, to the United States under political asylum. The family settled in Cambridge and became U.S. permanent residents in March 2007. Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012, while in college. His mother, Zubeidat, also became a U.S. citizen, but it is not clear if his father, Anzor, ever did. Tamerlan, his brother, was unable to naturalize expeditiously due to an investigation against him, which held up the citizenship process. Dzhokhar attended Cambridgeport Elementary School and Cambridge Community Charter School's middle school program. At Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, a public high school, he was an avid wrestler and a Greater Boston League winter all-star. He sometimes worked as a lifeguard at Harvard University.Jared Lucky, \\"Months Before Marathon Bombing, Suspect Worked as Harvard Lifeguard\\", Harvard Crimson (April 19, 2013). In 2011, he contacted a professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who taught a class about Chechen history, expressing his interest in the topic. He graduated from high school in 2011 and the city of Cambridge awarded him a $2,500 scholarship that year. His brother's boxing coach, who had not seen them in a few years at the time of the bombings, said that \\"the young brother was like a puppy dog, following his older brother\\". Life as a university student Tsarnaev enrolled at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in September 2011. He started with a marine biology major with the intent on becoming a dentist but later changed to nursing. Tsarnaev was described as \\"normal\\" and popular among fellow students. His friends said he sometimes smoked marijuana,Matt Stout and Donna Goodison.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev loves pot, wrestling say friends\\", Boston Herald, April 20, 2013. liked hip hop, and did not talk to them about politics.Barney Henderson, \\"Boston Marathon bombs: suspect captured ‚Äì April 20 as it happened\\" Many friends and other acquaintances found it inconceivable that he could be one of the two bombers at first, calling it \\"completely out of his character\\". He was not perceived as foreign, spoke English without a [foreign] accent, was sociable, and was described by peers as \\"[not] 'them'. He was 'us'. He was Cambridge.\\" On the Russian-language social-networking site VK, Tsarnaev described his \\"world view\\" as \\"Islam\\" and his personal priorities as \\"career and money\\". He posted links to Islamic websites, links to videos of fighters in the Syrian civil war, and links to pages advocating independence for Chechnya. Dzhokhar was also active on Twitter. According to The Economist, he seemed \\"to have been much more concerned with sport and cheeseburgers than with religion, at least judging by his Twitter feed\\"; however, according to The Boston Globe, on the day of the 2012 Boston Marathon, a year before the bombings, a post on Tsarnaev's Twitter feed mentioned a Quran verse often used by radical Muslim clerics and propagandists. In 2012, Arlington Police ran a warrant check on Tsarnaev and checked his green Honda when they were investigating a report of underage drinking at a party in Arlington Heights. At the time of the bombing, Tsarnaev was a sophomore living in the UMass Dartmouth's Pine Dale Hall dorm. He was struggling academically, having a 1.09 GPA and receiving seven failing grades over three semesters, including Fs in Principles of Modern Chemistry, Introduction to American Politics, and Chemistry and the Environment and had an unpaid bill of $20,000 to the university. He was known to be selling marijuana to make money. 2011 Waltham triple murder A triple homicide was committed in Waltham, Massachusetts, on the evening of September 11, 2011. After the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the case was re-examined, and authorities said the Tsarnaev brothers may have been responsible for the murders, that forensic evidence connected them to the scene of the killings, and that their cell phone records placed them in the area at the time of the killings. In May 2013, Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old Chechen native and former mixed martial arts fighter who knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was shot and killed in Orlando, Florida, by law enforcement officers who had been interviewing him about the bombings and the Waltham murders. The FBI alleged that just before he was killed, Todashev made statements implicating both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the Waltham murders‚Äîsaying that the initial crime was a drug-related robbery, and the murders were committed to prevent being identified by the victims. 2013 Boston Marathon bombing Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted of participating, along with his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in the 2013 Boston Bombing. He reportedly \\"told the FBI that [he and his brother] were angry about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there.\\" That day, Dzhokhar was captured on CCTV near the finish line pushing his way through spectators towards the front carrying a duffel bag which contained one of two pressure cooker bombs that would detonate. Tsarnaev appeared to place the bag down without causing any suspicion amongst spectators and then appeared to watch some marathon runners cross the finish line before hurrying away moments before the bomb exploded, causing mass panic among spectators and marathon runners. Shortly after the second bomb exploded, CCTV captured both Tsarnaev brothers running among the crowd away from the scene. Tsarnaev continued to tweet after the bombings, and sent a tweet telling the people of Boston to \\"stay safe\\". He returned to his university after the April 15 bombing and remained there until April 18, when the FBI released pictures of him and Tamerlan at the marathon.

MIT killing, carjacking, firefight, and manhunt Tsarnaev and his brother murdered MIT police officer Sean Collier on April 18, 2013 at the MIT campus in an attempt to steal his gun, before traveling to the Boston neighborhood of Allston. There, the brothers carjacked an SUV and robbed the owner.\\"On Allston block where carjacking took place, neighbors say they saw nothing\\"' Boston.com. April 26, 2013. Retrieved April 29, 2013. However, the owner of the car said he managed to escape when the Tsarnaevs became momentarily distracted in the process of refueling the car at a cash-only gas station. Dun Meng, who originally did not give his name to the media but said he goes by the name \\"Danny\\", said he fled to another nearby gas station and contacted the police. Police were then able to track the location of the car through the man's cellphone and the SUV's anti-theft tracking device. When police found the stolen SUV and a Honda being driven by the brothers in the early hours of April 19, the suspects engaged in a shootout with police in Watertown. During the gunfight, in which bombs were thrown at responding officers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was wounded while Tamerlan was shot a number of times before being apprehended. Police say that Dzhokhar escaped by driving the stolen SUV toward the officers who were arresting his brother. Although the officers managed to avoid being hit, Tsarnaev drove over Tamerlan, dragging him under the SUV about in the process (Tamerlan would later die at a nearby hospital). Tsarnaev reportedly sped off, but abandoned the car about away and then fled on foot. An unprecedented manhunt ensued involving thousands of police officers from several nearby towns as well as state police and FBI, and SWAT teams, who searched numerous homes and property inside a 10-block perimeter. Warrants were not issued, but residents reported they were told they must allow the searches to go forward. Many reported being instructed to leave their homes as well. Images of squad cars and large black armored vehicles crowding the side streets, and videos of residents being led out of their homes at gunpoint soon flooded social media. The Boston metro area was effectively shut down all day on April 19. After Tsarnaev's name was published in connection with the bombings, his uncle Ruslan Tsarni, who lives in Montgomery Village, Maryland, pleaded with Tsarnaev through television to turn himself in \\"and ask for forgiveness\\", and said that he had shamed the family and the Chechen ethnicity. Arrest and detention During the manhunt for him on the evening of April 19, Tsarnaev was discovered wounded in a boat in a Watertown backyard, less than from where he abandoned the SUV. David Henneberry, the owner of the boat, had noticed that the cover on the boat was loose and when the \\"shelter in place\\" order was lifted, went outside to investigate. He lifted the tarpaulin, saw a bloodied man, retreated into his house and called 9-1-1. Three Boston police officers responded and were soon joined by Waltham police. Tsarnaev's presence and movement were later verified through a forward looking infrared thermal imaging device in a State Police helicopter. The suspect was observed pushing up at the tarp on the boat and Boston police began directing a large volume of gunfire at the suspect, stopping only after calls from the superintendent on the scene. After initial reports of a shootout between police and Tsarnaev, two U.S. officials said on April 24 that Dzhokhar was unarmed when captured. Tsarnaev, who had been shot and was bleeding badly from wounds to his left ear, neck and thigh, was taken into federal custody after the standoff. Initial reports that the neck wound was from a self-inflicted gunshot due to a possible suicide attempt were later contradicted by the revelation that he was unarmed at the time of capture and a description of the neck wound by SWAT team members that it was a slicing injury, possibly caused by shrapnel from an explosion. In an image broadcast on the night of his arrest, he was shown stepping out of the boat in which he had been hiding. Other sources described him \\"lying on his stomach, straddling the side of the boat (‚Ä¶) His left arm and left leg hung over the boat's side. He appeared to struggle for consciousness.\\" Then he was \\"hauled down to the grassy ground\\" by a SWAT officer. In a photograph he can be seen lying on the ground on his back with his hands cuffed behind him, being helped by medical staff. He was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, where he was treated for severe injuries in the intensive-care unit. He was in serious but stable condition (updated to \\"fair\\" on April 23), and unable to speak because of the wound to his throat. According to one of the nurses, he had cried for two days straight after waking up. He responded to authorities in writing and by nodding his head, although he did manage to say the word \\"no\\" when asked if he could afford a lawyer. Court documents released in August 2013, show that Tsarnaev had a skull fracture and gunshot wounds prior to being taken into custody. According to a doctor that treated him, Tsarnaev had a skull-base fracture, with injuries to the middle ear, the skull base, the lateral portion of his C1 vertebra, with a significant soft tissue injury, as well as injury to the pharynx, the mouth, and a small vascular injury. Tsarnaev had written a message on the inside of the boat, reportedly saying \\"The [Boston] bombings were in retribution for the U.S. crimes in places like Iraq and Afghanistan [and] that the victims of the Boston bombing were collateral damage, in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world.\\" On April 26, Tsarnaev was transported by U.S. Marshals to the Federal Medical Center, Devens,Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator: Dzhokhar Anzorovi Tsarnaev, #95079-038.

Rolling Stone magazine Image of Tsarnaev on the cover of Rolling Stone Tsarnaev was the subject of a cover story for an August 2013 issue of Rolling Stone entitled \\"The Bomber: How a Popular, Promising Student Was Failed by His Family, Fell into Radical Islam and Became a Monster.\\" The magazine drew heavy criticism for the flattering photo of Tsarnaev on the issue's cover. Boston Mayor Tom Menino wrote that the cover \\"rewards a terrorist with celebrity treatment.\\" Massachusetts State Police sergeant Sean Murphy said that \\"glamorizing the face of terror is not just insulting to the family members of those killed in the line of duty, it also could be an incentive to those who may be unstable to do something to get their face on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine\\". The New York Times used the same photo on their front page in May 2013, but did not draw criticism. Rolling Stone columnist Matt Taibbi criticized those who took offense at the cover, arguing that they associated Rolling Stone with glamour instead of news, stating that The New York Times did not draw the criticism that Rolling Stone did, \\"because everyone knows the Times is a news organization. Not everyone knows that about Rolling Stone‚Ä¶ because many people out there understandably do not know that Rolling Stone is also a hard-news publication.\\" The editors of Rolling Stone posted the following response: :Our hearts go out to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, and our thoughts are always with them and their families. The cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stones long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day. The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in the same age group as many of our readers, makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens. ‚ÄìTHE EDITORSJahar's World Rolling Stone Retailers such as CVS Pharmacy, BJ's Wholesale Club (which additionally announced it would no longer carry Rolling Stone) and others, announced that they would no longer sell the issue. Adweek magazine ranked the cover the \\"hottest\\" of the year after it doubled newsstand sales to 120,000. The cover photo was taken by Tsarnaev himself, not a professional photographer. Legal proceedings Questioning, charges and confessions Initially, Tsarnaev was questioned without being read his Miranda rights, because the Justice Department invoked Miranda's public safety exception. He was to be questioned by a federal High- Value Interrogation Group, a special counterterrorism group created to question high-value detainees, which included members of the FBI, CIA, and Department of Defense. Later, after being read his Miranda rights, Tsarnaev stopped talking and declined to continue to cooperate with the investigation. Prosecutors initially argued for the public safety exception to be appliedhttps://cdn0.vox- cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2902472/tsarnaev1.0.pdf to the statements obtained before the Miranda rights were read. However, the exception was not considered by the court because the prosecutors later decided not to use any of that evidence in their case against Tsarnaev.https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS- mad-1_13-cr-10200/pdf/USCOURTS-mad-1_13-cr-10200-6.pdf On April 22, he was charged with \\"using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death\\" and with \\"malicious destruction of properties resulting in death\\", both in connection with the Boston Marathon attacks.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev charged with conspiring to use weapon of mass destruction against persons and property in U.S. resulting in death ‚Äì U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts official Twitter He was read his Miranda rights at his bedside by a federal magistrate judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, nodded his head to answer the judge's questions, and answered \\"no\\" when asked whether he could afford a lawyer. Once convicted, he was eligible to face the death penalty. He was prosecuted by assistant U.S. attorneys William Weinreb and Aloke Chakravarty, of the Anti- Terrorism and National Security Unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston. His defense team included federal public defender Miriam Conrad, William Fick, and Judy Clarke. Middlesex County prosecutors also brought criminal charges against Tsarnaev for the murder of Sean Collier. A surveillance camera at MIT captured the brothers approaching Collier's car from behind. Officials said, after initial interrogations, that it was clear the attack was religiously motivated, but that so far there was no evidence that the brothers had any ties to Islamic terror organizations. Officials also said that Dzhokhar acknowledged his role in the bombings and told interrogators that he and Tamerlan were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs and the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to carry out the bombing. Dzhokhar admitted during questioning that he and his brother were planning to detonate explosives in New York City's Times Square next. The brothers formed the plan spontaneously during the April 18 carjacking, but things went awry after the vehicle ran low on gas and they forced the driver to stop at a gas station, where he escaped. Dzhokhar says he was inspired by online videos from Anwar al-Awlaki,\\"Boston Suspects Inspired by Muslim Cleric\\", May 4, 2013 who also inspired Faisal Shahzad, the perpetrator of the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt. Investigators have so far found no evidence that Tsarnaev was involved in any jihadist activities, and, according to The Wall Street Journal, now believe that unlike his brother Tamerlan, Dzhokhar \\"was never truly radicalized\\".Suspect Raised No Red Flags, Wall Street Journal, May 15, 2013 Examinations of his computers did not reveal frequent visits to jihad websites, expressions of violent Islamist rhetoric or other suspicious activities. Some law enforcement officials told the WSJ that Tsarnaev \\"better fit[s] the psychological profile of an ordinary criminal than a committed terrorist\\". On May 16, 2013, during CBS This Morning, CBS News senior correspondent John Miller said he had been told that Tsarnaev wrote a note in the boat in which he was hiding and claimed responsibility for the April 15 attack during the marathon. The note was scribbled with a pen on one of the inside walls of the cabin and said the bombings were payback for the U.S. military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and referred to the Boston victims as collateral damage, the same way Muslims have been in the American-led wars. He continued, \\"When you attack one Muslim, you attack all Muslims.\\" He also said he did not mourn his brother's death because now Tamerlan was a martyr in paradise and that he (Dzhokhar) expected to join him in paradise. Miller's sources said the wall the note was written on had multiple bullet holes in it from the shots that were fired into the boat by police. According to Miller during the interview he gave on the morning show, he said that the note will be a significant piece of evidence in any Dzhokhar trial and that it is \\"certainly admissible\\", and paints a clear picture of the brothers' motive, \\"consistent with what he told investigators while he was in custody\\". Trial ADX Florence, the prison housing Tsarnaev =Charges, pleas= Tsarnaev's arraignment for 30 charges, including four counts of murder, occurred on July 10, 2013, in federal court in Boston before U.S. magistrate judge Marianne Bowler. It was his first public court appearance. He pleaded not guilty to all 30 counts against him, which included using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death. Tsarnaev was represented by Miriam Conrad, David Bruck, William Fick, Timothy G. Watkins and Judy Clarke.http://images.politico.com/global/2013/04/29/tsarnaevclarkeord.html On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. A plea deal failed when the government refused to rule out the possibility of the death penalty. The trial began on January 5, 2015; Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all thirty charges laid against him. The proceedings were led by Judge George O'Toole. Tsarnaev's attorney Judy Clarke admitted in her opening statement that Tsarnaev committed the acts in question, but sought to avert the death penalty by showing that his brother Tamerlan was the mastermind behind the acts.https://jimmysllama.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/boston-trial- transcript-day-1-27-defense.pdf U.S. vs Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, court transcripts Counter-terrorism expert Matthew Levitt also gave testimony. =Verdict= On April 8, 2015, Tsarnaev was found guilty on all thirty counts of the indictment. The charges of usage of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, in addition to aiding and abetting, made Tsarnaev eligible for the death penalty. Bill and Denise Richard, parents of Martin Richard (the youngest of the three killed in the bombings and 1 of the 2 people killed by Dzhokhar's bomb, the other person being Chinese-exchange student Lingzi Lu), urged against a death sentence for Tsarnaev. They stated that the lengthy appeals period would force them to continually relive that day, and would rather see Tsarnaev spend life in prison without parole (possibility of release), and waive his right to appeal. Tsarnaev, who had displayed little emotion throughout his trial, appeared to weep when his relatives testified on May 4, 2015. On May 15, 2015, the jury recommended that Tsarnaev be sentenced to death by lethal injection on six of 17 capital counts. According to the verdict forms completed by the jurors, three of 12 believed that Tsarnaev had taken part in the attack under his brother's influence; two believed that he had been remorseful for his actions;Seelye, Katharine Q. \\"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Gets Death Penalty in Boston Marathon Bombing\\". The New York Times. The New York Times, May 15, 2015. Web. May 18, 2015. two believed that Tamerlan, not Dzhokhar, had shot and killed Officer Collier; three believed that his friends still care about him; one believed that Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, was to be blamed for the brothers' actions; one believed that Tsarnaev would never be violent again in prison. Massachusetts ended the death penalty for state crimes in 1984. However, because Tsarnaev was tried on federal charges, he was eligible for execution.\\"Boston Bombing Trial: Death Sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\\". BBC News. N.p., May 16, 2015. Web. May 18, 2015. =Death sentence= On June 24, 2015, Tsarnaev faced his victims in court as his death sentence was formally delivered. Victims and their families were able to present impact statements to the court, and Tsarnaev, who had been silent throughout his month-long trial, apologized to the injured and the bereaved in the bombings. =On death row= The following morning, on June 25, 2015, Tsarnaev was transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Florence High in Colorado; as of July 17, 2015 he had been transferred to ADX Florence.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev transferred to Supermax prison, Milton J. Valencia, Boston Globe, July 17, 2015. Accessed on line July 20, 2015. A Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) spokesperson stated that \\"unique security management requirements\\" caused the agency to place Tsarnaev in Colorado instead of United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana, where male death-row inmates are normally held. =Al-Qaeda reaction= According to The Guardian, in June 2016, Al- Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri issued a threat to the United States of the \\"gravest consequences\\" if Tsarnaev should be harmed.Al-Qaida leader: 'grave consequences' for US if Boston bomber executed, Anan Yuhas, July 1, 2016 (The Guardian website) = Appeal = Tsarnaev appealed his sentence on the grounds that the trial should not have been held in Boston; that there were errors in jury selection; and that the judge improperly excluded evidence that Tamerlan Tsarnaev and another man, Ibragim Toadashev committed a prior triple murder in Waltham on September 11, 2011, suggesting that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev acted under his influence, and was possibly fearful of what would happen to him if he refused. The appeal was heard by a three-judge panel of the First Circuit on December 12, 2019. On July 31, 2020, the First Circuit overturned the death sentence and three of the other convictions, agreeing that the judge failed to determine how much the potential jurors had been aware of the event during jury selection, and ordered a retrial with a new jury for the penalty phase of his trial. Tsarnaev remained in prison from multiple life sentences carried by the other uncontested convictions. U.S. Circuit Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson, who wrote the opinion clarified the ruling of the court. She stated, \\"Make no mistake: Dzhokhar will spend his remaining days locked up in prison, with the only matter remaining being whether he will die by execution.\\" The Department of Justice is currently appealing the decision to the US Supreme Court.

A distinction was made between the gift (which was only valid for the lifetime of the liegeman) and the inheritable fee. The economic circumstances of the Lehnsleute varied greatly, but as the territorial states developed in the late Middle Ages, their fighting duties were supplanted by the creation of mercenary armies and their role in governing estates was increasingly taken over by trained, non- aristocratic administrators. The life of a Lehnsmann in the early 16th century was described by Ulrich von Hutten (1488‚Äì1523) in a letter to Willibald Pirckheimer (1470‚Äì1530): :\\"The people from whom we earn our livelihood, are very poor farmers, to whom we lease our lands, vineyards, meadows and fields. The return from them is very low for the amount of effort involved, but the farmers look after them and toil away to produce as large a return as possible, because we have to be extremely prudent economically. We also serve a prince, from whom we hope for protection; I do not provide that, so everyone thinks he can get away with anything and everything against me. In addition, for the prince's liegeman, this hope [of protection] is combined every day with danger and fear. For if I put just one foot out of the house, there is the risk that I will come across people with whom the prince has had disputes and feuds, and that they will attack me and take me away as a prisoner. If I am unlucky, I could lose half my possessions to pay the ransom and so the protection I am supposed to enjoy would turn out to be quite the opposite.\\"Von Hutten, Ulrich (1518). Extract of letter to Willibald Pirckheimer, dated 25 October 1518, Marburg Digital Archive: no. 1275. :\\"We therefore keep horses and buy ourselves weapons, and surround ourselves with a large retinue, all of which costs a great deal of money. We cannot leave even two acres of land unguarded for very long, we must not visit a farm without being armed, and, when hunting and fishing, we have to wear armour. The quarrels between foreign farmers and our own never cease, no day goes by without reports of quarreling and strife, that we try to settle with the utmost care.\\" :\\"For if I defend myself or pursue wrongs too vigorously, there are feuds. But if I am a little too patient or even give up what is due to me, I am encouraging unjust attacks against me from all sides, because whatever I abandon to one person, is immediately seized upon by all as a reward for their injustice.\\" :\\"No matter whether a castle stands on a hill or on the plains, it is definitely not built for comfort, but for defence, surrounded by moats and ramparts, inside oppressively small, packed with livestock and stables, its dark chambers crammed with heavy rifles, pitch, sulphur and all other kinds of weapons and warlike equipment. Everywhere, there is the whiff of gunpowder; and the smell of dogs and their muck is not sweet, I think.\\" :Horsemen come and go, including robbers, thieves and highwaymen, because our houses are usually open to all sorts of people, and we do not know the individual particularly well or do not especially look after him. And what a noise! Sheep bleating, oxen bellowing, dogs barking, workers in the field shouting, wagons and carts creaking, and, at home, we can even hear the wolves howling. Every day you worry about the next, you're always on the go, always anxious. Von Hutten not only gives descriptions of the feudal system, but also numerous criticisms of medieval nobility, clergy, and academics. Eventually, some elements of the dissatisfied knighthood rose up in arms under Franz von Sickingen (1481-1523) and Ulrich von Hutten in the so-called Knights' Revolt (1522-1523). It was quickly suppressed. Both von Hutten and von Sickingen supported the reforming priest and theologian, Martin Luther. Sickingen was mortally wounded, fighting against the Archbishopric of Trier. Von Hutten died a year later in Switzerland. The Imperial Knights council (Reichsritterstand) eventually lost its political importance. But the feudal system was not officially abolished until 1848. Von Hutten and von Sickingen are both honoured with busts in the Valhalla memorial at Donaustauf.

The learner uses generalized patterns, principles, and other similarities between past experiences and novel experiences to more efficiently navigate the world.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. For example, if a person has learned in the past that every time they eat an apple, their throat becomes itchy and swollen, they might assume they are allergic to all fruit. When this person is offered a banana to eat, they reject it upon assuming they are also allergic to it through generalizing that all fruits cause the same reaction. Although this generalization about being allergic to all fruit based on experiences with one fruit could be correct in some cases, it may not be correct in all. Both positive and negative effects have been shown in education through learned generalization and its contrasting notion of discrimination learning.  Overview  Generalization is understood to be directly tied to the transfer of knowledge across multiple situations. The knowledge to be transferred is often referred to as abstractions, because the learner abstracts a rule or pattern of characteristics from previous experiences with similar stimuli.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. Generalization allows humans and animals to recognize the similarities in knowledge acquired in one circumstance, allowing for transfer of knowledge onto new situations. This idea rivals the theory of situated cognition, instead stating that one can apply past knowledge to learning in new situations and environments. Generalization can be supported and partly explained by the connectionism approach.Goldstein, B. E. (2015). Cognitive psychology: connecting mind research and everyday experience. W. Ross MacDonald School Resource Services Library. Just as artificial intelligences learn to distinguish between different categories by applying past learning to novel situations, humans and animals generalize previously learned properties and patterns onto new situations, thus connecting the novel experience to past experiences that are similar in one or more ways. This creates a pattern of connections that allows the learner to classify and make assumptions about the novel stimulus, such as when previous experience with seeing a canary allows the learner to predict what other birds will be like. This categorization is a foundational aspect of generalizing.  Research on generalization  In scientific studies looking at generalization, a generalization gradient is often used. This tool is used to measure how often and how much animals or humans respond to certain stimuli, depending on whether the stimuli are perceived to be similar or different. The curvilinear shape of the gradient is achieved by placing the perceived similarity of a stimulus on the x-axis and the strength of the response on the y-axis.Boddez, Y., Bennett, M. P., van Esch, S., & Beckers, T. (2017). Bending rules: the shape of the perceptual generalisation gradient is sensitive to inference rules. Cognition & Emotion, 31(7), 1444‚Äì1452. https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2016.1230541 For example, when measuring responses to color, it is expected that subjects will respond to colors that are similar to each other, like shades of pink after being exposed to red, as opposed to a non-similar shade of blue. The gradient is relatively predictable, with the response to similar stimuli being slightly less strong than the response to the conditioned stimulus, then steadily declining as the presented stimuli become increasingly dissimilar.The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica. (2019, September 30). Generalization. Retrieved from https://www.britannica.com/topic/generalization Several studies have suggested that generalization is a fundamental and naturally-occurring learning process for humans. Nine-month-old infants require very few (sometimes only 3) experiences with a category before learning to generalize.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. In fact, infants generalize so well during early stages of development (such as learning to recognize specific sounds as language) that it can be hard for them to discriminate between variations of the generalized stimuli at later stages of development (such as failing to distinguish between the subtly different sounds of similar phonemes).Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. One potential explanation for why children are such efficient learners is that they operate in accordance with the goal of making their world more predictable, therefore encouraging them to hold strongly to generalizations that effectively help them to navigate their environment.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. Some evidence suggests that children are born with innate processes for accurately generalizing things. For example, children tend to generalize based on taxonomic rather than thematic similarities (an experience with one ball leads to the child identifying other ball-shaped objects as ‚Äúball‚Äù rather than labeling a bat as ‚Äúball‚Äù because a bat is used to hit a ball).Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. Wakefield, Hall, James, and Goldin (2018) found that children are more flexible in generalizing new verbs when they are taught the verb by observing gestures as opposed to being taught by performing the action themselves.Wakefield, E. M., Hall, C., James, K. H., & Goldin, M. S. (2018). Gesture for generalization: gesture facilitates flexible learning of words for actions on objects. Developmental Science, 21(5), 1. https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12656 When helping a child learn a new word, providing more examples of the word increases the child‚Äôs capacity to generalize the word to different contexts and situations. Furthermore, writing interventions for grade-school students yield better results when the intervention actively targets generalization as an outcome.Hier, B. O., Eckert, T. L., Viney, E. A., & Meisinger, E. (2019). Generalization and maintenance effects of writing fluency intervention strategies for elementary-age students: A randomized controlled trial. School Psychology Review, 48(4), 377. https://doi.org/10.17105/SPR-2017-0123.V48-4 Generalization has been shown to be refined and/or stabilized after sleep.  Implications  Without the ability to generalize, it would likely be very difficult to navigate the world in a useful way.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. For example, generalization is an important part of how humans learn to trust unfamiliar peopleFeldmanHall, O., Dunsmoor, J. E., Tompary, A., Hunter, L. E., Todorov, A., & Phelps, E. A. (2018). Stimulus generalization as a mechanism for learning to trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115(7). doi: 10.1073/pnas.1715227115 and a necessary element in language acquisition.Arnon, I., & Clark, E. V. (Eds.). (2011). Experience, variation and generalization: Learning a first language. Retrieved from https://ebookcentral.proquest.com For a person who lacked the capacity to generalize from one experience to the next, every instance of a dog would be completely separated from other instances of dogs, so prior experience would do nothing to help the person know how to interact with this seemingly new stimulus.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. In fact, even if the person experienced the very same dog multiple times, he or she would have no way of knowing what to expect and each instance would be as if the individual were encountering a dog for the first time. Therefore, generalization is a valuable and integral part of learning and everyday life. Generalization is shown to have implications on the use of the spacing effect in educational settings. In the past, it was thought that the information forgotten between periods of learning when implementing spaced presentation inhibited generalization. In more recent years, this forgetting has been seen as promoting generalization through repetition of information during each occasion of spaced learning. The effects of gaining long-term generalization knowledge through spaced learning can be compared with that of massed learning (lengthy and all at once; for example, cramming the night before an exam) in which a person only gains short-term knowledge, decreasing the likelihood of establishing generalization. Generalization is also considered to be an important factor in procedural memory, such as the near-automatic memory processes necessary for driving a car.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. Without being able to generalize from previous experiences driving, a person would essentially need to relearn how to drive every time he or she encountered a new street. Not all of generalization‚Äôs effects are beneficial, however. An important part of learning is knowing when not to generalize, which is called discrimination learning. Were it not for discrimination learning, humans and animals would struggle to respond correctly to different situations.Cherry, K. (2019, November 26). How stimulus generalization influences learning. Retrieved from https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-stimulus-generalization-2795885 For example, a dog may be trained to come to its owner when it hears a whistle. If the dog generalizes this training, it may not discriminate between the sound of the whistle and other stimuli, so it would come running to its owner when it hears any high-pitched noise.  Fear generalization  A specific type of generalization, fear generalization, occurs when a person associates fears learned in the past through classical conditioning to similar situations, events, people, and objects in their present. This is important for the survival of the organism; humans and animals need to be able to assess aversive situations and respond appropriately based on generalizations made from past experiences.Asok, A., Kandel, E. R., & Rayman, J. B. (2019). The neurobiology of fear generalization. Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, 12. doi: 10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00329 When fear generalization becomes maladaptive it is connected to many anxiety disorders. This maladaptation is often referred to as the overgeneralization of fear and can also lead to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. Overgeneralization is hypothetically attributed to ‚Äúdysregulation of prefrontal-amygdalo-hippocampal circuitry‚Äù (Banich, et al. , 2010, p. 21).Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. One of the earliest studies about fear generalization in humans was conducted by Watson and Raynor (1920): the Little Albert experiment. In their study, an infant known as Little Albert was exposed to various kinds of animals, none of which elicited a fear response from Little Albert. However, after 7 pairings of a white rat and the sound of a hammer clanging against a steel bar (which did elicit a fear response), the 11-month old child began to cry and try to get away from the white rat even without the loud noise. Months later, additional trials showed that Little Albert had generalized his fear response to things that were similar to the white rat, including a dog, a rabbit, and a fur coat.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. Brain regions involved in fear generalization include the amygdala and the hippocampus.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press. The hippocampus seems to be more involved in the development of context fear generalization (developing a generalized fear for a specific environment) than stimulus fear generalization (such as Little Albert‚Äôs acquisition of a fear response to white, furry objects). The amygdala, which is associated with all types of emotional responses, is fundamental in developing a classically conditioned fear response to either a stimulus or the context in which it is found.Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.

Family background  Carl von Effner was descended from the Effner family, who for many years were gardeners in the service of the Bavarian royal court. He was great-grandson of the distinguished architect and builder Joseph Effner (1687-1745)  Life  Monument of Carl von Effner in the Maximiliansplatz in Munich (by Wilhelm von R√ºmann) He was born as Carl Effner in Munich, son of Carl Effner (the elder) (1791-1870), Senior Bavarian Court Gardener. After a gardening apprenticeship he made various study visits to Vienna, Paris, England and Sanssouci, where he also became familiar with the \\"mixed style\\" of garden designi.e., mixed between the formal French style and the informal English style of the well-known Prussian landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenn√© involving the formation of regular areas of formal ornamental garden within wider areas of landscaped garden, which enjoyed a revival in the mid-19th century. On these study trips he was accompanied by Max Kolb, the later Inspector of the Botanical Gardens, Nymphenburg. In 1857 Maximilian II recalled him to Munich and at the early age of 26 appointed him Court Gardener. From 1860 to 1865 he was active as representative of the Senior Court Gardener on the staff of the Obersthofmarschall. Maximilian made Effner responsible for the landscaping of the banks of the Isar between Haidhausen and Bogenhausen (later known as the Maximiliansanlagen, or Maximilian Gardens) and for the garden element of the Maximilianstrasse designed by Friedrich B√ºrklein. In 1868 Effner was appointed Head Court Gardener, and director of all Bavarian court gardens, by the Bavarian Regent Ludwig II. In 1870 Ludwig II, by that time king, made Effner Royal Inspector of Court Gardens and in 1873 Royal Director of Court Gardens. He now designed the gardens for Ludwig II's castles, Neues Schloss, Herrenchiemsee, and Linderhof. He also designed numerous private gardens in Bavaria. He sometimes worked on the earlier gardens with his father. In 1877 he was raised to the nobility (as von Effner). He died in Munich on 22 October 1884 and is buried in the Alter S√ºdfriedhof (grave 13-1-34).

At present, more than 400 people are working for Loesche in Germany and around 850 are employed worldwide. In addition to its new subsidiary in Indonesia, Loesche has operations in Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, Nigeria, Spain, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States, and it's represented by agents in more than 30 countries. Company history Ernst Curt Loesche - Founder of Loesche GmbH In 1906, the engineer Curt von Grueber established a company for the design and sale of Kent mills in Berlin. Curt von Grueber Technisches Bureau ‚Äì the forerunner of Loesche GmbH ‚Äìwas a manufacturer of cement and phosphate mills. In 1912, the company began manufacturing its products in its own manufacturing facility, initially in Berlin-Hohensch√∂nhausen and later in Berlin-Teltow. Its range of products included Maxecon mills, Hauenschild rotary grate kilns, and all kinds of machinery for cement production, including crushers and screw conveyors. In July 1912 Ernst Curt Loesche joined the company as a young engineer. He soon worked his way up through the ranks to a management position and became a partner in the company in 1919. Despite the fact that the German cement industry found itself in a deep and sustained crisis after the First World War, Curt von Grueber Technisches Bureau managed to stay afloat by supplying new coal-fired power stations with mills. In 1927, Ernst Curt Loesche developed the Loesche mill for the Klingenberg power station in Berlin-Rummelsburg and in 1937, Ernst Curt Loesche bought Curt von Grueber‚Äôs share in the company and became sole owner. The outbreak of the Second World War was a caesura in the history of Ernst Curt Loesche‚Äôs company. As was the case with many other machine manufacturers, the company was obliged to produce armaments for the German war effort: the Reich Air Ministry soon replaced the cement industry as the company‚Äôs largest customer. Following a damaging air raid in 1943, production at the Teltow works very nearly ground to a halt. In 1945, at the end of the war, the Soviet occupation forces insisted that the company‚Äôs machinery in Teltow be dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union. Only a few months later, the company was back in business working with out-dated machinery. When the Soviet Military Administration expropriated Curt von Grueber Maschinenbauanstalt without paying any form of compensation in April 1948, Ernst Curt Loesche decided to leave Berlin and rebuild his company in one of the three western zones of occupation. After the expropriation of the Berlin works, Ernst Curt Loesche and some of the employees who had worked for him in Berlin began rebuilding the company, which was now known as Loesche Hartzerkleinerungs- und Zementmaschinen KG, in a ruined building in D√ºsseldorf in the summer of 1948. When Ernst Curt Loesche died unexpectedly in November of the same year, his son, Ernst Guenter, took over the business. Under his leadership and with its own manufacturing facility in Neuss, Loesche KG re- established itself in the 1950s and after 35 years as managing director of the company, Ernst Guenter Loesche retired in late 1983. With Dr. Thomas Loesche at the helm, the third generation of the Loesche family is now managing the company. In 1992 the company moved into a new, larger office building on Hansaallee. The collapse of economies in South-East Asia in 1997 plunged the company into a deep crisis. However, new ideas and the introduction of a series of rationalization measures enabled the company to recover. On August 1, 2008, Loesche GmbH founded Loesche Automation GmbH. The new company was active in the distribution and further development of the Loesche Industrial Automation product for crushing plants. On May 2009 the quality certificate was prolonged until 2012 by the internationally renowned certifier Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance (LRQA). Basis of this certification is the revision of ISO 9001:2008 valid since December 2008. In 2013, Loesche opened two new subsidiaries, one in Jakarta, Indonesia. Products Vertical roller mills for cement raw material. With two, three, four and six rollers, these mills were used for the first time in the 1930s to grind cement raw material. Vertical roller mills for cement clinker and blast furnace slag. Vertical roller mills are traditionally used for processing granulated blastfurnace slag and for grinding composite cements. The first use of one of the company's mills with a grinding-track diameter of just 1.1 m for grinding cement clinker had already been recorded back in 1935. Vertical roller mills for solid fuels. Containerised coal grinding plant CGPmobile. Mobile ore-grinding plant OGPmobile. Loesche Mill LM 70.4+4 On August 18, 2015, and together with mill manufacturer Loesche, Renk presented the new COPE Drive for Loesche mills in Augsburg. Other products include: vertical roller mills for ores and minerals, vertical roller mills for industrial minerals, dynamic classifiers. and hot gas generators. Partnerships and Acquisitions In 2012 Loesche GmbH and pyroprocessing specialist A TEC Holding GmbH of Austria have entered into a close cooperation agreement. In 2013 Loesche acquires the majority of stakes in the aixprocess and aixergee engineering companies based in Aachen, Germany. aixergee GmbH is specialised in the optimisation of production processes in the cement industry in the areas of alternative fuel firing, performance improvement, emissions reduction and stabilisation of plant operation. aixprocess GmbH develops models and tools for the simulation of complex process- and flow-relevant processes from the power plant and process engineering sectors. Renk AG, Augsburg/Germany and Loesche GmbH, Duesseldorf/Germany agree on exclusivity of the COPE drive concept for vertical roller mills. The COPE gearbox is primarily available for mill outputs between 4000 and 12 000 kW and represents a highly redundant innovative drive system for large and very large vertical mills.

Former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Former East Timorese President Jos√© Ramos-Horta witnessed the signing of the pacts during their bilateral meeting. The Philippines has pledged increased commerce and trade with East Timor and has also sought to cultivate cultural and educational exchanges. In 2010, when newly elected President Benigno Aquino III sworn in office, Timor-Leste President Jos√© Ramos-Horta expects stronger trade and diplomatic relations with the Philippines under his administration.

It can also be viewed as the problem of describing the solution set of the quantified constraint \\"Y(f(x))\\", where Y(y) is a constraint, for example, an inequality, describing the set Y. In most applications, f is a function from Rn to Rp and the set Y is a box of Rp (i.e. a Cartesian product of p intervals of R). When f is nonlinear the set inversion problem can be solved using interval analysis combined with a branch-and-bound algorithm. The main idea consists in building a paving of Rp made with non-overlapping boxes. For each box [x], we perform the following tests: # if f([x]) ‚äÇ Y we conclude that [x] ‚äÇ X; # if f([x]) ‚à© Y = ‚àÖ we conclude that [x] ‚à© X = ‚àÖ; # Otherwise, the box [x] the box is bisected except if its width is smaller than a given precision. To check the two first tests, we need an interval extension (or an inclusion function) [f] for f. Classified boxes are stored into subpavings, i.e., union of non overlapping boxes. The algorithm can be made more efficient by replacing the inclusion tests by contractors. Example The set X = f‚àí1([4,9]) where f(x1, x2) = x + x is represented on the figure. For instance, since [‚àí2,1]2 \\\\+ [4,5]2 = [0,4] + [16,25] = [16,29] does not intersect the interval [4,9], we conclude that the box [-2,1] √ó [4,5] is outside X. Since [‚àí1,1]2 \\\\+ [2,]2 = [0,1] + [4,5] = [4,6] is inside [4,9], we conclude that the whole box [-1,1] √ó [2,] is inside X. A ring defined as a set inversion problem Application Set inversion is mainly used for path planning, for nonlinear parameter set estimation , for localization or for the characterization of stability domains of linear dynamical systems. .

Rediff awarded the show 3.5/5 stars and stated that \\"The plotting: Two sisters, a man who's had a plastic surgery, a vicious boss, an airplane bombing, the sinister face of 24. What doesn't work? The dialogues. They're clunky, contrived, filmi and, at times, little more than a tacky translation. And this shortcoming ruins some potentially strong scenes or disconnects from the steadily brewing tension. While somewhat underwhelmed by the debut episode, I was hooked to the fast- paced, unflinchingly fierce (chopped finger, et al.), action-packed momentum of the second. 24's premise is such, every episode inches closer to a disclosure. It may not have the finish of the original but when you look at the bigger picture, Anil Kapoor's new show is a step in a desperately needed direction.\\" The Telegraph stated \\"... a big thumbs up to its well-chosen cast. Every actor fits perfectly into his or her role, with a special mention for Mandira Bedi's Nikita, Neil Bhoopalam's Aditya and Tisca Chopra's Trisha.\\" Season 2 Anil Kapoor, who was back with Season 2 of 24, received positive feedback from the viewers for his fresh outing. The actor was grateful for the critical acclaim he has been getting and makes sure he replies to every tweet that mentions him or 24. Critics praised Anil Kapoor, Sikander Kher and Ashish Vidyarthi for their acting skills. Parmita Uniyal of India Today stated \\"It's dark, it's uncomfortable, it will leave you asking for more\\". Second season The second season of the series also known as Day 2, commenced airing on 23 July 2016. The show is written by Rensil D'Silva, Niranjan Iyengar and Priya Pinto, directed by Abhinay Deo. began shooting in February 2016. Sakshi Tanwar, Surveen Chawla, Sikander Kher, Madhurima Tuli and Ashish Vidyarthi were announced as new main cast members. As with the original show, the plot concerns a mission to save the country from a tragedy, and later an attempt to implicate the conspirators responsible for it. Season 2 of 24 is loosely based on the third season of the original series, while borrowing some story elements from the second season. Plot summary Jai Singh Rathod, having battled alcohol issues in rehab, is estranged from his son Veer (Akshay Ajit Singh) who holds him responsible for his mother's (Tisca Chopra) death. Jai gets a terror mastermind Roshan Sherchan (Ashish Vidyarthi) arrested along with accomplice Shivani Malik (Sakshi Tanwar). But Roshan's brother Haroon Sherchan (Sikander Kher) has made a deadly plan. He threatens to infect Mumbai with a virus that can put everyone's life at risk. While members of the Anti Terrorism Unit (including Shivani Malik) are trying their best to solve the case, Jai Rathod, unbeknownst to them, is hatching a plan to free Roshan. Jai has drawn further ire from his son for being romantically involved with a new woman Maya (Surveen Chawla). Maya also has a connection to the terrorist brothers and is in a relationship with Haroon.

Known as chester cake in other areas, and gudge or donkey's gudge in Cork, it is similar to what is termed flies graveyard in parts of the UK, and consists of a thick layer of filling between two thin layers of pastry. The filling is a dark brown paste, containing a mixture of cake/bread crumbs, dried fruits (sultana raisins etc.), and a sweetener/binder. It has traditionally been a cheap confection, made from bakery leftovers. Its name is thought to be a contraction of \\"gurrier cake\\". Children who skipped school were known as gurriers and the act of skipping school became known as to be 'on the gur'. As Gur cake was made of leftovers, it was one of the cheaper item in bakeries and, therefore, one of the few items affordable to a child 'on the gur'. In bakeries, it is typically sold cut into squares of about 8 cm by 3 cm thick.

In 1913 he attended the National Training College in Nijmegen. Later he studied drawing at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague. William Henry Bik was his teacher. After his military service, he became a teacher in the municipality of The Hague, where he soon specialised in drawing lessons. From 1937 to 1963 he was professor in the painting department at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. His friend, Paul Citroen, also taught there. For a few years (1943-1949) he was Professor at the Institute Applied Art, which later became the Rietveld Academie.Elsie Drewes: Schrofer William (1898-1968), painter, maverick, Zutphen, Walburg Press, 1998 Schrofer was one of the founders of the Verve group - he coined the name. He was loved by his students; he received them at home and he taught them to be free to live and work. Among his pupils were: Hermanus Berserik, Toon Wegner and Co Westerik. His third wife, Hannie Bal, was also a painter. In his time he was a famous Hagenaar. Different styles Schrofer painted in different styles and was a nonconformist. In the 1930s and 1940s he produced abstract paintings. Around 1948, precisely at the time of Cobra, he moved onto figurative painting. With Paul Citroen, Rein Draijer, Willem Jacob Rozendaal and Han van Dam, he had great influence on the students who are now under the Nieuwe Haagse School banner. Workshop in Voorschoten In 1963 Schrofer set up a studio in Voorschoten in an old bakery on the Molenlaan.

This album was produced by Anthony Phillips, co-founder of Genesis. The album topped the new age and ambient charts around the world, and the track \\"Soldier of love\\" was used as an anthem by various spiritual organisations. Andy Latimer of Camel played lead guitar on \\"Soldier of love\\", and Phillips played classical guitar. Cellist Jemma Siddel, drummer Tristan Maillot, flautist Cynthia Robertson, oboist Anthony Freer (of The Enid) and violinist Ivor McGregor also played. In 1988, Asha recorded a collection of lightly orchestrated piano pieces on an album called Single as Love, and followed that with Mystic Heart in 1989, produced by Anthony Phillips. Unusually for the new age genre, Mystic Heart featured vocals, and also topped the new age and ambient charts. The \\"Missa Greca\\" (Greek Mass) is another track widely used as an anthem by spiritual organisations, from this album. Sharon Sage sang female vocals, and Greek-born Sufi scholar Aziz Dikeulias sang the doxastikon on this track. Albums for New World Music followed, and Denis Quinn had changed his name to Asha. In 1990, he made Wings of Fire, produced by New World Music colleague Phil Thornton, before recording for the last time with Anthony Phillips on Amadora, in 1991. Both these albums mixed instrumental passages with vocals, chants and mantras. Amadora featured euphonic vocals. Between 1992‚Äì1995, Asha recorded Fiery Moon, Field of Stars, and Marriage of the Sun and Moon with Thornton, all vocal and instrumental new age albums, as well as the purely instrumental Concert of Angels, Art of Love and a re-worked Single as Love. The instrumental Concert of Angels is still his best-selling title. Thornton played lead guitar and recorder on several tracks. Three more vocal and instrumental albums followed between 1996‚Äì1999, produced by contemporary new age artist James Asher. These were Resurrection, Love is the Only Prayer and Music for Love. \\"Return to your soul\\" from Music for Love was another track adopted by several spiritual organisations as an anthem. Tenor Philip Ball and classically trained singer Susanne Bramson appeared on Love is the Only Prayer and Music for Love. Asha's first concert was given in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1998, for the Theosophical Foundation there led by Tara Ananda Shah. Various Asha compilations were released by New World Music, including Celestine, Prophecy and Silent Night. East of East was released first on the Goodheart Music label, in 2005, after the break with New World Music, and later re-released by Dutch musician Roland van Steijn's Wolfeye Music in 2007. This was a singer-songwriter album, produced by Med Goodall, Phil Thornton and Roland van Steijn. Quinn then recorded two more albums with Phil Thornton, High Planes Music in 2007, and the double album Songs of Love and Chains in 2008, whilst also releasing several compilation back catalogue titles with Wolfeye Music, as well as Serpent in Paradise in 2008, produced by Roland van Steijn, who also played lead guitar. French author Michel Houellebecq adaptation of his novel to film The Possibility of an Island in 2008, used two Quinn pieces on the soundtrack, Amadora and In love. Rob Ayling's Voiceprint Records in 2009, re-released Open Secret with bonus vocal tracks, and Serpent in Paradise, and a double CD of 'greatest hits' called Forgotten Language of the Heart, after which Asha founded Singing Stone Music. Falling Through Time (2010), O Great Spirit (2011) and Sacred Songs (2012) were three albums produced by Shaun Britton, with vocals added by Jimena Larraguivel and Jaba on Falling Through Time, and lead guitar by Kristian Biddiss. In 2013 Asha released State of Grace, produced by Dutch studio engineer Arno op Den Camp. State of Grace features collaborations with Myristica, and additional vocals by Kerani and Em√∂ke Labancz. 2014 saw several outputs:Heal Your Heart (new versions of some previous songs), Sun, Sorrow, Flowers, Moon (a third volume of cover versions following on from the double album Songs of Love and Chains and Heart and Soul Rhapsodies, a new collection of improvised piano vignettes all produced with Arno op Den Camp in the Netherlands. In 2015 came The Blessing & the Bliss, followed by Thunderheart in 2016, both produced by Tim Rock in Norfolk, the UK. 2016 saw Asha move to Spend more time in Budapest. In 2017 he released both Calvary Hill, begun with Tim Rock producing and completed with Cserny K√°lm√°n at Origo Studio, in Budapest, and Knights & Angels made at Origo Studio. G√©za Kremnitzky of the Hungarian folk due Hungarikum Egy√ºttes played guitar, mandolin, recorder and mouth-organ on both albums, and Sz√©kely Ilus (Yloush) sang on Knights & Angels. Since 2004, Asha has performed in the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, Iceland, Denmark, Hungary (for the Napf√©nyes √âlet Alapitv√°ny), Germany (for the Rainbow Spirit Festival) and Finland.  Musical style  Asha has been influenced by exposure to Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Bob Marley, and is interested in the Sufi tradition and reading the Christian mysticism of Rudolf Steiner. He was initiated into the Sufi order of Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan in 1988, the same year that he legally changed his name from Denis to Asha. He now lives in Budapest, where he takes an interest in the Napf√©nyes √âlet Alapitv√°ny (the Sunny Life Community), an esoteric Christian community Cafe.

Robert B. McNeill (May 21, 1915 - July 15, 1975) was a Presbyterian minister who was the pastor of several southern churches in the 1940s to the 1960s. After writing an article in Look magazine, he was dismissed from his position as pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Columbus, Georgia, due to his views on race and racial segregation. Though McNeill was not the only southern pastor to be removed due to his views on segregation, the incident garnered a great deal of media attention and negative press for the south and the commission which dismissed him, especially because McNeill was a southerner himself. Early life Robert B. McNeill was born on May 21, 1915, in Birmingham, Alabama to Walter Patterson McNeill and Mary McLeod McNeill. His mother and father were both southerners and Scottish, and taught McNeill that he \\"was an exceedingly lucky person to be white, American, and Southern, but above all to be of Scotch descent.\\" As a boy, like most southerners, he was raised by an African American \\"cook-nurse.\\" Because his middle-class neighborhood, known as Enon Ridge, and later to be called \\"Dynamite Hill\\" due to bombings by the Ku Klux Klan, was next to the African American neighborhood called East Thomas, there was a persistent fear that African Americans would move into the neighborhood and drive the prices down. As a child, he internalized this adult fear, as many other children did, and would throw rocks at the African American boys who ventured into the neighborhood. However, he also looked up to an African American man named Bob Perdue who worked on the neighbor's yard, and was very attached to his cook-nurse, whom he had the duty of walking home from the age of 12. Whenever a cook quit, it was his job to discover prospects for a replacement, leading him to go from door to door in the African American ghetto of East Thomas, judging the women and their houses to decide if they were appropriate to invite to speak to his mother about the job, giving him a larger experience with African Americans than most of the boys he knew. Like many other Southerners at the time, as a child he enjoyed the company of particular African Americans, but did not feel the same about African Americans as a whole. Education McNeill began school at the age of seven, and attended Graymont Grammar School for the first seven grades. Then, from 1928 to 1932, he attended Phillips High. He was never particularly scholarly, nor good at sports, and spent most of his school years in obscurity. Upon graduating high school, he attended Birmingham-Southern College, where he graduated during the middle of the Great Depression. While in the college, chapel was mandatory. One week, the message was preached by Methodist Rev. Henry Hitt Crane. Afterwards, McNeill spoke with Crane, who asked him if he had considered entering the ministry. While McNeill did not initially believe this was his purpose, he would remember the man's comment for the rest of his life. Instead, he entered the law school at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa in 1936. While working as a night short-order cook, he attempted to study law, but was largely unimpressed with the attitude of his fellow students and professors, especially the claim made by one professor: \\"It doesn't make a damn what's right, but what the law is.\\" In the summer of 1937, he worked for Linde Air Products, intending to return to law school after earning enough money. However, after the death of his father and considerable internal debate, he decided instead to attend Union Presbyterian Seminary in 1939 to become a Presbyterian minister. He had hoped to find seminary less hypocritical than law school; however, he would come to consider much of seminary life as hypocritical as his law professor had been. McNeill would become involved in a battle to end a system of table seating that acted similarly to sororities. Older students would choose which of the freshmen were worthy to join their \\"table,\\" denying access to those who were less intelligent or socially awkward, and alumni would return to the table that they had been at when they were in the seminary. The first attempt to end the table seating system failed, and one man commented that \\"the outcome was the will of God,\\" introducing McNeill to the concept that \\"the status quo equals the will of God.\\" Though the attempt to end the system had failed the first year, it would pass the next. Furthermore, while he attended the school, he felt that \\"We were to preach on temperance but not prohibition, justice but not politics, greed but not economics, prejudice but not segregation, and so on.\\" While in seminary, McNeill felt they were taught that it was not the job of a pastor to encourage social justice. After his first year, he was made the student minister to a small church in Virginia. Though he had been assigned to preach and work at the church every other Sunday from fall of 1940 to the spring of 1942, he ended up losing the position by the end of the spring term of 1941. Though he admitted in his biography that he was not perfect, he felt that he had done an average job for a student. However, the position was controlled by two members, who paid the salary, and who had disapproved of him personally. The experience taught him that he \\"hated snobbery,\\" and that his attempts to \\"be the conformist\\" had failed, and that he had \\"betrayed his integrity\\" by doing so. McNeill felt that his \\"first formal experience in race relations\\" was an interseminary conference in 1940, where he was one of the delegates. The conference was integrated, and for the first time, he met African Americans his same age with the same education as him, and realized for the first time that they were on the same level as him. While he had begun reluctantly, he concluded that \\"It wasn't bad at all.\\" Ministerial Life Upon graduating seminary in 1942, he was offered a part-time position at the University of Kentucky, where he would be minister for the Presbyterian students. While there, he would gain a master's degree in philosophy, and he would meet Jeanne Lancaster, whom he married in August 1944. While he was serving as minister to students, he would have a moderate position on race issues, believing that \\"occasional exposure to each other was good for both races\\", but never advocating any direct end to segregation. In 1945, he became minister to students at the University of Texas for one year. His students invited a choir from a local African American college, and insisted upon the meeting being integrated. He supported the students' freedom to choose this option, but the session and elders opposed this, claiming that it would cause divisions. Because of a shortage of available housing, he soon left this position. While he had never taken any stance against segregation, he was beginning to feel he could no longer be a moderate, and began to realize \\"that racism was another one of those uniforms of snobbery that [he] detested.\\" In the summer of 1945, he became pastor of an actual church instead of simply being a minister at a university. The church was located in Fairfield Highlands, near to Birmingham, Alabama. While working at the church, McNeill began to study the issue of segregation, beginning with Gunnar Myrdal's An American Dilemma, and other books. He also went back to visit his old neighborhood, and spoke with an African American man, whose house had been bombed by the Ku Klux Klan, but who had rebuilt and steadfastly remained. These influences led him to feel ashamed of the South, and though he was not yet in favor of integration because of a fear of \\"the social convulsion\\" he knew would come, he could no longer ignore the issue. After this, in 1947, he moved on to Jacksonville, Alabama, where he would pastor a church of only 120 members. While he was still not an advocate of integration, he did preach on Race Relations Sunday a sermon entitled \\"The Dark Blot on Democracy,\\" which, for its time, was \\"provocative,\\" according to McNeill's autobiography. An elder's wife commented to him that \\"I enjoyed that sermon‚Äîno, I didn't‚ÄîI needed to hear it.\\" In 1950, he was chairman of the Christian Relations Committee for the synod. The committee was not intended to speak on race; however, he chose to do so, and in his report to the synod claimed that \\"We are faced with two inevitables, the Federal Constitution and the Christian conscience. Both dictate that legal segregation shall not last forever.\\" The report did not encourage integration; it simply asked that the church \\"Work toward all possible accomplishment under the separate-but equal doctrine now in effect.\\" The report passed, 45 to 22; however, the opponents made sure to register their names against it, a demonstration of their fierce opposition. In 1951, he was approached by a pastor-seeking committee from First Presbyterian Church of Columbus, Georgia. The church had 1,200 members, making it much larger than his current pastorate. McNeill accepted their call. For a time, life went smoothly at the church. In 1954, the southern branch of the Presbyterian Church, was considering rejoining the northern, and ending the split existing since the Civil War. His church attempted to influence him to vote against rejoining, but McNeill refused, choosing instead to vote for the church to be unified. The measure to rejoin the northern church failed, and some members of the congregation were displeased with McNeill for his unpopular vote. In 1956, an African American doctor named Brewer, who had been the head of the local NAACP, was murdered. All the pastors condemned the murder; but McNeill stated that \\"I am primarily concerned with the thousands of us who created the spiritual climate that made this act possible and with those who approve it,\\" which displeased some of the congregation. They were also displeased with his handling of the issue of Little Rock, where he refused to condemn the federal action in enforcing integration. Expulsion from First Presbyterian Church Article in Look Magazine In April 1957, Chester Morrison, an editor of Look magazine, asked McNeill to author an article denouncing the Ku Klux Klan. McNeill delayed, initially reluctant due to the possible reprisals such an article would create, but agreed to meet with Morrison. After discussing the issue with his wife, McNeill agreed to write an article, which he and Morrison decided would be on a southern minister's approach to the overall problem of segregation, instead of being directly against the Klan. Though the article itself was not \\"anti-southern,\\" it was written for Look magazine, which some members felt was \\"a South-killer magazine.\\" McNeill called the elders and deacons to a joint meeting, where he read the article. The article was mild, only encouraging \\"creative contact\\" and not even full integration. Even though it was mild, an opposition to McNeill had formed. They requested that the Presbytery come and \\"straighten out the affairs of our church.\\" While the complaint made no mention of the Look article, the article was the true cause of the complaint. A judicial commission was sent. The commission made no charges, but advised McNeill that it would likely be best for him to accept a call to another church, as the church had become split. In the meantime, in November 1958, it dissolved the session, which had been hindering McNeill, and \\"admonished the members to protect the freedom of the pulpit.\\" However, the brief peace was soon broken. Steve Lesher, a reporter of the Columbus Ledger, wrote an article about McNeill, that was meant to be published in Look magazine. The article was to tell a positive story of how \\"a spokesman for racial justice [was] finally accepted by his community.\\" However, Look magazine was still considered an \\"anti-southern\\" magazine to the congregation. To prevent controversy, McNeill published in the Sunday bulletin a statement asking the congregation to \\"Reserve your judgment until the article appears.\\" Though the article itself never appeared in Look magazine, the word of it angered the antagonists, and convinced the commission that McNeill would no longer be able to be pastor of the church. Expulsion In June 1959, the chairman of the Judicial Commission informed McNeill that by a unanimous decision, McNeill would no longer be pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Columbus, Georgia. They stated in a speech on Sunday, June 7, while announcing their decision to the congregation that \\"The time has now come when, what has been the voice of the pulpit, should also become the voice of the people of the church as a witnessing whole. This leading through united church groups calls for a ministry where the emphasis is from a united church instead of from the pulpit alone‚Ä¶\\" As a consequence, the commission said that \\"the interest of religion\\" required McNeill to vacate the pulpit after the evening service. After this announcement, McNeill preached a farewell sermon. Time magazine would print this excerpt: \\"We in the South can no longer speak in terms of democracy or justice without making a parenthetical exception for an entire people. When we make this exception time after time in everything we do, we have lost the capacity to reason logically. I have grown to despise a particular word. That word is 'compromise.' Have you noticed how everybody is a moderate these days? Everybody is rushing toward the middle ground. We'll have to revise our terminology now. We'll have to refer to left moderates, right moderates and middle moderates. This type of so-called moderate will be caught up and squeezed in the very middle he has created for himself.\\" Media Reaction This incident drew a great amount of media attention to McNeill, who \\"was bombarded with calls from all over the country,\\" especially because when the Judicial Commission presented its report there were several newspaper reporters in the audience. The New York Times printed an article on June 9, entitled \\"Mr. McNeill's 'Crime'\\", denouncing the \\"racial bigotry\\" of removing McNeill from his post as pastor. The article suggested that by doing so, many in the South would be \\"disgust[ed]\\" and that the injustice of actions of the commission would \\"win his views more sympathetic attention.\\" Time magazine also wrote of the incident on June 22, 1959. They described how the congregation had protested the chairman's decision, telling him that \\"You have been listening to the wrong people,\\" and noting that \\"Some women in the choir burst into tears.\\" Time magazine also noted that there were only 50 members of the 1,200 member church who were advocating for McNeill's dismissal. Jet magazine published a paragraph on the incident in its August 27, 1959 issue, stating that McNeill \\"was dismissed as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Columbus because of his views on racial integration.\\" On July 12, The Miami News published a large article chronicling the story, and saying that \\"Nowhere has the South's tragic cleavage on the racial question produced a more shattering effect.\\" Heart Attack The stress of the press's attention, as well as the stress that had been on McNeill from the challenge of running the church, caused him to have a heart attack while spending time with his children at a bowling alley, three days after he had been dismissed. He was kept in the hospital for twenty six days. Despite his dismissal, some of the women of the former church of his took turns sitting at a table in front of his hospital door, preventing any one from bothering him, so that he could successfully recover from his stressful ordeal. He received notes from all over the country, though he only received the chance to read them once he was out of the hospital. Even those who were opposed to his ideas still sent him \\"notes of sympathy,\\" though there were also those who were of the belief \\"that the Lord finally had 'taken care of him.'\\" Acceptance of Position at Bream Memorial Presbyterian Church After he had recovered from his heart attack, McNeill decided to take up a position at Bream Memorial Presbyterian Church, located in Charleston, West Virginia. The church had contacted him before he was dismissed, asking him to replace their pastor, who had plans to retire. McNeill requested that they be sure that the congregation still wanted him, after the media storm. The church again replied that they would have him as a pastor, one of the elders making the comment \\"What kind of people do you think we are, that we would let you down now?\\" The decision was reported as unanimous, and in September 1959, he moved to Charleston. He began work on a part-time basis. It soon became apparent that the senior pastor did not plan to retire, and resented McNeill as a threat to his job. Papers of the incident in Columbus were spread among the congregation, and a commission was called in once more. This time, the commission sided with McNeill, and the former pastor was dismissed. However, the stress caused McNeill to suffer from a heart attack again in February 1961, and he was hospitalized for six weeks. Afterwards, he returned to Bream Memorial Presbyterian Church and served as its pastor. Published Work McNeill wrote the book Prophet, Speak Now! which was published in 1961 by John Knox Press. In it he uses the models of Old Testament prophets such as Moses, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Amos, and Micah and Jesus Christ in the New Testament to encourage pastors to live out the prophetic role today. McNeill also published an autobiographical book chronicling his experience entitled God Wills Us Free, which was published in 1965. He would be quoted by Jet magazine, stating that \\"Whites have been 'looting' Negroes for three centuries, so they set the stage for the explosion which has come,\\" in response to the massive riots of 1967.

The two eventually marry and he buys her mother a house. Business gets rough between Cook and BV and their professional relationship and friendship end. Faye feels increasingly guilty about her affair with Cook, and finally tells BV, who breaks up with her. Faye then has a relationship with Zoey, a French woman living in the US. Rhonda begins to feel uncomfortable with Cook's wild lifestyle, which includes sex with other women and drugs. BV dates New Yorker Amanda for some time, but eventually they break up too. Rhonda takes her own life, leaving Cook shocked and saddened. Faye and BV reconnect and start dating again. Later, BV moves back west to his hometown to take care of his sick father and the rest of his family, and pursues a simpler life, taking a job as a worker at a drilling rig. Faye follows him and the two of them declare their eternal love for each other. =Cast= Florence Welch, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, The Black Lips, Alan Palomo, John Lydon, Flea, Spank Rock, Tegan Quin, Sara Quin, Anthony Kiedis, Chad Smith, Josh Klinghoffer, First Aid Kit, Erik Sprague and Big Freedia, all make cameo appearances in the film. Production Development In November 2011 it was announced that Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara and Haley Bennett had been cast in the film. The film was originally titled Lawless, but Malick allowed filmmaker John Hillcoat to use the title for his 2012 film. When the film was announced as in pre- production in November 2011 the production company was FilmNation Entertainment and its producers were Sarah Green and Nicolas Gonda. In November 2012 it was announced that B√©r√©nice Marlohe had joined the cast. It was revealed in March 2015 the title was Weightless. In February 2016 Sarah Green confirmed the title was Weightless, but it was later changed to Song to Song. In December 2016 it was announced that Iggy Pop, John Lydon, Arcade Fire, Alan Palomo, Iron & Wine, Fleet Foxes and The Black Lips would appear in the film. Filming Rooney Mara said in December 2011 that filming was scheduled to begin in September 2012. That month, scenes were shot in Austin, Texas. In March 2012 Alan Palomo of Neon Indian shot scenes for the film. In October 2012 Mara, Michael Fassbender, Florence Welch and Holly Hunter were spotted on set filming. Mara said in an interview that Patti Smith shot scenes for the film, playing herself. In November 2012 Val Kilmer was spotted filming. Christian Bale only shot three days on the film. Post- production Post-production on the film took longer than expected because the film's eight-hour first cut required Malick to ask the financiers and studios more than once for additional time. In October 2013 Michael Fassbender provided voice-over that the actor said might be cut from the completed film: \\"I'm not sure [if I'm in the final cut]. I've got to go actually and do some more voice-over ... just like reams and reams of that.\\" Bale also expressed doubts about whether he would appear, saying in November 2013, \\"I unfortunately wasn't able to do everything I was meant to do, so I ended up doing like three, four days on that. Which in Terry's world means you're never going to see me in it.\\" In January 2016 Mara revealed she did voice-over for the film. Bale, Haley Bennett, Benicio del Toro, Arcade Fire, Iron & Wine, Fleet Foxes, Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes and Angela Bettis were all cut from the film. Release In February 2015 Broad Green Pictures acquired U.S distribution rights to the film. It had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2017. The film was released on March 17, 2017. Reception Song to Song has polarized film critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 43% approval rating based on 122 critics and an average rating of 5.37/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"As visually sumptuous as it is narratively spartan, Terrence Malick's Song to Song echoes elements of the writer-director's recent work‚Äîfor better and for worse.\\" On Metacritic the film holds a rating of 54 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In a five-star review for The Independent, Christopher Hooton claimed that it has become fashionable among critics to ridicule Malick's recent films, but that given a chance the film is a \\"masterpiece\\" and even \\"life-changing\\". In Entertainment Weekly, Joe McGovern derided it as \\"incoherent, disconnected, self-interrupting, obsessed with pointless minutiae and crammed full of odd, limp stabs at profundity [...] you‚Äôll find yourself searching in the margins of each shot for something or someone tangible to grasp onto.\\" Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film two and a half out of four stars.

The campaign involved members of the community creating rainbow pedestrian crossings in chalk to protest the removal of a temporary rainbow crossing from Oxford Street in Sydney. The temporary crossing was created by the City of Sydney as part of the 35th-anniversary celebration of the Sydney Mardi Gras. When the crossing was to be removed, the community protests and internet activism campaign emerged. In 2019 a permanent Sydney rainbow crossing was unveiled in Taylor Square, on the corner of Bourke and Campbell streets. History The rainbow flag or gay pride flag, is associated with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and LGBT activities around the world. Rainbow crosswalks, Taipei, Taiwan 2008 The idea to create rainbow crosswalks appears to have first emerged in Taipei, Taiwan . A campaign for promoting gender equality organized by the National Taiwan Normal University at the beginning of June, 2008. The creators were Dr.Prof. Jerry H. Hsia and the creative team formed by the Graduate School of Fine Arts, NTNU.  Federal Highway Administration Advisory, 2011  In 2011, the United States Federal Highway Agency advised \\"that ‚Äúcrosswalk art is actually contrary to the goal of increased safety and most likely could be a contributing factor to a false sense of security for both motorists and pedestrians.‚Äù Rainbow crosswalks, West Hollywood 2012 The idea to create rainbow crosswalks in West Hollywood was part of the 2012 Gay Pride Month celebrations, initially proposed by the LA-based artist Martin Duvander with the crosswalks at the intersection of San Vicente Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard painted rainbow colours for the month of June. Rainbow crosswalks, Tel Aviv 2012 In May 2012, Tel Aviv city hall painted a crosswalk in rainbow colours for a photo shoot to promote TYP: Ivri Lider and Johnny Goldstein, the act scheduled to headline the Gay Pride Parade's main concert. These photos, reminiscent of the Beatles Abbey Road album cover were posted on Facebook and the crosswalk was repainted white a few hours later. Rainbow crossing, Sydney 2013 The project to create a temporary rainbow crossing in Sydney was modelled on the similar crossings in West Hollywood. On 10 December 2012, City of Sydney Council voted in favour of creating temporary Rainbow Crossings on Oxford Street as a trial, \\"subject to relevant State Government approvals\\". The location chosen, Oxford Street by Taylor Square, was the starting point of the original Sydney Gay Mardi Gras and the crossing was to form part of the 35th anniversary celebrations. The estimated cost of the Rainbow Crossing was $110,000, which included painting, compulsory video surveillance and eventual removal. The rainbow crossing in Sydney proved popular with tourists and locals and many people hoped it would be made a permanent feature of the Oxford Street landscape. During the community debate over the future of the rainbow crossing, following the Sydney Mardi Gras, the NSW government Minister for Roads and Ports, Duncan Gay MLC, published a letter to the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, listing the reasons for the removal of the temporary crossing on the grounds of pedestrian safety. On Tuesday 9 April 2013, the temporary crossing was removed.  Rainbow crosswalks, St. Louis 2015  In June 2015, rainbow crossings at Tower Grove and Manchester Crossing in St. Louis, Missouri were painted to celebrate the legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2016, the city decided to follow the Federal Highway Administration's 2011 advice and prohibited rainbow and fleur- de-lis crosswalks.  Rainbow crosswalks, Seattle 2015  A standoff between police and protesters at a rainbow crosswalk on Capitol Hill during the left In 2015, eleven rainbow crossings were painted in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood.

Rainbow crossing, Sydney 2019 Rainbow Crossing at Taylor Square in March 2019 On 8 February 2019, a permanent Sydney rainbow crossing was unveiled in Taylor Square, on the corner of Bourke and Campbell streets.  Rainbow crosswalk, Albuquerque 2019  In early June 2019, the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico unveiled a rainbow crosswalk on historic US Route 66. Just a few days later, a motorcycle gang caused a significant amount of damage to the $30,000 crossing with their motorcycles. Even though at least a dozen bikers were shown on video, only one man, a Trump supporter named Anthony Morgan was arrested for the crime.  Rainbow crosswalks, Ames, Iowa 2019  In early September 2019, the city council of Ames, Iowa cut the ribbon on a rainbow crosswalk. Subsequently the Federal Highway Administration sent them a letter \\"requesting\\" that it be removed. The city council ignored the letter.  Rainbow crosswalks, San Diego 2020  On January 11, 2010, a rainbow crosswalk was unveiled under the pre-existing rainbow flag in the Hillcrest neighborhood in San Diego, California. Openly lesbian State Senate President pro tem Toni Atkins and openly gay Assemblymember Todd Gloria praised \\"out and proud\\" city council member Chris Ward for \\"getting the job done.\\" Openly lesbian council members Jennifer Campbell and Georgette Gomez also attended the \\"Catwalk on the Crosswalk.\\" Community protests and internet activism The removal of the crossing inspired a rainbow chalk community protest started by Sydney local James Brechney. People followed his lead by creating their own DIY rainbow crossings with chalk and sharing pictures on social media. The campaign also featured internet activism with the Facebook Page, DIY Rainbow. Pictures of chalk rainbow crossings from many places around the world appeared on social media including Paris, Shanghai, Pretoria, Thailand and Cambodia. Facebook would later credit DIY Rainbow as one of the top 10 pages of Facebook over its first 10 years. Summer Hill Rainbow Crossing Support for the rainbow crossing spread across Sydney, including local communities. On 14 April 2013, in response to the removal of the Rainbow Crossing in Oxford St, Darlinghurst, parents and children from several local schools chalked a rainbow in the public square at Summer Hill, as part of the DIY Rainbow Crossing movement. The Summer Hill Rainbow Crossing On 15 April 2013, Ashfield Council workers removed the rainbow.http://www.ashfield.nsw.gov.au/ After media attention, council issued a statement labelling it a slip hazard and requested a permit be obtained before it could be re-chalked. The events were covered in The Daily Telegraph, The Australian,http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/chalk- rainbow-crossings-washed-from-city-streets-by- councils/story-e6frg6n6-1226620872192 Perth Now, and on 2DAY FM. On 17 April 2013, it was rechalked by more than 100 people, including local councillor, Alex Lofts. On 18 April, it was again removed, only to be re-chalked. Since that date it has remained chalked. A group of families and supporters continue to chalk the rainbow, especially after rain. This group has also ensured the area remains free of litter; they also hold occasional performances and arts- related celebrations at the site. Some local businesses have offered discounts and support for the rainbow, these display a logo with a stylised image of the rainbow crossing on it. A Summer Hill Rainbow Crossing Facebook page was used to support the community protest. At an Ashfield Council meeting on 28 May 2013 the council passed a motion that a permanent outline of a rainbow be painted in Summer Hill Square, with the understanding that this may be periodically 'chalked in' by children, families and community members. Wider adoption of the protest movement The original DIY rainbow crossing protest movement was generated by the debate over the rainbow crossing in Sydney, however DIY rainbow crossings continue to appear as protests in other settings including a crossing outside the Russian embassy in Stockholm, Sweden in August 2013 believed to be in protest against new legislation in Russia.

It has been neglected and requires rehabilitation. Kyimbi River The Kyimbi River originates in the Mugandja plateau at a height of . It contains a series of falls over a distance of , with the largest high. The total drop in this section is over . They are among the highest falls in the African continent to be used for power generation. In the dry season the average flow is , but this rises to in the rainy season. Planning In 1948 it was reported that a company had been formed to build a hydroelectric plant on the Kyimbi river in the north of Katanga, to supply Albertville (now called Kalemie). Operations were expected to start in 1950. The plant was to be built near Bendera. This is about from Albertville. There were delays. A 1952 report said that construction was still planned. A 1954 report described the planned structure as a dam high that would provide water to five generating units, each with capacity, or in total. The plant was eventually built and operated by the Forces de L'Est du Congo (FEC), a company that began operations in 1955 to provide power to the eastern Congo. It began delivering power from two of the five planned turbines in 1959. Additional turbines were to be installed as needed to meet demand. The architect Eugene Palumbo, assigned to the Congo by UNESCO, designed the service city of the dam construction project. Dam and power plant The dam is above the main Kiymbi waterfalls and consists of a concrete arc in length, with a crest altitude of . The dam's capacity is about . Water is carried away from the dam in a horizontal direction along a covered channel, or gallery, to a point above the power station. The gallery is partially lined with concrete, with a width of where it is lined and where it is unlined. The gallery terminates in a de- sanding chamber long and in diameter which eliminates any sand particles larger than in diameter. The sand is flushed down a gully to the river below. From a tank at the end of the de-sander the water is fed to the power plant by a steep conduit long with a diameter decreasing from . The drop is about . The water powers the turbines and is discharged into the river below the waterfalls. The power station came online in 1959 with two 8,250 kilowatt generators, with potential for three more of the same capacity. A 132 kW line carried the electricity to Albertville. Rehabilitation plans The Democratic Republic of the Congo became independent in June 1960. The state electricity company, Soci√©t√© nationale d'√©lectricit√© (SNEL), prepared a study of rehabilitating the Kiymbi power station in 1992. A 2007 report prepared for the World Bank evaluated rehabilitation of the power plant. The very rough estimate of cost from a \\"reconnaissance\\" study would be US$52.06 million for 43 MW installed capacity. The report recommended making a priority of a more detailed study.

However his outstanding role in international bioethics never favoured his possible appointment as a member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee (CNB), owing to his lay position focused on the rights of self-determination and his criticism of the status of a committee as the CNB, appointed not by a pluralistic parliament, but by the government.Giovanni Incorvati, \\"Identity and status of the Italian National Bioethics Committee : contrasting paradigms (1990-2006)\\", in Journal International de Bio√©thique, vol. 18, 1-2, p. 59-83: 77 n. 70.

Probus, circa 280: both Probus and Sol Invictus driving his chariot a radiate solar crown Coin of the Roman emperor Aurelian, 274-275: Aurelian and Sol Invictus are wearing a radiate crown Coin of the Roman emperor Gordian III, 240's AD: Gordian III (shown in profile on the obverse) is wearing a radiate crown A radiant or radiate crown, also known as a solar crown, sun crown, Eastern crown, or tyrant's crown, is a crown, wreath, diadem, or other headgear symbolizing the sun or more generally powers associated with the sun. Apart from the Ancient Egyptian form of a disc between two horns, it is shaped with a number of narrowing bands going outwards from the wearer's head, to represent the rays of the sun. These may be represented either as flat, on the same plane as the circlet of the crown, or rising at right angles to it. History In the iconography of ancient Egypt, the solar crown is taken as a disc framed by the horns of a ram or cow. It is worn by deities such as Horus in his solar or hawk-headed form, Hathor, and Isis. It may also be worn by pharaohs. In Ptolemaic Egypt, the solar crown could also be a radiate diadem, modeled after the type worn by Alexander the Great (as identified with the sun god Helios) in art from the mid-2nd century BC onward. It was perhaps influenced by contact with the Shunga Empire, and a Greco-Bactrian example is depicted at the great stupa of Bharhut. The first ruler of Egypt shown wearing this version of a solar crown was Ptolemy III Euergetes (246‚Äì222 BC). In the Roman Empire, the solar crown was worn by Roman emperors, especially in association with the cult of Sol Invictus, influenced also by radiate depictions of Alexander. Although Augustus is shown wearing one in a posthumous coin, after his deification, and Nero on at least one coin while he was alive, it only became common, and sometimes usual, on coins in the 3rd century. Histories record that Gallienus at least wore an actual crown in public.The World of Roman Costume, Eds Judith Lynn Sebesta, Larissa Bonfante, p.82, 2001, Univ of Wisconsin Press, , 9780299138547, google books The solar crown worn by Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, was reinterpreted as representing the \\"Holy Nails\\". Much later, the radiate crown became associated with Liberty personified, usually in a form as though a circular disc with radiating rays in different directions was worn. This may first appear in the Great Seal of France from 1848 (and subsequently under French republics), and is best known from the Statue of Liberty. From the Renaissance on the ancient Colossus of Rhodes, a statue of Helios, was often shown with such a crown, although its appearance is now uncertain.

Four people were killed by Roger Herbert Haglund in the space of one year. Crimes On 3 September 1991, the siblings Aase Helene and Arne Odvar Nordby, aged 78 and 74, were murdered by multiple stab wounds across their bodies and then were robbed in their home in Tistedalen.K√•re Hunstad & Harald Haave: Drapene i Tistedal (Oslo, 1993) p. 13 In spite of a massive and prolonged criminal investigation, which included the arrests of two innocent persons, the case seemed destined to remain unsolved.K√•re Hunstad & Harald Haave: Drapene i Tistedal (Oslo, 1993) p. 60 There were few clues and no eyewitnesses. A few days previous to the crime however, the siblings had become concerned when they came across an unknown man in their garden. It was dark and they had been unable to recognize the man, who claimed to be looking for a dog.K√•re Hunstad & Harald Haave: Drapene i Tistedal (Oslo, 1993) p. 22-23 One year later, on 1 September 1992, a 71-year-old pensioner in Tistedalen, Per R√∏d, was hit in the jaw with an iron bar, then stabbed to death and dumped in a compost pile in his garden.K√•re Hunstad & Harald Haave: Drapene i Tistedal (Oslo, 1993) p. 74 He was reported missing, but the police were unable to find a body, and so it remained a missing persons case for some time. The victim's car was found in a remote area and his hunting rifle was no longer hanging on the wall in his living room. It wasn't until March 1993 that two neighbors accidentally uncovered the body of Per Madsen. It was discovered that he had been stabbed repeatedly. By now the police had four unsolved murders on their hands, as in the interim, on 23 December 1992, a 54-year-old food store manager named Karl Johan Hagevik was found shot in the back of the head in his car. The killer had not taken the victim's money, but instead grabbed Hagevik's bag consisting of three liters of milk.K√•re Hunstad & Harald Haave: Drapene i Tistedal (Oslo, 1993) p. 88-89 At this point this small urban area near Halden became the focal point of one of the most extensive police investigations in post war Norway. When darkness fell Tistedalen was transformed into a ghost town, the population seemingly living in fear.K√•re Hunstad & Harald Haave: Drapene i Tistedal (Oslo, 1993) p. 124-125 Investigation The police soon established a connection between the three murder cases, as the crimes apparently had been motivated by robbery. Evidence also suggested that the killer was also behind a recent bank robbery in L√•by outside Halden. After months of painstaking investigation, carried out in cooperation with National Criminal Investigation Service, the police were able to apprehend Roger Herbert Haglund, a 55-year- old family man from Tistedalen, on 1 May 1993. The evidence against him was strong from the onset. Roger Haglund's alibi did not hold up to scrutiny, and he was in dire financial straits. To the police investigators who interrogated him, Haglund came across as an unusually cold person. Confronted with the evidence the investigators had uncovered, Haglund confessed, then later retracted his confession, claiming that the infamous murderer and sex offender Edgar Antonsen, who had taken his own life the same year, had forced him to falsely confess to the crimes. When the trial began Haglund folded under the weight of the prosecutor's case, and he confessed again. Public prosecutor Lasse Qvigstad presented the accused as a cold and calculating man who murdered his defenseless victims, then took his time to look for valuables in their homes.Det Hendte 1994 (Oslo, 1995), p. 97 Roger Herbert Haglund, who the court described as an \\"ice cold psychopath,\\" was found guilty and on 26 April 1994 sentenced to 21 years in prison and 5 years preventive detention. The day after the sentencing it was uncovered that Haglund was planning to take a hostage and escape from prison armed with a fake dynamite stick, and he was immediately transferred to a maximum security prison. During the investigation Haglund was connected to an unusual brutal double murder in Sweden, committed a few years prior, but he was never prosecuted. Sentence and release Haglund served 13 years of his sentence before being released on parole. By that time he was in poor health. He settled in Skedsmo, then moved to Str√∏mmen, where he died, at the age of 73, on 9 December 2011.

Given a Boolean formula, the SAT problem asks for an assignment of variables so that the entire formula evaluates to true. The internal workings of CDCL SAT solvers were inspired by DPLL solvers. Conflict-driven clause learning was proposed by Marques-Silva and Sakallah (1996, 1999) and Bayardo and Schrag (1997).  Background  Background knowledge about the following issues is needed to have a clear idea about the CDCL algorithm.

An example of such a formula is: :( (not A) or (not C) ) and (B or C), or, using a common notation:In the pictures below, \\"+\\" is used to denote \\"or\\", and multiplcation to denote \\"and\\". :(A' \\\\lor C') \\\\land (B \\\\lor C) where A,B,C are Boolean variables, A', C', B, and C are literals, and A' \\\\lor C' and B \\\\lor C are clauses. A satisfying assignment for this formula is e.g.: :A = False, B = False , C = True since it makes the first clause true (since A' is true) as well as the second one (since C is true). This examples uses three variables (A, B, C), and there are two possible assignments (True and False) for each of them. So one has 2^3 = 8 possibilities. In this small example, one can use brute-force search to try all possible assignments and check if they satisfy the formula. But in realistic applications with millions of variables and clauses brute force search is impractical. The responsibility of a SAT solver is to find a satisfying assignment efficiently and quickly by applying different heuristics for complex CNF formulas.  Unit clause rule (unit propagation)  If an unsatisfied clause has all but one of its literals or variables evaluated at False, then the free literal must be True in order for the clause to be True. For example, if the below unsatisfied clause is evaluated with A = False and B = False we must have C = True in order for the clause (A \\\\lor B \\\\lor C ) to be true.  Boolean constraint propagation (BCP)  The iterated application of the unit clause rule is referred to as unit propagation or Boolean constraint propagation (BCP).  Resolution  Consider two clauses (A \\\\lor B \\\\lor C ) and ( eg C \\\\lor D \\\\lor eg E). The clause (A \\\\lor B \\\\lor D \\\\lor eg E), obtained by merging the two clauses and removing both eg C and C, is called the resolvent of the two clauses.  DP algorithm  The DP algorithm has been introduced by Davis and Putnam in 1960. Informally, the algorithm iteratively performs the following steps until no more variables are left in the formula: * Select a variable A and add all non-tautological resolvents upon A (a resolvent is non-tautological if it does not contain V and eg V for some variable V). * Remove all original clauses that contain A. Resolution of caluses  DPLL algorithm  Davis, Putnam, Logemann, Loveland (1962) had developed this algorithm. Some properties of this algorithms are: * It is based on search. * It is the basis for almost all modern SAT solvers. * It uses chronological backtracking, without learning. An example with visualization of DPLL algorithm having chronological backtracking: File:Dpll1.pngAll clauses making a CNF formula File:Dpll2.pngPick a variable File:Dpll3.pngMake a decision, variable a = False (0), thus green clauses becomes True File:Dpll4.pngAfter several decision making, we find an implication graph that leads to a conflict. File:Dpll5.pngNow backtrack to immediate level and by force assign opposite value to that variable File:Dpll6.pngBut a forced decision still leads to another conflict File:Dpll7.pngBacktrack to previous level and make a forced decision File:Dpll8.pngMake a new decision, but it leads to a conflict File:Dpll9.pngMake a forced decision, but again it leads to a conflict File:Dpll10.pngBacktrack to previous level File:Dpll11.pngContinue in this way and the final implication graph  CDCL (conflict-driven clause learning)  The main difference between CDCL and DPLL is that CDCL's back jumping is non-chronological. Conflict-driven clause learning works as follows. # Select a variable and assign True or False. This is called decision state. Remember the assignment. # Apply Boolean constraint propagation (unit propagation). # Build the implication graph. # If there is any conflict ## Find the cut in the implication graph that led to the conflict ## Derive a new clause which is the negation of the assignments that led to the conflict ## Non-chronologically backtrack (\\"back jump\\") to the appropriate decision level, where the first- assigned variable involved in the conflict was assigned # Otherwise continue from step 1 until all variable values are assigned.  Example  A visual example of CDCL algorithm: File:Cdcl1.png At first pick a branching variable, namely x1. A yellow circle means an arbitrary decision. File:Cdcl2.png Now apply unit propagation, which yields that x4 must be 1 (i.e. True). A gray circle means a forced variable assignment during unit propagation. The resulting graph is called an implication graph. File:Cdcl3.png Arbitrarily pick another branching variable, x3. File:Cdcl4.png Apply unit propagation and find the new implication graph. File:Cdcl5.png Here the variable x8 and x12 are forced to be 0 and 1, respectively. File:Cdcl6.png Pick another branching variable, x2. File:Cdcl7.png Find implication graph. File:Cdcl8.pngPick another branching variable, x7. File:Cdcl9.png Find implication graph. File:Cdcl10.png Found a conflict! File:Cdcl11.png Find the cut that led to this conflict. From the cut, find a conflicting condition. File:Cdcl12.png Take the negation of this condition and make it a clause. File:Cdcl13.png Add the conflict clause to the problem. File:Cdcl14.png Non-chronological back jump to appropriate decision level, which in this case is the second highest decision level of the literals in the learned clause. File:Cdcl15.png Back jump and set variable values accordingly.  Completeness  DPLL is a sound and complete algorithm for SAT. CDCL SAT solvers implement DPLL, but can learn new clauses and backtrack non-chronologically. Clause learning with conflict analysis does not affect soundness or completeness. Conflict analysis identifies new clauses using the resolution operation. Therefore, each learnt clause can be inferred from the original clauses and other learnt clauses by a sequence of resolution steps. If cN is the new learnt clause, then œï is satisfiable if and only if œï ‚à™ {cN} is also satisfiable. Moreover, the modified backtracking step also does not affect soundness or completeness, since backtracking information is obtained from each new learnt clause.  Applications  The main application of CDCL algorithm is in different SAT solvers including: * MiniSAT * Zchaff SAT * Z3 * ManySAT etc. The CDCL algorithm has made SAT solvers so powerful that they are being used effectively in several real world application areas like AI planning, bioinformatics, software test pattern generation, software package dependencies, hardware and software model checking, and cryptography.  Related algorithms  Related algorithms to CDCL are the DP and DPLL algorithm described before. The DP algorithm uses resolution refutation and it has potential memory access problem. Whereas the DPLL algorithm is OK for randomly generated instances, it is bad for instances generated in practical applications. CDCL is a more powerful approach to solve such problems in that applying CDCL provides less state space search in comparison to DPLL.

Kades played a central role in creating GHQ's draft of the Japanese constitution, and profoundly affected the direction of Japan following the war.  Early life  Kades was born to Jewish parents in Newburgh, New York. After graduating from Cornell University in 1927 and Harvard Law School in 1930, Kades worked at the Manhattan law firm of Hawkins, Delafield, and Longfellow as a municipal bond lawyer. From 1933-1942, Kades helped implement New Deal policies as the Assistant General Counsel for the Public Works Administration and then the United States Department of Treasury.  World War II, the Allied occupation of Japan, and revising the Japanese constitution  An Army reservist since 1924, Kades entered active military duty with the US Army in 1942. After service in the Army Civil Affairs Division in Washington, he participated in the U.S. D-Day landing in Southern France in August, 1944.http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/amherst/ma214.html Ten days after being promoted to the rank of colonel, Kades went to Japan as a member of the occupation forces on August 25, 1945. Although originally serving as the chief of GHQ's Government Section, Kades became deputy chief following the arrival of the new chief, Major General Courtney Whitney, in December, 1946.Kades, Charles L. 1989. \\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 220. As deputy chief, Kades was ordered by Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) Douglas MacArthur to chair GHQ's Steering Committee on revising Japan's constitution.  Order to revise the constitution and committee formation  According to Kades, he was first informed of MacArthur's order for the Government Section to revise the Japanese constitution on February 3, 1946. Having concluded that the constitutional \\"revisions\\" presented by the Japanese the previous day were unacceptable, MacArthur decided that a \\"model\\" constitution was needed. These orders were given to Whitney, who then conveyed them to Kades along with notes in pencil dictating the following three principles that would shape the draft: 1\\\\. The Emperor is the head of state, his succession is dynastic, and his duties and powers are subject to the constitution and the people's will. 2\\\\. Japan renounces the right to war, and shall maintain no army, navy, or air force. 3\\\\. The Japanese feudal system is abolished, and all rights of peerage and nobility will be replaced with a system based on the British Parliament.Kades, Charles L. 1989. \\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 222-224. Upon receiving these orders, Kades became part of the three- man Steering Committee who would lead the drafting process. Kades, along with Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hays and Commander Alfred Hussey, decided to split the Government Section into seven committees that would each work on different sections of the constitution. Whitney accepted this idea, and announced it to Government Section on February 4, 1946 with orders to keep the project top secret. He gave the Government Section one week to complete the drafting process.Kades, Charles L. 1989. \\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 225-226.  The drafting process  According to Kades, \\"the Steering Committee charged each committee with the responsibility of conforming its draft to the general principles set forth in a State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee's statement of policy entitled 'Reform of the Japanese Governmental System' (SWNCC 228),\\" and also to \\"...follow the format of the Meiji Constitution as closely as would be consistent with the changes each committee would recommend.\\"Kades, Charles L. 1989.\\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 226. Although the drafting process was completely controlled by Americans, the drafters did not simply import the American constitution, nor did they create a completely new constitution either. According to Kades, \\"Japanese sources were most useful. Used to good advantage were outlines of draft constitutions that had been published by the [Japanese]Progressive, Liberal, and Socialist Parties.Kades, Charles L. 1989.\\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 227. 356 The drafters also referred to constitutions from approximately twelve other countries that were obtained by Beate Sirota and Lieutenant Milton Esman,Gordon, Beate Sirota. 1997. The Only Woman in the Room. New York: Kodansha International Ltd. 107 and Kades encouraged drafters to also consult the Meiji Constitution of 1889.Gordon, Beate Sirota. 1997. The Only Woman in the Room. New York: Kodansha International Ltd.109 More specifically the drafters drew on the model Constitution presented by the Constitution Research Society headed by Yasuz≈ç Suzuki, which had been translated into English in December 1945. Furthermore, the Article renouncing war was suggested to General Douglas MacArthur by the then Japanese Prime Minister, Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara, who was known for his peace diplomacy in the interwar period when he was Foreign Minister. From February 4 to February 7, each committee prepared and submitted their respective draft to the Steering Committee for advice on revision. After meeting with each committee on February 8 and 9, the Steering Committee submitted a consolidated draft to General Whitney on February 10 consisting of thirty-three articles.Gordon, Beate Sirota. 1997. The Only Woman in the Room. New York: Kodansha International Ltd.103-118 MacArthur received this draft from Whitney the same day and approved it on February 11, making only one change. On February 12, the draft underwent final changes by the Steering Committee and members of the various Government Section committees, was again submitted to MacArthur via Whitney, and approved that night for submission to Japanese officials.  Submitting the GHQ draft and the marathon drafting session  On February 13, 1946 Whitney and the Steering Committee members presented four copies of the completed GHQ draft to Foreign Minister Shigeru Yoshida, Minister without portfolio charged with studying the new constitution J≈çji Matsumoto, Foreign ministry interpreter Genkichi Hasegawa, and Yoshida's aid Jir≈ç Shirasu. Whitney explained to these Cabinet members that their draft submitted on February 2 was wholly unacceptable and that a draft more acceptable to the supreme commander had been prepared for them. The Americans then moved to the garden of the residence and waited for about one hour as the Japanese officials read the draft. Yoshida explained that he could not comment on this draft before consulting with Prime Minister Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara, to which Whitney replied that passing the draft was in the government's best interest and the four Americans left.Kades, Charles L. 1989.\\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 228. After this meeting, the Japanese Cabinet replied with letters explaining that the American draft was too direct and contained ideas that would not work in Japan. Whitney reiterated the drafts benefits and explained that SCAP was prepared to present its draft to the Japanese people directly should the Cabinet refuse it.Kades, Charles L. 1989.\\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 231. At 10:00 AM on March 4, 1946, Japanese Cabinet officials delivered a new draft based on GHQ's to SCAP headquarters. Whitney, the Steering Committee and translators/interpreters for GHQ immediately met with these Cabinet members to translate and discuss the draft. Japanese officials had removed and/or altered many ideas, such as popular sovereignty, which Kades insisted was unacceptable.Gordon, Beate Sirota. 1997. The Only Woman in the Room. New York: Kodansha International Ltd.122 The two groups argued about these changes until Matsumoto left the meeting and relinquished responsibility to Tatsuo Sat≈ç and the remaining officials. At this point, it was decided that no one else could leave until a draft acceptable to both groups was completed. The two groups continued to argue about both the meaning of words and the inclusion of certain amendments. Negotiations continued until the evening of March 5, completing a thirty-two- hour drafting session. This new draft was submitted to MacArthur immediately, who then approved it later that night. The Japanese published a translated outline the following day, and MacArthur publicly endorsed it.Kades, Charles L. 1989.\\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 232-233.  Constitutional debate in the Japanese government and adoption of a new constitution  Following the elections of 1946, a special committee was appointed to study SCAP's draft, which had been presented as Japanese product. The draft was debated and amended, both directly by Japanese lawmakers and indirectly through SCAP, until being put up for a vote.Kades, Charles L. 1989.\\"The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution.\\" Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 235-241. The constitution, which had undergone approximately thirty revisions by Japanese lawmakers, was adopted on October 7, 1946 by a vote of 421 to 8 in the House of Representatives and a vote of over 300 to 2 in the House of Peers. Emperor Hirohito announced the promulgation of this new constitution on November 3, 1946 and the constitution became effective on May 3, 1947. 392-401  Controversy involving Kades  A famous episode in Kades' life involved an affair with Torio Tsuruyo. Following Kades' participation in purging bureaucrats from the Ministry of Home Affairs, National Rural Police Director Noboru Sait≈ç, along with former ministry bureaucrats, supported G2 (GHQ's intelligence section) in an attempt to oust Kades. However, Kades learned of this plot through Lady Tsuruyo Torio, and had leaders of the police headquarters demoted. In addition, some believe that Kades, in order to disguise his motivations, distorted the truth and forced a special investigations unit of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office to form a case against this group on charges of bureaucratic corruption.„ÄéÊîøÂÆòÊîªÈò≤Âè≤„ÄèÔºàÈáëÂ≠ê‰ªÅÊ¥ã, ÊñáÊò•Êñ∞Êõ∏, 1999Âπ¥  Military retirement and post-war life  On May 3, 1949 Kades resigned as deputy chief of the Government Section, choosing to leave Japan exactly two years from the day the Japanese constitution was adopted. Kades then returned to New York, where he worked as a lawyer until retiring in 1976. He died in 1996 at the age of 90. In 1948 he married Australian actress (Helen) Patricia Minchin (\\"Miss Sydney 1931\\"). It was a second marriage for both of them. They lived at Dobbs Ferry, NY, with two children from her first marriage. She left him in 1959 to return to Sydney with their daughter Caroline (born 1954) and they were divorced. She won custody of Caroline after protracted court proceedings. Kades later married again, as did Patricia. She died in 2002 aged 92.Dorothy Minchin-Comm The Book of Minchin Trafford, 2006 pp 489-491. See also 'Ramsay, Helen Patricia' at Obituaries Australia http://oa.anu.edu.au/.

Neu? name by Captain Trip Records. In most senses it is a Klaus Dinger solo album, as Dinger composed, produced, recorded and (mostly) performed the entire album alone. It was originally intended for release as the fifth La D√ºsseldorf album in 1987, but Dinger's contract with Virgin Records was terminated before the album's release. The 1987 rejection letter from Udo Lange is printed upside-down on the back cover of the CD. Name The ambiguity of the album's name and artist on the cover has caused confusion amongst retailers as well as fans. Whilst \\"La! Neu?\\" is prominently displayed at the top-right corner of the artwork, the cover also features the legend \\"La D√ºsseldorf 5\\", referring to Dinger's band from the 1970s and '80s. Some have confused this legend with the album title ‚Äì Blue ‚Äì or been confused by references in the album booklet to \\"Five Pearls and a Hammer\\" ‚Äì the album's original title. In fact, no members of La! Neu? or La D√ºsseldorf other than Dinger himself appear on the album, and the few extra musicians who do contribute come from Dinger's 1984 project N√©ondian. Some have argued that this makes the album ‚Äì in effect ‚Äì a Klaus Dinger solo album (like N√©ondian), but this is not referred to anywhere in the CD packaging. Background and recording The album was recorded over a period of three years spanning 1984, 1985 and 1986. The lengthy version of \\"America\\" which closes the album was recorded first, during the sessions for Neondian (which features a shorter, synthesizer-based version of the song). This is the only track on the album to feature instrumentalists other than Dinger; namely R√ºdiger \\"Spinello\\" Elze (of Kowalski) on guitar, Manfred \\"Charly\\" Therstappen on drums and Raoul Walton on bass (both of Belfegore). All three appeared on Neondian and Elze also contributed to the La! Neu? albums Year of the Tiger and Live at Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf. The track was recorded electronically at Dinger's studios in Kamperland, Netherlands. Some time after the original recording, Dinger added whispered lead vocals which are dubbed in and out throughout the track alongside the original sung lyrics. The album's first five tracks (originally planned to make up the A-side of an LP release) were recorded in 1985 and '86. \\"Arms Control Blues\\" is a spoken word track in which Dinger compares his idyllic life in Kamperland with the fraught negotiations between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev on nuclear arms control, at that time taking place in Geneva. The album's title track features Dinger's step-daughter Yvi Paas on vocals, a role she would reprise on Die Engel des Herrn. \\"Lilienthal\\" is an instrumental piece recorded in and named after Dinger's D√ºsseldorf studios, whilst \\"Touch You Tonight\\" is a short song influenced by The Rolling Stones. \\"F√ºr Omi\\" is an instrumental eulogy to Dinger's grandmother, who died during the recording of the album. Having mixed and mastered the album, in 1987 Dinger submitted the tape to his record company Virgin Records (where he had been moved following WMG's takeover of Teldec in 1986). Virgin were contracted to release one more Dinger album by an agreement made with Teldec in 1979. On 17 March he received a letter from Udo Lange ‚Äì head of Virgin in Germany ‚Äì declining to release the album: \\"If one is not one hundred-percent certain of a product, even in such favourable conditions, it should not be released\\".\\"Blue\\" CD back cover Dinger was thus dropped from WMG and forced to market his following album (Die Engel des Herrn) independently. The album was originally to be titled \\"Five Pearls and a Hammer\\" in reference to the six tracks; the first five being \\"pearls\\" and \\"America\\" being \\"a hammer\\". By 1999 Dinger's relationship with Captain Trip Records, Tokyo allowed him to release many CDs relatively cheaply, and after meeting up with Spinello Elze in 1998 for the first time in years he decided to release Blue. He dedicated the album to Marion Paas, his partner since the early 1980s and Yvi's mother, as well as to his grandmother and parents. The CD booklet features photographs of Dinger and his family in Zeeland in the 1980s, including one of Dinger, Yvi and Marion on the beach which Dinger found being sold as a tourist postcard. Significantly, the booklet features the first contribution of Masaki Nakao to a Dinger album (a drawing of the Japanese symbol \\"Ai\\"). Nakao, who met Dinger in 1998, would be a major collaborator throughout the following decade before Dinger's death in 2008.

In reality, N√©ondian was a solo album for Klaus Dinger, and Mon Amour in effect his debut (and only) solo single. It was also the first Dinger recording to be released on CD, and the last single Dinger would release in his lifetime. Recording & Release After the abandonment of the third La D√ºsseldorf album \\"Mon Amour\\", Dinger worked much of the material into a solo album, released on Teldec under the pseudonym Klaus Dinger + Rheinita Bella D√ºsseldorf (hinting at La D√ºsseldorf's most successful single - Rheinita). Dinger recorded the album alone in his Zeeland Studios using synthesizers before asking for the help of Conny Plank, who had produced La D√ºsseldorf's debut album in 1976. Plank oversaw the overdubbing of Dinger's basic tracks by studio musicians (including members of Belfegore and Jaki Liebezeit). \\"Mon Amour\\" was chosen as the lead single and released on CD and vinyl in September 1985. It failed to chart, and in 1986 was deleted from Teldec's catalogue along with N√©ondian and all La D√ºsseldorf releases, upon the label's acquirement by WMG.

The company was founded in 2009 by Mike Lindell, who invented and patented My Pillow, an open-cell, poly-foam pillow design. From 2004 to 2009, My Pillows were sold through Lindell‚Äôs Night Moves Minnesota, LLC and have been sold through My Pillow, Inc. since 2009. My Pillow has sold over 41 million pillows, due mostly to TV infomercials. The company started with five employees in 2004 and had 1,500 employees as of 2017.John Vomhof Jr., \\"My Pillow soars after informercial,\\" Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal, June 22, 2012.  History   Origin  My Pillow was founded by Mike Lindell, a resident of the U.S. state of Minnesota. To help fund the development of the pillow, Lindell sold four bars he owned in Carver County, Minnesota, and mortgaged his own house. At first, Lindell hand-sewed the pillows himself and handled all the sales and distribution with help from his family. The first My Pillow was sold in 2005 at a kiosk in Eden Prairie Center, a mall in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. For the next six years, the company struggled while selling at mall kiosks, state fairs, and trade shows.  Promotion  The company's success took off after launching an infomercial in October 2011.Sam Black, \\"My Pillow moving 200 jobs to Shakopee, opening retail stores,\\" Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal, August 23, 2012. The thirty- minute show was shot in one day in front of a live studio audience and cost $500,000 to produce and launch.John Ewoldt, \\"Sales stay plump for Chanhassen- based MyPillow,\\" Star Tribune, September 15, 2013. As of September 2013, the infomercial was still running an average of 200 times per day on local and national networks. Since it first aired, My Pillow has sold more than 30 million pillows and grown from 50 employees to over 1,500.\\"The Man Behind The Passion Of MyPillow,\\" CBS Minnesota, December 25, 2013. In July 2015, Lindell and My Pillow sponsored an attempt to set a new Guinness World Record for the world's largest pillow fight at a St. Paul Saints baseball game. The fight featured 6,261 participants, beating a previous record of 4,201. In May 2018, Lindell and My Pillow again broke the Guinness World Record for the world's largest pillow fight, this time at the evangelistic PULSE Movement event held at the U.S. Bank Stadium, after Lindell led over 45,000 people in prayer. In late March 2018, student activists from the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, including David Hogg, called for a boycott of advertisers on the television show The Ingraham Angle on Fox News Channel, after host Laura Ingraham made disparaging comments about Hogg. Dozens of advertisers subsequently vowed to no longer pay for advertising on The Ingraham Angle, but My Pillow continued to advertise on the show and increased their advertising buy on The Ingraham Angle by 625% during the first week in April 2018. My Pillow spent more money advertising on the Fox News Tucker Carlson Tonight program than any other advertiser as of June 2020, after many major companies stopped supporting the show. A data firm estimated that nearly 38% of Carlson's 2020 advertising revenue had come from My Pillow at half-year.  Operations  The company's headquarters, call center and customer service center are located in Chaska, Minnesota. My Pillow manufactures pillows, mattresses, mattress toppers and covers, Giza Cotton sheets, towels and pet beds at its 70,000 square-foot manufacturing plant in Shakopee, producing approximately 25,000 pillows per day.\\"'My Pillow' founder opens up about addiction,\\" Salvation Army Website, December 29, 2015.

My Pillow products are also offered on QVC, at major retailers, trade shows, and from the My Pillow website. Covid-19 pandemic production shift In March 2020, FOX News reported that founder Mike Lindell had announced that 75% of the company's production was shifting to making cotton face masks to donate to health care workers for use during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that \\"Masks will not be available to public to purchase\\", though the cotton masks later appeared for sale on the My Pillow website.  Design and technology  My Pillow products are a patented design, involving a mix of different-sized pieces of open-cell poly-foam. Lindell claims to have tested 94 different foams before deciding on the right one. The pieces are chopped to specification by a machine Lindell developed based on a piece of farm equipment. The mix also contains a resin that enables the foam to retain much of its shape when molded to the user's preference. The pillows are non-allergenic, dust mite-resistant, washable, and dryable. In 2013, QVC awarded My Pillow its Q-Star Award for Product Concept of the Year.Nichole Dobo, \\"Pillow business earns QVC award,\\" The News Journal, February 20, 2014.  Lawsuits and settlement  In April 2016, a class action lawsuit was proposed for the pillows being falsely advertised, among the complaints being that Lindell is marketed as a \\"Sleep Expert,\\" despite having no board certification or special training in sleep medicine. The Better Business Bureau received 220 complaints regarding the company from 2013‚Äì2016. In August 2016, the New York State Attorney General's office charged that My Pillow failed to collect and remit over $500,000 in sales tax. The company denied any wrongdoing and agreed to pay $1.1 million in settlement.Farrell, Mary H.J., \\"My Pillow Settles Consumer Lawsuit Over Health Claims for $1 Million\\", Consumer Reports, November 03, 2016 On November 1, 2016, My Pillow agreed to pay $1 million ($995,000 in civil penalties and $100,000 to California charities benefiting the homeless and victims of domestic violence) to settle a false advertising lawsuit brought in Alameda County Superior Court by Alameda County and eight other California counties. The lawsuit challenged the company's marketing claims, which asserted without proof that its pillows could treat symptoms of fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, sleep apnea, cerebral palsy, acid reflux, and other conditions. As part of the settlement, the company was banned \\"from making claims in California that its pillows can cure or treat diseases and their symptoms without a human trial to back up the statements.\\" \\"In addition, My Pillow must stop promoting itself as the 'official pillow' of the National Sleep Foundation because it failed to disclose its financial connection with the foundation to consumers.\\" In November 2017, the lawsuit, which challenged the appropriateness of the marketing, packaging, and sale of My Pillow products, including health claims about the product, buy one get one promotions, and the use of third party endorsements and logos, was settled.  Ratings and reviews  In January 2017, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) announced it had revoked the accreditation for My Pillow and had lowered their rating from an A+ to an F based upon numerous consumer complaints. The main issue addressed by the BBB was the constant use of their buy one, get one free offer. The BBB's Code of Advertising requires that offers or discounts must be made for a limited time, or the deal becomes the normal price of the product. It remained an active promotion, as of August 2020. A 2016 Consumer Reports review of the company's pillows found a mixed reception after at-home testing, finding that \\"only one- third of the group said they would buy MyPillow again.\\"  Philanthropy  A portion of My Pillow proceeds goes to the Lindell Foundation, a charity that assists addicts, veterans, cancer patients, and other people in need.J.W. Najarian, \\"MyPillow and Orange County Choppers Unveil Custom Motorcycle at Mall of America,\\" On Purpose Magazine, April 6, 2012. In March 2015, My Pillow donated pillows to the Sandra J. Schulze American Cancer Society Hope Lodge, which houses patients and their caregivers when traveling for treatment. As of 2017, the company was donating a pillow to charities such as homeless shelters and hospitals for each order made in the associated Minnesota community.

It was founded in 1919. When it was revived in 1945, it was sometimes also called Neue Darmst√§dter Sezession (New Darmstadt Secession).  History  In 1919 a circle of artists and friends in Darmstadt felt the need to create a spiritual center. The association known as the Secession was founded on 8 June 1919 by 21 people including Max Beckmann and Ludwig Meidner. The first Secession catalogue stated \\"Darmstadt feels strong enough to rise from artistic province to artistic capital again, from a metropolis of spiritual reaction to a center of new spiritual values.\\"Darmstadt f√ºhlt sich stark genug, aus k√ºnstlerischer Provinz wieder k√ºnstlerische Hauptstadt zu werden; aus einer Metropole geistiger Reaktion ein Mittelpunkt neuer geistiger Werterzeugung. The exhibition \\"Deutscher Expressionismus Darmstadt 1920\\" (German Expressionism Darmstadt 1920) was of national importance. Besides works by Expressionists it also showed the art of Cubists, Dadaists, Constructivists and representatives of Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity). Some of the subsequent exhibitions caused scandals, such as \\"Deutsche Kunst Darmstadt 1923\\" (German Art Darmstadt 1923) and in 1929 \\"Der sch√∂ne Mensch in der neuen Kunst\\" (Beautiful Man in the New Art). When the Nazis came to power in 1933, some of the members of the Secession went into \\"internal exile\\", and others emigrated. Still others joined the resistance against the regime. After the war the Secession was founded again in the autumn of 1945, assuming that it had been banned, but no evidence of a ban has been found so far. In 1954 the first photographer, Otto Steinert, was accepted. Today the association has more than 100 members in Germany, more than 20% of them in Berlin. Speakers of the board as of 2007 are Barbara Bredow and Horst D. B√ºrkle.  Annual show and Prize for Young Artists  The Secession organises an annual exhibition in the fields of painting, graphics, sculpture and photography at the Darmstadt Mathildenh√∂he, as well as various special exhibitions. Since 1975, a biennial prize has been awarded to young artists, funded by the HSE Foundation and the city of Darmstadt.

The devices behind the NAT use private IP addresses that are not routable in the public Internet. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has established itself as the de facto standard for voice over IP (VoIP) communication.Sinnreich, Henry; Johnston, Alan B. (2001), Internet Communication Using SIP, Wiley, p. 180, In order to establish a call, a caller sends a SIP message, which contains its own IP address. The callee is supposed to reply back with a SIP message destined to the IP addresses included in the received SIP message. This will obviously not work if the caller is behind a NAT and is using a private IP address. Probably the single biggest mistake in SIP design was ignoring the existence of NATs. This error came from a belief in IETF leadership that IP address space would be exhausted more rapidly and would necessitate global upgrade to IPv6 and eliminate the need for NATs. The SIP standard has assumed that NATs do not exist, an assumption, which turned out to be a failure. SIP simply didn't work for the majority of Internet users who are behind NATs. At the same time it became apparent that the standardization life-cycle is slower than how the market ticks: Session Border Controllers (SBC) were born, and began to fix what the standards failed to do: NAT traversal. In case a user agent is located behind a NAT then it will use a private IP address as its contact address in the contact and via headers as well as the SDP part. This information would then be useless for anyone trying to contact this user agent from the public Internet. There are different NAT traversal solutions such as STUN, TURN and ICE.Rosenberg, J. (April 2010). Interactive connectivity establishment (ICE): a protocol for network address translator (NAT) traversal for offer/answer protocols. IETF. RFC 5245 Which solution to use depends on the behavior of the NAT and the call scenario. When using an SBC to solve the NAT traversal issues the most common approach for SBC is to act as the public interface of the user agents.Hautakorpi, J.; Camarillo, G.; Penfield, R.; Hawrylyshen, A.; Bhatia, M. (April 2010). Requirements from SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Session Border Control Deployments. IETF. RFC 5853 This is achieved by replacing the user agent's contact information with those of the SBC.  SBC handling of user registration and NAT traversal  NAT traversal handling with SBC during call establishment In order for a user agent to be reachable through the public interfaces of an SBC, the SBC will manipulate the registration information of the user agent. The user includes its private IP address as its contact information in the REGISTER requests. Calls to this address will fail, since it is not publicly routable. The SBC replaces the information in the contact header with its own IP address. This is the information that is then registered at the registrar. Calls destined to the user will then be directed to the SBC. In order for the SBC to know which user agent is actually being contacted the SBC can keep a local copy of the user agent's registration. The local copy includes the private IP address and the user's SIP URI as well as the public IP address included in the IP header that was assigned to the SIP message by the NAT. Alternatively the SBC can store this information in the forwarded SIP messages. This is displayed in the figure here. The user's contact information is combined in a special format and added as an additional parameter to the contact header. The contact information include the user's private IP address and SIP URI as well as the public IP address in the IP header of the SIP message. When the registrar receives a request for the user, the registrar will return the complete contact information to the proxy, which will include this information in the SIP message. The SBC can then retrieve this information from the SIP request and use it to properly route the request to the user. Adding the user agent's contact information to the registered contact information has many advantages. As the SBC does not have to keep local registration information this solution is simple to implement and does not require memory for keeping the information. Further, requests destined to the user agent do not necessarily have to traverse the SBC that has processed the user agent's registration messages. Any SBC that can reach the user agent can correctly route messages destined to the user agent based on the information included in the SIP request. This advantage applies, however, only in some cases. In case the NAT used in front of the user agent accepts traffic only from the IP addresses which the user agent has contacted previously then only the SBC that has processed the user agent's REGISTER requests will be able to contact the user agent. The other option is to keep a local copy of the registration information which can, however, increase the processing requirements on the SBC. The SBC will have to manage a local registration database. Beside the memory requirements the SBC will have to replicate this information to a backup system if it is to be highly available. This will further increase the processing requirements on the SBC and increase the bandwidth consumption. However, keeping a local copy of the registration information has its advantages as well. When receiving a message from a user agent a network address translator binds the private IP address of the user agent to a public IP address. This binding will remain active for a period of time ‚Äìbinding period. In case the user agent does not send or receive any messages for a period of time longer than the binding period then the NAT will delete the binding and the user agent will no longer be reachable from the outside. To keep the binding active, the user agent will have to regularly refresh it. This is achieved by sending REGISTER requests at time intervals shorter than the binding period. As REGISTER messages have to be usually authenticated, having to deal with REGISTER messages sent at a high frequency would impose a high performance hit on the operator's infrastructure. SBCs can help to offload this load. When a user agent sends the first REGISTER request, the SBC forwards the REGISTER request to the operator's registration servers. Once the registration was successfully authenticated and accepted by the operator, the SBC will keep a local copy of the registration information. Instead of forwarding each incoming REGIETER request to the operator's registration servers, the SBC will only send REGISTER requests to the registration servers at rather large time intervals (in the range of hours). Registration requests arriving from the user agent that do not change the content registration information will be replied to by the SBC itself. The SBC will also inform the registration server once the local registration expires or changes.  SBC handling of call establishment and NAT traversal  NAT traversal with SBC during user registration Similar to the registration case, the SBC will also include itself in the path of INVITE and other request messages. When receiving an INVITE from a user agent behind a NAT, the SBC will include a via header with its own address, replace the information in the contact header with its own address and also replace the address information in the SDP body with its own address. Thereby, all SIP messages and media packets will traverse the SBC.  SBC handling of media packets and NAT traversal  After the establishment of a call using SIP, media packets, namely voice, video or data are exchanged -usually using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) While NAT traversal of SIP messages may appear complicated after all, the yet more complex task is enabling media to traverse NATs. The initial problem statement is the same. If SIP devices behind NATs advertise their IP addresses, their peers on the other side of NATs cannot route traffic to them. The solution SBCs came with simply ignores the way SIP works. Instead of sending media to the IP address and port number advertised in the SIP SDP bodies, SBCs send media for a user agent symmetrically back to where the agent has sent its own media from. This symmetric communication typically works because it is the traffic pattern NAT manufactures have been used to before the arrival of VoIP. It is important to know that while this mostly works, it has several limitations. First of all, it only works with clients that are built \\"symmetric way\\", i.e., they use the same port for sending and receiving media. Nowadays that's fortunately the majority of available equipment. The other noticeable disadvantage is \\"triangular routing\\": an SBC must relay all VoIP traffic for a call, to make the paths caller-SBC and SBC-callee symmetric. That is in fact quite an overhead for a VoIP operator. With the most common codec, G.711, a relayed call consumes four 87.2 kbit/s streams: two outbound, two inbound. Some other disturbing limitations may occur too. For example, if a SIP device uses voice activity detection (VAD) and fails to send any voice packets initially, the SBC will not learn its address and will not forward incoming media to it as well.

Plot While investigating the scene of a gruesome mass murder at Beacon Mental Hospital, Krimson City police detective Sebastian Castellanos (Anson Mount), his partner Joseph Oda (Yuri Lowenthal), and Junior Detective Juli Kidman (Jennifer Carpenter) find themselves suddenly thrown into an unreal world, after hearing a high-pitched noise. Shortly after this occurs, Sebastian is separated from his partners and is forced to flee from a monstrous man wielding a chainsaw. Upon reuniting with his colleagues, they attempt to escape via ambulance while Krimson City is destroyed and rearranged by a massive earthquake, eventually causing them to crash. Freeing himself from the wreckage, Sebastian wanders through unnatural forests and abandoned buildings full of monstrous creatures, and witnesses the apparition of a disfigured man in a white hood. Trapped in the nightmare world, Sebastian encounters one of Beacon's doctors, Marcelo Jimenez (Daniel Riordan), who is searching for his patient, Leslie Withers (Aaron Landon). Jimenez identifies the hooded stranger stalking them as Ruvik (Jackie Earle Haley). Sebastian eventually reunites with Joseph, though it is shortly revealed that Joseph is suffering from a strange form of transformation which compels him into a murderous rage. While he is able to control it for the most part, Joseph warns Sebastian to be wary of him if he turns. The two eventually find and rescue Kidman from drowning in a crude contraption, though they are soon separated again after hearing the high pitched noise. Elsewhere, Kidman is being forced to relive memories of her indoctrination into an organization known as Mobius. It is revealed that Kidman is actually an undercover agent, sent by Mobius to retrieve Leslie from Jimenez, apparently as leverage to force Jimenez to continue working for them. Jimenez had been working with Mobius on a project known as STEM - a machine capable of uniting minds into one, with one influencing mind at its center. Jimenez activated STEM without Mobius' permission - signaled by the high-pitched noise - but Mobius anticipated this, and trained Kidman to navigate the STEM world and retrieve Leslie. Sebastian learns of the story of Ruvik, born Ruben Victoriano, through various memories that Ruvik places him in. Ruben was an intellectually gifted but mentally unstable child, and was close to his sister, Laura (Laura Post). While playing in a barn on their family's estate, Laura was killed and Ruben was severely burned after the barn was set on fire as an act of revenge against their parents. Due to his disfigurement from the fire, Ruben's father hid him in the basement of the family manor. Deeply traumatized over Laura's death, Ruben eventually killed both of his parents, took control of their fortune, and continued to \\"donate\\" money to Beacon Mental Hospital in exchange for test subjects for his experiments into the human psyche. Ruvik began designing STEM as a means for him to reshape reality, so that he could physically travel back into his memories and live his life again with Laura. Jimenez then took notice of Ruvik's work, and revealed it to Mobius, who wished to use it for their own purposes. As a safety measure, Ruvik calibrated STEM to work with only his brain as the core. In retaliation, Mobius simply killed him and extracted his brain for installation in order to use the machine, thus allowing Ruvik to maintain control of the STEM world. Kidman realizes that Mobius in fact wants the meek Leslie as a replacement for Ruvik's brain - an easily manipulated 'blank slate' mind, which they can use to power STEM and create a world of their own design. When Jimenez, aided by Sebastian, tries to use Leslie to return to reality, he realizes that Ruvik wants to transfer his mind to a compatible host, and escape into the real world. A beast created from Ruvik's subconscious kills Jimenez, and Ruvik scatters the group across his mind. Kidman finds Leslie first, and is about to shoot him to prevent Ruvik from using him as a host, when Sebastian and Joseph intervene, prompting her to shoot Joseph, before Ruvik separates them again. Kidman tries desperately to turn against Mobius, but realizes that she has been given a serum which has allowed Mobius to travel into the STEM world with her. Sebastian finds Leslie, and guides him back to the hospital. At the top of the lighthouse, he sees his own body in a bathtub hooked to the STEM machine. Kidman arrives and attempts to convince Sebastian that Leslie has to die. Ruvik interrupts them, gets hold of Leslie, and absorbs him. Sebastian battles a gigantic creature created from Ruvik's subconscious and defeats it, waking up in the bathtub. He pulls himself off the machine, removes Ruvik's brain from the STEM, and crushes it. He wakes up in the tub again with Kidman by his side, monitoring him and Joseph, who is unconscious in a second tub next to him; Kidman motions for Sebastian to stay quiet. Sebastian falls unconscious, and later wakes up in the same tub, with no one around except for the bodies of Jimenez and Connelly. As police and S.W.A.T. reinforcements arrive, Sebastian exits the hospital and notices Leslie walking out of the main gates. Sebastian has a brief headache ‚Äî a sign of Ruvik's influence on subjects within the STEM ‚Äî which causes him to lose sight of Leslie. It is implied that Ruvik has returned to the real world, and is able to influence those who were connected to his machine, intending to take revenge on the organization that betrayed him. The Assignment and The Consequence A two-part DLC set before and during the events of the main game, it revolves around Juli Kidman's mission of retrieving Leslie from the STEM. Entering the machine, Kidman is attacked by Oscar Connelly (Kiff VandenHeuvel) while in the forest and falls off a cliff. She then hears Mobius talking to her, and attempts to use a keypad. Blocked out by the keypad, she is forced to find a way to get access, avoiding several creatures along the way. After being trapped by Ruvik and subsequently rescued by Sebastian and Joseph, she is separated from the former, while the latter turns into a Haunted and attacks Kidman. After she defeats him, the world changes and after getting past several obstacles, she finds Leslie and takes him to the church, only to be confronted by Ruvik who attacks Kidman through Leslie. She then learns that Ruvik can leave STEM through Leslie by overriding himself into Leslie's body, and he informs Kidman that Mobius has been keeping tabs on her as much as he once was. Kidman then tries to shoot Leslie, only for both to disappear, and a figure known as the Administrator (Rob Brownstein) begins talking to Kidman, demanding her to extract Leslie instead of killing him regardless, but Kidman refuses to complete the mission, warning him that they don't know what Ruvik is capable of. He then appears in front of her as a dark misty figure and pursues her until Kidman finally manages to escape him. Outside the church, she sees Beacon Mental Hospital in the distance, before its lighthouse blinds her. Waking up in the Safe Haven and meeting Tatiana Gutierrez (Julie Granata), Kidman explores the area before being able to leave. Ending up back at the Mobius headquarters, she decides to go the bottom floor to the STEM terminal because she thinks Leslie is heading there. Along the way she learns more about Ruvik's relationship with Mobius and the way they treated him. Reaching at the terminal, she's led back to Krimson City and goes through the police department, where she sees memories of Sebastian and Joseph and begins feeling sympathy for the former. Heading back towards Beacon Mental Hospital, she meets up with Sebastian who gets turned into a Haunted by Ruvik, but manages to save him and find Leslie. However, The Administrator chases her until she gets to a school bus and drives away, but Ruvik then telepathically launches the bus into the hotel. Kidman recovers and is separated from Sebastian and Joseph, losing her handgun in the process. Along the way, she encounters paintings of Ruvik that are trying to take control of Leslie. Kidman manages to save Leslie but he runs out of fear. Proceeding further, she finds more paintings trying to take control of Leslie. While trying to fend them off, hands of Laura burst from the ground and ensnare Kidman, and Leslie points a gun towards her, but he manages to resist Ruvik's control and shoots the painting, saving Kidman. Retrieving the handgun from Leslie, Kidman takes him along, hoping that this way he will be safe. Following this, a scene from the main game plays, but from Kidman's perspective, as she sees the Administrator instead of Sebastian, who informs that they know what Leslie will become and that Ruvik is a corpse. After Leslie's outburst, she pursues Leslie, but is brought back to Mobius HQ. Then, she goes through a door and is brought to Beacon, where she accesses other rooms and learns about Leslie's synchronization with Ruvik's brainwave due to his loss of family, and her being an expendable agent that could potentially neutralize Ruvik. Rushing through dozens of Haunted, Kidman is able to get in an elevator that leads up to the apex of Beacon where the Mobius facility is, as the Administrator taunts Kidman, explaining that STEM was built on the premise of fear as a way to control individuals, with the true purpose of her mission serving as a test run for the Administrator's new method of infused control. Having finally broken out of his influence, she eventually faces the Administrator, who makes a final attempt to end Kidman but is defeated, who then remarks how he'll always be a part of Kidman before being shot. Awakening in the real world, Kidman sees Leslie emerge from a STEM terminal and being taken away along with Joseph, as well as the vessel that housed Ruvik's brain now empty, much to her confusion. A woman then calls out to Kidman from behind, who is revealed as Myra (Tasia Valenza), Sebastian's wife. Myra says \\"he\\" will need a debriefing as soon as Kidman gets back. With no one watching her, Kidman frees Sebastian, and tells the Mobius members to leave Sebastian, Connelly, and Jimenez there, as they were not going anywhere. The Administrator's voice is heard as says that \\"No one is\\". Development The Evil Within began development in late 2010 under the codename \\"Project Zwei\\". Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami served as the game's director, with development taking place at his studio Tango Gameworks. The studio was bought by ZeniMax Media in 2010, shortly after development began. Mikami said that he wanted to make a survival horror game as he believed that contemporary horror games relied more on action than survival. The game was announced in April 2013. Believing that the tropes of the survival horror had become predictable over time, the design deliberately attempts to make the player feel powerless by taking place in confined spaces, limiting ammunition, and presenting near- invincible enemies that promote running and hiding over engaging in combat. Art director Naoki Katakai said that the design concept of enemies, such as those wrapped in barbed wire or filled with glass shards, is that they are victims suffering under a greater evil. The asylum itself was inspired by the Winchester Mystery House, a Californian mansion famous for its architectural curiosities. The Evil Within is built on the id Tech 5 modified by Tango Gameworks with a new dynamic renderer enabling dynamic lighting to the game. Tessellation is also added. On April 15, 2013, and over the next few days, Bethesda Softworks revealed a series of short cryptic videos teasing the new game, officially announcing it on April 19, 2013, revealing the title, the platforms it will be released on, and a live-action teaser trailer.

Release The Evil Within was released in October 2014. In Japan, the game was released as Psycho Break. The Japanese version had to remove gore-related content to receive a D-content rating (allowing its sale to customers 17 years of age or older) to avoid limiting its potential audience; this content can be restored via optional DLC. Warner Bros. Movie World in Queensland, Australia, created a maze populated with real-life characters from the game as part of its annual Fright Nights event to promote the game. Prior to the game's release, Titan Comics released a four-part mini series set before the events of the main game The Art of the Evil Within, a book collecting concept art and behind-the-scenes material from the game, was released by Dark Horse Comics alongside the game on October 14, 2014. The game also features downloadable content (DLC) missions which feature Juli Kidman and the enemy, the Keeper, as playable characters. A story-based campaign following Kidman was released as two separate DLC packs, which introduced new enemies, locations, and focus on unsolved mysteries from the main game. The first of the two DLCs, titled The Assignment was released on all platforms in March 2015 worldwide, while The Consequence followed later in April 2015. The final DLC content, The Executioner, follows the character called The Keeper through a series of mission-based levels with sadistic objectives.

Computer and Video Games (CVG) described it as \\"the game Resident Evil 5 should have been\\", although they were critical of some technical issues. VideoGamer.com liked the gunplay and horror, but disliked the story and its pacing, stating: \\"The Evil Within has enough magic to make it a worthy investment.\\" Destructoid said: \\"[The game] will definitely scratch the itch of someone who has been pining for a return to the older days of gaming, but everyone else who has come to expect that certain layer of polish likely won't be amused.\\" Polygon's Philip Kollar summed up his thoughts by saying: \\"The Evil Within has great moments where the excellent combat and creepy environmental design come together. But those moments are fleeting, inevitably sapped of their delightful terror by design choices that feel trapped in the glory days of a decade ago.\\" GamesRadar's Ashley Reed gave the game a 3.5/5, commending the game for providing innovation and a story that keeps the player involved. Even though she mostly liked the game, Reed had several criticisms, stating: \\"The Evil Within stumbles in a few too many places to be Mikami's magnum opus. It artificially forces players into punishing combat scenarios more times than can be ignored, and plots and themes with great promise end up sputtering out in disheartening fashion. Still, it would be wrong to dismiss all the things it does right. Between a gorefest that's thoroughly engrossing, amazing feelings of triumph created by the imposing difficulty, and a plot that gets to the core of some very unsettling themes, The Evil Within brings enough to the table that it deserves a taste.\\" Lucy O'Brien of IGN gave it a positive score of 8.7 out of 10 in her review of the game. She praised the gameplay and horror of the game, but criticized the boring protagonist, Sebastian, and the saggy and convoluted plot, stating that \\"while its story does end up buckling under its own ambition, there is little here that takes away from the joy of experiencing survival horror under the steady hands of a master of the craft.\\" Christopher Livingston from PC Gamer gave it a mixed review, praising the survival portions of the game, tense and often exciting atmosphere, satisfying stealth, exciting action sequences, as well as the nicely detailed environment, but criticizing the recycled, and very often, not scary bosses, poor character models, late texture pop-ins, sluggish control, frustrating camera angles, limited video options and poor decision on the aspect ratio. He stated that all these technical issues has dragged The Evil Within from enjoyably challenging to needlessly frustrating. Tim Turi from Game Informer praised its high replay value, jump scares, well-executed lighting, dark, unpredictable world, as well as the sounds of enemies, but criticizing the distracting texture pop-in and disappointing story. He summarized the game as \\"an unnerving experience that keep your palms sweaty while delivering a harrowingly rewarding gameplay trial.\\" Shaun McInnis of GameSpot spoke well of its striking atmosphere, tense combat that encourages resourcefulness, and rewarding skill progression system, but criticizing the nonsensical story and forgettable characters, autosave system, and a few frustrating boss fights. As the aspect ratio of the game received criticism, a patch was released on June 23, 2015 that allows players to play the game in full screen. Sales In Japan, the game sold 176,691 physical copies across all platforms, along with an estimated 4,138 digital copies. The Evil Within was the second best-selling game in the United Kingdom on the all-formats chart during the week of its release. In the United States, the game was the third best-selling game of October 2014. It set the record for the highest-selling first month of sales for a new survival horror intellectual property (IP), until the record was later broken by Dying Light, when it released in January 2015. Sequel At E3 2017, Bethesda revealed the trailer for a sequel, The Evil Within 2. The game takes place three years after the events of the original game and features Sebastian returning to STEM to look for Lily, his believed-to-be dead daughter. The game was released on October 13, 2017 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Last Chance Pack was announced as a pre-order bonus on July 19, 2017, it includes an exclusive handgun, some crafting items, and some healing items. It is similar to The Fighting Chance Pack from the first game.

A 2013 feature on The FADER website placed the Forest Swords project as a unique and contemporary strain of dub music, \\"worth endless listens, endless re-examinations, endless re- contextualizing\\", and stating it \\"exists in that sweet spot of musical influence between everything and nothing.\\"  Original composition and scoring work  In 2014 Barnes was commissioned to produce the trailer music for Ubisoft's video game title Assassin's Creed Rogue.

History  Beginning as a collaboration between members of several notable 1990s rock bands, Pullman was formed in mid- to late 1997. The project stemmed from conversations between Ken Brown and Curtis Harvey during the recording sessions for Loftus' homonymous debut album and Rex's 1996 sophomore album C. Ken Brown, ex-member of Tortoise and Gastr Del Sol, and Curtis Harvey, from Rex and The Curtis Harvey Band, were joined by Codeine drummer and Come guitarist Chris Brokaw and Eleventh Dream Day bassist Doug McCombs. The project is an amalgam between band and collective, a vessel -as its name indicates- for its members to release acoustic music that did not fit their other musical ventures, as evidenced by the fact that individual members had compositions suitable for Pullman dating back to 1993. In addition to this, the members of Pullman have also collaborated on certain songs, composing them as a band. For the recording of their second album, Viewfinder, the band was joined by drummer Tim Barnes, who has performed and worked by such acts such as The Tower Recordings, Jim O‚ÄôRourke, Silver Jews, and Nagisa Ni Te. Both albums, as Andy Kellman -writing in Allmusic- states, \\"were conceived in the spirit of the group's favorite acoustic guitarists, including Nick Drake, Leo Kottke, John Fahey, Ry Cooder, and Richard Thompson.\\" Due to the band members' busy schedule and the fact that they resided in number of different cities -Chicago, New York City, Boston-, Pullman remained a studio-only project, leading to particularly short promotional tours which resulted in the band's semi-obscure status, best encapsulated in the epithetic manner in which Hot Press refers to the band: \\"the little-known but excellent Pullman\\"  Influences  Pullman's influences have been both acknowledged by the band and noticed by the press, as evinced in Tim Ross' review of Turnstyles & Junkpiles in Spin magazine, in which he declares that \\"[t]he quartet's plaintive plucking echoes the pastoral finger- picking of John Fahey and Leo Kottke, but Pullman's pensively paced compositions allow each note to glisten in tranquil isolation.\\" Franklin Bruno, in his review of the band's debut album in CMJ New Music Monthly, also detects these influences, yet -like Ross- Bruno notices the band's singular take on the form: \\"Pullman deals in neither [Jim] O'Rourke's layered orchestration nor [John] Fahey's edginess, the live-to-tape recording [instead] nicely capturing the largely subdued playing.\\" The Chicago Reader, on the other hand, places \\"Pullman [musically] somewhere near Town and Country or early Gastr del Sol (which included Brown) in the vast interbred Chicago post-rock zoo.\\"  Critical reception  Critical reception of the band's work has oscillated from the dismissive to the unambiguously praiseful, with the Chicago Tribune declaring Turnstyles & Junkpiles \\"a disappointing bore\\", whilst The Wire has referred to the same album as \\"their excellent debut.\\" The New Musical Express's review of Pullman's first album stresses the uniqueness of the band's approach to the genre: \\"Pullman refuse to allow the comfortable and reflective drift off into reverie that would normally accompany such a scaled-down recording.\\" Giant Robot magazine called Viewfinder \\"a great album combining some of the best in music\\", going on to list the band's members, detailing their respective pedigrees, as did Jean-Baptiste Dupin writing for Les Inrockuptibles, describing Pullman \\"[a]s a land of suburbs, a small garden on the outskirts humbly handset by eight green hands\\".

He is a member of Donegal County Council, representing the Letterkenny Electoral Area. Due to his age (his political career peaking while an octogenarian) he is often portrayed as an underdog, \\"They're always writing me off. I don't worry about that\\", he once said after being re-elected. He has a special interest in the elderly, and has attracted attention after describing cuts to their care as a form of \\"euthanasia\\". He did a noteworthy dance after being re-elected in 2014. McGarvey has lived at Moorfield in Ramelton, County Donegal, for more than 50 years. In April 2013, in the early hours, his home was attacked with stones and with spray, prompting police intervention. McGarvey spent a year working in Germany in 1960. He played association football for Swilly Rovers and captained them to the FAI Junior Cup in 1962. He has been a teetotaller (abstaining from alcohol) throughout his life. Aged 82, McGarvey became Ireland's oldest Mayor and Donegal County Council's first Independent Mayor in June 2013, succeeding Frank McBrearty Jnr. Aged 85, he became Ireland's oldest ever general election candidate at the 2016 election. Having earlier been Mayor of County Donegal, McGarvey became Mayor of Letterkenny in June 2018 - he succeeded either Gerry McMonagle of Sinn F√©in or Jimmy Kavanagh of Fine Gael in that role. McGarvey was at this time approaching his 88th birthday and broke his own mayoral record set five years earlier. As Mayor of Letterkenny, McGarvey - at this stage aged 89 - returned to Germany for the first time since 1960, visiting the Thuringian twin town of Rudolstadt and having a vine there dedicated to him and his wife Marjorie and a plaque erected at a vineyard.

This group of > Communists was called the English-speaking branch. Davidson, he recalled, advised him against using his real name in the Party. By 1923, he was a member of the New York City Teachers Union, Local Union 5 AFT. There, Benjamin Mandel created a \\"Special Research Group,\\" affiliated with the Educational Workers International, itself recently created by the Red International of Labor Unions, which in turn was affiliated with the Soviet- dominated Comintern. Pressure from Communist members led to a majority of Local 5 to reject this chain of affiliation. Communist members of Local 5 included Mandel, Davidson, Bertram Wolfe, Jacob Lind, Rae Ragozin, Jack Hardy, Sarah Golden, Clara Reibert, Abraham Zitron, and Isadore Begun. In 1929, Wolfe and Davidson formed the \\"Progressive Group\\" among teachers. In 1934, when Davidson and others filed a minority board report that criticized a pro- Communist \\"Classroom Teachers Group\\" (CTG), the board ruled them out of order. He then helped form a \\"United Committee to Save the Union\\" in opposition to CTG control. They also formed a similar \\"Program Committee.\\" Also in 1929, Mandel and Davidson formed the Communist Party (Opposition). In 1935, Davidson left the Teachers Union and became a founding organizer of the Teachers' Guild. He appeared before the Rapp-Coudert Committee on November 28, 1940. Liberal Party of New York In 1944, Davidson formed the Liberal Party of New York State with George Counts, David Dubinsky of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, Alex Rose of the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers International Union, and theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Many had done so to break away from the American Labor Party. From its start, the Liberal Party was anti-communist. It was Davidson who motioned for the party's creation and name. Other leaders have included: John L. Childs, Adolf A. Berle, Jr., Dr. Timothy W. Costello, Dr. Donald Szantho Harrington, and James S. Notaro. In 1946, he partook in a newspaper debate, \\"Does American Need A Third Party?\\" in which he said: > America needs a third party. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have > repeatedly demonstrated their incapacity to solve the major problems of > American life. Both have held political power; yet, under both, large > sections of our population have lacked the food, clothing, housing, medical > care, and economic security people need and this country can provide. The > fundamental cleavages within the two old major parties prevent their > effectuating positive programs for achieving full employment, high > production levels, and improved living standards. In the Democratic Party, > Senators Wagner and Bilbo are diametrically opposed in outlook and action, > and similarly with Morse and Bricker in the Republican Party. The spread of > totalitarianism, the danger of a third and atomic war, the virus of religion > and racial bigotry and persecution require a political instrument that will > enable the people to meet these challenges‚Ä¶ These times demand that liberals > in all walks of life unite in a new, nation-wide third party that will > challenge the unholy alliance of Reactionary Republicans and Southern Tory > Democrats now dominating the Congress. Davidson was a frequent Liberal spokesperson. Typical issues included speeding laws and foreign policy. Special social issues included housing, welfare, racial equality and civil liberties. For example, in 1947, when the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for barring United Nations personnel from Peter Copper Village due to their race and color. Davidson called upon Governor Dewey and the New York legislature to oppose such actions as running counter to public policy. \\"The Liberal Party will do everything within its power, through education and legislation, to make feasible for persons, no mater of what color, race, religion, or creed, to be eligible to live in any housing project with benefits from tax exemption.\\" He remained prominent as the Liberal Party's executive director, as cited in newspapers in 1955 and 1957, when he was quoted as saying \\"Our own program thinks well\\" of the Wagner administration. The Liberal Party was important in New York from the 1940s through the 1960s, thanks to electoral fusion in the State of New York. The last and most successful power play of the Liberal Party occurred in 1969 when incumbent Republican mayor John V. Lindsay, who lost the Republican primary, joined the Liberal Party and achieved reelection as a Liberal candidate. Davidson served as full-time director of the party throughout this period, retiring in 1977 after 33 years of service. James S. Notaro was a subsequent executive director. Death At the time of his death, Davidson lived in Beverly Hills, California. He died of complications from myasthenia gravis, aged 90, at the Guardian Rehabilitation Hospital in Los Angeles. Personal life Davidson married Eve Chambers (Communist Party name \\"Eve Dorf\\") in the 1920s. They had two children, Karla Davidson Feitelberg and John Davidson. Eve Chambers Davidson died in Los Angeles on May 8, 2009, aged 108.

Frugo became famous from their original commercials. The brand is known for the slogan \\"Let's Frugo\\". History Frugo appeared in Poland in 1996. Six years later, its initial producer, Alima-Gerber, sold the brand to Krynica Zdr√≥j, which subsequently went bankrupt and the production of the drink ceased. In late 2009, the brand was bought by Aflofarm, a pharmaceutical company that originally wanted to reintroduce Frugo onto the market, as a trial run only in Coffeeheaven cafes and stores. The company later dropped these plans, stating that the brand didn't fit their company. In March 2011, Frugo was acquired by FoodCare Poland. The drink was reintroduced and has been available since July 2011, initially in four flavors (referred to as 'colors' in marketing), a set which was later expanded. Other related products were created, including Gellwe \\"Sweet Mug\\" kissel with Frugo flavours. In November 2011, larger 750 ml and 300 ml bottles of the drink appeared. The company also produces Frugo-branded ice cream. At the end of August 2012 Frugo jellies were launched, with green, black, red, and orange flavors.

It was found using the transit method, in which the dimming that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Its stellar flux is 15 ¬± 2 times Earth's. Due to its closer orbit to its star, it is a super-Venus or, if it has a volatile composition, a hot Neptune, with an estimated equilibrium temperature of , too hot to sustain life on its surface. Characteristics Mass, radius and temperature Kepler-62d is a super- Earth, an exoplanet with a radius and mass bigger than Earth, but smaller than that of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. It has an equilibrium temperature of . It has a radius of 1.95 . Because of its radius (and temperature), it is likely to be either a \\"super-Venus\\", or a hot mini-Neptune, with no solid surface. However, the mass is currently not known, estimates place an upper limit of 14 , the real mass is expected to be lower than this. The true value is likely around 5.5 , based on its composition. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) star named Kepler-62, orbited by a total of five planets. The star has a mass of 0.69 and a radius of 0.64 . It has a temperature of 4925 K and is 7 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star is somewhat metal-poor, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of ‚àí0.37, or 42% of the solar amount. Its luminosity () is 21% that of the Sun. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13.65. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Orbit Kepler-62d orbits its host star with an orbital period of 18 days at a distance of about 0.12 AU (compared to the distance of Mercury from the Sun, which is about 0.38 AU). It receives about 15 times more sunlight than Earth does from the Sun. Discovery In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-62; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-62d occurred roughly every 18 days (its orbital period), it was eventually concluded that a planetary body was responsible for the periodic 18-day transits. The discovery, along with the planetary system of the star Kepler-69 were announced on April 18, 2013.

Rayna has been portrayed by actress Connie Britton since the series' pilot episode, which aired on October 10, 2012. Britton, who does her own singing in the series, as do many of its other cast members, received critical acclaim for her performance as Rayna. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and a Satellite Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama. Casting and creation Connie Britton was cast as Rayna Jaymes on March 6, 2012. Rayna was characterized as the \\"reigning queen of country,\\" a 40-year-old country music superstar singer whose star is beginning to fade. The character of Rayna Jaymes is inspired from Britton's role as Tami Taylor on the TV series Friday Night Lights, with Nashville creator Callie Khouri creating the central characters as well as developing the core format specifically for Britton to star in the lead role. Britton states that her performance as Jaymes is based on several country singers, including Faith Hill (who was also born in 1967), Reba McEntire, and Bonnie Raitt. The writers also consulted country star Sara Evans when creating Rayna's character so that her experience of being a working mother in the music industry could be accurately portrayed. Background Rayna, a nine-time Grammy Award‚Äìwinner and fifteen-time CMA Award‚Äìnominee, inducted into the Grand Ole Opry as a member in 2005. She is the daughter of the late Virginia Wyatt and her husband, the late politician Lamar Wyatt (played by Powers Boothe) whom she was estranged from before he died due to him never approving of her career leading to her being kicked out at 16. Early in her career she dated songwriter and guitar player Deacon Claybourne at 16. In 1990 she released of her debut hit album Cowgirls Love Too Hard which featured the hit \\"Changing Grounds\\". The couple worked together for a large part of Jaymes 90s catalogue as he was her lead guitarist for two decades on tour and a frequent collaborator. Jaymes second album Southside of Love (1991) expanded her new age country sound that merged new age with traditional country. Jaymes 3rd album Home (1993) is recognized as one of the best country albums of the 1990s as it featured the iconic \\"No One Will Ever Love You\\". She followed this with the critically acclaimed Thoroughbred (1995) album which features the classic \\"The Last Stand\\". Her follow up album was the multi platinum \\"Postcards from Mexico\\" (1996). Ultimately Rayna had personal issues and had to break up with Deacon due to his destructive patterns after multiple iconic albums and tours worked on together. While Deacon was in rehab, Jaymes began dating and married financial advisor Teddy Conrad. The couple moved to a mansion in Nashville during the height of Jaymes music career and had two daughters together, Maddie and Daphne. Teddy though is not Maddie's biological father, she is Deacon's child, though Deacon and Maddie did not know until she was 12. Rayna's next album was the best selling female country album of the year, \\"Sweet & Sorrow\\" (1997). Her follow up displayed a newer image for the married woman and a increasingly mature sound for the hit album \\"Platinum Sea (1998) which features the hit \\"American Beauty\\". Maddie was born in 1999, the same year as Rayna's smash album Until You Kissed Me & multi-platinum song \\"This Love Ain't Big Enough\\". Daphne was born 2004 a year after the release of Jaymes multi-platinum record Double Down featuring the fan favorite song \\"Already Gone\\" which peaked at No. 1 on the country and Pop Charts.

Though the album was her first too miss the top 10 landing in the 20s and falling on the charts in its following week. She ultimately canceled her 'Belt Buckle Blues' tour and co-headlined with Country Pop singer Juliette Barnes on a single \\"Wrong Song\\" that was an instant hit and then led to co-headlined on tour with her, the 'Red Lips White Lies' tour. Rayna then began her own record label 'Highway 65 Records' in 2014 which she announced at the Grand Ole Opry. The 'Red Lips White Lies' tour was a sell out but was stopped at a halt after the death of Juliette's mother, near death of Rayna's father, and then the near death car crash of Jaymes with Deacon Claybourne that led to her being in a coma for two weeks. Once she recovered she suffered from vocal damage and decided to take time off to spend with her daughters. Though her follow up album was almost complete, her label wanted to rush release the album to capitalize on the publics re found love for Jaymes after her near death accident. Against Jaymes demands the label had police seize Jaymes for the masters to her album, threw out certain tracks, produced an album cover which featured her coming out of fire, and re-titled it '\\"Rising out of the ashes\\"'. This led to her buying herself out of Edgehill Republic Records that year for a total of $20,000,000.

This album was recorded while under Edgehill Republic and was her first album following her deadly car crash in 2013. The record ultimately was certified gold and its lead single \\"This Time\\" was certified platinum. She then went on to win 5 cmA's including 'Album of the year', 'Song of the year', 'Female vocalist of the year', 'Record of the year', and 'Entertainer of the year'.

Her latest album flopped so her record label suggests she open for the young country pop star Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere). Juliette hates Rayna because her mother Jolene (Sylvia Jefferies) was a fan of hers. When the president of their label, Marshall Evans, suggests that Rayna should collaborate with Juliette at a party for Edgehill, they write a song together. After their duet \\"Wrong Song\\" becomes a success, the two go on to co-headline a tour together. While Rayna is on tour Teddy visits her, telling her that he wants a divorce. When Marshall threatens to release a Greatest Hits album against her will, Rayna decides to work on a new album with a non-country producer, Liam McGuinness. At first, Liam doesn't want to work with her. He changes his mind and then joins her band. When Rayna has the idea to start her own label, Liam does something behind her back. She fires him and dissolves their partnership. The two later reconcile and continue to work on her album. While they are on a break from the tour, Liam asks Rayna to spend the weekend away with him in St. Lucia. While she is packing for the trip, she realizes it feels wrong for her to go. She then goes to Deacon and tells him that she loves him and always has. The two spend the night together. The morning after Rayna tells Tandy that she and Deacon spent the night together. Tandy says it was just one night‚Äì‚Äìa‚Äì‚Äìfling and Rayna replies that it will never be one night or a fling with them because how they have always had a relationship. Tandy mentions how it's always been all or nothing between them and asks her if that is what she and Deacon want. Teddy is not excited when he finds out that Rayna and Deacon may now be a couple. He is against it because there is a chance of Deacon finding out that he is Maddie's biological father. Teddy tells her they made an agreement when Maddie was born and she has to honor it. Rayna promises him that she would never want to hurt their relationship and plans on keeping it a secret. After Maddie overhears her mother telling someone \\"I love you\\" on the phone she asks who she said that to. Rayna tells her she said that to Deacon and that they are together now. Later in the day when Rayna and Teddy are not home, Maddie snoops through her mother's closet and finds a box that contains a paternity test. Maddie talks to a friend over the phone and says that Teddy might not be her father. The next day Maddie tells Deacon that he might be her father, which leaves Deacon shocked. Backstage at the CMA Awards, Deacon confronts Rayna about him possibly being Maddie's biological father. Rayna tells him the whole story of how she found out she was pregnant the last time he went to rehab. She talked about it with Teddy and they decided to get married and do a paternity test afterwards. Coleman advised her to cut ties with Deacon because they wanted him to get better. Teddy and Rayna wanted what was best for Maddie. Deacon storms off and goes to a bar and begins to drink again. On the night Juliette plays a show at the Bluebird Cafe, Rayna runs after a drunk Deacon who leaves the caf√© when the two notice each other. Rayna tells him that he is not driving anywhere and makes him move over to the passenger seat. On the way home the two argue which prevents Rayna from stopping at a stop sign. While swerving around the oncoming traffic, the car flips several times and lands in a ditch. Season 2 Rayna is put in a medically induced coma and hangs on to life for two weeks following the wreck. Deacon tells he was the one driving and pleads guilty of driving under the influence. Rayna wakes up and is able to say that she was the one driving the car and Deacon is set free. There are several flashbacks showing Rayna's and Deacon's lives around the time she got pregnant with Maddie. During the flashbacks, it is revealed that Deacon's proposal to Rayna was followed by Maddie's conception. The morning after, Rayna realizes that Deacon had been drinking and didn't realize he had proposed. She gives back the ring and leaves him. She finds out that she's pregnant and almost tells Deacon, but she sees him drunk, tearing up his cabin, and Tandy suggests not telling him about the pregnancy. Rayna struggles to get out of her contract with Edgehill and butts heads with the label's new CEO, Jeff Fordham, when he steals Will Lexington from Highway 65 and threatens to release a Rayna Jaymes Greatest Hits album against her will. Her father was going to loan her money to get her out of it but he was sent to prison before he had the chance to. She is eventually able to get out of her contract by using her mortgage. Tandy finds out Lamar was involved with the car crash that killed their mother but can't say anything about it. Rayna eventually finds out. Soon after Lamar is released from prison he suffers a fatal heart attack while visiting Teddy at his office. During the season, Rayna and Deacon are able to repair their friendship following the events of the wreck and his discovery that he is Maddie's biological father. Maddie and Deacon spend more time together, and he gives her music lessons, much to Teddy's dislike. Also during the season, Rayna begins dating fellow country music singer, Luke Wheeler. When Maddie uploads a video of herself singing, using Deacon's last name, the media soon finds out the truth about her paternity. Rayna, Teddy and Deacon go on GMA to talk about the situation, and Deacon says that Teddy did a great job raising Maddie. After Rayna and Luke finish singing \\"Ball and Chain\\" at her show at LP Field, Luke proposes to her on stage and she accepts. Later that night Deacon visits her telling her not to marry Luke because he now knows how to love her. He also proposes to her. Season 3 Rayna must make a decision whom to marry ‚Äì Luke or Deacon. She goes through old letters Deacon wrote to her, albums and starts playing their song, \\"Postcard from Mexico\\". While listening to the song she looks back at their relationship, which includes her going to his hotel room and finding him being passed out or being unable to find him anywhere. She also remembers a time that Luke was there for her. Rayna then goes to Deacon and tells him that she chooses Luke because they have a clean slate and that he is the safe choice. Deacon responds that he is not the right choice. Looking for new artists to sign at Highway 65, she comes across a fellow country singer, Sadie Stone, who is looking for a new record deal. When Rayna hears that Jeff Fordham of Edgehill is talking to Sadie, she does, too. Rayna's manager Bucky later tells her that Sadie is leaning towards Edgehill so Rayna rushes to her before contracts are signed. Sadie says that Edgehill can make her as big as 'Rayna Jaymes' but Rayna says no, only she (Sadie) can make herself big. Rayna then explains to her that Jeff only wants to sign her so he can show her off to his board so they will see that he has a female artist on his roster, then forget about her. With Highway 65, she (Rayna)won't. At the beginning of her show Sadie announces that she signed with Rayna, leaving Jeff furious. In retaliation, Jeff calls someone saying that he is interested in signing a young sister act then waves to Teddy. He wants to sign Maddie and Daphne. Rayna becomes closer to Juliette when she is the first person Juliette tells about her pregnancy. During her tour Rayna is also planning her wedding to Luke. Rayna and Luke go two months without really seeing each other and when they do have a few days off, Rayna uses that time to be interviewed by Rolling Stone. Luke is angry since they have barely seen each other. The Rolling Stone reporter then interviews her at home. As she, Luke, and the reporter walk around they hear loud music playing. They go find the noise and when they do, they walk in on Maddie and Luke's son, Colt, making out. Fearing that the reporter will write what he saw, Rayna goes to him and convinces him not to write about it, offering her story about Deacon instead. Rayna gets the most CMA nominations with six, including some for which she is up against Luke; 'Entertainer of the Year', 'Album' and 'Single'. When the CMA's finally come around, Rayna immediately wins the first award of the night for 'Single of the Year', beating Luke. During her speech, she thanks Deacon who co-wrote it with her. Luke is not pleased. Rayna beats out Luke again for 'Album of the Year'. So far, Luke has only won 'Male Vocalist' and then 'Musical Event' with Rayna. To blow off steam he drinks and his ego gets to him. He walks off to the restroom, and Rayna follows him to see what's wrong. He complains about her thanking Deacon, saying she came to the show with him, not Deacon, and he is the reason her album went gold because he proposed to her the day it was released. As the show closes, Rayna sweeps her nominations and wins 'Entertainer of the Year'. At home, Luke apologizes for his behavior. He blames it on his ego and drinking and assures her that she is the only reason her album went gold. As her wedding day approaches, Rayna starts to feel unsure about going through it. The girls talk about going to boarding school when they hear from Luke that his kids do. Rayna disapproves of them talking about that with him, without her. She tells the girls they aren't going to boarding school. One of the reasons is because she feels that everything is changing and not for the better. On the day of the wedding, Rayna tells Luke she can't marry him and calls it off, leaving him furious. Later that day, Rayna goes to Deacon to tell him she loves him and always has, but she needs some time for herself.' Jeff now only wants to sign Maddie so he can have a singer like Taylor Swift on his roster. He blackmails Teddy into signing his consent that Maddie be signed since only one parent's consent is necessary. Rayna is furious when she finds out but she is able to prevent it when she tells Jeff's boss about Layla overdosing at Jeff's house, among other things. In addition to Maddie not getting signed, Jeff gets fired and Edgehill folds. Deacon finds out he has liver cancer but doesn't want Rayna to know. He tells Scarlett he is supposed to take care of Rayna, not the other way around. He keeps his distance from her for a while until she asks him to sing with her to celebrate the tenth anniversary of her induction into the Grand Ole Opry. When they finish singing he runs off to avoid talking to her. He goes to his cabin at the lake but she follows him. Deacon finally tells her that he has cancer and she breaks down. After spending all day at the lake talking, they finally get back together. They go back to Rayna's house so they can tell the girls they are back together, and so Deacon can tell them he is sick. With Deacon's sister, Beverly, being his only match as a donor, Rayna goes to Mississippi to ask her but Beverly refuses. Rayna and Beverly don't have a good history with each other because years ago Deacon chose to join Rayna's band instead of making it big with Beverly, and Beverly resents Rayna for that. Beverly eventually agrees to be his donor. As the surgery approaches, Deacon has nightmares about dying. Before he goes into the O.R. he asks Rayna to marry him right then and there. She tells him no, they will wait until after the operation so they can have a proper ceremony. They do, however, recite wedding vows to each other. Rayna assures him that he is going to be alright. While waiting for the surgery to be over, Dr. Rand tells Rayna something has gone wrong. The heart-monitor then appears on screen showing a flat-line, leaving viewers to wonder if it was Deacon or Beverly who flat- lined. Season 4 A month has past since the transplant. Deacon and Beverly made it through the surgery although Beverly had an aneurysm and is in a coma. Rayna, who just officially dropped Juliette from Highway 65, gets a call from her, crying and saying she needs help. Rayna flies out to Los Angeles to see her because she cares about her. When Rayna tries to talk to her after her set she doesn't have much luck. Juliette yells at her and says she is not having good luck with Highway 65. On her way back home in Nashville, Rayna hears the radio DJ's criticizing her about letting Juliette go and how she is not that good at running a label. In an effort to save her label Rayna tries to find a big-name artist to sign. She comes up with a rock star named Markus Keen who is looking for a new label but Bucky thinks it won't work because he is a rock artist. On a flight to New York she is conveniently seated right next to Markus. During the flight she smooth talks him about switching to country, convincing him that at her label he can be heard. Markus ends up signing with her. Scarlett makes the tough decision of taking Beverly off life support. At the funeral Deacon breaks down during the eulogy so Rayna takes over. After the funeral, Markus calls Rayna saying he is on his way to Nashville and ready to work. Rayna gets mad at Maddie when she finds out Juliette invited her to sing on stage with her in Atlanta and punishes her. She is having a tough time with Maddie and brings her and Daphne to the meeting with Markus. Markus gets Rayna to produce his album after he fires Avery for not \\"getting\\" his \\"vision\\", among other things. While working on the album he acts like an arrogant brat, as usual. He and Rayna don't see eye-to-eye so he storms off, saying this was a mistake. Markus eventually gets her version of his song now. Deacon decides to buy into a bar with one of his buddies, Frankie Grey, who was his AA sponsor. Rayna is unsure about it because he is a recovering alcoholic. They get into an argument over it but she eventually supports him. Deacon proposes to Rayna and she says yes. When Rayna and Deacon's wedding day arrives, the paparazzi has discovered where the wedding is going to be held ‚Äì at Rayna's late mother's country property, where she has many wonderful childhood memories with her mother and Tandy. Rayna's publicist finds a private barn where the wedding can be held out of the public eye. Maddie is concerned about her parents getting married because sometimes Deacon can be violent; for instance, when he pushed a paparazzi photographer out of the way and broke his camera in rage. Daphne is concerned about the marriage, too, because she's worried about being the outsider. Rayna assures both of the girls that there is nothing to worry about because they are a family and nothing is going to tear that apart, and Deacon loves them both more than anything. Tandy is openly opposed to the marriage and threatens to hunt Deacon down if he ever hurts her sister. The ceremony proceeds as ceremony, and Rayna and Deacon are now married. Maddie runs away from home to live with Frankie's daughter Cash, and Cash is going to help her with her career. Cash tells Maddie about the recording contract at Edgehill she was offered that she didn't know about. Maddie feels that her mother is standing in her way and wants to be emancipated so she can take control of her career. Rayna doesn't want Maddie to be like her, when she was younger and left home for a career. She wants to shield her from being exploited, but she also fears she is losing her. At the hearing Deacon's violent, drunken past is exposed to the judge. The lawyer uses this as a tool to help get Maddie emancipated. Deacon realizes the only way the lawyer knew all of that is because Frankie told Cash, who then told the lawyer. Deacon then confronts Frankie outside of their bar. The two get into a brawl after Frankie sucker punches him. Just as Deacon bloodies Frankie's nose, everyone from inside comes out to, and Frankie accuses Deacon of trying to kill him. This causes the judge to decide to grant Maddie's emancipation. Cash wants Maddie to get away from Nashville so there will be no connections to Rayna, and Maddie signs with a shady label in New York. When an older record producer attempts to assault Maddie, Deacon bursts in and rescues her. Maddie reconciles with her family, and as the season comes to a close Rayna, Deacon, Maddie and Daphne are a happy family once more. Season 5 Rayna has her family back at last. The season opens with the family watching the news coverage of Juliette's plane crash. Rayna has some financial problems with the label hitting some bumps in the road. She agrees to play at a private event in Silicon Valley hosted by an app developer named Zach Wells (who is a fanboy of hers) as a way to bring in money. Zach informs Rayna that he is on his way to Nashville. He wants to \\"hack her cloud\\" and wants to go into business with her. She and Deacon are unsure of the proposal, but she needs the money. In return, Zach wants 20% of Highway 65. Luke has put Wheelin' Dealin' Records up for sale, and Zach wants Highway 65 to acquire it. Rayna gets inspired for her and Deacon to write their story for a concept album featuring the two of them. Rayna also has a stalker. One day when she walks into work, someone watches her as they listen to her music. A few days later Rayna discovers a mysterious package with no stamp at her door. It contains a letter and rose petals. More mysterious letters show up and she and Bucky try to figure out who is behind them. The man who wrote the letters, Carl Hockney, shows up at Highway 65, which alarms her. Bucky escorts him out while she calls for security. She gets a restraining order against Hockney and increases security at her house. One day Hockney shows up at Daphne's school. He taunts the Jaymes/Claybourne household by going as far as he can while still obeying the restraining order. This drives them crazy, turning their lives upside down, and Deacon wants to confront him, but the police advise not to do that. They want him arrested but he hasn't done anything for which he can be arrested. He eventually violates the restraining order by surprising Rayna at work. He holes up in her office where they talk, and when she tries to get free he catches her and threatens her with a knife. After pleas from Rayna and the police he lets her go and is arrested. The police take her home, and as she is on the phone with Deacon to tell him what happened an oncoming car crashes into them, sending Rayna to the hospital. Due to the crash, Rayna has a shattered pelvis and hip, and is in surgery for four hours. Lying in her hospital bed, Rayna sees her dead mother and talks to her. This worries Deacon because he knows people can experience that when they are on the brink of death, but the doctor tells him not to worry. Daphne's choir comes to the hospital to support her. While they sing for Rayna she crashes and is sent to the ICU. Her organs are failing, her condition worsens and her outcome isn't too promising. She can't hold on any longer, and dies with her family by her side. Following her death, Bucky announced that the CMT Awards (where Rayna was scheduled to perform) had planned a musical tribute by Faith Hill. Juliette convinces the organizers that she knew Rayna best and should sing instead, however, when she comes to perform \\"Sanctuary\\", she leaves the stage and allows Maddie to sing instead. Maddie breaks down halfway through the song and is then joined by Daphne and Deacon, with the trio receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. Rayna's death causes tension within the family when Teddy and Tandy suggest that the girls should live with Teddy (as Daphne is biologically his and Deacon has proven to be an unstable parent). Tandy also states that Deacon is not fully equipped to run Highway 65. Eventually, Teddy realizes that Rayna would have wanted Maddie and Daphne to stay with Deacon. At a Highway 65 meeting, Deacon is furious when Zach states that they should release Deacon and Rayna's duet album (as Rayna had completed the majority of her studio recordings before her death) although he later comes to see that the album is the perfect way to end Rayna's career. Deacon goes into their home studio where he finds Bucky, Gunnar, Scarlett, Will, Avery, Juliette, Maddie and Daphne all singing along with Rayna's recording of the track \\"You're Mine\\" and he joins them, seeing it as their final song together. Season 6 Rayna appears briefly in the season finale in a flashback to her and Deacon's wedding night at Deacon's cabin. Rayna notes that she and Deacon are at her favorite place on the planet because she is with him. The two discuss their relationship with Deacon telling Rayna that he feels everything is too good to be true and after all the things he's done and all the drama they've seen, he finds it hard to believe that the two are together. Rayna tells him that yes, they've hurt each other and they have their past, but reassures him that once in everyone's life, someone gets into your bloodstream and it doesn't matter how much they fail each other, they must choose each other. She tells Deacon that she chooses him exactly the way he is and that she will love him forever. Departure After CMT picked up Nashville in summer 2016, there were rumors that Britton would depart the series after ten episodes. In the ninth episode of season 5, Rayna dies onscreen following injuries from a car crash. Discussing her reason for leaving the show, Britton stated \\"various reasons, had been percolating for me. What was really important to me was that it felt like the right time.\\" \\"There were a lot of different factors that played into it; it was a cumulative thing. I don't need to go into greater detail about what that was but, for me it felt like the timing was important and my No. 1 priority was the show and making sure that it was done in the right way.\\" References External links * Rayna Jaymes on IMDb Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional characters from Tennessee Category:Fictional singers Category:Nashville (2012 TV series) ","title":"Rayna Jaymes"},{"id":"39158602","text":"Darrin Fitzgerald is an American former basketball player who is known for his collegiate career at Butler University.

Neu? released in 2001, after the band had split up. It consists of a recording of their final concert, held at Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf on 19 July 1998. Immediately after the concert, the band disbanded amicably (in part due to pressure from Klaus Dinger's ex-bandmate Michael Rother, who resented Dinger's use of the word \\"Neu!\\" in La! Neu?'s name). Concert and release The concert was organised by Dinger's friends in the D√ºsseldorf academic community - for example Dr. Ralf Gawlista, who managed Dinger's website. It was to be the only concert La! Neu? would ever play in Germany (they toured Japan in 1996) as well as the band's final performance together (at least under the La! Neu? name). The concert begins with a short piano overture before launching into a 32-minute rendition of \\"Autoportrait Rembrandt\\" (from Year of the Tiger) in which Spinello Elze's guitar is added to Rembrandt Lensink's synthesizer and Victoria Wehrmeister's vocals. Dinger played drums in concert for the first time since 1972. At the end of the song Dinger twice interrupts Lensink and Wehrmeister's improvisation because he felt they were playing for too long: \\"Vicky, Rembrandt, shut up!\\".track: \\"Autoportrait Rembrandt\\" This is followed by \\"Zeeland Wunderbar\\" from Goldregen. Dinger's mother Renate sang lead vocals on stage, as on the album version. \\"Notre Dame\\" follows, again from Year of the Tiger. Disc 2 opens with a piano and vocal improvisation by Lensink and Wehrmeister (not actually a live version of the song of the same name from Goldregen). Dinger interrupts the song half-way through, asking the audience to be quiet, before realising that the talking he can hear (clearly audible on the recording) is coming from outside the concert hall. This is followed by an ambient recording of the last 30 seconds of a concert-break leading into \\"Comme Nuages\\" (from Goldregen), on which Dinger plays harmonium. This is followed by a second (possibly non-continuous) concert pause, in which the band can be heard practicing \\"The Hit ? Demo\\" acoustically. \\"The Hit ? Demo\\" uses the same drum loop used for \\"Notre Dame\\", but sped up, and is the only song performed not to feature on a La! Neu? studio album. The final song is a moving version of \\"Time\\" from La D√ºsseldorf's debut album, in which Victoria Wehrmeister both sings and plays a hand-drum. The album closes with two minutes of applause. The album was mastered in 2001 by Kazuyuki Onouchi, with whom Dinger would make his next album: Japandorf. A video recording of the concert made by Thomas Dinger exists, and a small portion has been uploaded to YouTube. The booklet is largely constructed of the film negatives of Thomas Dinger's video.

It can be obtained from plain chickpea cooking brine (or from several other legumes). It enables egg-avoiding cooks to replicate such elusive egg dishes as macarons or lemon meringue pie. Tofu may be used for creating egg-like dishes. * Tofu can be used as an egg substitute in recipes that use many eggs, like quiches or custards. Tofu doesn't fluff up like eggs, but it does create a texture that is suitable for \\"eggy\\" dishes. For fluffy egg dishes such as omelette the silken tofu variety may be used. * In desserts and sweet, baked food, many fruits can be used to serve the same purpose as eggs. To replace one egg, the following fruits can be substituted: ** 1 banana ** 1/4 cup canned pumpkin or squash ** 1/4 cup applesauce ** 1/4 cup pur√©ed prunes However, these will also add some flavor to the recipe. * For baking cookies, brownies, bars, etc., combine 1 Tbsp ground flax seeds with 3 Tbsp warm water and let sit for a few minutes to let thicken before stirring into the recipe. The flax seed must be freshly ground, or refrigerated; commercial ground flax loses the essential oils that make this work. 1 Tbsp flax seed is equivalent to one egg; simply multiply as needed. The flax seed thickens and acts as a binding agent in the recipe. Chef In You advises that adding ¬º tsp baking powder will serve as a leavening agent, as well. * Eggs are also used to provide moisture, in which case they can be substituted with 1/4 cup of water, milk, plant milk, fruit juice or fruit puree per egg. * Ground chia seeds can also be used to thicken dishes or as a binding agent. Follow the same instructions as for ground flax seeds, above. If it is important to maintain the colour of the recipe, use white chia seeds rather than the dark ones, which would darken the final product. * Chickpea flour can be used in many recipes to provide both the texture and colour that eggs would otherwise provide, as well as nutritional benefits including protein, folate, iron, calcium, and many other vitamins and minerals. 1/4 cup chickpea flour combined with 1/4 cup water or other liquid is equivalent to one egg. Veganbaking.net notes that the only drawback to chickpea flour is that it tastes terrible prior to cooking, so if unbaked batter will be eaten, it is advisable to use a different option, like flax or chia seeds, which does not alter the taste of the recipe.

It has influences from American hip hop and also from traditional music from the region. It is usually considered to have emerged from mid-2000s and reached its consolidation by 2009 when the first public concert was held in the French Cultural Institute. Although it has a variety of themes, there was an intense production of political songs by the Yemeni Revolution. History Context The Yemeni populations is one of the poorest of the Arab world and estimated to have a median age of 18 years. Sammy Nash was one of the biggest names in modernizing the rap scene also known as S19Around 60% of it is under the age of 25. In this sense, the Yemeni youth has constantly been related to issues regarding violence, unemployment, the controversial use of khat, participation in radical political groups, and other social problems. On the other hand, it has been a major actor in the latest political transformations and also on the development of a vivid hip hop scenery, facts that aren't coincidentally associated. The hip hop expressions often contemplates social-political issues and played an important role on the Yemeni Revolution. Thus, the dynamicity of the Yemeni youth has been both the spontaneous generator and the vessel of a large hip hop scene in the country, even though facing lack of institutional support. Origins The hip hop major outbreak in Yemen is often associated to the influence of the king of rap in Yemen Hagage \\"AJ\\" Masaed, an American-Yemeni rapper producing music since 1997. Although he had grown in the United States, AJ has successfully reached Yemeni audience by addressing to local issues and incorporating traditional musical language into his hits. This versatility was also one of the reasons he drew international recognition, since he entered in the Yemeni music scene, he has been partnering up with several Yemeni artists, such as Sammy Nash ( S19 ) Hussein Muhib, Fuad Al-Kibisi, Fuad Al-Sharjabi, Ibrahim Al-Taefi, Abdurahman Al-Akhfash and others, and helping new ones to develop their talents. He has also played a major role on propagating the understanding of rap as a means of change. The second king of Rap in Yemen is Smokie Almo,aka YungYem, known by his American-Arabic Rap where he would mix Yemeni Arabic and American English in his songs. YungYem gained a huge popularity amongst Yemeni people mostly the youth. One contributing factor to the development of the music is also the creation of Yemen Music House in 2007 that has been providing assets to the development of a contemporary music scene. In 2009, took place the first Yemeni Rap public festival, co-sponsored by the French and German foreign- missions. Due to the importance of this event, AJ draws a comparison between it and the fall of the Berlin wall. Rap and the revolution 2011‚Äì2012 Yemeni revolution (from Al Jazeera) - 20110224 Since the Arab Revolutions have been mostly associated to youth movements, music have been thoroughly present in these processes. The Arabic rap music has been spread out and recognized by young Arab audiences. One recurrent example is the Tunisian rapper El G√©n√©ral. In the Yemeni case, one popular artist is Yemen's Monsters and Kawi, but there are and many other rappers that have been producing independently and publishing on social medias. Most often, these songs are displayed on YouTube featuring images of the revolution, addressing a call for the Yemeni youth and singing \\"Erhal\\" (Arabic for \\"leave\\", that has been the slogan of street manifestations) to the former dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh. Rap has been used to mobilize the youth as a language they can relate to, one example is the employment of this music style by the comedian Adre'i on a public manifestation, and that have also been spread as viral on the internet. Musical influences Yemeni rap has strong roots on American rap, differing, for example, from what is made in the Maghreb that gets influences from French rap. AJ himself is American based, but he also mentions 2Pac as an influence on local rap enthusiasts. Besides that, artists such as AJ mixes with traditional Yemeni music and even incorporates local instruments on their productions. The American influence is also evident when many artists choose to mix Arabic language with English language on their lyrics. Examples are the young and still independent artists such as Smokie Almo aka YungYem, Monika and Nadir Mohammed Haidar, and also Nadeem \\"Yung Sheikh\\" Al-Eryani, who has already made appearances on CNN and Al-Hurra televisions. . There's also a Yemeni-Polish rap group PSW, which use both Polish and Arabic language in their songs focusing strictly on politics. Traditional Yemeni music of the Jewish community is world widely recognized and has also been influence for foreigner artists of Yemeni origins, such as Diwon an American Jewish DJ that mixes hip hop, afro beat and Arabic music. Hip Hop culture As Hip Hop is most usually known to be an entire cultural movement that is not restricted to rap music, it has been also developing in Yemen by its other expression, such as breakdancing, as portrayed on the documentary Shake The Dust and considered to be an alternative activity for Yemeni youth rather than other social activities such as 'yukhazan', the social practice of consuming khat. Street art and graffiti have also been actively emerging after the revolution as a political tool.

The church was a meeting place of Asbury and Coke. The history of Methodism in the United States dates back to the mid-18th century with the ministries of early Methodist preachers such as Laurence Coughlan and Robert Strawbridge. Following the American Revolution most of the Anglican clergy who had been in America came back to England. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, sent Thomas Coke to America where he and Francis Asbury founded the Methodist Episcopal Church, which was to later establish itself as the largest denomination in America during the 19th century. Methodism thrived in America thanks to the First and Second Great Awakenings beginning in the 1700s. Various African-American denominations were formed during this period, including the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In the early 20th century, many of the splintered Methodist groups joined together to form The Methodist Church (USA). Another merger in 1968 resulted in the formation of The United Methodist Church from the Evangelical United Brethren (EUB) and the Methodist Church. Other smaller Methodist denominations in the United States, including those that split from the Methodist Episcopal Church, exist, such as the Free Methodist Church, Evangelical Methodist Church, Congregational Methodist Church, Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, among others. Origins In 1735, the Wesley brothers, John and Charles, went to the Georgia Colony to minister to the colonialists and teach the Gospel to the Native American tribes. John Wesley returned to England and met with a group of Moravian Church clergymen he respected. He said, \\"they appeared to be of one heart, as well as of one judgment, resolved to be Bible- Christians at all events; and, wherever they were, to preach with all their might plain, old, Bible Christianity\\". The Wesley ministers retained their membership in the Church of England. Though not always emphasized or appreciated in the Anglican churches of their day, their teaching emphasized salvation by God's grace, apprehended through faith in Christ. Three teachings they saw as the foundation of Christian faith were: # People are all, by nature, \\"dead in sin,\\" and, consequently, \\"children of wrath.\\" # They are \\"justified by faith alone.\\" # Faith produces inward and outward holiness. Very quickly, these clergymen became popular, attracting large congregations. The nickname students had used against the Wesleys was revived; they and their followers became known as Methodists.Wesley, John. A Short History of Methodism. Online: . Accessed May 1, 2009. Early missionaries to America In 1766, Reverend Laurence Coughlan arrived in Newfoundland and opened a school at Black Head in Conception Bay.Religion in Newfoundland and Labrador: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage. Heritage.nf.ca. Retrieved on 2011-12-11. In the late 1760s, two Methodist lay preachers emigrated to America and formed societies. Philip Embury began the work in New York at the instigation of fellow Irish Methodist Barbara Heck. Soon, Captain Webb from the British Army aided him. He formed a society in Philadelphia and traveled along the coast. In 1770, two authorized Methodist preachers, Richard Boardman and Joseph Pilmoor, arrived from the British Connexion. They were immediately preceded by the unauthorized Robert Williams who quietly set about supporting himself by publishing American editions of Wesley's hymnbooks without obtaining permission to do so. These men were soon followed by others, including Francis Asbury. Asbury reorganized the mid-Atlantic work in accordance with the Wesleyan model. Internal conflict characterized this period. Missionaries displaced most of the local preachers and irritated many of the leading lay members. During the American Revolution, \\"the mid-Atlantic work\\" (as Wesley called it) diminished, and, by 1778, the work was reduced to one circuit. Asbury refused to leave. He remained in Delaware during this period. Robert Strawbridge began a Methodist work in Maryland at the same time as Embury began his work in New York. They did not work together and did not know of each other's existence. Strawbridge ordained himself and organized a circuit. He trained many very influential assistants who became some of the first leaders of American Methodism. His work grew rapidly both in numbers and in geographical spread. The British missionaries discovered Strawbridge's work and annexed it into the American connection. However, the native preachers continued to work side by side with the missionaries, and they continued to recruit and dispatch more native preachers. Southern Methodism was not dependent on missionaries in the same way as mid-Atlantic Methodism. Thomas Coke, the first Methodist bishop Up until this time, with the exception of Strawbridge, none of the missionaries or American preachers was ordained. Consequently, the Methodist people received the sacraments at the hands of ministers from established Anglican churches. Most of the Anglican priests were Loyalists who fled to England, New York or Canada during the war. In the absence of Anglican ordination, a group of native preachers ordained themselves. This caused a split between the Asbury faction and the southern preachers. Asbury mediated the crisis by convincing the southern preachers to wait for Wesley's response to the sacramental crisis. That response came in 1784. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, came to believe that the New Testament evidence did not leave the power of ordination to the priesthood in the hands of bishops but that other priests could do ordination. In 1784, he ordained preachers for Scotland and England and America, with power to administer the sacraments (this was a major reason for Methodism's final split from the Church of England after Wesley's death). At that time, Wesley sent the Rev. Dr. Thomas Coke to America to form an independent American Methodist church. The native circuit riders met in late December. Coke had orders to ordain Asbury as a joint superintendent of the new church. However, Asbury turned to the assembled conference and said he would not accept it unless the preachers voted him into that office. This was done, and from that moment forward, the general superintendents received their authority from the conference. Later, Coke convinced the general conference that he and Asbury were bishops and added the title to the discipline. It caused a great deal of controversy. Wesley did not approve of 'bishops' who had not been ordained by bishops. The first annual conference of the newly organized Methodist Episcopal Church was held at Green Hill House near Louisburg, Franklin County, North Carolina, April 19, 1785. Four annual conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church were held at the house of Green Hill and Hill was their host. By the 1792 general conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the controversy relating to episcopal power boiled over. Ultimately, the delegates sided with Bishop Asbury. However, the Republican Methodists split off from the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) in 1792. Also, William Hammet (a missionary ordained by Wesley who traveled to America from Antigua with Bishop Coke), led a successful revolt against the MEC in 1791. He opposed Bishop Asbury and the episcopacy. He formed his people into the American Primitive Methodist Church (not directly connected with the British Primitive Methodist Church). Both American churches operated in the Southeast and presaged the episcopal debates of later reformers. Regardless, Asbury remained the leading bishop of early American Methodism and did not share his \\"appointing\\" authority until Bishop McKendree was elected in 1808. Coke had problems with the American preachers. His authoritarian style alienated many. Soon, he became a missionary bishop of sorts and never had much influence in America. First and Second Awakenings Illustration from The Circuit Rider: A Tale of the Heroic Age by Edward Eggleston depicting a Methodist circuit rider on horseback. The First Great Awakening was a religious movement among colonials in the 1730s and 1740s. The English Calvinist Methodist preacher George Whitefield played a major role, traveling up and down the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style, accepting everyone as his audience. The new style of sermons and the way people practiced their faith breathed new life into religion in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. People began to study the Bible at home, which effectively decentralized the means of informing the public on religious matters and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the Protestant Reformation. The first American Methodist bishops were Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury, whose boyhood home, Bishop Asbury Cottage, in West Bromwich, England, is now a museum. Upon the formation of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America at the Baltimore Christmas Conference in 1784, Coke (already ordained in the Church of England) ordained Asbury a deacon, elder, and bishop each on three successive days. Circuit riders, many of whom were laymen, traveled by horseback to preach the gospel and establish churches until there was scarcely any crossroad community in America without a Methodist expression of Christianity. One of the most famous circuit riders was Robert Strawbridge who lived in the vicinity of Carroll County, Maryland soon after arriving in the Colonies around 1760.Frederick E. Maser, Robert Strawbridge: First American Methodist Circuit Rider (Rutland, Vt.: Academy Books, 1983), 11‚Äì25 the number of local Methodist churches (blue) grew rapidly in all parts of the country; it was the largest denomination by 1820.Data from Edwin Scott Gaustad, Historical Atlas of Religion in America (2nd ed. 1976) pp 4,4 The Second Great Awakening was a nationwide wave of revivals, from 1790 to 1840. In New England, the renewed interest in religion inspired a wave of social activism among Yankees; Methodism grew rapidly and established several colleges, notably Boston University. In the \\"burned over district\\" of western New York, the spirit of revival burned brightly. Methodism saw the emergence of a Holiness movement. In the west, especially at Cane Ridge, Kentucky and in Tennessee, the revival strengthened the Methodists and the Baptists. The Methodists appealed especially to the urban middle class.Richard Carwardine, \\"The Second Great Awakening in the Urban Centers: An Examination of Methodism and the New Measures',\\" Journal of American History (1972) 59#2 pp: 327-340. in JSTOR Civil War and Reconstruction Disputes over slavery placed the church in difficulty in the first half of the 19th century, with the northern church leaders fearful of a split with the South, and reluctant to take a stand. The Wesleyan Methodist Connexion (later became The Wesleyan Church) and the Free Methodist Churches were formed by staunch abolitionists, and the Free Methodists were especially active in the Underground Railroad, which helped to free the slaves. Finally, in a much larger split, in 1845 at Louisville, the churches of the slaveholding states left the Methodist Episcopal Church and formed The Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The northern and southern branches were reunited in 1939, when slavery was no longer an issue. In this merger also joined the Methodist Protestant Church. Some southerners, conservative in theology, and strongly segregationist, opposed the merger, and formed the Southern Methodist Church in 1940. Many Northerners had only recently become religious and religion was a powerful force in their lives. No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the Methodist Episcopal Church. Carwardine argues that for many Methodists, the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the terror unleashed on godly abolitionists, release from the Slave Power's evil grip on the state, and a new direction for the Union.Richard Carwardine, \\"Methodists, Politics, and the Coming of the American Civil War,\\" Church History, September 2000, Vol. 69 Issue 3, pp 578-609 in JSTOR Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the Radical Republicans with their hard line toward the white South.

Luccock, Paul Hutchinson, and Robert W. Goodloe, The Story of Methodism (1926) This organization, along with the church's Department of Education for Negroes of the Board of Education, helped provide education to former slaves and their children. Within three months of its organization, the Freedmen's Aid Society had begun work in the South. By the end of the first year, the society had more than fifty teachers. The Third Great Awakening from 1858 to 1908 saw enormous growth in Methodist membership, and a proliferation of institutions such as colleges (e.g., Morningside College). Methodists were often involved in the Missionary Awakening and the Social Gospel Movement. The awakening in so many cities in 1858 started the movement, but in the North it was interrupted by the Civil War. In the South, on the other hand, the Civil War stimulated revivals, especially in Lee's army. Modern history Meeting of the West Michigan Conference of The United Methodist Church. In 1914‚Äì1917 many Methodist ministers made strong pleas for world peace. To meet their demands, President Woodrow Wilson (a Presbyterian), promised \\"a war to end all wars.\\" In the 1930s many Methodists favored isolationist policies. Thus in 1936, Methodist Bishop James Baker, of the San Francisco Conference, released a poll of ministers showing 56% opposed warfare. However, the Methodist Federation did call for a boycott of Japan, which had invaded China and was disrupting missionary activity there.[Meyer 200, 354] In Chicago, sixty-two local African Methodist Episcopal churches voted their support for the Roosevelt administration's policy, while opposing any plan to send American troops overseas to fight. When war came in 1941, the vast majority of Methodists strongly supported the national war effort, but there were also a few (673Methodist World Peace Commission administered Civilian Public Service units at Duke University Hospital in Durham, North Carolina and Cherokee State (Psychiatric) Hospital in Cherokee, Iowa (list of CPS Camps).) conscientious objectors. The United Methodist Church was formed in 1968 as a result of a merger between the Evangelical United Brethren (EUB) and The Methodist Church (USA). The former church had resulted from mergers of several groups of German Methodist heritage. There was no longer any need or desire to worship in the German language. The merged church had approximately 9 million members as of the late 1990s. While United Methodist Church in America membership has been declining, associated groups in developing countries are growing rapidly.World Growth of the United Methodist Church in Comparative Perspective: A Brief Statistical Analysis  Robert. Methodist Review. Retrieved on 2011-12-11. American Methodist churches are generally organized on a connectional model, related but not identical to that used in Britain. Pastors are assigned to congregations by bishops, distinguishing it from presbyterian government. Methodist denominations typically give lay members representation at regional and national meetings (conferences) at which the business of the church is conducted, making it different from most episcopal government (The Episcopal Church USA, however, has a representational polity giving lay members, priests, and bishops voting privileges). This connectional organizational model differs further from the congregational model, for example of Baptist, and Congregationalist Churches, among others. Richard Allen, the founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In addition to the United Methodist Church, there are over 40 other denominations that descend from John Wesley's Methodist movement. Some, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the AME Zion Church,The Doctrines and Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, with an Appendix; Revised by the General Conference, Atlanta, Georgia 16‚Äì22 July 2008.

Zion Publishing House, 2008. ¬∂2, ¬∂3, ¬∂656. the Free Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church (formerly Wesleyan Methodist Connection), the Congregational Methodist Church and First Congregational Methodist Church are explicitly Methodist. The Primitive Methodist Church is a continuing branch of the former British Primitive Methodist Church. Others do not call themselves Methodist, but are related to varying degrees. The Evangelical Church was formed by a group of EUB congregations who dissented from the merger which formed the United Methodist Church. The United Methodist Church has also taken steps to strengthen ties with its fellow Methodist churches, as well as other Protestant denominations in the United States. Since 1985, the UMC has been exploring a possible merger with three historically African-American Methodist denominations: the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. A Commission on Pan Methodist Cooperation and Union formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger. Grace Wesleyan Methodist Church is a parish church of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and is located in Akron, Ohio. The holiness revival was primarily among people of Methodist persuasion, who felt that the church had once again become apathetic, losing the Wesleyan zeal. Some important events of this revival were the writings of Phoebe Palmer during the mid-19th century, the establishment of the first of many holiness camp meetings at Vineland, New Jersey in 1867, and the founding of Asbury College (1890), and other similar institutions in the US around the turn of the 20th century. The Allegheny Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church entered into a schism with the rest of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, a Methodist denomination in the holiness movement, because it favored a connexional polity and opposed the merger of the Wesleyan Methodist Church with the Pilgrim Holiness Church; while the rest of the Wesleyan Methodist Church became the Wesleyan Church, the Allegheny Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church became the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, which today, is one of the largest denominations in the conservative holiness movement. From its beginning in England, Methodism laid emphasis on social service and education. Numerous originally Methodist institutions of higher education were founded in the United States in the early half of the 19th century, and today altogether there are about twenty universities and colleges named as \\"Methodist\\" or \\"Wesleyan\\" still in existence. Additionally, the Methodist Church has created a number of Wesley Foundation establishments on college campuses. These ministries are created to reach out to students, and often provide student housing to a few students in exchange for service to the ministry. United Methodist elders and pastors may marry and have families. They are placed in congregations by their bishop. Elders and pastors can either ask for a new appointment or their church can request that they be re-appointed elsewhere. If the elder is a full-time pastor, the church is required to provide either a house or a housing allowance for the pastor. Whereas most American Methodist worship is modeled after the Anglican Communion's Book of Common Prayer, a unique feature was the once practiced observance of the season of Kingdomtide, which encompasses the last thirteen weeks before Advent, thus dividing the long season after Pentecost into two discrete segments. During Kingdomtide, Methodist liturgy emphasizes charitable work and alleviating the suffering of the poor. This practice was last seen in The Book of Worship for Church and Home by The United Methodist Church, 1965, and The Book of Hymns, 1966. While some congregations and their pastors might still follow this old calendar, the Revised Common Lectionary, with its naming and numbering of Days in the Calendar of the Church Year, is used widely. However, congregations who strongly identify with their African American roots and tradition would not usually follow the Revised Common Lectionary. Adding more complexity to the mix, there are United Methodist congregations who orient their worship to the \\"free\\" church tradition, so particular liturgies are not observed. The United Methodist Book of Worship and The Hymns of the United Methodist Church are voluntarily followed in varying degrees. Such churches employ the liturgy and rituals therein as optional resources, but their use is not mandatory. Social principles and participation in movements From the movement's beginnings, with its roots in Wesleyan theology, Methodism has distinguished itself as a religious movement strongly tied to social issues. As father of the movement, John Wesley injected much of his own social philosophy into the movement as a whole. Wesley's personal social philosophy was characterized by \\"an instructive reluctance to criticize existing institutions [which] was overborne by indignation at certain abuses which cried out for rectification.\\"Camerona, Richard M. Methodism and Society. Vol. 1‚Äì3. Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1961. Print. The Methodist Church's responses to injustices in society are embodiments of the Wesleyan traditions of mercy and justice. At the end of the 19th- and beginning of the 20th-centuries, the Methodist Church responded strongly to what it regarded as social ills (e.g., gambling, use of intoxicating beverages, etc.) with attention to the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and perfection through Christ. In the United States, today's United Methodist Church continues to embody Methodist traditions in their response to social needs through the General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Global Ministries. In the United States, the United Methodist Church is the second-largest sponsor of Boy Scout units, with 11078 chartered units, representing over 370,000 youth members; by way of contrast, the LDS Church, which sponsors a total of 37,882 units - over three times as many - can boast a total youth membership of slightly over 420,000, only a 13.5% increase over the UMC's total.Boy Scouts of America http://www.scouting.org/About/FactSheets/operating_orgs.aspx Rejection of LGBT marriages and clergy \\"Methodists stand almost alone among mainline denominations in not performing same-sex marriages, in contrast to the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the United Church of Christ.\\" The United Methodist Church delegates met in St. Louis February 26, 2019, and voted 438 to 384 to maintain its policies defining marriage as a covenant between one man and one woman and barring \\"self-avowed practicing homosexuals\\" from serving as clergy. The plan made it easier to enforce penalties for violating the teaching, which is part of the church's Book of Discipline. Attitudes toward slavery Like most other national organizations, the Methodist Church experienced tensions and rifts over the slavery dispute. Both sides of the argument used the doctrines of the movement and scriptural evidence to support their case. The initial statement of the Methodist position on slavery was delivered in the Conference minutes from 1780's annual conference. After a comprehensive statement of the varied reasons slavery goes against \\"the laws of God, man, and nature,\\" the Conference answered in the affirmative to the question, \\"do we pass our disapprobation on all our friends who keep slaves and advise their freedom?\\" This position was put into action in 1783. Preachers from the Baltimore Conference were required, under threat of suspension, to free their slaves. By 1784, similar requirements were made of Methodists as a whole, laity and clergy alike. The negative reaction to this requirement was so strong that it had to be abandoned, but the rule was kept in the Book of Discipline. As slavery disputes intensified in the 19th century, there emerged two doctrines within the Methodist Church. Churches in the South were primarily proslavery, while northern churches started antislavery movements. The apologia of the Southern churches was largely based in Old Testament scriptures, which often represent slavery as a part of the natural order of things. New Testament writings were sometimes used to support the case for slavery as well. Some of the writings of Paul, especially in Ephesians, instruct slaves to remain obedient to their masters. Southern ideology also argued that slavery was beneficial for slaves, as well as their owners, saying that they were offered protections from many ills because of their slavery. The antislavery movement in northern churches strengthened and solidified in response to the pro-slavery apologia of Southern churches. Education of young people Sunday school at a Methodist church in Kentucky, 1946 The Methodist church has always been strongly oriented towards the religious lives of the young. In 1848, the General Conference stated, \\"when the Church has collected...a great population born within [her] bosom, she cannot fulfill her high mission unless she takes measure to prevent this population from being withdrawn from under her care in the period of its youth.\\" The first two American bishops of the Methodist Church, Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury, opened a preparatory school in Abingdon, Maryland in 1787. The school was a strict environment, with seven hours a day devoted to study. The venture ended when a fire destroyed the building in which the school was housed. In the 1870s, there was a broad movement toward incorporating Sunday schools into the doctrines of churches as a way to take ownership of the Christian education of children. This was the first great interdenominational movement the United States had ever seen. Methodists invested heavily in the cause of Christian education because of their emphasis on the child's right to and ability to \\"respond to divine influences from the beginning.\\" Beginning after World War II, the Methodist churches in the United States continued developing, at a much greater pace, ministries on Universities, Colleges, Junior Colleges and other higher education institutions, on campuses of both church-owned and state schools throughout the United States and Canada, and to a lesser degree in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Methodism boasts the largest number of higher education ministries, including teaching positions, of any Protestant denomination in the world in close competition with the Southern Baptist Convention. This emphasis is, in part, a reflection of the Methodist movement's earliest roots in The Oxford Holy Club, founded by John Wesley, his brother Charles, George Whitefield and others as a response to what they saw as the pervasive permissiveness and debauchery of Oxford University, and specifically Lincoln College when they attended. It is from the Holy Club that the earliest Methodist societies were formed and spread.United Methodist Board of Higher Education Ministries www.gbhem.org Temperance movement The temperance movement was the social concern which most broadly captured the interest and enthusiasm of the Methodist Church. The movement was strongly tied to John Wesley's theology and social principles. Wesley's abhorrence of alcohol use was taken up by American Methodists, many of whom were active and prominent leaders within the movement. The temperance movement appealed strongly to the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and Christian perfection. The Methodist presentation of sanctification includes the understanding that justification before God comes through faith. Therefore, those who believe are made new in Christ. The believer's response to this sanctification then is to uphold God's word in the world. A large part of this, especially in the late-19th century, was \\"to be their brother's keepers, or [...] their brother's brothers.\\"Agnew, Theodore L. The History of American Methodism: in three volumes. Volumes 1‚Äì3. Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1964. Print. Because of this sense of duty toward the other members of the church, many Methodists were personally temperate out of a hope that their restraint would give strength to their brothers. The Methodist stance against drinking was strongly stated in the Book of Discipline. Initially, the issue taken was limited to distilled liquors, but quickly evolved into teetotalism and Methodists were commonly known to abstain from all alcoholic beverages. In 1880, the general conference included in the Discipline a broad statement which included, \\"Temperance is a Christian virtue, Scripturally enjoined.\\" Due to the temperate stance of the church, the practice of Eucharist was altered ‚Äî to this day, Methodist churches most commonly use grape juice symbolically during Communion rather than wine. The Methodist church distinguished itself from many other denominations in their beliefs about state control of alcohol. Where many other denominations, including Roman Catholics, Protestant Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Unitarians, believed that the ill-effects of liquor should be controlled by self-discipline and individual restraint, Methodists believed that it was the duty of the government to enforce restrictions on the use of alcohol. In 1904, the Board of Temperance was created by the General Conference to help push the Temperance agenda. The women of the Methodist Church were strongly mobilized by the temperance movement. In 1879, a Methodist woman, Frances E. Willard, was voted to the presidency of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, an organization that was founded in December 1873, and was characterized by heavy Methodist participation. To this day, the Women's Division of the General Board of Global Missions holds property on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, which was built using funds provided by laypeople. Women of the church were responsible for 70% of the $650,000 it cost to construct the building in 1922. The building was intended to serve as the Methodist Church's social reform presence of the Hill. The Board of Temperance, Prohibition and Public Morals was especially prominent within the building.\\"The United Methodist Building.\\" General Board of Church and Society. Web. 24 November 2009.

","title":"History of Methodism in the United States"},{"id":"39158824","text":"The Amsterdam International Motor Show or AutoRAI was a motor show that took place every two years in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The history of the AutoRAI goes back to 1893, when the bicycle exhibition was established. The first RAI exhibition was organised there in 1895. History In 1900, the auto industry started to operate in the Netherlands and so the Association Bicycle & Automotive (RAI) was born. Prior to 1961, the RAI was situated in a building on the Ferdinand Bolstraat in Amsterdam (the 'Oude RAI') for forty years. In the 1970s through the 1990s, AutoRAI served an important function as a European event in a country with very little car industry of its own. Japanese manufacturers thus had a neutral ground (away from the spotlights of Geneva) where they could be expected to make their European premieres of cars already shown at home. The AutoRAI was usually held in February, giving the Japanese four months to develop European market models after the common October (Tokyo Motor Show) premieres of Japanese automobiles. AutoRAI 2013, which was scheduled to take place in April 2013, was cancelled. The organisers made the decision after consultation with the RAI Association and major car brand importers. The economic developments in the automotive sector had made it impossible to organise a fully-fledged event. The aforementioned parties said they would now focus on possible new setups of the event in the future. In addition to AutoRAI, the AutovakRAI 2013 was also cancelled for the same reasons. After a 2015 edition was organized, it was announced on August 31 2015 that the 2017 edition would be cancelled again due to insufficient space reservation by manufacturers. According to the RAI press release, it seems that they do not plan to organize any more AutoRAI events. 2011 * Audi Q3 * Burton Electric * Donkervoort D8 GT 24H of Dubai * ECE Qbee * Ford Focus 1.6 TDCi ECOnetic * Isis AM01 * Jaguar XF (facelift) * Landwind CV9 * Opel Astra GT * ≈†koda Octavia 1.4 TSI Greentech 2009 * Alfa Romeo MiTo Linea Rossa * Ford Focus X Road * Savage Rivale Roadyacht GTS * Westfield 1600 Sport Turbo 2007 * C,mm,n 2.0 Concept * Fiat Scudo Panorama Executive B2B Concept * Mercedes-Benz CL 65 AMG * Suzuki Grand Vitara Bandit Concept 2005 * Donkervoort D8 270 RS * Renault Laguna Hatchback * Wiesmann GT * MG TF * MG TF GT (Coupe) * MG SV 2003 * Mercedes-Benz E-Class Combi * Mercedes-Benz SL 600 * Opel Astra 1.3 CDTi * Smart City Coupe facelift * Toyota Yaris facelift * Toyota Yaris Verso facelift * Volkswagen Touran * Volvo S80 facelift 2001 * Mercedes-Benz C-Klasse Combi * Mercedes-Benz C-Klasse C 32 AMG * Mercedes-Benz SLK 32 AMG * Spyker C8 Laviolette * Suzuki Grand Vitara XL-7 1999 * Alfa Romeo 145 and 146 * Audi S3 * Chevrolet Alero * Daihatsu Gran Move * Opel Vectra * Porsche 911 GT2 * Renault Megane Break 1997 * BMW 5 Series Touring * Jeep Cherokee 2.5 TD * J√∂sse Car Indigo 3000 * Mazda 323P * Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class (C208) * Mitsubishi Galant 1995 * Daihatsu Cuore (export model premiere) * Daihatsu Valera * Ford Escort facelift * Ford Galaxy * Mitsubishi Carisma * Rover 100 facelift * Rover 600 620 Di * Suzuki Baleno 3-door * Volkswagen Sharan 1993 1993 was the largest Amsterdam show to date, with the original single hall now being the centre of a much bigger exhibition.

Genus The genus is native to Sri Lanka and India. The name Poecilotheria is derived from Greek: \\"poikilos\\", meaning spotted, and \\"therion\\", meaning wild beast. Discovery P. rajaei was officially described in a 2012 publication of the British Tarantula Society. It was discovered in 2009 when a villager brought a dead specimen to Ranil Nanayakkara, the co-founder of the Sri Lankan Biodiversity Education and Research organization, who was conducting an arachnid survey of Sri Lanka at the time. Description The spider has a leg span of up to , has vivid yellow and gray piping on the first and fourth legs with a pink abdominal band. It prefers to live in old-growth trees, but is considered rare due to deforestation in its war-torn habitat and has taken to living in old buildings. The venom of P. rajaei is not lethal to humans but can kill small rodents, birds, lizards and snakes. It is not yet known exactly how rare the newly discovered tarantula is, but there is some concern that habitat destruction is causing their number to dwindle. The species was named for Michael Rajakumar Purajah, the local police inspector who guided the research team while they searched for living specimens.

He also defended two titles in the same stroke (200 m) at the 2000 and 2001 European Junior Swimming Championships in Dunkerque, France, and in Valletta, Malta, respectively. Bodrogi is a former varsity swimmer for the USC Trojans under head coach Dave Salo, and a graduate of history and social sciences at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Bodrogi's Olympic debut came as the youngest male swimmer (aged 16) for the Hungarian squad at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, competing in two swimming events. In the 200 m butterfly, Bodrogi placed twenty-fourth on the morning prelims. Swimming in heat three, he edged out Greece's Ioannis Drymonakos to take a second spot by a hundredth of a second (0.01) in 2:00.74. In his second event, 200 m backstroke, Bodrogi was disqualified from the fourth heat for passing and breaching the 15-metre start line during the race. At the 2001 FINA World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Bodrogi cleared a two-minute barrier to lead a third fastest semifinal time and set a Hungarian record of 1:59.24 in the 200 m backstroke. Bodrogi swam only for the 200 m backstroke at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. He achieved a FINA A-standard of 2:00.13 from the national championships in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. He challenged seven other swimmers in heat four, including British duo James Goddard and Gregor Tait. He rounded out the field to last place by more than half a second (0.50) behind New Zealand's Cameron Gibson in 2:03.16.

It takes the form of a bow tied at the neck similar to those tied around the necks of kittens and cats. History While bows at the neck had been worn since at least the 19th century, the term \\"pussy cat bow\\" took hold in the 20th century. The lavalli√®re in 19th century France The lavalli√®re The lavalli√®re is a type of cravat similar to the bow tie that was popularly worn in the 19th century in France. It is of similar fashion to the bow tie, but has a larger knot and drooping ends. The length of the scarf can be up to long and is knotted in the same way as a bowtie, but forms two falling shells and two free ribbons. The name is associated with the Duchess of La Valli√®re (mistress of Louis XIV). It was primarily worn by women, artists, students, and intellectuals associated with the political left in 19th century France. 20th century In 1934, the St. Petersburg Times offered a pattern for an Anne Adams dress featuring a convertible collar which could be worn in four different ways, including as \\"an intriguingly feminine pussy cat bow tied high under your chin.\\" In 1947, pussy cat bows were part of the look inspired by Gibson Girls and 1890s fashions created by designers such as Omar Kiam. Certain western films of the 20th century employed the pussy bow as a clothing accessory for cowboy characters. Jack Lemmon as Frank Harris in the 1958 film, Cowboy, is one such example. By the 1960s, pussycat bows were a fixture in American fashion having been incorporated by top designers like Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. Meg Whitman, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett- Packard, explained in a documentary that women began wearing the lavalli√®re in place of a tie when entering the workforce in the 1960s. During the 1980s, the pussycat bow blouse became a key part of Margaret Thatcher's political image after she became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979, and became closely linked with her. Thatcher reportedly said she thought bows were \\"rather softening\\" and \\"pretty\\", and at her funeral in 2013, the then Prime Minister's wife paid tribute by wearing a pussycat bow blouse. The Thatcher look was imitated by other female politicians. 21st century During the 2016 US presidential election, Melania Trump wore a Gucci pussy bow blouse during the second presidential debate. This caused some to question if it was deliberate, coming just two days after her husband, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, was revealed to have spoken of being able to \\"grab them [women] by the pussy\\" in a video clip, which gained widespread attention and condemnation. Melania Trump wore a pussycat bow when discussing cyberbullying in August 2018, renewing speculation that she was trolling her husband. In 2018, women and men in Sweden took to wearing lavalli√®re in support of Sara Danius, who had resigned from the Swedish Academy for her handling of the aftermath of a sexual assault incident involving Jean-Claude Arnault.

Pellow's chronicles his many adventures spent during his 23-year-long captivity (summer 1715 ‚Äì July 1738) giving a detailed account of his capture by Barbary pirates, his experiences as a slave under Sultan Moulay Ismail, and his final escape from Morocco back to his Cornish origins. His captivity began at the age of eleven when sailing abroad in the summer of 1716 when his ship was attacked by Barbary pirates after crossing the Bay of Biscay traveling with his uncle, John Pellow, who was the ship's captain alongside five Englishmen. Pellow and his shipmates were taken captive and delivered to Sultan Moulay Ismail of Morocco as prisoners. Pellow was one of the individuals hand picked by the sultan along with three others and integrated into one of Ismail's many slaves.  Life as a Slave Thomas Pellow, after being pulled aside by the Sultan, was led into the armoury where he and others were tasked with cleaning the arms and cases belonging to the Sultan and his army, though he did not stay doing that for long as he was soon given by the emperor to his son, Muley Spha. Muley Spha was known to be an unsavoury individual and for giving his slaves futile tasks to perform, such as running morning to night after his (Muley Spha's) horse's heels. Then when Muley Spha noticed how bright Pellow was he, instead of beating him as was his custom, he tried to convince him to convert to Islam, promising him gifts and a better life as one of his esteemed friends. After all the bribes and temptations had been rejected, Muley Spha became infuriated and began to torture Pellow. \\"[He] committed me prisoner to one of his own rooms, keeping me there several months in irons, and every day most severely bastinading me.\\" Eventually, after weeks and weeks of horrendous torture, Pellow gave in and was forced to convert. After a time, Moulay Ismail ordered his son to bring Pellow so that he could go to school and learn the Moorish language. When Muley Spha disobeyed this order, he was summoned by the sultan and killed right before Pellow. With time, Moulay Ismail assigned Pellow into the 'Abid al-Bukhari'. According to Pellow‚Äôs text, white European converts could rise within the Moroccan military system, but were confined to their own separate fighting units. These units were generally much less important to Ismail‚Äôs government and military operations than their counterparts in the ‚ÄòAbid.  Marriage and Pellow  Throughout his narrative, Pellow only mentions his marriage a few times. Most of the writing we can see on his marriage comes from his detailing of the collective wedding where he received his wife as a reward from Moulay Ismail. He also mentions his wife's family and the status of his new brother-in-law shortly after he describes his wedding, but he references his wife and children only a few other times in the latter portions of his narrative. Ismail may have been marrying his slaves to reward them for their service, but he also would have benefitted from the enslaved children that would have resulted from enslaved marriages. Pellow never states that his wife was a slave, so we do not know if his children were born slaves. These marriages would have also made the prospect of escape more difficult for slaves who grew fond of their spouses, as these slaves would either need to abandon their spouses or risk increasing their visibility by escaping with at least one other person. Pellow never had to consider if he wanted to bring his wife and daughter with him when he successfully escaped, as they had both died while he was campaigning as a slave-soldier. In response to the news that his family was dead, he wrote ‚ÄúI thought them to be by far better off than they could have been in this troublesome World, especially this Part of it ; and I was really very glad that they were delivered out of it, and therefore it gave me very little uneasiness.\\"  Pellow as an elite slave  Thomas Pellow's extensive slave narrative The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow chronicles the captivity of a twelve-year-old Christian cabin boy and his development into an elite military slave during the reign of Moroccan Sultan Mulay Ismail. From the age 12, Pellow was plucked from preadolescence and placed on a rigorous track leading to his eventual military role as a preeminent captain in the Moroccan Army. Elite slaves like Thomas Pellow played an extraordinary role in the armed forces, often serving as soldiers and as officers, leading to the acquisition of important roles in administration, politics, and all aspects of public affairs. As part of this world, Pellow was only one of many European males who were taken and placed into military slavery. Pellow was part of a \\"band of European slaves mixed among other races that formed an elite army corps.\\" As one of these elite members, Pellow fought on the frontlines with ferocious proficiency, and his role in combat was primarily as an \\"infantryman.\\" Being that these slave soldiers were infantrymen, the monarchs viewed their role in their armies as ‚Äúan integral, perhaps a primary, part of the conquering Ottoman army.\\" However, despite their value, these soldiers were regulated as servile classes and \\"were not allowed to carry a sword, nor to carry an iron spear, these being distinctions of a free man, but slaves did carry some sort of weapon.\\" The only place these men would have carried a proper weapon was on the battlefield. Very soon after Pellow's Barbary capture and conversion to Islam, he goes on a forward track towards his elite slave stature. Pellow was educated to speak Arabic, as well as how to perform Moroccan social customs. From roughly the age of 12, Thomas Pellow was given the responsibility of managing 80 slave boys. Pellow excelled in his new position and eventually was transferred into the Palace to work as a personal attendant for Moulay Ismail's son, Mulai Zidan. Pellow's close proximity to the monarch's family exposed him to the many forms of capricious violence the Mulai family often employed. During his time there he witnessed the murder of Zidan, his favourite black slave, for disturbing two pigeons that Zidan was observing. His role as Zidan's personal attendant was a preparatory grooming technique that tested Pellow's ability to care for the monarch. Having a primary account of the wrath of Moulay Ismail no doubt prepared Pellow for witnessing the many capricious killings performed by the sultan. In the narrative, Pellow expresses the daily anxieties he was forced to live amongst as compared to how law is enforced in England. Pellow was considered a valuable slave. He was conditioned to live in constant fear of his life being ended at a moment's notice. This mental conditioning clearly compromised all relationships Pellow had with the Mulai family. Renowned slavery scholar Orlando Patterson describes Pellow's anxieties about master relations as follows: \\"No authentic human relationship was possible where violence was the ultimate sanction. There could be no trust, no genuine sympathy; and while a kind of love may sometimes have triumphed over this perverse form of interaction, intimacy was usually calculation, and sadomasochistic\\" (12). As Pellow became an adult, Ismail promoted him to a high status military position. Thomas Pellow was made an officer in the sultan's army and participated in three military campaigns. He led other slave-soldiers into battle and once took part in a slave- gathering expedition in sub-Saharan Africa. Pellow eventually fled Morocco by boarding an Irish ship and returned home in the summer of 1738.  Slave army  After being the personal slave for the Sultan's son, Pellow eventually joined the Sultan's army‚Äîan army that consisted almost entirely of slave- soldiers who had been captured as young children and indoctrinated. Pellow was made an officer in the slave army. Unlike all other military slaves, who spend their lives training for warhttp://www.danielpipes.org/448/military-slaves-a- uniquely-muslim-phenomenon, Pellow joined the sultan's army later in life. He led other slave-soldiers into battle and once took part in a slave-gathering expedition in sub-Saharan Africa. There was a stark difference between the independent renegades encountered in the narrative and their slave counterparts, ‚ÄúAs the mercenaries or allies, they retained their own loyalties, but as slaves, they could be subjected to reorientation. Prior to enrollment in the army, they were prepared for service; the government secured their loyalty and fitted their military skills to the needs of the army.‚Äù Unlike the free-thinking allies and mercenaries for hire, a slave‚Äôs life depended on their masters. They were trained to fight and forced into combat against their will. As such, the process of making them submissive to their masters was a long and arduous one by which they were beaten into shape and into a fearful loyalty to their masters. The alien soldiers were isolated figures whose isolation and alienation caused them to adopt what they were left with as normality. \\"He took them from their homeland to a strange country and cut them off from the rest of the society. They had no choice but to accept the affiliations provided them and to become loyal to him. They developed close relations with their comrades, all of whom shared a similar predicament.\\" These slaves were held on a tight leash and their indoctrination, while isolating, helped them to form what bonds that they could amongst themselves. As well as being kept in poor living conditions, they were also beaten. The emperor would say that he would do these cruel acts to the slaves to see if they were hard enough, if they were prepared to fight in his army. \\"Sometimes you would see forty or fifty of them all sprawling in their blood, none of them daring to rise till he left the place, where they were lying, and if they were discountenanced and out of heart at this usage, they were of a bastard-breed, and must turn out of his service\\" (4). Even after this type of treatment the soldiers were completely loyal to their emperor. The emperor would give them such incentives as distributing money among them to make them eager to march on expeditions they were ordered upon. To understand this reasoning for going outside of your country to form an army, one must appreciate that it was easy for the sultan to quickly gather armies among large populations and forcibly have their undying loyalty. Allen R. Meyers has written a paper that \\"describes the development of a slave army, the 'Abid al Bukhari, which enabled one such sultan, Ismail ibn al-Sharif, to establish a large and relatively durable Moroccan state\\" (3). Ismail created the slave army in an effort to \\"consolidate his power, to expand the kingdom, to suppress internal dissent, and to repulse the European and Ottoman threat\\". Meyers states that with the army's support, Ismail was able to collect taxes, suppress rebellion, and maintain public order. Ismail first created his army by confiscating three thousand male slaves from the residents of Marrakech, which he would later increase to around fifty thousand slaves, many of whom were part of a group of people called Haratins. Creating this self-sufficient army could also have its drawbacks, with uprisings and rebellions, such as a poor relationship with Islamic scholars due to his enslaving of fellow Muslims, an act that was considered to be blasphemous. On Pellow's return to Europe after his escape, he was met with misunderstanding and confusion, contrary to what some scholars seem to think. Pellow was no longer the English man that he remembered, and he was viewed suspiciously even before he arrived back on English soil. When his boat was travelling to port, he recalled, \\"I was denied by the Sentinels, telling me that till they had Orders for my so doing, they would not suffer any Moor to land: Moor! said I, you are very much mistaken in that, for I am as good a Christian (though I am dressed in the Moorish Garb) as any of you all\\" (4). Like other captives, Pellow found it hard to re-adjust on coming home. His overall appearance would have been so shocking that even his parents did not recognise him when he arrived. Still it is thought by some scholars that, \\"Under the circumstances, enslaved people in the Islamic lands had far greater opportunities for integration into mainstream society\\" (4). This being an obvious misunderstanding by the clear evidence that Pellow, a devout Christian and Englishman himself, had difficulties in proving his loyalty to his home country upon returning.  Pellow's Return Home  After his years as a slave had finally come to an end, Pellow was faced with the daunting task of finding his way home to Penryn, England. He managed to secure himself passage aboard a ship bound for Gibraltar but once the ship had docked, Pellow was forbidden to go ashore. Pellow's attire, tanned skin, and thick beard (which was considered a symbol of masculinity in Islamic culture), caused the harbor guards to mistake Pellow for a Moor, whom were not allowed to set foot upon English soil. Pellow called out to them to convince them he was as much a Christian man as them. The guards did not believe Pellow until his identity was at last verified. Once the confusion was cleared up, Pellow was able to leave the ship. While Pellow was still in Gibraltar he found himself being paranoid of being taken back to Morocco. A man named Mr. Abramico had been threatening to take Pellow back to Barbary. Pellow then physically assaulted Mr. Abramico in the street before some of his friends convinced him to stop the attack. A few days later he found himself a ship bound for London and managed to secure himself a ride. After his brief stint in London, Pellow made multiple trips to eventually find his way back to Penryn. Pellow found himself tormented by his twenty years of fighting, and upon his return he found great difficulty in acclimating back into English society. \\"Thomas Pellow had not just been captured by Barbary: he had in the process been changed. Irreversibly so, as it turned out, for he was never able to make a satisfactory life for himself on return to Britain.\\" Pellow's difficulty with reintegration is severely administered by his life in Barbary. Not only was he far from home, but he was indoctrinated into the Arab world and accepted his reality and their religion. Pellow's irreversible change was what made him an outsider, and made finding meaning in a place that was once his home impossible. \\"Pellow's inability to settle back in and make good, may have been due to more, however, than his own alienation. In his absence, not only he but his country had been transformed.\\" Pellow was a man with only one particular set of skills, and found himself was completely lost in a place that was once his home. The world at home was not the place he had once become accustomed to; instead, it was a place where he felt distant from and unable to relate to the people at home. Even when he spots his cousin during his escape, he chose to avoid him because he felt so distant due to his many years away from his people and his blood. \\"I looked sharp out for a vessel, but could not find anyone to my Mind; not but here were two, and one belonging to Joshua Bawden,‚Ä¶my first Cousin, we being Sisters Children; however, tho' I met him twice, and my Blood boiled in my Veins at the Sight of him, yet we did not speak on either Side, which was no doubt a very great Misfortune to me; for had he known who I was, he would, I am well satisfied, have carry'd me with him.\\" Pellow's disorientation and feeling of apprehension carried over into his arrival at his hometown of Penryn. Even though he was happy to be back in his homeland, Pellow admitted that everything was foreign to him. He did not recognize anyone. Not even his parents, who, in turn, only recognized him because they had heard of his impending return, were recognizable. (Pellow originally had a sister, though his narrative does not speak of her during the retelling of his homecoming. It is speculated that she may have died of fever years before. If Pellow had any other siblings born after his capture, the narrative does not say.) Pellow was treated as a returning hero of sorts, even given a celebration, but unfortunately the roles of his home countries had reversed. His native home had become a strange place to him and the land of his captivity had become more like home. References Further reading *Ali, Kecia. Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam.

The Trent Bridge Cricket Ground began in a field behind this pub, and the land was also the first home of the Notts County Football Club. The pub is now operated by Wetherspoons. History The Trent Bridge Inn in West Bridgford existed before there was a cricket ground. It was located just outside the walls of the city of Nottingham where travellers could stay whilst they waited to enter the city the following morning. The inn was owned by the Musters family who owned land in West Bridgford. At the time because of a different boundary the inn was in Nottingham, there was no licensed property at all in West Bridgford. The Inn in 1850 by Robert Bradley The inn was instrumental in creating the cricket ground which was set up in competition to the one owned by the town council. The first cricket match here was created by William Clarke in 1838 who was the captain of the Nottinghamshire cricket team. He had married Mary Chapman, the landlady of the Trent Bridge Inn, and they had arranged for the land behind the inn to be made available. (Generally land outside the city could not be built on until the law was changed in 1845). The Clarkes had the land cleared and a fence was erected. Matches were held here in preference to the former location within the city which had been used since 1835. The players were able to stay at the inn during the matches. The cricket matches did not attract large crowds and publican William Clarke experimented with other attractions. In 1845 Clarke decided to move to London to found the All England Eleven which became a nationally known touring cricket team. John Chapman who was Clarke's step son took over the management of the (pub and) ground for some time but he and his successor enjoyed no great success. 1861 saw the launch of the Easter Colts Trials where 22 players were invited to take on the first eleven in competition. This match was arranged by a local solicitor, John Johnson, who since 1859 had reinvigorated the club organising a committee and a first brick pavilion. The new match attracted audiences to see who was the best combined batter and bowler and of the first 22 contestants, seven went on to play first class cricket for Nottinghamshire. Richard Daft was a well known cricketer at Trent Bridge and he ran the inn at one time as he was a partner in the Radcliffe Brewery. He is remembered for captaining the club for ten years but he died a bankrupt in 1900. In 1883 the nearby land was also used by the Notts County Football Club who created a ground on the eastern side. However, by 1895 they were to move grounds regularly until they found their current home in 1910. At the end of the First World War the Musters family sold the Inn and the ground to the cricket club. The club only briefly owned the inn as they resold it to a brewery for a sum in excess of the money they had paid to the Musters. However the Inn was given the right to supply food to the ground in perpetuity. The pub was bought by Wetherspoons and a sum of 3 million pounds was spent in a refurbishment. It re-opened on 24 May 2011 and features four bars. Notable features On the outside of the building is a bench mark which records the pub's precise location.Flush Bracket S8785, bench-marks.org, accessed April 2013 References External links and sources * The Trent Bridge Inn, Nottingham at J D Wetherspoon Category:Pubs in Nottinghamshire Category:Buildings and structures in Nottinghamshire Category:Tourist attractions in Nottinghamshire Category:West Bridgford ","title":"Trent Bridge Inn"},{"id":"39158982","text":"The Pittsburgh Stock Exchange was a large regional stock market located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from November 11, 1864 (originally as Thurston's Oil Exchange) until closing on August 23, 1974. It was alternatively named the Pittsburgh Coal Exchange starting on May 27, 1870, and the Pittsburgh Oil Exchange on July 21, 1878 with 180 members. On July 25, 1896 the Exchange formally took the name Pittsburgh Stock Exchange though it had been referred to by that name since the spring of 1894. The Exchange, like many modern day exchanges, was forced to close during sharp economic crashes or crises. On December 24, 1969 The Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange bought the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange. At its height the exchange traded over 1,200 companies, but by the last trading day in 1974 only Pittsburgh Brewing Company, Williams & Company and Westinghouse remained listed. History Oil and Coal Exchange The Pittsburgh Stock Exchange was formed in 1864 as the \\"Oil Exchange.\\" The Pittsburgh Stock Exchange was originally Thurston's Oil Exchange, a large regional stock market located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania starting on November 11, 1864 on Fourth Street, downtown. The exchange was built on the oil traded at Pittsburgh during the Civil War with the creation of Thurston's Oil Exchange. It was alternatively named the Pittsburgh Coal Exchange starting on May 27, 1870, after the Pittsburgh Coal Exchange was chartered \\"for coal companies engaged in river transporation [sic?]\\" that January. The Coal Exchange changed its name to the Pittsburgh Oil Exchange in 1878. After many oil exchanges were being consolidated by Standard Oil, the exchange became known as the Pittsburgh Oil Exchange on July 21, 1878 with 180 members. Open for general stocks The Pittsburgh Coal Exchange opened for all general stocks by 1894, and in April 1894 the exchange began using the title Pittsburgh Stock Exchange. The exchange began officially operating under that name on July 25, 1896. The building of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange was destroyed in a fire on October 29, 1896. Closings The exchange was forced to close several times during sharp economic crashes or crises. October 23, 1907 it closed for three months due to the 1907 recession. During World War I the market closed for four months starting on July 31, 1914, due to economic effects of the war. With the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange closing that day, on March 5, 1933 President Roosevelt announced a bank holiday as both Mellon Financial and PNC Bank with the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange all left nervous account holders waiting outside locked doors. Final years On April 5, 1966 the New York Stock Exchange responded to the Regional Industrial Development Corporation's invitation to relocate to Pittsburgh, with the NYSE promising that the city was under consideration. On December 24, 1969 The Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange bought the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange with the commitment to keep the trading floor operational in the city, yet a national economic downturn and increased computerization and centralization led to the Exchange closing after trading ended at 3 PM on August 23, 1974. At its height the exchange traded over 1,200 companies but by the last trading day in 1974 only Pittsburgh Brewing Company, Williams & Company and Westinghouse remained listed. A total of 11 companies traded the last day with 3,100 shares. The stock exchange closed its Fourth Avenue \\"financial district\\" doors in August 1974 after computerization had consolidated trades in New York, Chicago and other global centers. Some academics posit the exchange closed due to an extended national bear market and increased computerization that would eventually centralize much regional stock market trading to New York City. Locations Pre-1903 location on Fourth Avenue From April 1, 1903 until October 1962 the stock exchange was located at 229 Fourth Avenue. From October 1962 until it closed in August 1974 it was located at the two-story 8,500 square foot structure at 333 Fourth Avenue. Prior to 1903 it was located in rented quarters of the Pittsburgh Bank for Savings on the corner of Fourth Avenue and Smithfield Street. After the exchange closed, the 1962-1974 structure was purchased by Point Park University on November 1, 2006 for $645,000. Executives John Baxter Barbour, Jr. (April 16, 1862-March 11, 1929) was president of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange for eight terms. Barbour was elected to membership in the Oil Exchange when he was nineteen years of age, and of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, was one of the organizers and a charter member. He became president in 1911. On May 3, 1916, was again elected president. For two terms he was treasurer of the Pittsburgh Petroleum, Stock and Metal Exchange. On June 7, 1936 Pittsburgh Stock Exchange secretary Paul Leitch died suddenly at 36 from a heart attack.

During his time in captivity, Pitts went through three masters over the course of more than fifteen years, with whom he travelled to Cairo and Alexandria. Though he escaped between the years 1693 and 1694, it was not until 1704 that Pitts first published his account. Pitts's A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, includes descriptions of his capture and captivity, including some of the first English descriptions of Islamic rituals.Pitts, Joseph. A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive (1704) reprinted in Piracy, Slavery, and Redemption: Barbary Captivity Narratives from Early Modern England, ed. Daniel J. Vitkus (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001), 218‚Äì340 Converting to Islam while a slave, Pitts was the first Englishman to record the proceedings of the hajj. Pitts also describes the people of seventeenth-century North Africa in detail, providing particulars on their manner of eating and dressing, the customs of their religion and marriage, and their economic and slave systems. Pitts's narrative was the first and most detailed description of Islam and the manners of Muslims written by a European during the seventeenth century.  Background  The narrative of Joseph Pitts was written during the time of the English Enlightenment. During the 17th century, the Enlightenment brought, following the Reformation, a renewed sense of religious identity among English philosophers, theorists, and theologians. One such instance was seen in the birth of the Unitarian movement. With the rise of deism among theological and philosophical circles, many began to accept the belief in a non-intervening creator of the world. As missionaries, seafarers, and traders traveled through the Ottoman Empire, contact with Muslims grew, and so did a new interest in foreign lands. With the new exposure to Arabic manuscripts and English captivity narratives, Enlightenment scholars began to gain an understanding of tawhid, the belief in the oneness of God. This notion largely appealed to anti-Trinitarian scholars of the time. Pilgrimage to Mecca During Pitts's time with his last master that he made his journey to Mecca to complete the hajj. Having converted to Islam under his second master, Ibrahim, Pitts departed for the hajj with his third master around 1685. His account described many aspects of the Islamic pilgrimage including the hajj caravans, the rites at Mecca, and the customary visit to Medina. Initial rites As a pilgrim, Pitts participated in the initial rites upon arriving in Mecca. This time is filled with the pilgrims' first tawaf, cleansing and drinking at the Zamzam Well, and completion of the sa'i. Today the sa'i is completed within the mosque in Mecca called Masjid al-Haram. During Pitts's time, and up until the 1950s, this was completed on the street.Inside Mecca. Dir. Taghi Amirani & Anisa Mehdi. National Geographic Television, 2003. DVD; Wolfe, Michael. One Thousand Roads to Mecca. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii‚Äìxxiii.  Mount Arafat  In chapter 7, Pitts says that they leave Mecca to visit ‚Äúa certain hill called Gibbel el orphat (or el-Arafat), i.e., the Mountain of Knowledge.‚Äù Here he witnesses the pilgrims perform wuquf at Arafat. It is the ‚Äúhow, when, and where [pilgrims] receive this honorable title of hajji for which they are at all this pains and expense,\\" Pitts states.Pitts, \\"A True and Faithful Account\\", Chapter 7. He describes the times that the pilgrims perform their preparations for the prayers and rites to be completed while at the hill, and how \\"they [beg] earnestly for the remission of their sins and [promise] newness of life using a form of penitential expressions and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours.\\"Pitts, A True and Faithful Account, Chapter 7.  Sexuality, women, and slavery in Pitts's narrative  Pitts does not often mention women in his writings and it appears there were very few opportunities for him to be around women. Pitts encounters violence against women several times in his account, most notably when describing the Imperial Turkish camps where he wrote that the soldiers are \\"apt to drink, and are abominably rude, insomuch that it is very dangerous for any woman to walk in any by-place but more dangerous for boys, for they are extremely given to sodomy‚Ä¶\\" In his discussion of marriage, Pitts describes how the marriage agreement takes place between the groom and the father of the bride. The woman's possible feelings or misgiving about the union are not mentioned at all. Pitts appears to perceive women as having little to no power in their relationships with men. He also discusses the idea of divorce and of Muslim men having multiple wives. According to Pitts, divorce is fairly common in the Islamic world and both parties are free to remarry afterwards. Multiple wives are not as common though; Pitts reports that very few men have multiple wives except out in the rural areas. Pitts touches on female power, but only from his perspective of interactions with the elite, and his background from England. Pitts details a visit to a slave market in Cairo while he is on the hajj with one of his masters. In the market place, Pitts observes the selling of women and men. While men are forced to act out tricks to show off their strength and abilities like a horse show, the women are treated in a different manner. Women would be dressed in fine clothing when being exposed in markets, in hopes of catching a buyer's eye. Pitts says that while the women's faces were veiled, men were allowed to freely view their faces, to feel the inside of their mouths and teeth, and to caress their breasts. If a woman's virginity was questioned, slave traders would sometimes permit a potential buyer to escort the she-slave into a private tent, allowing the customer to discover the answer to the question themselves. He notes that many of the slaves are women and children as the men are kept as rowing slaves aboard ships. He also describes many of the people as \\"Muscovites and Russians, and from those parts and some of the emperor of Germany's parts\\". These slaves have lighter skin, and they are dressed in fine clothing so they will fetch a higher price at auction. The slaves are examined much like animals; buyers are allowed to checked their teeth, muscles, and stature to get an idea of the overall health of a slave. Relationship with masters Pitts served a total of three masters, with varying degrees of treatment. While little insight is given into Pitts's first master, his second master, Ibrahim, treated him very poorly. At the beginning of Pitts' capture, he mentions the poor diet that he and the other slaves were fed. When planning a mutinous revolt, Pitts describes how the rebellion was discovered: the suspect of the uprising was brought forward in front of his fellow captives. Pitts states: ‚ÄòThe captain, with a great rope, gave him about an hundred blows on his buttocks, but he would not confess the fact, generously choosing rather to suffer himself than to bring us all under the bastinadoes also‚Äô. Many slaves watched as other saves where beaten and tortured. Pitts‚Äô narrative then turns to forced conversions to Islam. He states: ‚ÄòIt hath been affirmed by some that the slaves that are sold in this country are never compelled to turn to the Mohammetan religion.‚Äô Even after changing religions, Ibrahim treated Pitts just as maliciously as he had before, beating Pitts until he bleed. Pitts describes his third and final as master treating him like a son, seeing as he had no children or relatives and after given freedom, he continued to stay with him. From an Islamic context, freeing a slave was looked at as a great act of piety, and the act could allow the slave master to be forgiven of his sins. When Pitts made the decision to leave, escaping back to his native homeland, he became conflicted as to whether or not he should leave his fatherlike master who had made promises of leaving all of his belongings to Pitts after his death.  Controversy   Conversion  At the time period in which Pitts's narrative was written, many other writers of slave narratives were claiming, like Pitts, to have been forced into converting to Islam. Researchers have suggested that some claims were false, that North Africa was religiously more tolerant at this time. Christian captives who converted before returning to their native lands lied about having converted because the English Christians‚Äîtheir own families included‚Äîwould have persecuted them.Norton, Claire. \\"Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity: Narrations of Conversion and the Creation of the Early Modern Renegade.\\" Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East 29.2 (2009): 259‚Äì268. Project MUSE. Web. 1 March 2013. Researchers describe the way, in English theatre at this time, renegades were often considered to be on par with Satan-worshipers and atheists, and traitors to their countries.Matar, Nabil. \\"The Renegade in English Seventeenth-Century Imagination.\\" SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900. 33.3 (1993): 489‚Äì505; Clissold, Stephen. The Barbary Slaves. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86‚Äì101; Colley, Linda. Captives. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99‚Äì134. However other scholars do not question the idea of forced conversion, like author Robert Davis who in his article Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500-1800 details the abuse that European slaves suffered. He explains that if a slave is an embarrassment to his master, his master in return will punish him greatly, ‚Äúbeat a disappointing slave until the man was crippled or even killed. At least a dead slave could be quietly disposed of, without causing his master further embarrassment.‚Äù While Pitts does degrade Islam in part of his narrative, other times he claims that Christianity could learn from the devotion that Islam has. The relationship between religion and power is complicated. Freedom of religious practices in the Ottoman Empire were tolerated. ‚ÄúTolerance is based on a state of inequality in which the most powerful party (such as the ruler) decides whether a less powerful group can exist or not and to what extent members of that group are allowed to manifest their difference‚Äù In A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans Pitts expresses his relationship to Islam throughout his narrative. From the very beginning Pitts is hypercritical of Islam, but also subtly and not so subtly criticizes Christianity. The subtle and not so subtle criticism over both religions opens the reader to question Pitts true relationship to both religions. Pitts conversion to Islam happened early in his enslavement. Because he was forced to convert to Islam, he did not have the chance to fully assess what it meant to be a Muslim.  Physical abuse  There is controversy within the academic community as to the veracity of the abuse that Pitts, and many of his fellow captives, received at the hands of their masters. Many scholars cast doubt on Pitts's account. Claire Norton posits various reasons why beating a slave as a form of proselytization would have been illogical.Norton, Claire. \\"Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity.\\" A slave beaten into conversion would be of no economical value as Muslims were socially pressured to free their slaves once they converted. The Barbary Coast was also very egalitarian in its religious diversity, Christian services being held in various places, decreasing the likelihood that a Christian would have no place in Islamic society.

Shanti Stupa in Pokhara was built by Nipponzan-My≈çh≈çji monk Morioka Sonin with local supporters under the guidance of Nichidatsu Fujii, a Buddhist monk and the founder of Nipponzan- My≈çh≈çji. Shanti is a Sanskrit word meaning peace, also widely used in the Nepali and Hindi languages, and Shanti Stupa means Peace Pagoda. Shanti Stupa shrine was built as a symbol of peace. Situated at the height of 1100 meters on the Anadu Hill, Nichidatsu Fujii laid the foundation stone along with relics of the Buddha on 12 September 1973. Nepal has two of the eighty peace pagodas in the world: Shanti Stupa in Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha and Shanti Stupa in Pokhara. Shanti Stupa in Pokhara has also become a tourist attraction. It provides a panoramic view of the Annapurna range, Pokhara city and Fewa Lake. World Peace Pagoda, Pokhara Construction Nichidatsu Fujii planned to construct Peace Pagodas in 1947, in many locations around the world as a symbol of world peace. Nipponzan-My≈çh≈çji and locals of Pokhara built Shanti Stupa. Morioka Sonin, Dharmashilla Guruma (nun) and Min Bahadur Gurung were the key people in constructing the pagoda. During the construction of Shanti Stupa, workers were arrested several times by the Nepalese government for what was ultimately determined to be false accusations. Morioka Sonin took the initiative of building the Shanti Stupa in Pokhara. Dharmashilla Guruma of Dhamashilla Buddha Bihar, Pokhara was very positive about the proposal from Nipponzan-My≈çh≈çji and was involved in creating active participation from the locals in Pokhara. The statue of the first elected deputy defense minister, Min Bahadur Gurung, was placed in front of the Shanti Stupa to honor his land donation. On 28 November 1973, the prayer hall, with the statue of the Buddha, and the Guest House were set up. When construction of the pagoda had reached a height of thirty-five feet, Panchayati and the Royal Nepal government requested the destruction of the pagoda and adjacent buildings for security reasons. The building was not officially \\"passed\\" by the local government. Even though building the pagoda was off-limits, continuous support from Nipponzan-My≈çh≈çji, monks and local supporters allowed constant construction to continue. Nichidatsu Fujii had prophesied that one day the Shanti Stupa would be rebuilt. On 21 May 1992, after an eighteen-year uphill battle, the Honorable Girija Prasad Koirala came to the Anadu Hill and re-laid the foundation stone. Construction was completed without obstruction and the inaugural ceremony was conducted in the presence of the Chairman of the Nepali Congress Party and former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala on 30 October 1999. Statue of Buddha Buddha Statue at Shanti Stupa World Peace Pagoda / Shanti Stupa Pokhara Description and significance Shanti Stupa in Pokhara is the first World Peace Pagoda in Nepal and seventy-first pagoda built by Nipponzan-My≈çh≈çji in the world. The pagoda is 115 feet tall and 344 feet in diameter. The white pagoda has two tiers for tourists and religious visitors to circumambulate. The second tier displays four statues of the Buddha presented as a souvenirs from different countries: ‚ÄòDharmacakra Mudra‚Äô from Japan, ‚ÄòBodh Gaya‚Äô from Sri Lanka, ‚ÄòKushinagar‚Äô from Thailand and 'Lumbini' from Nepal. Each statue represents important events related to the Buddha and were named according to where they took place. Dharmachakra is placed below the gajur (pinnacle) which signifies the wheel of life, dharma and the teachings of the Buddha. The top of the golden gajur holds the crystal stone from Sri Lanka which symbolizes intellect and grace. Dhamma hall, with the Buddha statue, is located near the peace pagoda where Buddhist rituals take place daily and large pujas are performed on important dates according to the Lunar calendar, such as on full moon day. Fewa Lake and Himalayan Range seen from the Stupa Tourist attraction Standing on top of the Anadu Hill, Shanti Stupa adds beauty to the Pokhara Valley. It is a perfect holiday place providing a clear view of the Himalayan range, Fewa Lake and Pokhara city. The hilltop provides a splendid view of sunrise and sunset. TripAdvisor has ranked Shanti Stupa as the second top attraction in Pokhara. The pagoda is 7 kilometers from Mahendrapool, the major business spot in Pokhara. There are several ways to reach the peace pagoda. There are hiking trails, cycling tracks and the blacked topped road to the Stupa. One popular and adventurous hiking trail is the crossing of Fewa Lake by a local boat and then climbing uphill through local villages which takes about an hour. The partial black- topped road from Chhorepatan to the Stupa takes about 25 minutes, which can be reached by taxi or private car. Public transportation too is available to the Stupa.

The family traced its nobility back to ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá (1645‚Äì1711), who was created an Imperial Count in 1688. After his death, his title was passed on to his relative Jovan Brankoviƒá (1675‚Äì1734), who served as an officer in the Habsburg army in the Military Frontier, as did most of his male descendants. They participated in various wars waged by the Habsburgs. The last Count of Podgorica died in 1856, ending the male line of Jovan Brankoviƒá. Jovan Brankoviƒá ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá, born in 1645, was a Transylvanian Serb diplomat, writer, and self-proclaimed descendant of the medieval Serbian Brankoviƒá dynasty. In 1688, the Habsburg Emperor Leopold I created him an Imperial Count,Radoniƒá 1911, pp. 352‚Äì54 but had him arrested in 1689.Radoniƒá 1911, p. 396 From 1690 until his death in 1711, ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá lived as a captive in Vienna and Cheb. Since at least 1700, his personal attendant was his relative Jovan Brankoviƒá born in around 1675 in the Transylvanian town of Lipova.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 17‚Äì20Radoniƒá 1911, p. 534 The exact kinship relation between Jovan and ƒêorƒëe, who had no children, remains unclear. As Jovan was not a descendant of ƒêorƒëe, the latter's title could have been officially passed on to Jovan only through a special grant by the Habsburg emperor, but no document to that effect is known to have existed. Regardless of that, Jovan came to be tacitly recognized as a count.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 12‚Äì13 The old city hall of Sombor was originally Jovan Brankoviƒá's mansion, whose south-eastern part is still preserved in the modern-day building. After ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá's death in 1711, Jovan Brankoviƒá joined the Serbian Militia, a unit of the Habsburg army that was mostly active in the Military Frontier of the empire. He distinguished himself in battles with the Ottomans and rose through the army ranks. In 1717 he was appointed commander of the city of Sombor. He was first mentioned as a count in the Treaty of Passarowitz, signed in 1718 between the Ottomans and the Habsburgs. In the same year, Jovan began to build his mansion, which would be turned into the city hall of Sombor in 1749. The south-eastern part of the mansion is still preserved in the modern-day building.Janju≈°eviƒá 2010, p. 104 Jovan married Marija of the Kostiƒá family, with whom he had a daughter, Jelena, born in 1721, and two sons: Nikola born in 1729, and Jovan born in 1733. Jovan senior died of an illness in 1734.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 24‚Äì26 Jovan Brankoviƒá's children The daughter of Jovan Brankoviƒá, Jelena, married ƒêorƒëe ƒåarnojeviƒá from Futog, who was an adopted son of Mihajlo ƒåarnojeviƒá, Count of Maƒçva. Jovan's widow, Marija, moved in 1749 with her sons to the village of Boljevci near Zemun. In December of the same year, her eldest son Nikola joined the Syrmian Hussar Regiment, with which he participated in the Seven Years' War. Nikola married Ana of the Putnik noble family. Mojsije Putnik, the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitan of Karlovci, and Avram Putnik, a general in the Habsburg army, were Ana's uncles.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 27‚Äì29 In 1766, Ana and Nikola moved from Boljevci to the nearby village of Ugrinovci. They had six sons and three daughters; their third son, Petar, died at an early age. After his hussar regiment was disbanded in 1786, Nikola was transferred to the Petrovaradin Infantry Regiment, and given the rank of captain first class. He retired in 1800, after fifty years of active service in the Habsburg army. Nikola died in Ugrinovci in 1804. The second son of Jovan Brankoviƒá from Lipova, also named Jovan, joined at the age of sixteen the Syrmian Hussar Regiment, together with his brother Nikola. Jovan participated in several wars, including the Seven Years' War and the War of Bavarian Succession. He married in 1763 and had three children: the daughters Pulherija and Jelisaveta, and the son Mihajlo. Jovan suddenly died at the age of 54, in 1787, three years after his wife's death. His minor children were adopted by their uncle Nikola. Jovan was posthumously promoted to the rank of major.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 43‚Äì45 Jovan Brankoviƒá's grandchildren The first son of Nikola Brankoviƒá, ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá, was born at the beginning of 1766. His army career started in 1784 in the Petrovaradin Regiment. Afterwards, he served in several units of the Habsurg army, including the Serbian Freikorps, and the Slunj, Brod, and Gradi≈°ka Regiments. He retired in 1824 in the rank of colonel, the highest rank obtained by any of the Brankoviƒás. Army documents describe ƒêorƒëe as a courageous and deserving officer who participated in sixteen wars. He never married and had no children. After his retirement, ƒêorƒëe lived in Karlovac, Novi Sad, and Laƒáarak, where he died in 1830.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 29‚Äì30 Nikola's second son, Dimitrije Brankoviƒá, was born on 19 October 1770. In 1788 he joined the Serbian Freikorps together with his older brother; he later served in the Petrovaradin Regiment. He was promoted to the rank of captain first class in 1804, the year when the First Serbian Uprising began in the Ottoman- held Serbia. The leader of the uprising, Karaƒëorƒëe, had also served in the Serbian Freikorps, and Dimitrije was acquainted with him. General Geneyne, the commander of the Slavonian Military Frontier, appointed Dimitrije as his liaison officer with influential Serbs in the empire, and, through them, with the insurgents in Serbia. In 1805, however, Dimitrije requested and received a discharge from the army. In the same year he married Marija, a rich and young widow in the town of Karlovci. She died next year giving birth, eighteen days before her newborn child died. Dimitrije soon entered his second marriage, which was childless. He was regarded as the most prominent of the six noblemen in Karlovci at the beginning of the 19th century. He died in 1836.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 30‚Äì34 Nikola's fourth son, Stefan Brankoviƒá, was born on 17 November 1777. Stefan joined the Petrovaradin Regiment when he was nineteen. He participated in all Napoleonic Wars, but he slowly rose through the ranks, retiring in 1838 in the rank of major. He was a representative at the Serbian National Congress held in 1842 in Karlovci for the purpose of electing the new Metropolitan of Karlovci. Josif Rajaƒçiƒá was then elected, though Stefan voted for another candidate. His wife, Jelena, was the hostess of the Serbian ball held in 1844 in Novi Sad. Stefan died childless in 1852, and his wife died in 1859 as the last Countess of Podgorica.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 35‚Äì36 Nikola's fifth son, Pavle Brankoviƒá, was born on 5 March 1780. He became a soldier in 1799 and participated in Napoleonic Wars, serving in the Petrovaradin, Lika, and Brod Regiments. On 28 June 1815, Pavle and the companies under his command successfully defended a bridge on the Arly River at the town of Conflans in Savoie, France. For this feat, the Habsburgs awarded him the Knight's Cross; he later received two more decorations. He was the commander of a district of the Military Frontier in Lika, before he retired in 1843 in the rank of lieutenant colonel. He and his wife Ana then moved to Timi»ôoara, and later to Novi Sad. Ana and Pavle had only one child, a daughter who died young. Several years after his retirement, Pavle became blind. He died on 11 July 1856 in Novi Sad as the last Count of Podgorica, ending the male line of Jovan Brankoviƒá from Lipova. His funeral was conducted by Bishop Platon Atanackoviƒá with the participation of numerous priests and an honorary military escort consisting of a battalion of the Petrovaradin Regiment.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 36‚Äì39 Nikola's sixth and youngest son, Avram Brankoviƒá, was born on 21 February 1782. He studied law in Budapest, which he finished in 1804. He became a Serbian Orthodox cleric and taught at the recently established Theology Faculty in Karlovci. At that time, he was one of only two teachers at the faculty, the other being Lukijan Mu≈°icki. Avram became a monk and took the monastic name of Antonije. Stefan Stratimiroviƒá, the Metropolitan of Karlovci, entrusted Antonije with various tasks. In 1819 Antonije was appointed the archimandrite of the Grgeteg Monastery, and in 1824 he became the Bishop of Pakrac. He was regarded as the most likely successor to Metropolitan Stratimiroviƒá. However, he suddenly died in 1824, at the age of 42.ƒåuljak 1998, pp. 39‚Äì42 After Jovan Brankoviƒá junior's death, his children were adopted by their uncle Nikola. The eldest, Pulherija, married in 1792 Jeftimije Noviƒá from Krƒçedin, an officer in the Petrovaradin Regiment. He would be given a nobility rank in 1812 by the Habsburg Emperor Francis I. Descendants of Pulherija and Jeftimije lived in 1998 in Novi Sad and Belgrade. As for Pulherija's siblings, Jelisaveta and Mihajlo, neither of them married or had children. Mihajlo graduated from a military academy in 1800, and he was immediately sent to a war. He retired in 1829 in the rank of captain. He lived in Slavonski Brod, where he died in 1854.

It was developed jointly by Acquire and Class of Heroes developer ZeroDiv, and published by GungHo Online Entertainment. It was released in Japan on August 1, 2013, and in May 2014 in Europe and North America by Aksys Games.  Gameplay  The premise of the game has received many comparisons to the Persona series of role-playing video games. The game's dialogue is fully voiced and takes place in 2D, similar to that of a visual novel, while the game's battle system consists of 3D computer graphics and turn-based battles.  Story  The game takes place in two different \\"worlds\\"; the real world, and a \\"crazy spiritual world\\". The real world aspect of the game is set in Japan, in the regions Akihabara, Yokohama, Amamiya and Nippori. Specifically, the game takes place in the Saitama Prefecture. The story is simple, revolving around a high school student, Kei Takanashi, and a group of other high school students who stumble into the outer realm, and begin battling other MINDS and MIND Users to help protect and save people.  Development  The game was first announced in March 2013 in an issue of Famitsu. It was announced to be in development jointly by Acquire and Class of Heroes developer ZeroDiv. As of announcement, the game was reported to be 70% complete. The game was scheduled for release in August 1, 2013 in Japan, and was the first game released by publisher GungHo Online Entertainment since buying out Acquire in 2012. After the existence of a pre- order spot for the game was noted at websites such as GameStop in January 2014,http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2014/1148.html Aksys Games formally announced the game for a physical and digital release in North America, and a digital- only release in Europe, on the 30th of January. The game was later greenlithttp://shinigamilist.com/2014/09/10/mind-zero-dungeon-crawler- greenlit-via-steam-games/ via the Steam Greenlight voting system and is now available for PC via Steam.  Reception  Upon release, Mind Zero has received mixed reception. Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5, saying \\"For a game without any kind of established lineage, this is a very welcome addition to the Vita‚Äôs growing JRPG library.\\", whereas IGN gave Mind Zero a 7/10, praising the title for its battle system and voice acting but criticized it for repetitive dungeons and poor writing. GameSpot was much more critical with a 4.0/10, citing repetitive gameplay and that the game \\"fails at anything beyond being occasionally mediocre.\\". HonestGamers later reviewed the PC version released through Steam and, amongst over things, criticized it for being a low quality port from the Vita.

The actress was travelling through Kakadu with her boyfriend when she received a call from her agent about a regular role on Neighbours. Hampele was then asked to film an audition for the show and she said that she could not turn down the opportunity to play Georgia. She also believed that she was meant to get the part because the character was originally called Daisy, a nickname her boyfriend and friends call her. Hampele made her first screen appearance as Georgia during the episode broadcast on 5 October 2012. Hampele decided to leave the show in 2015 to pursue new acting opportunities, and Georgia made her departure in the same month. She later returned for guest appearances in August 2015 and April 2016. Georgia was introduced to Neighbours as the cousin of established character Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and she soon moved in with him and his partner, Sonya (Eve Morey). Georgia is a graduate nurse from the country. Hampele stated that she is a positive person, while writers for TV Week and Soap World described her as being \\"bubbly\\" and \\"vivacious\\". When Georgia's childhood sweetheart, Scotty Boland (Rhys Uhlich), was introduced, she began questioning their relationship after developing feelings for Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). After Georgia learned that Scotty was gay, she went on a downward spiral and briefly lost her job at the hospital due to a drugs scandal. Georgia later became engaged to Kyle, developed a singing career, had a miscarriage and a cancer scare. Casting On 1 August 2012, it was announced that Hampele had joined the cast of Neighbours as Georgia Brooks, the cousin of established character, Toadfish Rebecchi (played by Ryan Moloney). While travelling with her boyfriend, Kayne Tremills, in Kakadu, Hampele received a call from her agent about a regular role on Neighbours. She was asked to record \\"an impromptu audition\\" for the show's producers and the actress noted that the Australian outback featured in the backdrop of her video was \\"a far cry from Ramsay Street\\". Hampele revealed that she could not turn down the opportunity to play Georgia and work in Melbourne, following a stint auditioning for shows in Los Angeles. The actress thought that she was meant to get the part because the character was originally named Daisy, a nickname Tremills and her friends have given her. Hampele later told Erin McWhirter from TV Week that after a few weeks of filming, she felt part of the Neighbours family and she took an instant liking to Moloney. She explained \\"Ryan is absolutely lovely and I think because I came into the show as family. I took an instant liking to him and see him as an older brother. He's been able to show me the ropes a little bit.\\" A day before she appeared on-screen, a video featuring Hampele receiving a tour of Erinsborough from cast members Alan Fletcher and Jackie Woodburne (Karl and Susan Kennedy) was released. Hampele made her first appearance as Georgia during the episode broadcast on 5 October 2012. Development Characterisation Moloney told a writer from MSN that Georgia would \\"stir things up\\" in Toadie's household. Shortly after she arrived, Georgia moved in with her cousin and his then pregnant partner, Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey). Moloney quipped that she was another mouth to feed and the house was becoming a bit full what with the baby arriving too. Of how Georgia fits in, the actor explained \\"It looks as though she's annoying Sonya and she's going to be a bit of a pain in the neck, but then Sonya and her get on like a house on fire and it backfires on Toadie. He's stuck with someone who agrees with Sonya's hippy birthing ways. But it's lovely to have another member of the family on the street.\\" A writer for Channel 5's Neighbours website also stated that as the cousin of Toadie, Georgia already had an established bloodline coming into the show. McWhirter revealed that Georgia is a graduate nurse and described her as being \\"bubbly\\", while a Soap World columnist called her \\"vivacious\\". Georgia is also a country girl. Hampele thought her character was a positive person and hoped that whatever happens during her storylines, she would not change completely. Hampele later commented that she enjoyed playing Georgia, explaining \\"life keeps throwing some pretty heavy stuff her way, but she always maintains her integrity and optimism, even if it gets challenged along the way. She's a great role model - she's caring, loving, naive - but can also be strong, independent and fearless when she needs to be.\\" The actress added that Georgia is the type of person she would befriend. Love triangle Georgia's childhood sweetheart, Scotty Boland (Rhys Uhlich), was introduced in December 2012. Scotty is a country farmer who decides to follow Georgia to Erinsborough. David Knox from TV Tonight commented that Scotty was \\"not impressed\\" that his girlfriend had left Birregurra. Georgia is happy to see Scotty, but starts to realise that they have less in common with each other that she first thought. Georgia then questions her relationship with Scotty when he fails to understand why her work is having an emotional impact on her. Instead Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) gives Georgia the support she needs, leaving her with some questions about her future with Scotty. Georgia become torn between Kyle and Scotty. When she decides to spend the afternoon at a fundraising barbecue with Kyle, Georgia starts to feel guilty about ditching Scotty for the day and quickly leaves. Hampele told an Inside Soap columnist, \\"Kyle has definitely been a distraction for Georgia. She and Kyle spend the afternoon together raising funds for baby Patrick, and Georgia has a great time. That's when she realises there's an attraction.\\" Georgia's hasty exit from the fundraiser causes Kyle to become confused and he thinks she has developed a crush on Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber). Kyle believes that Georgia's feelings for Rhys will lead her to have her heart broken and he urges her to mend her relationship with Scotty, which leaves Georgia \\"gutted\\". Hampele quipped that Georgia likes Kyle and she thinks he feels the same way, so it comes as a blow to her. The actress continued that Georgia has been brought up to stand by her man, so her feelings about Scotty are conflicted. Kyle's grandmother later tells Rhys that Georgia fancies him, so he decides her to ask her out. However, a \\"bewildered\\" Georgia turns him down. Georgia and Kyle continue to hide their feelings for each other, but Georgia struggles to contain her jealously when Kyle begins dating Jana Noviac (Kyrie Capri). Georgia realises that her feelings for Kyle mean that her relationship with Scotty is over and she breaks up with him over the phone. When Kyle comes over to Georgia's place to fix the pool, she offers to put some sunscreen on his back and TV Week's Thomas Mitchell declared that \\"the electricity is off the grid!\\". However, Georgia's aunt, Angie Rebecchi (Lesley Baker), interrupts them. Milligan said \\"Kyle and Georgia have that sexual tension. They both know deep down that they have feelings for each other but something just isn't working in their favour yet.\\" Georgia and Scotty later get back together and Scotty comes to stay with her on Ramsay Street. Georgia is grateful when Scotty appears unaware of her attraction to Kyle. When Scotty suddenly proposes to Georgia, she accepts. She also scolds Kyle for being jealous when Scotty informs her that Kyle has been \\"mistreating\\" him. Scotty and Georgia plan to elope in secret, but before they can leave, Kyle reveals that Scotty made sexual advances towards Chris Pappas (James Mason). Georgia is initially unwilling to believe the story, until Scotty confirms he is gay. A Soap World columnist noted \\"Georgia is shattered to think that she missed all the signs throughout their eight-year relationship\\". Georgia is hurt further when Scotty abruptly leaves town without saying goodbye. Hampele revealed that Georgia cannot believe her first serious relationship has ended this way and she is frustrated that she did not get a chance to confront Scotty because his letter did not provide the answers that she needs. Georgia has also been left feeling like she was not good enough for Scotty and she becomes angry about that. Hampele added that moving forward, Georgia and Kyle would be a good match as they share similar outlooks on life and are both \\"a little kooky.\\" Downward spiral In April 2013, it was announced that Georgia would become involved in a drugs scandal storyline. Following the revelation about Scotty's sexuality, Georgia goes on \\"a downward spiral\\" which begins affecting her personal and professional life. She swears off any future relationships with men and rejects her friend's attempts to console her. A Soap World reporter wrote that Georgia is \\"ashamed to be around anyone who knows her.\\" Georgia avoids her own birthday celebrations and when she is treating Pete Clark (Paul Cousins) at the hospital, she is unaware that he is flirting with her. However, when she realises that Pete is interested in her, Georgia decides to go for a drink with him. When Pete rejects her kiss, she becomes even more embarrassed and starts suffering from insomnia. Georgia asks Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) for some strong sleeping pills, but her behaviour concerns him and he later organises for Georgia to have some time off work. While she is at Charlie's, a conversation with Pete takes \\"a dark and potentially dangerous turn\\" when he offers her some drugs. Georgia accepts the pills as she wants to forget her problems and she enjoys a night of hard partying. When asked how she felt about the storyline, Hampele replied that she enjoyed it, especially as it meant that she got to explore another layer of her character's personality. When some drugs go missing from the hospital, Georgia is wrongly accused of taking them as she is responsible for the drug store. She realises that she left Pete alone with the keys to the store when he came into the hospital again, but struggles to admit that to anyone. During a search of Georgia's bag, sleeping pill prescriptions are found and she suspects Pete had something to do with them. When Georgia is forced to reveal the truth about her own drug use, she is shocked and devastated when she is fired from the hospital. Hampele told Kilkelly \\"It's going to be extremely difficult for her to get her job back, because it appears initially that she has broken every rule in the book. However, I think she has only touched the surface as a nurse and hospital settings provide some of the most interesting storylines, so I would definitely like to see her remain as a nurse.\\" Kyle helps Georgia to clear her name when he finds the person behind the drugs theft. Georgia's reputation is restored and she is allowed to return to work. Relationship with Kyle Canning Once Georgia's life settles down, she and Kyle start spending \\"quality time\\" with each other. When they believe their relationship is in a good place, Georgia and Kyle have sex for the first time. However, their happiness does not last for long when Georgia is offered an opportunity to work overseas. Milligan commented \\"Just when Kyle thinks they're making progress, Georgia springs this on him. He tried the long-distance thing with his ex, Jade, and it didn't work.\\" As Georgia begins to struggle in the relationship, she breaks up with Kyle. He then realises that she needs to work through her issues with Scotty before she can truly move on and invites Scotty back to town. Georgia is shocked when Scotty turns up on her doorstep and Kyle leaves them alone to talk. The talk with Scotty helps Georgia to overcome her insecurities and she and Kyle make up. Not long after Scotty's visit, Georgia and Kyle face their next challenge when Kyle is temporarily blinded during an eclipse. Hampele stated \\"Georgia has self-esteem issues because of her break- up with Scotty. Even though Kyle always tries to be there for her, she just keeps pushing him away. And then Kyle has this terrible accident and that puts a massive strain on both of them.\\" Hampele said the scenes between Georgia and Kyle were challenging to film as she and Milligan could not make eye contact. She also found it difficult to have an \\"emotional response\\" with Milligan. Georgia and Kyle's relationship becomes so strained that they decide to take a break. Kyle then has a one-night stand with Georgia's best friend Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Hampele admitted that she would have preferred Georgia and Kyle to have been happy and stable in their relationship for a bit longer, before it is tested again. Georgia and Kyle become engaged when they both propose. Hampele told an Inside Soap reporter that as Georgia is an impulsive character, she thought it was perfect that she made the snap decision to propose to Kyle. However, instead of accepting straight away, Kyle leaves Georgia to go and get his grandmother's ring, so he can propose to her. Georgia's cousin Gemma Reeves (Kathryn Beck) discovers Kate and Kyle's affair after hacking into Kate's email account and finding an unsent email from Kate to Kyle detailing their one-night stand. She places the email in a pile of congratulatory email messages at an engagement party thrown for Georgia and Kyle. Georgia then reads out the email from Kate. Realising that her best friend and boyfriend have betrayed her, a heartbroken Georgia flees the party. Hampele admitted that she was \\"a bit devastated\\" that the affair was revealed as she realised that she would not get to work with Brewer and Milligan as much in the future. Hampele also thought about how Georgia does not see Gemma's manipulation of her and put it down to Beck, who convinced her that nothing bad was happening in the background. Hampele explained that Georgia is devastated and shocked by Kate and Kyle's betrayal. She does not give them a chance to explain and is unsure whether they are even still continuing the affair. Georgia is \\"equally angry at them both\\" and decides to cut them out of her life. Singing career During an appearance on The Wright Stuff in May 2013 Hampele revealed that Georgia would be doing some singing in the show. She added that Georgia would perform with Karl's band The Right Prescription. Hampele found the singing storyline to be \\"quite challenging\\" and it was not something that she pushed. However, the producers received positive feedback and they continued to show Georgia singing. Georgia later writes and records a song called \\"Letting You Know\\", about her relationship with Kyle. Hampele got to record the song in real-life and it was later available to download. Singer and songwriter Amali Ward was introduced to the show as part of the storyline. With the drama between Georgia and Kyle, the storyline died down. Pregnancy In December 2013, a reporter for the Press Association announced that Georgia would be shocked to learn that she was pregnant with Kyle's child in the new year. The reporter added that Georgia would \\"struggle\\" with telling Kyle her news. While she is recovering from her heartbreak over Kate and Kyle, Georgia was \\"plagued with ill health\\", which she put down to stress. After taking a pregnancy test, which turned out to be positive, Georgia had mixed emotions. Hampele explained \\"Georgia is someone who's always wanted children, marriage and a home. She's always imagined Kyle would be the person she would do all those things with.\\" Georgia initially decided to keep her pregnancy from Kyle because she felt that she could not trust him. While suffering from severe morning sickness, Georgia collapsed during a gig at Charlie's, leading to Kyle discovering that she was pregnant. After keeping her distance from Kyle, Georgia began to \\"thaw\\" towards him and Hampele commented that it was because of her \\"hopeless romantic\\" side. However, when Georgia experienced some unusual pain and cramps, Kyle took her to the hospital and they learned that Georgia had suffered a miscarriage. Georgia and Kyle were \\"shattered\\" by the news and Hampele pointed out, \\"It's such a devastating loss. This baby was something they were really looking forward to.\\" Cancer scare In August 2014, Georgia experienced a cancer scare. After she developed a sore throat, she got it checked out by Karl, who found a large lump. Georgia became concerned as there is a history of lung and throat cancer in her family. Georgia struggled to acknowledge the possibility of cancer and Hampele said, \\"It's very devastating for her. One of her biggest concerns is the thought of leaving Kyle behind. Also, she knows how much her mum's cancer diagnosis rocked her family.\\" Kyle assured Georgia that she would be fine and persuaded her to have the surgery to remove the lump. Ahead of her surgery, Georgia began to feel nervous and wondered whether she was doing the right thing by having the lump removed. Hampele told an Inside Soap columnist that Georgia was nervous and worried about permanently losing her voice. Georgia's surgery appeared to go well, but while she was in recovery, her health took a turn for the worse. Hampele explained, \\"when Georgia comes out of surgery, she can still talk, but she's told not to overuse her voice. However, the stitches in her throat rupture and she starts coughing up blood.\\" Georgia was rushed back into theatre to repair her stitches and Karl tried to reassure her that everything would be okay. However, he later had to inform Georgia that she would probably not sing professionally again. Georgia then suspected that there might have been some misconduct from her surgeon Jessica Girdwood (Glenda Linscott) and when she realised Karl and Jessica were friends, she questioned whether Karl was covering up for his colleague. Departure On 18 May 2015, it was confirmed that Hampele had left Neighbours and had filmed her final scenes earlier in the year. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that the actress had moved to Los Angeles to pursue new career opportunities. Hampele later said that Georgia had been \\"a pleasure to play\\" and she was thankful for all the messages from fans expressing their love and support for her. Georgia's exit storyline saw her move to Germany with her mother, who had been diagnosed with cancer. Georgia found a research centre in the country that offered an effective treatment for the disease. Georgia departed Erinsborough after \\"an impromptu farewell\\" with Kyle and her friends on 27 May. Two months later, it was revealed that Hampele had filmed some extra scenes which had yet to air. Georgia appeared via an online video call to Kyle. She later returned home, shortly after a man called Greg Keys (Ryan Faucett) revealed to Kyle that he was in love with her. A show spokesperson stated, \\"Kyle is on tenterhooks when Georgia finally arrives. She reassures him nothing physical happened between Greg and herself but admits there was a connection and asks to be set free.\\" Hampele later reprised her role to facilitate Milligan's exit from Neighbours. Speaking to a writer for the show's official website, Hampele said it was \\"a bit surreal\\" coming back to the set, but she enjoyed see the cast and crew again. When asked if Georgia and Kyle should be together, she said \\"They are so compatible and even after all of the struggles they have been through they always seemed to make sense together. It's been an amazing journey seeing them grow and mature as a couple, and it feels like the right outcome to have them live happily ever after...but who knows?\\" Georgia returned on 4 April 2016. Storylines Georgia comes to Erinsborough after getting a nursing job at the local hospital. She moves in with her cousin Toadie and his family on Ramsay Street. Georgia befriends Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) helps to organise a bush dance for the school formal, befriending Kyle Canning in the process. Karl Kennedy reprimands Georgia for not filing paperwork correctly and gives her some files to sort through. Georgia comes across a patient file that contains few details and learns that her colleague, Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley), created a fake file for Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Aidan asks Georgia not to reveal what he has done, but she tells Karl and Aidan is suspended. Georgia's boyfriend, Scotty, arrives and becomes jealous of her friendship with Kyle. Georgia notices that a newborn Patrick Villante (Lucas MacFarlane) has a heart problem and she struggles with the emotional impact of her job. When Scotty fails to support her, she becomes closer to Kyle. His grandmother, Sheila (Colette Mann), tries to discourage Georgia's crush on him. Georgia breaks up with Scotty, but soon learns Kyle is dating someone else. Georgia organises a charity camp out for the hospital and when Scotty asks her to try again, she agrees. Georgia later accepts Scotty's marriage proposal. But before they can elope, Kyle informs Georgia that Scotty made sexual advances towards Chris Pappas. Scotty does not deny Kyle's accusations and he flees Erinsborough, leaving a brief written apology behind. Georgia works extra shifts at the hospital and tries to avoid Chris. She is also prescribed some sleeping pills by Karl. Georgia goes for a drink with her patient Pete Clark. Pete later gives Georgia drugs and she spends the night partying with him. Georgia realises that her new lifestyle does not suit her and tells Pete that they can no longer be friends. When Georgia leaves the keys to the drugs store unattended, some medication goes missing and Georgia is fired. At the same time, Georgia and Kyle enjoy a romantic date and he helps her to clear her name, after he finds a student selling the drugs. Georgia's job is reinstated when it emerges that the student's mother, another nurse at the hospital, stole the drugs. Kyle brings Scotty back to Erinsborough, so Georgia can get some closure. Georgia tries to take care of Kyle when his eyesight is damaged during an eclipse, but Kyle becomes frustrated and he briefly breaks up with her. Georgia joins Karl and Ajay Kapoor's (Sachin Joab) band The Right Prescription. After seeing a video of Georgia singing, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) offers Georgia a contract to sing solo at Charlie's. Georgia struggles when she is unable to save Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko) and begins cancelling shifts at the hospital. She decides to give up her nursing career to pursue singing full-time. When she saves Jack Lassiter's (Alan Hopgood) life, Georgia asks Paul to be let out of her contract, but he refuses. Georgia finds it hard coping with two careers and Kyle notices that she is constantly tired. Paul gives Georgia's song to another artist, Amali Ward, but Amali gives the song back to Georgia and she tells Paul that the proceeds from the sale of the song will go to charity. Paul sues Georgia for breach of contract, but later drops the case. Georgia's cousin Gem (Kathryn Beck) arrives in town and fails to get on with Kate. Georgia and Kyle get engaged, and decide to move in together. During their engagement party, Georgia reads out an email from Kate detailing her one-night stand with Kyle. Georgia ends her relationship with Kyle and her friendship with Kate. Gem uses Georgia's grief to isolate her from everyone, and they decide to go to the country for a while. While there, Georgia gets a text explaining that Gem hacked Kate's laptop and printed out the email. Georgia confronts Gem, who turns nasty and pushes Georgia backwards into the cooker, starting the gas. Gem pushes Georgia again and she is knocked unconscious. Gem leaves Georgia alone in the cabin as it fills up with gas. Kate finds Georgia in time and she only suffers from mild gas inhalation and a minor head injury. Georgia discovers she is pregnant and decides to keep the news from Kyle, as she discovers he is in a relationship with Kate. Kyle eventually finds out about the pregnancy, after Georgia faints and is taken to hospital. When she decides to move back home, Kyle proves to her that he can provide for their baby and she agrees to stay in Erinsborough. Georgia has a miscarriage and she tries to move on without Kyle. However, after Kate dies, Georgia realises life is too short and they reconcile. Kyle spends several weeks in Thailand and when he returns, Georgia fears he has lost interest in her, but Kyle assures her he loves her and he and Georgia get engaged for a second time. Georgia tries to help out Kyle's business by getting him a job making beds for the hospital. Kyle is unhappy with Georgia when he learns that she has been secretly paying him, but they make up and set a day for the wedding. Sheila takes over the planning for their wedding, leading them to fall out with her when she organises a lavish engagement party. They also try to reconcile Sheila with her daughter, Naomi (Morgana O'Reilly). When Georgia develops a sore throat, Karl examines her and tells her she has a large nodule on her vocal chord. Georgia opts to have surgery to remove it, in case it turns cancerous. The surgery goes well, but shortly afterwards, Georgia begins coughing up blood. She is rushed back into surgery and Karl explains that the incision reopened, but Georgia will be okay. Kyle stays with Georgia while she recovers. Georgia briefly goes missing as a tornado hits Erinsborough, when she has to chase after Kyle's dog Bossy. Kyle goes out looking for her and he disappears. The following day, Georgia finds him trapped in a portable toilet. Karl informs Georgia that there is severe scarring on her vocal chords and it is highly unlikely she will ever sing again. Georgia suspects that there has been some misconduct by her surgeon, Jessica Girdwood, and that Karl is covering for her. An investigation later finds that there was no negligence on Dr Girdwood's behalf, and Georgia apologises to Karl. During their joint bucks and hens nights, Georgia and Kyle find Chris with serious head injuries outside The Waterhole. Georgia questions whether Chris's boyfriend Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt), an Afghanistan veteran, could have been the perpetrator. However, Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) confesses, and Georgia apologises to Nate. She is upset when Toadie agrees to represent Josh in court, and refuses to support him as a result. After Kyle sees Georgia in her wedding dress, he suspects that their wedding is cursed. He then loses the ring in the lake and his friend Honga cannot make the ceremony. Georgia drives to Frankston to convince him to come, but her car battery goes flat and her phone dies, so she has to hitch a ride back to Erinsborough. Georgia and Kyle then marry without any problems in front of their family and friends. Kyle asks Georgia to try for another baby and she agrees to throw away her contraceptive pills, but changes her mind as she fears having another miscarriage. Sheila finds out and Georgia tells Kyle. They agree to wait until they are both ready. Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou) befriends and flirts with Georgia. She soon finds out that Nick made a bet with Paul that he can have sex with her. Nick tries to pass it off as a joke, but Georgia pours her drink over him. After a patient's details are posted on Georgia's social networking site, she is suspended from work. She tries to find evidence that Nick set her up and gains entry to his hotel room. She copies his hard drive to a USB stick and hides it as Nick enters the room. She calls the police herself and is arrested, but manages to give the USB to Kyle. Karl later informs Georgia that she has been fired from the hospital. Georgia discovers that Paul's medical records match those of another patient, and thereby deduces that Paul never had leukaemia. She tells Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) and he questions Nick. When IT find that Nick deleted Paul's patient files in a bid to cover up his crime, he is arrested. Karl tells Georgia that the hospital board have reinstated her job, but she will receive no apology or compensation. When Georgia learns that her mother, Rhonda (Kim Denman) has cancer again, she manages to get her into a specialist clinic in Germany. Georgia becomes distracted while treating Nell (Scarlett Anderson) and almost gives her an overdose of paracetamol. She apologises and takes some leave from the hospital, before deciding to join her mother in Germany. Georgia tells Kyle to stay behind for his business and join her later. After an impromptu farewell party with her friends and family, Georgia leaves for Munich. Georgia and Kyle speak via Skype, but communication between them decreases. Angie contacts Georgia and learns Rhonda's treatment has been successful, so they are coming home. Georgia arrives back to find that Kyle has been visited by Greg Keys, a man she met in Germany. She admits that they had a moment, but nothing physical happened between them. Georgia asks Kyle for a year apart and tells him not to wait for her, before leaving. Months later, Georgia returns to Erinsborough and asks Kyle to meet her at Lassiter's Hotel. Georgia explains that she has got a job at the German clinic her mother was treated at. She tells Kyle that she still loves him and wants him back. They kiss and Georgia gives Kyle a ticket to Germany. They kiss again, but are interrupted by Kyle's new girlfriend Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). Kyle chases after Amy, and shortly after the boiler room explodes. Kyle and Amy get out of the hotel, and Kyle leaves Erinsborough to be with Georgia in Germany. A few years later, Kyle returns to Erinsborough and tells his family that he and Georgia have separated. Reception Thomas Mitchell from TV Week called Georgia an \\"Erinsborough hottie\\". Peter Munro from The Sydney Morning Herald branded the character \\"goofy\\" and noted that she was not even sure what month it was. Melinda Houston from The Sun-Herald said that Georgia was \\"understandably upset\\" when she learned the truth about Scotty. Of the character's reaction to Scotty's secret, Anthony D. Langford from TheBacklot.com commented \\"I find Georgia unraveling about what happened with Scotty to be a bit much since she wasn't in love with Scotty and would have dumped him for Kyle if given half the chance.\\" He added that Georgia's \\"coolness\\" towards Chris was logical though, given the state of mind she was in. A Newcastle Herald reporter thought Georgia was \\"carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders\\" when she was worrying about getting fired. In June 2013, The Daily Telegraph's Dianne Butler stated \\"Georgia's a gorgeous crowd- pulling blonde, but she's as dumb as furniture.\\" Langford disliked Georgia's exit storyline, commenting \\"I know the actress has left the show, but that‚Äôs a weird way to write her out.\\" References External links * Georgia Brooks at the Official AU Neighbours website * Georgia Brooks at the Official UK Neighbours website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional nurses Category:Fictional singers Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Georgia Brooks"},{"id":"39159234","text":"Dadalƒ± is a village in Tarsus district of Mersin Province, Turkey.

It had a most unusual layout, with an engine buried in the fuselage driving a pusher configuration propeller behind a cruciform tail. It was not successful and soon abandoned. Design Apart from its rear mounted pusher propeller, shaft driven from a centrally mounted engine, the W-1 was unusual in other respects. It was an all-metal aircraft; a single bay biplane with constant chord, equal span, unswept and unstaggered wings, braced by parallel interplane struts assisted by flying wires. There were ailerons on both upper and lower planes, externally connected. The deep, flat sided and flat topped fuselage entirely filled the interwing space, with the pilot's open cockpit immediately level with and ahead of the upper wing leading edge. He had twin machine guns faired into the upper surface ahead of him and, beyond, a smooth, rounded nose. The absence of engine and propeller gave him a good forward view and avoided the need for engine-gun synchronisation. The engine was behind him at the aircraft's centre of gravity (cg), totally enclosed within the fuselage. An intake into the underside of the fuselage immediately below the cockpit provided cooling air for the Clerget 7Z rotary engine, which had an exhaust in the upper fuselage. The fuselage tapered both in height and width to the tail, where the tailplane and split elevators were mounted on its upper surface. The upper fin and rudder was quite short but the lower part extended well below the lower wing in level flight. All the tail surfaces had curved leading edges; the two blade propeller was immediately behind their straight trailing edges. The W-1's undercarriage was also unusual. Though the mainwheels were conventionally positioned close to the cg and mounted on a rigid single axle attached to the fuselage by a pair of V-struts, it had a nosewheel of about the same diameter; unlike that of modern tricycle gear it was well above the ground when the aircraft was in the level flight position. On the ground the W-1 rested level on its mainwheels and a tailskid on the tall lower fin. The W-1 made only two short test flights, the first in the autumn of 1915, which revealed severe and ultimately insurmountable cooling problem with the buried engine. The development programme was abandoned in December 1915.

Augsbury for the Canadian George Hall Coal & Shipping Corporation in 1922. She went on to sail for a variety of different owners, and was renamed Granby in 1927, Parita II in 1948, Valbruna in 1951, Lawrencecliffe Hall in 1952, Federal Explorer in 1955 and finally Ithaka in 1960, before being wrecked on the Canadian coast later that year. Career She was built as the lake freighter Frank A. Augsbury for the George Hall Coal Company by Fraser, Brace, Ltd., of Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec and launched on 21 October 1922. Frank A. Augsbury was and by with draught of powered by a triple expansion steam engine fired by two Scotch marine boilers burning coal. She was sold to Canada Steamship Lines in 1927 and renamed Granby. She was taken over by the Ministry of War Transport and managed during the Second World War by France, Fenwick and Company. On 28 June 1945 Granby collided with the British off the West Goodwins, and was holed aft above the waterline. Granby was taken to the Downs, and on 2 July was towed to Gravesend by the tugboats Empire Larch and Empire Mary. On 3 August she left Gravesend under tow and was laid up in the River Blackwater. She was sold to the Panamanian firm Cia Naviera Parita S.A. in 1948 and renamed Parita II, sailing for them until 1951, when she was acquired by the Italian shipping company Lloyd Mediterraneo S.p.A. di Nav., and renamed Valbruna. In 1952 she was bought by the successor company of her original owners, now trading as the Hall Corporation of Canada, Ltd., and returned to Canada under the name Lawrencecliffe Hall. She was sold again in 1955, this time to the Federal Commerce & Navigation Co., Ltd, who renamed her Federal Explorer. Federal Commerce and Navigation used her as a supply ship to communities on the Canadian Arctic seaboard, twice chartering her to the Clarke Steamship Company in 1956, and using her to open the Federal Intercoastal Line in 1957. The Federal Explorer, under her master, Captain Simon Bouchard, delivered parts for new nickel mill under construction in Rankin Inlet in 1956 and also delivered cargoes of fuel oil to Royal Canadian Air Force stations in the Arctic. In 1958 she carried nickel concentrates to Churchill, Manitoba for shipment by rail to Fort Saskatchewan, and then delivered a cargo of grain from Churchill to Montreal in late October. Final sale and wreck Federal Explorer was sold for the final time, to the Ithaka Shipping Company in 1960, and was registered in Nassau, Bahamas by her owner, a Greek named J. Glikis. She was chartered to the Clarke Steamship Company to deliver nickel concentrate from the works at Rankin Inlet, and sailed from Churchill on 10 September 1960 to collect her cargo, carrying supplies for the settlement. She was caught in a severe gale while making the voyage, losing her rudder. She dropped anchor, but the anchors failed to hold, and she ran aground in Bird Cove, about ten miles east of Churchill, on 14 September. She had delivered her first shipment of 3,000 tons of ore to Churchill, and had loaded a small amount of mining equipment and a building supplies, for a return trip, but she encountered a storm with 80 mile per hour winds. The captain turned back to the safety of the port. But the weather was so bad that he decided to drop anchor. The anchor chain broke and her rudder was beaten off. Completely out of control the vessel was driven into Bird Cove, from Churchill, Manitoba, running onto a shallow gravel-bank off shore. Her bottom was completely ripped out when the storm pounded her on the gravel bank. The insurers, Lloyd's of London, wrote off the vessel as a complete loss, but regarding the grounding as suspicious, refused to pay the insurance claim. All 37 crew members were rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard's and were landed at Winnipeg, Manitoba on 18 September. The shallow water she grounded in meant that people could walk to the wreck at low tide, and her navigating instruments and much of her cargo, consisting of two generators and some plywood panels, as well as mission supplies, were salvaged.
